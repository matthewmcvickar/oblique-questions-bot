  "1570": "But where are the huts?",
  "1571": "What would be the use?",
  "1572": "But how did she become so?",
  "1573": "As before?",
  "1574": "But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge?",

  "1588": "For if we fail in this our fight he must surely win, and then where end we?",
  "1589": "The great question certainly was, what?",
  "1590": "He supposed he was right?",
  "1591": "Is nothing due to the man whom we have all such reason to love, and no reason in the world to think ill of?",
  "1592": "But when you are not sure whether it is a fact or not, what are you to do?",
  "1593": "Would you like to see 'em?",

  "1604": "Is this just?",
  "1605": "But how can you get there?",
  "1606": "Would you help me?",
  "1607": "What of the race, my pulse?",
  "1608": "What right had they to weep over or to talk about her?",
  "1609": "What's he like, this lad?",

  "1654": "And how do you feel about it?",
  "1655": "What are fireworks like?",
  "1656": "Whom am I and what am I?",

  "1665": "Well, that wasn't very far, was it?",
  "1666": "And why not a bowl of rack punch as well as any other cause?",
  "1667": "Would it be some young man or other whom she takes an interest in?",
  "1668": "Is it absolutely necessary to go on with the letter, darling?",
  "1669": "Is that a genuine letter you are reading?",
  "1670": "What could be better?",
  "1671": "What has she been telling you?",
  "1672": "Why is that little, and the little freedom they enjoy, to be infringed?",
  "1673": "Had I been remanded to my dungeon, to await the next sacrifice, which would not take place for many months?",
  "1674": "Will she recover?",
  "1675": "And so you like this man's sisters, too, do you?",
  "1676": "Is that what you mean?",
  "1677": "What do you mean by going with other men, anyway?",
  "1678": "Where's the lecture room, d'you know?",

  "1683": "And yet what?",
  "1684": "Why risk the world's great empire for a punk?",
  "1685": "You mean, spend too much money?",
  "1686": "Shall, then, this bow take the life of many a chief among us, merely because you cannot bend it yourself?",
  "1687": "Nose and all?",
  "1688": "You desired a confessor?",
  "1689": "And will you answer it?",
  "1690": "How, then, will competition be harmoniously determined in society?",
  "1691": "Have I got to drink that stuff?",
  "1692": "Ruined her?",
  "1693": "So that I need not make use of this petition?",

  "1728": "In the same way?",
  "1729": "What was your remark, my dear friend?",
  "1730": "Why do you answer me so roughly?",
  "1731": "What's going to become of us now?",

  "2167": "Will you give me your opinion of it?",
  "2168": "Oh, was he?",
  "2169": "No guarantee?",
  "2170": "What little imp is this?",
  "2171": "Who would use money and position better than he meant to use them?",
  "2172": "Run after it?",
  "2173": "Whose dog is it?",
  "2174": "And then, are you really acting according to your conscience, or are you acting in order to be admired of men?",
  "2175": "They had the sun to go by, certainly, when they started, but who could say how long it would last?",
  "2176": "Why ask us to do what you will not do yourselves?",
  "2177": "From companions in peril, would they not again be avowed rivals?",
  "2178": "Would you let me play your part for one night?",
  "2179": "And would he try to go beyond just action?",
  "2180": "Did you ever see such a handsome, strapping girl?",
  "2181": "What else have we been talking about?",
  "2182": "From where have you got them all?",
  "2183": "Who is the man?",
  "2184": "Who I, sir?",
  "2185": "Is it right to do men to death like this?",
  "2186": "Have ye shipped in her?",
  "2187": "It's a woman?",
  "2188": "Is its pattern strange to you?",
  "2189": "Your stepfather saved her?",
  "2190": "Can you help me find my way?",
  "2191": "Sir, said I, I hope you won't be angry, but, saving yourself, do you think they are painted worse than they deserve?",
  "2192": "Is not that verily a sanctifying of his holy name?",
  "2193": "And how about them?",
  "2194": "Nor exactly a bird?",
  "2195": "How am I mistaken in her?",
  "2196": "Did you marry three wives maybe?",
  "2197": "Do you wish me to give it up?",
  "2198": "Which is it you wish to hear?",
  "2199": "What talk is this of choosing?",
  "2200": "How shall I rhyme in this eternal roar?",
  "2201": "Any men that came along?",
  "2202": "Why not open my mind's eye for me?",
  "2203": "And whence did we obtain our knowledge?",
  "2204": "And pray what sort of guardians do you make?",
  "2205": "Never there?",
  "2206": "Do you see what I see?",
  "2207": "Or when he roasted it?",
  "2208": "What need that we should insults interchange?",
  "2209": "They don't look grave and mysterious, as if they had heard something strange?",
  "2210": "Why have you that silk frock on, then?",
  "2211": "Do you think about it?",
  "2212": "Isn't it so, lads?",
  "2213": "But suppose the wind were to sweep it off, so that he couldn't come back toward us?",
  "2214": "Who is it that calls?",
  "2215": "How could she do less for him than he was so anxious to do for her?",
  "2216": "No doubt he was in a pitiable position, but how could that be helped?",
  "2217": "You mean you really don't know?",
  "2218": "Have you not received any?",
  "2219": "What is changed?",
  "2220": "Why not be bestial, and go the whole round of experience?",
  "2221": "Have I upset you?",
  "2222": "How had she known that he it was, that is, that it was he?",
  "2223": "Did she fancy that he had meant to attack her with it?",
  "2224": "You remember, I said, how the rulers were chosen before?",
  "2225": "Do you think there is no weaker brother among all our lodges that could not be bought?",
  "2226": "And kill them?",
  "2227": "To fairs, markets, races, and so forth, I suppose?",
  "2228": "Why are YOU tramping?",
  "2229": "Am I to proceed in my work?",
  "2230": "Graduating well, you mean?",
  "2231": "Why is it that we hesitate?",
  "2232": "Or have you not begun to think about it yet?",
  "2233": "Surely by this time you ought to be able to understand something?",
  "2234": "Who are YOU in this establishment?",
  "2235": "Would not any decent soldier smite him across the face instead of grasping him by the hand?",
  "2236": "Lonely, like the devil, and envious like him?",
  "2237": "But how came he to have so singular a companion?",
  "2238": "Do I understand that he asked for more, after he had eaten the supper allotted by the dietary?",
  "2239": "Had he said anything to give himself away?",
  "2240": "Were they possibly the earth beating time?",
  "2241": "Was he poking fun, or not?",
  "2242": "What's the matter with this fellow?",
  "2243": "Sikes is not, I suppose?",
  "2244": "Why should I tell you what you cannot alter?",
  "2245": "Shall I go to her?",
  "2246": "Is he not, duke?",
  "2247": "And how old were you at that time?",
  "2248": "Why should we not all go?",
  "2249": "I ask what this pretended revolution has revolutionized?",
  "2250": "Do you suppose they keep vodka for sale?",
  "2251": "For how long a time?",
  "2252": "He could be neither of these things, for he had never heard of them, but do you think he is to be pitied for that?",
  "2253": "What makes you think so?",
  "2254": "I do not know, and what if I did?",
  "2255": "What is soon done, sir?",
  "2256": "Is that what you're waiting about for?",
  "2257": "How came ye to talk about that?",
  "2258": "There is a certain formidable machine, have you seen it?",
  "2259": "You hear, D'Artagnan?",
  "2260": "In other words, what are the most salient episodes and the most remarkable phases of the war between labor and capital?",
  "2261": "Ah, really?",
  "2262": "It would be a grand thing for one of those girls, wouldn't it?",
  "2263": "But how is it that you do these things?",
  "2264": "What is it about your pay?",
  "2265": "Had I not recognised that day, for the hundredth time, what I was worth?",
  "2266": "And you don't think me as handsome as your grandfather?",
  "2267": "Was this another hallucination?",
  "2268": "But, tell me, you have no one else staying here, have you?",
  "2269": "Do they display their charms merely to amuse them?",
  "2270": "Shall we use these, and so be even as to weapons?",
  "2271": "And why should you expect me to take you out riding?",
  "2272": "And what is it done in?",
  "2273": "What, then, are the conditions, the LAWS, of human society?",
  "2274": "Why not, indeed, seeing that at least it would have brought comfort to the poor people of this place?",
  "2275": "It was your play, I believe?",
  "2276": "Yes, monsieur, but once more, to what purpose are all these questions?",
  "2277": "And why now, my pretty simplicity?",
  "2278": "Besides, who knows?",
  "2279": "Why can't people take a line and stick to it?",
  "2280": "Which means, I suppose, that you refuse the service which I asked of you?",
  "2281": "Anything wrong?",
  "2282": "I suppose he can wait below?",
  "2283": "I suppose you have heard what's been happening to the beauty on the hill?",
  "2284": "Whose is that light which makes the eye to see perfectly and the visible to appear?",
  "2285": "The boys weep, and do you not think it is right that a father should weep?",
  "2286": "And what would he have done, the loafer, tell me, what would he have done?",
  "2287": "And what is doing?",
  "2288": "Is there a flood?",
  "2289": "How far had he walked?",
  "2290": "Your second brother?",
  "2291": "Because every one who may have anything to tell, you hold, will have been so squared?",
  "2292": "What was the use of sending for him?",
  "2293": "And where does he come from?",
  "2294": "What is it, duke?",
  "2295": "Pythangelus?",
  "2296": "I was going to ask, mama, before you were married, had you many suitors?",
  "2297": "Why should you hate the moon?",
  "2298": "Do you know the chapel?",
  "2299": "Who IS it?",
  "2300": "Where are all the eyes that heretofore watched me?",
  "2301": "Know you not, then, that your life is my life, and your death my death?",
  "2302": "Have you relatives?",
  "2303": "She may be free?",
  "2304": "Where is their road?",
  "2305": "Why not attack at once?",
  "2306": "What is allowed, then?",
  "2307": "Is she kind as she is fair?",
  "2308": "But where could such a hound lie concealed, where did it get its food, where did it come from, how was it that no one saw it by day?",
  "2309": "Have we made an erroneous interpretation of the document?",
  "2310": "Let me go on your bob?",
  "2311": "And what if I think to kill you now?",
  "2312": "And you will tell me this secret?",
  "2313": "Because we loved, and dared to say so, and even boasted of it?",
  "2314": "Is this body destined for such work?",
  "2315": "Your majesty is joking, have you not a million?",
  "2316": "Is there nothing you could take to give you present relief?",
  "2317": "Ought you to feel discouraged?",
  "2318": "To be sure, he who never liveth at the right time, how could he ever die at the right time?",
  "2319": "What will become of her now?",
  "2320": "What are you coming for?",
  "2321": "What's pretence?",
  "2322": "Hadn't I better play something?",
  "2323": "And why did you wish to see me?",
  "2324": "Call?",
  "2325": "Was it possible that we were on our way down through the mountains again?",
  "2326": "Well, what DO you know of him?",
  "2327": "A woman or an ape?",
  "2328": "Day?",
  "2329": "Who said I would not go?",
  "2330": "What was that?",
  "2331": "How is it he leaves me alone in my misery?",
  "2332": "What is the use of preserving slang?",
  "2333": "But what have I done to inspire you with such a feeling of thankfulness?",
  "2334": "You have, then, fulfilled my command, and composed a new interlude?",
  "2335": "The mysterious speaker?",
  "2336": "And how should I be able to recognize, and know, and designate by name what is strange to me, and what I have never before felt?",
  "2337": "No divisions?",
  "2338": "You don't mean you are coming with us?",
  "2339": "For your marriage?",
  "2340": "Did they want to kill you?",
  "2341": "Am I in the right?",
  "2342": "Brickmakers, eh?",
  "2343": "Well, what does it all mean?",
  "2344": "To anybody?",
  "2345": "What do you hope, then?",
  "2346": "Well, would you mind my reforming myself this afternoon?",
  "2347": "Then you know me?",
  "2348": "What about meals?",
  "2349": "ART SICK?",
  "2350": "And what did he do?",
  "2351": "And her brother?",
  "2352": "You have heerd tell of cotton rags dipt in turpentine, hav'nt you, how they produce combustion?",
  "2353": "But what appeal could it be?",
  "2354": "Wrong?",
  "2355": "Do you want me to tell everything?",
  "2356": "Rob suggested?",
  "2357": "And is the soul in agreement with the affections of the body?",
  "2358": "Would you like this room, sir?",
  "2359": "What do I hear?",
  "2360": "Shall I stop the boat and try to get you out here?",
  "2361": "And are you prepared to meet the cost?",
  "2362": "You?",
  "2363": "Markova?",
  "2364": "You haven't any place to go, have you?",
  "2365": "What is there for us?",
  "2366": "Besides, shall we not bear the lords of the habitable earth to be lords over us, and yet bear tyrants of our own country?",
  "2367": "When, and in what month?",
  "2368": "But what are we to do with him?",
  "2369": "Why can you not bear them?",
  "2370": "I wonder if all the things move along with us?",
  "2371": "Why this negation, if a modification was sufficient?",
  "2372": "Was this idolized parent still in existence?",
  "2373": "Who follows me?",
  "2374": "But how in the name of all that's wonderful does he GET OUT?",
  "2375": "Could the professor throw any light upon that?",
  "2376": "Can't we be good friends?",
  "2377": "Could it be possible that the sense of unreality in which he felt himself imprisoned had communicated itself to his wife?",
  "2378": "Why alas?",
  "2379": "What do you mean by that, monsieur?",
  "2380": "After having met with so many who promised, when shall I find one who will give?",
  "2381": "What the deuce are you talking about?",
  "2382": "Coffins, where?",
  "2383": "You are not in debt, then?",
  "2384": "Why should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice of the people?",
  "2385": "I love you, I?",
  "2386": "Surely there is no necessity for you to say one word, mama?",
  "2387": "That's eight months she has been away, surely?",
  "2388": "Who shall go in?",
  "2389": "Will you sell them for five francs?",
  "2390": "Why negotiate, and above all why retreat, when to retreat is so contrary to his method of conducting war?",
  "2391": "You wanted to speak to her?",
  "2392": "But am I not your nearest relative?",
  "2393": "Then what do you think, mother, has become of 'em?",
  "2394": "You have written to your father?",
  "2395": "Ought it not?",
  "2396": "Did he tell you so himself?",
  "2397": "The ladies are great observers, sir?",
  "2398": "Are you come to do anything in my way, sir?",
  "2399": "Have you honours?",
  "2400": "I may marry somebody when I grow up but I'm far too young to be thinking of it yet, don't you think, teacher?",
  "2401": "Suppose, now, I could give you up to a rich man who would be able to insure you against all wants?",
  "2402": "If so, why is it not among his papers?",
  "2403": "What's your name, portress?",
  "2404": "How big is this hole?",
  "2405": "Jest t' pull me along outer th' road?",
  "2406": "Hear you how they are sawing and hammering there below?",
  "2407": "Don't ye love sperm?",
  "2408": "Now what say you to aluminum, gentlemen?",
  "2409": "How much am I worth?",
  "2410": "And the cards I ordered to be engraved as soon as you knew the number of the house?",
  "2411": "What put that in your head?",
  "2412": "Had she never looked for the door?",
  "2413": "Everything?",
  "2414": "Do you think he will object to it?",
  "2415": "What think you of such a song as this?",
  "2416": "Have they not heard that of their colonel?",
  "2417": "Who was the gentleman?",
  "2418": "How could he have me in view, and not be aware of it himself?",
  "2419": "What is your name?",
  "2420": "How did I take to it?",
  "2421": "And she is getting on well, you say?",
  "2422": "Have you anything to ask, sire, before we part?",
  "2423": "Are you mad?",
  "2424": "And what does it mean?",
  "2425": "Now, then, who are you?",
  "2426": "Why do I wish to unite you two?",
  "2427": "Do I look like a sweep, then?",
  "2428": "Why, how fail to understand?",
  "2429": "You understand me?",
  "2430": "Brownlow, I believe, sir?",
  "2431": "Why have I always to complain of you?",
  "2432": "But you killed nobody yourselves?",
  "2433": "Why do you pity them?",
  "2434": "Yes, but could not the mistake be rectified?",
  "2435": "What is the matter, said he, my chicken?",
  "2436": "Am I not to know to whom to present it?",
  "2437": "I say, madam, what do you propose to do with these papers?",
  "2438": "Yes, d'you want anything?",
  "2439": "Are we ready?",
  "2440": "Have you any better explanation?",
  "2441": "Who was it gave me that rogues' march from the stocks to the gallows's foot?",
  "2442": "Why, pray?",
  "2443": "Now could I speak of that which is not yet?",
  "2444": "What is the proprietor?",
  "2445": "Would you mind stepping in for a moment?",
  "2446": "Shall I say yes or shall I say no?",
  "2447": "What should you be out of spirits for?",
  "2448": "Do you always want to be fooled?",
  "2449": "At this last moment I ask you, have we not long been betrothed to each other in our secret hearts?",
  "2450": "Ripping, isn't it?",
  "2451": "If you hadn't a been dogged, where'd you a been now?",
  "2452": "When did this happen?",
  "2453": "Something about somebody laughing at a locksmith?",
  "2454": "For what are you fighting?",
  "2455": "And that is adding insult to injury, is it?",
  "2456": "And where will I look for 'em?",
  "2457": "Or failed to do anything you ordered?",
  "2458": "Gentlemen, is that a true view of the case?",
  "2459": "It was with a hilted knife maybe?",
  "2460": "Was he really doing everything that could be expected of him?",
  "2461": "How fare ye?",
  "2462": "What noise was that?",
  "2463": "But will the person who shall accompany you afterward be a man or a woman?",
  "2464": "Yes, but how am I to give it up?",
  "2465": "We may depend on you?",
  "2466": "Does it really seem so to you?",
  "2467": "You've been tramping in the sun, and it's a very warm night, and hadn't you better sleep over the notion?",
  "2468": "And you really live by the river?",
  "2469": "Shall not the grief of the old time follow?",
  "2470": "Couldn't you manage to hold me in your arms?",
  "2471": "Isn't he very rich?",
  "2472": "Some authentic relic?",
  "2473": "Why are you not at work?",
  "2474": "Why did I suddenly loose my grip of her?",
  "2475": "Sure you did?",
  "2476": "Sylvestre?",
  "2477": "An't that as nat'ral as a sheep's bleating, or a pig's grunting, or a horse's neighing, or a bird's singing?",
  "2478": "Was it a kind of adoration for so much purity?",
  "2479": "It would have embarrassed what?",
  "2480": "Would you prefer a more humble life, a life more suited to your strength?",
  "2481": "What he?",
  "2482": "What did you suppose, then?",
  "2483": "Did we not finish it?",
  "2484": "Will you be mine?",
  "2485": "He did not proceed to blows?",
  "2486": "What else had she herself meant three minutes before by speaking of her as great?",
  "2487": "Why has the legislator given hands to this conspiracy of monopolies, to this interdict upon theories belonging to all?",
  "2488": "And do you suppose it weighs on him any less than on you?",
  "2489": "Do you wish these proofs, these attestations, which I alone possess, to be destroyed?",
  "2490": "Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?",
  "2491": "You do not like?",
  "2492": "You are going to be married?",
  "2493": "And will you, sir, get your living by the counsel of traitors?",
  "2494": "Wot job?",
  "2495": "What happened in the house?",
  "2496": "Why do you not ask the fisherman for his cutlass?",
  "2497": "Have you forgotten, my lord, that it is he who answered for me to the queen?",
  "2498": "If harm befell him, what would be our fate?",
  "2499": "You mark me sir?",
  "2500": "And what would you yourself say?",
  "2501": "Do you think, gentlemen, that I look like an innkeeper?",
  "2502": "Did you ever see him?",
  "2503": "And yet you say he is not a medical student?",
  "2504": "Are there children or are there not?",
  "2505": "What is he?",
  "2506": "Where have they been put?",
  "2507": "How does my sweet lady?",
  "2508": "And what was his purpose?",
  "2509": "Ah, you know it?",
  "2510": "Why don't they jump in and destroy these fliers?",
  "2511": "But with a beard, you tell me?",
  "2512": "But, on the other hand, whose blood was that which lay so thickly upon the floor?",
  "2513": "Well, what did you see, sir, or think you saw?",
  "2514": "What was taking place within him?",
  "2515": "You love me, don't you?",
  "2516": "What did you force me to run away with you for?",
  "2517": "Did I groan all right?",
  "2518": "Known what?",
  "2519": "You, my poor child, suffer poverty and hunger?",
  "2520": "Was it by his extensive knowledge, by his exquisite judgment, or by his heroic valour?",
  "2521": "Whose language would he speak?",
  "2522": "Yer powers wasn't enough to carry 'ee through?",
  "2523": "Perhaps you would care to try?",
  "2524": "Why should he change his name in a country where no one knew his original one?",
  "2525": "What can it know about the matter?",
  "2526": "Shall we begin education with music, and go on to gymnastic afterwards?",
  "2527": "Shall we try it?",
  "2528": "I hope I have not driven her away?",
  "2529": "Where does he come in?",
  "2530": "Why have you hatched these vipers which, when they shall have grown, will inflict injury on all, beginning with yourself?",
  "2531": "What have I seen?",
  "2532": "Am not I dreaming?",
  "2533": "Am I to say what you told me?",
  "2534": "What could be more just?",
  "2535": "How many shots?",
  "2536": "Why did he leave?",
  "2537": "Well, and what then?",
  "2538": "Do you pity him?",
  "2539": "To be cased up and hung by on the wall?",
  "2540": "Sword?",
  "2541": "You heard what I said to the prince?",
  "2542": "What's to be done?",
  "2543": "Are there any good men?",
  "2544": "Diminish public burdens, assess taxes on a more equitable basis?",
  "2545": "Who can deny that one's physical conditions determine one's character or personality?",
  "2546": "How am I to know?",
  "2547": "I have sent for three of my friends, but who knows whether they were at home?",
  "2548": "A qui cette voiture la?",
  "2549": "Or when he gathered it?",
  "2550": "I say, aren't we much too soon?",
  "2551": "Do you like it?",
  "2552": "And who is there that will either take the trouble or incur the odium, of a strict scrunity into the secret springs of the transaction?",
  "2553": "Are the other children in bed?",
  "2554": "Does he make it against that newspaper editor merely?",
  "2555": "Why torture me now?",
  "2556": "Abideth there husband for me, after the son of my uncle?",
  "2557": "Or have you dined?",
  "2558": "Cur aliquid vidi?",
  "2559": "Or, was he?",
  "2560": "Had you ever seen it before?",
  "2561": "Have I positive and substantive proof of what I assert?",
  "2562": "How could you let it go so?",
  "2563": "Why should I look at the letter?",
  "2564": "Won't you please be good enough to send my tea into the library?",
  "2565": "But how did it turn out with me?",
  "2566": "You won't want another dog, will you?",
  "2567": "The prosecutor was reading, was he?",
  "2568": "Well, sirs, is everybody here?",
  "2569": "How are they when you've done?",
  "2570": "And you are still satisfied?",
  "2571": "How shall I understand you?",
  "2572": "But what do the young woman say herself about it?",
  "2573": "And will you tell me what you read therein, monseigneur?",
  "2574": "Would it not be a wilful throwing away of a chance not to avail himself of it?",
  "2575": "Pray, sir, what is the soul?",
  "2576": "The child, my child?",

  "3956": "Only when will all that be?",
  "3957": "Where are you going to?",
  "3958": "What could he say?",
  "3959": "What would have me do?",
  "3960": "The conditions, monseigneur?",
  "3961": "Isn't it selfish of him?",
  "3962": "Perhaps you will have the kindness to take a card of terms with you?",
  "3963": "Well, what's to be done if it cannot be avoided?",
  "3964": "What does this mean?",
  "3965": "Are you quite a stranger to me, sir?",
  "3966": "Has she the right to be?",

  "3978": "Is he giving us the slip?",
  "3979": "I have not influenced him, have I?",
  "3980": "You have not seen him since yesterday?",
  "3981": "Can you tell me who are the poorest people you have got here?",
  "3982": "Who does know?",

  "4665": "Well, what is it, then?",
  "4666": "Will you ask her if I may go to see her?",
  "4667": "How's this?",
  "4668": "Why do you say more often?",
  "4669": "Why, do you mean to say you couldn't have done it, if you had chosen?",
  "4670": "And how he knows me?",
  "4671": "Wickfield?",
  "4672": "But what good will rhythms do me for a living?",
  "4673": "Ben who?",
  "4674": "What do you tell me, child?",
  "4675": "You villain, will you finish?",
  "4676": "What do you say to that, doctor?",
  "4677": "Was that a mistake?",
  "4678": "D' you suppose I can't die like a gentleman?",
  "4679": "Tell me then truly, have I really got back to my own country?",
  "4680": "Is it there?",
  "4681": "What do you think of that?",
  "4682": "How was it?",
  "4683": "May I inquire who you are, and what is your business?",
  "4684": "If people are so silly as to indulge the sentiment, is it my fault?",
  "4685": "Where shall the weary soldier find his rest?",
  "4686": "Whom have you chosen to give you your cues?",
  "4687": "Shakespeare's sonnets?",
  "4688": "Slight, how will you do then?",
  "4689": "And it was they who told you something which made you angry?",
  "4690": "Why don't you be happy as well?",
  "4691": "Why do they use bronze for swords and spears, iron for tools?",
  "4692": "You see, do you not?",
  "4693": "What was the use of all these planks and boards?",
  "4694": "Then two are cheaper than one?",
  "4695": "Do you know, my dear fellow, why master pastrycooks never work with their hands?",
  "4696": "A secret of such a nature as to change his majesty's interests?",
  "4697": "Will you go, mother?",
  "4698": "Not listening?",
  "4699": "From me, then?",
  "4700": "Whom do you expect to find with me at this hour?",
  "4701": "Who told you, then, that the cardinal was dead?",
  "4702": "What then can we say of these prophets, but that they are impostors and liars?",
  "4703": "But if you direct us to apply to her excellency, would you graciously oblige us with her address?",
  "4704": "How did you find that they are now wise?",
  "4705": "Is it not rather far?",
  "4706": "But is there inner life expressed, or possible to be expressed, in any other form save physical organism?",
  "4707": "Of course they answer to their names?",
  "4708": "And was that it?",
  "4709": "Nothing?",
  "4710": "Alone, or with her husband?",
  "4711": "Will this prove it more?",
  "4712": "What use were anger and protestations against her silly credulity?",
  "4713": "Do you think it would content him, could he see me branding cattle and bargaining with bullock drivers?",
  "4714": "But, perhaps you have a better understanding of these things?",
  "4715": "After you've refused him?",
  "4716": "Come, shall we go?",
  "4717": "Do you hear the news?",
  "4718": "But where does one find it nowadays?",
  "4719": "Is your hand steady enough to write?",
  "4720": "She said she'd keep it safe, did she?",
  "4721": "Do you think that could be anything to a man who has struck down seven at one blow?",
  "4722": "Who is yon stranger clad all in scarlet?",
  "4723": "Would you wish the gentleman to be shown in, ma'am?",
  "4724": "Are you fond of pictures, dear?",
  "4725": "Is it quite fair to this young woman's memory to read at such length to a stranger what was intended for your eye alone?",
  "4726": "Or peace?",
  "4727": "So that's my young cousin, is it?",
  "4728": "You can do what you please when you go out, can't you?",
  "4729": "They?",
  "4730": "But could I do with a million?",
  "4731": "Would he allow himself to accept from any woman that of which she had stripped herself?",
  "4732": "Why had he not put them out for good?",
  "4733": "Because you are a fool must you die like a mouse under his foot?",
  "4734": "At home?",
  "4735": "Can you tell me what it is?",
  "4736": "Shall I ever forget the look which came over his face when the first warning pangs told him that the poison was in his system?",
  "4737": "Have I not always been ready to help you in word and deed, so far as it lay in my power?",
  "4738": "Where did you get the mark upon your forehead?",
  "4739": "Why do you shave your beard?",
  "4740": "Or is it not rather merely a repetition of the question?",
  "4741": "When did you come in?",
  "4742": "Didn't he owe us immense sums, all round?",
  "4743": "You are married, sir, I am told?",
  "4744": "And where was other aid to be found?",
  "4745": "Well, what about his assistants?",
  "4746": "And now what are we to do now?",
  "4747": "Who went out this morning?",
  "4748": "I understand that I wait for you under all circumstances?",
  "4749": "Is the way blocked?",
  "4750": "Who are the wizards?",
  "4751": "And you won't feel ashamed to write to him?",
  "4752": "Does he show any turn for any musical instrument?",
  "4753": "Do you think the family will stand for me?",
  "4754": "Who told you that I had not married her?",
  "4755": "What, you can begin to shed tears and offer me your hand?",
  "4756": "Who told you so?",
  "4757": "Men at all?",
  "4758": "Shall I send for another bottle?",
  "4759": "For surely, sir, you will not assert, that a duty can be binding which is not founded on reason?",
  "4760": "Is he going to steal the letters to submit them to somebody ashore?",
  "4761": "Is a democracy, such as we know it, the last improvement possible in government?",
  "4762": "Does that make any impression on your mind?",
  "4763": "Does he not say he will not strike his spars to any gale?",
  "4764": "Afraid?",
  "4765": "Where is the harm?",
  "4766": "What, do you still doubt, sire?",
  "4767": "Has tha' never seen them?",
  "4768": "For did he not take me when I was poor and naked?",
  "4769": "Well, will you judge between us?",
  "4770": "By what?",
  "4771": "But what can a monarchical talker say?",
  "4772": "Another turn, eh?",
  "4773": "So you are quite alone?",
  "4774": "Did they find the charm?",
  "4775": "My watch?",
  "4776": "Can you make that out?",
  "4777": "Oh, why must a man like that be made unhappy when there are lots of girls about who would worship the very ground he trod on?",
  "4778": "It's quite hot even now, isn't it?",
  "4779": "How can you bear, when you are borne yourself?",
  "4780": "What door would be closed to him?",
  "4781": "How do you know?",
  "4782": "Had he done well in that?",
  "4783": "Or, perhaps a little cordial?",
  "4784": "Do you now see that it was not he but I who moved you?",
  "4785": "Anybody hurt?",
  "4786": "Have you a family?",
  "4787": "Can't you splice it?",
  "4788": "Could not a man take a chirping bottle with you to taste your wine?",
  "4789": "Will you stop a moment and think over these words?",
  "4790": "Have you seen my mother?",
  "4791": "Well, and what do you see?",
  "4792": "Could he not see the danger he had run?",
  "4793": "When will what be?",
  "4794": "Have you made up your mind, my dear?",
  "4795": "Who then?",
  "4796": "What did I go and tell a lie for?",
  "4797": "Do you know the contents of this note, sir?",
  "4798": "But what are they to do?",
  "4799": "Why doesn't somebody start a yeoman party in politics, appealing to the old traditions of the small landowner?",
  "4800": "It's HIS daughter, is it?",
  "4801": "Why on earth should you wish that?",
  "4802": "Has he anything remarkable about him by which one may recognize him?",
  "4803": "Is he the author?",
  "4804": "You said just now you came hither to study topography?",
  "4805": "When will she be at length relieved from the burden of her royal crown?",
  "4806": "Why, why?",
  "4807": "Do you remember the story of that man in the hospital?",
  "4808": "And the avaricious, I said, is the oligarchical youth?",
  "4809": "Until some one rare and grand result is reached which may be good, and may be the reverse of good?",
  "4810": "Hey?",
  "4811": "Have you had that youngster with you long?",
  "4812": "Is he not rich enough to keep the estate in good order?",
  "4813": "What will he want with me?",
  "4814": "Not alone, are you?",
  "4815": "Wolves, jaguars, or apes?",
  "4816": "He said he knew them well enough, but what was there in that?",
  "4817": "But is it not a heavy load?",
  "4818": "Why wait here for the divorce?",
  "4819": "Disappointment?",
  "4820": "And have your notions changed?",
  "4821": "How shall we dare to think well of ourselves again?",
  "4822": "What of the country's people?",
  "4823": "We men are determined, nay, are we not pledged, to destroy this monster?",
  "4824": "A geographer would be of much use to our expedition, and what can be nobler than to bring science to the service of humanity?",
  "4825": "How on earth could any reasonable man expect a girl to let herself go at this stage of the proceedings?",
  "4826": "How do you manage?",
  "4827": "No pudding?",
  "4828": "Don't you reckon that the people that made the books knows what's the correct thing to do?",
  "4829": "Is he as young and handsome as uncle?",
  "4830": "Have you not eyes in your head?",
  "4831": "Would you suppose him to have a head and a heart full of romance yet?",
  "4832": "And not to use such expressions?",
  "4833": "What else could it have meant?",
  "4834": "All ready are you, my boy?",

  "4842": "What matters who sees me now?",
  "4843": "You have made the will, you round world of love?",
  "4844": "Have I done any wrong?",
  "4845": "And should also be given some supper, I suppose?",
  "4846": "You understand?",
  "4847": "How is the count?",
  "4848": "Not only so, but if you were to do so, how long would it take the courts to hold your votes unconstitutional and void?",
  "4849": "Why were you so scared of me?",
  "4850": "Is he ill?",
  "4851": "What are you doing here?",

  "4981": "Yesterday morning?",
  "4982": "What is that empty coffin?",
  "4983": "How is it that I am writing to you?",
  "4984": "Do you suppose I don't see the line you've taken up with your wife?",
  "4985": "You and he had searched for it together there, hadn't you?",
  "4986": "And now what is it that you came to me to say?",

  "5030": "And how about your luggage?",
  "5031": "You have, then, seen something?",
  "5032": "Would you like to come and see?",
  "5033": "How, then, was she to help herself among the proud and determined nobles of her court?",
  "5034": "Why can't the widow get back her silver snuffbox that was stole?",
  "5035": "So, then?",

  "5661": "How did this come about?",
  "5662": "What do I know about arms or supports?",
  "5663": "What does she make a sham for, and pretend to give me money, and take it away again?",
  "5664": "And was this conference arranged beforehand?",
  "5665": "Wherefore should I hold, good fellow?",
  "5666": "What have you done with your fur?",
  "5667": "Is not that true?",
  "5668": "And do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to her daughters, than to us?",
  "5669": "But why must I promise that?",
  "5670": "And what do you know?",
  "5671": "Will you have it so, or will you share your lover's punishment?",
  "5672": "And why on earth does she want to speak to me at all?",
  "5673": "What did you do it for?",
  "5674": "What can I do to serve you?",
  "5675": "What reason had you to strike the man who won my daughter?",
  "5676": "May it not be defined as a period of about twenty years in a woman's life, and thirty in a man's?",
  "5677": "What good is arguments to me?",
  "5678": "And who escapes his lot?",

  "5681": "Why is dawn red?",
  "5682": "What did he wish for?",

  "5684": "And is she not effectually degraded?",
  "5685": "Final for couples?",
  "5686": "They must be sold, I suppose?",
  "5687": "For what are these country squires compared to our wealthy merchants?",
  "5688": "But what shall I do?",
  "5689": "Who can tell what a dark, dreary, hopeless life I have dragged on for months past?",
  "5690": "What could be the trouble in that quarter?",
  "5691": "What does it matter, after all?",
  "5692": "What is the result of it?",
  "5693": "Did you hear that cry?",
  "5694": "Oh, don't you see?",
  "5695": "Did you ever see such a large peach in all your life?",
  "5696": "How much are you to give him?",
  "5697": "How many?",
  "5698": "Everything as it used to be?",
  "5699": "And how may that be?",
  "5700": "Are you comfortable?",
  "5701": "Can there be a rational adjustment of the claims of each?",
  "5702": "Father, that money is mine, why should I speak to you about that?",
  "5703": "Surely, sweet, it shall never be our dwelling?",
  "5704": "If he is it's not much good my coming, is it?",
  "5705": "Boys, an't this yer fun?",
  "5706": "Would those stiff trees that had outlived the eagle, turn young and airy pages to him, to skip on his errands when he bade them?",
  "5707": "What is their story?",
  "5708": "At what hour shall we come?",
  "5709": "Have you any tips to give us before we clear out?",
  "5710": "Which is the principal aim of these three?",
  "5711": "That's to you, I suppose, child?",
  "5712": "How must I arrange it, then?",
  "5713": "Is it really?",
  "5714": "Do you want any assistance?",
  "5715": "Yes, and is there a rope handy?",
  "5716": "Do you think it would be good for you?",
  "5717": "Suppose I handed you over to the police?",
  "5718": "And is the art of war one of those arts in which she can or can not share?",
  "5719": "And when did you arrive here?",
  "5720": "But how did he procure his books?",
  "5721": "You know her only son died eight years ago?",
  "5722": "How far do you purpose to extend your walk?",
  "5723": "At once?",
  "5724": "You do not like it, then?",
  "5725": "Shan't I disturb you?",
  "5726": "Non es eques, quare?",
  "5727": "Boys, ma'am?",
  "5728": "Wait a little, if you don't mind, and if you have time to spare?",
  "5729": "Has he asked you to give me the message?",
  "5730": "Some holy book, no doubt?",
  "5731": "Is it possible that one can forget and forsake what he once loved?",
  "5732": "Shall I put myself into the harness to be worn out like an old horse?",
  "5733": "You come from the contractor, you say?",
  "5734": "Why do you do it?",
  "5735": "Am I never to hear the last of this?",
  "5736": "You say that these thirteen millions are found to be wanting in the accounts?",
  "5737": "Then why not admit that these may be replaced some day by other moral intuitions to be evolved in an unknown future?",
  "5738": "What of yourself?",
  "5739": "Can't you now, doctor?",
  "5740": "Surely there must be someone among all of you here who will turn this shameless creature out of the room?",
  "5741": "What on earth is the use of time to a fellow who has twice as much of it as he knows what to do with?",
  "5742": "Or had he found something he wished to keep to himself?",
  "5743": "And how do these wiseacres know that man wants a normal, a virtuous choice?",
  "5744": "Why not furnish an unequivocal explanation of its object?",
  "5745": "Do you see that mainmast there?",
  "5746": "Any letters for me?",
  "5747": "Why are you so upset?",
  "5748": "Have you never felt the romance of that love?",
  "5749": "An explanation, pray, of what?",
  "5750": "And how on earth do they get at it?",
  "5751": "Do they get you bairns?",
  "5752": "Cannot one find friends among the animals, and choose some tame kid or eloquent parrot or amiable monkey?",
  "5753": "You wish to exchange crosses?",
  "5754": "Well, and did you like it very much?",
  "5755": "Would you mind describing him to me?",
  "5756": "But do you understand the mission you are fulfilling?",
  "5757": "What do YOU mean, mother?",
  "5758": "How about accidents?",
  "5759": "Do you think this is the end?",
  "5760": "Doing well, I suppose?",
  "5761": "Where 'bouts do you live?",
  "5762": "And then, mother?",
  "5763": "Do you sometimes think that I took an unfair advantage of your weakness?",
  "5764": "In what way did you mean it, sir?",
  "5765": "What did the gentleman say to her, my sonny?",
  "5766": "Did he name no one in his passion?",
  "5767": "What kind of political ambition was to result from this destructive political education?",
  "5768": "He knows them, then?",
  "5769": "Could narrow passages spread from it through the foundations of the island?",
  "5770": "Suppose we were to meet any of them?",
  "5771": "She wants to be admired, does she?",
  "5772": "Have you anything?",
  "5773": "And what is the cause of this?",
  "5774": "Or flatter sorry bunglers?",
  "5775": "By my orders?",
  "5776": "So you do not plead guilty?",
  "5777": "Now, are not you fancying, gentlemen, that I am expressing remorse for something now, that I am asking your forgiveness for something?",
  "5778": "Would a man grow weary of such a look turned on him, of such arms held out?",
  "5779": "Why does she give me notice when it's too late?",
  "5780": "I suppose they'll take her back, won't they?",
  "5781": "D'ye know anything of it?",
  "5782": "Why then do we not follow his example, doing as he did in the countries through which we pass?",
  "5783": "Cancel?",
  "5784": "And have you forgiven her for all she has made you suffer?",
  "5785": "Which of us is there can tell how much vanity lurks in our warmest regard for others, and how selfish our love is?",
  "5786": "Has the owner many ships?",
  "5787": "To a distance?",
  "5788": "This house?",
  "5789": "You think it would?",
  "5790": "Are you having a good time?",
  "5791": "Have you heard this?",
  "5792": "Why, where have you been?",
  "5793": "But now who will relieve me of the dread?",
  "5794": "Have the which?",
  "5795": "Why don't you snap your oars, you rascals?",
  "5796": "Is it not obvious?",
  "5797": "Why did you come to tell me yourself, instead of sending my man?",
  "5798": "Holidays?",
  "5799": "I mean did you see the statue fall?",
  "5800": "And she refused you as she says?",
  "5801": "Father went away to give us children room, didn't he?",
  "5802": "Durbeyfield?",
  "5803": "Can I see the letter?",
  "5804": "In what then, pray, shall I obey you?",
  "5805": "Why should you make a principle out of what you yourselves are, and must be?",
  "5806": "Why should we imagine that the precious metals are likely to do so?",
  "5807": "And what did he answer?",
  "5808": "What IS the matter?",
  "5809": "Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?",
  "5810": "What could he say to her now, after all he had said formerly, when he held her hands as he kissed her hair beside her cheeks?",
  "5811": "No female nurses?",
  "5812": "How did you happen to think of it?",
  "5813": "Where, then, is the power of your wealthy man?",
  "5814": "And what can I do but obey their commands?",
  "5815": "Would it, indeed, have been better if we had loved each other as a boy and a girl, and forgotten it?",
  "5816": "What social and political rights have women?",
  "5817": "And are they arrested?",
  "5818": "Puffs?",
  "5819": "Didn't they denounce the fenian movement from the pulpit and in the confession box?",
  "5820": "Isn't it time to skim it, my dear?",
  "5821": "Where do they come from, then?",
  "5822": "Marriage?",
  "5823": "Now, sir, why are you late again, as usual?",
  "5824": "Might anybody ask what their brother has been saying?",
  "5825": "Well, my children, what is going on now?",
  "5826": "What death?",
  "5827": "To what party did he belong?",
  "5828": "Does that suggest nothing to you?",
  "5829": "Where away?",
  "5830": "How did you penetrate hither?",
  "5831": "Caught cold in the grottos, at night, perhaps?",
  "5832": "You are sure?",
  "5833": "Well, and what did the last one say to ye?",
  "5834": "Did you come in the gig?",
  "5835": "And the DISENCHANTMENT of woman is in progress?",
  "5836": "Had your breakfast yet?",
  "5837": "Could he write something original?",
  "5838": "Breakfast?",
  "5839": "You are incredulous, are you?",
  "5840": "Now what does this imply?",
  "5841": "What possessed him to turn listener?",
  "5842": "Is this not a quite unusual politeness?",
  "5843": "Whatever have you done now?",
  "5844": "Are these things nothing?",
  "5845": "Did my sons get power and money?",
  "5846": "If they are such a happy class of people, how was it that you had such a time of punishing and hanging them within the last two years?",
  "5847": "And I have no doubt she loves you like a brother?",
  "5848": "And what have you been thinking about THEM, my busy bee?",
  "5849": "But how will it be?",
  "5850": "Could anything exceed the picture he gives one of scientific ardour?",
  "5851": "There is no exit that way?",
  "5852": "But was he worse?",
  "5853": "Yet how long before it was unsettled again?",
  "5854": "Philanthropy's sake?",
  "5855": "Or are they late because they have had a lovers' meeting?",
  "5856": "Is he very ill?",
  "5857": "Did he know them before?",
  "5858": "Cranly asked softly, happier than you are now, for instance?",
  "5859": "Why, what on earth does she do here?",
  "5860": "What does it matter to me whether the prince is to be what the late king was?",
  "5861": "Didn't I tell you now, mum, as it 'ud hurt your feelings to look at my pack?",
  "5862": "How can I urge my daughters now to go and raise large families?",
  "5863": "And what did it matter?",
  "5864": "What are you meddling with, stupid?",
  "5865": "Why do you specify the fox?",
  "5866": "Who said that?",
  "5867": "But you have found out something for yourself?",
  "5868": "Well, what if I could?",
  "5869": "Did you bet?",
  "5870": "Are you not weary of that stupid, meaningless, constantly repeated fraud?",
  "5871": "I say, you're not putting off a party tonight, are you?",
  "5872": "Were monuments to be reared to his honor, titles to be lavished upon his name?",
  "5873": "Well, then, what'll we make him the ink out of?",
  "5874": "But, bishop, the question is, who has the power to settle it?",
  "5875": "Don't you trust me?",
  "5876": "What does friendship mean if it not so?",
  "5877": "Well, what time for repayment do you wish me to take?",
  "5878": "Whuzzis?",
  "5879": "Why is the hawk so hated by birds?",
  "5880": "About measures, or rhythms, or verses?",
  "5881": "What sort of young woman?",
  "5882": "Do you know where I shall find him?",
  "5883": "I sprung out of bed, and asked, what wreck?",
  "5884": "Are you sure this time?",
  "5885": "Would he have drawn back?",
  "5886": "Had ever a queen such a throne before?",
  "5887": "And what do YOU want?",
  "5888": "Or was he a debtor or a debtor's son?",
  "5889": "Not quite so far, I hope?",
  "5890": "You are not angry with me?",
  "5891": "For what is maintenance?",
  "5892": "What will you?",
  "5893": "What does this mean?",
  "5894": "Go whither?",
  "5895": "Does he not set me at defiance?",
  "5896": "But, after the ball, why had he not returned?",
  "5897": "And where did you hear it?",
  "5898": "What the devil could that handkerchief signify?",
  "5899": "What data could he expect from an uncleaned watch?",
  "5900": "But what is all this about?",
  "5901": "How shall I redeem the consequences of my error?",
  "5902": "Can't we come?",
  "5903": "And destroy their lives, when they've helped me to remake mine?",
  "5904": "But need we fear anything beyond a momentary anger?",
  "5905": "And which are these two sorts?",
  "5906": "Does three hundred dollars lay around every day for people to pick up?",
  "5907": "Don't you feel as if you just loved the world on a morning like this?",
  "5908": "To drink?",
  "5909": "What shall we do, then, to push this great war of freedom and justice to its righteous conclusion?",
  "5910": "Will you get the mail, dear?",
  "5911": "Yes, very noble?",
  "5912": "Do you know where I am leading you?",
  "5913": "Did you never read in the papers the way murdered men do bleed and drip?",
  "5914": "Did we notify them of this sage view of ours when we borrowed their money?",
  "5915": "Why did you form a monster so hideous that even YOU turned from me in disgust?",

  "7586": "Why is there an allusion to that cursed 'poor knight' in the anonymous letter?",
  "7587": "Didn't he get the telegram?",
  "7588": "Don't you call to mind what he says?",
  "7589": "And what sort of young lady is she?",
  "7590": "Has a duplicate key been found in his possession?",
  "7591": "Didn't you feel the ground shake?",
  "7592": "How will you travel?",
  "7593": "How many did they say?",
  "7594": "You are not convinced yet?",
  "7595": "Have you provided yourself with money?",
  "7596": "I'm rather on the spot this evening, eh?",
  "7597": "Did she see you?",
  "7598": "Do people die of it?",
  "7599": "I suppose there is nothing to prevent it?",
  "7600": "Did not my neck glitter with diamonds?",
  "7601": "How comes it?",
  "7602": "How otherwise should I have been bad enough?",
  "7603": "You do not reply?",
  "7604": "Then would you call injustice malignity?",
  "7605": "Which will conquer?",
  "7606": "Well, what did the king say?",
  "7607": "Are you sure you're quite so much as six foot three?",
  "7608": "And why, may I ask?",
  "7609": "But we have grain belonging to my brother?",
  "7610": "Do ye love brandy?",
  "7611": "I've given you all the clothes you wanted, haven't I?",

  "7624": "And what sort of revenge would you take?",
  "7625": "Is it a time of war?",
  "7626": "I suppose that there has been no answer from my cabman advertisement?",
  "7627": "But what made you think the writing looked like that of the crazy machinist who tried to wreck the projectile?",
  "7628": "At this hour who would pass now?",
  "7629": "And what the devil do you wake me for?",
  "7630": "So you've got back?",
  "7631": "Then why don't you turn her out?",
  "7632": "Why should he go to a play if he enjoys it so little?",
  "7633": "Was it an angel's voice?",
  "7634": "Why, then, had he come hither?",
  "7635": "What was his version?",
  "7636": "Yet what good end can all this superficial counsel produce?",
  "7637": "What's the report of this boy?",
  "7638": "Take a glass of wine?",
  "7639": "And what has become of that scoundrel?",
  "7640": "But, what will you do?",
  "7641": "Are you coming down and fight fair?",
  "7642": "But what is the meaning of all this?",
  "7643": "Where be the dogs?",
  "7644": "Who is the master of the temple?",
  "7645": "And won't you come too?",
  "7646": "Well, what have I learned since?",
  "7647": "En didn't I bust up agin a lot er dem islands en have a turrible time en mos' git drownded?",
  "7648": "Would it bore you if I came in for a quarter of an hour?",

  "7650": "What can they mean?",
  "7651": "He has had punch already, has he not, sir?",
  "7652": "Shall you come down in the world for want of this letter about your son?",
  "7653": "So, then, you must leave us?",
  "7654": "But at any rate I have shown, have I not, that there is a certain element of improbability about the lady's story?",
  "7655": "And do you use this often?",
  "7656": "Has he got any?",
  "7657": "Are they friendly to us, do you think?",
  "7658": "Me alone?",
  "7659": "And you allow then, sir, that spheres exist, and that these marked and invisible beings mingle amongst us?",
  "7660": "Who knows if they will not manage to restore to me my pension?",
  "7661": "Poodle?",
  "7662": "Is she dead?",
  "7663": "But were you not on horseback?",
  "7664": "Is the countess up yet?",
  "7665": "Then this young man escaped with you?",
  "7666": "Where are my armies, my troops, my treasures?",
  "7667": "Canler?",
  "7668": "Do you belong to the number of the happy or of the miserable?",
  "7669": "But why couldn't he let me know?",
  "7670": "Will you promise to be quiet, and not kick up a fuss if I get you something to eat?",
  "7671": "And they not rich?",
  "7672": "In the rouge way?",
  "7673": "She did not resist, for what could she do?",

  "7682": "What if he turns against the others?",
  "7683": "For is not my lord the son of a king?",
  "7684": "Why is it so long?",
  "7685": "Will he even pay me for his lodging?",
  "7686": "A mistake?",
  "7687": "Shall any man hate me?",
  "7688": "Two figures?",
  "7689": "What will dart out presently?",
  "7690": "Does he regret me a little?",
  "7691": "How do you look at the question?",
  "7692": "You remember?",
  "7693": "Then why are there different faiths?",
  "7694": "What be they?",

  "7697": "There's her boots now, nice and decent for her evening use, and isn't it grand brushes she has?",
  "7698": "Is this your pupil?",
  "7699": "And what, pray, WAS the price?",
  "7700": "How is it with you?",
  "7701": "What o'clock is it?",
  "7702": "Surely the writer does not mean that a pleasant or delectable island would not be fit for breeding horses?",
  "7703": "You are a good temper?",
  "7704": "Had the crew seen me disappear?",
  "7705": "Don't you think we will?",
  "7706": "Now, do you understand me?",
  "7707": "How many times will I have to speak of this matter?",
  "7708": "On your arm?",
  "7709": "I understand, however, from the inquest that there were some objects which you failed to overlook?",
  "7710": "Why don't you go and get it then?",
  "7711": "Where are the graces of my soul?",
  "7712": "Do you know, sir, said she, that her ladyship intends to be down here with you in a few days?",
  "7713": "What is the meaning of this hunt, skipper?",
  "7714": "Why, had you no unicorn's horn, nor bezoar's stone about you, ha?",
  "7715": "Did you really think me capable of that?",
  "7716": "How do you like her, my dear?",
  "7717": "Shall I sure?",

  "7722": "Whose portraits are those?",
  "7723": "What was the subject of these singular conversations?",
  "7724": "Is it a check to the action of the individual?",
  "7725": "She is melancholy, then?",
  "7726": "Have you noticed THAT THEY WON'T LET ANY ONE TOUCH THEM?",
  "7727": "What sympathy should a holy preacher have with either?",
  "7728": "Is is a bargain?",
  "7729": "Would not your excellency like a little refreshment?",
  "7730": "So, then, they have paid my ransom?",
  "7731": "Well, mademoiselle, what are you thinking about, standing there like a statue?",
  "7732": "Will you undertake the task?",
  "7733": "Tell me, will you do this for me, and cease to weep?",
  "7734": "Come, how much?",
  "7735": "Do you know, sir, that you are asking me very strange questions, and that I am very foolish to answer them?",
  "7736": "Shall I climb the magnolia?",
  "7737": "What becomes of them?",
  "7738": "You aren't angry, are you?",
  "7739": "Eh, madame, who knows?",
  "7740": "The ghost?",
  "7741": "Then why hasn't she missed him before?",
  "7742": "Gwendolen, will you marry me?",
  "7743": "Wouldn't you like to know who I am, child?",
  "7744": "Will you not rest here?",
  "7745": "What were you thinking of?",
  "7746": "You let my mother alone, will you?",
  "7747": "But what are you going to do?",
  "7748": "What proof may there be that you can do your part in the compact?",
  "7749": "You won't go back?",

  "7751": "Then what?",
  "7752": "Do you mean to say you have had my cigarette case all this time?",
  "7753": "Won't you come along with me?",
  "7754": "What do we mean when we say that one man isn't to be trusted as another?",
  "7755": "What shall we do then?",
  "7756": "Jean, do you think that I am quite mad?",
  "7757": "Why is not her joy complete?",

  "7781": "But, pardon me, have you heard anything of that son?",
  "7782": "Is there any principle in these things?",
  "7783": "A convert to what?",
  "7784": "Who ever did?",
  "7785": "That is an important point, do you understand?",
  "7786": "And what do you mean by your look?",

  "7847": "And why should you take trouble?",
  "7848": "Or does he feel that he is sketching an inescapable human condition which makes all of us bear the burden of loneliness?",
  "7849": "You have not allowed him to penetrate your secret, then?",
  "7850": "You keep it on?",
  "7851": "Or are they digging side by side on different lines?",

  "7867": "What IN?",
  "7868": "Do you want to rob me, or to murder me?",
  "7869": "Do you care for me?",
  "7870": "Is it to be built on?",
  "7871": "Then must we resign ourselves to destruction?",
  "7872": "What wine please you have, sir?",
  "7873": "Why not start counting at a half of one?",
  "7874": "How dare you sit down in my presence?",
  "7875": "Well, but, leaving his land out of the question, do you like him?",

  "7891": "Why do you sing thus, and with such a voice?",
  "7892": "Does human nature thus change utterly and from top to bottom?",
  "7893": "Do you submit to this tamely, or are public feeling and the voice of heaven against you?",
  "7894": "It was not half handsome enough of course for the boy, but wasn't it noble of him to think of bringing it to his mother?",

  "8252": "Now what say you to a pasty, or a strip of beef cut where the juice runs, and maybe the half of a broiled fowl?",
  "8253": "Whether he could rush to the next assizes, and proclaim himself a lawyer?",
  "8254": "How can you ask me?",
  "8255": "And is the sum you bring me worth the trouble?",

  "8284": "Would any man weary of it, or wish to turn away his eyes?",
  "8285": "You're not much tired?",
  "8286": "What am I to say to him?",
  "8287": "What more can he do?",
  "8288": "But who can be angry at those assiduities which are meant to please him?",
  "8289": "Does that kind go smoothly?",

  "8314": "But what is to be done now?",
  "8315": "But how did you feel when you were loved by a servant?",
  "8316": "Dobbin?",
  "8317": "Will you set them fighting still further, or will you make peace between them?",
  "8318": "Do you suppose if there was any offence given me, I shouldn't name it, and request to have it corrected?",

  "10987": "Should he climb the other ridge, or wander along the hollow?",
  "10988": "You do not mean that they have sent him to prison?",
  "10989": "Why don't they come?",
  "10990": "How did he manage to buy this house?",
  "10991": "Was it a knell for his lost soul, chasing him through the empty streets and beginning already an eternal punishment of terror?",
  "10992": "What was he doing during that time?",
  "10993": "What is to be settled?",

  "11032": "Think it?",
  "11033": "What good is it?",
  "11034": "Is it you?",
  "11035": "You approve of my going away for years, then, and never coming here again till I have made myself of some mark in the world?",
  "11036": "They've conquered everybody, and why am I to be pleased at that?",
  "11037": "What's that you wouldn't tell, mother?",
  "11038": "In this emergency what are the contending parties doing?",
  "11039": "Must they devour each other?",
  "11040": "What do you say, mother?",
  "11041": "Is it wrong to watch the kingfisher seeking his nest?",
  "11042": "Where are you going to now?",
  "11043": "We're on the right track, I think?",
  "11044": "Is he, indeed?",
  "11045": "You would not inform?",
  "11046": "There is such a person, then?",
  "11047": "Who in this universe?",
  "11048": "Or who would with any patience hear his friends, if they should presume to defend his government as not arbitrary and tyrannical?",
  "11049": "Yes, don't you like this quarter?",
  "11050": "And you can't remember the number of the house?",
  "11051": "Once more, he said, what ruler is there of the elements of human nature other than the soul, and especially the wise soul?",

  "11061": "Mind, my darling?",
  "11062": "What part would they want me to take?",
  "11063": "And has your business been attended to in your absence?",
  "11064": "He's there, is he?",
  "11065": "I may use that freedom with your name?",
  "11066": "Chops, eh?",
  "11067": "Postponed for good, I hope?",

  "11084": "What does it mean?",
  "11085": "What could be the matter with the handsome fellow?",
  "11086": "Will that content you?",
  "11087": "What had caused it?",
  "11088": "Ay?",
  "11089": "Can I believe my ears?",

  "11097": "Who says so?",
  "11098": "How about your letters?",
  "11099": "Are you there?",
  "11100": "You mean that you want to get away from me, after I've been to all the trouble and expense of teaching you the business?",
  "11101": "Moreover, what is an obscure corner in such a submersion of joy?",
  "11102": "And who told you?",
  "11103": "What do we know about what she feels?",
  "11104": "Will he know from use whether or no his drawing is correct or beautiful?",

  "11208": "Well now, what is all this to the purpose, as things have turned about?",
  "11209": "Is that seemly?",
  "11210": "Would not one of the gentlemen be good enough to play or sing it?",
  "11211": "Do you think it would be worth while to open up somewhere else in the neighbourhood?",
  "11212": "But could not fasten?",
  "11213": "What are your sentiments?",
  "11214": "You impudent rascal, dare you say so to my face?",
  "11215": "Whither are you going?",

  "11241": "It has indeed been a feast of reason and flow of soul, hasn't it?",
  "11242": "Are you jesting with me?",
  "11243": "No notice?",
  "11244": "Then you are not going to demand any money of me?",
  "11245": "Have I no power for good, with you, at all?",
  "11246": "Are you ready, friends?",
  "11247": "Then, again, if not poison, what had caused the man's death, since there was neither wound nor marks of strangulation?",
  "11248": "Not my flight?",
  "11249": "What door?",
  "11250": "Can I have seen him abroad?",
  "11251": "Emmy, why didn't you have a bouquet?",
  "11252": "How deep is it?",
  "11253": "Why should this servant be so anxious to master this old formula?",
  "11254": "Whence the following wisdom?",
  "11255": "What was she thinking of doing?",
  "11256": "Besides, who knew that some foreign marksman might not pot the censor?",
  "11257": "Is it thus you reply to me?",
  "11258": "Will you take me to her?",
  "11259": "So novel?",
  "11260": "What you say here about virtue and justice and institutions and laws being the best things among men?",
  "11261": "They took this way?",
  "11262": "What does one want with dusty economic, books, which have made the world no better, or with mother's hideous chiffoniers?",
  "11263": "Then do they not love each other now?",
  "11264": "Shall I open it?",
  "11265": "Which dress am I to get ready?",
  "11266": "It would be an impertinence elsewhere, but it is not so here, to ask your name and condition?",
  "11267": "Does she go far?",
  "11268": "Besides, are we ever obliged?",
  "11269": "Why are you always puttering?",
  "11270": "Maisie, can't you see reason?",
  "11271": "What is the character of the addresses?",
  "11272": "That, then, is your opinion?",
  "11273": "Will you sell me a fish?",
  "11274": "Not dare to spit on it?",
  "11275": "Are you going to be my servant?",
  "11276": "What other name does she go by?",
  "11277": "What is its duty?",
  "11278": "But, peradventure, it may be sagaciously urged, how is this?",
  "11279": "And yet how many might I not have been guilty of?",
  "11280": "Do not I tell you she will be your sister?",
  "11281": "So he was not there?",
  "11282": "What are you thinking of, eh?",
  "11283": "However, did I find you out?",
  "11284": "Whither now would they goad him?",
  "11285": "But is the thing settled between you or not?",
  "11286": "So it does not please you to work?",
  "11287": "Your savings?",
  "11288": "If you do not return, how does it concern you?",
  "11289": "How much is a plate of peas?",
  "11290": "Would you like to come for a walk?",
  "11291": "Before?",
  "11292": "You won't take it from me?",
  "11293": "Would you not try to save her from suffering more even ifor would you?",
  "11294": "Why spoil such pleasant relations?",
  "11295": "Straker was brought back here, I presume?",
  "11296": "The only ones?",

  "11804": "How do you get at that?",
  "11805": "Frank?",
  "11806": "Are you strong enough?",
  "11807": "Now, I want to hear you swear that you are not married to that woman?",

  "11822": "Whom had we to deal with?",
  "11823": "Why don't you say you'd have a splendid, wise, good husband and some angelic little children?",
  "11824": "And yet there was one thing wanting in order to complete your happiness?",
  "11825": "I hope there's nothing wrong?",
  "11826": "Have the private emotions also their gutter press?",
  "11827": "Yes, but how came you here again?",
  "11828": "Do you think there is a single person in the county who will not know that his doing is a sign that he has quarrelled with me?",

  "12018": "Someone you were in love with?",
  "12019": "Were your positions in life so different?",
  "12020": "Still more pertinently, who was the moral woman?",
  "12021": "How fur is it?",
  "12022": "Well, but, my friend, is it not needful that I should?",
  "12023": "Is it what we feared?",
  "12024": "I mean, when you were growing up?",
  "12025": "His opinion of me is altered for the better, then?",

  "12039": "Why have you brought all that smelly leather stuff into the house?",
  "12040": "Enough, do you think, to loosen that honest tongue of yours?",
  "12041": "I says to myself, shall I go to that doctor, private, and blow on these frauds?",
  "12042": "What order can I take that will content ye?",
  "12043": "How did you get such broad broad feet?",
  "12044": "And who's this?",

  "14467": "And best give you, by the same token, yours to be magnificent with her?",
  "14468": "Who was that child?",
  "14469": "Who says this?",
  "14470": "May I speak of something serious to you, for once in my life?",
  "14471": "Do I ask in vain?",
  "14472": "And why is the life of a modest woman a perpetual conflict?",
  "14473": "Well, what are they?",
  "14474": "What can I do for you, sir?",
  "14475": "Then what compels me to wait two days?",
  "14476": "Can you form a judgment as to what distance we are likely to be carried?",
  "14477": "Would you like to see?",
  "14478": "You mean, no doubt, that you do not deny that might is right?",
  "14479": "What's the matter with me, anyhow?",
  "14480": "Do you want to have us killed one by one to diminish our force, and put us at the mercy of these wretches?",
  "14481": "Wasn't I honest with you?",
  "14482": "For where was life to be found?",
  "14483": "Will you be so good as to tell your mistress I am here?",
  "14484": "Or at the casement seen her stand?",
  "14485": "Do you mean to see me again?",
  "14486": "It seems a good deal, don't it?",
  "14487": "D'you mean to say you've had nothing but a bottle of milk for the last three days?",
  "14488": "Not if she gave up marrying?",
  "14489": "What makes you think so?",
  "14490": "Then where to seek a proper protector for you against the confusion and chances of such a scene?",
  "14491": "Would it be unreasonable if those who have endured and achieved so much had now come home to rest?",
  "14492": "Why, sir, didn't you order me to marry her, and ain't I a good boy?",
  "14493": "Was it possible that the child was dead and was made alive again?",
  "14494": "How squares that story with thy present plea?",
  "14495": "Haven't you any forged letters to produce?",
  "14496": "Do you know a fish called the pompano?",
  "14497": "Can I believe him?",
  "14498": "Whenever I hit upon a good epithet, I back my luck, don't you see?",
  "14499": "What shame, inglorious if I quit the plain?",
  "14500": "Did that letter thoroughly explain my position and my views?",
  "14501": "With your own eyes?",
  "14502": "What have you got in it?",
  "14503": "Is it not important to know the exact position of affairs?",
  "14504": "How long was he?",
  "14505": "Shall it be a hard or a soft nib?",
  "14506": "Will you believe me?",
  "14507": "And how does he think it may be guarded against?",
  "14508": "What do you think is on his mind?",
  "14509": "What sort of a man was this I had to do with, and what schemes was he now revolving in his fearless mind?",
  "14510": "For what, sir?",
  "14511": "Yet from whom has not that rude hand rent away some dear connection?",
  "14512": "Do you really wish the bairn to go?",
  "14513": "On what charge do you arrest me?",
  "14514": "Why have schools?",
  "14515": "What were you saying?",
  "14516": "When had he a letter before that?",
  "14517": "But could manage them?",
  "14518": "They surely couldn't stop away more than a week, could they now?",
  "14519": "Will you honor your dead?",
  "14520": "Their situation?",
  "14521": "Where are you going to be married?",
  "14522": "Is he doing all right?",
  "14523": "Who had a son, had she not?",
  "14524": "You resist, do you?",
  "14525": "Yes, nobody minds them, so lark away, but don't get wild, will you?",
  "14526": "What then, discreet dame, is it that your mistress wants?",
  "14527": "What does the horrible creature mean?",
  "14528": "But you know where it is?",
  "14529": "If it is useful to go so far, may it not be much more useful to go still farther?",
  "14530": "And whom did that bold hussy think she could persuade to believe that?",
  "14531": "It is not possible, is it, to see a more perfect representation of annihilation?",
  "14532": "What did you do, then?",
  "14533": "What is it all?",
  "14534": "You are fond of gardening?",
  "14535": "But what does that matter?",
  "14536": "Where are they hiding?",
  "14537": "You would not be inclined to say, would you, that navigation is the art of medicine, at least if we are to adopt your exact use of language?",
  "14538": "What would the dear man have?",
  "14539": "Why should we ignore it now?",
  "14540": "Ye flee from me?",
  "14541": "And didn't I hear your message?",
  "14542": "But what if he should suffer the radish through obeying you, and be depillated with hot ashes?",
  "14543": "But where is the compass?",
  "14544": "And if the influence went with him into the tent, whose was it?",
  "14545": "Aren't we going too much to the left?",
  "14546": "Have you got a bit of good net, now?",
  "14547": "That's it, hey?",
  "14548": "Falsehoods?",
  "14549": "But tell me, how do the peasants look at it?",
  "14550": "Have you caught good poems?",
  "14551": "What have you just been saying, my friend?",
  "14552": "Can you tell us where he is?",
  "14553": "What is there to keep them together?",
  "14554": "A what?",
  "14555": "Do you suppose I don't see how you are suffering, how this has torn open your wounds?",
  "14556": "Is it just that she shall leave and pay no part of this herself?",
  "14557": "Do you mean I've been your victim?",
  "14558": "Wrong?",
  "14559": "What's that sir?",
  "14560": "Or while I continue to work at my picture, which will certainly never get finished?",
  "14561": "She has some recent association with the number twelve?",
  "14562": "This wound?",
  "14563": "But not all of it?",
  "14564": "How on earth can I dress up like that?",
  "14565": "So, you did see him when he was talking to you at the table?",
  "14566": "Was ever such a sneaking varmint?",
  "14567": "Is he gentle, father?",
  "14568": "What am I to tell you?",
  "14569": "You do not eat?",
  "14570": "Isn't the whole course of life made up of such?",
  "14571": "He was allying himself to science, for it was science but the absence of prejudice backed by the presence of money?",
  "14572": "Does he think me a ghost?",
  "14573": "Did she know of any place in the neighbourhood where a servant was wanted?",
  "14574": "And very good ones too, I believe, haven't they?",
  "14575": "Passed?",
  "14576": "You surely do not fancy that you can set them free?",
  "14577": "Who can tell it?",
  "14578": "Why will you persist in hopeless obstinacy?",
  "14579": "What did she do at my house?",
  "14580": "And what were the two lines?",
  "14581": "What should we do with this projected surplus?",
  "14582": "And yours?",
  "14583": "Walker, what is it?",
  "14584": "What are you going to do with that?",
  "14585": "What should we have to do?",
  "14586": "Have you no more to add?",
  "14587": "Then have you perceived that you say nothing to the purpose?",
  "14588": "Ye tremble at this word?",
  "14589": "Why has she done nothing to set things right?",
  "14590": "Who informed you this was the master I propose to you?",
  "14591": "Have you mentioned this death in your paper?",
  "14592": "How else could we live did the outer world not furnish our labour and our food?",
  "14593": "What were they to do?",
  "14594": "Work?",
  "14595": "And suppose we don't get her out of the house?",
  "14596": "How can I help it, if power like to walk on crooked legs?",
  "14597": "Wasn't I right to part with the horses?",
  "14598": "But if in my adventure I encounter aright, as I hope I will, shall I be fortunate?",
  "14599": "Where would I go to?",
  "14600": "Kit's there, is he?",
  "14601": "In what particulars?",
  "14602": "And your master, where is he?",
  "14603": "What have I to do with politics?",
  "14604": "And how far is it from looking to being, my good geographer?",
  "14605": "Is it unusual, unsophisticated, primitive?",
  "14606": "Isn't that a romantic name?",
  "14607": "Might we ask why there has been all this secrecy?",
  "14608": "What, is he gone unto my mother?",
  "14609": "Thy means of feeding?",
  "14610": "Oh, that was what you were saying as I came in?",
  "14611": "When did I first begin?",
  "14612": "Woan't yaw, my lad?",
  "14613": "Why, how so?",
  "14614": "Her heart simple and wilful as a bird's heart?",
  "14615": "What might the gentleman's name be, sir, that sent it?",
  "14616": "And is it worth tormenting oneself, when one has only a moment of life in comparison with eternity?",
  "14617": "May not something be done for her instant relief?",
  "14618": "Why do you spoil him like this?",
  "14619": "Then what has happened?",
  "14620": "Who knows?",
  "14621": "How dare you?",
  "14622": "But you care for such things?",
  "14623": "Who could give you stouter help in return for your own support?",
  "14624": "What acquirement exalts one being above another?",
  "14625": "Who would care to live in such a region?",
  "14626": "And her address?",
  "14627": "How, then, could he have heard the bell?",
  "14628": "Were they plotting against me?",
  "14629": "And to the odd is opposed the even?",
  "14630": "But what are you going to do with the hay?",
  "14631": "He has not been moved at all?",
  "14632": "Why isn't there any one to look after you?",
  "14633": "In heredity?",
  "14634": "And what is a man that he should not run with his brothers?",
  "14635": "And you really mean to stay by till that day comes?",
  "14636": "And when did mother die?",
  "14637": "And why glorious, my young friend?",
  "14638": "Are you going to get such and such a hat?",
  "14639": "Why train technicians?",
  "14640": "Why should we linger here?",
  "14641": "Do you think he is the devil, that so many of us should be afraid of him?",
  "14642": "What did she know?",
  "14643": "His father had just been trampled under foot and stamped upon in his presence, but by whom?",
  "14644": "And what is he to do?",
  "14645": "How do you think his majesty is affected?",
  "14646": "What experience have you had?",
  "14647": "Have you a sponge in your room?",
  "14648": "How can I look my husband in the face after this?",
  "14649": "You are looking for my daughter?",
  "14650": "Well, how is he now?",
  "14651": "Do you not see how he is trembling now?",
  "14652": "Why is the chestnut on the right?",
  "14653": "What judgment is he entitled to pass upon contemporary reformers?",
  "14654": "My father's?",
  "14655": "Do you oftentimes find your mind contemplating the wonders of creation and the glories of salvation?",
  "14656": "Am I a nasty, cruel, selfish, bad mama?",
  "14657": "Are they very theatrical people here?",
  "14658": "How could they continue to cherish expectations that were invariably doomed to disappointment?",
  "14659": "Do you take an interest in this affair?",
  "14660": "Did I?",
  "14661": "Have mankind treated me as a brother?",
  "14662": "How old is the others?",
  "14663": "Why should I trouble myself?",
  "14664": "Well, but you saw him, didn't you?",
  "14665": "Those chickens?",
  "14666": "Shan't you be glad to come and see us?",
  "14667": "Does any one do wrong?",
  "14668": "But are you not measured, then, when you give an order?",
  "14669": "To what court of appeal can we refer the conflicts which may arise when ultimate authorities disagree?",
  "14670": "I asked them why they did not themselves remain in their old homes?",
  "14671": "Did you tell him?",
  "14672": "Is it an island?",
  "14673": "Who says this?",
  "14674": "So placed that YOU have to arrange?",
  "14675": "If, then, for a common object this property is to be sacrificed, is it not just that it be done at a common charge?",
  "14676": "Is the quarrel of MY making?",
  "14677": "Any bad habits?",
  "14678": "What I wanted to tell you?",
  "14679": "Are you sure you have a good driver?",
  "14680": "Will you believe?",
  "14681": "What has he done to you?",
  "14682": "You haven't worked against me?",
  "14683": "And the body is more like the changing?",
  "14684": "Is this it?",
  "14685": "Well, it's a pity to cut the pie if you're not hungry, isn't it?",
  "14686": "But how did she go through it?",
  "14687": "What is it that you fear?",
  "14688": "Whither will you lead me?",
  "14689": "But how many generations of the women who had gone to her making had descended bandaged to the family vault?",
  "14690": "What am I to say to her?",
  "14691": "Have you been sick?",
  "14692": "Is he untidy?",
  "14693": "So we meet again, my travelling friend, do we?",
  "14694": "You don't admit that a woman is a social being?",
  "14695": "You won't be angry, will you?",
  "14696": "What dim forms are those on the ladder?",
  "14697": "And he doesn't lie?",
  "14698": "And what did I thrust my address upon her for?",
  "14699": "And when are you coming to me?",
  "14700": "Is my flesh brass?",
  "14701": "So he wrote that you were to bring me a copy of his confession, did he?",
  "14702": "But why, in the greater society or confederacy of mankind, should not the case be the same as in particular clubs and companies?",
  "14703": "How can it be supposed that he should be the only rich man in his dominions who is insensible to pleasures of this kind ?",
  "14704": "Hain't we got all the fools in town on our side?",
  "14705": "Can any picture be more dreadful than that?",
  "14706": "Did I keep it?",
  "14707": "Absolute idiots then?",
  "14708": "My dear, do you know that you are forgetting yourself altogether?",
  "14709": "They're in column, aren't they?",
  "14710": "Where is divine action here?",
  "14711": "Could his own conscience ever forgive him if he deserted her?",
  "14712": "Why SHOULD I go there?",
  "14713": "It bores you to be like other men?",
  "14714": "And when do you expect this to happen?",
  "14715": "Had he lost his power of scenting out catastrophes?",
  "14716": "The mountains?",
  "14717": "Might she not have feared that her appearance would, after a while, have failed to content you?",
  "14718": "What names are masculine?",
  "14719": "How like you this first exploit of his?",
  "14720": "Why didn't you show it to me?",
  "14721": "How came the wheel off?",
  "14722": "How now, what says the notary?",
  "14723": "What are your questions?",
  "14724": "Do you think it mercy to save the bird?",
  "14725": "What would there be left for us if we had not that?",
  "14726": "What do you mean by poor knight?",
  "14727": "One?",
  "14728": "And this gentleman, being disengaged, takes to the service willingly?",
  "14729": "Why was I not born in those happy times?",
  "14730": "Madam, don't you perceive it?",
  "14731": "Do you think I'll sit at home here and take your 'too busys' and 'can't come,' while you parade around and make out that I'm unable to come?",
  "14732": "Who could hurt him more than he had been hurt already?",
  "14733": "Does she love the bad?",
  "14734": "How is he succeeding?",
  "14735": "Don't you see, papa, that I get weaker, every day?",
  "14736": "You have seen our managers WALK BACKWARD?",
  "14737": "What's wrong?",
  "14738": "Cos'e?",
  "14739": "Can you tell me where?",
  "14740": "Haven't you had enough exercise for one day?",
  "14741": "Victor, when falsehood can look so like the truth, who can assure themselves of certain happiness?",
  "14742": "And the composition?",
  "14743": "Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless?",
  "14744": "Is that which can bend and turn, and descend and ascend, to fit every crooked phase of selfish, worldly society, religion?",
  "14745": "You will at least accept my gratitude?",
  "14746": "What's the reward for putting it back in the bundle as it was before?",
  "14747": "Ye can, can ye?",
  "14748": "What was their beauty to me in a few weeks?",
  "14749": "What is it they're so pleased with?",
  "14750": "But what is pure?",
  "14751": "You have a clue?",
  "14752": "Where were we going, and what were we to do?",
  "14753": "Might his life, if not saved, be prolonged for some days?",
  "14754": "What are you talking about?",
  "14755": "And yet what law divine have I transgressed?",
  "14756": "Do you forgive your enemies, and depart hence at peace with yourself and with mankind?",
  "14757": "What government, district, and parish?",
  "14758": "We knew that an enormous amount of weight could be saved, but how much?",
  "14759": "Was this, then, the end of his six years of unflagging devotion?",
  "14760": "Well, sir?",
  "14761": "What do these things mean?",
  "14762": "Did she call?",
  "14763": "Nothing WHATEVER?",
  "14764": "Is it like?",
  "14765": "Can I have unintentionally wounded my best comrade?",
  "14766": "Whence did I get it?",
  "14767": "What could we do with any theory which should leave them out of consideration?",
  "14768": "Do you say no?",
  "14769": "What had become of the agent himself?",
  "14770": "What was he like then, as a wrestler?",
  "14771": "Can you not carry your meat and your liquor decently?",
  "14772": "Your aunt, sir?",
  "14773": "Won't it do you good?",
  "14774": "Are you a materialist?",
  "14775": "Are his hands loose?",
  "14776": "How old were you when you came upon him in the little churchyard?",
  "14777": "Why ain't you at work?",
  "14778": "Should not the actual possessor be preferred to the evicted possessor?",
  "14779": "What was that sound?",
  "14780": "Won't you now?",
  "14781": "Wasn't it so?",
  "14782": "Why has she been removed?",
  "14783": "Does he see a ghost, or hear an organ?",
  "14784": "Why, who's got it?",
  "14785": "But what has it to do with me?",
  "14786": "Have they advanced his fortune, enlarged his knowledge, or reformed his conduct, to the degree that was once expected?",
  "14787": "But have you told me all?",
  "14788": "What are you talking of?",
  "14789": "How do you know it?",
  "14790": "Didn't you see those four runaways cry at the sight of her?",
  "14791": "How's the patient?",
  "14792": "Is it possible for the human mind to conceive of a more horrible state of society?",
  "14793": "Still, what can we do?",
  "14794": "Have the police come?",
  "14795": "What are we waiting for?",
  "14796": "Is it all over?",
  "14797": "ARE you going to marry her or not?",
  "14798": "And can force, in default of reason, alone introduce them into our laws?",
  "14799": "Do you think he will die?",
  "14800": "Why should I not take his part?",
  "14801": "Make up for what?",
  "14802": "The procureur?",
  "14803": "Ah, yes, where is my sister?",
  "14804": "And you mean to say the little thing is very fascinating, I suppose?",
  "14805": "All of whom will call one another citizens?",
  "14806": "And was that how it all ended?",
  "14807": "Perhaps you had better let me pay up, or they'll think we've run away?",
  "14808": "Where is the necessity of this hallucination?",
  "14809": "Ain't it yours too, father?",
  "14810": "Why should YOU take it on yourself?",
  "14811": "Am I like her?",
  "14812": "Is he to be compelled to do so?",
  "14813": "Again?",
  "14814": "You don't mean the infant phenomenon?",
  "14815": "But who ever reflects that, for certain boys, an unjust imposition may be as great a pang as the death of a friend in later years?",
  "14816": "Spirit, are they yours?",
  "14817": "What difference is it to you?",
  "14818": "Would you have voted what you felt and knew to be a lie?",

  "14835": "My dearest girl, what is the matter?",
  "14836": "In what respect?",
  "14837": "Maylie?",
  "14838": "Why were the holy relics, the arms, ammunition, gunpowder, and stores of corn not removed?",

  "14851": "O, then, you are in love with him?",
  "14852": "What sort of a face was I to draw?",
  "14853": "Can you believe so?",
  "14854": "Who made this man my master?",
  "14855": "Why should he have pardoned me, then?",
  "14856": "That is so, is it not?",
  "14857": "How has he got rich?",
  "14858": "What more of the man she had told them of before?",
  "14859": "What can all this mean?",
  "14860": "Of what use would it be?",
  "14861": "It's natural and right for 'em to talk different from each other, ain't it?",
  "14862": "Is it not then strange that thy intelligent part only should be disobedient and discontented with its own place?",
  "14863": "Which are the best coasts?",
  "14864": "You wish to join the colony?",
  "14865": "Was it not his betrothal feast?",
  "14866": "Are you not the precious image of each and all of us men in this whaling world?",
  "14867": "It don't take long, does it?",
  "14868": "Will you always stand that way and wait, until it'll becomes morning, noon, and evening?",
  "14869": "Now, you will go, won't you?",
  "14870": "May I ask the reason of your refusal?",
  "14871": "Does he know where I am, aunt?",
  "14872": "Have you anything?",
  "14873": "What liquor?",
  "14874": "Eh, how can I tell?",
  "14875": "What would he think himself?",
  "14876": "Did he understand too well, or did he not understand at all?",
  "14877": "When will you stop such romping ways?",
  "14878": "Who has not?",
  "14879": "Don't you think that any secret course is an unworthy one?",
  "14880": "And what have you been bringing here?",
  "14881": "Are the others clever, sir?",
  "14882": "Why should he run wild upon the moor?",
  "14883": "What they DO doesn't alter the truth of what they say, does it?",
  "14884": "Is it because it is his duty to be grateful?",
  "14885": "Have you put him to any ransom?",
  "14886": "Charlotte?",
  "14887": "What do you make of them?",
  "14888": "Would you be asking me to break my oath?",
  "14889": "Is there nothing I can do?",
  "14890": "Why don't you go home, then, same's me?",
  "14891": "What was this strange house?",
  "14892": "Do you not go with us?",
  "14893": "Think we're as green as to do you in here, and have the police nosing round?",
  "14894": "Taken in by the servant?",
  "14895": "What will become of us?",
  "14896": "D'you understand?",
  "14897": "And these researches?",
  "14898": "Is it some former admirer who wishes to retire?",
  "14899": "And you fancy that the two matters are connected in some way?",
  "14900": "You'll come with me, won't you?",
  "14901": "Your father, or brother, or your betrothed?",
  "14902": "When do you go, sir?",
  "14903": "What if the boy were really not her son, after all?",
  "14904": "Who are you, pray ?",
  "14905": "Well, granting that, what became of him?",
  "14906": "What put that idea in your head?",
  "14907": "Why did you not put your name to the note?",
  "14908": "He has been fairly in?",
  "14909": "Could you get me a part if I paid?",
  "14910": "What is the time now?",
  "14911": "Where do you go?",
  "14912": "Which lady?",
  "14913": "Oh, will you really?",
  "14914": "Who is the gentleman with the telescope?",
  "14915": "Why, indeed?",
  "14916": "That is his meaning then?",
  "14917": "And 'What will you take for the geese?",
  "14918": "Promise not to repeat?",
  "14919": "Are ye tuck sick, or what's come over ye?",
  "14920": "Tell me, why does a steward rob his master?",
  "14921": "Have you no regard for true merit, you malignant fellow?",
  "14922": "And last night he was with us so happy, so cheerful, so affectionate?",
  "14923": "It is not all a question of goods?",
  "14924": "Therefore is my freedom lawful, however proper it may be?",
  "14925": "Were they swept into eternity by a freshet?",
  "14926": "Besides, where was I to find a person to write the words, and one who would give himself the trouble of turning the poetry to my liking?",
  "14927": "Is it in any way different from other schools?",
  "14928": "And what harm if he did talk?",
  "14929": "Us, who have wings and fly?",
  "14930": "A grey mare?",
  "14931": "What effect had this frightful shock produced?",
  "14932": "And he acquiesced?",
  "14933": "So you would advise a knife to his throat?",
  "14934": "How dare you touch that coronet?",
  "14935": "Can't you make it eight?",
  "14936": "What has been decided?",
  "14937": "My dear girl, what have I got to do with her dressing beautifully or looking well?",
  "14938": "Are you speaking seriously, doctor?",
  "14939": "How could that be?",
  "14940": "My companions and myself?",
  "14941": "Do we breakfast or dine?",
  "14942": "Ought any, then, to refuse their aid in doing what good the good of the whole demands?",
  "14943": "Would the stranger one day speak of it?",
  "14944": "What may my father wish to convey?",
  "14945": "At the rate of, sir?",
  "14946": "When did you say he died?",
  "14947": "Well, when is her birthday?",
  "14948": "Is there any political power to authorize such interference?",
  "14949": "Now do you understand?",
  "14950": "And it was she, I presume, who mentioned your name?",
  "14951": "Is that where you live, my little lady?",
  "14952": "Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it?",
  "14953": "Where d' you live, sir?",
  "14954": "Are you come out as against a thief, with swords and staves to take me?",
  "14955": "Do you repent?",
  "14956": "Is the water always turbid?",
  "14957": "Was there nothing to be done?",
  "14958": "Say ye so?",
  "14959": "Well, what is it you really want of me?",
  "14960": "Who shall be the judge of merit?",
  "14961": "How now, nephew?",
  "14962": "Have I forgot my noble birth?",
  "14963": "Well, what shall you do with this money, count?",
  "14964": "Well, what are the names of the patriarchs?",
  "14965": "Have I clearly explained the class which I mean?",
  "14966": "Where can he have been hidden?",
  "14967": "Where did you bring him from?",
  "14968": "How can your lordship imagine that you could ever inconvenience me?",
  "14969": "How did you come here?",
  "14970": "I suppose he never knew me?",
  "14971": "Why did you drive me to such extremities?",
  "14972": "But why should such an idea cross your mind?",
  "14973": "A hundred and twenty talents?",
  "14974": "You couldn't take me, could you?",
  "14975": "But how are we to come by the men?",
  "14976": "What can I fear while shielded by protection at once so loving and so powerful?",
  "14977": "When was I in a fearful state?",
  "14978": "Shall I commit adultery?",
  "14979": "What has become of him?",
  "14980": "In that case, monseigneur, do you believe the cardinal will be so kind as to tell me what has become of my wife?",
  "14981": "Can he be sure that the two are necessarily in accord?",
  "14982": "Was there no mention made of me in the letter?",
  "14983": "Are not these beggarly devils sufficiently wretched already?",
  "14984": "Were you ever at sea, before?",
  "14985": "But what did you mean to take?",
  "14986": "Have strangers leave with us to get their wealth?",
  "14987": "If she bleeds to death, is that my fault?",
  "14988": "You are going to leave us after I have become so accustomed to you?",
  "14989": "Can it be done?",
  "14990": "Is she your child?",
  "14991": "What if by endeavouring to place her in the position of a lady, he had falsely so placed her, and robbed her of her legitimate position?",
  "14992": "Am I come to a friend?",
  "14993": "What befals him dead?",
  "14994": "Which way heading?",
  "14995": "Then what shall I gain, pray?",
  "14996": "How do you suppose you can carry on like this?",
  "14997": "Whose service would that be?",
  "14998": "What does all this flight of imagination mean?",
  "14999": "Vansuythen?",
  "15000": "What in the world do you s'pose that is?",
  "15001": "Is our little neighbor worse?",
  "15002": "Where have I been brought to?",
  "15003": "Nor the blue bed?",
  "15004": "My good sir, what is the matter with you, O father?",
  "15005": "How long will it be first?",
  "15006": "Why has she given up sending the children and coming to see us?",
  "15007": "Who is this?",
  "15008": "Is dat you, honey?",
  "15009": "Garth?",
  "15010": "Where do your brothers and sisters live?",
  "15011": "How can I take this stranger into my house?",
  "15012": "Then don't you know how it was?",
  "15013": "What did you do such a crazy thing as that for?",
  "15014": "Who is it you wish to see?",
  "15015": "Why is it that she speaks to him of about your welfare and your position, as she clearly has done?",
  "15016": "How will that do?",
  "15017": "But why shall I say more?",
  "15018": "I wonder if you will forgive me?",
  "15019": "But with what object?",
  "15020": "Where is the girl?",
  "15021": "You, too, booted and spurred?",
  "15022": "You imagined I didn't know you had your watch again?",
  "15023": "And what kind of woman, and of what age is she?",
  "15024": "Prunes?",
  "15025": "How came you to be there?",
  "15026": "And where might it be now?",
  "15027": "Now, how on earth could you know that the stolen silver was at the bottom of that pond?",
  "15028": "There are no villages here?",
  "15029": "What at?",
  "15030": "Something that you would like done, is it not?",
  "15031": "Was that all?",
  "15032": "Will you not let me look at it also?",
  "15033": "And are things in order?",
  "15034": "How about the fireplace?",
  "15035": "Why, what is the matter?",
  "15036": "And what did you say?",
  "15037": "Who is right and who is wrong?",
  "15038": "But if a man had a danger hanging over him, and knew what it was, don't you think he would turn to the police for protection?",
  "15039": "How did it show itself?",
  "15040": "When is this accomplished?",
  "15041": "And have you them yet?",
  "15042": "Did I take this yesterday?",
  "15043": "Will any private training enable him to stand firm against the overwhelming flood of popular opinion?",
  "15044": "Why would ye let such beauty wither?",
  "15045": "What may YOUR game be, ma'am?",
  "15046": "But what does it show?",
  "15047": "Or hear, except with the ear?",
  "15048": "Was it for this I condescended to take you to my bed, you poor, withered, sapless twig?",
  "15049": "What is the wind?",
  "15050": "It wasn't your fault so why should you mind?",
  "15051": "What must I answer?",
  "15052": "Is there any talk yet of who is to run?",
  "15053": "Must it be so?",
  "15054": "But what can we do?",
  "15055": "Why did you push yourself in there by daylight?",
  "15056": "And does not marriage mean motherhood?",
  "15057": "Don't you belong to the barricade?",
  "15058": "And what do you suppose the master will think when I display it before him?",
  "15059": "Hand over, will you?",
  "15060": "And think there was to you no conscience of the housebreaker, what would you do?",
  "15061": "What is it that you will not do?",
  "15062": "And whither go we, my father?",
  "15063": "What vault?",
  "15064": "By asking advice instead of exerting the judgment?",
  "15065": "Another one, eh?",
  "15066": "Who are they that carry it?",
  "15067": "For what can be the meaning of a truly wise man wanting to fly away and lightly leave a master who is better than himself?",
  "15068": "You think, probably, that I roam around, and get into all sorts of evil?",
  "15069": "Why weren't you at the races yesterday?",
  "15070": "But fly whither?",
  "15071": "May it be that I see you?",
  "15072": "Yes, count, you know what I told you?",
  "15073": "And what kind of a man?",
  "15074": "What have you killed a man for, you thief?",
  "15075": "Have you heard what has happened?",
  "15076": "Does the king exile me?",
  "15077": "And who is that pale young man beside him?",
  "15078": "Yes, isn't it, dear?",
  "15079": "What more need be said?",
  "15080": "Will no danger threaten him?",
  "15081": "How can you reconcile it to your conscience, I wonder, to prejudice my own boy against me, or against anybody who is dear to me?",
  "15082": "Nor of any other such person?",
  "15083": "Will your excellency deign to open it?",
  "15084": "Who amongst us is there that does not recollect similar hours of bitter, bitter childish grief?",
  "15085": "How could she be enamoured at once of nobleness and baseness, or at once desire and not desire one deed and the same?",
  "15086": "What had he really gained by all this trouble?",
  "15087": "And what was his reply?",
  "15088": "Shall I row you ashore?",
  "15089": "Have I been talking in my sleep?",
  "15090": "Where now?",
  "15091": "Who has not, a hundred times, found himself committing a vile or a silly action, for no other reason than because he knows he should not?",
  "15092": "The beginning or the end?",
  "15093": "Indeed, where could we stop?",
  "15094": "Wasn't it a lovely place?",
  "15095": "He is dead, is he not?",
  "15096": "The name of my clerk?",
  "15097": "Will you call for the money, or shall I send it?",
  "15098": "But how to get rid of him?",
  "15099": "Who's going?",
  "15100": "How is the queen?",
  "15101": "So you refuse my request?",
  "15102": "You wonder what?",
  "15103": "And who is that other person?",
  "15104": "Rheumatism, sir?",
  "15105": "Am I my brother's keeper?",
  "15106": "What do you mean by early?",
  "15107": "Would they be likely to get rid of seven men out of eight from their own gang and retain only the eighth man?",
  "15108": "You will go to the city and make money, eh?",
  "15109": "Do you think he had planned this robbery, when he went with you to the lodging?",
  "15110": "O, is your bundle ready?",
  "15111": "Real friends?",
  "15112": "Will you never get on to your job?",
  "15113": "And about what?",
  "15114": "You owe her her wages, I suppose?",
  "15115": "Do you know what you have said?",
  "15116": "Balderstone?",
  "15117": "I am having a room got ready for you here, and will you please come round at once on getting this?",
  "15118": "But we owe something in this house?",
  "15119": "And what about afterwards?",
  "15120": "But where will we be tomorrow?",
  "15121": "What advice?",
  "15122": "Who told her?",
  "15123": "Remarkable for what?",
  "15124": "Is it not what happens to every one?",
  "15125": "But how is it she does not think of it herself?",
  "15126": "Who may it be for?",
  "15127": "I say, laddie, you don't object if I sing slightly from time to time during the journey?",
  "15128": "What makes you weep, mama?",
  "15129": "Where is his office?",
  "15130": "What do you mean by that question?",
  "15131": "If this is the great evil of being alone, then what is good and what is evil?",
  "15132": "Have you any arms?",
  "15133": "Are they in possession of our letters?",
  "15134": "Do you observe this gallery, or rather lobby, indeed?",
  "15135": "When will you do that?",
  "15136": "And will not the words and the character of the style depend on the temper of the soul?",
  "15137": "Do you not think that it would be regrettable if we had met in vain?",
  "15138": "Why did she come?",
  "15139": "Is it not safe e'en to encounter him?",
  "15140": "Did any haberdasher ever look so smirking?",
  "15141": "But what degree of intensity will overbalance what period of duration?",
  "15142": "Couldn't we enlarge it, hollow it out, make openings to let in light and air?",
  "15143": "How can I desire children?",
  "15144": "Would I only come and look at the range?",
  "15145": "What is the prisoner's name?",
  "15146": "Well, hasn't it made it exactly what we wanted?",
  "15147": "How can there be any secrecy, when everything is known to all of us?",
  "15148": "You won't carry me off in your bags, will ye, master?",
  "15149": "Where is your master's diocese?",
  "15150": "Why did he so?",
  "15151": "What was it, my own mother?",
  "15152": "But when you held her in your power, why did you not drown her, strangle her, hang her?",
  "15153": "But by whom will Z be paid for the loss caused him by the profit charged by A in the beginning?",
  "15154": "Perhaps, sir, you don't like the ship?",
  "15155": "Do you think I'd let him imagine for a minute that anything he said could influence me in my public duty?",
  "15156": "Is she safe?",
  "15157": "Have I offended you?",
  "15158": "Then you are on guard every day?",
  "15159": "But this castle, then?",
  "15160": "You know him, then?",
  "15161": "What, said he, I wonder, will the good old couple say to it?",
  "15162": "My hand?",
  "15163": "You consider it, then, perfectly unworthy of a woman to love a man who does not adore her?",
  "15164": "Why are you upset?",
  "15165": "Have you anything to ask of me?",
  "15166": "I've accepted your dismissal, and you managed it as cruelly as you could, and I have made you respect my sex, haven't I?",
  "15167": "What must I do?",
  "15168": "You have formed some conclusion?",
  "15169": "Was not the observation of the chief only what might have been expected?",
  "15170": "What right have I to betray the confidence reposed in me, when nothing but a miracle can prevent this sacrifice?",
  "15171": "But how many passions have amalgamated to form that hatred?",
  "15172": "Can't you be generous and unselfish enough to face whatever trial there may be for you in this bit of a coincidence?",
  "15173": "How did she come there?",
  "15174": "Now, don't you think the lad would be handsomer cropped?",
  "15175": "Who could have told that such a hurricane had been let loose on the surface of that ocean?",
  "15176": "Are you tired?",
  "15177": "What is the result at present?",
  "15178": "Were you never taught to say your prayers?",
  "15179": "Well, said he, who next?",
  "15180": "Is it suppression?",
  "15181": "Then they will quarrel as those who intend some day to be reconciled?",
  "15182": "Where is the pain?",
  "15183": "Why did you take the axe along?",
  "15184": "How was it done?",
  "15185": "And why are you all alone?",
  "15186": "The scene which followed, who can describe?",
  "15187": "Where would you have been, my dear, if I hadn't meddled with YOU?",
  "15188": "Where does he expect me to get it?",
  "15189": "Did you call, sir?",
  "15190": "Where, then, is your enthusiasm?",
  "15191": "Do you wish it?",
  "15192": "Do you really think so, doctor?",
  "15193": "Oh, is that all?",
  "15194": "Is the point of my mantle in the middle, and have I looped my dress evenly?",
  "15195": "Fifty dollars?",
  "15196": "Why, are you afraid of those fowls?",
  "15197": "What, do you not know your house?",
  "15198": "And on what day did he meet his death?",
  "15199": "What did THEY know about countesses?",
  "15200": "What's that?",
  "15201": "Very well, is she?",
  "15202": "Why does tha' care so much about roses an' such, all of a sudden?",
  "15203": "What will he say when he returns?",
  "15204": "But you changed your mind?",
  "15205": "Could they be assembled in arms, who would dare to assume the office of general?",
  "15206": "Does any one know with whom?",
  "15207": "Now, do you not call that base?",
  "15208": "You think that's a condemnation?",
  "15209": "What have you found?",
  "15210": "And just on this line between the setting and rising sun?",
  "15211": "What was the matter with her, what could be going on, to affect any one like that?",
  "15212": "How had he got there?",
  "15213": "Any fresh face would cause comment?",
  "15214": "Fetch me a cup of coffee, will you?",
  "15215": "What greater gift can man receive than fame, praise and immortality?",
  "15216": "What would he do to her?",
  "15217": "At what time would you like something to eat?",
  "15218": "Where is this man?",
  "15219": "Who would I prefer for mistress of the ceremonies?",
  "15220": "Why did you say that, dear?",
  "15221": "What the hammer?",
  "15222": "Eke at the feast who might her body save?",
  "15223": "Why do you bring them to me?",
  "15224": "You plume yourself on being a wag?",
  "15225": "And how is our dear invalid?",
  "15226": "If you love books, to what place are books so suitable?",
  "15227": "How can this youth ever learn an acquittal from a trial or a legal summons, or persuasive refutation?",
  "15228": "Do you dare to brave me?",
  "15229": "Are you in your senses?",
  "15230": "Is it worth giving them half a hopper full?",
  "15231": "And will you sign the contract?",
  "15232": "What put it into your head?",
  "15233": "Only you?",
  "15234": "Where's my little girl?",
  "15235": "Am I a liar in your eyes?",
  "15236": "Now, why have you kept this lad?",
  "15237": "What warrior was there, however famous and skilful, that could fight at odds with him?",
  "15238": "Ain't I a man?",
  "15239": "You envy him for not being able to fall in love?",
  "15240": "You received then nothing at all?",
  "15241": "Aren't I a good brother to you?",
  "15242": "Bed, sir?",
  "15243": "How are you now?",
  "15244": "Yet to which of these so pointingly, as he might not either ingenuously have confest, or wisely dissembled his disease?",
  "15245": "Is it a donkey?",
  "15246": "Is the show going all right?",
  "15247": "I am sure you will do that, will you not?",
  "15248": "Set off?",
  "15249": "Would you like some tea?",
  "15250": "And can any one of those many things which are called by particular names be said to be this rather than not to be this?",
  "15251": "So you like it, you rogue?",
  "15252": "How was her face?",

  "21234": "What may that be?",
  "21235": "You consent then?",
  "21236": "It is a man, then, who expects you?",
  "21237": "And would it not be foolish to mourn a calamity above twenty years beforehand?",

  "21403": "Oh, where was he?",
  "21404": "If I might make a suggestion, sir?",
  "21405": "What decision?",

  "21411": "What is the difficulty?",
  "21412": "How could you shut me out, bear it all alone?",
  "21413": "Would it be an indiscretion to ask to see those precious pills?",
  "21414": "And who is the cause of all this annoyance?",
  "21415": "After this, what more can be wanted?",
  "21416": "Tame?",
  "21417": "Will you take these mementos to him?",
  "21418": "And WHERE has he gone?",
  "21419": "But what is the point of it?",
  "21420": "And what good is it to the bubble while it holds together, or what harm when it is burst?",
  "21421": "What are you going to do with yourselves after you get settled?",
  "21422": "Is that it, my dear?",
  "21423": "If one is not to get into a rage sometimes, what is the good of being friends?",

  "21454": "We are not wrong therefore in calling them necessary?",
  "21455": "Gentlemen, did you ever see a scorpion pinned to a wall?",
  "21456": "But what about the lamps?",
  "21457": "But then?",
  "21458": "Isn't it right?",
  "21459": "And me, too?",

  "21461": "A surprise?",
  "21462": "Why cannot we launch into space through the scuttle?",
  "21463": "Is that what you wish for?",
  "21464": "Die for it?",
  "21465": "They must have been mistaken, surely?",
  "21466": "Absolutely?",

  "21557": "Shall I have my son a stager now?",
  "21558": "Whither did he go?",

  "25737": "How could I be so cruel to you?",
  "25738": "It is my marriage you mean, is it not, dear grandpapa?",
  "25739": "But tell me, and tell me true, in what way did you die?",
  "25740": "How can one think with one's head all fuzzy?",
  "25741": "How can you expect that I shall continue to love you, when I see you maintain, when I hear you swear to me a thing which I know to be false?",
  "25742": "What can it mean, this relentless persecution?",
  "25743": "Have you forgotten your soul, your spirit, your man's energy, the treasure of your heart?",
  "25744": "WHY so pale and wan, fond lover?",
  "25745": "Two in the morning, or two in the afternoon?",

  "25756": "What was the object of the second man?",
  "25757": "Do you think I can stay to become nothing to you?",
  "25758": "Shall I have a barricado made against my friends, to be barr'd of any pleasure they can bring in to me with their honourable visitation?",
  "25759": "What I want to know is, where I ought to rank myself?",
  "25760": "Will you take a gold piece?",
  "25761": "Was it but the mockery of penitence?",
  "25762": "Are they?",

  "25764": "Of course you love him dearly?",
  "25765": "What was the thickness of this wall?",
  "25766": "What pen can describe it?",
  "25767": "Is controlling it as other property the same thing as destroying it, or driving it away?",
  "25768": "What is that, my love?",
  "25769": "Was there no one with you?",
  "25770": "Can you tell us what to do?",
  "25771": "To whom?",
  "25772": "When a good man sticks his bayonet through another good man, father of a family, or, perhaps, a great artist, what idea is he following out?",
  "25773": "Was not I an idiot?",
  "25774": "Ah, it was you, sir?",

  "25781": "How did you guess?",
  "25782": "But how can the news be brought to you?",
  "25783": "Could they have fallen into the sea?",
  "25784": "The visible heavens and earth, the whole system of the universe, which may be conceived by the mind, is it created or eternal?",
  "25785": "But where is the other?",
  "25786": "What's the matter with me, anyhow?",
  "25787": "Are you set on the death of that spy?",
  "25788": "Does his mother not know this?",
  "25789": "Then you noticed it too?",
  "25790": "I am right, am I not?",
  "25791": "Why did she take it into her head to die at that moment?",
  "25792": "Saw you ever the like?",
  "25793": "And who am I, to nourish such ambition?",
  "25794": "You are surprised at what you see here?",
  "25795": "Do you hear the laughing and his voice?",
  "25796": "Shall I bear false witness?",
  "25797": "Is he not reviving slowly?",
  "25798": "What's afoot now, young un?",
  "25799": "What sort of a place was it, and what would he be like?",
  "25800": "Had any of them made such a hash of life as he?",
  "25801": "Who's the other cup for?",
  "25802": "Is there more?",
  "25803": "What paper was that?",
  "25804": "And when you know, will you tell me?",
  "25805": "How long would it take for a telegram to reach him?",
  "25806": "Isn't it a dog, sir?",
  "25807": "Do you wish to make good your boasted prowess?",
  "25808": "Is it not, therefore, clear, that in marrying him, you would descend to a rank below you own?",
  "25809": "How should I forget ?",
  "25810": "What boot these wonders?",
  "25811": "And who says so?",
  "25812": "How long have you been engaged?",
  "25813": "What they read in the church?",
  "25814": "You look dumbfoundered?",
  "25815": "If this sailor had escaped the perils of the shipwreck, why should not the captain?",
  "25816": "Oh, how can I live?",
  "25817": "I suppose you can transform us into beasts as well as birds?",
  "25818": "How is it one never sees you?",
  "25819": "Where've you been?",
  "25820": "Now say if I conceal anything from you?",

  "25824": "How is it you are so late?",
  "25825": "You have kept a diary of all these so strange things, is it not so?",
  "25826": "But your companions?",
  "25827": "I trust that there is nothing of consequence which I have overlooked?",
  "25828": "Is it for my own sake?",
  "25829": "Well, what are you going to do?",
  "25830": "Don't you see her there away from you?",
  "25831": "And is there nothing on the way?",
  "25832": "Gentlemen, please you change a few crowns for a very excellent blade here?",
  "25833": "What, now, is the significance of this appeal from ANALYSIS to the false judgments of the synthesis?",
  "25834": "Is not that it?",
  "25835": "Forgive you?",
  "25836": "What association?",
  "25837": "But where are these persons, then?",

  "25839": "Where shall we lie in wait?",
  "25840": "And by what gate did they go out?",
  "25841": "From whom can come so many disgraces heaped upon her head, if not from him?",
  "25842": "Who invited you?",
  "25843": "Making love in play, eh?",
  "25844": "How, then, could his father's heart remain void, and closed to its influence?",
  "25845": "Have you heard the story?",
  "25846": "Would you really give us the money?",
  "25847": "But what other internal attributes of such an object can I think than those which my internal sense presents to me?",
  "25848": "Any children?",
  "25849": "How is it distant?",
  "25850": "Which box do you mean?",
  "25851": "How can a system of education flourish that begins by so monstrous a falsehood, which the sense of hearing suffices to contradict?",
  "25852": "Do you know anything about him?",
  "25853": "What are you talking about, then?",
  "25854": "Is it a long drive to the church?",
  "25855": "Diggory?",

  "25860": "A present?",
  "25861": "Do you hear me when I tell you that, my darling?",
  "25862": "And when you can do better, you will?",
  "25863": "And does he catch plenty of fish?",
  "25864": "Did you ever stop to think of all the love letters that have been found after death?",
  "25865": "Why do you say that?",
  "25866": "What could she have to conceal from me whose happiness she knew principally consisted in that of herself and her daughter?",
  "25867": "You wouldn't care to go on board for the next trip, and have tea there?",
  "25868": "Do you expect news from him?",
  "25869": "Will you trust me?",
  "25870": "On what authority, then, do you venture to attack universal consent, and give the lie to the human race?",
  "25871": "Say, is it thus those honours you requite?",
  "25872": "Where is he who called me?",
  "25873": "May I not come near you?",

  "25884": "Har you a goin' to pay me?",
  "25885": "What nonsense?",
  "25886": "Have you not said that that abduction was entirely political?",
  "25887": "But what is the difference?",
  "25888": "Is that a friar passing?",
  "25889": "Why did you not listen to the counsels of your confessor?",
  "25890": "Is he quite well?",
  "25891": "Did he himself quite know what he meant?",
  "25892": "Do you suppose it does not give me pain to hear you thus spoken of with scorn?",
  "25893": "Well, don't you intend to bring me another plate?",

  "25934": "Do you consent to the terms, and will you take the money?",
  "25935": "How does it begin?",
  "25936": "I say, what's to prevent our employing this worthy woman, your mother?",
  "25937": "What is more peaceful than the calm, even flowing of a river?",

  "27574": "Why, then, suppose now an inertia which definitions contradict, now an external potentiality which nothing proves?",
  "27575": "Whence does she come?",
  "27576": "Well, but what ought to be the criterion?",
  "27577": "You won't be longer than a week at the outside?",
  "27578": "Then, darling papa?",
  "27579": "Or rather was it a boat from the frigate, that was hailing us in the darkness?",
  "27580": "Is this the language of a rational man?",
  "27581": "Well, and how did the ring come into your possession?",
  "27582": "What should I have done as soon as I was hard and fast here?",
  "27583": "Why had not you as good do it?",
  "27584": "Am I going, or not, to my ruin?",
  "27585": "And who is ever silly enough to complain of it?",
  "27586": "But what sort of a way is that for bones to lie?",
  "27587": "What CAN all that green stuff be?",
  "27588": "Do you recognize your quondam pupil, professor?",
  "27589": "I require to be let alone?",
  "27590": "Is it not by chance that the unfortunate child was disinterred under the trees?",
  "27591": "Can he even see the feature?",
  "27592": "Well, why have I worried him, for five years, and never let him go free?",
  "27593": "All that seven hundred dollars?",
  "27594": "But meantime, how am I to get on with my washing?",
  "27595": "Are there then chains for two which are forged on high?",
  "27596": "Then why don't you go?",
  "27597": "How could you have gone away and left me?",
  "27598": "Oh, why had not she, like this woman, resisted, implored?",
  "27599": "Yes, child, but why don't we take him into the parlour, now that we've got a nice parlour for company?",
  "27600": "Is any better than experience and wisdom and reason?",
  "27601": "Is it my fault that your father has dishonored himself?",
  "27602": "But can that which is neither become both?",
  "27603": "But he really is disinterested, and above small jealousy and spite, I have heard?",
  "27604": "And he rests now, near his companions, in the coral cemetery?",
  "27605": "What are we to do, now?",
  "27606": "And now, where is he gone?",
  "27607": "Do you not need to mitigate the struggle for existence more sanguine than the war of weapons?",
  "27608": "When will he come back?",
  "27609": "Suppose you haven't?",
  "27610": "Is it me, yer reverence?",
  "27611": "And why should I not dare?",
  "27612": "And is he in love perchance?",
  "27613": "Surely, this was not the only cause of estrangement?",
  "27614": "Where had he heard the name before?",
  "27615": "Where's my mother?",
  "27616": "Ah, isn't my whole point that he's charming to her?",
  "27617": "Were you looking for us?",
  "27618": "But tell me, and tell me true, what is the meaning of all this feasting, and who are these people?",
  "27619": "Has it begun?",
  "27620": "Where are you taking me?",
  "27621": "What's all this?",
  "27622": "Shall you be present in the reception room?",
  "27623": "What was the matter?",
  "27624": "An astrologer predicted that?",
  "27625": "What magazine, or treasury of bliss?",
  "27626": "What do I think?",
  "27627": "Ah, why DID he?",
  "27628": "How could I ask you to gif up so much for a poor old fellow, who has no fortune but a little learning?",
  "27629": "To whom, think ye, is your life of such consequence, that they should seek to bereave ye of it?",
  "27630": "Is it quite certain?",
  "27631": "Isn't that true, doctor?",
  "27632": "Clayton?",
  "27633": "Why do you not think so?",
  "27634": "And you will permit me to accompany you?",
  "27635": "And when he doesn't say pretty things?",
  "27636": "And you can refuse, you mean, eh?",
  "27637": "Sure, amn't I never done at the drunken bowsy ever since he left school?",
  "27638": "What, then, was there left to do?",
  "27639": "What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed?",
  "27640": "Are you so sure?",
  "27641": "Is that too simple a source of pleasure for some to prize?",
  "27642": "Then you knew her before?",
  "27643": "Have you not asked papa for money?",
  "27644": "Is there anything whimsical about me?",
  "27645": "Wouldn't it be nice if it could last?",
  "27646": "Is this ingratitude, however?",
  "27647": "For nothing?",
  "27648": "The winch, you say?",
  "27649": "Was ever a man in such a fearful fool's position?",
  "27650": "But this kind man who has done so much will, I am sure, take you right on to my house?",
  "27651": "But if no one among us is capable of governing himself, then who among us has the capacity to govern someone else?",
  "27652": "Was personal happiness the aim and object of their ambition?",
  "27653": "Have you ever seen a wire jacket?",
  "27654": "Cranmer awaits us in the private chapel?",
  "27655": "And how about today's telegram?",
  "27656": "Where had that daring singer got to?",
  "27657": "Was it he who threw us that bottle, when the vessel made her first cruise?",
  "27658": "You didn't mean to ask that?",
  "27659": "Brilliant?",
  "27660": "Getting a little beyond our depth, dear, aren't we?",
  "27661": "Now, what is competition?",
  "27662": "Why didn't you come near us all these three days, eh?",
  "27663": "Do you know that you are speaking to me quite as a friend?",
  "27664": "What do you do then?",
  "27665": "Do you think we live as cheaply as we might?",
  "27666": "You haven't opened the parcel and swallowed one or two as you come along, have you?",
  "27667": "Surely there are classified lists?",
  "27668": "Who knows whether man is not a recaptured offender against divine justice?",
  "27669": "Why ride into the middle of the battalion?",
  "27670": "May I ask if you can confirm these statements?",
  "27671": "Is not this an infallible and sovereign antidote?",
  "27672": "Well, what's this now?",
  "27673": "Isn't it fortunate I've got such an imagination?",
  "27674": "Now, what have we a right to possess?",
  "27675": "A cigarette?",
  "27676": "But what did he do, my dear?",
  "27677": "What act?",
  "27678": "What in thunder is it?",
  "27679": "And the man?",
  "27680": "How am I to understand you, mon pere?",
  "27681": "Why dilate upon what everybody knows?",
  "27682": "Might this be for you, sir?",
  "27683": "How can you learn lessons in here?",
  "27684": "Who be these?",
  "27685": "Do you love my son?",
  "27686": "Who gets up in the gray dawn to call on another man's wife?",
  "27687": "What follows that angel?",
  "27688": "Will it strengthen our families and support our children?",
  "27689": "Why where should I leave them but where I found them?",
  "27690": "Shall he now be arrested in his desolating career?",
  "27691": "Do you know what that means?",
  "27692": "But why should I make a long story of it?",
  "27693": "Mightn't I stay and sleep with you tonight, grandmother?",
  "27694": "Are you not jealous at all?",
  "27695": "And is not the chief object of vanity, our bravery or learning, our wit or breeding, our eloquence or address, our taste or abilities?",
  "27696": "Jo, I hope you haven't done anything rash?",
  "27697": "And do you believe it to be so?",
  "27698": "Do you take milk in yours?",
  "27699": "What fiend is this?",
  "27700": "Where are they?",
  "27701": "Would any one believe it?",
  "27702": "What if I've accepted too passively the funny form of our life?",
  "27703": "What, indeed, can tend to deprave the character more than outward submission and inward contempt?",
  "27704": "If they bite and kick?",
  "27705": "Is there that about me that should affright a man?",
  "27706": "For how can any experience be adequate with an idea?",
  "27707": "What is this I hear about you?",
  "27708": "How old are you, dear?",
  "27709": "I wonder if they made that fearful sound I heard just before you came?",
  "27710": "What made them kick you out?",
  "27711": "Am I allowed to repeat it?",
  "27712": "I think that this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with me for six o'clock?",
  "27713": "Have you any dice in your pocket?",
  "27714": "What on earth put such a notion into your head?",
  "27715": "None belonging to your father?",
  "27716": "What had he to say?",
  "27717": "Owing to him?",
  "27718": "To me, sir?",
  "27719": "What do you suppose she wants to talk about tomorrow?",
  "27720": "Would he say a lie?",
  "27721": "How much money had these men fraudulently obtained?",
  "27722": "How many have you loved?",
  "27723": "Then why, when you were able to run away, did you go back to him?",
  "27724": "And don't you think the governor ought to let me have it?",
  "27725": "You are alone?",
  "27726": "What are your favourite flowers?",
  "27727": "Why didn't I go in then?",
  "27728": "By your misfortune?",
  "27729": "Now are you satisfied?",
  "27730": "Who is your lady friend with the big grey envelope and the fat monogram outside?",
  "27731": "Have you got them?",
  "27732": "Did you get lost?",
  "27733": "I wonder how he felt when he heard it?",
  "27734": "What need for weapon?",
  "27735": "'Ow many times have I got to tell you to be careful of them plates?",
  "27736": "Weevle?",
  "27737": "What you're after, why you left the block house, why you given me that there chart, I don't know, now, do I?",
  "27738": "Are we falling?",
  "27739": "And by character?",
  "27740": "And would not a really good education furnish the best safeguard?",
  "27741": "What manner of man are you?",
  "27742": "I think you are growing less cool, my friend, and are beginning to be a trifle surprised, aren't you?",
  "27743": "And that one?",
  "27744": "Has he ever taken from the rich that he did not give again to the poor?",
  "27745": "Has your mother relented at last?",
  "27746": "What do you want to do?",
  "27747": "Is this all your spinning, grandmother?",
  "27748": "What sort of ship?",
  "27749": "And do they not share?",
  "27750": "Why isn't it enough?",
  "27751": "Shall I meet strange, heavenly things?",
  "27752": "Didn't I see him seize your hand?",
  "27753": "What is that thing?",
  "27754": "But who else?",
  "27755": "Why, how?",
  "27756": "Do you hear, my children?",
  "27757": "Can you deny that all that was craft and deceit and fraud and greed?",
  "27758": "You mean that she will be killed merely to thwart me?",
  "27759": "How shall we set about it?",
  "27760": "Not too difficult?",
  "27761": "Were his father's religious devotion, his teachers warnings, his own knowledge, his own search able to keep him safe?",
  "27762": "Should they be embarked?",
  "27763": "Is my experience but of yesterday?",
  "27764": "Can I trust in you?",
  "27765": "Are you in earnest?",
  "27766": "Where are you to go?",
  "27767": "Do you want to earn half a crown?",
  "27768": "Wilcox?",
  "27769": "What do I mean?",
  "27770": "But will no one remain in the house, my lord?",
  "27771": "How, then, with these variations and with revenues so uncertain, can we establish even distribution and uniform wages for laborers?",
  "27772": "Of the hearses?",
  "27773": "But will you not drink with me, sir?",
  "27774": "What avail is it?",
  "27775": "Don't you see them?",
  "27776": "Oh, I must, hey?",
  "27777": "Or are they both in this their own reward?",
  "27778": "Said ye not truly, aforetime, that we should live and meet?",
  "27779": "What do we do?",
  "27780": "How will you live?",
  "27781": "Why don't you fall yourself?",
  "27782": "Will you remember that, if you please?",
  "27783": "Does he read ee very long zermons, my dear?",
  "27784": "What is a passport?",
  "27785": "How long do you remain in town?",
  "27786": "Don't you, old man?",
  "27787": "Where shall I see the head of him which contrived to murder his father, which I will tear to pieces with my own hands?",
  "27788": "Why this absence of mind, and sweet irresolution?",
  "27789": "We better than you?",
  "27790": "Did this mad wife of his carry it off with her?",
  "27791": "Had the man seen through him?",
  "27792": "But will you promise to have me took there, sir, and laid along with him?",
  "27793": "But if I do not marry?",
  "27794": "Why did he interfere with me, and fill your mind with such falsehood?",
  "27795": "But when one has no experience, how can one tell what is sickness and what is health?",
  "27796": "How can you tell who is poor?",
  "27797": "Is it so precious?",
  "27798": "Why am I to be disturbed?",
  "27799": "Will you take my advice?",
  "27800": "Something important?",
  "27801": "Perhaps you think I am mad, eh?",
  "27802": "Shall you have the courage?",
  "27803": "Will you forget him?",
  "27804": "Wait for you?",
  "27805": "Now, what fault can you point out in him?",
  "27806": "CUI BONO?",
  "27807": "Where had the dragon gone in such a short space of time?",
  "27808": "You've got a friend here?",
  "27809": "What has he made you?",
  "27810": "You keep the registers of entries and departures?",
  "27811": "To what tribe do they belong?",
  "27812": "I don't suppose that you have noticed it?",
  "27813": "Couldn't you ask him here dinner or something?",
  "27814": "And then?",
  "27815": "What does your wife want?",
  "27816": "Couldn't you wish to be married to him yourself, if that was the case?",
  "27817": "You notice those bright green spots scattered thickly over it?",
  "27818": "It was his life or mine, but far more than that, it was his life or hers, for how could I leave her in the power of this madman?",
  "27819": "Then there is a truth I don't know?",
  "27820": "How did I get hold of that?",
  "27821": "Whatever is the matter?",
  "27822": "And it is true that you did not set it on fire?",
  "27823": "Has anything unpleasant happened since I saw you?",
  "27824": "Is it believed that axioms in metaphysics, declarations of right, harangues from the tribune, will put a stop to the disbanding of an army?",
  "27825": "What does not a man undergo for the sake of a cure?",
  "27826": "Shan't you?",
  "27827": "You a member here?",
  "27828": "What is your own experience of him?",
  "27829": "But aren't you mistaken in thinking that you wouldn't force him, wouldn't punish him?",
  "27830": "Me, young ladies?",
  "27831": "What are these corruptions?",
  "27832": "Doesn't he?",
  "27833": "Why must he look farther than their platform when he claims himself to stand by his platform?",
  "27834": "Now, surely, if he takes so warmly to people who are not related to him at all, may he not take as warmly to his own kin?",
  "27835": "Not since the humour of gentility was upon you, did you?",
  "27836": "Governor come round?",
  "27837": "That boy's tutor?",
  "27838": "What is a soul?",
  "27839": "And with our wives?",
  "27840": "Who would think of plotting with a poor little weak creature like me?",
  "27841": "What is his exact kin to us, mother?",
  "27842": "Is this a new brand of humour?",
  "27843": "Yes, what were we talking about?",
  "27844": "Do I know them?",
  "27845": "And what business have you here?",
  "27846": "You know who bricks and mortar is, I suppose, sir?",
  "27847": "Oh, what's the use of me saying anything?",
  "27848": "I make the first advances?",
  "27849": "Why strive for the knowledge of things if we become more cowardly thereby?",
  "27850": "Why, how do you come to be here?",
  "27851": "What the devil is he doing here?",
  "27852": "What's he to do with the lassie?",
  "27853": "Why must people kneel down to pray?",
  "27854": "Do you like him?",
  "27855": "First tell the boys, what we have decided?",
  "27856": "What is it to be?",
  "27857": "Tell us, dear, what do the creatures look like?",
  "27858": "Do you see that whale now?",
  "27859": "How is it that there are birds enough ready to replace immediately a lost mate of either sex?",
  "27860": "You admit, I hope, that I have a right to speak about what concerns the dignity of my wife's sister?",
  "27861": "Will somebody hand me anything hard and bruising to pelt at her?",
  "27862": "Is he industrious at his work and respectful to you?",
  "27863": "That's the way the song runs, isn't it?",
  "27864": "Could her face inspire passion at all now?",
  "27865": "Why ought I to know?",
  "27866": "And you are not furious?",
  "27867": "Ellen, are not you tired?",
  "27868": "Will you let me go away?",
  "27869": "John, why don't you say something?",
  "27870": "But what shall I tell the dairyman's wife?",
  "27871": "And you don't know what they do it for?",
  "27872": "Or at some public school, perhaps?",
  "27873": "They do, do they?",
  "27874": "Is not the night mournful, sad, and melancholic?",
  "27875": "I asked them, if they were at liberty to tell me the truth of what they were to do with me?",
  "27876": "Why are you sorry, sir?",
  "27877": "What prison is he in?",
  "27878": "Shall we go on, your excellency, fine champagne?",
  "27879": "Leave our brother to come to us?",
  "27880": "Will you really not have tea?",
  "27881": "Whom do you expect to find here?",
  "27882": "Have you no other to propose?",
  "27883": "What can a writer, who professes scepticism, have in common with radical views?",
  "27884": "See that blue dory behind him?",
  "27885": "But is an education which ignores them all a liberal education?",
  "27886": "What upon?",
  "27887": "But who has told you?",
  "27888": "Where are my priwileges?",
  "27889": "Well, did she say what she was coming for?",
  "27890": "How can I ever thank you?",
  "27891": "You own the name and renounce the alias?",
  "27892": "Is he of noble family, and rich?",
  "27893": "How then are we to begin our strike to destroy him?",
  "27894": "Who is this boy?",
  "27895": "And who hit you at all?",
  "27896": "What are these men's leading principles, and about what kind of things are they busy, and for what kind of reasons do they love and honor?",
  "27897": "Thornfield?",
  "27898": "May I ask if you are very busy just now?",
  "27899": "How can it concern him to learn how the self came to be what it is, or what it will be in the distant future?",
  "27900": "You think it will?",
  "27901": "But why should I weary you with details?",
  "27902": "So you kept him after all?",
  "27903": "And the queen?",
  "27904": "That we see before our noses?",
  "27905": "Can I never tell my story in a plain, straightforward way?",
  "27906": "Can competition in labor be abolished?",
  "27907": "You cannot help us?",
  "27908": "But what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance?",
  "27909": "What was the use of his being somewhere in the neighbourhood if she had no means of knowing where she could find him?",
  "27910": "You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?",
  "27911": "You will protect me from him?",
  "27912": "Had you heard?",
  "27913": "Can you remember that?",
  "27914": "Ever live by cheating at play?",
  "27915": "Why do you permit such a surgeon to have the care of the sick, wounded, and dying soldiers?",
  "27916": "And is that why he hits her?",
  "27917": "Why, what is there to understand?",
  "27918": "Yet you have a large establishment, too, I am told?",
  "27919": "And you think that I am going to send you back to that world which must know me no more?",
  "27920": "What is done to infanticides in this country?",
  "27921": "And did you see anyone?",
  "27922": "Well, then, what makes you talk so wild?",
  "27923": "You have formed one, then?",
  "27924": "Will you please pardon my rudeness?",
  "27925": "My dear father, may I beg you to prepare your mind for what I am going to say?",
  "27926": "With what my father said just now?",
  "27927": "What did you think of that, sir?",
  "27928": "Would you like me to sit down for a minute or two?",
  "27929": "He is going with you, is he not?",
  "27930": "Of what disposition is he?",
  "27931": "What is it, then?",
  "27932": "Where did you really get them?",
  "27933": "Mark must be here, yet why doesn't he answer me?",
  "27934": "What did you expect to gain by that?",
  "27935": "What heart can hold?",
  "27936": "When horses are injured, are they improved or deteriorated?",
  "27937": "Had he left her there to her fate in the lonely jungle?",
  "27938": "How do you do, all of you?",
  "27939": "Do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not talk as fast, and admire what she admires as rapturously as herself?",
  "27940": "Curious?",
  "27941": "Do you intend to sit up for me?",
  "27942": "But would the man acknowledge the relation?",
  "27943": "What are you doing now?",
  "27944": "Do you suppose that if I had made such a revelation to the king, I should have been alive now?",
  "27945": "He had a passion for pictures, and why should he not be able to paint as well as anybody else?",
  "27946": "Are you the gentleman who caused the accident?",
  "27947": "And the pay?",
  "27948": "Husband?",
  "27949": "I know what everyone would say is the right thing to do, but what do you say?",
  "27950": "What difference can it make to you?",
  "27951": "How could he know what comes from a woman's wavering sympathies, what from her inborn coquetry, and what from love itself?",
  "27952": "Was he a proprietor, or only a usufructuary?",
  "27953": "Wasn't that nonsensical?",
  "27954": "You have sold all your clothes?",
  "27955": "Surely you learnt that too?",
  "27956": "WHAT is it?",
  "27957": "But at this moment who knows if we may not be frightfully crushed between the two glassy surfaces?",
  "27958": "We must take care that that affair comes off all right, must we not?",
  "27959": "Why do you shake me like that?",
  "27960": "Now really should a cock be brought into a tragic play?",
  "27961": "Is his thread spun?",
  "27962": "Have not you an intimate friend?",
  "27963": "But how, and wherewith?",
  "27964": "That was a very different account of matters, was it not?",
  "27965": "What laws mean you?",
  "27966": "And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps?",
  "27967": "And on what will you sleep?",
  "27968": "That is what comes of your gospel of love, is it?",
  "27969": "Beautiful?",
  "27970": "Didn't say nothin' 'bout my old man, s'pose?",
  "27971": "Is it really possible that perfectly innocent people are kept here?",
  "27972": "You know the road?",
  "27973": "So if I say they're gone, you'll bear me witness, will you?",
  "27974": "Why should you not mention the sum?",
  "27975": "They're quite neat and decent, aren't they?",
  "27976": "To what a devil, then, said he, serve so many paltry heaps and bundles of papers and copies which you give me?",
  "27977": "How did you get such small small legs?",
  "27978": "But why shouldn't they petition, doctor?",
  "27979": "What is that news?",
  "27980": "His nieces accompany him, no doubt?",
  "27981": "Well, but whom are you attacking?",
  "27982": "Am I fool?",
  "27983": "What should hinder it?",
  "27984": "Is this true, my pulse?",
  "27985": "Have you given in your resignation, mademoiselle?",
  "27986": "How can you make yourself so inferior to me, as to show such a bad spirit?",
  "27987": "How can that be managed?",
  "27988": "When shall we be able to fish again?",
  "27989": "And what may your purpose be, most lofty lady?",
  "27990": "And when the better part of their products are consumed by others at the play, do you assure me that their families are not in want?",
  "27991": "Do I combine?",
  "27992": "What good was there in doing that?",
  "27993": "How can you do it seriously?",
  "27994": "Read?",
  "27995": "Was I absurd?",
  "27996": "Live like this?",
  "27997": "And if I could, what comfort to me?",
  "27998": "Aglaya, may I kiss YOUR prince?",
  "27999": "You mean to ask, I said, what will be our answer?",
  "28000": "You do not mean to inherit that infamous crotchet my brother has got into his head?",
  "28001": "Not a circus?",
  "28002": "Well, what have you got in your ear?",
  "28003": "What came of it?",
  "28004": "What makes it smell so funny?",
  "28005": "Which way are you going?",
  "28006": "Sure, little woman?",
  "28007": "The boy's, then?",
  "28008": "How d'you account for the general indifference, then?",
  "28009": "Why do you delay?",
  "28010": "Proud, eh?",
  "28011": "Since no man has aught of what he leaves, what is't to leave betimes?",
  "28012": "How is he?",
  "28013": "Were there not the brilliant particles of a halo in the air about his head?",
  "28014": "I therefore turned towards him with a stern countenance, and asked, who he called fool?",
  "28015": "What should ye have in common with cats and wolves?",
  "28016": "You want me to swear?",
  "28017": "What you standing there for?",
  "28018": "Perhaps he is just as fond of suffering?",
  "28019": "What's the matter with you, old man?",
  "28020": "Married woman, I believe?",
  "28021": "Will you grant it to me?",
  "28022": "And the chin, with its dimples, as in health, might it not be hers?",
  "28023": "What will happen then?",
  "28024": "You mean that the thing is supernatural?",
  "28025": "And if I do speak to her, my lord, what then?",
  "28026": "Was it sufficient?",
  "28027": "Have you ever committed a sin?",
  "28028": "Presented to whom?",
  "28029": "Not for myself?",
  "28030": "Well, sir, will you go?",
  "28031": "Where did you go?",
  "28032": "What have we done?",
  "28033": "Do you jog hither, wagging your tails, to pant at my wine, and bepiss my barrel?",
  "28034": "What was going on in congress?",
  "28035": "Do you need a doctor?",
  "28036": "Why, oh why, have I betrayed myself?",
  "28037": "Had he any intellect, any thinking faculty, any consciousness of his own existence?",
  "28038": "Outspoken, is she?",
  "28039": "Is it honouring your husband to dishonour his business?",
  "28040": "To whom resort for relief?",
  "28041": "What must be done then?",
  "28042": "Are yours like that?",
  "28043": "And now, are you aware of one thing, monsieur?",
  "28044": "Is he on this farm?",
  "28045": "Now, did you not think so?",
  "28046": "What do men know about women's martyrdoms?",
  "28047": "What can be done?",
  "28048": "What are you going to do if you don't get work?",
  "28049": "Is the room to be got ready upstairs?",
  "28050": "Will you be silent?",
  "28051": "But how could she?",
  "28052": "Don't you all despise me for not stealing, when it would have been only justice?",
  "28053": "How shall I bring forth my wife?",
  "28054": "And the greater the interval which separates them from philosophy and reason, the more strange and illusive will be the pleasure?",
  "28055": "Does he also desire his archic man to be got up in a manner befitting royalty at a certain date?",
  "28056": "What can I do for you, my child?",
  "28057": "Well, the question is, what do you know about her?",
  "28058": "What was the chief trade in this place?",
  "28059": "Suppose that she coulde pittie me, what then?",
  "28060": "Where is the child?",
  "28061": "What will you take?",
  "28062": "But who could have foreseen such an attention as this?",
  "28063": "Do you know I have entrusted him with our secret?",
  "28064": "Your sister is dead, then?",
  "28065": "What have I done to displease you?",
  "28066": "How begot, how nourished?",
  "28067": "What was the good of playing?",
  "28068": "Would she not be marvellously fair to look upon when in happy mood, seeing that she is so fair in her displeasure?",
  "28069": "Any youngsters?",
  "28070": "Can a man who possesses the slightest common sense be so unreasonable?",
  "28071": "Have you kept him in the cellar all this time?",
  "28072": "Did either of you boys touch it?",
  "28073": "Why has HE done nothing?",
  "28074": "Arrest you, my most faithful servant?",
  "28075": "Might be a pun on my pottering about here, mightn't it?",
  "28076": "Why did she betray the two of them so terribly, in embracing the glow of the evening?",
  "28077": "Are you a missionary?",
  "28078": "And in what condition?",
  "28079": "What haven't you, love, said in your time?",
  "28080": "Did they have any repinings because of their course?",
  "28081": "You understand what I mean?",
  "28082": "And why shouldn't I?",
  "28083": "You serve the cardinal?",
  "28084": "Where is his pistol?",
  "28085": "What DOES it call itself, I wonder?",
  "28086": "Was she not very much surprised?",
  "28087": "But what is that blockhead of a benevolent gentleman doing?",
  "28088": "And how do you know my heart is innocent?",
  "28089": "Shall I leave you?",
  "28090": "So what does it matter?",
  "28091": "But how have you procured them from your mother?",
  "28092": "Or whether we should hold that cowardice makes no difference in the end, seeing that we all must share alike?",
  "28093": "Now, do you find the business good, and the investment advantageous?",
  "28094": "And I dare say you sing a little, too?",
  "28095": "Was she normal?",
  "28096": "Are their heads off?",
  "28097": "This page or this page?",
  "28098": "What kind of a man is he?",
  "28099": "For who, let me ask, ever heard of a balloon manufactured entirely of dirty newspapers?",
  "28100": "Will you tell me how that came about?",
  "28101": "For how can we know all the possible cases that may arise?",
  "28102": "But now I have told you, you don't think it wrong of me, do you?",
  "28103": "And why should she expect her brother to do that which her brother's guests would decline to do?",
  "28104": "Do you know that if I were not consumptive, I would kill myself?",
  "28105": "What was there in the young girl's glance on this occasion?",
  "28106": "And then, why did he not at least answer it?",
  "28107": "But where are they, then?",
  "28108": "And then he can write back to my address, and I can smuggle the letter to you?",
  "28109": "Won what, ma'am?",
  "28110": "What dreadful thing drives her to say this, father, when it is such a pain to her?",
  "28111": "How long would the race endure if the parental instinct were wholly lacking?",

  "28113": "What then, my gentle sister?",
  "28114": "Which of the two will be the first to fall?",
  "28115": "Was this the right corner to turn?",
  "28116": "What are we?",
  "28117": "Who of you have done more?",
  "28118": "Get it?",
  "28119": "Whose hand's out?",
  "28120": "Alas, do you love nothing else in me?",
  "28121": "Shall we send the watch there?",
  "28122": "Would you mind my taking 'em out and looking at 'em for a minute, to see how they are made?",
  "28123": "Would you believe it?",
  "28124": "But you were married?",
  "28125": "Jespersen?",
  "28126": "Is papa alive?",
  "28127": "How is she?",

  "28130": "But is it so?",
  "28131": "And with whom?",
  "28132": "Don't you see, you brute, that my dog is a lurcher?",
  "28133": "What has it turned to, then?",
  "28134": "What would she say if she knew the truth?",
  "28135": "Don't you see you are the very one to bring yourself and family here?",
  "28136": "You loved your mother, then?",
  "28137": "I wonder what we both did that for?",
  "28138": "Damn you, sir, will you let me look inside that cab?",
  "28139": "Is there no voice in your mother's heart that forbids you to destroy your son's ideals?",
  "28140": "Been havin' a snooze, ole boy?",
  "28141": "Have you the tact?",
  "28142": "I could even go with you now?",
  "28143": "What shall you wear?",
  "28144": "How large is the garland?",
  "28145": "You are wrong, and what can you do better with your leisure hours?",
  "28146": "What did you do next?",
  "28147": "Well, where are you taking me, then?",
  "28148": "What was it he talked about?",
  "28149": "Will it hold water?",
  "28150": "Is this the missis?",
  "28151": "How shall the lots be drawn?",
  "28152": "Cannot make you understand WHAT?",
  "28153": "What'll they think of us?",
  "28154": "Who would have believed it?",
  "28155": "What means this woman?",

  "28163": "Doctor seen them?",
  "28164": "So there's nothing?",
  "28165": "And shall we eat bread?",
  "28166": "Ankle all right, eh?",
  "28167": "But who was she?",
  "28168": "Why should there often be so great a difference in the result of a reciprocal cross between the same two species?",
  "28169": "Is there any better or equal hope in the world?",
  "28170": "But I wanted to ask you directly what you think of me, of my life?",
  "28171": "Of course, if one doesn't go to a public school those sort of schools are the next best thing, aren't they?",
  "28172": "Are you quite impervious to good advice?",
  "28173": "Captain's a great feller, ain't he?",
  "28174": "What is the matter with me?",
  "28175": "Did you see herself?",
  "28176": "Are we lovers?",
  "28177": "And how could you think o' going to the pond, and taking your sister where there was dirt?",
  "28178": "Against D'Artagnan?",
  "28179": "What lineage, what lineage?",
  "28180": "Did you post that letter yourself?",
  "28181": "But is it a kind heart?",
  "28182": "Shall we descend to the party at all?",
  "28183": "You are not playing with us?",
  "28184": "But why did it not kill my father?",
  "28185": "What other view could he have?",
  "28186": "And because you fear that it may be?",
  "28187": "Such a thing as a what?",
  "28188": "Are you trying to find out something bad about me?",
  "28189": "You lost your school and good income through her, did you not?",
  "28190": "Shall I take her to a coach?",
  "28191": "Was it his profile that was seen on the blind two nights before?",
  "28192": "When you became engaged to the young lady whom you have just mentioned, did you make a regular proposal to her family?",

  "28209": "Won't that make a queer combination?",
  "28210": "Haven't you got it on now?",
  "28211": "About the way in which we've treated that angel of a girl?",
  "28212": "By nothing?",
  "28213": "You watch while I sleep and you have come to bring me some news?",
  "28214": "Then why did ye not seek him there?",
  "28215": "And what object or consideration more pleasing than this can be presented to the human mind?",
  "28216": "Where did you go to school?",
  "28217": "Did you see the exquisite old lace she sent me?",
  "28218": "Which was first, thirst or drinking?",

  "28224": "How can we not always think of her?",
  "28225": "YOU of importance to him in any way?",
  "28226": "Nor sold him anything, perhaps?",
  "28227": "Do you wish me to tell you it is good?",
  "28228": "Will you excuse me if I leave you for half an hour?",
  "28229": "What is to do?",
  "28230": "Who told you that?",
  "28231": "You can't see me home if that's what you mean?",
  "28232": "Does your majesty wish for your attendants at once?",
  "28233": "Will your business take long to state?",
  "28234": "Yes, dear boy?",
  "28235": "If we jest at them, what will our servants do?",
  "28236": "Have you tried him on the subject?",
  "28237": "Some of you gentlemen going to play for me this evening?",

  "28245": "What may be your calling?",
  "28246": "What the value of those literary charms which are absolutely destroyed by their enjoyment?",
  "28247": "Has not that fire, that lies harmless and unseen in the sticks, the power to consume the whole country?",
  "28248": "You would often see him?",
  "28249": "How must I quit her?",
  "28250": "Can it be that it is all over?",

  "28751": "What if he should be no gentleman now, but a clown indeed, lady?",
  "28752": "Who, his parents?",
  "28753": "May I go with you?",
  "28754": "Do you see it?",
  "28755": "Where can you begin?",
  "28756": "Will your eminence please read and examine?",
  "28757": "Why, how in the nation did they ever git into such a scrape?",
  "28758": "Where did the shipwreck occur?",
  "28759": "Did one ever hear of such a thing?",
  "28760": "Is anything the matter?",
  "28761": "What you demand of me is serious, then?",
  "28762": "What then, in the name of heaven, could you go to war for?",
  "28763": "Surely there is no danger of anything so dreadful?",
  "28764": "What must one day come and may not pass by?",
  "28765": "Well, madame?",
  "28766": "Have you got the cartridges?",
  "28767": "To go with you for?",
  "28768": "Don't you think that is extraordinarily generous?",
  "28769": "Is there no debt to pay, no boon to grant?",
  "28770": "You don't expect anybody to believe this, about the lady and the sovereign, do you?",
  "28771": "Then, perhaps, you cannot tell me what sort of a woman she is?",
  "28772": "Ye are frightened?",
  "28773": "But how in the world did you know that he was in the house at all?",
  "28774": "May I venture to congratulate you?",
  "28775": "A successor?",
  "28776": "Shall not we two lie on the bridal bed this same night?",
  "28777": "Did all enjoy it?",
  "28778": "Don't you use a study?",
  "28779": "Isn't it damp?",
  "28780": "How was it wrought to such perfection?",
  "28781": "Am I likely to be frozen?",
  "28782": "A presentation?",
  "28783": "Does he wish it?",
  "28784": "Why did you?",
  "28785": "The decline of his fortunes, then?",
  "28786": "What was the cause of such degeneration?",
  "28787": "They are coming, then?",
  "28788": "How can you talk about shame, papa?",
  "28789": "Who is to throw a stone?",
  "28790": "How so, my pet?",
  "28791": "Ambulance or train?",
  "28792": "Dare I ask you to explain?",
  "28793": "Only what are we to talk about?",
  "28794": "Will your ladyship honour me with the CONTREDANSE until your coach is ready?",
  "28795": "Again, if there be nothing real in the universe, what is it that causes unreal objects to appear?",
  "28796": "What do you want of me?",
  "28797": "Not the old business?",
  "28798": "Somebody was coming?",
  "28799": "Mad one, what have I said?",
  "28800": "Do you know I am dissatisfied with your younger son?",
  "28801": "In pain, where?",
  "28802": "Doth it long for knowledge as the lion for his food?",
  "28803": "But what other ways?",
  "28804": "So I come and take, and what do I do?",
  "28805": "But why have you no packing bag?",
  "28806": "He does your bidding?",
  "28807": "Had he not better take the big umbrella?",
  "28808": "But of what?",
  "28809": "Shall you be there, sir?",
  "28810": "You didn't know him, did you?",
  "28811": "Mamma, are you asleep?",
  "28812": "Have I not, sir?",
  "28813": "And so many children poor?",
  "28814": "At least, what?",
  "28815": "Are not the roofs and the lintels wet?",
  "28816": "At what time did he go?",
  "28817": "Perfectly plain, isn't it?",
  "28818": "Then how could they tear me pitilessly from all that was dear to me, and lock me up in prison like a wild animal?",
  "28819": "And who's to make him?",
  "28820": "How did the boat strike when she went in?",
  "28821": "How hight she?",
  "28822": "You understand what I mean?",
  "28823": "But is not war an art?",
  "28824": "Postponed?",
  "28825": "She is, is she?",
  "28826": "Who is fit for it?",
  "28827": "Do you not as a rule think women below your notice as companions?",
  "28828": "Will you tell me where the BRITANNIA was wrecked?",
  "28829": "What chance had they against one who, if she had a mind, could put by out of her income twice as much as they, poor women, could spend?",
  "28830": "What mede is aye to live in comfort?",
  "28831": "Who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads?",
  "28832": "Who's over me?",
  "28833": "Why, in the devil's name, have they served me thus?",
  "28834": "You know her husband, of course?",
  "28835": "Is it possible that the meaning of life was not disclosed to him before he died?",
  "28836": "Are you brutes?",
  "28837": "Think it'll ride?",
  "28838": "What'll the other people in the house say to my being here?",
  "28839": "But was it all there was of life?",
  "28840": "What private box?",
  "28841": "A little buttered toast with the tea?",
  "28842": "Nor written?",
  "28843": "Would I not give all that I have of strength at one blow if I could open his eyes to see as I see but for one minute?",
  "28844": "Consequently, a capital blade?",
  "28845": "And break it out?",
  "28846": "He has the horse, then?",
  "28847": "You're not sorry you've come, are you?",
  "28848": "The entrance cannot be easy?",
  "28849": "Why do I not give it?",
  "28850": "And does that hinder you from letting me know the second reason?",
  "28851": "Clarence?",
  "28852": "Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy?",
  "28853": "Why did you play us such a trick, damn you?",
  "28854": "What is his object?",
  "28855": "What would happen next?",
  "28856": "Who might do this but the women?",
  "28857": "Why don't you scream?",
  "28858": "Do you know that?",
  "28859": "Why, my dear friend, do I not see you?",
  "28860": "But, in truth, what is the good of these disguises?",
  "28861": "Will that restore it to sight?",
  "28862": "Where is this person?",
  "28863": "What can a man spend his ha'pence on here in this country hole?",
  "28864": "Catharine, did I do wrong?",
  "28865": "How much are you out of pocket?",
  "28866": "What has become of her?",
  "28867": "Could we advertise, then, asking for information from wharfingers?",
  "28868": "Does this infinite awaken in us the idea of essence, while we can attribute to ourselves only the idea of existence?",
  "28869": "We will say ten o'clock then?",
  "28870": "To its honors, to its flowers, to its golden aspirations?",
  "28871": "But always smelling those leather books, what can be expected?",
  "28872": "Is it not time for a change?",
  "28873": "What did happen to me?",
  "28874": "Do you think now that I shall tell you what motive he had had in starting out?",
  "28875": "You perhaps think I should have expected this refusal?",
  "28876": "And your cargo?",
  "28877": "You do like me a bit, don't you?",
  "28878": "Who was killed in another place?",
  "28879": "What's the game?",
  "28880": "Not related to her, sir?",
  "28881": "But, they say, is that true right, social right, fraternal right?",
  "28882": "Do you know, sir, that that man did all this?",
  "28883": "Did he give you anything else?",
  "28884": "Why should he die, for he felt that he could not live, under such a weight of obloquy?",
  "28885": "It's he then who has told you?",
  "28886": "Is that all?",
  "28887": "Took?",
  "28888": "How much do you know?",
  "28889": "Out of your own pocket?",
  "28890": "Why was it none would give it, then?",
  "28891": "Shall they be banished from the district, or from the whole land?",
  "28892": "Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?",
  "28893": "Did I abuse you?",
  "28894": "And who wants to be acquainted with you?",
  "28895": "What can you do?",
  "28896": "Are you in love with the cows?",
  "28897": "Not to her uncle?",
  "28898": "Why should it not, at a certain depth, attain an impassable limit, instead of rising to such a point as to fuse the most infusible metals?",
  "28899": "But why have you done it at all?",
  "28900": "Haven't you noticed it?",
  "28901": "And what does this groom do?",
  "28902": "Sun in your eyes and his face in the shadow?",
  "28903": "Would she hear of his being slapped and beat by drummers demnebly?",
  "28904": "Who did all that mischief?",
  "28905": "Ain't we gotta live?",
  "28906": "Are we at the pole?",
  "28907": "Do you hear, do you hear what he says?",
  "28908": "Don't you think you could find some work to do?",
  "28909": "Was he again to be disturbed?",
  "28910": "Was she going to act and keep house?",
  "28911": "But why does he have this idea of a horse?",
  "28912": "Was that his work or was it possibly the doing of someone who was bent upon counteracting his schemes?",
  "28913": "Two minutes wrong?",
  "28914": "Do you not guess, monsieur?",
  "28915": "Where's your horse?",
  "28916": "Will you give me something to eat and a bed?",
  "28917": "What would they do to assist them?",
  "28918": "Let us have the land?",
  "28919": "Does he ever pay the rent for you?",
  "28920": "Might I ask you, sir, to pacify my mind?",
  "28921": "It is difficult to rise above the jungle standards and reason by the light of civilized ways, is it not, my friend?",
  "28922": "What about your government and all this treatment?",
  "28923": "What the devil are you doing?",
  "28924": "What help is to be hoped for, what consolation, what solace?",
  "28925": "Or, may we not owe their visit to the dead colt?",
  "28926": "Where shall we search for him?",
  "28927": "Why should you keep such things from me?",
  "28928": "Physiology not an experimental science?",
  "28929": "What about the dough?",
  "28930": "Can she have loved my brother so little as to be able to forget him so soon?",
  "28931": "It wasn't then that she told you?",
  "28932": "What thing?",
  "28933": "Do you suppose she takes you for a symbol?",
  "28934": "No worse news of master, I hope, sir?",
  "28935": "Has she run away because we are come?",
  "28936": "Shall I tell her or not?",
  "28937": "But then, why had he permitted that man to leave him alive?",
  "28938": "What's that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for?",
  "28939": "On which of these actions did he reflect with the most pleasure, when he was summoned by the angel of death?",
  "28940": "How shall I don't?",
  "28941": "What was in there?",
  "28942": "But tell me, what is she?",
  "28943": "Wouldn't you like to be king of that splendid fairyland?",
  "28944": "Have you examined this extract from your report and compared it with the original?",
  "28945": "Is he ungrateful to no one else?",
  "28946": "Aye, how do you know he is?",
  "28947": "Does our friend eke out his modest income with a crossing?",
  "28948": "The stag spoke?",
  "28949": "What are the dangers which menace us?",
  "28950": "Monsieur does not then renounce his excursion for this evening?",
  "28951": "You imagine, I dare say, that you invented something quite new?",
  "28952": "Why shouldn't she win?",
  "28953": "Is there anything in what I say, or am I talking to no purpose?",
  "28954": "Was he already with the queen?",
  "28955": "What is the matter, that with all his ill usage of me, I cannot hate him?",
  "28956": "Now, I beseech you, do tell me, have you ever attended to their pairing and breeding?",
  "28957": "Oh, what have I done to be blessed with such friends?",
  "28958": "Two one pound notes, or friends?",
  "28959": "Can it be that the dog has not understood his master?",
  "28960": "Why indeed should they maintain a watch?",
  "28961": "What was I to do?",
  "28962": "So will you abandon your plan?",
  "28963": "What can I say that will enable you to understand the depth of my sorrow?",
  "28964": "Did she still love him?",
  "28965": "What you 'bout?",
  "28966": "And of the pleasures of love, and all other pleasures, the same holds good?",
  "28967": "What does she want?",
  "28968": "You needn't go yet, need you?",
  "28969": "Will it be safe to leave you there alone?",
  "28970": "How many things she knows, doesn't she?",
  "28971": "In your room?",
  "28972": "Then you won't forgive me?",
  "28973": "Can dignity of mind exist with such trivial cares?",
  "28974": "Ah, friends, do ye divine also my heart's double will?",
  "28975": "Who was th' lad what carried th' flag?",
  "28976": "Are they dead, ma'am?",
  "28977": "And what shall we have in lieu of it?",
  "28978": "It is a lovely night, and why should we not prolong our ride a little?",
  "28979": "Will she then have sufficient native energy to look into herself for comfort, and cultivate her dormant faculties?",
  "28980": "You will not come?",
  "28981": "For arrears of pay?",
  "28982": "Copperfield, my dear fellow, how do you do?",
  "28983": "And is the city which is under a tyrant rich or poor?",
  "28984": "Was it not too clear that, let the matter go how it would, there was no happiness in store for her?",
  "28985": "Would you kindly send one of your constables for two buckets of water?",
  "28986": "But what is there, then, above the sun?",
  "28987": "How is it you don't know?",
  "28988": "Why are they not given up to the church, as they ought to be?",
  "28989": "But you, d'Artagnan, what is the matter with you, and what has happened to you personally?",
  "28990": "To conceal his name?",
  "28991": "Is it at some set season?",
  "28992": "Did she know anything of his life upon the sea?",
  "28993": "Where is so awful a responsibility laid upon them?",
  "28994": "Well, my boy, what's there to prevent you?",
  "28995": "What more natural, after this, than the dream which came to him?",
  "28996": "If vices be genuine and virtue a deception, as you think, why do you call the inventors of that deceiving art sages?",
  "28997": "Has the law any eyes to witness your grief?",
  "28998": "How can I be vain when I know I'm homely?",
  "28999": "The little girl?",
  "29000": "Kicked on that occasion for cheating at dice?",
  "29001": "What proofs do you require?",
  "29002": "On business, eh?",
  "29003": "Why, what's happened?",
  "29004": "Not hurt you, did I?",
  "29005": "Was it the time the sandy cat walked round the balustrade?",
  "29006": "What insults, girl?",
  "29007": "And how does any one know whether he will stay days, months, or years?",
  "29008": "Well, how are you going to get out of that?",
  "29009": "Have you your stethoscope?",
  "29010": "Well, where can we find it?",
  "29011": "Was it mere social effect, fulfilment of ambition in the social world, in the community of mankind?",
  "29012": "How about this ad of yours?",
  "29013": "Do you still suppose that I am a boy ignorant of my own mind, and mistaking the impulses of my own soul?",
  "29014": "Must we then not be married, in order to sanctify the union of our hearts?",
  "29015": "Ay, but will you promise to come?",
  "29016": "What did you write about?",
  "29017": "Perhaps you are laughing again?",
  "29018": "So you think that these people have already quitted the island?",
  "29019": "What's a lad with good friends doing as loblolly boy?",
  "29020": "Who can tell if that mind, when the touchstone is applied to it, will not be found of a mean and vulgar character?",
  "29021": "But what time's breakfast, sir?",
  "29022": "Did you signal us, lording?",
  "29023": "Where was you raised?",
  "29024": "May I read it?",
  "29025": "Where is the treasure?",
  "29026": "You know?",
  "29027": "Snatch at it?",
  "29028": "Well, what say you to a friend that would take this bitter bargain off your hands?",
  "29029": "Just step into this corner a moment, will you?",
  "29030": "What will you do, dear?",
  "29031": "Who shall prevent him?",
  "29032": "Is it a profession?",
  "29033": "You admit you owe him three pounds then for a month's board?",
  "29034": "Have I not found her friendless, and cold, and comfortless?",
  "29035": "Is he learned?",
  "29036": "Ay, where are they?",
  "29037": "Who is there?",
  "29038": "Why should he feel joy at turning back?",
  "29039": "Must I really?",
  "29040": "And shall I not do as the first man?",
  "29041": "Thy work, the KARMA?",
  "29042": "It's queer, isn't it?",
  "29043": "Was I not a fool, when I refused to look at or speak to him?",
  "29044": "And may we say that this has been proven?",
  "29045": "Does she cook the dinner?",
  "29046": "How do you come to know it?",
  "29047": "She was confined at your house, was she not?",
  "29048": "Then why didn't you come to me to wipe them for you?",
  "29049": "Do you know who I am?",
  "29050": "Do you see that woman with the embroidered badge?",
  "29051": "Very well what did I say to you?",
  "29052": "Father, have you any objection to my going away?",
  "29053": "And you are afraid I shall be unhappy?",
  "29054": "To reign in my place and stead?",
  "29055": "I suppose?",
  "29056": "Does the day look clear again?",
  "29057": "What if I were to think a little about others?",
  "29058": "Why on earth did you shut yourself in?",
  "29059": "Do you really suppose?",
  "29060": "Why one to come and one to go?",
  "29061": "Is not that the bishop?",
  "29062": "Why will you ruin yourself, your family, and nation?",
  "29063": "Why such a hard sentence?",
  "29064": "Will he not fancy that the shadows which he formerly saw are truer than the objects which are now shown to him?",
  "29065": "May I go and see her?",
  "29066": "Where did you go this morning?",
  "29067": "So very soon?",
  "29068": "Well, sir, in writing against property, have I done more than quote the language of history?",
  "29069": "I unhappy?",
  "29070": "But do I see a handkerchief?",
  "29071": "But how did he come by his death?",
  "29072": "Can you believe it?",
  "29073": "But if you have big ideas you have to use big words to express them, haven't you?",
  "29074": "Do you think that was done last night?",
  "29075": "Which is the way to the chapel?",
  "29076": "May we, then, be permitted to speak of the past in the present?",
  "29077": "What victim?",
  "29078": "Do we not own the country?",
  "29079": "Raoul, did you ever see anybody hung?",
  "29080": "May I be permitted a word or two of advice?",
  "29081": "If not, where's he gone?",
  "29082": "What would they think of me?",
  "29083": "What says the abbe?",
  "29084": "Might it not be that she would calculate that an interview would thus be possible?",
  "29085": "Why linger to add to the number of the victims of our merciless enemies?",
  "29086": "What is bad?",
  "29087": "And what now?",
  "29088": "Was he actually in hiding from the police?",
  "29089": "Shall he in the meantime risk the character and interest of the nation in the hands of men to whom he can not give his confidence?",
  "29090": "What's the meaning of this?",
  "29091": "In the first place, what is the gentleman's name?",
  "29092": "Don't you want to go out, and walk around the moon, and pick up diamonds?",
  "29093": "But how was it possible to effect this?",
  "29094": "Will you let me?",
  "29095": "And look you, lord, times are not ill, so wherefore should I risk a change of days?",
  "29096": "That certainly seems a satisfactory explanation, does it not?",
  "29097": "Why, I suppose you'll make a dive for a hatful of diamonds, won't you?",
  "29098": "You have my birth certificate?",
  "29099": "Isn't this mattress hard enough, and the room dull enough, and pain bad enough, but THEY must torture me?",
  "29100": "What is our life when compared to theirs?",
  "29101": "Is it an odd speech, papa?",
  "29102": "Why don't we go in with them?",
  "29103": "Had you not observed it before?",
  "29104": "Then why didn't I sneeze?",
  "29105": "Who would attend him when he was sick?",
  "29106": "Till to your very doors the war be brought?",
  "29107": "A sleeping draught?",
  "29108": "Philip?",
  "29109": "But they may come any moment, for you left word that I awaited them?",
  "29110": "Why, indeed?",
  "29111": "Shall you?",
  "29112": "But how came the hand to discompose you so much, if it was only a letter of business?",
  "29113": "Why did this sudden conviction of a religious woman cast a terrible doubt in my mind?",
  "29114": "Was that then he or an inhuman thing moved by a lower soul?",
  "29115": "And the power which the eye possesses is a sort of effluence which is dispensed from the sun?",
  "29116": "What was one to think or feel?",
  "29117": "Can you tell the position of the rooms?",
  "29118": "To defend ourselves against attack?",
  "29119": "The child?",
  "29120": "You will marry me, won't you?",
  "29121": "When shall I have the answer, monseigneur?",
  "29122": "But where does it stay?",
  "29123": "D'you like that?",
  "29124": "You know that to be so?",
  "29125": "Was it possible to render any aid to the dying man?",
  "29126": "Widowed mother, perhaps?",
  "29127": "Has she mentioned me lately?",
  "29128": "And what your sorrow?",
  "29129": "Did you speak, my own?",
  "29130": "Is it only a voice?",
  "29131": "Why wonder about this?",
  "29132": "Did he not advertise?",
  "29133": "In what manner?",
  "29134": "What would they do if they found me?",
  "29135": "But how can I pay them?",
  "29136": "How was this done?",
  "29137": "Away from me?",
  "29138": "And, if so, surely there is good material in you?",
  "29139": "It was he did that, and amn't I a great wonder to think I've traced him ten days with that rent in my crown?",
  "29140": "What was the matter with you, baron?",
  "29141": "May I have the honour?",
  "29142": "Will you come into the garden?",
  "29143": "Will it satisfy them, in the future, if we have nothing to do with invasions and insurrections?",
  "29144": "But what are we to do with her when we have caught her?",
  "29145": "And what do you say of lovers of wine?",
  "29146": "Where now the splendid future of her poor duped children?",
  "29147": "So that is what you wanted the money for?",
  "29148": "Would you like to take her place?",
  "29149": "Was it in the papers yet?",
  "29150": "Who lives to the left there?",
  "29151": "Where shall we have tea?",
  "29152": "Would she ever die?",
  "29153": "And had the leather interior lasted with the felt cap through seven centuries?",
  "29154": "But why should anyone take it in order to keep it in his house?",
  "29155": "What will happen now?",
  "29156": "Next, how can the posting be accomplished in these mountainous parts?",
  "29157": "Does your soul belong to him now?",
  "29158": "How is man to know?",
  "29159": "And what can I do for you, esteemed prince?",
  "29160": "But this letter in which he recommends you to me?",
  "29161": "What are bulbs?",
  "29162": "Would you like to ferry me over?",
  "29163": "I hope your respected father is well, sir?",
  "29164": "And what, my lord, has been my fault?",
  "29165": "Then what is the illness itself?",
  "29166": "Is that what you've been so funny about this evening?",
  "29167": "But you are half asleep, are you not?",
  "29168": "Of whom?",
  "29169": "And suppose I were to die?",
  "29170": "I wonder where they do go, by the by?",
  "29171": "Is the well where you got this water near at hand?",
  "29172": "And does your honor know the four men who undertook to rescue him?",
  "29173": "Did you still hear the knocking?",
  "29174": "But to what place was I to go?",
  "29175": "Would you work for four and a half a week?",
  "29176": "You have a child?",
  "29177": "Doesn't the name of the country strike you even in the mere mention of it?",
  "29178": "How shall we punish him for such a speech?",
  "29179": "What can be plainer than that the webbed feet of ducks and geese are formed for swimming?",
  "29180": "The sun?",
  "29181": "Diana?",
  "29182": "But who was she?",
  "29183": "Have you been in others?",
  "29184": "How died he?",
  "29185": "She asked, if she should call me again?",
  "29186": "You won't mind, will you?",
  "29187": "Have you been there long?",
  "29188": "Do I interrupt?",
  "29189": "But it is quite understood, is it not?",
  "29190": "Will you carry him?",
  "29191": "Neither will he ever break faith where there have been oaths or agreements?",
  "29192": "If he comes back again, father?",
  "29193": "But who can tell what had happened?",
  "29194": "What then, I shall be asked, prevents these things from taking place with such regularity and precision?",
  "29195": "Who is the lady?",
  "29196": "Ain't it good enough to be in your book?",
  "29197": "And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?",
  "29198": "Is it not a just retribution?",
  "29199": "And where are the bodies?",
  "29200": "What do you say to coffee?",
  "29201": "Then we are friends?",
  "29202": "What are you thinking of, D'Artagnan?",
  "29203": "It was four years ago that I had it made, and what do you think I chose for the word and figures?",
  "29204": "Can I have missed it?",
  "29205": "Krajiek could 'a' put it there, couldn't he?",
  "29206": "WHICH candle?",
  "29207": "Shall we take their horses out, or tell them to find friends elsewhere as they best can?",
  "29208": "How much longer will you stay here?",
  "29209": "Is yours a hooky or a nobbly?",
  "29210": "And if he were innocent of any wrong, why did he not do something to clear himself?",
  "29211": "And it is to you, you graceless varlet, I owe all this?",
  "29212": "I have spoken of this because I keep wanting to know for a fact whether other people feel such enjoyment?",
  "29213": "Who is the fellow with him?",
  "29214": "And what will happen now?",
  "29215": "Can we be so unwise as to mean, that she shall keep a navy in our harbours for that purpose?",
  "29216": "Well, I don't think there's anything more, is there?",
  "29217": "Do you think that you are going to stay here?",
  "29218": "Are you going away, or has something happened?",
  "29219": "At the point where the path passes through the gate, you could surely pick up the tracks?",
  "29220": "What have we for lunch?",
  "29221": "Then it's a go, eh?",
  "29222": "What is't?",
  "29223": "Because she was there?",
  "29224": "Can you, of all the people who love her, bear to see her so?",
  "29225": "And if we had not arrived, what would you have done?",
  "29226": "Should you like me to take down his hat to him?",
  "29227": "Honest?",
  "29228": "Are all the flowers dead, or do some of them come again in the summer?",
  "29229": "Can one work there?",
  "29230": "Doing?",
  "29231": "I mean, will you be good to us, or do you intend to eat us?",
  "29232": "Will there be roses?",
  "29233": "Who gives you your maintenance, I pray you?",
  "29234": "What makes you pant so, my friend?",
  "29235": "Is it his fault that he is so ugly, and has so little sense?",
  "29236": "And what due or proper thing is given by cookery, and to what?",
  "29237": "Leave him there after what has occurred this morning in this palace?",
  "29238": "Do you take me vor a shicken ?",
  "29239": "Wot good are you?",
  "29240": "What are you to do?",
  "29241": "And why do you ask that?",
  "29242": "What is it, grandmother?",
  "29243": "What's the good of stopping?",
  "29244": "Had I right, for my own benefit, to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations?",
  "29245": "Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?",
  "29246": "You will reach that with nothing to help you but credit?",
  "29247": "By whose means?",
  "29248": "How much do you own?",
  "29249": "And the lakes, cousin, what do you say of them?",
  "29250": "Why don't you go and fetch things?",
  "29251": "Is that possible?",
  "29252": "What do you mean by lagging and a lifer?",
  "29253": "Are there no honest ones?",
  "29254": "And what is THAT to me?",
  "29255": "Are you unwell today?",
  "29256": "Phips had compromised, and why not he?",
  "29257": "To the office?",
  "29258": "Why should he bear all this?",
  "29259": "Successfully, I hope?",
  "29260": "Have you not heard the astonishing intelligence regarding her surreptitious union?",
  "29261": "Yet, what have I got to do with it?",
  "29262": "Still he's not worth her little finger, is he?",
  "29263": "Is the baby all right?",
  "29264": "Has she been stolen?",
  "29265": "Why must she do it?",
  "29266": "And by what means our news to him repeat?",
  "29267": "What in the world was the meaning of this?",
  "29268": "Is it possible that this stranger has now become everything to me?",
  "29269": "Forgive me, won't you, and let me put the poor brute out of his misery?",
  "29270": "The question arises, what disposition are we to make of our accumulating funds?",
  "29271": "Is it of any use for me to tell you again why we must try to part with the house?",
  "29272": "How comes it that you would not answer my greetings for so long?",
  "29273": "And what did the firm say?",
  "29274": "You do think I could do some good at it, if I were to try?",
  "29275": "But what is to be done, old man?",
  "29276": "As they are or as they appear?",
  "29277": "I didn't do wrong, did I?",
  "29278": "What do I want with them?",
  "29279": "Where is that secretary person?",
  "29280": "What could he do, even supposing himself strong enough to fight the battle?",
  "29281": "Can one be too much alive, too happy?",
  "29282": "Who are to be the objects of popular choice?",
  "29283": "But will not the general be too hospitable for you?",
  "29284": "And that's the lad, sir, is it?",
  "29285": "Which road?",
  "29286": "And me?",
  "29287": "Oh, so it's not time to die yet?",
  "29288": "And how is it he has got this power over you, that you promise to marry him against your will?",
  "29289": "How could the devil from hell himself escape alive?",
  "29290": "Why don't you leave him alone?",
  "29291": "And why so late returned?",
  "29292": "What about leaving that bright boy of yours on guard?",
  "29293": "Did ye ever know this?",
  "29294": "Are you content, my beloved?",
  "29295": "Ye that tell us of harmony and reconciliation, can ye restore to us the time that is past?",
  "29296": "If they had said I was niece to a piping bullfinch, what would you care?",
  "29297": "Have you served under the usurper?",
  "29298": "You would want nothing for so doing?",
  "29299": "What's injudicious, hey?",
  "29300": "Who of you heard his evil song?",
  "29301": "On you?",
  "29302": "Why have you come?",
  "29303": "What have I ever known?",
  "29304": "How many times do I love again?",
  "29305": "Then I may reckon on it, your excellency?",
  "29306": "You have heard me?",
  "29307": "You're the son of one and the nephew of the other?",
  "29308": "And at what date?",
  "29309": "Is he to go up for examination?",
  "29310": "Old lady?",
  "29311": "Have you found it?",
  "29312": "Isn't there any help for it?",
  "29313": "Who speaks for this cub?",
  "29314": "Is it not very unwise in us to go on spending the little money we've got when I can keep down expenditures by an honest occupation?",
  "29315": "What ought they to be allowed, or not allowed, to do, be, and suffer?",
  "29316": "How long have you been there?",
  "29317": "Do you wish for a name?",
  "29318": "But what, miss?",
  "29319": "And you never by any chance lose sight of him, I presume?",
  "29320": "Should we go now?",
  "29321": "How is one to vanish partly?",
  "29322": "Who was it that was eaten?",
  "29323": "Can I have another piece?",
  "29324": "Where is the use of the devil in that sentence?",
  "29325": "Whereabouts?",
  "29326": "It is awful, love, isn't it?",
  "29327": "Yet how can I let this knavish dog die and lose the money?",
  "29328": "Or how bear the expense of such a journey?",
  "29329": "I am to drag my present life on, holding its pains at your pleasure, day by day?",
  "29330": "One and all?",
  "29331": "And will the inspection have to be made now?",
  "29332": "You do not understand?",
  "29333": "Always ready?",
  "29334": "Can you get a few men together to go there?",
  "29335": "Shall we allege a musical dispute?",
  "29336": "Is it riveted to the planks?",
  "29337": "What, then, possessed him?",
  "29338": "Have you got it?",
  "29339": "Do you believe you have still a certain amount of it to expend this evening?",
  "29340": "Won't anything make you understand that?",
  "29341": "Wouldn't you rather sit here?",
  "29342": "Then why in the world not?",
  "29343": "What are they then?",
  "29344": "What can you love me for?",
  "29345": "Is he a presentable sort of a person?",
  "29346": "Why do you talk like this to THEM?",
  "29347": "But what was his name?",
  "29348": "What do you mean by gone?",
  "29349": "But why don't you want to take it?",
  "29350": "Is not it what you have often wished to do yourself?",
  "29351": "Would a boat be waiting for us with supplies and letters?",
  "29352": "What must have been his feelings?",
  "29353": "And shall we ever come into our own again?",
  "29354": "What do you want, my pretty?",
  "29355": "Supposing him to be attached to me, would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?",
  "29356": "But suppose she had run against this piece of iron?",
  "29357": "Who will be the jury?",
  "29358": "You think, then, that you can help me more efficaciously than your brothers?",
  "29359": "And do you think it's true?",
  "29360": "Shall there never be a fresh opportunity of trying the ranges of projectiles?",
  "29361": "Did he wake up?",
  "29362": "Was he nice?",
  "29363": "And now what will we do?",
  "29364": "Do you not know?",
  "29365": "Or, perhaps, you are not unprepared for the announcement I have it in charge to make?",
  "29366": "And if that were the case would your honor condemn his action?",
  "29367": "And during these days what shall I do?",
  "29368": "Don't the knives hurt?",
  "29369": "Where have you come from and what is your name?",
  "29370": "But how shall we get back?",
  "29371": "How many of the zechins, your father saved, are still left?",
  "29372": "What are your additions?",
  "29373": "What are the foundations of inequality?",
  "29374": "How did you get it?",
  "29375": "One of those swabs, was he?",
  "29376": "Do you believe he can?",
  "29377": "Who has seen her?",
  "29378": "What did he mean by such a pagan idea?",
  "29379": "Was it because at that time we passed for very rich people, and you were afraid of being refused?",
  "29380": "And besides, what have I done to bring it about?",
  "29381": "Alas, what shall I wretched wight become?",
  "29382": "But suppose it's a woman?",
  "29383": "Why am I to give an account of myself?",
  "29384": "What's that you tell me?",
  "29385": "But you think she wouldn't come?",
  "29386": "What colorable reason could be assigned, in a country so situated, for such vast augmentations of the military force?",
  "29387": "Is this too little?",
  "29388": "For the last three months?",
  "29389": "What could he reply to the deposition of the gendarmes who had arrested him in the very act?",
  "29390": "Where is thy answer, culprit?",
  "29391": "Should a man be considered disgraced because he is deceived, because he is betrayed, robbed?",
  "29392": "You are recovering again?",
  "29393": "What are you blurting out NOW?",
  "29394": "Shall we yield to force?",
  "29395": "Come, I do not ask for the sake of questioning you, but how did you get in?",
  "29396": "What do you wish, gentlemen?",
  "29397": "What does she?",
  "29398": "What, then, is the use of your worship?",
  "29399": "Was the gate open?",
  "29400": "Shall us begin it now?",
  "29401": "A recruit, sir, I understand?",
  "29402": "Sir?",
  "29403": "Yet could a woman who had done even what she had done deserve all this?",
  "29404": "But who would do it?",
  "29405": "Has not your father already his sixth wife?",
  "29406": "I ask, is it not as good a rule for him as it is for me?",
  "29407": "WHAT do you call him?",
  "29408": "Who is coward now?",
  "29409": "Have they nothing better to do?",
  "29410": "But that's remarkably altruistic of you, isn't it?",
  "29411": "Are you feeling any better?",
  "29412": "Do you think I care more for my dress than for my little girl?",
  "29413": "What man of taste and feeling can endure rifacimenti, harmonies, abridgments, expurgated editions?",
  "29414": "Faucheux?",
  "29415": "And do you think that you would be happy with her, or she with you, after what has passed?",
  "29416": "Do you ask their pardon of me?",
  "29417": "Who can possibly have told you I had had that dream?",
  "29418": "And this is the return you make me for all the indulgences I've heaped on you?",
  "29419": "Why not raise it five more?",
  "29420": "Will you let me tell you?",
  "29421": "You allow me?",
  "29422": "A week?",
  "29423": "And yet what else was she to think?",
  "29424": "Say, was my mother rightly slain or not?",
  "29425": "But where is this devotion?",
  "29426": "Where have I got one?",
  "29427": "Does not that content you?",
  "29428": "And what is the difference?",
  "29429": "Why are you merry?",
  "29430": "If you really cannot come to me will you let me come to you?",
  "29431": "What matters it of whom he spoke?",
  "29432": "What did it matter if the message were not intended for him?",
  "29433": "Was ever a respectable gentleman in such an impasse?",
  "29434": "Peas?",
  "29435": "You won't forget how fond you are of me?",
  "29436": "What's the matter now?",
  "29437": "Where is this great spider of yours now?",
  "29438": "What have you done now?",
  "29439": "Did you see nobody concealed while you were there?",
  "29440": "Besides what have we to do with setting the world at defiance?",
  "29441": "It looks as if you were trying to fleece me?",
  "29442": "But why suspect me before the action?",
  "29443": "And you live here?",
  "29444": "What mean you?",
  "29445": "That's good impartial evidence, ain't it?",
  "29446": "Do you think for one moment that this little haystack is enough to feed all the flocks in the whole district?",
  "29447": "What is there more astonishing in all that I have said to you than in what you have told me?",
  "29448": "You will not help me, then?",
  "29449": "Surely you have gone too far?",
  "29450": "But I don't exactly see how we can do that?",
  "29451": "Why should he do it?",
  "29452": "But don't you think she'll know all about it, just the same?",
  "29453": "What is the business you wish to see her about?",
  "29454": "Is there anything more?",
  "29455": "Would you deprive me of one of the most indispensable of my means of livelihood?",
  "29456": "Why, how is this?",
  "29457": "What have made you so down?",
  "29458": "And where may he be now?",
  "29459": "The last time that I see him?",
  "29460": "What is her secret?",
  "29461": "Isn't there some nice girl who'd read and amuse you?",
  "29462": "Have you made this trip before?",
  "29463": "Doesn't that satisfy you?",
  "29464": "I say, stranger, how are ye?",
  "29465": "Is not this so?",
  "29466": "How long were you there?",
  "29467": "Wherein?",
  "29468": "Where, may I ask?",
  "29469": "Who is in this world?",
  "29470": "Doesn't join in with the lads in their games, to get some sort of excitement in this lonely place?",
  "29471": "Well, I wait patiently, do I not?",
  "29472": "Shall I have a cab called?",
  "29473": "And then your negotiations will fail?",
  "29474": "It looks newer than the other things?",
  "29475": "She what?",
  "29476": "Should you like me to stay away?",
  "29477": "What had I to do with him that he should rob me of my sleep?",
  "29478": "Will master come here a moment?",
  "29479": "Can there be an appearance of that which has no form?",
  "29480": "Shall we not?",
  "29481": "Where are you going, you rogue?",
  "29482": "And you are very happy?",
  "29483": "You won't have anything?",
  "29484": "Whither shall I bear my shame?",
  "29485": "What's up, then?",
  "29486": "Of what use are excursions into realms in which no real fruit can ever be gathered?",
  "29487": "And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth?",
  "29488": "But why these workingman's clothes?",
  "29489": "And pray what is the ether?",
  "29490": "But there was some one there?",
  "29491": "Have you already in your mind a plan wholly or partially formed?",
  "29492": "Does he gamble?",
  "29493": "And you are certain that the queen and he did not see each other?",
  "29494": "Shall I go up and see?",
  "29495": "What have they come there to do?",
  "29496": "Do you know I think them exceedingly entertaining and strange?",
  "29497": "Will you let me take your arm as far as my own door?",
  "29498": "How's your wound?",
  "29499": "Did you not say that the dog's name was Z?",
  "29500": "Of what use are these dangerous visits, since we can't recognize him?",
  "29501": "You are the officer on duty, lieutenant of the musketeers, are you?",
  "29502": "Who said anything about killing?",
  "29503": "For the emperor's return?",
  "29504": "Can't you see you've made a mistake?",
  "29505": "Can we safely base our action upon any such vague inference?",
  "29506": "Did tha' do anythin' extra to make thysel' so strong?",
  "29507": "Or do ye go in bare bones, as I may say?",
  "29508": "Now, what is the evidence presented to this body by one of its committees?",
  "29509": "Liza, do you despise me?",
  "29510": "Come, are you ready?",
  "29511": "Has she ever had any experience?",
  "29512": "What does he want, then?",
  "29513": "Are you tired of me?",
  "29514": "And why should it be set aside?",
  "29515": "You see?",
  "29516": "Is not that the empress with him there?",
  "29517": "We only want to find out whether it is yes or no, don't we?",
  "29518": "For everything?",
  "29519": "Is it in anger or in spite that you wish to go?",
  "29520": "Paid everybody?",
  "29521": "Will the greedy gullet of the penitentiary be satisfied with swallowing him instead of all of them, if they should venture to obey him?",
  "29522": "You will come and see me again before you go, chevalier?",
  "29523": "Why should you say such desperate things?",
  "29524": "You must promise me you'll tell no one else?",
  "29525": "It isn't putting you out or upsetting your plans, I hope, or anything on those lines?",
  "29526": "What's that?",
  "29527": "Not here?",
  "29528": "Birdsburg?",
  "29529": "The count, then, is in the chateau?",
  "29530": "What did you go to the bandstand for?",
  "29531": "But what do you mean by living only for yourself?",
  "29532": "Why, know you not?",
  "29533": "Don't you love me?",

  "29545": "What will they leave him?",
  "29546": "How can I cross the desert?",
  "29547": "How did you get the idea?",
  "29548": "You were going to drink my wine?",
  "29549": "What's 'cordeon?",
  "29550": "Will you let me?",
  "29551": "Meet?",
  "29552": "Where are you going to next?",
  "29553": "Would it not be so, mother, if we were to meet him in fact?",
  "29554": "Are you going to walk with me a little way?",
  "29555": "Will she find an excuse for the neglect of the knight in the duty of a soldier?",
  "29556": "Why should he shun it?",
  "29557": "Who is safe, if she be convicted of crime?",
  "29558": "Or who so safe from injury as the brother of the great?",
  "29559": "But where did you gather your wisdom?",
  "29560": "What's become of him?",
  "29561": "Do you guarantee it?",
  "29562": "When shall I have done weeping?",
  "29563": "And will she go about in a plain shawl, and a large straw bonnet, carrying tracts and bone soup to her husband's poor parishioners?",
  "29564": "How's the cream of clerkship, eh?",
  "29565": "Can't you wait until dark?",
  "29566": "But what the devil are you hurrying about?",
  "29567": "Are you afraid?",
  "29568": "Why impossible?",

  "29596": "What about this umbrella?",
  "29597": "But why, silence?",
  "29598": "Scott?",
  "29599": "Who has it?",
  "29600": "Do you think me an utter fool?",
  "29601": "You remember what a beautiful night it was?",
  "29602": "In life?",
  "29603": "Not as a waiter?",
  "29604": "How did you proceed?",
  "29605": "Had it been all his fault?",
  "29606": "Who are you, and why do you seek me?",
  "29607": "Where I put it?",
  "29608": "A'n't I a lonely, forlorn widower?",
  "29609": "What were they doing, and why did they not instantly give the alarm?",
  "29610": "What happened before?",
  "29611": "Then he studied it over and said, couldn't I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl?",
  "29612": "Why will you look at matters in so unfriendly a light?",
  "29613": "Have you asked her?",
  "29614": "Darling one, will you be drawn?",
  "29615": "Who knows?",
  "29616": "And how did the thing happen?",
  "29617": "Will it do us any good, mother?",

  "29620": "Can I help showing that I know what she told me?",
  "29621": "Do you side with him in this?",
  "29622": "Perhaps you would prefer being alone?",
  "29623": "Where were his flatterers now?",
  "29624": "Must I move on, sir?",
  "29625": "And he deceived you, and then deserted?",
  "29626": "Or would it worry you just now?",
  "29627": "Does she say anything about him?",
  "29628": "In the queen's name?",
  "29629": "But how can you expect her to keep her promises better than her more enlightened mistress?",
  "29630": "Is she coming again?",
  "29631": "Which shall it be?",
  "29632": "Danecamp?",
  "29633": "Or, when the monarchy is a child, where then is the wisdom?",
  "29634": "Can she give lessons in anything?",
  "29635": "May the testimony of a whole people be slighted, my master?",
  "29636": "Nervous about you?",

  "29645": "Do I look fit to be seen with this little brooch?",
  "29646": "Is the reward of virtue bread?",
  "29647": "And will the minister be there?",

  "29651": "How do I mistake it?",
  "29652": "And how many days will make a month?",
  "29653": "What is that line?",
  "29654": "Of what good is it to recall the semblance of life when I cannot recall the spirit?",
  "29655": "And he did not complain?",
  "29656": "And that?",
  "29657": "And what shall be their education?",
  "29658": "But who are you, pray?",
  "29659": "When did he refuse you anything?",
  "29660": "You will not be so foolhardy as to keep your promise?",
  "29661": "DO I remember her?",
  "29662": "What wonder, then, that his imagination should fail to realise the changes that eight years must have worked?",
  "29663": "But you will love him, papa?",
  "29664": "Is it because the sun is declining to the horizon?",
  "29665": "Do you require my services now?",
  "29666": "So you didn't get it?",
  "29667": "She does play well, doesn't she?",
  "29668": "Does not this comprehend all, in fact?",
  "29669": "See you no difference between my charms and those of other women?",
  "29670": "But what is the danger?",
  "29671": "And have you no remedy for this?",
  "29672": "Have you not seen how shamelessly she favors your rival's suit?",
  "29673": "Shall we bury it again?",
  "29674": "He must have bewitched her, I suppose?",
  "29675": "Why not accord to both equal property?",
  "29676": "Is he a bishop, then?",
  "29677": "Who knows?",
  "29678": "Will you not trust me so far as that?",
  "29679": "Will that be possible?",
  "29680": "McMurdo?",
  "29681": "Fifty pounds?",
  "29682": "You are one of the shipwrecked sailors of the BRITANNIA?",
  "29683": "Can he be dead?",
  "29684": "One hallucination might pass, but two hallucinations?",
  "29685": "Is she there still?",
  "29686": "About this boy, love, in whose company they say you left?",
  "29687": "And the work of the painter is a third?",
  "29688": "Ginger?",
  "29689": "Have you realized what the verdict at the inquest will be?",
  "29690": "You think I speak from wicked selfishness?",
  "29691": "Is HE safe for an hour or two?",
  "29692": "Did not you think him sadly out of spirits?",
  "29693": "Wasn't she joking?",
  "29694": "And, if the footpath is narrow, do you think one woman would make room for another, or would beg pardon as she sweeps by?",
  "29695": "Really, if the lower orders don't set us a good example, what on earth is the use of them?",
  "29696": "Laws, now, is it?",
  "29697": "And who is that young man beside you?",
  "29698": "Of what importance is the manner, monsieur, in which I have learnt what I know, so that I know it?",
  "29699": "Is it the personal and individual element in us, or the spiritual and universal?",
  "29700": "Why, where was the difficulty?",
  "29701": "Who deluded you?",
  "29702": "If the virtuous should be very few in number, how then shall we act?",
  "29703": "But to what family does it belong?",
  "29704": "You don't believe me?",
  "29705": "Who shall gainsay your decision?",
  "29706": "Can't you read?",
  "29707": "Will you walk this way, ma'am?",

  "29715": "What of the letter?",
  "29716": "But my direction will not be the same as yours, I think?",
  "29717": "Or if we admit a disinterested benevolence in the inferior species, by what rule of analogy can we refuse it in the superior?",
  "29718": "You find the rent too high, do you, sir?",
  "29719": "Then you permit me to go, you are not angry in your heart?",
  "29720": "Has he solved the problem of population?",
  "29721": "Do you despise me for it?",
  "29722": "The count himself?",
  "29723": "Are these waters, then, bare of inhabitants?",
  "29724": "If a layman in giving baptism pour the water before saying the words is the child baptized?",
  "29725": "And about your fits?",
  "29726": "You say you don't?",
  "29727": "Can you spare the time?",
  "29728": "And, in the next place, when called to account for it, did he not disobey their summons?",
  "29729": "What did you come for, then?",
  "29730": "Shall I swear to you, sir?",
  "29731": "What you thinking about?",
  "29732": "Or are they swayed and perverted by the sophistries of worldly policy?",
  "29733": "There isn't a cat in it, for example?",
  "29734": "But could not the cavity be detected by sounding?",
  "29735": "You damned rascal, where do you always hide it?",
  "29736": "What would you have done?",
  "29737": "Have you the secret of that combination?",
  "29738": "Your marriage, you say?",
  "29739": "You DO?",
  "29740": "Why did you force me to leave it?",
  "29741": "But who killed her?",
  "29742": "You have asked for me?",
  "29743": "Can you put me up here, and spare a few days to the strangest business, I promise you, that ever was recorded in fact or fiction?",
  "29744": "Have you ever seen such a creature?",
  "29745": "What makes you believe this?",
  "29746": "What is there so improbable in it?",
  "29747": "Well, what do you say?",
  "29748": "And what besides?",
  "29749": "You know not?",
  "29750": "Was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night?",
  "29751": "What are they then?",
  "29752": "What horror can this be?",
  "29753": "Oh, how can you?",
  "29754": "Furious?",
  "29755": "And you paid him out of the two hundred francs I left you?",
  "29756": "One side of WHAT?",
  "29757": "After all, when one can see stars and skies like that, little disappointments and accidents can't matter so much, can they?",
  "29758": "What was this paper which was stolen?",
  "29759": "Whose horse?",
  "29760": "But where did he come from?",
  "29761": "What was to say or do now?",
  "29762": "Had the doctor anything new to tell you?",
  "29763": "Have you any friends?",
  "29764": "What can be done, thus?",
  "29765": "Fits?",
  "29766": "Now take my arm, will you?",
  "29767": "Can you fly?",
  "29768": "Or of what use is it that this immensity of worlds is visible to man?",
  "29769": "A man mistrustful of everybody?",
  "29770": "Do you think me dupe enough to believe you have not comprehended what it meant?",
  "29771": "Do I know?",
  "29772": "Especially, what do they resemble, if they are born to enjoy life, and feel its blessings?",
  "29773": "Are yer, cocky?",
  "29774": "How shall I get him out of the house?",
  "29775": "Where is your dispatch?",
  "29776": "What, have you sold all your clocks?",
  "29777": "I suppose you angered him somehow?",
  "29778": "Half way to what?",
  "29779": "Do you know what this is to me?",
  "29780": "And seeing that the thing is so easily done, why do not more people attempt it?",
  "29781": "Who knows but I may?",
  "29782": "Even then what would have been the use of it, seeing that life is to be measured, not by a single hour, but by years?",
  "29783": "Where are the gentlemen?",
  "29784": "What's happened?",
  "29785": "Ne'er a one to be found now?",
  "29786": "And for what?",
  "29787": "Hark you, sir, have you dispatch'd this same?",
  "29788": "Come here much?",
  "29789": "But what shall I say?",
  "29790": "To speak to you about me?",
  "29791": "How are things with you?",
  "29792": "Do you not see that it is with religion as with governments, the most perfect of which would be the denial of all?",
  "29793": "When do you sail?",
  "29794": "Where is the water, wife?",
  "29795": "Why should they brighten their tomahawks and sharpen their knives against each other?",
  "29796": "Where did you get these pearls?",
  "29797": "Disgrace the whole regiment because of one scoundrel?",
  "29798": "And we didn't do better than many another reg'ment, did we?",
  "29799": "What's troublin' you?",
  "29800": "Did you suppose we are so vulgar as to use money here?",
  "29801": "The boat brought you word, I suppose?",
  "29802": "Why are you gentle, strong, and valiant?",
  "29803": "On foot?",
  "29804": "Is it not too?",
  "29805": "What, I suppose you think I don't know you?",
  "29806": "How can what he and you said be untrue?",
  "29807": "Is it that you won't come in because you wish to stand here, and think over the past hours of enjoyment?",
  "29808": "But what of that?",
  "29809": "Were we not brought up together?",
  "29810": "Can I bear the consciousness that every endearment he bestows is a sacrifice made on principle?",
  "29811": "Why do you torment me about what you might all see?",
  "29812": "But what do you do on active service?",
  "29813": "Carried off?",
  "29814": "Yes, brigadier?",
  "29815": "Writes for the stage, does he?",
  "29816": "And wherefore were you called away just now?",
  "29817": "How do you find them?",
  "29818": "Where did it come from?",
  "29819": "And do not the natures of men and women differ very much indeed?",
  "29820": "Who was not his friend who had heard him speak once?",
  "29821": "What could I say to them?",
  "29822": "I hope we have not tired you?",
  "29823": "Capitally, warmly said, wasn't it?",
  "29824": "Well, and then?",
  "29825": "You do not find it easy to advise me?",
  "29826": "Is that, in truth, worthy of thanks?",
  "29827": "Come and take a walk, my dear?",
  "29828": "Do you really not know?",
  "29829": "You'll be on hand tomorrow at one o'clock, won't you?",
  "29830": "Why should I risk an imprudent step?",
  "29831": "How are we to remember our valour and train our skill?",
  "29832": "Husband cross?",
  "29833": "Oh, then you know that the king has arrived?",
  "29834": "What business are you in now?",
  "29835": "But if she were really dead, what was there of terror in the idea of killing her?",
  "29836": "Why didn't you tell me before?",
  "29837": "Won't you have a drop of vodka?",
  "29838": "Is he worth his keep?",
  "29839": "Can I do you any good?",
  "29840": "There was another woman here?",
  "29841": "What made you stay away so long?",
  "29842": "Why are there no cucumber sandwiches?",
  "29843": "For, indeed, who is there alive that will not be swayed by his bias and partiality to the place of his birth?",
  "29844": "Don't I avoid the society of women?",
  "29845": "My orders have been carried out?",
  "29846": "Any success?",
  "29847": "Has your majesty forgotten that the king expects your reply and awaits it in agony?",
  "29848": "Are they arrangements that couldn't possibly be altered?",
  "29849": "It is a wound that confines him to his bed?",
  "29850": "Is that the way to behave to chief galleys?",
  "29851": "How were these double claims to ceremonious respect happening at the same time to be managed?",
  "29852": "What is to be done?",
  "29853": "You dirty scoundrel, is this the way you leave me?",
  "29854": "Would the interior acclivities of the crater be practicable?",
  "29855": "Where is this wedding to take place, and when?",
  "29856": "Is it the physical differences of blood, color and cranial measurements?",
  "29857": "Tell me, is my father living?",
  "29858": "Why do you look so amazed?",
  "29859": "An ape or a man?",
  "29860": "My dear, am I perfectly hideous?",
  "29861": "What is it that you mean?",

  "29873": "To go running after servant girls?",
  "29874": "Where are they now?",
  "29875": "Can these things be?",
  "29876": "Is it flowers you are strewing?",
  "29877": "Why don't you stay down town and go to the theatre with me?",
  "29878": "Would you call one of them virtue and the other vice?",
  "29879": "And you met no one?",
  "29880": "Didn't you notice it?",
  "29881": "Numerous?",
  "29882": "But you feel solitude an oppression?",
  "29883": "She's her brother's heir, is she not?",
  "29884": "When do we hear of women, who starting out of obscurity, boldly claim respect on account of their great abilities or daring virtues?",
  "29885": "But where is the old man?",
  "29886": "You recollect that first night, when I was so unpolite and inky?",
  "29887": "But if you will come and live with me, papa?",
  "29888": "You think there is no hope?",
  "29889": "Do you wish to go there?",
  "29890": "Are we all ready?",
  "29891": "What do you want to rush out for this way?",
  "29892": "You don't deny that?",

  "29900": "Then where does the vanity come in?",
  "29901": "But what were you to do with that woman?",
  "29902": "What does that signify, so long as they favor your suit?",
  "29903": "Do you want to stay here all day?",
  "29904": "Have you a pen?",
  "29905": "What's to become of me?",
  "29906": "What is a power, but the ability or faculty of doing a thing?",
  "29907": "Is it?",
  "29908": "Now, was there ever, since men emerged from a state of utter barbarism, an age in which there were no debts?",
  "29909": "There are whalers in these quarters, then?",

  "29912": "And twisted it into thread?",
  "29913": "Where was he sitting?",
  "29914": "A setback?",
  "29915": "You will call me sister, will you not?",
  "29916": "Had she heard aright?",
  "29917": "Did we reach any goals?",
  "29918": "Whither was it going?",
  "29919": "And, suppose I should wish to be married to the man that I love?",
  "29920": "Did these men arrive here voluntarily or involuntarily, by disembarking on the shore or by being wrecked?",
  "29921": "Are you going too?",
  "29922": "Did you think there was nothing but evil at the bottom of them?",
  "29923": "What would she do?",
  "29924": "This vexes you?",
  "29925": "And what do I see here, monsieur?",
  "29926": "Why should she disappoint those expectations because of the imperious demands of a very highly excited boy?",
  "29927": "Good heavens, why should I?",
  "29928": "For an augury of good or evil?",
  "29929": "What is he doing?",
  "29930": "Why on earth should you doubt them?",
  "29931": "And are we convinced that all of them are generated out of opposites?",
  "29932": "He's got a pretty strong string round your father's leg, by what I hear, eh?",
  "29933": "Please, where ARE the crabs?",
  "29934": "If we had had provisions enough for months, how could we get out of the abyss into which we were being hurled by an irresistible torrent?",
  "29935": "May I ask how old he is, ma'am?",
  "29936": "Did you ever see her?",
  "29937": "But what on earth did she mean?",
  "29938": "What besides?",
  "29939": "And why do you stand there gaping?",
  "29940": "It wouldn't show on my eyes tomorrow, would it?",
  "29941": "Contempt, my friend?",
  "29942": "What's the right way to knock?",
  "29943": "Every mornin' do?",
  "29944": "And in what did that which has taken place concern you?",
  "29945": "What could that mean?",
  "29946": "You are her father?",
  "29947": "Are your wife and children destitute of a bed to lie on, or bread to live on?",
  "29948": "What will he do?",
  "29949": "Why disgrace me before the army?",
  "29950": "You came seeking me to make to me certain proposals, but did you make them?",
  "29951": "And why were you crying so just now?",
  "29952": "Then you can't protest the cheque?",
  "29953": "And will you get him first thing in the morning?",
  "29954": "What will you do with the light?",
  "29955": "Have you come up determined not to deal?",
  "29956": "You have heard and understood what your granddaughter has been saying, sir, have you?",
  "29957": "What could they desire beyond their liberty?",
  "29958": "Edlin?",
  "29959": "What shall we do with him?",
  "29960": "Is not thy common talk found aphorisms?",
  "29961": "I should like to deal him a blow, but can I actually do it?",
  "29962": "Do you know what time your father will be back?",
  "29963": "But who, then, is this assassin, this murderer?",
  "29964": "Why did he urge me so little about the princess?",
  "29965": "What is the meaning of their eternal care and worry?",
  "29966": "Were his eyes deceiving him?",
  "29967": "Why this ridiculous mania for affirming that every thing has been said, which means that we know all about mental and moral science?",
  "29968": "And you spoke to him?",
  "29969": "What's the trouble?",
  "29970": "Give who?",
  "29971": "Anything else?",
  "29972": "Are you mad enough to leave this house?",
  "29973": "How long have you been engaged in the practice of medicine?",
  "29974": "What of it?",
  "29975": "Then it will be our duty to select, if we can, natures which are fitted for the task of guarding the city?",
  "29976": "Why not end my misery now rather than drag out a few more wretched days in this dark pit?",
  "29977": "Why did you lend an ear to the temptings of friends?",
  "29978": "What do you understand of the affair?",
  "29979": "Are we to pass the night in the king's room?",
  "29980": "Not about money, I hope?",
  "29981": "Extraordinary, did you say?",
  "29982": "Why should you interfere?",
  "29983": "She doesn't know yet?",
  "29984": "Gania, what are you standing there for?",
  "29985": "But why, of all others, choose these?",
  "29986": "Ever so little did you say, gossip?",
  "29987": "Are you in need of soothsaying?",
  "29988": "An incendiary, then?",
  "29989": "To come at call?",
  "29990": "Have I time?",
  "29991": "Do they live?",
  "29992": "And this is all?",
  "29993": "So that the governor got rid of the dangerous and the crazy prisoner at the same time?",
  "29994": "You mean that you want to go away from me?",
  "29995": "Now, my friends, can the country be saved upon that basis?",
  "29996": "What, billing so sweetly?",
  "29997": "Well, then what of it?",
  "29998": "What would my islanders say when they heard their governor was going, strolling about on the winds?",
  "29999": "And in that case there's no reason on earth why you shouldn't go back?",
  "30000": "But, guardian, may we not hope that a little experience will teach him what a false and wretched thing it is?",
  "30001": "Have you told them to bring the horse?",
  "30002": "What are we doing?",
  "30003": "Well, did you see them fly?",
  "30004": "What are you up to?",
  "30005": "And that's why you trust him, eh?",
  "30006": "And what does he think of it?",
  "30007": "What sort of an education could they have got in the country?",
  "30008": "How do you go back?",
  "30009": "How old is your sister?",
  "30010": "Who are you, sir, and by what right do you touch this gentleman's papers?",
  "30011": "Were they in the tent?",
  "30012": "Some poaching case, no doubt?",
  "30013": "What is that for?",
  "30014": "On what occasion?",
  "30015": "But were there no reasons why I should avoid you?",
  "30016": "Would it not be of some assistance, if we knew of what substance it is composed?",
  "30017": "Mustn't it be splendid to be remarkable and have compositions written about you after you're dead?",
  "30018": "Had she only been guilty of silence as to his fate?",
  "30019": "Shall I take it down for you?",
  "30020": "What about, papa?",
  "30021": "But I suppose there is no fire?",
  "30022": "Why should she talk of her own unhappiness?",
  "30023": "The whole picture ruined, isn't it so?",
  "30024": "Am I not he that has been conquered?",
  "30025": "Surely you won't have to make another for me?",
  "30026": "Where do you suppose him to be?",
  "30027": "And what means are ours, of attaining the truth?",
  "30028": "You mean?",
  "30029": "Please, sir, be this note for you?",
  "30030": "Surely I can never have seriously written such a silly motto as that?",
  "30031": "Have you made up your mind when you shall be there yourself?",
  "30032": "Need it go on?",
  "30033": "What was going on in that mind which was so young and yet already so impenetrable?",
  "30034": "Couldn't he have some spark of manhood about him?",
  "30035": "What shall become of this?",
  "30036": "But how was this to be done, when he had no revenue, often not means enough for necessary expenses?",
  "30037": "What steps have you taken?",
  "30038": "But what's the name of your chief?",
  "30039": "And now?",
  "30040": "What was that they said?",
  "30041": "Why should any one murder a man in so clumsy a fashion as by hanging him?",
  "30042": "Stands the wind in that quarter?",
  "30043": "Is it really true, what every one says, that you cut off one of the ogre's arms?",
  "30044": "Should he knock as of old?",
  "30045": "Nothing about the silver calabash he spat into?",
  "30046": "But what availeth it?",
  "30047": "Where then lay the spots of commonness?",
  "30048": "That seems strange to you, doesn't it?",
  "30049": "Who will volunteer for the job?",
  "30050": "How do we stand in point of time, constable, eh?",
  "30051": "Did I not promise?",
  "30052": "Well, who said it was?",
  "30053": "I suppose your people all do this?",
  "30054": "Did anyone send you, sir?",
  "30055": "What then do you know?",
  "30056": "But where could a dog have come from?",
  "30057": "What shall I do with this beastly tumbril?",
  "30058": "Do I excuse her for it?",
  "30059": "Who is it that compels them to borne along?",
  "30060": "Did any of you gentlemen want to have it out with ME?",
  "30061": "Am I not a madman, and therefore irresponsible?",
  "30062": "How am I afraid of myself?",
  "30063": "Where am I?",
  "30064": "Did he before?",
  "30065": "Do you want her?",
  "30066": "To what, then, do we owe these blessings?",
  "30067": "Runic?",
  "30068": "I say, shall we soon be clear?",
  "30069": "Slid, sir, what should you behold in my face, sir, that should move you, as they say, sir, to ask me, sir, if I would sell my rapier?",
  "30070": "Am I worth anything now, since you have got into such high favor?",
  "30071": "Will nothing make you understand?",
  "30072": "And are thy deeds so good?",
  "30073": "This young cavalier, who won't have me?",
  "30074": "Tell me would you rob?",
  "30075": "Ah, it's you?",
  "30076": "What more can the devil do than strangle us?",
  "30077": "Anything more?",
  "30078": "What does it matter, when you come to think of it, whether a child is yours by blood or not?",
  "30079": "I passed you on the road?",
  "30080": "And what makes you think?",
  "30081": "Is he come back, then?",
  "30082": "Is their race extinct?",
  "30083": "Why do you cast those anxious looks on each other?",
  "30084": "Finished what, may I ask?",
  "30085": "Why, they say, is he not perfect in his training?",
  "30086": "Just now, don't you find something uncomfortable, disquieting, alarming in the atmosphere of this room?",
  "30087": "Njal went on to ask, whether he had a right of action against all of them, or whether the leaders had to answer for them all in the suit?",
  "30088": "Will you swear it?",
  "30089": "Does your excellency wish for a receipt?",
  "30090": "What experiment?",
  "30091": "How can varieties of soil engender a principle of legislation and politics?",
  "30092": "What do I know about business?",
  "30093": "But what must they deserve, then, who set him to work?",
  "30094": "But why?",
  "30095": "What would you like best to do?",
  "30096": "Meditatin', eh?",
  "30097": "Next time you roust me out, you hear?",
  "30098": "But it's not serious?",
  "30099": "We knew you were going to get married, did we?",
  "30100": "Why make a long story of what took but five minutes to do?",
  "30101": "Why with disgust?",
  "30102": "What mill?",
  "30103": "What evil spirit has taken possession of your heart that you should be so wicked?",
  "30104": "Whether a profound genius, or a sure judgment?",
  "30105": "Why should you love me?",
  "30106": "Will not the landholder know and feel whatever will promote or insure the interest of landed property?",
  "30107": "Have you heard of her good fortune?",
  "30108": "These bodies serve us?",
  "30109": "Hippolyte?",
  "30110": "Tell me, do you love me?",
  "30111": "Are you angry with me?",
  "30112": "And if they were glad to have you, why should I have brought you away?",
  "30113": "Chopin's style, then, was not original?",
  "30114": "Do you desire me to go?",
  "30115": "Will that moderation be aided or impaired by the addition of a sovereign?",
  "30116": "What d'ye think the old fornicator saith?",

  "30219": "Can I speak with him?",
  "30220": "And to feel not exactly dull, but sad?",
  "30221": "Was it near, was it far?",
  "30222": "Wouldn't you, ferryman, like to accept these clothes, which are a nuisance to me, from me?",
  "30223": "Isn't he?",
  "30224": "Neither, I said, can there be any question that the guardian who is to keep anything should have eyes rather than no eyes?",
  "30225": "Damn it, did you then take me along with you for your chaplain, to sing mass and shrive you?",
  "30226": "You asked me for five hundred men, did you not?",
  "30227": "Your mother won't know, and so what's the harm?",
  "30228": "What is the liberty of the press?",
  "30229": "Would she throw away the inestimable advantage of royal protection?",
  "30230": "In whom can we trust?",
  "30231": "Then how is it that you did not go?",
  "30232": "And what reward have they?",
  "30233": "Shan't we try that?",
  "30234": "Would you care to try it?",
  "30235": "See what, sir?",
  "30236": "What else could I say when he asked me?",
  "30237": "Are you willing to carry us through the air wherever we wish to go?",
  "30238": "Suppose it was all a gigantic mistake?",
  "30239": "Why out of the question?",
  "30240": "Is your secret of enough importance to me to spare your life for it?",
  "30241": "Oh?",
  "30242": "What more can I desire?",
  "30243": "What would he say then?",
  "30244": "Where are these lamps?",
  "30245": "Who, mother?",
  "30246": "You are studying topography?",
  "30247": "What rent do you pay here?",
  "30248": "Now, do you want any more?",
  "30249": "Is there anything wrong?",
  "30250": "How could that be possible?",
  "30251": "Hadn't I better have a shave?",
  "30252": "How could angels bear the sight?",
  "30253": "You think it then possible that they really won't have returned?",
  "30254": "What's the answer?",
  "30255": "What do you mean by the proposal you made just now?",
  "30256": "I surmise you also are quits?",
  "30257": "What sort of wood is't?",
  "30258": "Can't any one make him stop?",
  "30259": "Do you consider me so?",
  "30260": "How do I know what I was before?",
  "30261": "Shall I see you again ere my departure?",
  "30262": "Am I alarmed?",
  "30263": "How long a start have they?",
  "30264": "In the second, whence comes it?",
  "30265": "What, monsieur?",
  "30266": "Didn't ye hear a word about them matters and something more, eh?",
  "30267": "Till at last he be?",
  "30268": "And what was there in a simple curl of fair hair to appall that brutal man, familiar with every form of cruelty?",
  "30269": "In love with HER?",
  "30270": "But we would agree to make him rich enough to live, I suppose?",
  "30271": "Would a tablespoon of vanilla be enough for a small layer cake?",

  "30277": "How do you do, dear friend?",
  "30278": "Have you got the key, auntie?",
  "30279": "What's a captive?",
  "30280": "Can that, with any sort of justice, be styled a blunder?",
  "30281": "But may I not write a note to tell him why I cannot come?",
  "30282": "Meanin' aour packets?",
  "30283": "Why did he do it?",
  "30284": "Has his housekeeper gone too?",
  "30285": "What do you like?",
  "30286": "You have observed that?",
  "30287": "She and I were like sisters, and now she is gone, will you not let me be like a sister to you in your trouble?",
  "30288": "And is there any opposite to life?",
  "30289": "Well?",
  "30290": "Don't you think that people are most conceited of all about their sensual powers?",
  "30291": "What am I to do if I love nothing but fame and men's esteem?",
  "30292": "What do you see there?",
  "30293": "How should a man tell you who knows everything?",
  "30294": "Of what did he die?",
  "30295": "The convicts?",
  "30296": "Why should I help a man to the means perhaps of winning all I have, unless I considered him my friend?",
  "30297": "Don't you know that their attorneys have noticed us that they have withdrawn the suit?",
  "30298": "Who was ever successful in true love?",
  "30299": "Don't you see that by the very fact of your choosing her you prove that you do not know what is best for you?",
  "30300": "Does he?",
  "30301": "Can't you take my word?",
  "30302": "Don't you feel it, don't you feel you CAN'T be tortured into any more knowledge?",
  "30303": "Why should we not get him?",
  "30304": "Ladislaw?",
  "30305": "Does he accept?",
  "30306": "Could it be possible that she should her have to encounter another amorous swain?",
  "30307": "If I catch him there again, shall I have the right to thrash him and her also?",
  "30308": "Is not this the time for us to go back?",
  "30309": "Very reserved, isn't he?",
  "30310": "Ha, what?",
  "30311": "If so, whose?",
  "30312": "And what do you want to do now?",
  "30313": "And the windows too?",
  "30314": "But do you know, gentlemen, what was the chief point about my spite?",
  "30315": "Is there anything the matter, father?",
  "30316": "How do you cure the shivers?",
  "30317": "You have lost one of your boots?",
  "30318": "How comes it that he is unknown?",
  "30319": "What sort of a man is that?",
  "30320": "You have been into the church?",
  "30321": "Is it so beautiful as all that?",
  "30322": "Well, what are you doing there, then?",
  "30323": "Are you used to burglary, may I ask?",
  "30324": "Can't I come back to your rooms?",
  "30325": "And you are NOT, I presume, eh?",
  "30326": "I wonder why?",
  "30327": "Would he come and see her in spite of his mother?",
  "30328": "Wouldn't you rather come in here, to me?",
  "30329": "And what did they see?",
  "30330": "What sort of lives do the majority of folk lead?",

  "30347": "And who are the really clever men, after all?",
  "30348": "For what other reason can you have laid your plans to talk in this way to such a woman as I am?",
  "30349": "It may come to that, that we must leave this place, but till that time comes, why should your young days be clouded?",

  "30368": "Then what would you like to do until your uncle comes back?",
  "30369": "If you can't see it yourself, why try to debar me?",
  "30370": "Bless the girl, what are you shivering about?",
  "30371": "Said he, and stamped with his foot, am I to be questioned thus by such a one as you?",
  "30372": "Then where is he?",

  "30399": "Will you be my ally, my lady?",
  "30400": "Now then, where's your chief's quarters?",
  "30401": "Is that an aphorism or a cliche?",
  "30402": "What meaneth this restless wagging of her slouchy chaps?",
  "30403": "It gives a lonely man a sort of hankering, doesn't it?",
  "30404": "Ain't you afraid of it, sir?",
  "30405": "And anything else?",
  "30406": "You really won't meet the rest of them?",

  "30419": "No, never?",
  "30420": "Has the whelp been playing that game long?",
  "30421": "Is there no mission in thy native land, O planeticose and exallotriote spirit?",
  "30422": "Would we make any office hereditary that required wisdom and abilities to fill it?",

  "30431": "Yes, she's as good as they make 'em, and she's all the female I possess and spoiled in consequence, aren't you, old girl?",
  "30432": "What do you know?",
  "30433": "What then could I against the will of heaven?",
  "30434": "Will you allow me to whisper half a syllable, sir?",

  "30436": "Would you like a cup of tea?",
  "30437": "In this state of the case, my friends, why is the country agitated?",
  "30438": "You are rich, then, I suppose?",
  "30439": "But how about the tennis?",
  "30440": "Did he mean that literally?",
  "30441": "But tell me, has your father had you entered on the registers of his phratria?",
  "30442": "Hadn't you better say two fifty?",
  "30443": "If the infected were removed, why not mention it?",
  "30444": "Which is it to be?",
  "30445": "Then he will no more have true opinion than he will have knowledge about the goodness or badness of his imitations?",
  "30446": "You have seen him?",
  "30447": "What men are safe if this is done?",
  "30448": "Does she think so?",
  "30449": "Why don't you ask him?",
  "30450": "Does it hurt to be invis'ble?",
  "30451": "You don't think I do it because I like it, do you?",
  "30452": "Is that correct?",
  "30453": "Girl number twenty, isn't this a prosperous nation, and a'n't you in a thriving state?",

  "30459": "Should you also like to be maid of honor?",
  "30460": "What discovery?",
  "30461": "What shall we do with our sleds?",
  "30462": "What big house is that just ahead, please?",
  "30463": "What will you do with yourself for the time?",
  "30464": "You have kissed the queen's hand?",
  "30465": "But when will that come to pass?",
  "30466": "Will you promise?",
  "30467": "Why do you give me this shame?",
  "30468": "Its name?",
  "30469": "I say, why have you been so rotten since I came back?",
  "30470": "On what subject shall I converse with her?",
  "30471": "Have you taken any precautions?",
  "30472": "You have unmasked this false prince also?",
  "30473": "Were you walking in your sleep?",
  "30474": "Won't you love me?",
  "30475": "Are you aware, sir, that we have gone to enormous expense to resist this iniquitous attempt of yours?",
  "30476": "Will you hold the horse while I stick them on?",
  "30477": "Well, then, I must go?",
  "30478": "Is it the solitary cell you want?",
  "30479": "An't you cold?",
  "30480": "Have you anything to say?",
  "30481": "You were not surprised, I dare say?",
  "30482": "How can I help laws?",
  "30483": "You could not tell vs if his sonne were there?",
  "30484": "Do you mean to say you don't hear anything?",
  "30485": "Who is his master?",
  "30486": "No garters?",
  "30487": "What is it that you think I shall do?",
  "30488": "What, you here too, prince?",
  "30489": "What in the world was this hall used for?",
  "30490": "Who would believe him?",
  "30491": "Offended me, boy?",
  "30492": "You know how to support losses?",
  "30493": "What were they doing now?",
  "30494": "I guess you'll mind your parts o' speech, and study the ACCIDENCE agin afore you let your clapper run arter that fashion, won't you?",
  "30495": "Then we should be able to ascertain if the BRITANNIA had left any traces of her shipwreck there?",
  "30496": "What are you going to flog that man for, sir?",
  "30497": "What is he going to do?",
  "30498": "Must we always kill the people?",

  "30502": "I'm going to be good, but can't you be good running round just as well as sitting still?",
  "30503": "How can we prevent that?",
  "30504": "Can't we go overside a piece?",
  "30505": "Might I come some other day?",
  "30506": "Go for a soldier, do you mean?",
  "30507": "But what did the mere reckoning of years matter when he felt as young in heart as he had been twenty years ago?",
  "30508": "How could a garden be shut up?",
  "30509": "Your wife or your daughter?",
  "30510": "So that you could see he knew what was between the two wretches?",
  "30511": "But who is there in the world that can boast of having fathomed or understood the wavering mind and unstable nature of a woman?",
  "30512": "Did you ever behold streets so insufferably narrow, or houses so miraculously tall?",
  "30513": "How can they know?",
  "30514": "Is it to make me a captain?",
  "30515": "What IS the matter with it?",
  "30516": "Would that surprise you?",
  "30517": "But would he come?",
  "30518": "How do you know I was praying, sir?",
  "30519": "Who looks after the sick here?",
  "30520": "Can'tyou walk yet?",
  "30521": "Who can make him out?",
  "30522": "To whom do I address it?",
  "30523": "But where was mine?",

  "30526": "How could you possibly know that?",
  "30527": "Why so insensible to my uncle's interests?",
  "30528": "And the possibility has been acknowledged?",
  "30529": "Your ruin?",
  "30530": "Do you mean in point of reward?",
  "30531": "But how long have you been here that you are ignorant of all this?",
  "30532": "Haven't you put a drop of poison in that remark now, eh?",
  "30533": "Would there ever come to him a time of freedom?",
  "30534": "Will you bear, therefore, will you bear to see your sanctuary trampled on?",
  "30535": "Even if the squire should afterwards hear of his having been there, what would it matter?",
  "30536": "She said I was prudent and virtuous?",
  "30537": "How are you to get away from here?",
  "30538": "You are confident that the thief came in a cab?",
  "30539": "That's what it always comes to, doesn't it?",
  "30540": "What could he want?",
  "30541": "That was something in this way, warn't it?",
  "30542": "Why not have kept hold of it with both hands, with both knees, when it was about to flee from her?",
  "30543": "But to what does all this lead?",
  "30544": "Hasn't she always you?",
  "30545": "How do the bass chords run?",
  "30546": "Shall I send the servant to direct you?",
  "30547": "How much is the whole?",

  "30549": "Do you know anything of his history?",
  "30550": "Was she ever as pretty as my mother is now?",
  "30551": "But the puzzle is, who are the teachers?",
  "30552": "How could you be cruel to me?",
  "30553": "But well carried out, eh?",
  "30554": "How did you fare?",
  "30555": "Who does it come from?",
  "30556": "What happened within her?",
  "30557": "Whom had he to consult but himself now?",
  "30558": "What differences from terrestrial conditions will ensue?",
  "30559": "Isn't there a lot of hope in it?",
  "30560": "What stable?",
  "30561": "Do I look ugly?",
  "30562": "To relieve thy breast?",
  "30563": "Can you lift me into that tree and put a rifle in my hands?",
  "30564": "Shall I tell you what you were thinking to yourself just then?",
  "30565": "But what can I have to relate to you?",
  "30566": "Why is that woman always out of the way when she is most wanted?",
  "30567": "I hope you don't mind?",
  "30568": "What right had they to make me suffer like that?",
  "30569": "How long do you suppose this sea to be?",
  "30570": "Do you desire it as ardently as you say?",
  "30571": "If nature suddenly should give that beast a tail, would he not be prouder of it than all the other foxes in the wood?",
  "30572": "Watch and listen, won't you, so that you can give me your impression after the first act?",
  "30573": "Who could have said so the evening before?",
  "30574": "Very good?",
  "30575": "Are you likely to be more humane to me than others were yesterday?",
  "30576": "Was it my imagination that there was an undertone of fear rather than of hope in the question?",
  "30577": "What could have caused it?",
  "30578": "Is he a scholar, or a soldier?",
  "30579": "And to confer upon me the favour of your distinguished recommendation?",
  "30580": "How can he keep him?",
  "30581": "Surely you have felt that it is so?",
  "30582": "Could there be a development of knowledge in the absence of curiosity?",
  "30583": "Do the old fellows bother you?",
  "30584": "If what?",
  "30585": "And how have you been getting on?",
  "30586": "But you, sir?",
  "30587": "Did you see?",
  "30588": "Who is your favorite author?",
  "30589": "You think this old monkey in here knows what you say?",
  "30590": "What would you gain by it?",
  "30591": "You've been picking the flowers, hey?",
  "30592": "But are you so sure, so very sure of her?",
  "30593": "If I get your grandpa to apologize for the shaking, will you give up running away?",
  "30594": "Who's here?",
  "30595": "Don't you think that this has lasted long enough?",
  "30596": "Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring?",
  "30597": "And it is asked by what authority this bold and radical innovation was undertaken?",
  "30598": "I asked him upon this if he ever disputed with his wife?",
  "30599": "Sirrah, who gave you a commission to lie in my lordship?",
  "30600": "How can I tell?",
  "30601": "How could I let him?",
  "30602": "But do you suppose I carry five hundred francs about with me?",
  "30603": "What hand and brain went ever pair'd?",
  "30604": "Why did you write me such a horrid letter, you naughty boy?",
  "30605": "Or can I ever see one?",
  "30606": "Quite?",
  "30607": "What is she vexed with him about?",
  "30608": "To do that, my joy?",
  "30609": "And later?",
  "30610": "Will you malign your native realms and reduce them to a level with the country upstairs?",
  "30611": "But what language is it?",
  "30612": "Wouldn't YOU?",
  "30613": "Lucy dear, do you know why I tell you all this?",
  "30614": "How did they come to love each other?",
  "30615": "But what are you going to do to repay us for the past?",
  "30616": "Are you in a position to tax the nation to the extent of four hundred million dollars?",
  "30617": "Got any views on the subject?",
  "30618": "Of the duke?",
  "30619": "What means all this?",
  "30620": "Will you stay here if the enemy occupies the place?",
  "30621": "For how shall I be able, said he, to rule over others, that have not full power and command of myself?",
  "30622": "Go?",
  "30623": "Have I deserved to be called an elderly person?",
  "30624": "Is it because we are calculated to walk?",
  "30625": "Why ask about the next but one?",
  "30626": "Can we have the butler in for a moment?",
  "30627": "Wasn't it good of him?",

  "30629": "Who suffers by his ill whims?",
  "30630": "Do you hear the news?",
  "30631": "Is there any one who understands human and political virtue?",

  "30633": "What did she see there?",
  "30634": "The postilion?",
  "30635": "What ancient nation, as the same author asks, can be named that was originally monogamous?",
  "30636": "What can I do to do myself justice upon her?",
  "30637": "Your letter is like you, and what could I say of it that would be higher praise than that?",
  "30638": "You would not be cruel to me?",
  "30639": "Is everything here purple?",
  "30640": "Do you think we did well in using the adder's fat?",
  "30641": "When to be made payable?",
  "30642": "Is she married, my dear?",
  "30643": "Anyone about?",
  "30644": "Oriental?",
  "30645": "Are we going to see the court?",
  "30646": "So why should he have made such a sacrifice?",
  "30647": "Hrut asked him what news?",
  "30648": "What accursed philosophy stands in your way?",

  "31565": "Odd, wasn't it?",
  "31566": "Have you ever really loved anybody?",
  "31567": "Or that night, when I frowned at him?",
  "31568": "With the prince still?",
  "31569": "And a young lover come and carried off the bride, eh?",
  "31570": "Who hindered his coming to the house?",

  "31622": "Was there not a spirit in him which, silent as it was, burned on him like the fires of perdition?",
  "31623": "Hurt you?",
  "31624": "What visions, they asked, could one but read them, must lie behind the quiet, dreaming eyes of that inscrutable face?",
  "31625": "What resources could they expect to find upon that scene of desolation?",
  "31626": "May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?",

  "31653": "Haven't you given her any warning of your arrival?",
  "31654": "It stung you up a bit when I spoke of your game leg, young fellow?",
  "31655": "Sire, will you allow me to speak frankly as befits a loyal soldier?",
  "31656": "Then why speak to me about it?",
  "31657": "What the devil do I do?",
  "31658": "Who would ever know?",
  "31659": "Well, but they'll see how small you are afterwards, won't they?",
  "31660": "Was I very gleeful, settled, content, during the hours I passed in yonder bare, humble schoolroom this morning and afternoon?",

  "31679": "YOU insulted ME?",
  "31680": "Will you come along home wi' me, and see my wife?",
  "31681": "And now, matey, did that doctor say how long I was to lie here in this old berth?",
  "31682": "My companion?",
  "31683": "For how can one?",
  "31684": "Game for a morning drive?",
  "31685": "You know where you left the team?",

  "32312": "But, unscrew your navel, and what's the consequence?",
  "32313": "You often think you know me as I really am?",
  "32314": "But where am I wandering to?",
  "32315": "Was the other one lost by a whale?",
  "32316": "Why do you doubt your senses?",

  "32338": "We can't send for the whole medical faculty, can we, to treat your gout?",
  "32339": "Why, that way?",
  "32340": "Have you put the lunch in?",
  "32341": "How then had he been able to explain, and in such language, the number of things that he could not have said so well before?",
  "32342": "What, is it right?",
  "32343": "Well, and how do you do?",
  "32344": "And the king?",
  "32345": "Am I not already in the grave?",
  "32346": "Don't you see how the water boils and bubbles?",
  "32347": "What shall I say to him first?",
  "32348": "What promise?",

  "32353": "How long you been this way?",
  "32354": "But all this entails expense, and upon whom is this to fall?",
  "32355": "Is this the origin of the zodiacal light?",
  "32356": "With such alternatives, what would be the fate of the travelers?",
  "32357": "Is the fracture recent?",
  "32358": "Now are you ready to tell, boys?",
  "32359": "Have you so much ingratitude and injustice to give credit, against your friend, to the aspersions of two such mercenary trulls?",
  "32360": "I suppose you have a garage there?",
  "32361": "That would meet the situation?",
  "32362": "Was this well done, young gentleman?",
  "32363": "You haven't heard about the school, I suppose?",

  "32380": "I have caught you, have I?",
  "32381": "What are they talking about, and why doesn't he go back?",
  "32382": "Hadn't you better take up some line where they'll come in handy?",
  "32383": "Yes, that's it, she means to elope with him, but what am I to do?",
  "32384": "Leave tonight?",
  "32385": "What would you throw out?",
  "32386": "How would you like being kept awake for an hour in the middle of the night because her ladyship wouldn't go to sleep?",

  "32397": "Why does he want them?",
  "32398": "Broughton, just get a policeman, will you?",
  "32399": "Would he succeed in coming face to face with the girl he was seeking?",
  "32400": "Whatever do you mean?",
  "32401": "And what went wrong?",
  "32402": "Yes honey, but what's the matter with you, precious?",
  "32403": "Will not the capture of one army after another satisfy him, must all become prisoners?",
  "32404": "How will they get at it?",
  "32405": "Expenses paid, and a moderate screw?",
  "32406": "Was she expecting a visitor?",
  "32407": "Thinks I, what does it mean?",
  "32408": "Were's it gorn?",
  "32409": "How's that?",
  "32410": "Now you, sir, will you answer me or not?",

  "32412": "Why don't I what?",
  "32413": "And what did he find?",
  "32414": "Is it sure promised?",
  "32415": "What is the trial for, when he is not here and will never return?",
  "32416": "What a shameful disorder in nature, is it not, to make war against women?",
  "32417": "Whereabouts will she be?",
  "32418": "Am I not your comrade?",
  "32419": "But, suppose we should rise up tomorrow and emancipate, who would educate these millions, and teach them how to use their freedom?",
  "32420": "And he has gone, you say?",
  "32421": "Would you go and be dependent on your friends?",
  "32422": "H'm, then you DO give him money?",
  "32423": "Is she, then, preparing for a stroke?",
  "32424": "Where should good news come from to me?",
  "32425": "Well, and what woman don't I should like to know?",

  "32445": "Did I not give express orders that I would have no smoking in the office?",
  "32446": "Alive?",
  "32447": "And yet what necessity was there for his having a regular master?",
  "32448": "And who on earth, after the daily experience we have, can question the probability of a gentleman marrying anybody?",
  "32449": "How did you get it?",
  "32450": "Cried the other 'Why are you pelting me?",

  "33344": "Were you at the performance last evening?",
  "33345": "How have you got on?",
  "33346": "Why had she allowed him to understand that he was master of her heart?",
  "33347": "Paying the money, I suppose?",
  "33348": "What then should I say, if I dared complain, I who am deprived of all who are dear to me?",
  "33349": "May one venture to ask you, monsieur, on what you have reflected?",
  "33350": "Are you, then, a coward?",
  "33351": "Would it not be safer and more certain if I should ask him his name and tell him yours?",
  "33352": "Why, how did he come here, mother?",
  "33353": "You'll get down, brother, won't you, and take something?",
  "33354": "Why do you say that, when you are going to this terrible war, and he is so old?",
  "33355": "Under what law, and for what offence?",
  "33356": "Easily?",
  "33357": "Why did he not take her in his arms and swear that he would never leave her?",
  "33358": "DID you hear that?",
  "33359": "Is the committee willing to hear this witness?",

  "33371": "How is your dear mother getting on?",
  "33372": "But you know how it all ended, don't you?",
  "33373": "Why did we choose it, this foolish task?",
  "33374": "Are you an alienist?",
  "33375": "Cannot ate it?",
  "33376": "You won't give it up?",
  "33377": "You are, I imagine, still of the same opinion?",
  "33378": "When are you going to be sensible, and think of your friends, and try and be a credit to them?",
  "33379": "Or not you so much, perhaps, as your friend in the city?",
  "33380": "Did you ask her how much?",
  "33381": "Is there no force on this side of the creek?",
  "33382": "If I guess rightly, will you confess it?",
  "33383": "Did you ever hear a definition of fame, sir?",
  "33384": "It is to be considered an honour, I suppose?",
  "33385": "Ay, but how shall we know the catchpole?",
  "33386": "What harm is there in that?",
  "33387": "Why are there men and women that while they are nigh me the sunlight expands my blood?",
  "33388": "Why, according to popular belief is it rather characterised by the very contrary?",
  "33389": "Shall we hold it as a province and govern it by despotic power?",
  "33390": "My dear doctor, what is my wife's complaint?",
  "33391": "Do we go all the way today?",
  "33392": "Oh, what does that matter?",
  "33393": "What place was there in her mind for a remonstrance to lodge in?",
  "33394": "Really and truly?",
  "33395": "If that were so, what had become of my father?",
  "33396": "But where is the last year's snow?",
  "33397": "How much will you ask to stay with her till the end?",
  "33398": "What can it be?",
  "33399": "Of whom are you jealous, now?",
  "33400": "What was the sense of that?",
  "33401": "I felt very ignorant, but what could I do?",
  "33402": "And what are you going to do with yourself now, if I may ask?",
  "33403": "What interest of hers was affected by the treaty?",
  "33404": "An order to who?",
  "33405": "Which is the stronger, the small stick that first PRODUCES the fire, or the fire itself?",
  "33406": "So you've been at the club?",
  "33407": "Don't you really?",
  "33408": "Has he been a good soldier except the desertion?",
  "33409": "Do you think not?",
  "33410": "Have you been looking for him, as I ordered?",
  "33411": "O, it an't?",
  "33412": "What you mought call me?",
  "33413": "Full of hope?",
  "33414": "And who will go?",
  "33415": "What is the news, whence is thy embassage?",
  "33416": "Farther?",
  "33417": "Should he slip away after having come and peeped into the barricade?",
  "33418": "Perhaps?",
  "33419": "Very well, my dear sir, and how does that concern us?",
  "33420": "But will the wild ass submit to the bonds?",
  "33421": "Where is the count?",
  "33422": "A whole one, and in a candlestick?",
  "33423": "Are you?",
  "33424": "Are you going to remain as you are, dear princess?",
  "33425": "What might have been your opinion of the place?",
  "33426": "Who defeated it?",
  "33427": "Plantation hand?",
  "33428": "For us, also?",
  "33429": "What is to be done with them?",
  "33430": "What would the life of a man be if he could feel no fear or repulsion?",
  "33431": "Is it really so that I may understand you, sir?",
  "33432": "Well, dad, what do you say about it?",
  "33433": "With what consolations can those, who have thus miscarried in their chief design, elude the memory of their ill success?",
  "33434": "Why did she love everything so tenderly and so passionately, everything living that was not a man?",
  "33435": "In favor of some member of your family?",
  "33436": "You are angry, monsieur?",
  "33437": "What, he told you so, I suppose?",
  "33438": "What, have they buried him in honour for his services to them?",
  "33439": "To stand from fear set free?",
  "33440": "When will they be required, sire?",
  "33441": "You are aware, I suppose, that all mythology and poetry is a narration of events, either past, present, or to come?",
  "33442": "Why do you go, sir?",
  "33443": "You called my father 'Michael' as if you knew him well?",
  "33444": "This DETOUR has been entirely for our benefit, then?",
  "33445": "What do you tell me?",
  "33446": "What was she like now?",
  "33447": "Call the captain, and heave the ship aback?",
  "33448": "And did you observe any change in her then?",
  "33449": "Flee alone, and leave you here?",
  "33450": "Can I have lost it?",
  "33451": "Are the sacrifices I have made of honour and modesty to you no proof of my being tied to you in bonds too strong to be broken?",
  "33452": "But what makes you so much out of sorts?",
  "33453": "Why, wherefore stay you?",
  "33454": "Who asked him while I was away?",
  "33455": "Don't you hear it?",
  "33456": "Jarndyce?",
  "33457": "Why, what's the matter?",
  "33458": "What does it depend upon?",
  "33459": "Now will you learn not to answer back when I speak to you?",
  "33460": "And what you think of it?",
  "33461": "But, on the other hand, did not the people evince decided obstinacy and insubordination?",
  "33462": "And my making it easy for you to see the child?",
  "33463": "Has anyone an interest in preventing your arrival there?",
  "33464": "Do you abuse your teacher?",
  "33465": "Has it struck you that we may not now choose to give over?",
  "33466": "And how do you like the place?",
  "33467": "Why do you not sit by his side and begin talking to him and asking him questions?",
  "33468": "You say papa will get better, and why shouldn't he?",
  "33469": "What have you got to be afraid of?",
  "33470": "What used he to say?",
  "33471": "Where the devil is mine?",
  "33472": "How do you feel yourself?",
  "33473": "That millions of others still exist, which are too minute for any observation?",
  "33474": "I suppose we might call her that?",
  "33475": "Don't you know that it is only very foolish folk who talk sense all the time?",
  "33476": "What's that to me?",
  "33477": "But you are sure you can act your part, and disguise your voice so that he may mistake that, as he has already mistaken your person?",
  "33478": "What would it matter if you smashed to smithereens at the end of the run, after a bust like that?",
  "33479": "Can someone have guessed our secret and dug up the watch?",
  "33480": "But what could he do but just let her see that he would make anything, everything, for her, as honourably easy as possible?",
  "33481": "How many cartridges did you say you had left?",
  "33482": "What then is worth being valued?",
  "33483": "What does this avail?",
  "33484": "This, then, was his father's residence?",
  "33485": "Fisher?",
  "33486": "Ain't there a small drop of something queer about that, eh?",
  "33487": "How like you that answer?",
  "33488": "But what shall we do?",
  "33489": "If it is a friend, why does he not show himself?",
  "33490": "Who then must decide?",
  "33491": "Can we with propriety suffer them to be rulers?",
  "33492": "Have you been here long?",
  "33493": "But why didn't you tell me?",

  "33496": "How do you prove that?",
  "33497": "Arsenic?",
  "33498": "Now, sir, what have you to say to me?",
  "33499": "I suppose we're going to have a talk about this?",
  "33500": "Let 'em both wait?",
  "33501": "Perhaps you would not mind walking to town with me?",
  "33502": "Love had bandaged his eyes, in order to lead him whither?",
  "33503": "It is not my intention to detain the reader by expa?",
  "33504": "Why ask?",
  "33505": "Am I to read this?",
  "33506": "Who are you then?",
  "33507": "Was there nothing to fear?",
  "33508": "But did this man hope to conceal himself effectually behind that heap of rubbish, which one need but skirt?",
  "33509": "Then it all depends on that object that you regard, for your reasons, as evidence?",
  "33510": "What if there was no rank of life in which she could now properly attach herself?",
  "33511": "Why then do philosophers look for public spirit?",
  "33512": "How many would he have?",
  "33513": "But do you know this mysterious count is a bachelor?",
  "33514": "Why strive for a coherent, satisfied life?",
  "33515": "You won't throw any more stones, will you?",
  "33516": "Intelligent you call yourselves, do you?",
  "33517": "Did men eat men?",
  "33518": "That is, he was not a boy at all, I suppose?",
  "33519": "I suppose you know he has an order for unlimited credit on the baron's banking establishment?",
  "33520": "Who knew what would have saved him?",
  "33521": "Could he not annul the verdict?",
  "33522": "How can something come out of nothing?",
  "33523": "And now, he said, what did we just now call that principle which repels the even?",
  "33524": "What is that error?",
  "33525": "What is this place?",
  "33526": "Guy, is this amount of confidence to be our stock to start the new life on?",
  "33527": "How is your head, better?",
  "33528": "What matters that?",
  "33529": "The opportunity is a good one, then?",
  "33530": "But if, in spite of all my precautions, I am at last obliged to fight, will you not be my second?",
  "33531": "May I ask you to be so kind as to inquire of all your subjects if any of them have seen a fishing hook lost in the sea?",
  "33532": "And what is your business?",
  "33533": "Had I better wait till it's three o'clock?",
  "33534": "Remember me, don't you?",
  "33535": "Aren't there really?",
  "33536": "Why are you not eating anything, gentlemen?",
  "33537": "But opals are unlucky, aren't they?",

  "33541": "Are you a married man, sir?",
  "33542": "What dream we of?",
  "33543": "What's the good of taking it in hand now?",
  "33544": "But if he does not come?",
  "33545": "Have you any idea what became of them?",
  "33546": "Are you the little girl that comes out with the lady an' four horses?",
  "33547": "And why this ABSOLUTISM in the relations of capitalist and laborer?",
  "33548": "Is any man termed a gentleman, that is not always in the fashion?",
  "33549": "Do I ever leave you?",
  "33550": "Are you all of the same opinion?",
  "33551": "Whose was this mighty personality?",
  "33552": "Perhaps you could name the figures of a few wiolincellers of a good tone?",
  "33553": "Why don't you take it?",
  "33554": "To marrying whom?",
  "33555": "Am I wrong to come up here to see her?",
  "33556": "You heard my question?",
  "33557": "Why now should I be tempted?",
  "33558": "I'm afraid I've given you a good deal of trouble, haven't I?",

  "33560": "You're able to read?",
  "33561": "What has he lived on since?",
  "33562": "And you resent it?",
  "33563": "Was it not rather a service and a kindly act?",
  "33564": "Won't that do as well?",
  "33565": "Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?",
  "33566": "How could there be when it's barely ten o'clock yet?",
  "33567": "And have you got a paper?",
  "33568": "Where is the girl who promised to marry any one who would release her brother?",
  "33569": "And all arithmetic and calculation have to do with number?",
  "33570": "How do you happen to be here?",
  "33571": "And what is the result?",
  "33572": "Don't you see that all this leads to comfort in the end?",
  "33573": "And for what have you ruined your life, if you come to think of it?",
  "33574": "Who talks of cadeaux?",
  "33575": "But did you not read that I must be alone?",
  "33576": "Do you find the prisoner guilty or not guilty?",
  "33577": "But what's happened to you?",
  "33578": "Are you lost or have the wolves eaten you?",
  "33579": "Yet why do tears blind my eyes?",
  "33580": "Why should I still be subject to these visitations of the devil, when I try so hard to keep him away?",
  "33581": "How do you know what I think?",
  "33582": "But why was the tear in her eye?",
  "33583": "Are you lonesome because you're a magician?",
  "33584": "What had taken place during those ten months?",
  "33585": "You accuse him, then?",
  "33586": "What has anybody to do with that?",
  "33587": "Why has the social instinct, so trustworthy among the animals, erred in the case of man?",
  "33588": "John, which way must we now turn?",
  "33589": "Was I not right?",
  "33590": "Why so breathless a start?",
  "33591": "And have we, at our age, been earnestly discoursing with one another all our life long only to discover that we are no better than children?",
  "33592": "Do you want to go with us?",
  "33593": "Who had taken the letters, if letters there were?",
  "33594": "At any rate, they are all reconciled to it now, I hope?",
  "33595": "And they will place them under the command of experienced veterans who will be their leaders and teachers?",
  "33596": "Even the spiritual vision, is it not at all points arrested by the continuous golden walls of the universe?",
  "33597": "What can you be dreaming of?",
  "33598": "You say again you are quite sure that it was the prisoner?",
  "33599": "Is it any new trouble?",
  "33600": "And talking about the hospital?",
  "33601": "Amid what elegancies of carved furniture, decorated walls, elaborate tapestries did they move?",
  "33602": "If they are really qualified for the task, will not their own hearts be the first to inform them of it?",
  "33603": "What sort of life were that to live?",
  "33604": "What's your trade?",
  "33605": "How could I have been so beguiled?",
  "33606": "How does I talk wild?",
  "33607": "Would we be done for?",
  "33608": "Come, now, my learned friend, what makes you hesitate?",
  "33609": "Why can't you wait?",
  "33610": "You have come far?",
  "33611": "But is she not awfully rich?",
  "33612": "Who can make good coffee?",
  "33613": "So we had better leave you?",
  "33614": "Is the downstairs door fast?",
  "33615": "Or if he is to be governed, how can he be governed well?",
  "33616": "Will you have tea here then, or go across to the house, where there's a tent on the lawn?",
  "33617": "Did you observe the colour?",
  "33618": "Nothing that can't be got over, perhaps, after all?",
  "33619": "Can it be?",
  "33620": "Will this assist in explaining the difficulty?",
  "33621": "Is not my son hungry?",
  "33622": "But you, my dear d'Artagnan, what has happened to you?",
  "33623": "You are sure of your enterprise?",
  "33624": "Have you been at the concert?",
  "33625": "What about her horse?",
  "33626": "Mamma, what am I to say to him?",
  "33627": "When is your turn to come?",
  "33628": "Had I thus come in vain into these forests and mountains?",
  "33629": "Do you call that nothing?",
  "33630": "What is it, then, which does judge about them?",
  "33631": "Shall I lend you a hand here?",
  "33632": "Damn you, what do you mean by that?",
  "33633": "And who's that tall chap standing beside her?",
  "33634": "Would any one deny this?",
  "33635": "And you didn't give him the oysters?",
  "33636": "Did they impose on each industry a proportional tax, so as to preserve a balance in the market?",
  "33637": "What should you do in my place?",
  "33638": "What more could one ask for?",
  "33639": "For who can change men's opinions?",
  "33640": "Have you decided?",
  "33641": "How is your father getting on?",
  "33642": "Were those great, stony cliffs the gates of paradise?",
  "33643": "Shall our rivers and harbors be improved?",
  "33644": "But how do you make it shine through the walls?",
  "33645": "What, do you want to leave us?",
  "33646": "Do you stand me out, mistress?",
  "33647": "If not, why should she not have answered his question?",
  "33648": "How is the poor woman?",
  "33649": "Or, that she should prefer the rant of flattery to the simple accents of sincerity?",
  "33650": "Are you a gentleman?",
  "33651": "How do yer see that?",
  "33652": "Did you speak?",
  "33653": "Shall I see you again before your departure?",
  "33654": "And how are the other people getting on?",
  "33655": "Whah did ye cum from?",
  "33656": "Why should I not go?",
  "33657": "And if they are not fortifying, sire?",
  "33658": "But hark, what music is that?",
  "33659": "What do you suppose they would do to a man disarmed like me?",
  "33660": "Are you really frightened, madame?",
  "33661": "What are you doing, you stupid creature?",
  "33662": "Who will undertake it, if it be not also a service of honour?",
  "33663": "What have you heard?",
  "33664": "But as for me, what solace had I when the days of my fighting were done?",
  "33665": "You were not unfortunate, and yet you are an orphan, fatherless and motherless?",
  "33666": "Would not that have been better evidence?",
  "33667": "Where was my head when I made that grant?",
  "33668": "Wherein, then, lay the resemblance that made the young man's heart beat with a kind of retrospective excitement?",
  "33669": "How will she take it?",
  "33670": "And you order me to announce you to the duchess?",
  "33671": "What more has happened?",
  "33672": "Why did you not tell me, instead of teasing me like this?",
  "33673": "Judah told you?",
  "33674": "So far we are within the bounds of possibility, are we not?",
  "33675": "Will the train soon be in?",
  "33676": "What is your opinion?",
  "33677": "How was it, having so little in reality to conceal, that I always DID feel as if this man were finding me out?",
  "33678": "But isn't there another thing to be done?",
  "33679": "What I wanted, who can say?",
  "33680": "Do you suppose I don't think about that myself?",
  "33681": "Where is thy victory?",
  "33682": "Oh come, now, you don't mean to let on that you LIKE it?",
  "33683": "And pray how do I and these my friends around me seem to you?",
  "33684": "Ah, are you composing poetry, queen?",
  "33685": "What is the use of being exquisite if you are not seen by the best judges?",
  "33686": "Then what was the use of our coming?",
  "33687": "Why do you disappoint me so?",
  "33688": "Are you a child or a teetotum?",
  "33689": "Take head?",
  "33690": "The date?",
  "33691": "Then, when your articled time is over, you'll be a regular lawyer, I suppose?",
  "33692": "Would I do him this favour?",
  "33693": "Do you mind if I go in and tell this man to come on to us when he's finished here?",
  "33694": "Is it in this particular part, or in that other?",
  "33695": "Haven't I seen you blowing as hot as you please?",
  "33696": "Are you ready to get back the trade on those terms?",
  "33697": "To what does your ambition aspire?",
  "33698": "And all complaining, accusing?",
  "33699": "Is she like me?",
  "33700": "What, none of you?",
  "33701": "I am not blushing, for I don't think I need blush about it, need I?",
  "33702": "You will fulfill your promise to me?",
  "33703": "What sort of animal is this interest?",
  "33704": "You must have known that?",
  "33705": "Was it not I?",
  "33706": "And am I dishonest?",
  "33707": "What's the letter?",
  "33708": "Would it please you to accompany her upon the lake?",
  "33709": "Ladies and gentlemen, what is your opinion on the subject?",
  "33710": "What do you want, sir?",
  "33711": "And where can a man seek ends of any sort beyond this broad field?",
  "33712": "How came you to make such a mistake as this?",
  "33713": "Is it too late?",
  "33714": "How do you feel now?",
  "33715": "Anne, did YOU put sugar in these peas?",
  "33716": "That is to say, justice is useful when money is useless?",
  "33717": "Is not this second infinite, so to speak, subjacent to the first?",
  "33718": "And he said nothing as he died?",
  "33719": "WHO forbade you?",
  "33720": "Gallia out of place?",
  "33721": "And am I not ready to do so again?",
  "33722": "Frightened of what?",
  "33723": "Where do we go first?",
  "33724": "Where are you?",
  "33725": "How did you get yourself into this mess?",
  "33726": "It is not in your possession?",
  "33727": "Will your excellency give your name, or remain incognito?",
  "33728": "If I kept that little girl in my mind for five years, didn't I earn some part in her?",
  "33729": "Legal proceedings to prevent payment?",
  "33730": "Have you any sort of conveyance?",
  "33731": "I suppose you kissed his hand?",
  "33732": "What's in it?",
  "33733": "How dare you look into this garden?",
  "33734": "How find a straight road of progress, you men of science, of industry, of cooperation, of trades unions, and all the rest?",
  "33735": "Really?",
  "33736": "Is this gentle and lovely being lost forever?",
  "33737": "Wouldn't you?",
  "33738": "Weigh out tragedy, like butcher's meat?",
  "33739": "Happy?",
  "33740": "What mingles in the strain?",
  "33741": "What can that be, monsieur le chevalier?",

  "33743": "What, to buy gingerbread?",
  "33744": "Have the fugitives been pursued?",
  "33745": "Is he likely to marry, uncle?",
  "33746": "Not even a sou?",
  "33747": "What did he want?",
  "33748": "Of course it is very different here, but who knows how long it will last?",
  "33749": "Do you ever try to read your own face?",
  "33750": "No accident has happened to him?",
  "33751": "Yea, truly, saw ye not birdlime upon his hands?",
  "33752": "What have you to do with us?",
  "33753": "What's his name?",
  "33754": "Why, then, I would ask, do we see these lengthened shadows, which follow in the course of our political day?",
  "33755": "And how are they all?",
  "33756": "Larrey?",
  "33757": "Is this his house?",
  "33758": "Don't you think you might find some affairs there, ma'am, to interfere with?",

  "33789": "Hain't you got no principle at all?",
  "33790": "Why did I not fall in love with her then and propose to her?",
  "33791": "I suppose you've got your thumbs?",
  "33792": "Just's?",
  "33793": "And how long were you in the hole?",
  "33794": "What, all sons of silence, no spirit?",

  "33801": "Babies?",
  "33802": "Where did you address your letters, then?",
  "33803": "You know what they say?",
  "33804": "The first question is, of what nature was her communication?",
  "33805": "Why are you wandering about like an outcast?",
  "33806": "But, miss, you will hear one word?",
  "33807": "Does the count know what answer you received?",
  "33808": "Is, then, the woman, who holds out to the bitter end in her desire to have the last word, in so far virtuous?",
  "33809": "Shall we return to the camp?",
  "33810": "Query, ought it not, in strict grammar, to be injecerit, instead of infecit?",
  "33811": "Then you are giving it up?",
  "33812": "And do ye carry your flock bed, and your quilt, and your crock, and your bit of chiney?",
  "33813": "Is there anything else that puzzles you?",
  "33814": "Would you leave our village, desert our homes and fly before an enemy approaches?",
  "33815": "What are you to her?",
  "33816": "I expect you're feeling very 'appy today, sir?",
  "33817": "What could your ladyship propose by it?",
  "33818": "Who, then, has more luck than I have?",
  "33819": "When did they cease to be so?",
  "33820": "And what did you detect, if not gratitude?",
  "33821": "Speak I soothly, men of greenwood?",
  "33822": "Could misunderstanding be more complete, or sympathy worse misplaced?",
  "33823": "But what made her do that?",
  "33824": "But where will he touch?",
  "33825": "Now what will you take?",
  "33826": "Rupert?",
  "33827": "Do you think to overawe us by this?",

  "33878": "What is the good of the ear if it tells you the same as the eye?",
  "33879": "Perhaps you do not wish to accept my proposition?",
  "33880": "And you repent already?",
  "33881": "An answer?",
  "33882": "Come now, that's the great thing?",
  "33883": "Was it to be in church?",

  "33889": "Well enough to question him in that language?",
  "33890": "But what's the meaning of it all?",
  "33891": "Then do you know what I did?",
  "33892": "Might I crave your favour to carry my name to him, and say I beg to say a word in his ear?",
  "33893": "Ah kin you tell wether I've a soul or not?",
  "33894": "What money?",
  "33895": "Is your tobacco perfumed, servant, that you swear by the sweet smoke?",
  "33896": "Could any thing worse be said of property?",
  "33897": "How could it be any other way?",
  "33898": "It is then so near the end?",
  "33899": "Do you know this gentleman?",
  "33900": "May I submit your theory of managing soldiers to a slight test?",
  "33901": "And you mean to tell me that I have been wrong?",

  "33931": "Have you come home to be married?",
  "33932": "But how can they think so?",
  "33933": "You are sure a severe chill isn't hereditary, or anything of that kind?",
  "33934": "What think you of that, my daughter?",
  "33935": "Seems you have been out after such?",
  "33936": "Was it not a direct menace against the work which he and his companions had till now conducted so successfully?",
  "33937": "For which side?",
  "33938": "Do you remember what I told you last time?",
  "33939": "What further commands has my lord?",
  "33940": "What have you seen?",
  "33941": "Not play?",
  "33942": "You are not ashamed of the face that has done so much?",
  "33943": "Every word?",
  "33944": "And next, shall we enquire whether the kindred science also concerns us?",
  "33945": "Reproaching you for what?",
  "33946": "Are we not still masters of our own swords?",
  "33947": "Will ye come up here?",
  "33948": "Then why don't you say so, and let the girl put away the things, instead of keeping her waiting all morning?",
  "33949": "And then?",
  "33950": "Do you care for him?",
  "33951": "Do you think that I would tell you a falsehood about it?",
  "33952": "Will that do, or is it too genteel?",
  "33953": "Is there no devil to help me?",
  "33954": "You think it's possible?",
  "33955": "Well, you know what I am here for, don't you?",
  "33956": "The hanging?",
  "33957": "How can he go about making acquaintances?",
  "33958": "But now what are your plans?",
  "33959": "Supposing he did win a couple of hundred, wouldn't he be in it?",
  "33960": "Will you, I ask once more, show your belief in me by letting me clasp you with my arm?",
  "33961": "Kiesewetter?",
  "33962": "Was there ever such a blockhead, that can't tell the difference between jest and earnest?",
  "33963": "Don't anybody live there?",
  "33964": "Hope he'll see her?",
  "33965": "Is it, then important?",
  "33966": "Did you really?",
  "33967": "What reason?",
  "33968": "I wonder what's the reason?",
  "33969": "How could they fail to see how they were ruining themselves, lowering their prestige by this appointment?",
  "33970": "And don't you occupy yourself at all?",
  "33971": "Will he continue to give lectures in virtue?",
  "33972": "Why do you flee?",
  "33973": "They ask me, are they to light the candles that have been lighted before or candles that have never been lighted?",
  "33974": "And whose should you say it was?",
  "33975": "On whom did it depend?",
  "33976": "What would you think of me if I came down two hours after every one else and ordered grilled bone?",
  "33977": "What is it, gentlemen?",
  "33978": "Suppose I refuse?",
  "33979": "Can't ye see the world where you stand?",
  "33980": "That young girl whom they were abducting was not to be brought back?",
  "33981": "An't you happy?",
  "33982": "Would that be your way of speaking?",
  "33983": "But if he doesn't return?",
  "33984": "Must they be taught always to be pleasing?",
  "33985": "What advice did he give?",
  "33986": "With what ideas does that letter inspire you?",
  "33987": "What, pray, do you fear?",
  "33988": "Why, what do they DO to her, man?",
  "33989": "Have I got you all straight?",

  "33993": "They had lost twenty years, but what had they gained?",
  "33994": "Why did I not die?",
  "33995": "If you could have her?",
  "33996": "Does the man generally sleep like this?",
  "33997": "What can I do better in the interval between this and the setting of the sun?",
  "33998": "Do personal relations lead to sloppiness in the end?",
  "33999": "And you, being a good man, can pass it as such, and forgive and pity the dreamer, and be lenient and encouraging when he wakes?",
  "34000": "What means the woman?",
  "34001": "Should he descend and make a race for the distant cliffs, or should he hide here until night?",
  "34002": "But what are your intentions?",
  "34003": "Would that make his fortune?",
  "34004": "But about the time when he should drive the cattle homewards, who should he see coming but a great giant with his sword in his hand?",

  "34027": "Can you not clear up the last point in this mystery, and tell us the reasons for your action?",
  "34028": "We have made the circuit of our satellite, then?",
  "34029": "Monsieur is jealous, is he not, sister?",
  "34030": "But, I ask, what is meant by contingent?",
  "34031": "Was it their colours?",
  "34032": "Chaw?",
  "34033": "Why did she not take out her ships and insist on going with him?",
  "34034": "How do you get in?",

  "34181": "Then whom, ARE you talking about?",
  "34182": "You mean that this demands explanation, do you not?",
  "34183": "Can it be a song of joy?",
  "34184": "Did it move, did it float on the surface of the ocean, or did it dive into its depths?",
  "34185": "Reasonable well, I give you thanks, wont you alight?",

  "34288": "Do with him?",
  "34289": "And what may his name be, coptain?",
  "34290": "You might have stayed away, I suppose, if you would?",
  "34291": "Brown, convicted of mutinous conduct and sentenced to death?",
  "34292": "Who will become the sharer of this dangerous secret?",
  "34293": "What is the gift of conquest but safety?",
  "34294": "French, eh?",
  "34295": "Is he too so very remarkable?",
  "34296": "Who do you think is going to be married tomorrow?",
  "34297": "Both, on the other hand, had joined pretty gaily in the conversation, for why should they interrupt it?",
  "34298": "I regulate my watch?",
  "34299": "Do you hear, sir?",
  "34300": "How can girls like to have lovers and refuse them?",
  "34301": "Have you finished tea?",
  "34302": "How he out fins and flops about, and blows like a porpoise properly frightened, don't he?",
  "34303": "What like was she?",
  "34304": "Has anything extraordinary happened to you?",
  "34305": "Who made this gruel here?",
  "34306": "And where are they?",
  "34307": "If you had been born such, would you have been here now?",
  "34308": "But how do you come here?",
  "34309": "But I wonder is it so very nice?",
  "34310": "Did it hurt you much?",
  "34311": "Well, well, he made a mistake, didn't he?",
  "34312": "On what principle, then, shall we any longer choose justice rather than the worst injustice?",
  "34313": "Do you reckon YOU can learn 'em anything?",
  "34314": "What do I read here?",
  "34315": "What woman can before her husband?",
  "34316": "Who has the right to dictate to my conscience, and where did he get that right?",
  "34317": "Is she coming, and open, free?",
  "34318": "By your orders?",
  "34319": "To dig the foundations out from under that cabin with?",
  "34320": "Why, you wouldn't break both their hearts now?",

  "34324": "You'll make up for it by making another?",
  "34325": "Bubbles?",
  "34326": "Are you willing to endure to the last, and not once attempt a repayment?",
  "34327": "What are they, my dear friend?",
  "34328": "What d' you want o' him again?",
  "34329": "I hope you think so?",

  "34332": "Had I?",
  "34333": "Jack?",
  "34334": "What means can I take to introduce it to the world?",
  "34335": "And so it came about that the young rat did see a good deal of the world, but how?",
  "34336": "But they will contest the will after your death?",
  "34337": "Walks by night, does she?",

  "34340": "Is that enough?",
  "34341": "What about souls?",
  "34342": "But what have you been doing?",
  "34343": "Do we need common sense and fairness in our regulations?",
  "34344": "Have you let your lodgings, ma'am?",
  "34345": "Ought we to rank this one species with bears, and what should we do with the other species?",
  "34346": "Were you not engaged in it then?",
  "34347": "How do you know that, sir?",
  "34348": "Fond mother, whence these fears?",
  "34349": "As 'what has occurred that has never occurred before?",
  "34350": "Is it conscious?",
  "34351": "What do you know on the subject?",
  "34352": "And what, pray, is your idea of the duties of a devoted friend?",
  "34353": "Who can desire it more than I?",
  "34354": "What would you propose doing?",
  "34355": "What chance have I?",
  "34356": "What were his charms?",
  "34357": "Why should they not work for a uniform minimum of labour conditions through all their communities?",
  "34358": "So he has turned you out?",
  "34359": "Come for long?",
  "34360": "By the way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from?",
  "34361": "Why should he be so mean now?",
  "34362": "After all, I don't funk it, do I?",
  "34363": "Hadn't we better stroll into the park?",
  "34364": "Did ye not care for her?",
  "34365": "DO with it?",

  "34367": "Not know the thing which my own eyes beheld?",
  "34368": "Anything else?",
  "34369": "Will you taste for yourself?",
  "34370": "It's not a very nice night to be out, is it?",
  "34371": "You'll come and meet me as usual, girls?",
  "34372": "Now, had I come upon a hopeless incompatibility?",
  "34373": "Do you know what you're doing?",
  "34374": "Quite a vineyard, hey?",
  "34375": "Do I flatter myself if I allow myself to look at it in that way?",
  "34376": "Have I done right?",
  "34377": "He's all right?",
  "34378": "How can I ever thank you for all the deep obligations you impose upon me every day?",
  "34379": "Was there no loophole of escape?",
  "34380": "I suppose we must take the shapes of beasts?",
  "34381": "What are you surprised at?",
  "34382": "What did they matter when he played divinely?",
  "34383": "Tell me the why of this?",
  "34384": "But is it that makes you go?",
  "34385": "On what plausible ground can it be maintained that a physician should be paid two, three, or a hundred times as much as a peasant?",
  "34386": "Will you graciously let me kiss your hand?",
  "34387": "Who are you to ask me my business?",
  "34388": "But does not this question make a disturbance outside of political circles?",
  "34389": "What influence can I possibly have over a bandit?",
  "34390": "Why don't you make him speak?",
  "34391": "Is there a carriage at the door?",
  "34392": "Do you still wish to do so?",
  "34393": "At all events, what use was there in delaying?",
  "34394": "And what right had she to be cross?",
  "34395": "What's the good, if you're sick with love for him?",
  "34396": "How should you?",
  "34397": "Is that fine, keen edge upon your soul that gives such avidity for holy things?",
  "34398": "What of the resemblance?",
  "34399": "Why a locksmiths' association in a village?",
  "34400": "Or must I fly the country altogether?",
  "34401": "You play cards, don't you?",
  "34402": "What would have been the result?",
  "34403": "Back at last?",
  "34404": "What else could this fragment be but the sole surviving remnant of some sumptuous mansion that once had stood on this unrivaled site?",
  "34405": "Isn't it possible to help them?",
  "34406": "Did you notice how he answered to it?",
  "34407": "In relation to what objects?",
  "34408": "Are these powers conferred on you by the state legislature or by some higher authority?",
  "34409": "You WERE afraid?",
  "34410": "Do you think I am deceiving you?",
  "34411": "How can you know what he is?",
  "34412": "What were you eating there all by yourself for your dinner?",
  "34413": "What'll yer give me?",
  "34414": "Are you going to sail in?",
  "34415": "Wonder if you'll ever drag me up there?",
  "34416": "Is there any need to hurry, sir?",
  "34417": "Still I ask you, what is this to me?",
  "34418": "And leave the litter as it is?",
  "34419": "Do you advance with him?",
  "34420": "So perhaps I shall rub on?",
  "34421": "In front or behind?",
  "34422": "And by what authority?",
  "34423": "Yea, what then?",
  "34424": "I really could not say?",
  "34425": "And does he imagine that the coadjutor will put himself out for him?",
  "34426": "Do you think she will ever forget that her son is her safeguard, her shield, the pledge for her dignity, for her fortune and her life?",
  "34427": "You said prince, did you not?",
  "34428": "Are you sure they won't come and search the garret?",
  "34429": "Was it worth it?",
  "34430": "What young ladies?",
  "34431": "Shall we turn back?",
  "34432": "At the end of your name stands for?",
  "34433": "Is it not time to decide finally the meaning of the gift of the great fortune now all in your hand, and growing?",
  "34434": "Well, are we going to stand here all day?",
  "34435": "Have we reached the limits of what reason can supply?",
  "34436": "What should I say?",
  "34437": "What will gladden your heart?",
  "34438": "Are you sure it will be the last time?",
  "34439": "She'll do, won't she?",
  "34440": "What is that for a man to do?",
  "34441": "Since when?",
  "34442": "Why, soldiers, why?",
  "34443": "How came you to read some of those queerer ones?",
  "34444": "Did you not love your husband either?",
  "34445": "Where is true peace or true glory?",
  "34446": "How is it now?",
  "34447": "Durys?",
  "34448": "Don't you want to stop any longer?",
  "34449": "Has the reality of them ever been perceived by you through the bodily organs?",
  "34450": "Which girls should love?",
  "34451": "When was it?",
  "34452": "Does it belong to anybody in the neighbourhood?",
  "34453": "The person to whom I addressed my scruples asked me where your father had acquired his property?",
  "34454": "Has anything happened?",
  "34455": "Did you hit her?",
  "34456": "Is there any signal for the general rally?",
  "34457": "About what age is he?",
  "34458": "And why did I come here?",
  "34459": "What mercy can you expect from the man whom you have wronged?",
  "34460": "Have I taken an oath of some sort, then?",
  "34461": "Shall we say, in such a case, that the will of the majority was for the ultimate end?",
  "34462": "Where what?",
  "34463": "You say?",
  "34464": "Do you no longer like to think of your mother?",
  "34465": "What are you doing?",
  "34466": "May I understand, sir, that you threat is withdrawn, and that my income is secure?",
  "34467": "Are the two so deeply separated in this town, that there is no place whatever for an honest workman between them?",
  "34468": "Why then should a man cling to a longer stay here?",
  "34469": "The symptoms are marked, do you see?",
  "34470": "Who captured you?",
  "34471": "But supposing we had the authority, I would ask what good can result from the examination?",
  "34472": "What am I coming for?",
  "34473": "But settled?",
  "34474": "Did I like his voice?",
  "34475": "How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor?",
  "34476": "Who to?",
  "34477": "And the girl?",
  "34478": "Well, have you had a good hunt, have you botanised successfully?",
  "34479": "And why should you want to spite her?",
  "34480": "What did you pick me up for?",
  "34481": "And what does 'in my name' mean?",
  "34482": "What, are you all got together, like players at the end of the last act?",
  "34483": "Have you ever seen it?",
  "34484": "Isn't it the truth?",
  "34485": "When, then, did father and son exchange shields, and why?",
  "34486": "Would he have been justified in sacrificing his own child, even if he could thereby save another's?",
  "34487": "Why are you only laying one place?",
  "34488": "Loves him?",
  "34489": "Yet who are the folk whom you find HERE?",
  "34490": "Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?",
  "34491": "Who is coming in here?",
  "34492": "What was she going to say, and what reply would she get?",
  "34493": "Can you tell me how to go about getting on the stage?",
  "34494": "What was your idea, then?",
  "34495": "Running from what?",
  "34496": "Valdemar?",
  "34497": "How are you going to manage to get out?",
  "34498": "Have you a portmanteau?",
  "34499": "What does it matter?",
  "34500": "What depth have we now reached?",
  "34501": "For my sake you are prepared to do this terrible thing?",
  "34502": "Wouldn't you have been rude?",
  "34503": "What the deuse do we men go to school for?",
  "34504": "If it be called swamp or sky?",
  "34505": "Defend ourselves against D'Artagnan?",
  "34506": "How the devil is he so like?",
  "34507": "Once more, will you undertake it?",
  "34508": "Are not these functions proper to the soul, and can they rightly be assigned to any other?",
  "34509": "Was it sheer blind force of passion that would satisfy her now?",
  "34510": "How's this, dear niece?",
  "34511": "Do you know who that was?",
  "34512": "Was SHE at the ball too?",
  "34513": "And what made you ask it of me?",
  "34514": "Do you know that if we should ship, it would serve you quite right?",
  "34515": "Where are your wits?",
  "34516": "Is it possible, dear, that what I hear is true?",
  "34517": "No clue?",
  "34518": "Will you give me as far from the river as you can distinguish the belly of a horse?",
  "34519": "So what if he died, how did this concern the boy?",
  "34520": "Build I in the winds my dwelling?",
  "34521": "And what more free than he that desireth nothing upon earth?",
  "34522": "Don't you know he has hit a man, and shot an injured father through the hat only?",
  "34523": "And you have them?",
  "34524": "But don't you love me, my dear wife, because I have been so pulled down by illness?",
  "34525": "I don't know if you notice it?",
  "34526": "Did I indeed, sir?",
  "34527": "And are greater miracles to be performed by those who do not follow his footsteps, who healed the body to reach the mind?",
  "34528": "And did I say there was any difficulty?",
  "34529": "Have I not got a brave determination of all my doubts, and a response in all things agreeable to the oracle that gave it?",
  "34530": "Could I leave the lady alone?",
  "34531": "Is it really?",
  "34532": "Don't you think I've been extraordinarily good?",
  "34533": "Do you think I'm not sufficiently ruining my health living here amid the continual emanations of the pharmacy?",
  "34534": "What be ye looking at?",
  "34535": "How should she be able to compose herself when she should first see him?",
  "34536": "But tell me, what would you have done?",
  "34537": "Confused?",
  "34538": "Wherefrom do they acquire these tendencies, these peculiarities?",
  "34539": "Who first seduced them to that foul revolt?",
  "34540": "If they want to jump down, now, and get into trouble, who objects?",
  "34541": "Do you regard that meaning as offensive?",
  "34542": "And why does the former operation end exactly when the latter commences?",
  "34543": "What is your notion?",
  "34544": "What now was my plain duty?",
  "34545": "But where can one jump to?",
  "34546": "Isn't he idle?",
  "34547": "And how were they?",
  "34548": "Who told you his name?",
  "34549": "Who and where is he?",
  "34550": "Shall we then raise cuckolds?",
  "34551": "Guess I did, didn't I?",
  "34552": "But that I make no admissions?",
  "34553": "Am I deceived?",
  "34554": "What's the good of daylight now?",
  "34555": "What are the facts?",
  "34556": "Have you nothing to say to us?",
  "34557": "Can you tell when there is a good fire?",
  "34558": "What on earth will she say to me, I wonder?",
  "34559": "Where are thy sisters?",
  "34560": "Did you anticipate the accident which has happened to your granddaughter?",
  "34561": "What cause had you to make discoveries of his pretended passion?",
  "34562": "Elopement?",
  "34563": "How shall I be able to endure life for thirteen years?",
  "34564": "How deeply sir, you apprehend it?",
  "34565": "Cake or bread and butter?",
  "34566": "Or might you have only travelled for your amusement?",
  "34567": "Who has not seen poor birds caught by their feet in the lime?",
  "34568": "I have seen you before, I think?",
  "34569": "Does not the practice of despoiling an enemy afford an excuse for not facing the battle?",
  "34570": "The place is then, as you know, determined on rebellion?",
  "34571": "And was that the upshot of my life's hardest battle?",
  "34572": "When did you shed tears over lost souls?",
  "34573": "And the chief officer?",
  "34574": "Is it not horrible?",
  "34575": "On plantation?",
  "34576": "When you say it that way it sounds comical, does it not?",
  "34577": "What did you do with the girl?",
  "34578": "Who would want to injure us, or damage the projectile?",
  "34579": "How do you distinguish them?",
  "34580": "Haidee, would it please you not to leave me?",
  "34581": "But if they don't do for us, if they're stupid?",
  "34582": "In the name of the ninth day, what manner of creature are you?",
  "34583": "It is then a service which you propose to render us, count?",
  "34584": "Whence comes this charm of the mustache, will you tell me?",
  "34585": "Why a blue coat?",
  "34586": "Are you here for good?",
  "34587": "What was I telling you?",
  "34588": "Snakes?",
  "34589": "May I ask you a question?",
  "34590": "And yet does not your honor fear to compromise yourself by allowing such a sum to be carried away for the service of your enemy?",
  "34591": "Then have we got to part?",
  "34592": "But what do you want to do with these chickens?",
  "34593": "Do you suggest that I should do that to a similarly garbed female?",
  "34594": "And if I do not read it, what shall you do, mamma?",
  "34595": "What is going on here?",
  "34596": "Can I see her first?",
  "34597": "And the profits are large?",
  "34598": "You let him go?",
  "34599": "How can he save them?",
  "34600": "Barkis, do you mean?",
  "34601": "Why don't you like her husband?",
  "34602": "All right, is it?",
  "34603": "I can't help it, can I?",
  "34604": "Is that the sort of fellow?",
  "34605": "And that's all you want?",
  "34606": "Number of what, child?",
  "34607": "Fluffed in his lines, did he?",
  "34608": "But was resistance and, in the last place, victory possible?",
  "34609": "Ought not a son to love his father, whatever happens?",
  "34610": "Why, you wished to have a talk with me when the others left?",
  "34611": "Have you ever heard anything particular respecting his birth?",
  "34612": "But how did we become engaged?",
  "34613": "What, with the sacred treasure?",
  "34614": "Did this man belong to the double enigma of order and disorder?",
  "34615": "Then he has travelled?",
  "34616": "Will you not take my word?",
  "34617": "I pray you say, what would you ask?",
  "34618": "What is the name of this obliging youth?",
  "34619": "Don't you see their terrible eyes?",
  "34620": "Have they sentenced you?",
  "34621": "I am the ghost's accomplice?",
  "34622": "You 'eathen, where the mischief 'ave you been?",
  "34623": "And has not this been our own case in the matter of equals and of absolute equality?",
  "34624": "And if I do my duty and do right, you will sustain me, will you not?",
  "34625": "Do not you also?",
  "34626": "His race, his form, his name almost unknown?",
  "34627": "But you will see him yourself?",
  "34628": "'What do you mean?",
  "34629": "How can one talk to the masters like that?",
  "34630": "And yet they say that war is like a game of chess?",
  "34631": "But what does he want of them?",
  "34632": "Is it thy resolve that both shall die?",
  "34633": "But what's your real name?",
  "34634": "Then why did you stay with us, and blast your prospects?",
  "34635": "And the salary?",
  "34636": "Have you heard the news, sir?",
  "34637": "Or to what port are we bound?",
  "34638": "Why, then, is it, when neither law nor justice forbids it, that we are asked to spend our time and money in inquiring into its truth?",
  "34639": "And what will all her learning and her daintiness do for her, now?",
  "34640": "How has this terrible past been recalled?",
  "34641": "Am I to feed upon wisdom like a dog?",
  "34642": "Indeed, why not?",
  "34643": "Could not you, sir, estimate their maximum?",
  "34644": "Is this the fact?",
  "34645": "Barsad?",
  "34646": "I suppose you won't be back before three?",
  "34647": "And our poor cactuses, where are they?",
  "34648": "What muscles he had?",
  "34649": "Why, what do you mean?",
  "34650": "No, but what can I do?",
  "34651": "Have they allowed the headsman to escape?",
  "34652": "Is perseverance a virtue?",
  "34653": "Can you ever forgive me?",
  "34654": "You really think that your solution must be correct?",
  "34655": "Have you considered the terrible chances of this war?",
  "34656": "You have nothing further to say to me?",
  "34657": "Shall I cut away?",
  "34658": "A hundred leagues?",
  "34659": "Has he asked you to be his wife?",
  "34660": "Is thy daughter mine now?",
  "34661": "Now, what's up?",
  "34662": "PISTHETAERUS I?",
  "34663": "Is there anything you dislike in me that you act so contrarily to my wishes?",
  "34664": "Anger?",
  "34665": "Is it not some bad affair?",
  "34666": "Will you do it?",
  "34667": "I wonder how many I shall meet going back?",
  "34668": "Could it be possible that they had escaped?",
  "34669": "Are you SURE you were quite comfortable?",
  "34670": "Had he any weapons?",
  "34671": "Was there no way by which I might have enjoyed in freedom comforts even greater than those which I now earn by servitude?",
  "34672": "What is spirit?",
  "34673": "Ladies, what man's love is there that would stand a year's nursing of the object of his affection?",
  "34674": "How I gwyne to ketch her en I out in de woods?",
  "34675": "Won't you stop all night?",
  "34676": "Then why were you taught to shoot?",
  "34677": "This resolution could have originated only with himself, for who would have dared to suggest it to him?",

  "34704": "Is it not a beautiful language and admirable?",
  "34705": "Sdeath, what's this to me?",
  "34706": "Don't you know of any such place for me, sir?",
  "34707": "Why, what other strangers are coming in?",
  "34708": "Why does the parent turn away from his child, and forbid him his presence for a time?",
  "34709": "What is a shame?",
  "34710": "And you ask me, whether I am an adherent of that church which maligns and damns you?",

  "34713": "Not understand it, sir?",
  "34714": "If they were all bad, who had made them so?",
  "34715": "It's YOUR father's, isn't it?",
  "34716": "Isn't it too soon?",
  "34717": "What encouraged me not to become your surety, but to patronize you?",
  "34718": "Who ever gave again the breath of a life lost?",
  "34719": "Did he say when he would be back?",
  "34720": "Yes or no, is it an honorable indemnity?",
  "34721": "As how?",
  "34722": "Do you imagine that this anaemic youth was capable of so frightful an assault?",
  "34723": "I'd far better help you, hadn't I?",

  "34773": "Do you care for that young fellow?",
  "34774": "Well, old lady?",
  "34775": "But you want to speak to me, I suppose?",
  "34776": "Where have you been?",
  "34777": "To compete with phrasemongers, incapable of thinking consecutively for sixty seconds?",
  "34778": "Have I the time?",
  "34779": "Tea?",
  "34780": "What did you begin to tell me about the prince?",
  "34781": "Did anybody ever ask you?",
  "34782": "Sha'n't we ever go to see him?",
  "34783": "But why didn't you tell me, dearest?",
  "34784": "YOU think so?",
  "34785": "Can you give me no other weapon?",
  "34786": "Is that the moon?",
  "34787": "Nothing but saddles?",
  "34788": "Or would I have all the daughters at once in a perfect nosegay?",
  "34789": "Isn't there a vacant bed upstairs at the store?",
  "34790": "Shall our eyes gaze on and on, and feast themselves on that sight for all eternity?",
  "34791": "What are you making such a noise about over there?",
  "34792": "And your home?",
  "34793": "But perhaps you need not now?",
  "34794": "How is it you didn't go head over heels?",
  "34795": "Of what colour is the tip?",

  "34859": "When will they be here?",
  "34860": "How far is the nearest village from here?",
  "34861": "It is very terrible, is it not, to be like that?",
  "34862": "What's it?",
  "34863": "When two knights have met in an affray of arms and when one has beaten the other, which of the two do you think is the better?",
  "34864": "And where are these four men?",
  "34865": "And what have you gained?",
  "34866": "Was this possible?",
  "34867": "May I look at it?",
  "34868": "Why should it be of any importance to me?",
  "34869": "Did you get shook up much?",
  "34870": "You saw the person?",
  "34871": "And shall I caulk the seams, sir?",
  "34872": "Isn't somebody coming?",

  "34879": "Who has been tormenting the child?",
  "34880": "Is there nobody in the house to cheer or help him?",
  "34881": "And the cardinal?",
  "34882": "Why should he not throw over his own people altogether, money, position, society, and all, and give himself up to love?",
  "34883": "Are you at all superstitious?",
  "34884": "But if they die?",
  "34885": "Rascal, eh?",
  "34886": "You approve of him?",
  "34887": "And who is thy father?",
  "34888": "And what was it that had suggested the tremendous tumult?",
  "34889": "Who subscribes?",
  "34890": "There is a room for me?",
  "34891": "Tom, you naughty boy, where's your sister?",

  "34893": "And you are to go down at twelve?",
  "34894": "When again shall such infantile transparency be mine?",
  "34895": "But, first, how would you have 'em served here?",
  "34896": "I suppose then, that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set in a foggy squall is the height of a whaleman's discretion?",
  "34897": "But what was the matter with the old lumber nag?",
  "34898": "Or why is it suggested that three or four confederacies would be better than one?",
  "34899": "Did my people not find you, my dear D'Artagnan?",
  "34900": "And you climb up?",
  "34901": "Who else could compare my brother's baby with your boy?",
  "34902": "Then why didn't you get her off before?",

  "34922": "What's the matter, my boy?",
  "34923": "What if you never meet him?",
  "34924": "Do you mean to ridicule me, monsieur?",
  "34925": "What country does he come from?",
  "34926": "What time did you dine?",
  "34927": "Would you tell him?",
  "34928": "Have you really burned it?",
  "34929": "Do you still remember your childhood?",
  "34930": "Well, what is it now?",
  "34931": "Did the old guy say anything more?",
  "34932": "As long as you know that it is not he, why do you say such foolish things?",
  "34933": "And I shall find your eminence ready?",
  "34934": "Why was his hair tinted with gold?",
  "34935": "You desire to fathom this horrible secret?",
  "34936": "Why, what DO they do to her, my lad?",
  "34937": "What are our ediles about?",
  "34938": "Nemo?",
  "34939": "But how can we be sure that there is no trap laid for us?",

  "34946": "You are the nineteenth century?",
  "34947": "And what was that?",
  "34948": "What is the self?",
  "34949": "And what is it?",
  "34950": "But what has this to do with you being alive?",
  "34951": "How do you need money?",
  "34952": "And you are not a pining outcast amongst strangers?",
  "34953": "And why should you not do it?",
  "34954": "May we wait again to talk of it till she has done so?",
  "34955": "And what position will you adopt toward the government?",
  "34956": "Conscientiously?",
  "34957": "At what place?",
  "34958": "Or take revenge?",
  "34959": "So you intend to hinder us in our work, my daughter?",
  "34960": "And you know that, do you?",
  "34961": "Must I perish under the hands of savages?",
  "34962": "Do you dance, count?",

  "35001": "But why?",
  "35002": "Now when a projectile is launched into space, what happens to it?",
  "35003": "What did it ask you?",
  "35004": "What is this way?",
  "35005": "And what did the count do?",
  "35006": "Have we found our happy valley?",
  "35007": "What does all this mean?",
  "35008": "And now you will do me a favor, will you not?",
  "35009": "No, really, have you anything against me?",
  "35010": "What are you then?",
  "35011": "To whom are YOU of use?",
  "35012": "What mother, said the mayor, does the man mean?",
  "35013": "Does it matter so very much?",
  "35014": "If your comrades see him, what would they do?",
  "35015": "What will become of her, if you cast her off?",
  "35016": "If that is the case, why did you begin by making such a fuss about it?",
  "35017": "To engage in a contest with you?",
  "35018": "Who is that officer who appears in command?",
  "35019": "Do you think it will be a wet afternoon?",
  "35020": "Can you do nothing?",
  "35021": "Yet what is expectation but a kind of folly, and what is that folly but an excess of hope?",
  "35022": "But how do you, how can you, account for it not being there?",
  "35023": "And why by no other line?",
  "35024": "Counted every tree?",
  "35025": "What, then, of the future?",
  "35026": "Or did she wish by a sort of voluptuous stoicism to feel the more profoundly the bitterness of the things she was about to leave?",
  "35027": "They'll be here to dinner, then?",
  "35028": "And who can that person be who has taken it into his head to wrap himself up in a blue coat embroidered with green?",
  "35029": "He is peculiar, is he not?",
  "35030": "Whose image sanctifies the game?",
  "35031": "Don't you see how I'm pining away?",
  "35032": "Who would you suggest?",
  "35033": "Then how did you manage to find me?",
  "35034": "And it will be argued, that a man need be less thankful because, at the moment of receiving, he utters not thanksgiving?",
  "35035": "But what would you do?",
  "35036": "What is it then we can here dispute about?",
  "35037": "They must keep them there for that, don't they?",
  "35038": "Indeed, what living man could, by a mere morning visit, have surprised them more?",
  "35039": "That's your sort, is it?",
  "35040": "But what awaits us tomorrow?",
  "35041": "Any reward this time?",
  "35042": "You have found it out at last, have you?",
  "35043": "Is there a fire in the library?",
  "35044": "Contented?",
  "35045": "Why didn't she answer my avowal?",
  "35046": "How could I?",
  "35047": "And how far is it?",
  "35048": "And what do you think of a second principle?",
  "35049": "Can I help you?",
  "35050": "Is that at us?",
  "35051": "Is there any one in this village who lets out teams?",
  "35052": "Is that a threat, citoyen?",
  "35053": "And if the patricians were really innocent, why did they not urge the examination?",
  "35054": "A real breakfast, on a real table, with a cloth and napkins?",
  "35055": "What could he mean?",
  "35056": "Where have you been?",
  "35057": "Granted, quoth you?",
  "35058": "What drunken brawl keeps him away?",
  "35059": "Unhurt?",
  "35060": "Where is he now?",
  "35061": "And the rebels?",
  "35062": "Ay, and our ignorance maintain'd it as well, did it not?",
  "35063": "You wished to say a few more words?",
  "35064": "And the sister at the post?",
  "35065": "You do want to come, don't you?",
  "35066": "And when does the next train pass here?",
  "35067": "And what is there that we lay to the charge of the father?",
  "35068": "But when a girl can work out trigonometry at sight, what use can she possibly have for marriage?",
  "35069": "Did you really say it?",
  "35070": "Once we hight warriors, and shall we perish in this country by the hand of a woman?",
  "35071": "I wonder whether you hate me?",
  "35072": "Art come to arrest us?",
  "35073": "Did he remain bowed?",
  "35074": "Whom have you lived with?",
  "35075": "How does this come about?",
  "35076": "Was it of a higher order?",
  "35077": "Word of honour?",
  "35078": "Which way shall I use it?",
  "35079": "Wonder if he O's as much there as he does here?",
  "35080": "Nor can the good harm any one?",
  "35081": "Who's the man?",
  "35082": "Where is the key of the green box?",
  "35083": "What, after yesterday?",
  "35084": "Tell me, are you a very learned man?",

  "35875": "For such matters?",
  "35876": "And do you object to going through the village?",
  "35877": "What do you think of that figure there?",
  "35878": "To how many people can any one tell all?",
  "35879": "Could a body hypocritically take there a small hypocritical touch?",
  "35880": "How have they made me a victim?",
  "35881": "But where can he be?",
  "35882": "How am I?",
  "35883": "And what did she say?",
  "35884": "What could he have done to me?",
  "35885": "Do you take us for thieves?",
  "35886": "For a young cobra?",
  "35887": "And how did you like the master?",
  "35888": "He won't have it?",

  "35890": "France?",
  "35891": "Tell me, my dear sir, do you admit the existence of volcanoes on the moon's surface?",
  "35892": "What could be the meaning of his sudden change toward me?",
  "35893": "He warned you to abandon your visit?",
  "35894": "Did you really come to propose to me?",
  "35895": "And then, you ungrateful being, you are not pleased to see an old friend?",
  "35896": "Will you return to this gang of robbers, and to this man, when a word can save you?",
  "35897": "Because of the money?",
  "35898": "Who could place my feet on the right path, and bring me back to my company?",
  "35899": "Why did you pull the curtain over the place to make me think you were still there?",
  "35900": "And are the hours the same?",
  "35901": "What is the reason?",
  "35902": "Money is no object?",
  "35903": "Where, then, could the driver be, unless he were inside the house?",
  "35904": "Nay, has not a little rationality exposed many women to the severest censure?",
  "35905": "Was that all right?",
  "35906": "What is it?",
  "35907": "Why is the ardour of youth thus to be damped, and the luxuriancy of fancy cut to the quick?",
  "35908": "If there be no distinction between the pleasing and the disgusting, why does it accept the one or reject the other?",
  "35909": "How is that?",
  "35910": "What consolation does the poor suffering soul find in the superb coffin, in the splendid funeral?",
  "35911": "And what am I myself?",
  "35912": "Egeria?",
  "35913": "Have you dined?",
  "35914": "You are very lonely, are you not?",
  "35915": "Do you try to force them?",
  "35916": "What do you all say to a wrestling match?",
  "35917": "It was very game of her, wasn't it?",
  "35918": "What will the servants think?",

  "35921": "Now, what is the harvest fortnight to be?",
  "35922": "Notwithstanding your father's wishes to the contrary?",
  "35923": "How many other families have never had that same opportunity?",
  "35924": "Ye higher men, what think ye?",
  "35925": "Are there many of them?",
  "35926": "I am now among princes like myself, am I not?",
  "35927": "What do you mean by tetragones?",
  "35928": "And you have been in the choir in pursuance of your duties?",
  "35929": "If all is well, why go to the lodge?",
  "35930": "None?",
  "35931": "By what path did you get thither?",
  "35932": "Can we get behind his track so that they may smell it?",
  "35933": "You have how many new suits?",
  "35934": "How far mus go up, massa?",
  "35935": "Where's that?",
  "35936": "Is she discouraged, does she drag herself about the house and find fault with everything?",
  "35937": "What whole thing?",
  "35938": "Since it was your intention to live alone, why did you throw into the sea the document which put us on your track?",
  "35939": "If this were human life, if these were human beings, living in a complete world, then what was her own world, outside?",
  "35940": "We are at peace and, why then, should they harm us?",
  "35941": "Then you believe the papers?",
  "35942": "What must I do, officer?",
  "35943": "What do you like to talk about?",
  "35944": "Getting a bit hot, eh?",
  "35945": "If she had wished it, would she not have sent to me by this time?",
  "35946": "Or whom oppose?",
  "35947": "Was it, when he set his heart upon it?",
  "35948": "You, who refuse to tell me the slightest thing?",
  "35949": "Where's mama?",
  "35950": "Are we in any great danger?",
  "35951": "Or will a reaction set in which may arrest progress and even undo much that has been done?",
  "35952": "You are only responsible for my body, is it not so?",
  "35953": "How can you deliberately get up such paltry falsehoods?",
  "35954": "Afterwards to me?",
  "35955": "Carries a bag?",
  "35956": "Shall you not all help me?",
  "35957": "Shall I cut it out?",
  "35958": "Is it possible you don't understand that yet?",
  "35959": "Would not the doing of this be your best mode of counteracting his raid on your communications?",
  "35960": "After dinner, eh?",
  "35961": "Well, what, my dear girl?",
  "35962": "What would they say if I did not go?",
  "35963": "But to what in the world?",
  "35964": "By your leave, do you know me, sir?",
  "35965": "He will be ruined, you mean?",
  "35966": "What of the prisoner?",
  "35967": "Then it appears there will be an opposition, and the enterprise will be disputed?",
  "35968": "Have you heard?",
  "35969": "Will you dine with me?",
  "35970": "Does he ever come back to this neighborhood?",
  "35971": "Is true, as they tell me, that I can't even go away?",
  "35972": "And now, tell me your name?",
  "35973": "Do you fear their finding it here, should they come to search?",
  "35974": "If they don't look foolish its a pity?",
  "35975": "Will they be injured in any way?",
  "35976": "Whither are they going?",
  "35977": "Is this the gentleman's little purse?",
  "35978": "What is it, now?",
  "35979": "Was it a thicket?",
  "35980": "Was this the beginning of a happy change?",
  "35981": "Sir, may I have a few words with you concerning some business I have just decided upon?",
  "35982": "But where are you really going?",
  "35983": "What am dat?",
  "35984": "I hope there is no reason to distrust his fidelity?",
  "35985": "I like it very much, and he doesn't seem tired of it yet, which is very good of him, isn't it?",
  "35986": "Of twelve rowers?",
  "35987": "How can one talk or think of such trifles?",
  "35988": "But what are we to do now?",
  "35989": "How does it happen that the presence of a woman overwhelms us so?",
  "35990": "Which do you know?",
  "35991": "You ask me what I will do?",
  "35992": "Then, surely, you will not object to lend it to us?",
  "35993": "What of him?",
  "35994": "Wot is this here business?",
  "35995": "And do you know what has become of him?",
  "35996": "But that you have gathered already?",
  "35997": "Can you tell me, please, who is his favourite actor?",
  "35998": "What more could I hope to do by prolonging the interview?",
  "35999": "Pierced?",
  "36000": "What do you expect to get?",
  "36001": "Besides, was he not in the secret?",
  "36002": "Was it of any use to explain?",
  "36003": "How's the rheumatics?",
  "36004": "But where can one go?",
  "36005": "Where am I?",
  "36006": "Was it after all true that she had been conducting herself in a way that justified the world in thinking that she liked the man?",
  "36007": "Gold, ain't it?",
  "36008": "And, pray, who are you yourself?",
  "36009": "Is it possible for such a reason?",
  "36010": "Oh, how could we, on your money?",
  "36011": "Why should I give you courage?",
  "36012": "And how much have you got?",
  "36013": "How are you, young man?",
  "36014": "Chillip?",
  "36015": "I say, why are you so late?",
  "36016": "Will the job suit you?",
  "36017": "And who charges me with this, monseigneur?",
  "36018": "Shall I go on?",
  "36019": "Whence, now, bear ye burnished shields, harness gray and helmets grim, spears in multitude?",
  "36020": "To what do they seem to you to be like?",
  "36021": "And how stands the total?",
  "36022": "And did they not leave him on the south side of the river, with their prisoners, while they have gone foolishly on the north?",
  "36023": "Or spiders?",
  "36024": "But you receive him at your house?",
  "36025": "Was there a human agency in the matter?",
  "36026": "And what is the coachman like?",
  "36027": "Have we beheld demons?",
  "36028": "What is his religious doctrine to me, if he carries some good notions along with it?",
  "36029": "And when will that be, father?",
  "36030": "Who could have told her?",
  "36031": "That's it?",
  "36032": "She must have suffered terribly, hasn't she?",
  "36033": "How can I describe my sensations on beholding it?",
  "36034": "What can it be that has this double power?",
  "36035": "And yet you have sent for me?",
  "36036": "Why does a chicken cross the road?",
  "36037": "Who's got the job?",
  "36038": "Is she pretty?",
  "36039": "If ever you can get aboard again, says you?",
  "36040": "I don't know how I can ever make it up to you?",
  "36041": "Shall I fire my rifle off and scare him?",
  "36042": "Have you ever told a lie?",
  "36043": "If he forces us to it, they'll be producible, won't they?",
  "36044": "You have seen it on dozens of girls, and you never found out that it was pretty till now?",
  "36045": "What, the whole property there?",
  "36046": "But don't you know it is extremely wicked to do such things?",
  "36047": "Is it so important to you?",
  "36048": "What fiend possesses you to stare back at me, continually, with those infernal eyes?",
  "36049": "But why had they not treasured up the water after it was used?",
  "36050": "Even in the country do we get any rest?",
  "36051": "What is it, my friend?",
  "36052": "Why calls my friend?",
  "36053": "Were you examined at an inquest?",
  "36054": "How do they love it dressed?",
  "36055": "How can they get loose when there's a guard over them, ready to shoot them down if they move a peg?",
  "36056": "When were thy frequent pledges and still more frequent gifts believed or accepted?",
  "36057": "Your husband, then, is at last dead?",
  "36058": "Pillage?",
  "36059": "Is everyone all right?",
  "36060": "Do you know, sir, these gentlemen are each of them worth fifteen hundred pounds?",
  "36061": "What do you say of this?",
  "36062": "And you don't know when he'll go away?",
  "36063": "Which do YOU think it was?",
  "36064": "Why is that gendarme there?",
  "36065": "Wouldn't that console you?",
  "36066": "But what are these beasts?",
  "36067": "You think your sister will come?",
  "36068": "You see him?",
  "36069": "Against the westland clans?",
  "36070": "But you won't tell him?",
  "36071": "And when will you come to see mamma?",
  "36072": "He did not happen to see our plan of fortifications, did he?",
  "36073": "You are not going out, I hope?",
  "36074": "Was he blind?",
  "36075": "Does your majesty grant me this?",
  "36076": "Where was the horse?",
  "36077": "You won't stop for dinner?",
  "36078": "Well, you'll want to make up your mind pretty soon, won't you, if we're going?",
  "36079": "When is it going to be?",
  "36080": "Do you still feel any desire to stand up in his defence?",
  "36081": "Was it prepared?",
  "36082": "Do you know who made you?",
  "36083": "What sort of a watchman, of a checker, are you?",
  "36084": "I hoped it was true?",
  "36085": "After?",
  "36086": "Why will you not grant my last wish?",
  "36087": "Do you pay taxes to an agent that he may destroy your property?",
  "36088": "He would have to fly, and where?",
  "36089": "In a figurative sense, how far, and to what offences, may it be extended?",
  "36090": "And what do you think of him?",
  "36091": "The register of my child's birth?",
  "36092": "Was there one exception, and that one he who needed to have been most happy?",
  "36093": "Have you thrown up redoubts?",
  "36094": "Who is this maid?",
  "36095": "But what was she to do?",
  "36096": "The peasants are ruined?",
  "36097": "Who but a billionaire could say what was fair exchange for a billion?",
  "36098": "Two pounds, and you bring it back?",
  "36099": "Don't he?",
  "36100": "You love me just a little, then, marquise?",
  "36101": "Why are you virtuous?",
  "36102": "Are you far gone with a fool?",
  "36103": "Don't you remember how you used to say that we must always tell the truth?",
  "36104": "Us, won't they?",
  "36105": "How can a man conceal his character?",
  "36106": "What should I do?",
  "36107": "Is that all?",
  "36108": "Who, sire?",
  "36109": "I think I am a philosopher, perhaps, and who knows, perhaps I do wish to teach my views of things to those I meet with?",
  "36110": "Do I seem one to fear for myself?",
  "36111": "But suppose you've bitten a specky bit by accident?",
  "36112": "But where do they sleep?",
  "36113": "You have seen him, then?",
  "36114": "But, just what did the genewal tell you?",
  "36115": "There's nothing to keep you, is there?",
  "36116": "Nicholas, when when did you break your cameo?",
  "36117": "D'you remember the last time we met?",
  "36118": "What hope could there have been for him then?",
  "36119": "You have no mother?",
  "36120": "Outside of a private car?",
  "36121": "How is she ever to do better?",
  "36122": "You had heard that there was an execution in the house?",
  "36123": "Can you see where he has put his rifle or his bow?",
  "36124": "But who the deuce is he following?",
  "36125": "Are not necessary pleasures those of which we cannot get rid, and of which the satisfaction is a benefit to us?",
  "36126": "Can they understand or explain even their own characters?",
  "36127": "And why so?",
  "36128": "Is he a good doctor, my love?",
  "36129": "And where is your lodging?",
  "36130": "You won't be quite at the other end of the world, will you?",
  "36131": "I hope, my dear friend, you will carry out your father's wish?",
  "36132": "You have knocked at all doors?",
  "36133": "Wouldn't it give a mighty big bump to her subconscious self, or whatever the jargon is, and start it functioning again right away?",
  "36134": "Old man, how goes?",
  "36135": "But what could he have to do with this old family custom of ours, and what does this rigmarole mean?",
  "36136": "Had his hurt declared itself to be a mortal one?",
  "36137": "Will you take my arm, sir?",
  "36138": "Is it in my character?",
  "36139": "Uncle, what wood is this?",
  "36140": "Well, what did he say then?",
  "36141": "There they were, the words, and what did she want more?",
  "36142": "What does he desire of me?",
  "36143": "Are you like all the rest?",
  "36144": "How dare you grin at me like that?",
  "36145": "Who will make me that summons?",
  "36146": "Especially with copper toes?",
  "36147": "Was it the effect of the lunar rays?",
  "36148": "What have you said?",
  "36149": "You never find he slights his work when your back is turned?",
  "36150": "Perhaps you would like to pay interest?",
  "36151": "Which is she?",
  "36152": "Is that any reason why we should propose to preserve it for ever in a condition of tutelage?",
  "36153": "And my walking up and down for three hours from the table to the stove?",
  "36154": "Not chops?",
  "36155": "Isn't she a clever thing?",
  "36156": "Would he choose the peers, for example?",
  "36157": "Why, how are you?",
  "36158": "Who persuaded them into letting him see if he could drive?",
  "36159": "Do you think you can behead me with a single blow?",
  "36160": "For whence does everything come?",
  "36161": "Where is the letter?",
  "36162": "Poor old who?",
  "36163": "And this stutterer, won't he turn out a murderer?",
  "36164": "Me?",
  "36165": "Do you know this person?",
  "36166": "But you didn't have much to do with him, did you?",
  "36167": "What WILL he do, then?",
  "36168": "Where do you expect to get to?",
  "36169": "Your birthday?",
  "36170": "What have your family got to do with it?",
  "36171": "How much do I get?",
  "36172": "But may he not change and transform himself?",
  "36173": "It is not so?",
  "36174": "Then I shall really have them?",
  "36175": "So you go back from your promise?",
  "36176": "May she?",
  "36177": "Do you remember what I said when you asked me what I should do if I won all the pots I set my heart on and came through alive?",
  "36178": "Is it too great?",
  "36179": "At it again, hey?",
  "36180": "Which was it?",
  "36181": "Then why don't you send this new cove?",
  "36182": "Do you believe in presentiments and superstitions?",
  "36183": "Are you now satisfied?",
  "36184": "Your success too?",
  "36185": "What, then, are we to conclude in regard to the many fishes, both sexes of which are splendidly coloured?",
  "36186": "The bandits whom the abbe keeps in pay and drink have their useful side, have they?",
  "36187": "Can a man who listens to these three counsellors be sure that he is right in a given decision?",
  "36188": "Have we not perfectly understood each other?",
  "36189": "There is a good postal service, I suppose?",
  "36190": "Comes it in there?",
  "36191": "Tell us now, at once, what you made of the present?",
  "36192": "Do you want to be killed?",
  "36193": "What is popular sovereignty?",
  "36194": "Do you think we are sure to come out of the wilderness?",
  "36195": "How hang your pouches?",
  "36196": "Should you like to be her boatman?",
  "36197": "How did I survive and surmount such wounds?",
  "36198": "How often we sin, how much we deceive, and all for what?",
  "36199": "Will soon what?",
  "36200": "Know you anything of your own family at that time?",
  "36201": "And from a noble client?",
  "36202": "So that, in fact, you have never learned or heard anything in particular?",
  "36203": "Marquise, whence do you come?",
  "36204": "What was said or done?",
  "36205": "And where will your worship drink?",
  "36206": "How is it that you have no friends in your prosperity when you had many in adversity?",
  "36207": "King's attorney?",
  "36208": "What could they think indeed?",
  "36209": "HERE?",
  "36210": "If he were in love with the lady?",
  "36211": "Why does she come so close?",
  "36212": "And will he be the better for that?",
  "36213": "What's the matter with your nose, there?",
  "36214": "Now I ax what have they to show for their three months' setting?",
  "36215": "Cherries?",
  "36216": "How are we to know them if we do find them?",
  "36217": "What about the other girl, the one you decoyed away over a week ago?",
  "36218": "How could she not be happy?",
  "36219": "It has been a delightful evening, has it not?",
  "36220": "And now, doctor, what are we to do about money?",
  "36221": "Had they not searched exactly where the document stated?",
  "36222": "How you like it, hey, ole sport?",
  "36223": "But what human language can adequately portray that astonishment, that horror which possessed me at the spectacle then presented to view?",
  "36224": "How came the woman's ring there?",
  "36225": "At best, might not a man in the water lose all his power of direction, and so move in an endless circle until he sank exhausted?",
  "36226": "Does his wife know of it?",
  "36227": "And what is the solar heat?",
  "36228": "If any one were to come in, my dear boy?",
  "36229": "Has your grace taken the precaution to come out in a good stout pair of boots?",

  "36231": "Where would you wish to go?",
  "36232": "What tidings of the foe?",
  "36233": "Why do I think of her as dressed in green?",
  "36234": "Was that all a human being amounted to?",
  "36235": "But you would not advise me to refuse?",
  "36236": "And so much to my honour too?",
  "36237": "And why look there?",
  "36238": "And have you no mind of my weight of passion, and the holy dispensation, and the drift of heifers I am giving, and the golden ring?",
  "36239": "Did you know her?",
  "36240": "And do you not know, I said, that all mere opinions are bad, and the best of them blind?",
  "36241": "But you're not going away?",
  "36242": "I forgive you?",
  "36243": "What do I care?",
  "36244": "I say, you are not jealous, are you?",
  "36245": "How long will a few hundred pounds last such a chap as that?",
  "36246": "Where is he wounded?",

  "36249": "Want any?",
  "36250": "But why?",
  "36251": "If you come to that, it's hardly my place to be flung out of the flat like this and have to go to an hotel, what?",
  "36252": "Will you open, yes or no?",
  "36253": "Isn't that it?",
  "36254": "If so, on what does your constitution rest?",
  "36255": "With whom?",
  "36256": "What were you doing up there?",
  "36257": "Can you have forgotten your oath?",

  "36263": "Do you want to know if I am telling the truth?",
  "36264": "What a state of society is this for a free country?",
  "36265": "But won't this density augment?",
  "36266": "Was it in the afternoon?",
  "36267": "Do you want me to explain what that is?",

  "36380": "Where is he now?",
  "36381": "What are you bothering for?",
  "36382": "Do you seek any guidance from me?",
  "36383": "How on earth should she talk of any one else as long as you are here?",
  "36384": "And a narrative it remains both in the speeches which the poet recites from time to time and in the intermediate passages?",
  "36385": "And others say even that the external world is the work of our organs?",
  "36386": "Am I sorry?",
  "36387": "And, indeed, unless this shoal had a machine in its stomach, how could it change its position with such astonishing rapidity?",
  "36388": "Could the prisoners see each other?",
  "36389": "But why do you ask?",

  "36423": "Well what is WHOM?",
  "36424": "No bad?",
  "36425": "How can they be helped, mama?",
  "36426": "And is not their humanity to the condemned in some cases quite charming?",
  "36427": "Is it not because they have not enough at home wherewith to fill their bellies and their pokes?",
  "36428": "You suppose they really TALK of them?",
  "36429": "Don't you see anything?",
  "36430": "Do you know, my husband, why I came here?",
  "36431": "What, was it conscience then?",

  "36441": "Why had he come to this house?",
  "36442": "What are you going on in this way at me for?",
  "36443": "And if that is true, what sort of general must he have been?",
  "36444": "What's the case now?",
  "36445": "Why may I not rest me from this restlessness and sleep from this wide waking?",
  "36446": "And do you know this gentleman, monsieur?",
  "36447": "Presently?",
  "36448": "Then I have been your property, have I?",
  "36449": "Is that really the case?",
  "36450": "Are the passes open?",

  "37457": "Do you mean to say that this slip of paper will help us?",
  "37458": "What identity?",
  "37459": "Did you bring the things I mentioned?",
  "37460": "But, my lord, if there be no secret of penitence, will the director consent to my being here?",
  "37461": "Do you have a faith, or a knowledge, you follow, which helps you to live and to do right?",
  "37462": "Is not this what we would have all men do to us?",
  "37463": "Well, there wasn't anything else for her to do, was there?",
  "37464": "You hussy, how dare you talk in that way?",
  "37465": "Now, what shall we do?",
  "37466": "Which should it be?",
  "37467": "Would not I have wished, do you think, to have learned all the truth about the matter before I answered him?",
  "37468": "Will you follow me?",
  "37469": "What else can I do?",
  "37470": "How would you like to come into a house and find everyone muttering to themselves?",
  "37471": "And can the just by justice make men unjust, or speaking general can the good by virtue make them bad?",
  "37472": "You're sure?",
  "37473": "Prime, isn't it?",
  "37474": "Are we to see profound wisdom in this?",
  "37475": "Is it not, said she, whispering her husband in his ear, is it not a noble nose?",
  "37476": "Who'll keep THEM quiet?",
  "37477": "Had any difference arisen between him and her papa?",
  "37478": "And what shall I?",
  "37479": "Not so much so?",
  "37480": "You are fond of it?",
  "37481": "May I see it?",
  "37482": "Tell me, do you know what the countess, for whose pardon you are beseeching me, has done?",
  "37483": "Had she not openly avowed her intention of marrying for money if she ever had the chance?",
  "37484": "That the boy may sink and perish?",
  "37485": "Whose there?",
  "37486": "Been there long?",
  "37487": "Which is the way?",
  "37488": "Or his starch'd beard?",
  "37489": "Who knows what may be in store for you yet?",
  "37490": "By this?",
  "37491": "And not long?",
  "37492": "Is that certain?",
  "37493": "Isn't it well drawn?",
  "37494": "Are you asleep?",
  "37495": "Any ideas?",
  "37496": "Have we been deceived by an illusion?",
  "37497": "Was it physical?",
  "37498": "Caution?",
  "37499": "Did not you know that, my dear lord?",
  "37500": "Did not your friend here look like me?",
  "37501": "What are you rattling in there?",
  "37502": "But again, will they tell us that such a nature, placed under favourable circumstances, will not be perfectly good and wise if any ever was?",
  "37503": "Has not one of you a cross?",
  "37504": "What happened to the worthy captain?",
  "37505": "And what does the judge affirm to be the life which is next, and the pleasure which is next?",
  "37506": "Was my uncle stark mad?",
  "37507": "You didn't think it could be so bad?",
  "37508": "You mean she won't mind?",
  "37509": "Or have we found angels in the forms of kings to govern him?",
  "37510": "More in your brains than in your pocket, eh?",
  "37511": "He has come, then, as they told me?",
  "37512": "The only unofficial detective?",
  "37513": "Have you had lunch yet?",
  "37514": "Far from here?",
  "37515": "And what credit can the poor clerk of a procurer have, pray?",
  "37516": "Whither is it carrying me?",
  "37517": "And where are they looking for her?",
  "37518": "Can't you see that I'm as hoarse as a crow?",
  "37519": "But where is your master?",
  "37520": "Who told you this?",
  "37521": "Of what was he thinking?",
  "37522": "Do you think it is too much?",
  "37523": "D'you remember you were rather sniffy about meeting him?",
  "37524": "Is that what you wished to say?",
  "37525": "How much of the ballast of conservatism and of loyalty to tradition is it well to throw overboard in the interest of accelerated motion?",
  "37526": "Shall a similar end be pursued for the ethical purpose of widening the circle of those who shall live and be happy?",
  "37527": "Why have they not seized me?",
  "37528": "When did it happen and what has happened?",
  "37529": "You see?",
  "37530": "How could we like a people who treated us so unjustly?",
  "37531": "When shall the day come when we shall lift our hands?",
  "37532": "Are you then making a thesis?",
  "37533": "Would you like me to bring some rice?",
  "37534": "Who do you want?",
  "37535": "How did he get 'em?",
  "37536": "You wouldn't leave him lying maimed at the bottom of this dreadful place, a moment, if you could bring help to him?",
  "37537": "And is my life to be forfeit, is some terrible punishment to come on my poor old head for that which I cannot help?",
  "37538": "You will be frank with me?",
  "37539": "And was that the head and front of his offending?",
  "37540": "And must he not be represented as such?",
  "37541": "Yes, don't you wish you knew what that card was?",
  "37542": "But what's he doing here?",
  "37543": "He said nothing more?",
  "37544": "And even if he has done wrong, how do I know that he has not condemned himself?",
  "37545": "And do they give you frogs to eat, so's to make you limber?",
  "37546": "A doctor?",
  "37547": "What did you do?",
  "37548": "Would he allow imitation to be the ruling principle of his life, as if he had nothing higher in him?",
  "37549": "Wasn't it rather sudden?",
  "37550": "That's what you tell this gentleman too, is it?",
  "37551": "He's your husband, eh?",
  "37552": "Can I spare him?",
  "37553": "What now?",
  "37554": "Armed?",
  "37555": "Or may not all three be properly allotted to it?",
  "37556": "Anything up?",
  "37557": "Is that so?",
  "37558": "You do not wish to hear it, perhaps?",
  "37559": "What does it matter to me?",
  "37560": "And will not a true astronomer have the same feeling when he looks at the movements of the stars?",
  "37561": "Why, what else are they?",
  "37562": "And s'pose he steps in here any minute, and sings out my name before I can throw him a wink to keep quiet?",
  "37563": "And the just is the good?",
  "37564": "How have I deviated from those principles, monsieur?",
  "37565": "But why FOUR pounds?",
  "37566": "And what did you find?",
  "37567": "What has he come here for?",
  "37568": "Are you inside?",
  "37569": "Downright?",
  "37570": "Do you think she'll miss you?",
  "37571": "Speak I sooth, my masters?",
  "37572": "Why was it necessary to weave the queen into this gloomy web of guilt and crime?",
  "37573": "I suppose that is why you live in town?",
  "37574": "What was the result of that memorable expedition?",
  "37575": "What, then, is the defence?",
  "37576": "What do you mean by risk?",
  "37577": "What would be the use?",
  "37578": "How could she make such nails work?",
  "37579": "Am I not the wife of my husband?",
  "37580": "What came after?",
  "37581": "What is the proposition?",
  "37582": "So?",
  "37583": "How is the snatchblatch?",
  "37584": "Just?",
  "37585": "Did you hear anything of it when you were in those parts?",
  "37586": "What is in this?",
  "37587": "And through what deplorable madness had she thus ruined her life by continual sacrifices?",
  "37588": "Where are the marks of its fangs?",
  "37589": "What d'you say to having something to eat?",
  "37590": "Who was this novice in war with the effrontery of a luminary?",
  "37591": "In my precinct?",
  "37592": "Is she, my lord?",
  "37593": "May this young lady go with us?",
  "37594": "Has no one come to seek her in this land?",
  "37595": "Hadn't we better hear it tomorrow?",
  "37596": "Then you'll be free?",
  "37597": "Monseigneur?",
  "37598": "Is it not sad?",
  "37599": "Can people enchant each other too much, cajole each other too much, charm each other too much?",
  "37600": "Why do they grease the axles of the wheels?",
  "37601": "If there be doubt as to which of our divisions will get our candidate, is there no doubt as to which of your candidates will get your party?",
  "37602": "What did you take me to your mother for?",
  "37603": "And did they ask you to make a speech?",
  "37604": "Don't you see it is hard enough for her already?",
  "37605": "Some such object it was, that induced you to call on me?",
  "37606": "But how about money?",
  "37607": "You here at this hour?",
  "37608": "Well, then, was it this eye or that through which you dropped the beetle?",
  "37609": "What did your excellency say?",
  "37610": "Where are you going, you rascal?",
  "37611": "Do you know, my friends, what that plain, seen from the height we are at, resembles?",
  "37612": "What was the good of bringing him?",
  "37613": "Where was it?",
  "37614": "Would she be decent to him, or would she scold him?",
  "37615": "Which is the best wish to wish him?",
  "37616": "How CAN you say 'I am happier,' and nothing changed?",
  "37617": "Why sadden the poor children, and damp their newly cherished hopes?",
  "37618": "And you feel convinced that you must break with him?",
  "37619": "Alone, where?",
  "37620": "And you saw him frequently?",
  "37621": "Why is she so glad?",
  "37622": "But why do you ask?",
  "37623": "What new treasures lay here for science to unfold?",
  "37624": "What do ye want?",
  "37625": "Rochester?",
  "37626": "What's coming on?",
  "37627": "Are we to wonder, then, if here and there we find in his works an offensive expression?",
  "37628": "Why not cut it?",
  "37629": "What does the letter mean, mother?",
  "37630": "Are we rising into a fiery furnace?",
  "37631": "What substances will you proscribe?",
  "37632": "And what method of surveillance do you employ?",
  "37633": "Oh, well, as it were, what?",
  "37634": "You think so?",
  "37635": "Of how much?",
  "37636": "Hardly remembered me?",
  "37637": "But we could not prevent it, could we?",
  "37638": "You get your percentage out o' the purchase, I suppose?",
  "37639": "Food enough for all?",
  "37640": "Why doesn't she want it now?",
  "37641": "On the other hand, would he not, by remaining to meet a fate almost inevitable, incur the guilt of suicide?",
  "37642": "Has she told you she likes me much?",
  "37643": "Why should I envy them?",
  "37644": "What did he say to you?",
  "37645": "But if he were taken back again he would imagine, and truly imagine, that he was descending?",
  "37646": "My friend, my friend, why thus grieve me?",
  "37647": "How does that strike you?",
  "37648": "Forty pounds?",
  "37649": "You'll have to, then, won't you?",
  "37650": "But I mean another piece?",
  "37651": "Are all voters enlightened?",
  "37652": "And his level, whether higher or lower, could it possibly be the same as hers?",
  "37653": "What makes you so sure?",
  "37654": "What is it in the nature of the oak that causes it to send its root down into the soil and to drink up of its substance?",
  "37655": "What's he going to read?",
  "37656": "Where shall I go?",
  "37657": "What was the primitive tissue?",
  "37658": "How much do you pay a week?",
  "37659": "Why shouldn't I conscientiously?",
  "37660": "And he is named?",
  "37661": "How came you by the knowledge?",
  "37662": "Is it not one part of honesty to be dutiful and grateful to your master, do you think?",
  "37663": "Why not win to freedom?",
  "37664": "Does he?",
  "37665": "And if not in the worst, why is it to follow at all?",
  "37666": "What, pray?",
  "37667": "Wherefore?",
  "37668": "But how have they endeavored to explain these lines of light?",
  "37669": "Shall I be that?",
  "37670": "And what shall we say of such things as religious duties, of cheerfulness, of good manners, of personal cleanliness?",
  "37671": "Or, have you been a bad steward to yourself, and wasted your property in lawsuits and the like?",
  "37672": "Ah, who put it up?",
  "37673": "But light?",
  "37674": "What has opened her eyes?",
  "37675": "Do you want him?",
  "37676": "It's red, ain't it?",
  "37677": "And would you indeed damn your precious soul?",
  "37678": "Well, did you see her safely off?",
  "37679": "But is he engaged to her?",
  "37680": "Why, how are all the folks at home?",
  "37681": "Are these persons, then, so rich and powerful?",
  "37682": "Can it give heat to a dead body?",
  "37683": "Don't you think so?",
  "37684": "Where's the use of looking nice, when no one sees me but those cross midgets, and no one cares whether I'm pretty or not?",
  "37685": "And the king has seen the cardinal?",
  "37686": "Detain him?",
  "37687": "And return to life, if there be such a thing, is the birth of the dead into the world of the living?",
  "37688": "Or do you also hate the duke your husband?",
  "37689": "Do you know who it is from?",
  "37690": "Have you been to the opera?",
  "37691": "Not a word to your loving mother, who was growing older too?",
  "37692": "Would you be at ease, and feel that you had played an open part?",
  "37693": "Has your majesty no other orders to give me?",
  "37694": "But what are you going to do with him, now he is alive?",
  "37695": "And what shall I do when papa and you leave me, and I am by myself?",
  "37696": "Why is he sleeping there?",
  "37697": "Had he not told her, yes, told her to make a list, and not to admit anyone who was not on that list?",
  "37698": "Were her fears realized?",
  "37699": "I suppose it bowled the poor blighter over absolutely?",
  "37700": "Who introduced this innovation?",
  "37701": "You are perhaps a tulip fancier?",
  "37702": "May I go in and look?",
  "37703": "When will we be married?",
  "37704": "You're in the habit of shaking hands?",
  "37705": "And which is wise and which is foolish?",
  "37706": "But then he had the woman he loved still remaining?",
  "37707": "Shall I then?",
  "37708": "All ready forward?",
  "37709": "Is there any one here?",
  "37710": "But can such a head be found?",
  "37711": "And ten?",
  "37712": "Do you think if I drink water it would take off this hiccup?",
  "37713": "And this one opposite, who is this?",
  "37714": "Neither may they imitate smiths or other artificers, or oarsmen, or boatswains, or the like?",
  "37715": "You'll be ready this day week, will you?",
  "37716": "What was become of them?",
  "37717": "Shall we gather strength but irresolution and inaction?",
  "37718": "And what was in the sealed iron chest?",
  "37719": "Shall I put a little more tea in the pot afore I go, ma'am?",
  "37720": "And what can you conceive more deadly?",
  "37721": "Why did you do it?",
  "37722": "What does she want?",
  "37723": "How do you know about it, and who are you, anyhow?",
  "37724": "What next?",
  "37725": "Deserted?",
  "37726": "When did you get in?",
  "37727": "Will it hit us?",
  "37728": "Do you want to be doing the same?",
  "37729": "Who will bring us bread?",
  "37730": "My friend, what do you tell me?",
  "37731": "Their whistle?",
  "37732": "Where in the world did you get that song?",
  "37733": "Is he very clever?",
  "37734": "Fine stepper, wasn't she?",
  "37735": "Who did I get the statues from?",
  "37736": "Will you have some whiskey and water?",
  "37737": "What news?",
  "37738": "And am I not a hundred times better thus?",
  "37739": "Struck me?",
  "37740": "And you are up?",
  "37741": "What point?",
  "37742": "Don't you know me?",
  "37743": "What is the use of one horse for us two?",
  "37744": "The cardinal was your protector?",
  "37745": "Isn't it splendid to be that kind, teacher?",
  "37746": "Are the other camels better or worse than that?",
  "37747": "Isn't what they have done already enough?",
  "37748": "What two lines?",
  "37749": "At twenty minutes to nine?",
  "37750": "Whom have I to love?",
  "37751": "And the rocks with their various strata?",
  "37752": "Did I not say right?",
  "37753": "What could he, an old man, do?",
  "37754": "And now what does he do?",
  "37755": "Is he so?",
  "37756": "And would it not be the height of absurdity to call such a man fickle and inconsistent, because he had repeatedly altered his judgment?",
  "37757": "Can't you comprehend that an affection may be genuine as felt by the man, yet its nature be spurious in relation to others?",
  "37758": "Then, at all events, he DID sleep here, did he?",
  "37759": "My name?",
  "37760": "And why should I not?",
  "37761": "How could I escape from this situation?",
  "37762": "Don't you know what it means to me?",
  "37763": "Which was the more important, which the less important part?",
  "37764": "You call them that, too?",
  "37765": "But by what means?",
  "37766": "Not come yet?",
  "37767": "Ever hear of lones the packer, hey, ole chappie?",
  "37768": "Is it quite original?",
  "37769": "Did he do that?",
  "37770": "Why should he trust himself to a balloon, that would blaze up like a piece of paper?",
  "37771": "Now, an't it?",
  "37772": "And don't I suppose his was the first face she saw, as she passed through the storm and the night to that waiting, beautiful place?",
  "37773": "You saw it?",
  "37774": "Like him?",
  "37775": "Would you take a seat, sir?",
  "37776": "And yet what else am I to do?",
  "37777": "Well, have you heard from your husband lately, my dear?",
  "37778": "You refused him?",
  "37779": "How did you know that?",
  "37780": "Can she make your real flecky paste, as melts in your mouth, and lies all up like a puff?",
  "37781": "Whence comes this?",
  "37782": "Yes, what is it?",
  "37783": "Should he stay at home with her, her mother and her sisters?",
  "37784": "What can I do to prevent it?",
  "37785": "Have been brought together, eh?",
  "37786": "Would you like to come up and see her?",
  "37787": "What would you like to do tomorrow?",
  "37788": "Will that arrangement suit you?",
  "37789": "And you shall be included in it, in our happiness, do you hear, father?",
  "37790": "FLOATED?",
  "37791": "Have you eaten anything?",
  "37792": "How d'you know I want to travel?",
  "37793": "Did she feel as he did?",
  "37794": "Water to drink?",
  "37795": "You will not serve me, sir, will you?",
  "37796": "How should he be?",
  "37797": "Again, has he greater experience of the pleasures of honour, or the lover of honour of the pleasures of wisdom?",
  "37798": "Is it nothing to hold one's peace?",
  "37799": "And you can do nothing until then?",
  "37800": "When, where?",
  "37801": "Is there generally?",
  "37802": "Yes, but still all this has to be looked after, and who is there to look after it?",
  "37803": "You a chief, eh?",
  "37804": "How much will you give me for it?",
  "37805": "What have I to say to them?",
  "37806": "Now what do you think on't, neighbour, my friend?",
  "37807": "When are you coming back?",
  "37808": "Can anyone be surprised if one gets fond of such a ship?",
  "37809": "Oh, not her?",
  "37810": "But what is worship?",
  "37811": "Why do you not speak to me?",
  "37812": "In arms against me?",
  "37813": "Do you wish for a proof?",
  "37814": "I can't say more than that, can I?",
  "37815": "Where, then?",
  "37816": "Prove?",
  "37817": "Little woman?",
  "37818": "Shall it be said, good reader?",
  "37819": "Are you glad to leave us, dear?",
  "37820": "What had that harsh tyrant of hers done that was good or serviceable for her?",
  "37821": "And the mistress?",
  "37822": "Can one be well while suffering morally?",
  "37823": "Where would be that thrill if I had been as definite as a timetable?",
  "37824": "How long otherwise?",
  "37825": "Tony, where are you going, my charmer?",
  "37826": "What does this tell us?",
  "37827": "How does she use you?",
  "37828": "Have you nothing else to ask him, sir?",
  "37829": "In the nick of time?",
  "37830": "How?",
  "37831": "Mind it?",
  "37832": "How can I help myself?",
  "37833": "Where has he gone?",
  "37834": "That visit not succeeding either, you will go again perhaps?",
  "37835": "Husband, are you as kind and gentle toward your wife as you should be?",
  "37836": "For what is death?",
  "37837": "If I see, clearly see, that ladder leading from plant to man, why should I suppose it breaks off at me and does not go farther and farther?",
  "37838": "Lively?",
  "37839": "Another glass?",
  "37840": "But the great point is, is there a 'Rita' on the list?",
  "37841": "Don't you hear?",
  "37842": "What was the difference whether the alms were given into my hands or into my wife's?",
  "37843": "Do you tell me that the woman is dead?",
  "37844": "Did he take that medicine, men?",
  "37845": "Who would suppose it?",
  "37846": "When was that done which settled the matter?",
  "37847": "What did you say, sir?",
  "37848": "Well and what am I to do now?",
  "37849": "I couldn't do anything better for her than advise her to accept these proposals, could I?",
  "37850": "What would be the result of a total extraction of the nitrogen?",
  "37851": "Do you not suspect?",
  "37852": "Did it keep you awake?",
  "37853": "Did he think that pride or masterful will or physical strength would help him?",
  "37854": "Need any help, officer?",
  "37855": "What's the row now?",
  "37856": "Why are you so bad?",

  "38033": "For your own credit and for the sake of money, of course?",
  "38034": "Is this, also, some enchanted person?",
  "38035": "But what was it?",
  "38036": "I mean to say, what?",
  "38037": "Ha, friend?",
  "38038": "And what about his wife and family?",
  "38039": "Is it necessary that a bourgeoisie which stands in such need of you should disown you?",
  "38040": "Suppose he were taken prisoner again?",
  "38041": "Now, my good fellow, how are you?",
  "38042": "She was about to say?",

  "38057": "Was there any mention made of my uncle or me?",
  "38058": "In what does it consist?",
  "38059": "Then I am not to be allowed to have anything to do with it officially?",
  "38060": "Can I go, can I go?",
  "38061": "You won't mind my working in your room this afternoon, will you?",
  "38062": "Is she a friend of yours?",
  "38063": "Or will you be my friend, as you have been hitherto, and do what I request?",

  "38065": "What is that queer concern going down the river?",
  "38066": "Are you sure he can't get away?",
  "38067": "Was that all she said I said?",
  "38068": "But how cast off all the superfluous, devilish burden of my outer man?",
  "38069": "Why then is that rather a misfortune than this a good fortune?",
  "38070": "There now, what is it?",
  "38071": "Anything in the gruff and grumble way?",
  "38072": "Don't natur herself kinder cry out on 'em?",

  "38084": "Gone?",
  "38085": "Where had you seen me before?",
  "38086": "And if she won't tell?",
  "38087": "And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a fait accompli?",
  "38088": "And to sign the contract in three days?",
  "38089": "Could it be that the unfortunate man had committed suicide, overcome by his troubles?",
  "38090": "And that is your opinion?",
  "38091": "Can one?",
  "38092": "Was it wonderful that I was misanthropic and sullen?",

  "38102": "Why should my courtesie to these knights go all for naught?",
  "38103": "Was I, then, a monster, a blot upon the earth, from which all men fled and whom all men disowned?",
  "38104": "Could the latter for a moment suppose that the son would not offer the best part to the father?",
  "38105": "Why should she be sorry?",
  "38106": "And so?",
  "38107": "Seek introductions, draw petitions up?",
  "38108": "How do we know what is at the bottom of his sudden interest in you?",
  "38109": "Wherefore?",
  "38110": "How do you account for this?",
  "38111": "And on what occasions have such favors been bestowed upon you?",
  "38112": "Do you think that will be really necessary?",
  "38113": "Any other letters?",
  "38114": "And where the prudence now that awed mankind?",

  "38122": "What on earth are we to do with him?",
  "38123": "Should you like to sleep?",
  "38124": "Why, it may be asked, has the supposed creative force produced bats and no other mammals on remote islands?",
  "38125": "Should he not have a regard for his health and efficiency?",
  "38126": "Shall I tell you each ornament of your toilet?",
  "38127": "How does he get it, then?",
  "38128": "Can it be believed that they would thus act to no purpose during their courtship?",
  "38129": "How know you this man has?",
  "38130": "What has not fired her bosom or her brain?",
  "38131": "You aren't angry, are you?",
  "38132": "From whence, I ask, could he gain that knowledge, but from the study of the true theology?",
  "38133": "Was there ever such a sober, sentimental interview?",
  "38134": "And as it is to so go at all events, may we not agree that the sooner the better?",
  "38135": "Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?",
  "38136": "And why were you not willing?",
  "38137": "Are you so and so?",
  "38138": "Come, now, tell me, you want me very much to stay, don't you?",
  "38139": "Have you forgotten that I ordered you to remain in bed when I saw you the other day?",
  "38140": "May I suppose that you have this distinction of the visible and intelligible fixed in your mind?",
  "38141": "What's the good of getting away?",
  "38142": "Is it not adherence to the old and tried, against the new and untried?",
  "38143": "What can I do?",
  "38144": "Are or are not our interests conflicting?",
  "38145": "And by whom were they recommended to you?",
  "38146": "Paid according to the labor that they had performed, of what could they complain?",
  "38147": "What would his guards think if they heard him shout like a madman?",
  "38148": "How about the lion and the lioness?",
  "38149": "Don't you see her?",
  "38150": "Had they been heard?",
  "38151": "You are pleased it is a girl?",
  "38152": "Why should not schools be established, a comfortable hotel be erected, a church be built?",
  "38153": "What the devil is the meaning of all this?",

  "39042": "Anybody been here, sir?",
  "39043": "How deeply did they wound me when they deprived me of your friendship?",
  "39044": "You had never anything to complain of?",
  "39045": "You got anything to play music on?",
  "39046": "And the writing?",
  "39047": "So you shun me?",
  "39048": "How do you find yourself, sir?",
  "39049": "My husband is asleep, why do you come to disturb his glorious rest?",

  "39052": "What is peace?",
  "39053": "Nothing broken?",
  "39054": "Why afraid?",
  "39055": "It was not as she said?",
  "39056": "You gave him our address at least?",
  "39057": "And has he asked for the sacrament?",
  "39058": "Is she asleep?",
  "39059": "How many roubles do you want?",
  "39060": "You saw him, sir?",

  "39083": "And all that?",
  "39084": "Is there any secret meaning concealed beneath your words?",
  "39085": "For a time, you mean?",
  "39086": "Have I been false to her, through strict fidelity to you, and sacrificed my friendship to keep my love inviolate?",

  "39131": "What is the chief difference?",
  "39132": "What does it matter if your picture is good or bad?",
  "39133": "What, then, have I to fear from him?",

  "39136": "Is this he?",
  "39137": "When is it to be?",
  "39138": "Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it?",
  "39139": "On the bridge?",
  "39140": "And you've no doubt what you shall do, if they come?",

  "39142": "Have we no tendency to the latter condition?",
  "39143": "See thot?",
  "39144": "Shall I now accept his perfidious friendship?",
  "39145": "Do yon know, they have positively threatened to kill me unless I bring the rain?",
  "39146": "Now then, what do you say to that?",
  "39147": "Who, I, sir?",
  "39148": "But don't you, my dear, really feel it?",
  "39149": "What is there in the language of that speech which expresses such purpose or bears such construction?",
  "39150": "But perhaps you can never believe, now, that there is anything human in my heart?",
  "39151": "WHY are you?",
  "39152": "You don't think they've gone to sea, anyhow?",
  "39153": "Consumption, was it?",

  "39155": "I knew that, did I?",
  "39156": "Could you run a hotel in the city?",
  "39157": "Will I?",
  "39158": "In order to spare your tears am I to commit these crimes?",
  "39159": "Why is it necessary to imprison me, to convince me of it?",
  "39160": "Whereas the bad and ignorant will desire to gain more than both?",
  "39161": "You'll be goin' off naow, won't ye?",
  "39162": "Have I understood you rightly?",
  "39163": "Tell me, could you think any thing less?",
  "39164": "For how many causes may a man be divorced, nephew?",
  "39165": "Have you come to me at such an early morning hour?",
  "39166": "You didn't see, all the while?",
  "39167": "You will not exclude me from your confidence if you admit me to your heart?",
  "39168": "Why don't you stay here and I'll get rid of that damned fool with his mumps?",
  "39169": "As long as he has liquor and good pay, why should he ask questions?",
  "39170": "How long was it before you went to bed?",
  "39171": "Oh, you in front, what is blocking the way?",
  "39172": "He started by and by as if he were just then awakened, and asked who that was, and what was the matter?",
  "39173": "What are all the records of history, but narratives of successive villanies, of treasons and usurpations, massacres and wars?",
  "39174": "But how, sir, shall we dispose of you?",
  "39175": "All ready there, forward?",
  "39176": "That he may be ready?",

  "39186": "Would the two, for his enlightenment, try to ascertain just what they had in common, and why they belonged to the same party?",
  "39187": "Should you go on that plan?",
  "39188": "If this development is equal, how is the power of reproduction lessened?",
  "39189": "It is in this direction, and I could come any afternoon by train for half an hour?",
  "39190": "Then why should I not go to his chambers?",
  "39191": "What do you want here?",
  "39192": "Why lie sprawling about the deck like this?",
  "39193": "By what authority?",
  "39194": "Who's a going to try?",
  "39195": "You know no good of the fellow?",
  "39196": "But after all, why not?",
  "39197": "You would not be very angry, would you?",
  "39198": "No accident, I hope?",
  "39199": "And educated?",
  "39200": "My lord?",
  "39201": "In our times that is worth something, isn't it?",
  "39202": "But who was the cause of my doing so?",
  "39203": "Why should I go back?",
  "39204": "As for you, what have you done of those things that are recommended by our legislator?",

  "39215": "The mistake arose out of my card, did it?",
  "39216": "How would you like to work for me?",
  "39217": "Pray, are you aware that the king has no money in his treasury?",
  "39218": "I, indeed?",
  "39219": "Gedge?",
  "39220": "What things?",
  "39221": "Is the king dead?",

  "39267": "Are your eyes troubling you?",
  "39268": "Why did we not find it sooner?",
  "39269": "A book in the library?",

  "39368": "But why?",
  "39369": "How can such a person be the master of things?",
  "39370": "Ah, go away, dummy, how about the girls?",

  "41041": "Can you give me any circumstances or particulars?",
  "41042": "What was he waiting for?",
  "41043": "Is it good news?",
  "41044": "Besides, what object could the creature have for this extraordinary deception?",
  "41045": "Cut?",
  "41046": "But are you SURE?",
  "41047": "Shall we see you tomorrow to dinner?",
  "41048": "You live in their milieu?",
  "41049": "What have I to strive and toil for?",
  "41050": "And will you call it being against you, if the queen does not choose you for her confessor?",
  "41051": "Oh, that's this missionary?",
  "41052": "Will you disclose the whole?",
  "41053": "What's all this fuss?",
  "41054": "What ails you?",
  "41055": "How shall I moil 'em?",
  "41056": "What, then, is the alternative?",
  "41057": "What could sadden him thus?",
  "41058": "But could he trust himself?",
  "41059": "Is this country good for cattle?",
  "41060": "What say I?",
  "41061": "Why did they lure me there?",
  "41062": "Would you have that question reduced to its former proportions?",
  "41063": "Does he say that, papa?",
  "41064": "Do you not think that, as a daughter, I am right?",
  "41065": "How shall I go about in quest of a wight whom I know not and whom, if I saw him face to face, I should not know?",
  "41066": "Are you trying to, play pranks on an old man?",
  "41067": "Their virtue, their justice, their power?",

  "41080": "Shall we go into dinner?",
  "41081": "How did you hear that?",
  "41082": "Lynde?",
  "41083": "For of what use would this precaution be, if there were nothing to gain by it?",

  "41090": "And how shall I travel, then?",
  "41091": "Oh, you agree, do you?",
  "41092": "Was he by himself?",

  "41104": "Is it a simple matter to keep silence?",
  "41105": "You have no faith in me?",
  "41106": "Is it any wonder that it rests with us now, with a bewildering sense of some power outside ourselves or our comprehension?",

  "41111": "Are you quite alone, this year?",
  "41112": "Have I not given you to understand that, for a while at least, I would prefer to keep the contents of this epistle to myself?",
  "41113": "Can you say so?",
  "41114": "None of ye has been stealing what didn't belong to him?",
  "41115": "And here he proposed articles to you, I understand?",
  "41116": "The slab which closes the vault?",
  "41117": "How are matches made, except by bringing men and women together?",
  "41118": "Well, anyway, what ARE we going to do?",
  "41119": "But who is to carry you, said she, to your father and mother?",
  "41120": "You have nothing more to say?",
  "41121": "Who counsels best?",
  "41122": "What's the best place to stay at for the night round here?",
  "41123": "But whether made by one side or the other, would each side enjoy equal advantages on the trial?",
  "41124": "Not fear of the thunder, surely?",
  "41125": "Do you know he is a convict, a felon, a common thief?",
  "41126": "Who should know if I don't?",
  "41127": "For what do they commemorate as concerns you and myself?",
  "41128": "Meaning that you saw none?",
  "41129": "Work?",
  "41130": "Were you much hurt?",
  "41131": "Do you still think you found somebody fairer?",
  "41132": "Did he steal?",
  "41133": "Doesn't he feel important?",
  "41134": "What stage have they reached, sir?",
  "41135": "Will no one come?",
  "41136": "Well, what?",
  "41137": "Had he a whip in his hand?",
  "41138": "When was there ever a time when he had experienced happiness, felt a true bliss?",
  "41139": "He hadn't any money, had he?",
  "41140": "But can you not say that, sir?",
  "41141": "Why should I go back?",
  "41142": "Do you know what he did, sir?",
  "41143": "How far now can this negative mode of proceeding be carried?",
  "41144": "Why should you?",
  "41145": "And do you see that other one, who has an eagle and a dragon painted side by side upon his shield?",
  "41146": "Whence then was thy back created?",
  "41147": "Can I speak plainer?",
  "41148": "Who sent it?",
  "41149": "Will not a small body and a large one float the same way under the same influence?",
  "41150": "Can you give us any reason why we should not put you to death?",
  "41151": "Why had no word of any kind come from him?",
  "41152": "Made by whom?",
  "41153": "Have blows passed?",
  "41154": "And why was I so furious about it?",
  "41155": "Now, who was that someone?",
  "41156": "Who told you so?",
  "41157": "And can't we have a good time, too?",
  "41158": "How long is this thing going on like this?",
  "41159": "How much did it cost him?",
  "41160": "How are we today?",
  "41161": "Need I recall either the scene or the national circumstances attending the occasion?",
  "41162": "You're ready, are you?",
  "41163": "Of whom speak you?",
  "41164": "Do you know?",
  "41165": "What am I saying?",
  "41166": "Might not that influence be altogether disastrous?",
  "41167": "What shall I say of this man?",
  "41168": "Why don't you go on?",
  "41169": "Is it not the impiety of the inhabitants?",
  "41170": "Was he carrying a hat?",
  "41171": "Wasn't it, my wife?",
  "41172": "Can't you see you've wiped out everything?",
  "41173": "And the lustful and tyrannical desires are, as we saw, at the greatest distance?",
  "41174": "Who's there?",
  "41175": "And hundreds been deprived of their horses and their arms?",
  "41176": "When do you desire to go?",
  "41177": "The associate?",
  "41178": "But to whom, then?",
  "41179": "You feel strong enough to walk a little way now?",
  "41180": "What odds in that?",
  "41181": "And do you imagine he realizes all the awfulness of my position?",
  "41182": "Is the world, then, so narrow?",
  "41183": "Didn't you know that?",
  "41184": "When did music come this way?",
  "41185": "And what means have you to suggest, may I ask?",
  "41186": "What have we here?",
  "41187": "A spy?",
  "41188": "What are you worrying for, so long as he has money?",
  "41189": "Why did you ask me?",
  "41190": "What did these sealed mysterious letters bring him?",
  "41191": "How long will it take you to make up your mind?",
  "41192": "How of the window?",
  "41193": "And what did she for you?",
  "41194": "Well, how is your district council doing?",
  "41195": "Ought we not, then, to put our virtue and fortitude to the severest tests?",
  "41196": "May you come to me?",
  "41197": "What was his affair?",
  "41198": "Are you a magician?",
  "41199": "How long is it?",
  "41200": "Should you think all that pleasant enough if I forgave you?",
  "41201": "Were not these madmen common enough in such a prison?",
  "41202": "Of HIM?",
  "41203": "Where yeh hit?",
  "41204": "Is he hurt badly?",
  "41205": "What the devil is it all about?",
  "41206": "Does he now say that he did not make that promise?",
  "41207": "What was his name?",
  "41208": "Ferguson?",
  "41209": "Can it be that he was ashamed of me?",
  "41210": "Is it true, mother?",
  "41211": "Whither?",
  "41212": "But you prefer playing other people's accompaniments, to singing yourself, don't you?",
  "41213": "Shall I open the secretary?",
  "41214": "In what respect, madame?",
  "41215": "But what is an energumen?",
  "41216": "Who is it bids me hold?",
  "41217": "May I ask where you have taken up your quarters?",
  "41218": "Or, indeed, I might perhaps get a clerkship in a merchant's office?",
  "41219": "Are you a merchant?",
  "41220": "What injury?",
  "41221": "Did I startle you?",
  "41222": "The horse?",
  "41223": "Where did you get THAT idea from?",
  "41224": "Have you ever seen a man hanged?",
  "41225": "Not even your aunt?",
  "41226": "Why did you not tell me?",
  "41227": "Do you recall her features distinctly?",
  "41228": "At such a tender age could he have been conscious of his uncle's superiority to all those who surrounded him?",
  "41229": "She had a son, that unhappy woman?",
  "41230": "What was the occasion of this excited assemblage?",
  "41231": "But at a tremendous discount, of course?",
  "41232": "You wish to speak to me about the circumstance which has just happened?",
  "41233": "Was I not just telling you I despised it?",
  "41234": "How has this been proved?",
  "41235": "Do you mind?",
  "41236": "What does it say?",
  "41237": "Then this table is free?",
  "41238": "Who raised the money?",
  "41239": "And what might you think?",
  "41240": "Perhaps you dislike it?",
  "41241": "You see all these bags at the back of my cart?",

  "41245": "I then asked him what he intended to do with the knife which had been found upon him?",
  "41246": "Have you ever noticed how much a thing is heightened in value when we obtain possession of it?",
  "41247": "I wish it would snow, don't you?",
  "41248": "But why should he go through the ceremony if he is not to live with her?",
  "41249": "Oh, is that it?",
  "41250": "How can wealth that is not measured by labor be VALUABLE?",
  "41251": "I do not know?",
  "41252": "And how could he know that I should be such a simpleton as to believe him?",
  "41253": "Are you so unsociable that you cannot make friends?",
  "41254": "Repeal this statute, my good sir?",
  "41255": "Will you make up your mind at last?",
  "41256": "Do I not know human nature?",
  "41257": "Must I wrap them up?",
  "41258": "Why fear these titles, why this chieftain's strength?",
  "41259": "If he was going to treat her like that why did he ask her to come and live at the flat?",
  "41260": "But how can I send him away, since I have given him a rendezvous?",
  "41261": "H'm?",
  "41262": "Ever so far?",
  "41263": "What are you doing there?",
  "41264": "And how have I broken that treaty, your excellency?",
  "41265": "Is it true that eight hundred have been sent from us already?",
  "41266": "How are you, old fellow?",
  "41267": "Sister?",
  "41268": "Is it credible that the possessions of the spirit can be bequeathed at all?",
  "41269": "No misfortune has happened to the queen?",
  "41270": "You advise me, then, to be reconciled to the abbe?",
  "41271": "You too come to see them off?",
  "41272": "What is the meaning of yonder singular building?",
  "41273": "Have you brought his indentures with you?",
  "41274": "From whence, then, came this prostration?",
  "41275": "Is not ambition but an endless ladder by which no height is ever climbed till the last unreachable rung is mounted?",
  "41276": "Are you staying to talk?",
  "41277": "In what relation must she salute you as her uncle, or as her husband?",
  "41278": "Do the races or species of men, whichever term may be applied, encroach on and replace one another, so that some finally become extinct?",
  "41279": "Don't you realise that you're enjoying a very rare, a very exquisite privilege?",
  "41280": "Your crime?",
  "41281": "What have I been waiting for?",
  "41282": "Morrel?",
  "41283": "Or what does she mean?",
  "41284": "Has he got the financial basis arranged then?",
  "41285": "A little?",
  "41286": "Who goes there, yourselves?",
  "41287": "Will nothing of it remain?",
  "41288": "What will we get?",

  "41298": "My heart, who is there upon earth that I could miss so much?",
  "41299": "If it is I you do love, O how can it be that you look and speak so?",
  "41300": "Shall I clamber across, or will you come to the plank above here?",
  "41301": "Have they calculated upon the inevitable consequences of this abdication?",
  "41302": "Plural?",
  "41303": "Why no king?",
  "41304": "Why had her family cast her off?",
  "41305": "And what will you do in that case?",
  "41306": "Why?",

  "42629": "And will that save my unhappy men?",
  "42630": "This is justum impedimentum, I hope, error personae?",
  "42631": "Had his father not also suffered the same pain for him, which he now suffered for his son?",
  "42632": "Well, and to you?",
  "42633": "Could they have made a confidante of the woman?",

  "42713": "Why didn't you say who YOU were?",
  "42714": "Should I stop the service and make a scene in the church?",
  "42715": "I may count on you, may I not, and quickly?",
  "42716": "But tell me, how should this be possible?",
  "42717": "How much may it come to?",
  "42718": "Ye preach patience with what is earthly?",
  "42719": "And you laid the foundation of your fortune in the midst of all those songs?",
  "42720": "Would it be a very hard lesson, dear?",
  "42721": "But how did you become concerned in this villainous affair?",
  "42722": "What do you say to this, mother?",

  "42724": "Or else?",
  "42725": "But who are your captains?",
  "42726": "You're not going to marry him, do you hear?",
  "42727": "How are you and your swell friend making it?",
  "42728": "Is that how you look at it?",
  "42729": "Seriously, can that be applied to a man of income, who has no other possession under the sun than the market, and in his pocket his money?",
  "42730": "Whereabouts were his former haunts?",
  "42731": "Will you stop smiling in that inscrutable way and tell me what you mean?",
  "42732": "Whose is that letter of your mistress?",

  "42746": "Dern your skin, ain't the company good enough for you?",
  "42747": "What should one love and what hate?",
  "42748": "If it was true, why was it not writ till five days after the proclamation?",
  "42749": "Or because a man is in good health when he receives pay you would not say that the art of payment is medicine?",
  "42750": "Why are you so glum?",
  "42751": "Even among the poor, who would willingly marry the child of a man who had been hanged?",
  "42752": "Who and what are you, and why are you here?",

  "42768": "Where was there any proof to the contrary?",
  "42769": "Oh, what's that?",
  "42770": "Did you fall from heaven?",
  "42771": "Is it not a greater service to place souls in heaven than to bury bodies in the earth?",

  "42782": "Are you satisfied, sir?",
  "42783": "S'pose you're the person we go into camp for, eh?",
  "42784": "A he, is it?",
  "42785": "Whither wanders thy distemper'd mind?",
  "42786": "You surely don't think of mounting a mass like that upon a carriage?",
  "42787": "You don't care to oblige us?",
  "42788": "What was his name?",
  "42789": "How can she write letters to HER, if she's mad?",

  "42792": "Had you no mother?",
  "42793": "And what do you believe?",
  "42794": "My shadow calleth me?",
  "42795": "Not in this place, surely?",
  "42796": "Did not your majesty say so?",
  "42797": "Have I your leave to go, dear?",
  "42798": "But are your beliefs, we should ask, based on historical fact?",
  "42799": "Tell me what?",
  "42800": "Well, wouldn't I rather be the fool I am, than that flea downstairs?",
  "42801": "Glory waits our toil?",
  "42802": "Am I queer?",
  "42803": "So much?",
  "42804": "So that you may be avoided?",

  "42857": "She curled her hair and showed her shoulders at him, as much as to say, did ye ever see such jet ringlets and such a complexion?",
  "42858": "What was the noblest life that perished there?",
  "42859": "Isn't it splendid of him?",
  "42860": "Now what shall I do?",
  "42861": "All sorts of mornings are interesting, don't you think?",
  "42862": "Never?",
  "42863": "For example, I said, can the same thing be at rest and in motion at the same time in the same part?",
  "42864": "Think ye it is because of the affection she bears me?",

  "42890": "What heavenly particle inspires the clay?",
  "42891": "Is all else bare?",
  "42892": "The question is, how is that object to be attained?",
  "42893": "Or would the sight of it bring recollections calculated to enervate and distress?",
  "42894": "But what is he ferreting for?",
  "42895": "Who dares at my court be a protector of heretics?",
  "42896": "Will we ever get there?",
  "42897": "Is that far, sir?",
  "42898": "Is it thus you perform your charge, monsieur?",
  "42899": "Where I am going to be married?",
  "42900": "But there has been some official investigation?",
  "42901": "Do you not think that they have sent for you, both for the same thing?",

  "42931": "What say you?",
  "42932": "And leave the person to whom one gives the thing, you mean, to discover it?",
  "42933": "In what state was the house when you left?",
  "42934": "Would that make the navigation better or worse?",
  "42935": "Can't I talk with you any more?",
  "42936": "Electricity?",
  "42937": "For, in short, if it were not he, who could it be?",
  "42938": "Do you know him, then?",
  "42939": "If all our institutions are based upon an error in calculation, does it not follow that these institutions are so many shams?",
  "42940": "And how are you, my dear boy?",
  "42941": "Oh, what can I say?",
  "42942": "I suppose if at ten they must be either wounded or killed, mustn't they?",
  "42943": "But is the old min agreeable?",
  "42944": "Does the author promise a second part at all?",
  "42945": "What was it we were talking about?",
  "42946": "And who is to pay him?",
  "42947": "Can you stand?",
  "42948": "Shall I assume that we ourselves are able and experienced judges and have before now met with such a person?",
  "42949": "Will you hazard so desperate a step while there is any possibility that any portion of the ills you fly from have no real existence?",
  "42950": "Isn't it rather dangerous, the way you drive?",
  "42951": "MUST a name mean something?",
  "42952": "He did not believe a word of the story, and yet, how discredit or disprove it?",

  "42959": "But with what shall I reward him?",
  "42960": "Pretty well swelled out, an't he?",
  "42961": "Take it out?",
  "42962": "And how many were there of these linen drapers?",
  "42963": "But will you allow me for one minute to take my supposition for granted?",
  "42964": "How, then?",
  "42965": "And have you not been to bed?",
  "42966": "But what did you do while it was raining?",
  "42967": "And, when the ghost speaks to you, what does he say?",
  "42968": "Pedringano?",
  "42969": "Kept her, on that sweet construction, to be his mistress?",

  "43007": "But what do you expect?",
  "43008": "But why does anybody care about him?",
  "43009": "What do you fear?",
  "43010": "In the first place, you will sup with me, will you not?",
  "43011": "Was he aware, in short, that the entire motions of the terrestrial sphere had undergone a complete modification?",
  "43012": "Wouldn't you have a master for your castle in the air?",
  "43013": "But could anyone possibly eat sixty monks?",

  "46008": "Among the patrons, I suppose?",
  "46009": "What is thy name?",
  "46010": "Am I, then, so very revolting?",
  "46011": "Ought I to vanish?",

  "46027": "But you still know each other?",
  "46028": "But in what does a strong association between a word and an idea differ from a weak one?",
  "46029": "And wha will glove my hand?",

  "46049": "You are great friends, eh, all together?",
  "46050": "Do you find any trouble or disquiet in your body by the importunate stings and pricklings of the flesh?",
  "46051": "What made your sons go to spring on my sons till my big son was killed by your children?",

  "46095": "Couldn't one get a book?",
  "46096": "Is the hand not always pointing there?",
  "46097": "Shouldn't they have been happy?",
  "46098": "But who was the spy who stole the papers?",
  "46099": "So it's 'Eat my dear birdies,' is it, young man?",
  "46100": "And yet the cardinal was attached to you?",
  "46101": "Can any woman alive believe you in earnest, or think you design anything but to banter her?",

  "46124": "What are their secret counsels?",
  "46125": "Who'll say a guinea?",
  "46126": "Do you think I particularly like you?",
  "46127": "Who is he, my dear?",
  "46128": "And did you?",
  "46129": "Shall I ever know any thing?",
  "46130": "Where is that murderer?",
  "46131": "Oh, is it broken?",
  "46132": "True, but saw you ever one more cool and assured?",
  "46133": "And is there no room for love there?",
  "46134": "For not alluding to your leaving us?",
  "46135": "What then must be the result?",
  "46136": "What is all settled?",
  "46137": "Saw you those meteors?",
  "46138": "And what will that good treatment be?",
  "46139": "Well, but is there any war on record which was carried on successfully by him, or aided by his counsels, when he was alive?",
  "46140": "Do you want a map?",
  "46141": "But what other is there?",
  "46142": "You understand the rest, then?",
  "46143": "You couldn't sing a comic song on the pony's back, could you?",
  "46144": "Where were we?",

  "46152": "How can I ever pay you?",
  "46153": "Give me one little sip more, and tell me from whom you received the noble gift?",
  "46154": "But the orders?",
  "46155": "How here?",
  "46156": "If I don't bring 'em here, what does it matter?",
  "46157": "Did he not, my dear father and mother, deserve all the truth to be told?",
  "46158": "You think that likely?",
  "46159": "Can we not better make the attempt after dark?",

  "46178": "How dare you say such things about me?",
  "46179": "Is it not true that legists are governed by caprice in giving and taking away rights?",
  "46180": "Will you go over and get some canned peaches?",
  "46181": "And you heard nothing, and saw nothing?",
  "46182": "When did he go to church last?",
  "46183": "Which then shall we prefer?",
  "46184": "What more inconstant than the desires of man?",
  "46185": "And you obeyed?",
  "46186": "Which should he take?",
  "46187": "What's the matter?",
  "46188": "Does it not make you shudder?",
  "46189": "What infernal noise?",

  "46599": "We can't take any of it with us, indeed?",
  "46600": "You were brought up by an uncle, then?",
  "46601": "Did she say that to me?",
  "46602": "These are, doubtless, your family arms?",
  "46603": "Was it to them an unknown island, ready to become a magazine for stolen cargoes?",
  "46604": "Then why not change it?",
  "46605": "Yours?",
  "46606": "Now who is it in this ship to whom the letters will be shown?",
  "46607": "What should not you mind?",
  "46608": "When will the gaoler bring us our pottage?",
  "46609": "Has she sat for it?",
  "46610": "But where are you going?",
  "46611": "James sweet on her, hey?",
  "46612": "Did anyone know that these proofs would be there?",
  "46613": "Oh, they was, eh?",
  "46614": "Is it mad yous are?",
  "46615": "WHAT do you think she'd do if she caught us?",
  "46616": "It can't be useless, or why should it be done?",
  "46617": "But how the devil would you have me retire on twelve hundred francs?",
  "46618": "Who can doubt this?",
  "46619": "Is he her father?",
  "46620": "Won't you drink a little?",
  "46621": "And is our theory a worse theory because we are unable to prove the possibility of a city being ordered in the manner described?",
  "46622": "How do, my dear?",
  "46623": "But, alas?",
  "46624": "What CAN I do?",
  "46625": "AUS WAS?",
  "46626": "How could they win him over to rejoin them?",
  "46627": "You lodge me in your house, close to yourself like this?",
  "46628": "Do you want me to help you or not?",
  "46629": "But why do you always grip your lips?",
  "46630": "Or that they, who see different and dissimilar parts, should judge differently from each other?",
  "46631": "But why should one take trouble to insist upon the advance of science and art in the medieval city?",
  "46632": "How should I not be?",
  "46633": "Hannah, is that milk?",
  "46634": "Would you rather have it in your room, or will you join us at our table d'hote?",
  "46635": "And what was his name?",
  "46636": "Who could have believed it?",
  "46637": "And you will call on that atheist?",
  "46638": "What cause have I to war at thy decree?",
  "46639": "Why don't you speak, cousin?",
  "46640": "You don't find your fancy kind o' lessening for this chap, do you?",
  "46641": "What need to make a long discourse of what followed?",
  "46642": "And it is?",
  "46643": "Will she not depart as suddenly as she came?",
  "46644": "Can I have also been like that?",
  "46645": "Can you count in your head?",
  "46646": "What was it that had sent him there, he wondered?",
  "46647": "To whom shall I yield me?",
  "46648": "Why, when, knaves?",
  "46649": "Why didn't I fight at sea?",
  "46650": "He was undone, for how could he ask the general for his place again?",
  "46651": "How did you know that I was a prisoner in that tent?",
  "46652": "And why are they bright so long after it is evening here?",
  "46653": "Where is mother?",
  "46654": "Who is?",
  "46655": "Who ran to catch me when I fell, and kissed the place to make it well?",
  "46656": "Do you hear sir?",
  "46657": "Do you know that passage?",
  "46658": "Does he wish to be a bishop?",
  "46659": "What brings you here?",
  "46660": "Can't you sit in by the hearth with the light lit and herself beyond in the room?",
  "46661": "I came, then, to inquire how monsieur had passed the night, and if monsieur intended to keep this apartment?",
  "46662": "Just now?",
  "46663": "And would not the chamberlains have a right to be vexed by it?",
  "46664": "Your majesty has the plan?",
  "46665": "By what right you dared send me those letters?",
  "46666": "Tomorrow?",
  "46667": "Seen her?",
  "46668": "What was that I was saying about denouncing myself?",
  "46669": "Have you got your divorce then?",
  "46670": "Why, what's the matter, trow?",
  "46671": "Monsieur would wish to see my camp, and witness for himself our numbers, and the impossibility of his resisting them with success?",
  "46672": "My friends, do you know what those creatures use for wads?",
  "46673": "Don't you know she has?",
  "46674": "Was it worth while, I asked myself, to invent such rubbish at such a moment?",
  "46675": "Is that long ago?",
  "46676": "Ernest was annoyed and surprised, for had not his father and mother been wanting him to be more religious all his life?",
  "46677": "What do you want?",
  "46678": "Oh, was it right my asking him to dinner?",
  "46679": "Will you cause that to be done for me?",
  "46680": "Was his whole life to be shown up as a useless sham a second time?",
  "46681": "Does that please you?",
  "46682": "Kingsford?",
  "46683": "What prevented it?",
  "46684": "Of what nature are they?",
  "46685": "Were they then so many?",
  "46686": "The solemn song be sung ?",
  "46687": "How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains?",
  "46688": "What's the matter, my dear?",
  "46689": "Where's the little scamp got to?",
  "46690": "All right?",
  "46691": "They don't throw 'em about in church, do they?",
  "46692": "Pardon for whom?",
  "46693": "What does it ALL mean?",
  "46694": "What are those men in those carts?",
  "46695": "Horrid little bird, why did it eat all my starch?",
  "46696": "Surely I was serious enough?",
  "46697": "But above all things, I am a marvel to you?",
  "46698": "Would you like to see them?",
  "46699": "Were you ever up there?",
  "46700": "Was it then that you found her again?",
  "46701": "Of what sort had been the life of the man who had stood for years at the top of a pillar?",
  "46702": "What do you think is the cause of so strange a sound?",
  "46703": "And, as it is our last evening together under quite the same circumstances as during all these weeks, will you agree to a plan of mine?",
  "46704": "Do you know that you have composed some of the most beautiful music in the world?",
  "46705": "Don't you think so?",
  "46706": "Were the distinction or separation of possessions entirely useless, can any one conceive, that it ever should have obtained in society?",
  "46707": "Yet, after all, what is there in it that should surprise us?",
  "46708": "What would you not tell her?",
  "46709": "Not by his daughter?",
  "46710": "Who wants them?",
  "46711": "Ah, why?",
  "46712": "There was a row, was there?",
  "46713": "It's you, is it, who played this trick on me?",
  "46714": "To my sister?",
  "46715": "What do you mean to do for me, old fellow?",
  "46716": "Which way are you walking, my love?",
  "46717": "You have, eh?",
  "46718": "You do not mean to say that I have persecuted her?",
  "46719": "What interest have they in your death?",
  "46720": "Is it you, my dear master?",
  "46721": "What the devil made you stand lingering there, in the wet?",
  "46722": "Oh, that's the name of the song, is it?",
  "46723": "Do you know how to sew?",
  "46724": "What do you mean by locking the door when decent people come to call upon us?",
  "46725": "Was a miner a good miner?",
  "46726": "Biscarrat is a prisoner?",
  "46727": "She is very amiable, then, is she not?",
  "46728": "Do we not wish for an outlet for our surplus population, if I may so express myself?",
  "46729": "Why should she spare others?",
  "46730": "What may that mean now?",
  "46731": "If she looked favorably upon another, do you mean, monsieur?",
  "46732": "How is this strange silence to be accounted for?",
  "46733": "But, putting that aside altogether, what would they live on?",
  "46734": "But how and where?",
  "46735": "Come, will you take me as I am?",
  "46736": "And wherefore?",
  "46737": "What is the matter with me?",
  "46738": "But, pray, when you have been pumped dry one day, what have you got the next?",
  "46739": "Thus, for instance, don't you in the first place want a horse?",
  "46740": "Just a thimbleful of this?",
  "46741": "You'd like to see the room, young man?",
  "46742": "Who knows where the winds will carry this case, and in whose hands it will fall?",
  "46743": "Have we not authorized you to give yourself entirely up to this love?",
  "46744": "What do you say you won't have?",
  "46745": "The vault under the altar?",
  "46746": "Did he voluntarily ignite his own funeral pyre?",
  "46747": "Well, when can you?",
  "46748": "Is it his own, do you think?",
  "46749": "Is it dread of the unknown?",
  "46750": "She has a carriage, then, this niece of the doctor?",
  "46751": "What would you do then?",
  "46752": "And do you think you will marry?",
  "46753": "And are they going farther westward?",
  "46754": "But what says the scout?",
  "46755": "Onny children?",
  "46756": "Was it warm out there, sonny?",
  "46757": "Not do it?",
  "46758": "Will you employ that sword to spill my blood?",
  "46759": "But supposing you did?",
  "46760": "Where did it lead to?",
  "46761": "Where are the street cars and the motors?",
  "46762": "Quarrelled?",
  "46763": "Would you care to take it?",
  "46764": "For one thing, what do we know of you?",
  "46765": "How much did it cost?",
  "46766": "Have you ever had any experience upon the stage?",
  "46767": "On the jury, are you?",
  "46768": "Your excellency knows him?",
  "46769": "We know that the first has been here, but where are the signs of the other?",
  "46770": "How many chloral tabloids did you take?",
  "46771": "And what injury would they do to others?",
  "46772": "Why does it stop there?",
  "46773": "Are you getting about again yet, old fellow?",
  "46774": "Have you any means of transport?",
  "46775": "Why should you put things so bitterly, dearie?",
  "46776": "The millionaire's mite, eh?",
  "46777": "Will you direct me to a lawyer who will aid me?",
  "46778": "Are they real?",
  "46779": "And for what purpose?",
  "46780": "Do you suppose the boat will sail promptly?",
  "46781": "What was its standard?",
  "46782": "Do you remember how silent I was on the drive back?",
  "46783": "Besides, why were they not allowed to escape?",
  "46784": "Were we really there half an hour?",
  "46785": "Does that satisfy you?",
  "46786": "Won't you have something warm to drink?",
  "46787": "Do you see that, my dear?",
  "46788": "The circumstances?",
  "46789": "Would you imagine it?",
  "46790": "O, is't the custom?",
  "46791": "How many had I?",
  "46792": "What does he want me to do, I wonder?",
  "46793": "What, outside our line?",
  "46794": "Is this the way I must return to native dust?",
  "46795": "You think he has run away, do you, sir?",
  "46796": "That he should appear only at that point?",
  "46797": "What are you saying?",
  "46798": "Foolish indeed?",
  "46799": "Quite strong and well, I hope?",
  "46800": "Is his power of speech gone?",
  "46801": "Would he not have done better to have kept the water that he had decomposed in pure loss, in order to sustain him in the air?",
  "46802": "And he might have asked also, where the industry so necessary for such a trade?",
  "46803": "But if I justify it?",
  "46804": "Was he so awfully hot?",
  "46805": "Isn't that your tobacco lying there?",
  "46806": "What is thy name, fellow?",
  "46807": "Where she would be settled?",
  "46808": "Has madame come in yet?",
  "46809": "And which I can have?",
  "46810": "For who would understand the work within him?",
  "46811": "The spider?",
  "46812": "Haven't I told you I won't give them up?",
  "46813": "Where can we be going in such a tiny pool of water?",
  "46814": "Had you heard that?",
  "46815": "But what then, made her so unhappy?",
  "46816": "No brother at all?",
  "46817": "The question I have to ask myself is, shall I marry him?",
  "46818": "Have you been dragging the river all day, gentlemen?",
  "46819": "Perhaps two o'clock will suit you better?",
  "46820": "Anyone in the room could get out?",
  "46821": "A dream?",
  "46822": "And his eminence, the cardinal?",
  "46823": "Did you answer it yourself?",
  "46824": "Put 'em ashore like maroons?",
  "46825": "And what does she come worming herself in here for?",
  "46826": "What comes next?",
  "46827": "This prisoner, who was he?",
  "46828": "Do you recollect me?",
  "46829": "The lieutenant of musketeers?",
  "46830": "And you don't think the patient would object to him?",
  "46831": "You wish to be, according to your tastes or private friendships, free to destroy my plans and save my enemies?",
  "46832": "If I be right in this, how could we make any entirely new improvement by means of tonnage duties?",
  "46833": "Wherein differ the sea and the land, that a miracle upon one is not a miracle upon the other?",
  "46834": "Will you leave that spinning wheel be, you young devils?",
  "46835": "You're wretched, he's wretched, and what good can come of it?",
  "46836": "You have received a regular letter of advice?",
  "46837": "What was that awful noise?",
  "46838": "I asked him where he meant to go?",
  "46839": "And light of foot?",
  "46840": "Do you feel unwell?",
  "46841": "What is a fontis?",
  "46842": "And will not their wives be the best women?",
  "46843": "How, then, did you deduce the telegram?",
  "46844": "Which of them, seeing us together here, will believe that our meeting and dancing at the gipsy party was by chance?",
  "46845": "Why should not my father see him?",
  "46846": "I have heard a party was to leave the encampment this morning for the lake shore?",
  "46847": "What do you call important?",
  "46848": "And, really, what is the result of all this?",
  "46849": "Beg him to come at once, do you hear?",
  "46850": "What do you do in your cottage when it rains like this?",
  "46851": "If so, what we are afraid of, when we but suspect our enemies will inflict it on us, shall we inflict it on ourselves for certain?",
  "46852": "But where are you going really?",
  "46853": "Did not the sun shine upon him with a halo, so that he was bright as an angel?",
  "46854": "No dinner?",
  "46855": "How much does the proprietor increase the utility of his tenant's products?",
  "46856": "You've never worked at anything like this before, have you?",
  "46857": "Did you see us?",
  "46858": "But who could ever repay half the debt we owe you?",
  "46859": "Could he have thrown down the statue after he'd stripped the corpse?",
  "46860": "Shall we say in one hour's time?",
  "46861": "First of all, what did you see?",
  "46862": "Why, where ever did you go?",
  "46863": "You mean the rascals?",
  "46864": "Is it really calling us?",
  "46865": "Do they not think, they will have their own ends, and be truer to themselves, than to them?",
  "46866": "What humour's this?",
  "46867": "How about when you lose?",
  "46868": "But how about the new orbit in which we are moving?",
  "46869": "Shall I lead the way?",
  "46870": "Where was the poor devil to go?",
  "46871": "Would they not willingly sacrifice a little gift in order to obtain everlasting life?",
  "46872": "Where else could he have put it?",
  "46873": "Won't, if he has the chance, turn on me?",
  "46874": "Why are you explaining?",
  "46875": "Why how do you know?",
  "46876": "Well, did he?",
  "46877": "What the deuce have you done with yourself this last month?",
  "46878": "How much have you left of your hundred pistoles, d'Artagnan?",
  "46879": "Why should we load ourselves with a useless burden?",
  "46880": "Had he, beneath the childish face, already recognized the passionate, proud woman?",
  "46881": "What is the reward?",
  "46882": "Why, why, why, are there no harbours of refuge for grown men who have not yet lost them?",
  "46883": "To what good?",
  "46884": "Do you know why I came clear out here afoot?",
  "46885": "Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?",
  "46886": "Is he dead?",
  "46887": "Look here, captain, to speak candidly, do you mean to say that there is anything marvelous in the occurrence?",
  "46888": "What was his purpose?",
  "46889": "There were brave men among them, but of what use was courage when their weapons were powerless against the monster?",
  "46890": "Have you any witness on't?",
  "46891": "Is it a bargain?",
  "46892": "And in the common way of his business does he not expect to be paid for his pictures?",
  "46893": "Who is this youth?",
  "46894": "Not named?",
  "46895": "He hain't been a sittin' so all day, has he?",
  "46896": "And where is your young master?",
  "46897": "How can we truly open the doors, and set free the full genius of our people?",
  "46898": "This what?",
  "46899": "We will go up now, shall we?",
  "46900": "But, it will be asked again, can we on these grounds, admit the existence of a wise and omnipotent author of the world?",
  "46901": "You have taken them away?",
  "46902": "He wondered if she would pity him if she knew?",
  "46903": "Save it?",
  "46904": "To do with you, my lord?",
  "46905": "Our course is barred southward?",
  "46906": "What boots it to deplore?",
  "46907": "How do you manage yours?",
  "46908": "What other dreadful things may happen, who can tell?",
  "46909": "How now, what noise is that?",
  "46910": "What is that house, then?",
  "46911": "Did he cut you out?",
  "46912": "You want to know the crime of which you are accused?",
  "46913": "How could we both be deceived?",
  "46914": "How was her girl to have guarded herself from a love so unfortunate, or have avoided the rock on which her vessel had been shipwrecked?",
  "46915": "Do you notice anything about the arrangement of the lamps?",
  "46916": "Can it establish a maximum?",
  "46917": "You take a roundabout way, then, to inform me that I am very ill?",
  "46918": "Shall I myself really have to say it to him?",
  "46919": "What other case?",
  "46920": "Is there any news of game afoot?",
  "46921": "What does it matter to you?",
  "46922": "Surprised you, didn't I?",
  "46923": "Nice animal for a pleasure party, wasn't it?",
  "46924": "How much is so applied?",
  "46925": "Why do I find it so hard to breathe?",
  "46926": "Ye must tell us more, whether our dear friends at home be of good cheer?",
  "46927": "Did you find poison, or a dagger, that you look so mournful now?",
  "46928": "What do you think of that plan?",
  "46929": "Do you not feel that?",
  "46930": "Besides, are they worse than others, these whom you call savages?",
  "46931": "You believe, then, the attack will be renewed?",
  "46932": "But why should you?",
  "46933": "What was this grand, eternal pageant to which he had yearned from his childhood up, and in which he could never take part?",
  "46934": "Will nothing alter your decision?",
  "46935": "Were you hit?",
  "46936": "Can you tell me anything about the matter?",
  "46937": "Where did you meet him?",
  "46938": "By what constraint doth the high stoop to the low?",
  "46939": "What was it that opened it?",
  "46940": "And what have we to oppose to them?",
  "46941": "I suppose you work till late?",
  "46942": "Murdered?",
  "46943": "Can ye restore to us the beloved dead?",
  "46944": "Shall my silly heart be pined 'Cause I see a woman kind?",
  "46945": "Suppose he never commits the crime?",
  "46946": "So you knew me all the time, from the first moment I came into the room?",
  "46947": "From what, they asked, could his dissatisfaction arise?",
  "46948": "Is this arrangement satisfactory?",
  "46949": "Are you well?",
  "46950": "Couldn't you and I camp out in this house for the night?",
  "46951": "Where are you speaking from?",
  "46952": "What need to say that?",
  "46953": "What eye could penetrate into the tower of darkness?",
  "46954": "Has the ministry resigned?",

  "46957": "But suppose they come unarmed?",
  "46958": "But what was she doing?",
  "46959": "Was it from the cold?",
  "46960": "You will not, eh?",
  "46961": "Where should we be going, but home?",
  "46962": "Going home?",
  "46963": "But even apart from that?",
  "46964": "He won't, won't he?",
  "46965": "How is it, then?",
  "46966": "It would be terrible if we all yielded to it, wouldn't it?",
  "46967": "Of what consequence was this to them?",
  "46968": "What do they matter to you?",
  "46969": "And the work?",
  "46970": "How can you act this way, dearest?",
  "46971": "What other matters?",
  "46972": "Do you hear?",
  "46973": "How is it that a fatal organization, the organization of humanity, is adventitious, contradictory, full of tumult and catastrophes?",
  "46974": "Shall we not know it?",
  "46975": "What, indeed?",
  "46976": "Guilty?",

  "47011": "You don't mind admitting that, I suppose?",
  "47012": "Who can tell them where their father is?",
  "47013": "For how is it probable that he would have been tender of his life, when he was so bitter against his memory?",
  "47014": "And why didn't mamma speak to me about him?",
  "47015": "Is it to be some panel of philosophers, some fancied posterity, or some other outside authority?",

  "47041": "Could it ever be?",
  "47042": "Would he be so lost to propriety as to marry her before the year was out?",
  "47043": "Do they think we're dogs?",

  "47056": "In search of what?",
  "47057": "I have no doubt of it, but are these your only reasons for this sudden fancy?",
  "47058": "Do you recognize me at all?",
  "47059": "Expected?",
  "47060": "And in the meanwhile?",
  "47061": "Why did you shake your head?",
  "47062": "Wouldn't you like to go to such a beautiful city as that when you die?",
  "47063": "And what good can you do her?",
  "47064": "Who is there?",
  "47065": "And to what part of it?",
  "47066": "She said she was not your wife?",

  "47070": "How dared you?",
  "47071": "Why did she not let me know sooner?",
  "47072": "Because of the numerous court decisions of that character?",
  "47073": "You are a hypocrite, too, are you?",
  "47074": "Then why should this be so?",

  "47078": "Who comes here?",
  "47079": "And your police?",
  "47080": "Isn't it fun?",
  "47081": "What signified that disguise?",
  "47082": "But the grave question was, ought she to do this?",
  "47083": "What are you up to?",
  "47084": "What word, then, can be found to describe the days which they occupy in descending?",

  "47091": "And how will you do that?",
  "47092": "Why should it?",
  "47093": "But what then?",
  "47094": "What envy would hinder him?",
  "47095": "Danglars?",
  "47096": "Your husband isn't in the house, I suppose?",

  "47098": "Whither should I ride but to the court?",
  "47099": "And the flies?",
  "47100": "From ME?",

  "47103": "Who'll get there first?",
  "47104": "Was cupidity, strengthened by habit, to be laid asleep by a few fine sentences about virtue and union?",
  "47105": "But you will be careful, won't you?",
  "47106": "Nothing, aunt?",
  "47107": "Isn't it lucky we found it?",
  "47108": "Then why harm anyone?",
  "47109": "The good of mankind?",

  "47112": "But the work?",
  "47113": "But those who see the absolute and eternal and immutable may be said to know, and not to have opinion only?",
  "47114": "Does the reasoning strike yo as being faulty?",
  "47115": "Or perhaps you may be intending to undertake some sort of employment?",

  "47117": "Were they asked?",
  "47118": "Francois?",
  "47119": "Then you've come from my house, have you?",
  "47120": "Who is that secret lover, I ask, of whom, at least, most of the relatives know nothing?",
  "47121": "Where is the gentleman to whom you are engaged?",
  "47122": "Didn't I tell you that?",

  "47138": "What's that cry?",
  "47139": "But what I want to know, mister, is how the coppers know these things?",
  "47140": "But if, uneasy at our absence, he would venture to come?",
  "47141": "Did you tell him that it was the last door at the end of the corridor, on the right?",
  "47142": "How could I come till I knew what had befallen you?",
  "47143": "What place is that, the falcon?",

  "47152": "So, old acquaintance, said my master, again have I met you in this place?",
  "47153": "How can I explain myself?",
  "47154": "Have we lost faith?",
  "47155": "Don't you think it may be a little premature?",
  "47156": "Why did I do it?",
  "47157": "But why do you think we shall be safe?",

  "47393": "Is not such the doom of all speculative men of talent?",
  "47394": "But what does it mean?",
  "47395": "Why, what has he in him of such virtue to be regarded, ha?",
  "47396": "Get on, will you?",
  "47397": "Yea, forsooth?",
  "47398": "And, considering the question of human happiness, where, oh where does it reside?",
  "47399": "Aramis?",
  "47400": "Didn't it strike 'ee that 'twas so?",
  "47401": "But why do you not rise and greet your guest?",
  "47402": "Why did you not give up that lewd habit, that impure habit?",
  "47403": "So that's it, is it?",
  "47404": "Where do you fish, my friends?",
  "47405": "Is he the same toward the other mummies in the house?",
  "47406": "Who's the next?",
  "47407": "But are you seriously wounded?",
  "47408": "Why didn't you say I was dead?",
  "47409": "Are not all laborious things to be endured for the sake of eternal life?",
  "47410": "But can it last?",
  "47411": "And why not exclude from the suffrage all habitual drunkards judicially so declared?",
  "47412": "Why should she fight against every admission until it was forced from her?",
  "47413": "But, gentlemen, an't I to come in for a share of the profits?",
  "47414": "Well, who knows?",
  "47415": "You will write to me, won't you?",
  "47416": "Are ye lighting a fire, or are ye taking to cooking?",
  "47417": "And what the spirit that leads us wants TO BE CALLED?",

  "47437": "You have had your eye on the business, my young friend, have you?",
  "47438": "Does the body correspond so immediately with the spirit?",
  "47439": "And what are you going to buy for it?",
  "47440": "And therefore, previously?",
  "47441": "And long ago?",
  "47442": "How much?",
  "47443": "A name?",

  "47461": "Do you agree to it?",
  "47462": "It was the cardinal, then, who informed you of this fete?",
  "47463": "Can you really remember it all?",
  "47464": "Angina?",
  "47465": "Then he said, she came from the country, he saw?",
  "47466": "And see the blue heron by the lotus flowers?",
  "47467": "Oh, you are, are you?",
  "47468": "Was it soil?",

  "47472": "You will not be my comforter, my rescuer?",
  "47473": "And who were the others?",
  "47474": "You didn't definitely ask her for it, I suppose?",
  "47475": "Why shouldn't it?",
  "47476": "Can it be that they won't forgive me, won't understand how it all couldn't be helped?",
  "47477": "Do you understand?",
  "47478": "How much does he spend yearly?",
  "47479": "O, was it no otherwise?",
  "47480": "How could I doubt such a thing?",
  "47481": "How many children have you got, ma'am?",

  "47484": "You'll like that?",
  "47485": "And is her name a secret?",
  "47486": "Uneasy?",
  "47487": "But how came you upon the roof, man?",
  "47488": "La sakes, now, does it?",
  "47489": "Or did he think a chief possessing such blood in his veins could engage in such a foreign pursuit?",
  "47490": "Hear you?",
  "47491": "Will they never cease to expect corn from tares, and figs from thistles?",
  "47492": "Why SHOULD you hold out forever?",
  "47493": "Then what was it?",
  "47494": "Else, why should it be let so cheaply?",
  "47495": "Is it possible that there can be many such people on earth?",
  "47496": "And might a man be thirsty, and yet unwilling to drink?",
  "47497": "What is the secret, then?",
  "47498": "But was it on her own account, or on account of another, that she exposed herself to such hazards?",
  "47499": "Shall I tell YOU?",
  "47500": "Isn't that a pathetic strain?",
  "47501": "Ain't that a funny name?",
  "47502": "But in what trade can one earn a hundred sous a day?",
  "47503": "Whuzzamatter wiz you, hey?",

  "47507": "But you don't surely mean to walk all the way back?",
  "47508": "Do you accept the wager?",
  "47509": "Now, who the deuce do I know?",
  "47510": "Very well, sir, what next?",
  "47511": "Can it be possible to see anything equal to what we have seen?",

  "47514": "Why such a large land army?",
  "47515": "What is it my father does not know?",
  "47516": "Don't you think we pay too much rent here?",
  "47517": "Is their spiritual condition, I often wonder, much higher than their physical one?",
  "47518": "Heard what?",
  "47519": "Shall I describe his life to you?",
  "47520": "Would they stop short at the hairy cuticle, or would they attack the brain?",

  "47527": "Where were you thinking of going?",
  "47528": "Do you hear the guns, pray?",
  "47529": "Should we not rather say JURISIGNORANCE?",
  "47530": "But what about a thing like this?",
  "47531": "Was not that better than taking him prisoner?",
  "47532": "What was the name that he mentioned?",
  "47533": "Are you ready to be tested?",
  "47534": "How could I have exposed myself in their presence?",
  "47535": "Shall I see if we can manage that?",
  "47536": "Marguerite, CHERIE, what is it?",
  "47537": "Done?",
  "47538": "My dear archdeacon, who ever expected to see you?",
  "47539": "Why, have you not got any water?",
  "47540": "I think she must have guessed, in a way, don't you, what I was going to say?",
  "47541": "How could he hope to escape them?",
  "47542": "What is man's responsibility to society, the conception of which results from the conception of freedom?",
  "47543": "Now, how little do I look like being carried away trembling?",
  "47544": "To men who had risked their lives for him, and besides had done him a great service?",
  "47545": "What's the matter now?",
  "47546": "Is it to be so?",
  "47547": "This morning was it?",
  "47548": "And you don't think it's an answer, eh?",
  "47549": "What other thing do you think I could dream of doing?",
  "47550": "Which house is it?",
  "47551": "By whom?",
  "47552": "But has the problem been well put?",
  "47553": "Could any thing in womanhood be so vile?",
  "47554": "There were two parts in our former scheme of education, were there not?",

  "47556": "Who is the fellow?",
  "47557": "Pleased to be thus undeceived, I laughed at his consternation, and asked what brought him thither?",
  "47558": "Was he losing his reason and thinking he heard things which were not for human ears?",
  "47559": "How far may the idler take advantage of the laborer?",
  "47560": "Why are you going?",
  "47561": "Perhaps you could stop stuffing your nostrils with that dirty snuff?",
  "47562": "What became of the whales in that time?",
  "47563": "Who could attempt to pursue him?",
  "47564": "Genius banished?",
  "47565": "How dare I?",
  "47566": "Will you let me be killed?",
  "47567": "Well, prince, whom are we to suspect, then?",
  "47568": "I think you had some good reason for giving up the habit of going there?",
  "47569": "What day of the month is it?",
  "47570": "Is he mad, then, that mysterious old fellow?",
  "47571": "But what sort of a sailor are you?",
  "47572": "Of course you, in your position, must think a girl a castaway who isn't going to be married?",
  "47573": "Who can resist them?",
  "47574": "You think the count will be angry with me?",
  "47575": "But where?",

  "47585": "Am I wanted?",
  "47586": "How came you to be here?",
  "47587": "Can they have gone out?",
  "47588": "Is it of being poor, forsaken, wretched, that you accuse me?",
  "47589": "Did it change her much?",
  "47590": "What was jour offence?",
  "47591": "Aren't you cold?",
  "47592": "Who forbade you?",
  "47593": "What is your name, my gentle angel?",

  "47606": "What am I to say to the creature?",
  "47607": "How would you like to be treated so?",
  "47608": "Is there any one closer to me nor you, or is it likely I'd be listening to stories brought against you?",
  "47609": "And can you not see, sir, the truth that's in me?",
  "47610": "Well, young fellow, are you glad to come to school?",
  "47611": "As how, good signior?",
  "47612": "Has not that been admitted?",
  "47613": "At a registrar's?",
  "47614": "Have you read this bulletin?",
  "47615": "He of whom I have such just apprehensions?",
  "47616": "Did a woman arrive at this place night before last?",
  "47617": "Does anything occur to yourself?",
  "47618": "Then what are they?",
  "47619": "Your father, eh?",
  "47620": "Isn't that what you did?",
  "47621": "Have they not obeyed me?",
  "47622": "Isn't that a stratagem?",
  "47623": "What have you got, broth, is it?",
  "47624": "Where are my amusements?",
  "47625": "What has a father to do with it?",
  "47626": "Do I take you with me?",
  "47627": "Do you understand the theory of that affair?",
  "47628": "But you swear you won't say a word?",
  "47629": "Do you hear the way she'll be rating at your own self when a week is by?",
  "47630": "But, still, what sort of danger?",
  "47631": "No more than this?",
  "47632": "Where were the keys?",
  "47633": "Nobody know what this fudge can be?",
  "47634": "Come, what is it?",
  "47635": "Is loyalty too weak?",
  "47636": "What result, then, has ensued?",
  "47637": "Would not it be said by my presumptive remorse that, by my gallantry, manner and dress, I was going to seduce her?",
  "47638": "Never before?",
  "47639": "What do you mean, please, by my having 'done' with you?",
  "47640": "To who, sir?",
  "47641": "Did they try it on you?",
  "47642": "Are you thirsty?",
  "47643": "Will monseigneur give me the order?",
  "47644": "Where is the gardener's son now?",
  "47645": "Would it not be well that he should put an end to himself, and thus escape?",
  "47646": "Isn't it jolly to hear her?",
  "47647": "Is it not generous of him?",
  "47648": "What is the matter with you?",
  "47649": "You hear them when the window is open?",
  "47650": "You can?",
  "47651": "Now, what is the good of driblets?",
  "47652": "I'm not come too soon, am I?",
  "47653": "In fact, this bullet must have issued from a firearm, and who but a human being could have used such a weapon?",
  "47654": "Then you sat there like that, just you and she, all by yourselves?",
  "47655": "Why have I not seen you?",
  "47656": "Do you guess the reason?",
  "47657": "Is the one right any better than the other?",
  "47658": "Am I cut off from the last fond pride of meanest shipwrecked captains?",
  "47659": "Can'st not read it?",
  "47660": "Isn't it so?",
  "47661": "What is it, uncle?",
  "47662": "Is it my doing?",
  "47663": "To which dialect was he indebted?",
  "47664": "Can you play on the piano?",
  "47665": "You have no money coming in on which you can rely?",
  "47666": "From such a kind family?",
  "47667": "Why did you leave us?",
  "47668": "Who was there among all whom she knew to whom she could appeal for sympathy?",
  "47669": "Well, and you?",
  "47670": "Do I not know that, all the country round, men and woman are calling me the same behind my back?",
  "47671": "Who are these people on the side of the bill?",
  "47672": "But what is it, then?",
  "47673": "But who, then was this man?",
  "47674": "Then they do not know it yet?",
  "47675": "What if he turned his back, now, and disappeared mysteriously?",
  "47676": "You won't hold that noise, won't you?",
  "47677": "Be so kind as to walk home with him, will you?",
  "47678": "Richard?",
  "47679": "What is a prison?",
  "47680": "Are you sure?",
  "47681": "Oh, will you be quiet, and help me to carry her?",
  "47682": "Have you not read your bulletin?",
  "47683": "Shall domestic manufactures be encouraged, and in what degree, by restrictions on foreign manufactures?",
  "47684": "Or shall we say they may be continued as long as the danger which occasioned their being raised continues?",
  "47685": "Can you tell me any ill he has done?",
  "47686": "What is government?",
  "47687": "How could I forget?",
  "47688": "Hoo wor it?",
  "47689": "But why should they suppose that I despise generals?",
  "47690": "So both the brothers escaped the common fate?",
  "47691": "Where are we to live?",
  "47692": "Well, they didn't run t' day, did they, hey?",
  "47693": "What reason do they give?",
  "47694": "Do you suppose I want to shoot myself?",
  "47695": "Is it not good?",
  "47696": "Was that a trick to make me say which one I prefer?",
  "47697": "And get enchanted again?",
  "47698": "Why not, if what you assert is untrue?",
  "47699": "What's the odds where it comes from?",
  "47700": "Could she go back to the former quiet pleasures of those faraway days before the concert?",
  "47701": "Well, will you go if I change my clothes?",
  "47702": "Oh, he mentioned his name, did he?",
  "47703": "Can you let me sit by the fire?",
  "47704": "Then how?",
  "47705": "How is it possible to hear her?",
  "47706": "How are we going to get back?",
  "47707": "Need you say it face to face?",
  "47708": "Wooster?",
  "47709": "Will he get used to it?",
  "47710": "Look, will this insolence amend thy lot?",
  "47711": "Who may the four be?",
  "47712": "Do I look as if I liked it?",
  "47713": "Well, is it good?",
  "47714": "Then a man may feel for years that he is good solid company, and be wrong about himself after all?",
  "47715": "Did I say you wasn't beautiful?",
  "47716": "Are we only half way up?",
  "47717": "Pray, when, sir, shall I see you at my house?",
  "47718": "But when is this ball to take place?",
  "47719": "Doesn't it look nice, and grand, and patriarchal?",
  "47720": "And my son?",
  "47721": "But will you gi'e me all the ground the goose flew over?",
  "47722": "Who denies you this right?",
  "47723": "What is the rule in such a case?",
  "47724": "You don't find this life very interesting, I dare say?",
  "47725": "How do you mean to live then?",
  "47726": "If you see us among scores of women, will you look upon us?",
  "47727": "Where does the remainder go?",
  "47728": "Wasn't it here a minute ago?",
  "47729": "Did any of you see him trailing us?",
  "47730": "And was he sure of what he said?",
  "47731": "I wrote to you for some grammars, if you recollect, and you sent them?",
  "47732": "But shall we go down and watch this absorbing match?",
  "47733": "My plans?",
  "47734": "And who had deserved the worst?",
  "47735": "Do you believe in my instinctive feelings?",
  "47736": "And how fared the hospital under this resolve of its visitor?",
  "47737": "Are you sure I can get all the things I want there?",
  "47738": "On the front?",
  "47739": "Why weary, and palsy the arm at the oar, and the iron, and the lance?",
  "47740": "Her father, eh?",
  "47741": "What difference did it make?",
  "47742": "Are my purposes wont to be so shallow?",
  "47743": "Have you had any tea, by the by?",
  "47744": "What promise?",
  "47745": "Why a hundred men?",
  "47746": "Who finds them?",
  "47747": "Digby, whence this fire?",
  "47748": "What are you doing there, my friend?",
  "47749": "Did you treat anybody, sir?",
  "47750": "May I?",
  "47751": "Why can't you help it now?",
  "47752": "And why was I running after her?",
  "47753": "Shall history be blind to such fatality as this?",
  "47754": "Must I ever be on the way?",
  "47755": "But could you BEAR to have it swinging to your boat?",
  "47756": "Won't you hurry yourself?",
  "47757": "Why, what's the reason, sir?",
  "47758": "What might I not get to know, nearly concerning you?",
  "47759": "What do they mean?",
  "47760": "What do they want?",
  "47761": "Don't what?",
  "47762": "What is it like?",
  "47763": "And do you care?",
  "47764": "Count on my assistance?",
  "47765": "Where are they to be found?",
  "47766": "Must I always be the same?",
  "47767": "Why, pray, did you laugh at this?",
  "47768": "You can't run a church that way, can you?",
  "47769": "And were you warm?",
  "47770": "Whence comes that money?",
  "47771": "Where are we?",
  "47772": "If I told her all my fortune is lost?",
  "47773": "Who is a foolish man?",

  "47778": "So you and the cardinal have been talking about me?",
  "47779": "Have we not botanical gardens?",
  "47780": "Why will you increase my distress by this groundless dispute?",
  "47781": "Is that called a funnel?",
  "47782": "Do they look like that sort of thing?",
  "47783": "How shall I ever repay you?",
  "47784": "Are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and reconciliation?",
  "47785": "Fwhat's she doin' outside?",
  "47786": "And what do you know about the state you talk of?",
  "47787": "And why should I hesitate to betray that monster, sir?",
  "47788": "Nay, what is there that is not open to your very enemies?",
  "47789": "What is she to us?",
  "47790": "What are you?",
  "47791": "Am I to pay the piper?",
  "47792": "Who's up stairs, you dog?",
  "47793": "Who is this beauty and where is she to be seen, when she was not seen before till you saw her, if you did see her?",
  "47794": "Is it to do us some ill turn?",
  "47795": "What is it they're going to play?",
  "47796": "You wretch, eat up your visitors in your own house?",
  "47797": "Well, but that was only when I was a bit on, don't you know?",
  "47798": "Who's she?",
  "47799": "Where and when have you seen me trifle with a friend's heart and a king's life?",
  "47800": "Even when no one can hear us, may I, by no syllable, by none, not the slightest intimation, remind you of our love?",
  "47801": "Yes, it is a child, but who brought it here?",
  "47802": "Has he solved the antinomy of the division of labor, perpetual cause of the workingman's ignorance, immorality, and poverty?",
  "47803": "Eh?",
  "47804": "Have you made anything out of the tangle?",
  "47805": "And you wouldn't leave them any?",
  "47806": "What are you making such a fuss about?",
  "47807": "Well, then, whom does it concern?",
  "47808": "Do you not deduce something from that?",
  "47809": "But who could have taken it?",
  "47810": "One figure whose movements you follow with at least curiosity?",
  "47811": "One?",
  "47812": "What's to become of him?",
  "47813": "May I read it over again?",
  "47814": "How shall I ever mourn enough for all my kinsmen?",
  "47815": "Shall a man not come back to the loveliest lady in all the wide world?",
  "47816": "How long will you be with us?",

  "47819": "Can you show me the place as I go back?",
  "47820": "What else could I do?",
  "47821": "And do you think we have nothing to fear if we land?",
  "47822": "And are you going to make a fisherman of him?",
  "47823": "Have they murdered him?",
  "47824": "What kind of spectacle would its hidden hemisphere present to our terrestrial spheroid?",
  "47825": "Would you have doomed me, at any time, to the frost and blight that have hardened and spoiled me?",
  "47826": "Was this not the river in which he had intended to drown himself, in past times, a hundred years ago, or had he dreamed this?",
  "47827": "Couldn't this have been an accident?",
  "47828": "They don't look bad, do they?",
  "47829": "A secret ambassador?",
  "47830": "Do you not constantly argue that this is not the right place to oppose it?",
  "47831": "Then you have some secret hope to buoy you up and please you with whispers of the future?",
  "47832": "But where are you hurrying now?",
  "47833": "Do you mean to pretend that you didn't know it would be injurious to her to meet you here week after week?",
  "47834": "Isn't that music gay?",
  "47835": "You have the same eye to your own interest, that you always had, I doubt not?",
  "47836": "And how should you understand him?",
  "47837": "A coward?",
  "47838": "What have you done about it?",
  "47839": "What could he get by that?",
  "47840": "Do you know whom she reminds me of?",
  "47841": "The accusation?",
  "47842": "Now I ask, what idea do we form of these bodies or objects, to which we suppose solidity to belong?",
  "47843": "But am I in time?",
  "47844": "Will he not utterly hate a lie?",
  "47845": "I had the best of it this time?",
  "47846": "Can you understand the happiness I get out of my absinthe?",
  "47847": "How know you that?",
  "47848": "Now?",
  "47849": "And what kind of fool?",

  "47852": "Are you crazy?",
  "47853": "Can you wash dishes right?",
  "47854": "But do they not rather demonstrate the absence of a gang?",
  "47855": "Do you think I'm a presumptuous fool?",
  "47856": "Why need I insist further?",
  "47857": "Is he a poet?",

  "47862": "Are we still under the sea?",
  "47863": "Why didn't you tell me before I came home?",
  "47864": "But tell me, how does he produce the appearance of death?",
  "47865": "Know you what such a moment holds for me?",
  "47866": "Don't you think it must be very uncomfortable to be married to a man whose first wife was perfect?",
  "47867": "Now, my ladies, you strike him not?",
  "47868": "What is the matter, D'Artagnan?",
  "47869": "Is that the idea?",
  "47870": "Will that be necessary?",
  "47871": "You're proud of them?",
  "47872": "Why should an exception be made in her favor?",
  "47873": "Gone where?",
  "47874": "What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman?",
  "47875": "Did ever any one see such a fine piece of beef so completely ruined?",
  "47876": "Yea, is it so bad as that?",
  "47877": "Who does me this?",
  "47878": "Had they registered a vow of celibacy until their lovers should return from the war?",
  "47879": "And people think it so?",
  "47880": "What have I done that you should pass on me so severe a sentence?",
  "47881": "Did the gentleman give a name?",
  "47882": "Were they then so soon to lose him whom they had snatched from an agonizing death?",
  "47883": "And what shall you do?",
  "47884": "But why so?",
  "47885": "He was disposed to interfere too much, was he?",
  "47886": "Hot and moist?",
  "47887": "Any guerrillas?",
  "47888": "Is he goodly enough?",
  "47889": "And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?",
  "47890": "He is a rebel, then?",
  "47891": "Did you ever meet with anything like that man out of this blessed country?",
  "47892": "What were we who had strayed in here?",
  "47893": "Have I not sworn to you that I loved you in return?",
  "47894": "How have you passed the time?",
  "47895": "Why shouldn't she come down?",
  "47896": "Had it struck on a submerged rock, or on an enormous wreck?",
  "47897": "But what if it all had been lost?",
  "47898": "Why had that man taken to flight on the arrival of the police, instead of entering a complaint?",
  "47899": "If it isn't, what are we here for?",
  "47900": "But the light?",
  "47901": "And what happens?",
  "47902": "Kindly?",
  "47903": "But what step would you propose to me?",
  "47904": "Why should you want to spite her?",
  "47905": "Don't you see, my boy, that these things are debits?",
  "47906": "Can men refuse to be pleased with words of gentle advice?",
  "47907": "And just actions cause justice, and unjust actions cause injustice?",
  "47908": "Shall he live?",
  "47909": "What d'ye mean by that?",
  "47910": "Do you think he can last till morning?",
  "47911": "Don't you want to destroy it at ONCE?",
  "47912": "What, if I am steeped in poverty?",
  "47913": "An advice?",
  "47914": "No one?",
  "47915": "Oh, but can't you have the kindness to take me in?",
  "47916": "Is it in this mode that the spirit of mutual support and common effort for the common good, is to be cultivated?",
  "47917": "You will not do that?",
  "47918": "And there, don't you see?",
  "47919": "Did you say?",
  "47920": "Oh, what are you doing?",

  "47923": "How many of their friends must have fallen in the struggle?",
  "47924": "Do you see this woman sitting beside me?",
  "47925": "And when you see the same evils in the tyrannical man, what do you say of him?",
  "47926": "Are, however, pleasures and pains strictly commensurable?",
  "47927": "Do you hear me?",
  "47928": "My dear fellow, are you really on such good terms with her as to venture to take me to her box?",
  "47929": "How may I aid in the adventure?",
  "47930": "Yes, who are YOU?",
  "47931": "Not serious, I hope?",
  "47932": "Is he here?",

  "47939": "How's that?",
  "47940": "How long has he been going on thus?",
  "47941": "And that human virtue is justice?",
  "47942": "Who is on duty?",
  "47943": "Did not I say so?",
  "47944": "Do fine work?",
  "47945": "But why did we teach you that?",
  "47946": "Why did they do it?",
  "47947": "Anybody been beating 'ee?",
  "47948": "A bird of the air?",
  "47949": "It would have been terrible if any cloud had come across a friendship like ours, would it not?",
  "47950": "Did not the royal diadem shine in my hair?",
  "47951": "What doom was his own father's?",
  "47952": "Who shall it be if not he who does this work well?",
  "47953": "How many bedrooms?",
  "47954": "Well, you see the hills beyond?",
  "47955": "And can it be my fault, can I have done anything wrong?",
  "47956": "And what if we came too late?",
  "47957": "You have turned full steam on?",
  "47958": "Have you heard?",
  "47959": "Have the humanistic studies not given to him, as to so many of his contemporaries, a distinctive mental bent?",
  "47960": "What interest, let me ask, have the people in the settlement of this question?",
  "47961": "And how should I, having been a hunter all my life?",
  "47962": "Why, what's the matter with you?",
  "47963": "And why, if you knew me, do you let me die?",
  "47964": "But what is to be done?",
  "47965": "You do not doubt that, I hope?",
  "47966": "Is it interesting?",
  "47967": "Eureka?",
  "47968": "What do they call it, that which maketh them proud?",
  "47969": "If you give no credit thereto, why do not you the same in these jovial new chronicles of mine?",
  "47970": "Why do you think so?",
  "47971": "What is it, dear one?",
  "47972": "Could I retract my word, and take upon myself the responsibility of compromising the future of my companions?",
  "47973": "And is it any better as it is?",
  "47974": "Answer, what?",
  "47975": "But is there no danger from the bite?",

  "48522": "Change places with him, and would you have been looked at by those blue eyes as he was, and commiserated by that agitated face as he was?",
  "48523": "Is that your conclusion, lieutenant?",
  "48524": "What qualities have you, my friend, which would make your services so valuable?",
  "48525": "And may we not say the same of all things?",
  "48526": "And then if we look at things from a still more lofty point of view, why do we speak of civil war?",
  "48527": "Is it to tell the maids to leave their master's business and cook dinner for them?",
  "48528": "D'ye think I'm ashamed of my own name?",
  "48529": "Where did her dignity come from?",
  "48530": "Do you know what the question is here?",

  "48980": "How could I be?",
  "48981": "Who's killed, then?",
  "48982": "Well, then, why ain't it natural and right for a FRENCHMAN to talk different from us?",
  "48983": "To what use cannot feet be put?",
  "48984": "Why, why should I doubt it?",
  "48985": "What shall I tell him now from you?",
  "48986": "I faint?",
  "48987": "Then you admit it's what she was?",
  "48988": "And you say that he has a great influence over his compeers?",
  "48989": "Would you advise such baseness?",
  "48990": "Much of it this year?",
  "48991": "Do you dare to ask the bishop what you have done amiss?",
  "48992": "Does it go well between you?",
  "48993": "You no doubt observed the horses standing a few minutes since at the door?",
  "48994": "Why did he not simply stop short at the number sixty, and keep his secret until his last breath?",
  "48995": "Well, where the devil are you going now?",
  "48996": "Where, in all this teaching, was one lesson to warm the heart and guide the soul?",
  "48997": "What do you mean by coming and annoying us like this?",
  "48998": "Do you mean that you are jealous of a female person?",
  "48999": "What is left for me to do after him?",
  "49000": "And where, I ask, shall we find a nobler opportunity than this, to show what we have learnt?",
  "49001": "Didn't I tell you?",
  "49002": "But what do we mean by impossible?",
  "49003": "Of course one can do a great deal of good by helping to preserve them, but does not that work interfere with your real calling?",
  "49004": "What pangs of dim remorse and doubt and shame?",
  "49005": "Have you lost any documents before?",
  "49006": "How long do you intend, sir, that this shall hold?",
  "49007": "Is it a boy or a girl?",
  "49008": "Do you care for nuts?",
  "49009": "Think you that all virtue ceased with the death of your lord?",

  "49015": "Is it you, peasant?",
  "49016": "You think we ought to break up this life, just start and let fly?",
  "49017": "The attendants also?",
  "49018": "Do you think it has been a success?",
  "49019": "You'll just let me out for the afternoon, won't you?",
  "49020": "Will you come and see me today, at any time you like to appoint?",
  "49021": "Toads?",
  "49022": "When shall we see you again?",
  "49023": "Not half a glass?",
  "49024": "Or am I?",
  "49025": "What is there in a pair of pink cheeks and blue eyes forsooth?",
  "49026": "What could have divided you?",
  "49027": "Do you know, my own boy, that not only your proud and happy wife, but ALL women who can sing, will want to sing your music?",
  "49028": "And this was from the people, the real people?",
  "49029": "By the bull that I killed, am I to stand nosing into your dog's den for my fair dues?",
  "49030": "Can I be deceived?",
  "49031": "What can you have heard?",
  "49032": "You expect I am going to give you a little fortune, eh?",
  "49033": "Are there ever any roses?",
  "49034": "You're all right, are you?",

  "49037": "How is he, really?",
  "49038": "Clerk, will you tell us, please, what is the very stiffest penalty we can impose for each of these offences?",
  "49039": "But capital, where was that to come from?",
  "49040": "Why did I never hear of this?",
  "49041": "Did you ever know a man come out to do either, in a chariot and a pair, you ridiculous old vampire?",
  "49042": "When ever did ye see so many knights come in peace, with helmets laced on, and with swords?",
  "49043": "His'n?",
  "49044": "Would he betray him?",
  "49045": "But what foundation have we for such a supposition?",
  "49046": "And this separation and release of the soul from the body is termed death?",
  "49047": "And have you brought it away with you, my dear?",
  "49048": "Or where is reverence so beautiful?",
  "49049": "Usha, how could he be anything else?",
  "49050": "Don't you think we OUGHT to write?",
  "49051": "Yet what do we find?",

  "49053": "But who first joined his army?",
  "49054": "What is it, uncle?",
  "49055": "May I be permitted to inform my wife?",
  "49056": "And how far back into the past do your recollections extend?",
  "49057": "Well, then, how would it be if I wished to take some land?",
  "49058": "Do you remember how you came here?",
  "49059": "Do you suppose WE shouldn't be the first to speak, if there was anything that ought to be taken notice of?",
  "49060": "What is to be done with the freedmen?",
  "49061": "And how can I tell the feelings in your heart?",
  "49062": "What infernal nonsense are you talking?",
  "49063": "What would he do?",
  "49064": "What do those terms mean?",
  "49065": "And what have you got, my dear?",
  "49066": "Oh, I wish he would cease tormenting me with letters for money?",
  "49067": "And is it absolutely necessary that I should go, at once?",
  "49068": "And what was my reward?",
  "49069": "HOW?",
  "49070": "What is it all about?",
  "49071": "Leave me alone, can't you?",
  "49072": "Here are no spies, are there?",
  "49073": "Why did you do this?",
  "49074": "When are you coming to the point?",

  "49078": "Could it be possible that he was taking leave of his senses?",
  "49079": "And you visit him?",
  "49080": "Then there was a knife, was there not?",
  "49081": "So the attack is definitely resolved on?",
  "49082": "Had they not all shown that they regarded with complacency the loaves and fishes of their mother church?",
  "49083": "Can I do anything for you?",
  "49084": "What of that, my dear?",
  "49085": "When do you want to start?",
  "49086": "Where am I, or what?",
  "49087": "But what avails it to point out what is the height of injustice if this is not?",
  "49088": "David's son?",
  "49089": "Does, then, anything seem more natural than egoism?",
  "49090": "Attending him?",
  "49091": "Where was he going?",
  "49092": "And, of course, you want some one who can write that?",
  "49093": "Is it possible that you, ma'am, can have been present, and failed to mark the insulting freedom that their every look bespoke?",
  "49094": "What account have we to demand of him?",
  "49095": "Not his?",
  "49096": "And so you were waiting for your people when you sat on that stile?",
  "49097": "We're across the desert, aren't we?",
  "49098": "Who have you there wife?",

  "49108": "How do you know they are not the secret emissaries of our diplomacy?",
  "49109": "Can something bad have happened to me?",
  "49110": "How could that be?",
  "49111": "But with what motive have you learned all this?",
  "49112": "Was he vexed at my bad humour this afternoon?",
  "49113": "Did it not belong to some preadamite warrior?",
  "49114": "She SEEMED, did she?",
  "49115": "Will they follow us everywhere?",
  "49116": "How comes it, how is it, how happens it?",
  "49117": "Whom DO you respect?",
  "49118": "Why do you think that I lock this door?",
  "49119": "Anne, who was that woman?",
  "49120": "Do you know what I think about you now as compared with myself?",
  "49121": "Was she going to be married or not?",
  "49122": "And could you not get three or four men to come and address it so as to stir us up?",
  "49123": "Now, I said, every art has an interest?",
  "49124": "Whence, it may be asked, had come that plaything of the tempest?",
  "49125": "Was it one of those strange appeals which cross the dreams of disquieted minds?",
  "49126": "But do you think it would be safe to go up the side of the hill?",
  "49127": "If a man can see the next step to be taken, why should he fear the next but one?",
  "49128": "Knocked your hat off?",
  "49129": "Was that a name or a nickname?",
  "49130": "Can I help you?",
  "49131": "Should I like him if he did?",
  "49132": "What third?",
  "49133": "Which side of the road is he, sir?",
  "49134": "Where, father?",

  "49136": "Who were they?",
  "49137": "Well, what has happened to them?",
  "49138": "My criticism?",
  "49139": "And what's the name of this book?",
  "49140": "Come, will you go?",
  "49141": "Will you give me your hand, my kind young friend, and lead me in?",
  "49142": "Are they not living?",
  "49143": "Payable in advance?",
  "49144": "Any rain at your place?",
  "49145": "What caused this suicidal epidemic?",
  "49146": "Will it therefore be beautiful?",
  "49147": "And the women do this?",
  "49148": "Is it because you have your crown on that you look so young?",
  "49149": "Frightened, my own?",
  "49150": "Could you not trust my eyes for this?",
  "49151": "Is he to have an entire monopoly on that subject?",
  "49152": "Ought I to put it right?",
  "49153": "But why speak about her?",
  "49154": "Do you know what thing it was that convinced me more than all the others?",

  "49164": "Are we pining in secret?",
  "49165": "Who wants what LUCK would bring?",
  "49166": "You know the song, perhaps?",
  "49167": "Last week?",
  "49168": "When I looked at this one, what do you think I saw?",

  "49180": "By demanding my head of the cardinal?",
  "49181": "A hit?",
  "49182": "I seem foolish to you, don't I?",
  "49183": "How was he openly, before the world, to show that he utterly disapproved of and abhorred such a man?",
  "49184": "By the way, how was the letter to that old blockhead signed?",
  "49185": "Is he handsome?",
  "49186": "Is he a bad lot?",
  "49187": "What mean ye, varlets, that ye push upon us so?",
  "49188": "What is it like?",
  "49189": "You, mother?",

  "49194": "A ball at this season?",
  "49195": "What rhyme do you want?",
  "49196": "Who does this?",
  "49197": "Why, what now?",
  "49198": "How can you propose it?",
  "49199": "When will you be ready to go?",
  "49200": "But why of these enquire?",
  "49201": "The price of these pearls varies according to their size?",
  "49202": "Who is HE?",
  "49203": "You don't know him?",
  "49204": "Some other prospect has opened to him, perhaps?",
  "49205": "Do many beasts live here?",
  "49206": "What, his face?",
  "49207": "How is he now, my duck of diamonds?",
  "49208": "How big?",

  "49213": "Not a ghost of a chance?",
  "49214": "It's a nice glass of wine isn't it?",
  "49215": "Salsie, won't you play something?",
  "49216": "But why speak of his coming poor?",
  "49217": "May I ask why?",
  "49218": "But if you had been drowned, what then?",
  "49219": "May not I say that he was wanting in virtue?",
  "49220": "But how had he accomplished it?",
  "49221": "Could you have swum so far?",
  "49222": "Does he know you feel yourself so in the wrong?",
  "49223": "Dear, would you like one turn in the garden?",
  "49224": "According to that, if my senses are annihilated, if my body is dead, I can have no existence of any sort?",
  "49225": "But where shall I stay?",
  "49226": "How are you, and what can I do for you?",
  "49227": "Whither go they?",
  "49228": "You recollect how, for nine days and nights, I never closed my eyes as I sat beside his bed?",
  "49229": "Does it?",
  "49230": "And how does the son come into being?",
  "49231": "Were you ever with a circus, brother?",
  "49232": "Do you observe anything noteworthy about them?",
  "49233": "And what motive could have united the labors of so many millions of men, in a place that no one inhabited?",
  "49234": "How, then, being an old man, shall I learn the subtleties of refined disquisitions?",
  "49235": "But your opinion as to his state?",
  "49236": "I wonder if mother will ask me what it means?",
  "49237": "What evidence, then, have we for the fact of the apostolical succession?",
  "49238": "Why else had she told him then, for the first time, that she did not know where to rank herself?",
  "49239": "Has he gone away?",
  "49240": "Tell me now, what do you prescribe?",
  "49241": "What should we see when we got there?",
  "49242": "But what makes the ship list so?",
  "49243": "And is he likely to be brave who has no spirit, whether horse or dog or any other animal?",
  "49244": "What other purpose could it have served?",
  "49245": "Reporters?",
  "49246": "Why don't you show 'em yourself?",
  "49247": "Well, has it been worth while?",
  "49248": "But where are you going, monsieur, where are you going?",
  "49249": "It fits very nicely, does it not?",
  "49250": "Now do you really live in the city?",
  "49251": "How was such a thing possible?",
  "49252": "Have not you also that passive obedience which is so easily converted into soldierly obedience?",
  "49253": "What is there to enjoy in that?",
  "49254": "Who did tha' ask about it?",
  "49255": "Does he keep a school?",
  "49256": "What would it be like?",
  "49257": "I appeal then to this meeting, and I put it to them whether life, such as exists upon the earth, is possible on the surface of the moon?",
  "49258": "Should he wait any longer?",
  "49259": "Where are they going, then?",
  "49260": "What was he to do with such a woman as this?",
  "49261": "What streets would you like to walk down, then?",
  "49262": "Seeing her with her father?",
  "49263": "Whereas the physician and the carpenter have different natures?",
  "49264": "Oh, what?",
  "49265": "In what shape?",
  "49266": "Where will it take me?",
  "49267": "Likeness?",
  "49268": "Why should I remember?",
  "49269": "For how can one be divided into two?",
  "49270": "What does that prove?",
  "49271": "Have I been walking around the house at all?",
  "49272": "Hard?",
  "49273": "What does that mean?",
  "49274": "Isn't it beautiful?",
  "49275": "Had they been killed in the struggle?",
  "49276": "What do you say to a little thing in the pendant line?",
  "49277": "I should just like to know the reason why?",
  "49278": "Your husband?",
  "49279": "Suppose even we caught him, what could we prove?",
  "49280": "Was it witchcraft?",
  "49281": "Where did you get that ridiculous glove of yours?",
  "49282": "What might appear when that hazy curtain was altogether withdrawn?",
  "49283": "Why didn't your friends come to meet 'ee?",
  "49284": "What is your pleasure in the matter of the interview?",
  "49285": "Why, then, is the earth appropriated?",
  "49286": "And there was nothing else?",
  "49287": "And if so, under what conditions?",
  "49288": "Why doesn't she make fun of him?",
  "49289": "Or would the creatures that lived in those wild woods come and lick his hand and flatter him?",
  "49290": "How could such a beautiful character fail to make this angel beloved by all who knew him?",
  "49291": "When did he desert?",
  "49292": "Why were you there with that little chap?",
  "49293": "Do you take our vessel for a wreck and us for porpoises?",
  "49294": "Are we not going too slowly?",
  "49295": "But why should it not be painted?",
  "49296": "Hey?",

  "49306": "A legal right, yes, but had he a moral right?",
  "49307": "You and your cloak and leggings, eh?",
  "49308": "How is one to do in order to get it justly divided?",
  "49309": "Can you steer?",
  "49310": "And you stick to the old shop?",
  "49311": "And would a late poet, in a society no longer feudal, know how to wind it up?",
  "49312": "Why didn't some one tell me?",
  "49313": "Hurst?",
  "49314": "Is any man so learned as the devils are?",
  "49315": "He only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?",
  "49316": "Can it be possible that our island is supernatural?",

  "49318": "Now, my friends, why do I say he is devoid of these possessions?",
  "49319": "Why is it so difficult, my dear?",
  "49320": "Why is this?",
  "49321": "And who told you about it?",
  "49322": "Is there some monster beneath us belonging to the extinct races, more voracious than the shark, more fearful in vastness than the whale?",
  "49323": "Well, what made you make that brutal and belching noise?",
  "49324": "You are looking for a situation, miss?",
  "49325": "I here ask what weight will be needed to counterpoise and resist the tendency of each of these arches to give way?",

  "49327": "Last year you mean, when I was fresh from that horrid vulgar school?",
  "49328": "But can you use different animals for the same purpose, unless they are bred and fed in the same way?",
  "49329": "Had you no fear of being kicked downstairs, sir?",
  "49330": "They?",
  "49331": "Does any one live, who knows what a steady memory you have, half as well as I do?",
  "49332": "Would you like to sleep with me?",
  "49333": "What say you?",
  "49334": "How came he to abandon it?",

  "50157": "Do your ears tell you that they have traced our retreat?",
  "50158": "What made you sit in such an awkward position?",
  "50159": "Why shouldn't we both be married, instead of sitting through the long winter evenings by our solitary firesides?",
  "50160": "You think me rather parsimonious, don't you?",
  "50161": "Why are you so very shy, and so very sombre?",
  "50162": "Would any one of us be here if we weren't paupers?",
  "50163": "What other initiative, what greater authority, do you ask?",
  "50164": "Why do you serve in this capacity?",
  "50165": "How do you like it?",
  "50166": "What month?",
  "50167": "More than in other years?",
  "50168": "But could he be sure that this was all that was to be said about this enigma, and that he should never arrive at a solution?",
  "50169": "Half a mile, you say?",
  "50170": "Has anything happened, ma'am?",
  "50171": "Where is the man who brought the letter?",
  "50172": "Whither am I going?",
  "50173": "Shall I have it, or shall I not?",
  "50174": "And all my limbs unbroken?",
  "50175": "Why did they?",
  "50176": "Do you know where we could get one?",
  "50177": "Well, and you want your fortune told?",
  "50178": "Because I loved and married someone else doesn't alter the fact that I once cared for him, does it?",
  "50179": "Was it his wife, or else as like her as any sister could be?",
  "50180": "Does that mean that all men have a right to all property?",
  "50181": "How could she tell where I had got the handkerchief?",
  "50182": "And can bear to have my morsel of bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my cup?",
  "50183": "One thing and another commit?",
  "50184": "Oh, isn't that too bad?",
  "50185": "What troops are these that seem to be passing through the wood?",
  "50186": "You'd never think it to look at me, would you?",
  "50187": "What shall I sing?",
  "50188": "What object could they have?",
  "50189": "And do you suppose she understands nothing?",
  "50190": "Could I have caused that girl's death and procreated this being?",
  "50191": "What do the women find so impressive in that little brat?",
  "50192": "Well, sir?",
  "50193": "And I must cross it with silver, I suppose?",
  "50194": "A letter?",
  "50195": "Whom follow?",
  "50196": "What means this profession of faith?",
  "50197": "His wife?",
  "50198": "What place is that?",
  "50199": "Is not this thing which you advise me to do a little cowardly?",
  "50200": "Who has paid adulation to the nation while claiming for it a sovereignty which it was incapable of exercising?",
  "50201": "Have you not wished to go?",
  "50202": "Died he of sickness or through treachery?",
  "50203": "Isn't this rather sudden?",
  "50204": "To how much?",
  "50205": "Why, why are people all balls of bitter dust?",
  "50206": "You tell me nothing?",
  "50207": "What means this?",
  "50208": "Who calls?",
  "50209": "Why should I deny it?",
  "50210": "What is the matter with them?",
  "50211": "Now, children, which is it to be?",
  "50212": "Is the doctrine warranted by FACTS?",
  "50213": "Then what will you do with me then?",
  "50214": "Can anyone grasp what such an offer meant at such a spot, made to a man who, to tell the truth, is very fond of a smoke after meals?",
  "50215": "From whom had they that information?",
  "50216": "Shall I ever see your sister?",
  "50217": "Then your duchess is still at the waters?",
  "50218": "Have you heard anything of the case?",
  "50219": "Do you wish to try to do so?",
  "50220": "After all, he said in his bitterness, what can a woman care about so much as house and furniture?",
  "50221": "What was his devotion worth to her?",
  "50222": "I suppose I could walk with the rest?",
  "50223": "But why waste more words on them?",
  "50224": "What was it fell last night from the evil moon?",
  "50225": "Well, then, I said, why couldn't she tell her husband to fetch a dog?",
  "50226": "Just as she was, in a manner, pretending to listen?",
  "50227": "Two words?",
  "50228": "It was he who told you to invite me to appear with these studs?",
  "50229": "And how were they treated?",
  "50230": "Do you bring me a message from the king, or have you made a bold hit, and wish me to take you again under my protection?",
  "50231": "Isn't it a terrible thing to die so young as that?",
  "50232": "How many times have we seen it?",
  "50233": "Well, then, what possessed you to go down there this time of night?",
  "50234": "And do you know who is his lieutenant?",
  "50235": "Did not you take heed, quoth he, a little before he opened his mouth to speak, what a shogging, shaking, and wagging his head did keep?",
  "50236": "I suppose that's what your humanity would suggest?",
  "50237": "And are you going away, then, really?",
  "50238": "Do you not know that you have been dead this long time?",
  "50239": "How long a delay do you wish for?",
  "50240": "Well, what will you give for it?",
  "50241": "What evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of your senses?",
  "50242": "But should you not interfere?",
  "50243": "It would trouble me sadly to make him unhappy, for I couldn't fall in love with the dear old fellow merely out of gratitude, could I?",
  "50244": "Where were thy senses?",
  "50245": "Mademoiselle, how could you believe that?",
  "50246": "Do you understand what the word pity means?",
  "50247": "You mean it makes you feel that you have nothing?",
  "50248": "But what about women?",
  "50249": "Besides, how could one land on the opposite bank among willows which would scuttle the boat, and with a flood of unknown extent?",
  "50250": "Have I, indeed, said anything you should answer with such a cruel remark?",
  "50251": "What hinders it?",
  "50252": "Would you care fer any one that took all those?",
  "50253": "You haven't breakfasted?",
  "50254": "So what have you done with it?",
  "50255": "You mean when a woman has children?",
  "50256": "What is there to surprise anyone in that?",
  "50257": "If I only had it here, wretch that I am, what more should we want?",
  "50258": "Well, monseigneur?",
  "50259": "Do you wish me to begin admiring the peoples?",
  "50260": "Do I not myself know that I am at this moment in want of a dozen pages, and that I am sick with cudgelling my brains to find them?",
  "50261": "Which do ye choose?",
  "50262": "Did you observe any one during the first act?",
  "50263": "Have you heard the news?",
  "50264": "And what IS this on my head?",
  "50265": "Why deceive us further?",
  "50266": "And by whom are you forbidden?",
  "50267": "Who has done this?",
  "50268": "And who was that man?",
  "50269": "What happened to you?",
  "50270": "What put her up to clearing out?",
  "50271": "To play blindman's bluff?",
  "50272": "Well, sire?",
  "50273": "Any answer?",
  "50274": "How do you do?",
  "50275": "You wouldn't like your relations to be starved, even if they were only third cousins, would you?",
  "50276": "And so, is it quite certain he is coming?",
  "50277": "What have you discovered?",
  "50278": "If nobody were rich, who would employ the poor?",
  "50279": "And what do you expect the king to reply?",
  "50280": "But if she does?",
  "50281": "Where is he who could say it no?",
  "50282": "I have surely not been dreaming, have I?",
  "50283": "Shall we light a fire, so as to signal our presence on the coast?",
  "50284": "Do you think of dying, my lord?",
  "50285": "What does the poetry or the value of the ring signify?",
  "50286": "What do you believe, what do you KNOW?",
  "50287": "How's my poor brother?",
  "50288": "Is he so hard, then?",
  "50289": "Why did you come?",
  "50290": "Oh, mother, what is the matter?",
  "50291": "And what house is this?",
  "50292": "What, no second club?",
  "50293": "Will fish go down with them?",
  "50294": "May it not, theoretically, include as much of the universe as is known to man?",
  "50295": "Is it my affair?",
  "50296": "I, madame?",
  "50297": "Why should you go about the parish?",
  "50298": "Who is this ancient teacher or who is his prototype if he is an ideal being?",
  "50299": "What could those words mean?",
  "50300": "Did you never do any robbery in your life?",
  "50301": "What devil?",
  "50302": "Why are we less prompt to provide for our own safety than the rest of the citizens?",
  "50303": "I said, do you hear me?",
  "50304": "For what purpose?",
  "50305": "Is his hour past?",
  "50306": "Do you know of any other?",
  "50307": "For how, under different wills, should we find complete unity of ends?",
  "50308": "Did you ever see anything to equal it, as you steam away in the sunset?",
  "50309": "Were you thinking of your birth then?",
  "50310": "Look at a plant in the midst of its range, why does it not double or quadruple its numbers?",
  "50311": "Couldn't he have waited for the good season to increase his chances?",
  "50312": "Am I too heavy?",
  "50313": "Shall we agree to this plan, or not?",
  "50314": "Buy back your wheelbarrow?",
  "50315": "Do they begin by exciting the detestation of the very instruments of their intended usurpations?",
  "50316": "Up so early?",
  "50317": "Do I know you?",
  "50318": "His things and his bag are with him?",
  "50319": "Another shock, eh?",
  "50320": "Can I trust you?",
  "50321": "Other people's?",
  "50322": "And did you see her just now, as she spoke of her father?",
  "50323": "And fought?",
  "50324": "Was there no other who contributed?",
  "50325": "Under what obligation do I lie of making such an abuse of time?",
  "50326": "Could any other man express what they knew so well how to express in tones and in words?",
  "50327": "But what book is that next it?",
  "50328": "It surely cannot be you who made shoes for me at the l'ecole militaire?",
  "50329": "How must I do?",
  "50330": "But how, sir, said I, did you part?",
  "50331": "Where was the first lion?",
  "50332": "When didn't you?",
  "50333": "What is its name?",
  "50334": "That is, you mean that sin keeps him back?",
  "50335": "To whom was this letter addressed?",
  "50336": "Carlo, did I offer any violence?",
  "50337": "Couldn't stand it, eh?",
  "50338": "Who are your uncles and aunts?",
  "50339": "What was he saying yesterday?",
  "50340": "And do you think I ever shall?",
  "50341": "Why do you want me?",
  "50342": "I ask you what year is it?",
  "50343": "What sent you hither?",
  "50344": "Was such a thing ever heard of?",
  "50345": "What had she to do with the justice or injustice of other people?",
  "50346": "Which is it to be, death or life?",
  "50347": "Jule, you won't go, will you?",
  "50348": "How will they proceed?",
  "50349": "Not a cloud?",
  "50350": "What has that boy been about?",
  "50351": "Or any other time?",
  "50352": "Are they not already in the land?",
  "50353": "What did they want there?",
  "50354": "To which?",
  "50355": "The surface of a sphere?",
  "50356": "Are they happy?",
  "50357": "Is it a good road, and how far?",
  "50358": "And the lord chamberlain?",
  "50359": "Mayor?",
  "50360": "Had you ever any reason to complain of him?",
  "50361": "Will you promise me then to be at peace?",
  "50362": "A voyage?",
  "50363": "And they found the child?",
  "50364": "Yet what will the energy of true genius not effect?",
  "50365": "What is there to hinder?",
  "50366": "Is it a lonely farm?",
  "50367": "And can I play with him, too?",
  "50368": "Why do I want to go?",
  "50369": "What business, said she, had you to read my letter?",
  "50370": "Or, if it ought to give any, what are the different parts of education which it ought to attend to in the different orders of the people?",
  "50371": "Why don't he, in such a case, sell his horses, let his house, turn off his servants, and make a thorough reform at once?",
  "50372": "You don't mean to say you have forgotten that you promised to make half a dozen calls with me today?",
  "50373": "What time did he set off for town?",
  "50374": "And are you coming with us?",
  "50375": "When had that question been settled?",
  "50376": "Had he travelled?",
  "50377": "And why have you such an air of sadness aboard?",
  "50378": "Could these girls have been injured by the perusal of novels?",
  "50379": "And what has become of the business?",
  "50380": "Was it an instant of enchantment only or long hours and years and ages?",
  "50381": "Is the lady so very alarming?",
  "50382": "Your marriage?",
  "50383": "Won't you, young fellow?",
  "50384": "Your aunt?",
  "50385": "By means of what organ?",
  "50386": "What DOES the face matter?",
  "50387": "All of it?",
  "50388": "Do you think I show symptoms of yellow fever or cholera, that you are making post mortem arrangements with such zeal?",
  "50389": "Is he lost, I wonder, in this desert?",
  "50390": "Can you enlighten me on that point?",
  "50391": "What makes her want to see ye?",
  "50392": "Do you mean to ask this girl to marry you?",
  "50393": "Are you quite well?",
  "50394": "And what this?",
  "50395": "Did not his land produce sufficient of everything?",
  "50396": "When did it break out?",
  "50397": "Why add up the elements of resistance and anarchy?",
  "50398": "And pray, if you are so good, who ventures to affirm that?",
  "50399": "What for?",
  "50400": "What are you thinking of doing?",
  "50401": "How could we live and where could we live?",
  "50402": "Is it so nice as all that?",
  "50403": "But what do I say?",
  "50404": "Or wasn't it meant for my ears?",
  "50405": "Whom does this belong to?",
  "50406": "Who are you, my good man?",
  "50407": "Do they think the prefect will be glad to dine down there under a tent like a gipsy?",
  "50408": "Had I dreamt?",
  "50409": "Why did she so lose courage?",
  "50410": "And can you not understand why I said fortune favours us?",
  "50411": "What's the use of living?",
  "50412": "Are you well and happy?",
  "50413": "What to do?",
  "50414": "Did the sun, which shone so brightly everywhere else, really fall upon him?",
  "50415": "What brings you here, dear heart?",
  "50416": "What were they now?",
  "50417": "I suppose you haven't got a brass farthing, have you?",
  "50418": "You understand what I say?",
  "50419": "Are they in safety?",
  "50420": "Sneezed, did you?",
  "50421": "I'm not?",
  "50422": "Have you forgotten that a son ought to love and honour his father and mother?",
  "50423": "Had the remembrance of her teaching utterly vanished, and the last trace of her maternal influence quite faded away?",
  "50424": "Don't you know the cawing crow lives five times as long as a man?",
  "50425": "What do you want with me?",
  "50426": "You are staying the whole evening, I hope?",
  "50427": "Why shouldn't she like him?",
  "50428": "What weight would that carry?",
  "50429": "Doesn't she look lovely?",
  "50430": "Good gracious, what noise is that?",
  "50431": "Have you seen the princess?",
  "50432": "Is it because there is no word tender enough to be your name?",
  "50433": "Won't you try and care for me a little?",
  "50434": "So you wanted to get away, my dear, did you?",
  "50435": "Did it not show that he comprehended his relations with her?",
  "50436": "What need of positive law where natural justice is, of itself, a sufficient restraint?",
  "50437": "But how was it settled between you, mamma?",
  "50438": "What means this?",
  "50439": "What is it that is strange?",
  "50440": "Coming in to have a short time?",
  "50441": "Do you reproach me?",
  "50442": "And what do you pick your teeth with, after devouring that fat goose?",
  "50443": "Had not his books taught him that he was a man?",
  "50444": "And will you mention to me the yearly sum which would repay you for managing these affairs which we have discussed together?",
  "50445": "What'll be over?",
  "50446": "But then, what are we here for?",
  "50447": "Why shouldn't I have them all to myself?",
  "50448": "You'll wait and wave your handkerchief when I get to that turn in the road?",
  "50449": "Two years ago, wasn't it?",
  "50450": "Now, what do you think the lawyer making the inquiries wants?",
  "50451": "You have?",
  "50452": "De qui?",
  "50453": "What was it, my dear?",
  "50454": "She was young, you say?",
  "50455": "His effect?",
  "50456": "What is life to you?",
  "50457": "Where are you living now?",
  "50458": "How can I tell whet ye say?",
  "50459": "Have they?",
  "50460": "Shall my messenger, in your name, tell your people to give in?",
  "50461": "And does he still tip you?",
  "50462": "If he forsakes his faith, how doth it profit you?",
  "50463": "Why do you do such a strange thing?",
  "50464": "Why did you think so?",
  "50465": "Does he say so now?",
  "50466": "And both should be in harmony?",
  "50467": "Why, you love him, do you not?",
  "50468": "I hope I am doing nothing wrong in asking it again?",
  "50469": "Had he spoken of himself, of himself as he was or wished to be?",
  "50470": "If he did not, what would she do?",
  "50471": "And ought not the same natures to have the same pursuits?",
  "50472": "What next?",
  "50473": "Won't you come to see mamma?",
  "50474": "Why did it happen?",
  "50475": "But our troop horses?",
  "50476": "Nay, tell me, how many histories are there filled with these marvels?",
  "50477": "It's likely, isn't it, then there would be two girls with a name like that?",
  "50478": "Do you mind my smoking?",
  "50479": "How, then, does this passion for gain, abandoned to itself, turn to the prejudice of society?",
  "50480": "If a kiss had been imprinted?",
  "50481": "Well, do you attend the function tonight?",
  "50482": "Whence the cause of this singular intoxication, the consequences of which might have been very disastrous?",
  "50483": "But they have wisdom, else what is the use of having died?",
  "50484": "Always a muddle?",
  "50485": "Have I given no testimony of my sincerity and of my passion?",
  "50486": "That's everything?",
  "50487": "Is this the same lemonade of which you partook?",
  "50488": "And what does he charge?",
  "50489": "But the horses?",
  "50490": "Is not a debt, while the solvency of the debtor is undoubted, always reckoned as part of the wealth of the creditor?",
  "50491": "In summer?",
  "50492": "And what the devil was the matter with his head?",
  "50493": "Why do we love?",
  "50494": "And what do the rulers call the people?",
  "50495": "And how much was the residue?",
  "50496": "What do you think he replied?",
  "50497": "Or is it equally criminal in every body?",
  "50498": "Perhaps you think I shall abandon you, dear grandpapa, and that I shall forget you when I am married?",
  "50499": "What's coming next?",
  "50500": "Did your father speak of it?",
  "50501": "What was that noise?",
  "50502": "Then why didn't you say so before, you idiot?",
  "50503": "Your father breaks horses, don't he?",
  "50504": "What made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here?",
  "50505": "An old hag who said her son had the plague?",
  "50506": "How then was it closed?",
  "50507": "What is the cause of all this?",
  "50508": "What do I seek on the height?",
  "50509": "Have the enemy called in any foreign help?",
  "50510": "Will you believe that she never said a prayer in her life till tonight?",
  "50511": "Lost her memory, eh?",
  "50512": "And pray who are the persons who exhaust your fortune?",
  "50513": "You did not recognise me?",
  "50514": "How shall I break through them?",
  "50515": "That your own bunk over on that side?",
  "50516": "Is this a fact?",
  "50517": "But where, where was this self, this innermost part, this ultimate part?",
  "50518": "What have I to consider?",
  "50519": "Had she succeeded in extracting the secret, and awakening in that adamant heart a last faint touch of pity?",
  "50520": "And will you transfer me to your brother?",
  "50521": "Indeed formerly you were wont to give us some freely, and will you not now let us have any for our money?",
  "50522": "How did it come about, I wonder, that the elder officers are not here to interfere with anything you do?",
  "50523": "Natasha, what is it about?",
  "50524": "I may turn my back on this town a few hours sooner than I intended, but what of that?",
  "50525": "How are they?",
  "50526": "Divide it by three, and what is the result?",
  "50527": "Would I speak to you if he did?",
  "50528": "Where shall I go to find you?",
  "50529": "And the casks?",
  "50530": "Said I, is there here a new world?",
  "50531": "Hamlet's which?",
  "50532": "And suppose some learned traveller should come across these specimens, eh?",
  "50533": "Dare you pretend to rouse him against me?",
  "50534": "Is it possible that you consider the sea to be greater now than formerly?",
  "50535": "Where are your reindeer?",
  "50536": "Why was it I wanted to tell him and did not tell him?",
  "50537": "Have I not a wife?",
  "50538": "What time are you supposed to return?",
  "50539": "Why, what are these doing, who are bent down so much?",
  "50540": "Five pounds?",
  "50541": "Had they restored the master's gold with the clothes?",
  "50542": "But why do you wish to bind yourself?",
  "50543": "Say, is it possible?",
  "50544": "You've bought our inn?",
  "50545": "If he were not only to sink from his highest resolve, but to sink into the hideous fettering of domestic hate?",
  "50546": "Must one not surrender his right when he is unable to recover it?",
  "50547": "Why are you so careful, so tender, of this one wrong and no other?",

  "51498": "Was she afraid of him presuming?",
  "51499": "Did the shot that we had heard proceed from an enemy, and had he killed or wounded our leader, her husband?",
  "51500": "Or do you perhaps believe the whole matter to be already closed?",
  "51501": "Astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?",

  "51560": "Do you mind my putting on my waterproof and going to see if she got in?",
  "51561": "Does the crime consist in that relation?",
  "51562": "Why not then seek in the latter, the happiness which he had vainly dreamed of finding in the former?",
  "51563": "Will you ask him if I can see him for a moment?",
  "51564": "What is it that you advise and counsel me to do?",
  "51565": "What are you doing that for?",
  "51566": "Aeneid that so, doctor?",
  "51567": "Do you speak the truth, monsieur?",
  "51568": "What words?",
  "51569": "In that case you will send me to the prison, perhaps?",
  "51570": "The bodies were not plundered, were they?",
  "51571": "And now you'll save yerself the trouble, won't ye?",
  "51572": "But why should I die?",
  "51573": "Was I making any observation?",
  "51574": "What do you intend to do?",

  "51576": "Well, how are you getting on?",
  "51577": "Child, do you love me?",
  "51578": "Where's your home?",
  "51579": "Wasn't he helping you catch the rooster?",
  "51580": "Monopolist or speculator, what matters the name, if you admit the thing?",
  "51581": "In the night?",
  "51582": "Or why would grandfather have been so angry with you?",
  "51583": "Or was it that they understood the answers science gave to these problems in some different, clearer sense than he did?",
  "51584": "Why funny, what is funny?",
  "51585": "Oh, you naughty boy, fie for shame, what do you do so far away from home?",

  "52297": "And if it were true, what then?",
  "52298": "But what about the question of doctrine, of belief?",

  "52331": "What did most of the people do?",
  "52332": "Funny, ain't it?",
  "52333": "Surely you are mistaken?",
  "52334": "By exalting himself, or endeavoring to abase me?",
  "52335": "Are we at the end?",
  "52336": "Well, who doubts it?",
  "52337": "Have you endeavoured to trace any of the securities here mentioned?",
  "52338": "When did you find it out?",
  "52339": "Who, may I ask?",
  "52340": "Now, how had this noble rescue been accomplished?",
  "52341": "Seems a fate in it, don't there?",
  "52342": "Could it be done on horseback, think you?",
  "52343": "Don't you reckon I know who hid that money in that coffin?",
  "52344": "Nelly, will you keep a secret for me?",
  "52345": "Will you take an arquebuse?",
  "52346": "Is not a journeyman barber as good as a journeyman baker?",

  "52366": "Counsels upon what, sire?",
  "52367": "Why not?",
  "52368": "Where is your proof?",
  "52369": "Is that how you would describe your religion in a census paper?",
  "52370": "What made you think of ambition?",
  "52371": "You do get so attached to things like that, don't you?",
  "52372": "Whose fault is it?",
  "52373": "But what was that mangled shape lying over there among the sandbags?",
  "52374": "And you are, then, perfectly sure of our victory?",
  "52375": "Did my father that?",
  "52376": "How could the thing be possible?",
  "52377": "What is his name?",

  "52395": "My young friend, what is bondage?",
  "52396": "On earth, has he not pray'd?",
  "52397": "Did he still believe, now that the door of this prison was closed upon him, that he would succeed?",
  "52398": "What shall we think of the motives which could induce men of sense to reason in this manner?",
  "52399": "Very much?",

  "53453": "How's a poor man to live that way?",
  "53454": "Did she place it on her head?",
  "53455": "This is clear enough, I suppose?",
  "53456": "What is that you have in your hand?",
  "53457": "Surely you don't want any consolation at such a moment?",

  "53464": "How old do you think she is?",
  "53465": "Can't you make him?",
  "53466": "But what are we to do with it?",
  "53467": "Natasha, you love me?",
  "53468": "Who recommended you to come here?",
  "53469": "Strange, is it not, that the thunder birds flap so heavily along the west at that moment and a peal of laughter sounds from the lake?",
  "53470": "Is it a secret, sir?",
  "53471": "Well, what do you want us to do?",
  "53472": "I hope you don't mean mine, my dear?",
  "53473": "Bounds, my dear?",

  "53479": "Can you tell what we may have to go through yet?",
  "53480": "How, then, am I going to stop him?",
  "53481": "It isn't true that you are a baron?",
  "53482": "How lost you your name, my most kind virgin?",
  "53483": "Who is to lead, and who to follow?",
  "53484": "Will you, his wife, and you, his mistress, publicly swear with a sacred oath to the truth of your declaration?",
  "53485": "Has that infernal dog torn up those geraniums again?",
  "53486": "And our guardian is both warrior and philosopher?",
  "53487": "Well, did you grieve very much for her?",
  "53488": "Are you kidding?",
  "53489": "And what did you do meantime?",
  "53490": "What's that on the arm of the chair, a fur cloak or some beast?",
  "53491": "Now, what can you do?",
  "53492": "You will go down slow, sir, I suppose?",
  "53493": "Whuzzat you say?",
  "53494": "Will you come again and help me to do it?",
  "53495": "What is the debt?",
  "53496": "And shall I nail down the lid, sir?",
  "53497": "Do you wish for a notary?",
  "53498": "What was it she bore in her arms, the little bundle that she held tight to her breast to shield it from the falling snow?",
  "53499": "What is the use of trying any more?",
  "53500": "Have you found them?",
  "53501": "Ca vous amuse, la vie?",

  "53511": "Why should I mind?",
  "53512": "You with a pleasant home?",
  "53513": "All alone?",
  "53514": "And have they keys of the grating?",
  "53515": "Don't you think I am?",
  "53516": "And should I always be sitting with you?",
  "53517": "If I do, will you grant me common sense, then, for the future?",
  "53518": "Why, once you are rid of them, should you pester criminals to respect an uncongenial standard of conduct?",
  "53519": "And what is it we are watching for?",
  "53520": "Cannibals?",
  "53521": "On what then are you to live?",
  "53522": "What should he have to mind?",
  "53523": "And whom are you yours from, mamma?",
  "53524": "You are wounded?",
  "53525": "Perhaps he would not see her any more?",
  "53526": "Do you complain of that?",
  "53527": "Who has told them not to capture me these twenty times over?",
  "53528": "What is the cause of this exclusion?",
  "53529": "But how came you in the bag?",
  "53530": "Let us hide him away, and who is the wiser?",
  "53531": "How acts the judge?",
  "53532": "And you'll go?",
  "53533": "Have you any ideas?",
  "53534": "You heard?",
  "53535": "What's to be the wonder now?",
  "53536": "But was he himself convinced of the accuracy of this explanation?",
  "53537": "Did you lose some of your teeth, the reason your voice sounds so funny?",
  "53538": "Hang it, what's that?",
  "53539": "How like you them, signior?",
  "53540": "What has she been saying to you?",
  "53541": "Why should he take all this trouble?",
  "53542": "Can you manage that?",
  "53543": "What payment?",
  "53544": "Till what?",
  "53545": "Or, if obtained, what can it amount to, but new disgraces, contentions and quarrels?",
  "53546": "I, sir?",
  "53547": "Is not general incivility the very essence of love?",
  "53548": "You persist, then?",
  "53549": "What is this story?",
  "53550": "So we're as we were?",
  "53551": "Of course he doesn't like it, and what can I say when he comes to me?",
  "53552": "Do you still see as much of him as ever?",
  "53553": "Who would have ever believed it?",
  "53554": "Forever?",
  "53555": "You are happy, my dear father?",
  "53556": "Can I spare the time to walk with you, sir?",
  "53557": "Why didn't you come in afore?",
  "53558": "You know, I suppose, who I married?",
  "53559": "Must not people take their chances in this world?",
  "53560": "Where were you, then?",
  "53561": "You won't leave me, general, will you?",
  "53562": "Is there life in the moon?",
  "53563": "How is that?",
  "53564": "What's his game in the matter?",
  "53565": "But what had it to do with the crime?",
  "53566": "Well, if you did?",
  "53567": "Why don't you put him to something?",
  "53568": "And you said nothing?",
  "53569": "Well, are you ready?",
  "53570": "Can you get near enough to throw shells into the city?",
  "53571": "How could they then prevent the pirates from landing?",
  "53572": "Shall we expect some transatlantic military giant to step the ocean and crush us at a blow?",
  "53573": "Why didn't you bring it?",
  "53574": "Do you call it a cheerful language, now?",
  "53575": "Have you answered the question I put to you on entering the room?",
  "53576": "Some poetry?",
  "53577": "Was it possible for me to expect in a lady of such high rank, a constancy proof against my want of address to support it?",
  "53578": "How do you account for what my father saw and heard there?",
  "53579": "Do you come a long way from here?",
  "53580": "You have a message for me?",
  "53581": "Where, sire?",
  "53582": "What do you mean by wrong?",
  "53583": "Has he not thrice refused?",
  "53584": "O, whither shall I flee?",
  "53585": "But what did that amount to?",
  "53586": "Can you produce him?",
  "53587": "What's amiss now, eh?",
  "53588": "If I am here at six it will do, I suppose?",
  "53589": "What else do we need?",
  "53590": "Aren't you hungry?",
  "53591": "But shall I put my foot on his neck, I, of all men, when he is falling a prey to the intrigues of a pack of women and clerks?",
  "53592": "That surprises you, does it?",
  "53593": "If there be no life similar to ours in animals, how could we sustain our life by subsisting on them?",
  "53594": "Could this be a desirable condition for a young country to be in?",
  "53595": "How, then, could the attractiveness of labor serve us as a principle and lever, when it is still our object and our end?",
  "53596": "Finished with your uncle?",
  "53597": "Do the pale faces love their children less in the morning than at night?",
  "53598": "Were his companions dead with him?",
  "53599": "Boots, clothes, bread?",
  "53600": "In all candor let me ask, was such a system for benefiting the few at the expense of the many ever before devised?",
  "53601": "Would they perceive peoples, herds of lunar animals, towns, lakes, seas?",
  "53602": "Ha?",

  "53604": "And the nose?",
  "53605": "And WHO is it that must come some day?",
  "53606": "I wonder what'll become of MY name when I go in?",
  "53607": "What happened to the roses?",
  "53608": "And you knew how to make that calculation?",
  "53609": "Now, what should she give it him for?",
  "53610": "Have you got a sore throat?",
  "53611": "Are you settisfawd nah?",
  "53612": "And what are you blushing for again?",
  "53613": "What's going on?",
  "53614": "Shall we go?",

  "53650": "Then what do I recommend?",
  "53651": "I have been injured, but what does this signify?",
  "53652": "Who can have authorized such an institution?",
  "53653": "Not the drains, I hope?",
  "53654": "What have you done with your candle?",
  "53655": "Yes, but what is a girl to do who has no family?",
  "53656": "Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of it?",
  "53657": "Ever since I come here, you've been out of your senses, and what would have been the good of telling you then?",
  "53658": "And you receive silver from that man?",
  "53659": "Shall I say imprisonment?",
  "53660": "Does it indeed?",
  "53661": "In other terms, is it not the absolute, of which we are only the relative?",
  "53662": "Look, comes he not?",
  "53663": "What is there new in this?",
  "53664": "What will you do with him, madame?",
  "53665": "How can it be lawful that this youth should live for a single hour?",

  "53669": "Will you not carry that monster away?",
  "53670": "Time for what?",
  "53671": "You would, perhaps, think me rude if I inquired in return whether you are a philanthropist?",
  "53672": "Pray let me know who you really are?",
  "53673": "Can I have a few minutes' talk with you?",
  "53674": "I beg your pardon, ma'am?",
  "53675": "But why the mischief didn't he say so?",
  "53676": "Was pretty good fight, wa'n't it?",

  "53679": "And has he found consolation?",
  "53680": "What angel is that I see?",
  "53681": "Is she resurrected?",
  "53682": "And are these lodgings, these appurtenances, fit for the 'gentleman' he says I am?",
  "53683": "Have YOU been making that horrible noise?",
  "53684": "And may I know whose voice mine so closely resembles?",
  "53685": "What other changes have come upon me, besides the changes in my growth and looks, and in the knowledge I have garnered all this while?",
  "53686": "What hand thy hand?",
  "53687": "What could this man, who was reproved, say to that woman, who was dead?",
  "53688": "Can you see?",

  "53694": "Why do you?",
  "53695": "How did you get me out?",
  "53696": "Ah, what else is there?",
  "53697": "Ah, poor wretch, when was your lip pressed before by such pure kisses?",
  "53698": "Besides, how should a woman void of reflection be capable of educating her children?",
  "53699": "How's the game?",
  "53700": "Whether I was at all in danger of being hanged?",
  "53701": "What did you answer him?",
  "53702": "So you intend then to remain with me whether I like it or no?",
  "53703": "Why does it cry and resist before it is hurt?",
  "53704": "To whom do all these fine clothes and moccasins belong?",
  "53705": "And would you marry a woman like that, now?",
  "53706": "Perhaps you don't even love her?",
  "53707": "Sore?",
  "53708": "Might I not myself be mistaken?",
  "53709": "How could we know it?",
  "53710": "Who will affirm that I intended to take possession of this ship and deliver it into the hands of the convicts?",
  "53711": "Do you hear this, signior?",
  "53712": "This, then, is the slab?",

  "54517": "Maybe you could take one of my bad ones, now?",
  "54518": "What is the name or title of the officer in charge of these guards?",
  "54519": "What had they to be afraid of?",
  "54520": "Was it only a pretty child after all?",
  "54521": "You are not going to take part in it?",
  "54522": "The presidente, then?",
  "54523": "Well, what is your conclusion?",
  "54524": "Why don't they send supports?",
  "54525": "But he has got a big mouth, hasn't he, now?",
  "54526": "No, what is it?",
  "54527": "But what was this hair like?",
  "54528": "Did you hear me ask you where you have come from?",
  "54529": "Only two months since you stood here?",
  "54530": "But is the disease so ridiculous in him as it is made?",
  "54531": "Did she know what it was?",
  "54532": "What did you see?",
  "54533": "I understand you to be now consulting me professionally as to your interests?",
  "54534": "And the duke, I suppose, has the key?",
  "54535": "Do you mean that I'm a freak?",
  "54536": "But how do you look upon the fate, sir, which awaits you?",
  "54537": "But what is useful expenditure?",
  "54538": "Going away, aren't you?",
  "54539": "And that her grandmother's cat may now have no one to polish its teeth?",
  "54540": "Will they let it stop at that?",
  "54541": "What have I betrayed?",
  "54542": "What is he good for?",
  "54543": "You wish it to be kept secret?",
  "54544": "Was not this other lady a pleasant person?",
  "54545": "That I love someone else?",
  "54546": "How old would the son be?",
  "54547": "What's happened to you?",
  "54548": "How will it now go henceforth?",
  "54549": "Will you not set him free?",
  "54550": "What good are they?",
  "54551": "Where yeh hit, ol' boy?",
  "54552": "D'Arnot?",
  "54553": "And both flourish?",
  "54554": "Would you stick a knife into me if you had the chance?",
  "54555": "May I go now?",
  "54556": "Can't we bide here?",
  "54557": "You don't know the gentlemen here?",
  "54558": "Surely you wouldn't like that?",
  "54559": "To such arguments what could have been answered?",
  "54560": "Haven't I told you o't fifty times?",
  "54561": "Why did I rush upon my fate?",
  "54562": "But in what position are we going to attack him?",
  "54563": "Is he safe?",
  "54564": "What were these villains after but money?",
  "54565": "And pretty?",
  "54566": "How came you here at all?",
  "54567": "Still in the wine trade?",
  "54568": "What is the good of reading, what is the good of learning anything, for just six months?",
  "54569": "What has become of her, then?",
  "54570": "Won't you give me some?",
  "54571": "And you say you can penetrate it?",
  "54572": "If he wants it, where is his nobility?",
  "54573": "And you understand heraldry?",
  "54574": "Where are grace, beauty, and blandishments, like those?",
  "54575": "Wellington?",
  "54576": "You asked, what has driven me to flight at last?",
  "54577": "Did you get blown up?",
  "54578": "Is it against you or against myself?",
  "54579": "When will it take place?",
  "54580": "Will you permit me to be absent for three days?",
  "54581": "What's it all about?",
  "54582": "Surely these tombstones are not all wrong?",
  "54583": "May you tell me whither?",
  "54584": "Oh, is this the boy?",
  "54585": "Ow'm I to know that?",
  "54586": "Isn't that delightfully romantic?",
  "54587": "How many did we crush under the wall?",
  "54588": "When have you ever spoken like that before?",
  "54589": "But you said I might go, father?",
  "54590": "Now what you going to do?",
  "54591": "Would he not come next morning, if he could?",
  "54592": "What does that say?",
  "54593": "How goes it?",
  "54594": "And the florid face?",
  "54595": "And you will not compromise yourself?",
  "54596": "Why it that?",
  "54597": "Ought they to smoke like that?",
  "54598": "Matter?",
  "54599": "Had she seen him again?",
  "54600": "What ails him?",
  "54601": "How did my soul rise again out of those sepulchres?",
  "54602": "And what have you been doing since yesterday?",
  "54603": "Should we go on?",
  "54604": "Did you imply that he has children of his own, sir?",
  "54605": "Do you by chance happen to think of establishing a telegraph?",
  "54606": "What right have we to make these charges?",
  "54607": "And how's this for high?",
  "54608": "How did she murder?",
  "54609": "Are we ready?",
  "54610": "Whose is this little boy?",
  "54611": "You engaged all these men yourself?",
  "54612": "But your honor will look at the baby?",
  "54613": "And if the husband is kind and straightforward, why should not love last?",
  "54614": "Charge?",
  "54615": "Well, then, these tracks upon the grass, were they coming or going?",
  "54616": "Through this window?",
  "54617": "What iss happened?",
  "54618": "How many hundred dollars, now, do you put on for this religion?",
  "54619": "Have I done anything to vex you, grandmother?",
  "54620": "And you only married him on that account?",
  "54621": "All set?",
  "54622": "Do you swear that to me?",
  "54623": "Should the aim of punishment be the reformation of the criminal?",
  "54624": "And will these save our lives?",
  "54625": "Is that question in the interests of science too?",
  "54626": "Eh, my pretty?",
  "54627": "Have you entire confidence in your chief officer?",
  "54628": "Is not this true?",
  "54629": "But what has happened?",
  "54630": "What at our hands demand ye?",
  "54631": "What could either do, that I cannot?",
  "54632": "What therefore do you pretend to?",
  "54633": "But those who brought you up?",
  "54634": "Then it must be an ellipse?",
  "54635": "Haven't you seen enough?",
  "54636": "Have we taken alive an inhabitant of the seas of primitive ages?",
  "54637": "Then, why not come away with me?",
  "54638": "Where did he live?",
  "54639": "Or is this pretty artifice contrived, to signify that here the chase must end, and my pursuit be crowned, for you can fly no further?",
  "54640": "Why has so violent a movement been followed by so long a repose?",
  "54641": "A lover?",
  "54642": "But isn't it really an illusion to think you can get out of it?",
  "54643": "What's wrang?",
  "54644": "Don't you remember what reply he gave?",
  "54645": "Can they have finished ploughing?",
  "54646": "Is there any one forgotten thing afore we parts?",
  "54647": "But surely one can do that sometimes?",
  "54648": "Sylvestre?",
  "54649": "And why should your majesty suspect me of dissimulation, I ask?",
  "54650": "Has something special happened?",
  "54651": "Why not try and please us this time?",
  "54652": "How could you behave so unfairly by your sister?",
  "54653": "Am I to believe there's anything real in what you say?",
  "54654": "That's all?",
  "54655": "Why did you suffer him to live?",
  "54656": "Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends?",
  "54657": "Would you like to inhale it for a second?",
  "54658": "Is he not prorsus inutilis ad thorum?",
  "54659": "Do you mean that there is no such maker or creator, or that in one sense there might be a maker of all these things but in another not?",
  "54660": "Well, little girl, what is it?",
  "54661": "Do not you feel a certain vibration of the soil?",
  "54662": "What is that machine?",
  "54663": "Are you quite sure?",
  "54664": "You were going to say?",
  "54665": "Where did these things take place?",
  "54666": "What did you say?",
  "54667": "How do you know where to go to?",
  "54668": "To you and myself?",
  "54669": "Have you recovered the lost tracks?",
  "54670": "Now what does this mean?",
  "54671": "What does it matter to you now, in any case?",
  "54672": "Our father?",
  "54673": "Children, who'd like to race the horses with me?",
  "54674": "Never mind, never mind, what does it matter?",
  "54675": "What o'clock was this?",
  "54676": "And would you just throw in a nod when I seem to ask you for it?",
  "54677": "What was he to say?",
  "54678": "And what is your success?",
  "54679": "Isn't it large?",
  "54680": "That's a most puzzling expression for a natural science man, do you understand?",
  "54681": "Was he not made?",
  "54682": "Would an exchange of name be an exchange of rights?",
  "54683": "And have we, any on us, yet come so low as he come?",
  "54684": "At the same place?",
  "54685": "Have you no longer any kind feeling for your father?",
  "54686": "Out, even to me?",
  "54687": "Do you know?",
  "54688": "The tide?",
  "54689": "Did you receive my little note the day before yesterday?",
  "54690": "What sort of a report would they bring of the result?",
  "54691": "And what are you jawing for like that?",
  "54692": "What did you see?",
  "54693": "Going to see the pictures?",
  "54694": "But who should be the executioner?",
  "54695": "And what was that working?",
  "54696": "What are you going to do about him?",
  "54697": "You are not worse, are you?",
  "54698": "Why not go right down now and fix him?",
  "54699": "If I name one fact you don't know, will you give me back my rifle?",
  "54700": "You may have recognized the fumes?",
  "54701": "Oh, what does that matter?",
  "54702": "From whom did you get this?",
  "54703": "Who do you reckon 't is?",
  "54704": "Why did he not break it there, since it is evident that every yard that he carried it increased the risk of someone meeting him?",
  "54705": "Which I took hold of and was merrily asking him what he would take to have it said for my honour that it was of my getting?",
  "54706": "How did it come to be cut like that?",
  "54707": "Why do you trample upon dead bodies in this temple?",
  "54708": "Whence have you come?",
  "54709": "And how did it happen?",
  "54710": "What do you consider to be the greatest blessing which you have reaped from your wealth?",
  "54711": "Where got she the strength to resist the impulse?",
  "54712": "Anything I like?",
  "54713": "Micawber?",
  "54714": "Are you a large party?",
  "54715": "What were our feelings at that moment?",
  "54716": "Where are you running to?",
  "54717": "A document?",
  "54718": "Do you not reckon me?",
  "54719": "MATERIALS?",
  "54720": "Will any antiquarian inform us, if possible, why these bones were placed here?",
  "54721": "And what do you call these, my darling?",
  "54722": "As to you, monseigneur?",
  "54723": "And had he any right to ask her for a revelation of feelings which she had evidently intended to withhold from him?",
  "54724": "Which of the three is it?",
  "54725": "What do I say?",
  "54726": "And you heard what he said?",
  "54727": "Will you give them to me?",
  "54728": "Well, and what have you been doing?",
  "54729": "Why are there no daffodils now?",
  "54730": "Is it not a happy feeling?",
  "54731": "Why sacrifice forty?",
  "54732": "Where's that ten cents?",
  "54733": "And if he left off dreaming about you, where do you suppose you'd be?",
  "54734": "With your brother?",
  "54735": "Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy?",
  "54736": "Can't you see, you're killing me?",
  "54737": "Now, dear, what are your own?",
  "54738": "I suffer from emotion?",
  "54739": "What laws are there for us?",
  "54740": "And shall she have the head she covets?",
  "54741": "Would she go out to work again?",
  "54742": "Where did I disappear to?",
  "54743": "And you have no way to get news of them?",
  "54744": "Again the law?",
  "54745": "Aunt, will you have some beef?",
  "54746": "Saw her?",
  "54747": "But I must know that you love me, mustn't I?",
  "54748": "Shall we get out and try to find the road?",
  "54749": "You found something compromising?",
  "54750": "Do you see this letter?",
  "54751": "The gentleman who receives us?",
  "54752": "Where de debble did you come frum?",
  "54753": "Has my father asked you for money?",
  "54754": "Who are you, that you should question the judgment of the nations and the ages?",
  "54755": "What would they do in that case?",
  "54756": "You have not counted me out as equal to so much land, and calculated on me as a balance at your banker's?",
  "54757": "Do you know what this plant is?",
  "54758": "Was he awake, or was it but a dream?",
  "54759": "I wonder where we can go next?",
  "54760": "Are you thinking, if I'm drunk itself, I'd leave my daughter living single with a little frisky rascal is the like of you?",
  "54761": "And what awaits you if you remain faithful to your oath, and obey the commands given you?",
  "54762": "Sire, have you in the army one regiment on which you can implicitly rely?",
  "54763": "Will it take long?",
  "54764": "What's that pump stopping for?",
  "54765": "But then, why do you repulse me?",
  "54766": "Are you willing?",
  "54767": "Have I any?",
  "54768": "I wish you'd lend me half a sovereign, will you?",
  "54769": "No, really?",
  "54770": "Can't you see those good people, with a totally strange woman bursting into their house?",
  "54771": "Has he left you for another?",
  "54772": "Can we really affect the adversary's will?",
  "54773": "Shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the sea?",
  "54774": "Was it possible for her to forgive him?",
  "54775": "D'you like all that frilly, bunchy stuff at the throat?",
  "54776": "What purpose do they serve?",
  "54777": "Oh is it?",
  "54778": "Were all those dear, sorrowful, valiant, charming or tragic beings merely dreams?",
  "54779": "Is there anything of the feminine gender among them?",
  "54780": "Lodging?",
  "54781": "Not his brother?",
  "54782": "And which of them made this passage?",
  "54783": "Not more?",
  "54784": "Has he been examined by any synod or council?",
  "54785": "Have you any objection to see him in my presence?",
  "54786": "But what about them at home?",
  "54787": "I must have been ordered abroad, but how could I have gone?",
  "54788": "What is the difference between light and the lustre which is seen on the polished surface of opaque bodies?",
  "54789": "Now, ma'am, am I a fool?",
  "54790": "You know who that is?",
  "54791": "Had she left no friends, no relations behind her?",
  "54792": "What are you doing?",
  "54793": "You will, won't you, dear?",
  "54794": "You'll take me as I am, with nothing?",
  "54795": "Things are all right with you then?",
  "54796": "Ought he to turn to the left or to the right?",
  "54797": "Who dares?",
  "54798": "But how did you manage it, little pa?",
  "54799": "Some what?",
  "54800": "Do you give it to me?",
  "54801": "Tell me, are you human, or are you more than human?",
  "54802": "And you have not made her speak?",
  "54803": "Took hold of you?",
  "54804": "Have you not talked long enough to drink?",
  "54805": "How can you be so cruel to me?",
  "54806": "Are you better?",
  "54807": "Who is it that you have fallen in love with, my poor fellow?",
  "54808": "Come, come, who did you think we were when you ran away from us?",
  "54809": "But what do you require of me, then?",
  "54810": "Do you like roses?",
  "54811": "Not just yet?",
  "54812": "Was there ever a loser content with the loss of the game?",
  "54813": "Going?",
  "54814": "What's the colour of their stockings?",
  "54815": "Why do you look at us like that?",
  "54816": "Does his daughter know of the relapse?",
  "54817": "Is it not a pity that people who are bright and clever should so often be exceedingly improper?",
  "54818": "What did it all mean?",
  "54819": "Would you like a little mash?",
  "54820": "And what salary do you ask?",
  "54821": "I s'pose you'll be starting off for college in a fortnight's time?",
  "54822": "Did you see a young lad passing this way in the early morning or the fall of night?",
  "54823": "How can you say so?",
  "54824": "Could inertia of race, on such a scale, be broken up, or take new form?",
  "54825": "And how did he treat you?",
  "54826": "You, dear mamma?",
  "54827": "What line shall you take, then?",
  "54828": "Towards a new sun?",
  "54829": "May I come in, guardian?",
  "54830": "Has he finished his turn?",
  "54831": "Mahotin?",
  "54832": "Yet why did he come?",
  "54833": "There are those sharks now over the side, don't you see they prefer it tough and rare?",
  "54834": "If you decide to go, why shouldn't you go in the same ship?",
  "54835": "Is it as bad as all that?",
  "54836": "How old are you and what's your name?",
  "54837": "Are the others coming out?",
  "54838": "Are you certain that you can afford to part with so much money, and that it is right that it should be so expended?",
  "54839": "Queer notion, wasn't it?",
  "54840": "Was that last night?",
  "54841": "And is the gentleman who fired at us the governor of the fortress?",
  "54842": "Is my pa in, do you know?",
  "54843": "Is that all?",
  "54844": "Won't you join us?",
  "54845": "Was this ever possible?",
  "54846": "Their hair?",
  "54847": "Did they leave these two industries to themselves?",
  "54848": "Do they by attaching to the soul and inhering in her at last bring her to death, and so separate her from the body ?",
  "54849": "Have you been slightly dazzled at the sudden fusion of my ingots?",
  "54850": "Perhaps you did not like it?",
  "54851": "Did he look in this way?",
  "54852": "To me?",
  "54853": "But, look here, are you a great hand with the ladies?",
  "54854": "Have you?",
  "54855": "Was he a man or only a crosseyed thief an a loafer?",
  "54856": "Or was he ordered to inflict this punishment upon me?",
  "54857": "Is that all the story?",
  "54858": "None of it at all?",
  "54859": "And how do you find home, now you have come back to it?",
  "54860": "Do you suppose you could find any good in a child by whipping him?",
  "54861": "Is it the secret instinct of decaying nature, or the soul's impulsive throb, as immortality draws on?",
  "54862": "Who was the youth he had adopted and who bore so striking a resemblance to him?",
  "54863": "You wouldn't like to marry a small tradesman or a working man, would you?",
  "54864": "And his offence?",
  "54865": "Are you sure you are not making a mistake?",
  "54866": "You mean your papers?",
  "54867": "It is a poor conclusion, is it not?",
  "54868": "It may also be called temperate, and for the same reasons?",
  "54869": "Don't you think agricultural laborers would rather have three acres and a cow than three acres of printed forms and a committee?",
  "54870": "But surely this is somewhat irrelevant?",
  "54871": "Was it very vile to be dragged back here again?",
  "54872": "Can you break an engagement off slowly?",
  "54873": "Do you wish to ruin us outright?",
  "54874": "Any how does she do?",
  "54875": "You called me a creature of civilization, or something, didn't you?",
  "54876": "Neckett's children?",
  "54877": "Safe?",
  "54878": "My friends, why do I wish for peace?",
  "54879": "Won't you even stay for tea?",
  "54880": "Can he speak?",
  "54881": "And why not with you?",
  "54882": "Well, do you like it?",
  "54883": "What was she to do?",
  "54884": "But can you make any sense out of them?",
  "54885": "He was not playing, then?",
  "54886": "Rosamond a sufferer, a labourer, a female apostle?",
  "54887": "Who could grant them?",
  "54888": "What were you saying about being married?",
  "54889": "That's it, ain't it?",
  "54890": "Was he engaged in a struggle with some animal whose retreat he had disturbed?",
  "54891": "But certain, if execution be remiss or blindfold now, and in this particular, what will it be hereafter and in other books?",
  "54892": "Did he sign, too?",
  "54893": "You're not angry with me any more?",
  "54894": "Have you considered what it is to undermine the confidence that should subsist between my daughter and myself?",
  "54895": "How long will this fuse burn?",
  "54896": "Why do you hesitate?",
  "54897": "How can I ever describe the charm and picturesqueness of that summer life?",
  "54898": "May I write to you?",
  "54899": "This will be your luggage, I suppose?",
  "54900": "How could that bring you?",
  "54901": "But all our praises why should lords engross?",
  "54902": "And what then would you say?",
  "54903": "There might possibly be some hundreds, and what could three men do, even armed to the teeth, against such a multitude?",
  "54904": "What is your opinion on the matter?",
  "54905": "Pictures are like wine, and want age, you think?",
  "54906": "Where is the entrance?",
  "54907": "The barricade?",
  "54908": "What is life at all?",
  "54909": "If you please, sir, should I have no brandy nor nothing to give the poor creetur?",
  "54910": "Is he kind to her?",
  "54911": "Who is conducting the prosecution?",
  "54912": "Is it mingled with anger or hate?",
  "54913": "What had he to do, indeed?",
  "54914": "Why, what, madam, does it signify what I think?",
  "54915": "Will it be believed that the night of so brilliant a day was for me a night of anguish and perplexity?",
  "54916": "Is not this an agreeable surprise?",
  "54917": "What can you not understand?",
  "54918": "Yes, but where?",
  "54919": "What did you burn 'em for?",

  "55717": "Your wound?",
  "55718": "Why, did you know her, papa?",
  "55719": "Why was that corner chosen to write it on?",
  "55720": "How can one believe a woman after that?",
  "55721": "Why give it as a reason for not coming now?",
  "55722": "Only that?",
  "55723": "What is thy name?",
  "55724": "What do you think he wants to do?",
  "55725": "What ails us gazing where all seen is hollow?",
  "55726": "And when you want to buy a ship, the shipwright or the pilot would be better?",
  "55727": "How do you know that?",
  "55728": "How could it be possible for us to disobey your commands?",
  "55729": "But in what sense?",
  "55730": "About whom?",
  "55731": "Where, where are you going to?",
  "55732": "Why not you also?",
  "55733": "Wouldn't it be fun?",
  "55734": "After her having been what she was?",
  "55735": "Did you know that this little girl had disappeared?",
  "55736": "It was you, then, who wrote to him?",
  "55737": "What would you have me do?",
  "55738": "How can I dare to form a scheme, when I am aware that the chance of success must be so strong against me?",
  "55739": "Have you gone cracked, my good friend?",
  "55740": "You won't think any more about that extra threepence, will you?",
  "55741": "How else can we explain her frenzied anxiety that her second one should not enter it?",
  "55742": "If this be the design of it, who can so properly be the inquisitors for the nation as the representatives of the nation themselves?",
  "55743": "Why spoil those apples?",
  "55744": "If the charge be incapacity, what evidence will support it?",
  "55745": "Do you play then?",
  "55746": "Will he ever return?",
  "55747": "Are there any witnesses?",
  "55748": "What is life, and what is death?",
  "55749": "What would happen then?",
  "55750": "Was this the banquet he prepar'd for us?",
  "55751": "If so, what became of them in those dreadful days?",
  "55752": "How can we here?",
  "55753": "Did he understand that he had made a grave mistake?",
  "55754": "Nor courage either?",
  "55755": "Oh, isn't it all right?",
  "55756": "Now will you do what I want you to?",
  "55757": "No light repartee, have you, old bean?",
  "55758": "Some people said it was because he couldn't sell it, but I'd rather believe that it was out of the kindness of his heart, wouldn't you?",
  "55759": "How did you word your inquiries?",
  "55760": "Can we not avoid them by keeping to the shore?",
  "55761": "Is it improper and unsafe to intermix the different powers of government in the same body of men?",
  "55762": "Do you promise to deliver it?",
  "55763": "How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil?",
  "55764": "So you won't be my friend?",
  "55765": "Who are you?",
  "55766": "What is your name?",
  "55767": "Did you see him then?",
  "55768": "Then I suppose I was to hold my tongue and say nothing?",
  "55769": "And you don't care for women at all after twenty?",
  "55770": "How could the fruits follow?",
  "55771": "His name?",
  "55772": "Why the devil have they any stairs with such windows?",
  "55773": "What made you open it?",
  "55774": "You have seen him at work?",
  "55775": "Where else can I ask him?",
  "55776": "But can we not descend?",
  "55777": "Pip, will you tell me something?",
  "55778": "What lunacy is this, that haunts this man?",
  "55779": "Say, how long are you going to stay here?",
  "55780": "How shall I make my music now?",
  "55781": "Can I never act for you, and you for me?",
  "55782": "Do you think it is true?",
  "55783": "How would you like that?",
  "55784": "Why is she so excruciatingly beautiful that I cannot be angry with her, even now?",
  "55785": "That is your affair?",
  "55786": "You know he shot his brother?",
  "55787": "What noise was that?",
  "55788": "What would you give that you could help loving me?",
  "55789": "Do we suppose that principle, whatever it may be in man, which has to do with justice and injustice, to be inferior to the body?",
  "55790": "Yes, what it is?",
  "55791": "Where had he seen those lineaments?",
  "55792": "Of what was I speaking?",
  "55793": "Never in moderation?",
  "55794": "Is the other one stuffed also?",
  "55795": "What best wishes?",
  "55796": "I mean the one with the three naked women?",
  "55797": "Why, who else could I possibly suspect?",
  "55798": "What made you leave me to come here alone?",
  "55799": "Something will turn up?",
  "55800": "Abandon this subject altogether, and again jeer at the monks and ridicule the nuns?",
  "55801": "Have these very matters ever produced any difficulty amongst us?",
  "55802": "Have I not also critics who do not spare me?",
  "55803": "What avails recrimination over matters wholly past recall?",
  "55804": "It die?",
  "55805": "But if he had escaped?",
  "55806": "Who was that insolent fellow?",
  "55807": "What new mystery was this?",
  "55808": "What do I think of it?",
  "55809": "Won't you ever change your mind?",
  "55810": "If I were alone, would he not at times force his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or to contemplate its progress?",
  "55811": "Is not this unavoidable?",
  "55812": "Have you spoken to her?",
  "55813": "But what could it do, if any danger came?",
  "55814": "That would be good, wouldn't it?",
  "55815": "Could it be for any other reason than that he did not want to see it, and if so was he not a traitor to the cause of truth?",
  "55816": "Why are better results attained under scientific management than under the other types?",
  "55817": "Ah, a weapon?",
  "55818": "Run away?",
  "55819": "What was he, then?",
  "55820": "Matter?",
  "55821": "Not paralysis, I hope?",
  "55822": "Run away?",
  "55823": "What does he say?",
  "55824": "Why is it that the peace of the country is disturbed in order that one people may assume to judge of what another people should do?",
  "55825": "So you think he'll make her an offer today?",
  "55826": "But where is he?",
  "55827": "Don't you want to tell me?",
  "55828": "It beseemeth us both better, forsooth, to leave this undone, for why should I honor one who doth bear me hatred?",
  "55829": "It was the only letter you had?",
  "55830": "You have no explanation yourself of the tragedy?",
  "55831": "What do you mean by having made a stiff?",
  "55832": "What different armour should I need?",
  "55833": "Should he abandon her?",
  "55834": "Who is with him?",
  "55835": "Can you bear witness that you're no better than a fool?",
  "55836": "It will be asked, how did this mischief happen?",
  "55837": "What should I do with a translation?",
  "55838": "You did not get my letter?",
  "55839": "By whom was she espied, and how entrapped?",
  "55840": "And weren't you ever afraid?",
  "55841": "Is she a very massive person?",
  "55842": "And what is your opinion?",
  "55843": "Perchance you think to put him i' the thick of the shots?",
  "55844": "According to scientific notions of inertia and force, what ought to be the result?",
  "55845": "And your address?",
  "55846": "What sort of husband can he be?",
  "55847": "How do they use to be?",
  "55848": "Why should we?",
  "55849": "What are you doing there, you rascal?",
  "55850": "Convicts?",
  "55851": "Why, then, are you about to betray it to me?",
  "55852": "But even in that case, may he have no object beyond his present station, to which he may sacrifice his independence?",
  "55853": "And powder, and bullets?",
  "55854": "Would you believe, my dear friend, that the persons to whom I made these candid protestations laughed at my credulity?",
  "55855": "Have you had one of your bad nights?",
  "55856": "What, my friends, must be the consequences of this agitation?",
  "55857": "Can I do anything for you, gentlemen?",
  "55858": "Is he not a beauty?",
  "55859": "Could he still rise and regain his footing in his conscience upon something solid?",
  "55860": "Don't you know it?",
  "55861": "Is it not indeed great enough, sire?",
  "55862": "Are you ambitious, and do you seek after the greatnesses of the earth?",
  "55863": "When they have no leaves and look gray and brown and dry, how can you tell whether they are dead or alive?",
  "55864": "Would we be able to see those pictures?",
  "55865": "Then if children make so much trouble, why do people have 'em?",
  "55866": "And you never confined your patients?",
  "55867": "How could you be so obstinate?",
  "55868": "Tom, what on earth ails that cat?",
  "55869": "Then I did not kill him?",
  "55870": "If he had not had his 'profonde' what would he have done?",
  "55871": "What is to be done with her, then?",
  "55872": "Do you know what it is?",
  "55873": "I do something?",
  "55874": "Which way went he, young man?",
  "55875": "Are you coming to this ball?",
  "55876": "Why did he not correct our judgment at the start?",
  "55877": "How can one deceive these dear little birds, when they look at one so sweetly and confidingly?",
  "55878": "Is wealth thy passion?",
  "55879": "What is the matter at home?",
  "55880": "Is there any sense in it?",
  "55881": "And where is he going?",
  "55882": "Well, what have I to do with that?",
  "55883": "Do you not consume supplies as fast as you get them forward?",
  "55884": "But, what am I saying?",
  "55885": "Shall we try argument?",
  "55886": "She is at home?",
  "55887": "Verdurin?",
  "55888": "Then I asked if there were many clerks?",
  "55889": "How can he talk like that?",
  "55890": "But who gave you leave to cease eating mutton?",
  "55891": "And what can one do?",
  "55892": "Yes, that is the doctor we've been sewing for, is it?",
  "55893": "What pamphlet is this?",
  "55894": "Was it not for these causes that you send for me when the great trouble came?",
  "55895": "May I live with you, and tend upon you as I used to do?",
  "55896": "Will you unclasp your hand?",
  "55897": "Wasn't you bad enough when you threw all the money away, so you had to go an' do this just when we was in awful trouble?",
  "55898": "Why don't you go to your bankers?",
  "55899": "Do you see this same ram?",
  "55900": "Shall I go and offer her my services?",
  "55901": "And why does the minister keep his hand over his heart?",
  "55902": "Who keeps house here?",
  "55903": "Are they not bubbles?",
  "55904": "How is all with you?",
  "55905": "Tasting?",
  "55906": "What are his qualifications?",
  "55907": "Where did you start from?",
  "55908": "Could anything cause us to swerve to one side?",
  "55909": "And are not both the city and the entire temple now full of the dead bodies of your countrymen?",
  "55910": "Couldn't we start out and scour the country before the fellow gets away?",
  "55911": "You dine and sleep here, of course?",
  "55912": "What else could I look for, being what I am, and leading such a life as mine?",
  "55913": "Why didn't you come to dinner?",
  "55914": "Where is this poor giant, or this poor wretch of a vanquished knight, to find her?",
  "55915": "It is the first time, then, that you ever went to that house?",
  "55916": "How may we pass that which is impassable?",
  "55917": "In what stables champed these sleek, nervous horses and rested the gorgeous carriages?",
  "55918": "And what am I to tell your father?",
  "55919": "The box of mischief thus opened in society, what is to preserve private virtue, the only security of public freedom and universal happiness?",
  "55920": "My father is well, is he not?",
  "55921": "Was it going farther from, or nearing, the disc?",
  "55922": "How is this?",
  "55923": "Recollect, my lord, if he did not say something a little like that to you?",
  "55924": "Is he really her cousin, as he says?",
  "55925": "Who's to prevent me?",
  "55926": "Why dig up the pestilence from the pit in which it is buried?",
  "55927": "The other question?",
  "55928": "I may go on?",
  "55929": "And by whom?",
  "55930": "It is true, then?",
  "55931": "Should an ass exceed me in fortitude?",
  "55932": "Would the island hold together till then?",
  "55933": "No, why should you?",
  "55934": "What can I do sir?",
  "55935": "Should I have remained in that house, near you and them, if I did not love them?",
  "55936": "And this letter?",
  "55937": "What d'you charge for a ride, boss?",
  "55938": "What is the matter?",
  "55939": "And if it be so, what is it?",
  "55940": "Mother, what are you crying for?",
  "55941": "Were I to allow you to march out, what security can I have that you will not join them, and afterwards fight against me?",
  "55942": "Reinforcements?",
  "55943": "What would it be right to do?",
  "55944": "What's up with you?",
  "55945": "Should it ever be said that he had robbed those old men, whom he so truly and so tenderly loved in his heart of hearts?",
  "55946": "What made you think he'd ceased to take any interest in the case?",
  "55947": "Is it anything I have done that has pulled you down like that?",
  "55948": "What could my father mean by sending me to be an inmate in this strange family?",
  "55949": "You mean you'll have no quarrel with me?",
  "55950": "Was he awake or was he asleep?",
  "55951": "Well, but if I bought the mill, and allowed your husband to act as my manager in the same way, how then?",
  "55952": "What am I to do if I love him and the other one too?",
  "55953": "And have you come from far like this?",
  "55954": "And what did I tell 'ee?",
  "55955": "Could she, who had been so active in the getting up of the funeral triumph, do less than exult?",
  "55956": "Who now will tell the ladies that I would hie me thither?",
  "55957": "What is genius?",
  "55958": "You have taken care, I hope, of the casket I sent you to lock up?",
  "55959": "What evils?",
  "55960": "And is it wounded?",
  "55961": "What recollections of boyhood and innocence might have been flitting across his brain?",
  "55962": "What noise is that?",
  "55963": "No dignity in whaling?",
  "55964": "Why could they not wait a little?",
  "55965": "No apology, I suppose?",
  "55966": "What are you thinking of?",
  "55967": "How have I offended?",
  "55968": "Why should we be unable to preserve a remembrance of them?",
  "55969": "There is something else you wanted to say?",
  "55970": "Was I not right in saying at the outset that, relatively to the tax, we are behind our institutions?",
  "55971": "What charge, sir?",
  "55972": "Did you see no one?",
  "55973": "Ah, now, couldn't you take me with you?",
  "55974": "Oh, may I get this rose?",
  "55975": "He asked me whether I would go with him?",
  "55976": "A'n't you getting all you hoped for, ay, and more than you hoped for?",
  "55977": "Why did you leave him on the road?",
  "55978": "And in such a case what is one to say?",
  "55979": "Yes, why?",
  "55980": "To which of us?",
  "55981": "Could we not break it?",
  "55982": "What does he drink?",
  "55983": "But however are you going to race in this mud?",
  "55984": "Is this the part of wise men, engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty?",
  "55985": "Cannot you describe her?",
  "55986": "And that which is not more or less a harmony is not more or less harmonized?",
  "55987": "A joke?",
  "55988": "What is his folly?",
  "55989": "I must, then, remain here?",
  "55990": "Who were they?",
  "55991": "Mercenary, mem?",
  "55992": "Well then, my dear, why don't you praise the neatness and prettiness with which it's kept?",
  "55993": "Have you not read in my eyes that there is nothing but devotion and sympathy in my heart?",
  "55994": "Is that worth talking about and making so much ado?",
  "55995": "When are you starting?",
  "55996": "You want no treasures and no castles?",
  "55997": "You will live on our selection, won't you?",
  "55998": "He wouldn't have so much influence, then, don't you reckon?",
  "55999": "Now then, gentlemen, shall I break the seal or not?",
  "56000": "It must have been on the boulevard?",
  "56001": "Could a statue of marble have been more impassive and more mute?",
  "56002": "Would you like to?",
  "56003": "Do you call yourself a raw country girl?",
  "56004": "And, then, do you think that my stumps are pretty?",
  "56005": "But do you fail to live?",
  "56006": "Sure it's he?",
  "56007": "Whose fault?",
  "56008": "She has formed no other attachment?",
  "56009": "What matter?",
  "56010": "And wherefore has he not been to see me?",
  "56011": "Shall we really try it?",
  "56012": "Doth any praise himself?",
  "56013": "Now, then, where's the first boy?",
  "56014": "What has age to do with it?",
  "56015": "What besides?",
  "56016": "Separate, my dear?",
  "56017": "Now, why don't you take my advice?",
  "56018": "Do you wish I hadn't come?",
  "56019": "And alone?",
  "56020": "Why should I pull her into it?",
  "56021": "You would not kill yourself?",
  "56022": "No cheering news, then?",
  "56023": "And with what object?",
  "56024": "Monks would never learn how you knew what you do?",
  "56025": "What do you keep SAYING you will for?",
  "56026": "Was it so?",
  "56027": "But the earl?",
  "56028": "Do you see, now, one reason why I have let you go thus early into the world?",
  "56029": "Will you show me your plan?",
  "56030": "Can't one cut pages with a garden knife?",
  "56031": "What needs appealing in a fact so plain?",
  "56032": "And if he have great riches, to you leave him all his wealth, or do you make him a beggar?",
  "56033": "Bast?",
  "56034": "What was it you wanted to ask, sir?",
  "56035": "Did you ever hear such a name?",
  "56036": "Can it attack it beneath the waves?",
  "56037": "To those who love as ourselves, in what respect differs a year from an hour?",
  "56038": "And you think that just?",
  "56039": "You will start at once?",
  "56040": "To what point of the continent?",
  "56041": "From whence can she come?",
  "56042": "Will you play?",
  "56043": "What's to hinder 'em from cutting right and left if they begin?",
  "56044": "Give up the parish altogether?",
  "56045": "And what was the policy of that ally?",
  "56046": "But who should tell him so?",
  "56047": "Her voice when she talked to them?",
  "56048": "Would the militia, in this supposition, be more ready or more able to support the federal authority than in the case of a general union?",
  "56049": "Is he in favor of all these things at once?",
  "56050": "Or show you restless, miswandering, misclimbing ones, new and easier footpaths?",
  "56051": "Do you think the thing possible?",
  "56052": "Is the door shut?",
  "56053": "But what will you do?",
  "56054": "Well, then, have you any better plan to propose?",
  "56055": "What, have you a wife, then?",
  "56056": "But does nothing depend on it for them?",
  "56057": "You are well?",
  "56058": "You do love me still?",
  "56059": "Where do your excellencies wish to go?",
  "56060": "Then what the devil brought you here, being a churchman?",
  "56061": "You know what to beautify is, I suppose?",
  "56062": "How can I commit such treachery?",
  "56063": "And what is it doing in the world?",
  "56064": "Do you know, sir?",
  "56065": "And what does it amount to, after all?",
  "56066": "By his son, sir?",
  "56067": "But how, madame?",
  "56068": "What course is that?",
  "56069": "What did the gardener say?",
  "56070": "Why cucumber sandwiches?",
  "56071": "A duel, you mean?",
  "56072": "But what is thy name?",
  "56073": "Ma foi, what rival?",
  "56074": "An't that as nat'ral as walking, and as good for the health?",
  "56075": "Do I then strive after HAPPINESS?",
  "56076": "One should never admit anything in electioneering matters, should one?",
  "56077": "Is she game for that?",
  "56078": "Is it void of understanding?",
  "56079": "And who dictated it?",
  "56080": "Was it not this?",
  "56081": "Who's there?",
  "56082": "What next, I wonder?",
  "56083": "What ails you?",
  "56084": "But what of that, so long as it tickles the palate more strongly?",
  "56085": "Is the sea not full of green islands?",
  "56086": "Whence then this obvious DISQUALITY?",
  "56087": "There is a deficit, you say?",
  "56088": "And is it the case now?",
  "56089": "Because you can see she is in love with you?",
  "56090": "Who was the man?",
  "56091": "Where does he tempt one to stray from duty?",
  "56092": "What does it strike you that I've done?",
  "56093": "Money down?",
  "56094": "Jane's mother is going to let her have a birthday party?",
  "56095": "Have you not shelter, and food, and leisure?",
  "56096": "And what can be said in, at least, partial defence of the actual historical procedure of the nations?",
  "56097": "What should I get by sending to you?",
  "56098": "Sailors?",
  "56099": "You found her well and awaiting you?",
  "56100": "Where is it located?",
  "56101": "Didn't the cavalry all start this morning?",
  "56102": "Why, what do you mean?",
  "56103": "What other men can be thirty leagues under ground?",
  "56104": "What, is it laborers they want for the harvest?",
  "56105": "Who shall describe the anxiety, the agony, which in some measure must have been the lot of every frontier family?",
  "56106": "Why didn't we think of that before?",
  "56107": "What the devil are you doing there in such an agitated manner?",

  "56899": "Am I taken prisoner or have I taken him prisoner?",
  "56900": "Do you think that a good man and a bad must share the same fate, and alike die, and end?",
  "56901": "Does it matter?",
  "56902": "What do you go for, then?",
  "56903": "It's almost enough to make us get married after all, isn't it?",
  "56904": "How do you feel now, my love?",
  "56905": "What is this, then?",
  "56906": "Did you want him too to go sailing about amid all kinds of hardship while others are eating up his estate?",
  "56907": "Why don't you go to a hospital?",
  "56908": "You do like it?",
  "56909": "Isn't that a perfectly elegant name?",
  "56910": "And now you know all that you want to know, do you not?",
  "56911": "How shall we express the feelings with which his memory is cherished by those who were honoured with his friendship?",
  "56912": "What's the matter with the man that he isn't good enough for you?",
  "56913": "How should he dare to seek the bottom of it?",
  "56914": "Will you do me that favour?",
  "56915": "Will power, which has received numerous complaints upon this subject, intervene to restore competition and prevent monopoly?",
  "56916": "Can anybody lend me a shilling?",
  "56917": "In what way did you go thither?",
  "56918": "Well, what do you want me to do?",
  "56919": "You know something about him, do you not, madame?",
  "56920": "Beastly, isn't it?",
  "56921": "Presumed?",
  "56922": "Is it all right?",
  "56923": "Can they go on, my father?",
  "56924": "Shall we go on upstairs?",
  "56925": "Or is this a season to revel in?",
  "56926": "You've j'ined a college by this time, I suppose?",
  "56927": "And exactly the same thing happened to both of you?",
  "56928": "You don't understand?",
  "56929": "Shall we follow you?",
  "56930": "Why not exclude every man convicted of any degrading legal crime, even petty larceny?",
  "56931": "How far can they be combined with those other ingredients which constitute safety in the republican sense?",
  "56932": "But advocates and proctors are not one and the same?",
  "56933": "You surely do not mean to let the child dine at eight o'clock?",
  "56934": "Well, what are we to do?",
  "56935": "I hope you won't dislike the trouble of all this?",
  "56936": "By whom can he have been instigated?",
  "56937": "You won't care to stay at home now, perhaps?",
  "56938": "What sort of games are you up to?",
  "56939": "Has he taken off his doublet?",
  "56940": "Have you a sumptuous table, a dashing wife, and gold to scatter, in order to attract them to your suite?",
  "56941": "Did I not understand you to say that, as the consequence of the collision, the character of the comet's orbit has been changed?",
  "56942": "Why, too, should he write a letter now, rather than six years ago?",
  "56943": "All ready?",
  "56944": "Might she have loved me?",
  "56945": "What can you do then?",
  "56946": "Your daughter?",
  "56947": "But where is she?",
  "56948": "But can this be possible?",
  "56949": "No, you do not, do you?",
  "56950": "What help do you want from me?",
  "56951": "Tell me at once that I want to assassinate you?",
  "56952": "Is it not those very persons who mourn for him?",
  "56953": "Did you ever know anybody who was born to it besides myself?",
  "56954": "The first?",
  "56955": "Will he continue, then, to keep our secret?",
  "56956": "Aren't we going to stay here?",
  "56957": "Have I changed so much?",
  "56958": "All your naughty purposes, I make no doubt, were quite changed?",
  "56959": "Despair?",
  "56960": "What does that mean?",
  "56961": "SHALL I TURN THE SCORPION?",
  "56962": "No letter that can possibly have been overlooked?",
  "56963": "Now, father, may I marry my lass?",
  "56964": "Can I, in a theatre, occupy at the same time one place in the pit, another in the boxes, and a third in the gallery?",
  "56965": "Are we not now in her pursuit?",
  "56966": "You will let me help, will you not?",
  "56967": "How can I expect to convince you, if you cannot tell robbery when I show it to you?",
  "56968": "And number three?",
  "56969": "How could I help it?",
  "56970": "What would the minister have said, mother?",
  "56971": "Plague on't, my lord, have you brought me here to get my horoscope out of me?",
  "56972": "Do you suppose that I am afraid to die?",
  "56973": "How many all told?",
  "56974": "Or are they the inflammatory ravings of incendiaries or distempered enthusiasts?",
  "56975": "What letters?",
  "56976": "Will it not be better that she should keep the resentment of the insult for ever?",
  "56977": "Why do they wish to kill you, m'sieur?",
  "56978": "What could be the cause of this phenomenon?",
  "56979": "Or whether it eats and drinks?",
  "56980": "But what would you say in it?",
  "56981": "May I go up and speak to her?",
  "56982": "Manager of the company or the house?",
  "56983": "Did he think I'd flinch from his bottle?",
  "56984": "Did they want to cut his chin off?",
  "56985": "But how did my father know that I had gone this road and in this dress?",
  "56986": "Was he her grandfather?",
  "56987": "Let him go free?",
  "56988": "When an apple has ripened and falls, why does it fall?",
  "56989": "Who could it have been?",
  "56990": "Do you wish for any further details?",
  "56991": "How many now are there whom we have known in life?",
  "56992": "And who thus designated it?",
  "56993": "What gives, or can give it, or should give it?",
  "56994": "Was she born so?",
  "56995": "What advice do you offer to society, to the country, in alarm?",
  "56996": "Where are the officers?",
  "56997": "You have found peace?",
  "56998": "Can you believe that I should be so low, so base, as to lose money in that way?",
  "56999": "But what I mean is, where do I come in?",
  "57000": "If you have an officer and he does wrong, do you suffer him to remain in office, or do you set up another in his stead?",
  "57001": "What is your opinion of it?",
  "57002": "Do you understand what that means?",
  "57003": "What are you up to?",
  "57004": "It is only, is it, because we have made no defence, and have led them into a false supposition?",
  "57005": "Are they equals in the same sense in which absolute equality is equal?",
  "57006": "What does he do to prevent further misfortune?",
  "57007": "Well, you know of course that the greater is relative to the less?",
  "57008": "ARE you happy?",
  "57009": "Do I really look the same as usual?",
  "57010": "What is your trade?",
  "57011": "Is he going to pass the night in that fashion?",
  "57012": "But why should we dispute about names when we have realities of such importance to consider?",
  "57013": "What a senseless fellow you are, really?",
  "57014": "A count, and a rich one too, eh?",
  "57015": "Wasn't I very ill?",
  "57016": "Where is she now?",
  "57017": "Shall we terminate our conference for the night?",
  "57018": "Stars have fallen from heaven, and what shall I dare who am but dust?",
  "57019": "What is a moor?",
  "57020": "What sort of hope?",
  "57021": "In how long?",
  "57022": "Twenty, do you say?",
  "57023": "Do they?",
  "57024": "Why did you get him over here, if you hate him so?",
  "57025": "And who may have been the foundress of this sect?",
  "57026": "But why, why won't she see me again?",
  "57027": "Would you actually believe that you had committed your foolish acts in order to spare your son from committing them too?",
  "57028": "Is he no more graced amongst them then, say you?",
  "57029": "Why did you not carry them away with your forks and spoons?",
  "57030": "Why did they allow the ordinance to go into effect?",
  "57031": "Have you no letter for him?",
  "57032": "What, do you excuse him?",
  "57033": "It wouldn't be half so interesting if we know all about everything, would it?",
  "57034": "What was her reply?",
  "57035": "Is not this indirectly to deny women reason?",
  "57036": "Why should you always be DOING?",
  "57037": "Can it be?",
  "57038": "Who of the five appointed is to write the district address?",
  "57039": "But who can have told you so?",
  "57040": "But why should it?",
  "57041": "And you are satisfied?",
  "57042": "What else was there to be done?",
  "57043": "What on earth does she mean by it?",
  "57044": "Who knoweth the mysteries of the will, with its vigor?",
  "57045": "Right behind?",
  "57046": "If they find him?",
  "57047": "Did you notice how fearfully disturbed she was, and how red she got when she came in and found us talking?",
  "57048": "What music?",
  "57049": "May I go also, and take for you the bundles?",
  "57050": "Want me?",
  "57051": "You're sure you didn't?",
  "57052": "Our dearest, truest, kindest friend and protector?",
  "57053": "What in thunder do you fellows mean by clappin' the law on the town when all decent men are at sea this way?",
  "57054": "Who's that singing?",
  "57055": "Are you what is called a happy man?",
  "57056": "Or do you think you have?",
  "57057": "What is all this about?",
  "57058": "What on airth are you drivin at?",
  "57059": "Eh, your excellency?",
  "57060": "Your valise is then empty?",
  "57061": "Afterwards I was horribly frightened and could not help going away, for if the police had found us, what would have happened to us then?",
  "57062": "Where they are playing?",
  "57063": "But what about me?",
  "57064": "Where did they all live?",
  "57065": "But what is the next step?",
  "57066": "May this fairly be called egoistic doctrine?",
  "57067": "And if you had known that I was coming today, why be so irritated about it?",
  "57068": "Did I read it badly?",
  "57069": "Any ladies on your deck?",
  "57070": "But that was a fortnight ago, wasn't it?",
  "57071": "Do you disapprove?",
  "57072": "How shall we get home?",
  "57073": "Do you think I'm deaf?",
  "57074": "At the store of one dealer and a duty of but five at another's?",
  "57075": "What are you doing there, you limb?",
  "57076": "Am I called on to find reasons?",
  "57077": "Ye love tragedies and all that breaketh the heart?",
  "57078": "No motives but motives of sheer patriotism?",
  "57079": "Will you enter my service?",
  "57080": "Did you ever see this little trick?",
  "57081": "What do they intend doing?",
  "57082": "Know at least something?",
  "57083": "And what did you think of this fine story, eavesdropper?",
  "57084": "And when do you think we will arrive?",
  "57085": "But has he any enemies?",
  "57086": "What was the good?",
  "57087": "Who will take care of them?",
  "57088": "And did none of ye see it before?",
  "57089": "How much longer would they last?",
  "57090": "Will you give me a good character with my month's notice?",
  "57091": "Free?",
  "57092": "This you?",
  "57093": "Isn't that the idea?",
  "57094": "Why aren't you serving your country?",
  "57095": "But what were they doing in the winter, then?",
  "57096": "Have they annoyed you further?",
  "57097": "As I can't do it myself, will you kindly ring the bell?",
  "57098": "Wilson?",
  "57099": "By the way, what use are our damned icebreakers?",

  "57106": "Would he pay it?",
  "57107": "You've not come here for to make me suppose that he wants to marry HER?",
  "57108": "What has happened to vex you so?",
  "57109": "But who is it that has played us this cool trick?",
  "57110": "What think you I ought to do?",
  "57111": "Now, then, where are we to find our savage?",
  "57112": "How can you think of such a thing, in this snow?",
  "57113": "Incomplete?",
  "57114": "Then why has he not indicated the book?",
  "57115": "What, at the worst, for that matter, could she be conceived to have in her head?",
  "57116": "My son, what word has passed thy lips?",
  "57117": "You accept, however?",
  "57118": "You nearly mastered the first elements of science, didn't you?",

  "57121": "Is the count shooting in the gallery?",
  "57122": "Is it not immediately and intuitively evident that COMPETITION DESTROYS COMPETITION?",
  "57123": "Shall they be permitted to keep back settlers from more or less civilized and densely populated countries?",
  "57124": "How can you be so certain?",
  "57125": "Well, don't you think it unfair the way everything is arranged for the day creatures?",
  "57126": "Are you waiting for him for your gentlemen's dinner?",
  "57127": "Saved, isn't he?",
  "57128": "Baldwin?",
  "57129": "Or is it all but a dream?",
  "57130": "But what do you tell me that for?",
  "57131": "A lover evidently, for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you?",
  "57132": "Does medical jurisprudence provide nothing against these infringements?",
  "57133": "Now tell me who is the strongest of all?",
  "57134": "Don't you understand that from the day I loved you everything has changed for me?",
  "57135": "I wonder if they'll catch the fellow?",
  "57136": "Anything out of the common?",
  "57137": "Well, why don't they sit down?",
  "57138": "Have I not suffered enough, that you seek to increase my misery?",
  "57139": "Is it possible that the truth of life has been revealed to me only to show me that I have spent my life in falsity?",
  "57140": "Whatever you and I might say about it would make no difference, would it?",
  "57141": "Who said that?",
  "57142": "More shameful debts and extravagance?",
  "57143": "Is it so, my dear?",
  "57144": "Do you suppose I am going to take a whole host to help me?",
  "57145": "But I mean how much should you want if we stayed in this house?",
  "57146": "Captain, is this a time to snore, when we are going to be robbed?",
  "57147": "Is there anything in it or no?",
  "57148": "I hope, sir, a conversation begun with a compliment to my good sense, won't end with a sneer at my understanding?",
  "57149": "And no advice for me?",
  "57150": "Was that the work of an abolitionist?",
  "57151": "Could it be necessary that any emissary from a lawyer's office should be sent after his daughter?",

  "57180": "Who, however, could take THY melancholy off thy shoulders?",
  "57181": "Would such a gentle animal be guilty of eating a fellow creature?",
  "57182": "What are we to do now, sir?",
  "57183": "And what did you tell him?",
  "57184": "And what does it mean to me, after all?",
  "57185": "D'you s'pose they know?",
  "57186": "Know the way?",
  "57187": "Do not I know how soon it is coming?",
  "57188": "To whom is it addressed?",
  "57189": "What else then would you say?",
  "57190": "And may I ask his name?",
  "57191": "It was the hand of him that loved her best, the hand that of all she would herself have chosen, had it been to her to choose?",
  "57192": "Why didn't you come out and say so?",
  "57193": "Did he have any money, this boating man?",
  "57194": "How had it originated?",
  "57195": "But since then, when we were dragged out of the route, why did you not speak?",
  "57196": "Three hundred livres?",
  "57197": "Could he have written this under the idea that the soul is a harmony of the body?",
  "57198": "Pleasantly?",
  "57199": "Does heredity explain such cases?",
  "57200": "May not a rag be forgotten?",
  "57201": "Was it?",
  "57202": "Have you often observed that door open?",
  "57203": "Said I not that I loved you?",
  "57204": "Does he really think so?",
  "57205": "You would like some hot water, wouldn't you?",
  "57206": "What do yer talk about such things for?",
  "57207": "What do you wish, then?",
  "57208": "In a word, should he be the sinister mute of destiny beside these two happy beings?",
  "57209": "Bombay?",
  "57210": "Since you appear to know so many things, can you tell me what is become of that woman?",
  "57211": "You don't mean?",
  "57212": "He has not done it very badly, has he?",
  "57213": "What could have become of that money?",
  "57214": "What occurred in the middle ages?",
  "57215": "That will be your married look, sir, I suppose?",

  "57217": "Didn't he kick with right good will?",
  "57218": "Blister we not for bursati?",
  "57219": "What say you to that, my friends?",
  "57220": "But can you sing standing on your head, with a top spinning on your left foot, and a sabre balanced on your right?",
  "57221": "Ah, well, what were you doing there in your room all by yourself?",
  "57222": "And how should it not be hopeless?",
  "57223": "Was there any romance, anything secret or mysterious, about the wedding?",
  "57224": "O death, where is thy sting?",

  "57228": "I should have to work, perhaps?",
  "57229": "To cling fast to it, or to let go his hold?",
  "57230": "Why should you crawl abject before the understanding of a flea?",
  "57231": "And will you engage not to do any harm to the sentry, except as a last resort?",
  "57232": "Will you come in and have some supper?",
  "57233": "Et it?",

  "58668": "But by that time the epic was decadent and dying?",
  "58669": "What shall I say more?",
  "58670": "How does it taste?",
  "58671": "And if they should altogether praise me, how could I go to sleep on THEIR praise?",
  "58672": "Have you any notion of self or substance?",
  "58673": "Is it very bad?",
  "58674": "Remember?",

  "58721": "Horatio?",
  "58722": "But whats the cause that you concealde me since?",
  "58723": "How then is it possible, that the same substance can at once be modifyed into that square table, and into this round one?",
  "58724": "What have you come for?",
  "58725": "In what?",
  "58726": "A change so shameful, say, what cause has wrought?",

  "58874": "What is your judgment?",
  "58875": "Tomorrow tidings may come that the house which issued them has stopt payment, and what do they represent then?",
  "58876": "I expect there was fighting?",
  "58877": "We demand at once, and very naturally, why?",
  "58878": "How can a woman be unhappy who has only been married eight weeks to a man she chose freely?",
  "58879": "Do I know it?",
  "58880": "And how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I have shown among them?",
  "58881": "In whose house?",
  "58882": "What fruit do they eat?",
  "58883": "Heard?",
  "58884": "Where would the chances of conflicting attractions have drawn it to?",
  "58885": "Arguing?",
  "58886": "Maybe you think him too positive?",
  "58887": "How much do you know?",
  "58888": "How now, my lord?",
  "58889": "Is madame at home or not?",
  "58890": "I am free, then, sir?",
  "58891": "Why such reckless extravagance in one so young?",
  "58892": "She is a good musician too?",
  "58893": "You had no pity for that youthfulness, that beauty, that weakness?",
  "58894": "When we have knowledge, don't we lose everything but knowledge?",
  "58895": "Piccadilly?",
  "58896": "I will buy it of you, what could be better?",
  "58897": "How can you sit at your drawing such a day as this?",
  "58898": "And by what?",
  "58899": "Is it come to that?",
  "58900": "Had he not everything which girls do love?",
  "58901": "So you want me to speak to him?",
  "58902": "And when will you call?",
  "58903": "An important island?",
  "58904": "Ought I to go to him to bring a disgrace upon all the family, just because he is so good that he asks me?",
  "58905": "Seriously, I'm not annoying you, am I?",
  "58906": "She oughtn't to be thinking about spending her money on theatres already, do you think?",
  "58907": "What is this cross they are both learning to kiss, and holding up between them?",
  "58908": "And why a coxcomb?",
  "58909": "Is it not the latter's mirror, reflection, echo, an abyss which is concentric with another abyss?",
  "58910": "Have you ever seen a foot like that?",
  "58911": "What is here?",
  "58912": "Has she then a heart for music?",
  "58913": "Can you doubt my equity?",
  "58914": "And she does not condescend to bargain, while I DO, eh?",
  "58915": "Jane, will you marry me?",
  "58916": "What will you be when you are forty?",
  "58917": "Where's your house?",
  "58918": "But, at least, you will be there?",
  "58919": "Think you not then that brains, like yoked cattle, should be put to this leviathan, to make him at all budge to any landsman's imagination?",
  "58920": "Could nothing be done to induce the company to withdraw them?",
  "58921": "Whereabouts downstairs?",
  "58922": "Have I ever been acquainted with you in my youth?",
  "58923": "What's that horrible noise?",
  "58924": "Before I kiss my own darling?",
  "58925": "What's to be done now, brother?",
  "58926": "Ain't I what?",
  "58927": "What madness now possessed me?",
  "58928": "I believe he had suffered a long time?",
  "58929": "And now why are you here?",
  "58930": "Ratafia, fool?",
  "58931": "Does it rain?",
  "58932": "If you have, how can you keep away from me?",
  "58933": "You will remember what I said?",
  "58934": "But the boat?",
  "58935": "You were not certain my child was dead, and you buried it?",
  "58936": "What does it matter to you?",
  "58937": "What is the amount of truth that springs from your laws, and what amount of justice springs from your tribunals?",
  "58938": "O wheres the author of this endles woe?",
  "58939": "But pray what did he say, when I was gone?",
  "58940": "Having found so many good people in my youth, why do I find so few in my age?",
  "58941": "It will be such a delicate compliment, don't you think?",
  "58942": "You only intend, then, to dispose of that part of your fortune which the law allows you to subtract from the inheritance of your son?",
  "58943": "There remains one louis, does there not, master hotelier?",
  "58944": "And the fault of the parents on whom?",
  "58945": "You are alone?",
  "58946": "Did this hatred still seek for vengeance?",
  "58947": "That night when it snew so hard?",
  "58948": "Do my countrymen need any assurance that such a catastrophe is not to overtake them while I possess the power to stay it?",
  "58949": "And why do I ask you?",
  "58950": "And what do you think of it?",
  "58951": "Am I to drive you to the entrance?",
  "58952": "How has he accomplished this?",
  "58953": "That was good of me, wasn't it?",
  "58954": "What were you doing, sir, up in that billiard saloon?",
  "58955": "Shall I see after the carriage?",
  "58956": "To hang me out for the scorn of all my acquaintance?",
  "58957": "What would have happened if she had not lost that necklace?",
  "58958": "But since he admits, that all their property may be increased fivefold, why should he not allow the same increase to the country?",
  "58959": "Wherefore all these ceaseless toilings?",
  "58960": "If a thing is iron, then what?",
  "58961": "Did you believe that I was a deserter?",
  "58962": "And what about the maid?",
  "58963": "Her letting you see?",
  "58964": "Where to?",
  "58965": "If everyone was like your mother, how would the artist live?",
  "58966": "Why not, you rogue of a lawyer, why not?",
  "58967": "Is it not our interest, sir, to betray distrust?",
  "58968": "How can you do it?",
  "58969": "Was she unique?",
  "58970": "Why did they live at the bottom of a well?",
  "58971": "Am I hindering anyone?",
  "58972": "And what about men?",
  "58973": "How have you done all this week?",
  "58974": "Has it ever happened to you?",
  "58975": "What with him?",
  "58976": "And wherefore was it glorious?",
  "58977": "Is it likely to be more terrifying than my captivity has been sad and gloomy?",
  "58978": "His name?",
  "58979": "Anything new at the office?",
  "58980": "Lay hold on me, sir, for what?",
  "58981": "Was there any use?",
  "58982": "To get married?",
  "58983": "On what ground, we ask, is the proprietor entitled to this rent?",
  "58984": "Where does it lead to?",
  "58985": "And do you take the oldest or the youngest, or only those of ripe age?",
  "58986": "Won't you go now?",
  "58987": "But I want to know where from?",
  "58988": "You are not dreaming of it, are you?",
  "58989": "Who's somebody?",
  "58990": "That is your opinion, is it not?",
  "58991": "Then what do you suggest that we do?",
  "58992": "Could any amount of immorality have placed him in a much worse one?",
  "58993": "Do you see that there is a way in which you could make them all yourself?",
  "58994": "You were one of my pupils, you say?",
  "58995": "Do they teach you to hate me, eh?",
  "58996": "Will the reader believe it?",
  "58997": "You never find that anything goes off here accidentally, do you, my dear friend?",
  "58998": "At what hour does the examination take place?",
  "58999": "Which way did he go?",
  "59000": "Then labor is not to be paid alike?",
  "59001": "And you, queen?",
  "59002": "Is it true, or a lie?",
  "59003": "Will you both come to the shop with me?",
  "59004": "Now whither can I turn?",
  "59005": "If the dogs had scratched the sand up in excavating, how had they carried it so far?",
  "59006": "You will bring him, then?",
  "59007": "What is he, after all, they would say?",
  "59008": "Again?",
  "59009": "Isn't there any one amongst you all who can dance better than this fellow?",
  "59010": "He has not, has he?",
  "59011": "Are you in debt again?",
  "59012": "Which of them is it that you seek?",
  "59013": "Are the great old houses gaols?",
  "59014": "Did that other creature come to the same end?",
  "59015": "How much money have you?",
  "59016": "Had they conferred together?",
  "59017": "Now I am sure you can eat another breakfast?",
  "59018": "And my silliness is part of my charm?",
  "59019": "But we'll begin again, won't we?",
  "59020": "But how are you going to decide this for a nation?",
  "59021": "Archer?",
  "59022": "THAT wretched creature?",
  "59023": "Should I, who never do ill to any person, be the innocent means of doing it to my friends?",
  "59024": "What has he been doing all this time?",
  "59025": "Shall I, the queen, be able, then, to bear off no prize?",
  "59026": "Did you hear 'em shooting the cannon?",
  "59027": "Is it less than just that you should suffer as you have caused others to suffer?",
  "59028": "And what said the abbe?",
  "59029": "Would it do?",
  "59030": "Had all these houses sprung up overnight, and these streets been pushed across the meadows in a day?",
  "59031": "How was I to know?",
  "59032": "And what is the real cost of the land?",
  "59033": "Would it not be better to send him abroad at once?",
  "59034": "Do you wish it?",
  "59035": "Husband come back?",
  "59036": "Who triumphs now?",
  "59037": "And who was the lady?",
  "59038": "Why are you silent?",
  "59039": "Is it right then that the rich, the few, should have the supreme power?",
  "59040": "Where will you be safe?",
  "59041": "Do?",
  "59042": "Do I make it clear?",
  "59043": "Even hating?",
  "59044": "Are you sure, sir?",
  "59045": "Is that all you want?",
  "59046": "Well, what have you to say?",
  "59047": "How do you dare to disturb me in the exercise of my functions?",
  "59048": "But what manner of man is he, lad?",
  "59049": "What can we do to raise your spirits, dear mama?",
  "59050": "Did he do it?",
  "59051": "And the boy is dying, you say?",
  "59052": "Don't you understand how I want you for my wife?",
  "59053": "And the chariot?",
  "59054": "How long ago was it?",
  "59055": "Why do you wander so much in it yourself if you so dislike it?",
  "59056": "What in the world for?",
  "59057": "What sort of instances do you mean?",
  "59058": "Why tarry we?",

  "59061": "Who was that came in?",
  "59062": "Do you mean that he has deserted his daughter?",
  "59063": "What movement was ever spontaneous in any true sense of the word?",
  "59064": "Who has not an ass's ears?",
  "59065": "Ah, if only he would have made this demand of her?",
  "59066": "What is your name, then?",
  "59067": "Sixteen leagues?",
  "59068": "Are the lads asleep?",
  "59069": "Why, child?",
  "59070": "And can all this be true, think you?",
  "59071": "Would not one say he was speaking of a religious community?",
  "59072": "Were they permitted to indulge these cannibal propensities at the expense, not of the flocks, but of the shepherds of the provinces?",
  "59073": "Why, whatever is the matter, my dearest?",
  "59074": "What else could she spect on him?",
  "59075": "How can it be otherwise?",
  "59076": "Where is my wife?",
  "59077": "What have ye, brothers?",
  "59078": "Come, it is worth thinking about?",
  "59079": "Did I?",
  "59080": "How does he expect us to work for him if he won't stump up?",
  "59081": "What, in the name of peace, do you mean?",
  "59082": "Jane, will you have a flower?",
  "59083": "Now, then, what do you want?",
  "59084": "Shall we go and sit outside on the terrace?",
  "59085": "What is the evidence he produces?",
  "59086": "CAN anyone be unhappy, really?",
  "59087": "Whither does that way go?",
  "59088": "Come now, will you answer?",
  "59089": "But, monsieur, how can I thank you for the great kindness you have done me?",
  "59090": "How much do you expect to be paid, sir, for this picture of my girl?",
  "59091": "Are you guilty, or not guilty?",
  "59092": "Who is th' other four?",
  "59093": "Outside the pale of that holy thing, justice, by what right does one form of man despise another?",
  "59094": "Moved again?",
  "59095": "Had she understood?",
  "59096": "How would you have had it?",
  "59097": "How long is it since I went down?",
  "59098": "You know me, then?",
  "59099": "What is the cost, sir?",
  "59100": "Have I ever refused my duty, sir?",
  "59101": "What do I here seek?",
  "59102": "You cannot then confide in the nature of my wishes?",
  "59103": "Would you have had me, sir?",
  "59104": "Did you make my gruel?",
  "59105": "Why don't your juries hang murderers?",
  "59106": "I helped her to escape?",
  "59107": "And the anticipations of future pleasures and pains are of a like nature?",
  "59108": "Is there anything in the character of the accused persons which makes the accusation probable?",
  "59109": "Didn't I take up his name a dozen times in the last month?",
  "59110": "Can you recollect all that?",
  "59111": "And why cannot I reconcile myself to the prospect of death?",
  "59112": "Can he stand that ordeal?",
  "59113": "And where is this signature?",
  "59114": "And your reason?",
  "59115": "As an adventuress, or by chance meetings?",
  "59116": "Well, how about the little jaunt?",
  "59117": "What's to prevent our having a person that we CAN depend upon, and enjoying the delight of doing a good action at the same time?",
  "59118": "Really, then?",
  "59119": "Practise meditation?",
  "59120": "If you'll forgive my leaving you now?",
  "59121": "Could you have a motive for the trust, that was not honourable and flattering to me?",
  "59122": "How could springs break through such walls as these?",
  "59123": "No, why disturb the old fellow?",
  "59124": "Why shouldn't I go?",
  "59125": "And now did it all end in those ravings of hate, and in that glazing gaze of terror?",
  "59126": "And what about the green mist?",
  "59127": "Where did you put it?",
  "59128": "Now, my friends, are any of you obtuse enough to swallow that?",
  "59129": "Do you not see those fierce young braves, who are watching to kill you?",
  "59130": "Do I perceive the whereabouts of the coach which I hear rattling by my window, or does reasoning play its part in giving me information?",
  "59131": "What would it matter if everybody knew it?",
  "59132": "How shall we find his where, and having found it, how can we destroy?",
  "59133": "Now stop quietly where you are, will you?",
  "59134": "Touchin, isn't it?",
  "59135": "Who will go with you?",
  "59136": "What was I asaying?",
  "59137": "Well, a cup of coffee, my friend?",
  "59138": "Didn't I tell you the truth now, when I said you were in love?",
  "59139": "Had she never asked the gardeners?",
  "59140": "What flowed from the first?",
  "59141": "And for how long?",
  "59142": "It's a pretty sort of thing that I should have to feed a great fellow like you, and never hope to get one penny for it, isn't it?",
  "59143": "May I ask those who have not differed with me to join with me in this same spirit towards those who have?",
  "59144": "What if I don't?",
  "59145": "Frank's position?",
  "59146": "Is this the worst fate you can think of for me?",
  "59147": "Are the other effigies, which are burned in the spring and midsummer bonfires, susceptible of the same explanation?",
  "59148": "Was it right to kiss his mother or wrong to kiss his mother?",
  "59149": "Whose, then?",
  "59150": "Suppose I say to a man, how much?",
  "59151": "Do you imagine that all those who came to flatter me were sincere?",
  "59152": "Can't you mend them?",
  "59153": "What is holding one's breath?",
  "59154": "I trust, monsieur, you come authorized to treat for the surrender of the place?",
  "59155": "And which are the soft or drinking harmonies?",
  "59156": "And have a highly respectable reference for everything, have you?",
  "59157": "Have you succeeded?",
  "59158": "My hay to supply all the farmers in the district?",
  "59159": "Why do you not take your chance and be arrested with me?",
  "59160": "What was his life?",
  "59161": "Why can't I go?",
  "59162": "What generally?",
  "59163": "Shall the despair of success make me assert, that I am here possest of an idea, which is not preceded by any similar impression?",
  "59164": "But wherefore all this labour, all this strife?",
  "59165": "It is rather, isn't it?",
  "59166": "What is this folly?",
  "59167": "And after that?",
  "59168": "Did he, my dear?",
  "59169": "Man or woman, pray, sir?",
  "59170": "Brackish or salt?",
  "59171": "Who is come?",
  "59172": "But the beasts are better than the people, and why should they not have all the good things the people have?",
  "59173": "So you're not angry with me?",
  "59174": "Who are they?",
  "59175": "Had she not seen at a glance that his love tirade was worthy of ridicule, and of no other notice?",
  "59176": "Here, sire?",
  "59177": "How is your little affair coming along?",
  "59178": "Now, is it?",
  "59179": "When the eve is cool?",
  "59180": "Had I first sought after his mistress?",
  "59181": "He would not take them?",
  "59182": "What talk is this?",
  "59183": "And, if the moon is lighter than the other elements why is it opaque and not transparent?",
  "59184": "But you don't mean to say you would insist on my waiting months for the sake of clothes?",
  "59185": "Do you permit us to open this casket?",
  "59186": "Will you refuse me?",
  "59187": "What do you call this or that?",
  "59188": "Me?",
  "59189": "What was your opinion, monsieur?",
  "59190": "Is it agreed?",
  "59191": "What is to be expected of, or by, such profligates?",
  "59192": "Are ye going to let that rascal beat ye?",
  "59193": "What are you in a fright about now?",
  "59194": "Why, hain't you been talking about my coming back, and all that stuff, as if I'd been gone away?",
  "59195": "Is it not best for it to do so?",
  "59196": "When does the porter open that door?",
  "59197": "The government's?",
  "59198": "Who do you mean?",
  "59199": "Say, sir?",
  "59200": "Shall it be in here, or out on the grass?",
  "59201": "Impossible?",
  "59202": "And isn't there marvellous scenery?",
  "59203": "Is that your name?",
  "59204": "Was there nothing to identify this man?",
  "59205": "Have you kitchens here?",
  "59206": "Me?",
  "59207": "What was I saying?",
  "59208": "Yes, what about them?",
  "59209": "How do you expect me to find any if I hide in the woods?",
  "59210": "What did he say in his last hours?",
  "59211": "Of what materials can that heart be composed, which can melt when insulted, and instead of revolting at injustice, kiss the rod?",
  "59212": "Who was her mother?",
  "59213": "Heard what?",
  "59214": "May I ask you to be so good as to leave this room?",
  "59215": "What do you see in her out of the way?",
  "59216": "Do you mean to insinuate I've got toes, you unnatural wretch?",
  "59217": "Do you yet doubt?",
  "59218": "Shall I give you an illustration?",
  "59219": "And have you those excellent receipts, madam, to keep yourselves from bearing of children?",
  "59220": "But how is there a session before the recent election returns are in?",
  "59221": "Well, what are you standing there for, you sca'cwow?",
  "59222": "It has more than one, then, miss?",
  "59223": "Much more, how comprehend his face, when face he has none?",
  "59224": "Well, and your wife?",
  "59225": "What desperate debt are you thinking of?",
  "59226": "What shall be the measure of retribution?",
  "59227": "Was it you answered me?",
  "59228": "Can it be sin to know?",
  "59229": "And that I there met with a very lucky chance?",
  "59230": "And you veiled it?",
  "59231": "That's another way of fighting, I suppose?",
  "59232": "But the writing?",
  "59233": "Of course, sir, you will begin soon to educate your son yourself?",
  "59234": "Did you observe any thing peculiar about it?",
  "59235": "If the act is not repealed, what do you think will be the consequences?",
  "59236": "Is it too late?",
  "59237": "Is it true?",
  "59238": "Would you deal lighter blows rather than heavier ones?",
  "59239": "Will you allow me to live there with them?",
  "59240": "What can you possibly want to know of circuses then?",
  "59241": "Have you got through all your work?",
  "59242": "And now will this attempt, unprecedented in the annals of travels, lead to any practical result?",
  "59243": "What portion awaited those enemies?",
  "59244": "But where is my court?",
  "59245": "Whence?",
  "59246": "With what intention?",
  "59247": "He'll simply, he'll insistently have lied?",
  "59248": "What does he want to advertise for?",
  "59249": "Has he been here since?",
  "59250": "But who may abide the day of his appearing?",
  "59251": "In falsetto?",
  "59252": "Will the best of those we bade come hither to this land?",
  "59253": "Think I'm afraid of such as you?",
  "59254": "But you, gentlemen, then, have never heard the catastrophe of the BRITANNIA, mentioned?",
  "59255": "Yes?",
  "59256": "Are you dying for him?",
  "59257": "You are not so bewitched, ma'am, are you, as to remain with him of your own accord?",
  "59258": "Did it lie in some tangled depth of philosophy?",
  "59259": "Who said that?",
  "59260": "In what place, sir?",
  "59261": "Will you not embrace it?",
  "59262": "Can you tell me where I could get employment of any kind?",
  "59263": "But what is temptation?",
  "59264": "Would you put tricks upon travellers?",
  "59265": "Do not you love him, madam?",

  "59663": "How could she refuse him just because he was about thirty pounds overweight?",
  "59664": "Who did you say it was?",
  "59665": "And could we go farther than to the moon if we wanted to?",
  "59666": "Ferdishenko has gone, you say?",
  "59667": "How's your discussion society getting on?",
  "59668": "What mean the prayers and mysterious fasts you have ordered?",
  "59669": "Are you apprehensive of the new sphere you are about to enter?",
  "59670": "Well, are you satisfied?",
  "59671": "Are you going to him?",
  "59672": "Is it rational?",
  "59673": "Who did that?",
  "59674": "Have you REALLY?",
  "59675": "Can you repair this wheel immediately?",
  "59676": "Because it has a particular quality which no other has?",
  "59677": "Why would she have me killed?",
  "59678": "Come where?",
  "59679": "Hitched to a cabriolet?",
  "59680": "Do they believe that at each supposed act of creation one individual or many were produced?",
  "59681": "What were we going to do?",
  "59682": "Had his wife a private fortune?",
  "59683": "And the government is the ruling power in each state?",
  "59684": "You don't?",
  "59685": "Are you always in the country?",
  "59686": "And we are going to wait too?",
  "59687": "Are we, sure 'nough?",
  "59688": "Why was it driving at a walk?",
  "59689": "Have you ever had occasion to study character in handwriting?",
  "59690": "Where's that robin as is callin' us?",
  "59691": "Of whom are you speaking?",
  "59692": "The difficulty of my enjoyment of that is, don't you see?",
  "59693": "But you said you had no commission from her?",
  "59694": "Would you like me to send her there?",
  "59695": "And is it that liquid that is going to blow up our rocks?",
  "59696": "Do you take?",
  "59697": "And what is the difficulty now?",
  "59698": "By the way what about the political rights of these folk under your schemes?",
  "59699": "And what do you intend to do?",
  "59700": "So the rascal ran off, eh?",
  "59701": "Where is the foundling's father hidden?",
  "59702": "Talk?",
  "59703": "Ah, she has been injured then?",
  "59704": "How are you getting along?",
  "59705": "But if so, why do you degrade yourself to serve this dirty foreigner, when you at least saw the last of a genuine national gentry?",
  "59706": "Did no one hear him move?",
  "59707": "Do you hear me, sir?",
  "59708": "What are you plotting against me?",
  "59709": "Are we surprised that a multitude of proselytes should embrace the doctrine and the passions of an eloquent fanatic?",
  "59710": "Now, did you ever hear the like since you were born?",
  "59711": "What court?",
  "59712": "But what can be done about it?",
  "59713": "Has not the experience of centuries confirmed his opinion?",
  "59714": "And now that you understand the situation, what do you advise me to do?",
  "59715": "What is sadder than a dead house, with its skeleton standing bare and sinister?",
  "59716": "Besides, what trouble is there at all in doing this?",
  "59717": "Is it a job, or a boy at marbles?",
  "59718": "You found it?",
  "59719": "There are tints in the clouds this evening, violets and blues, which are very beautiful, are they not, my friend?",
  "59720": "To lie 'for' her?",
  "59721": "But such being the case, why should she take on herself to cater for the amusement of people of such degraded tastes?",
  "59722": "You remember the place, my father?",
  "59723": "Who has?",
  "59724": "A fish of the sea or river?",
  "59725": "Was the island still inhabited by the castaway to whose succor they had come?",
  "59726": "Well, sir?",
  "59727": "Why, what is the meaning of such desperate passions?",
  "59728": "Ah, why indeed?",
  "59729": "There are so many paths leading to heaven, who knows which is the right one?",
  "59730": "Can human nature be constructed on lines so insignificant?",
  "59731": "And after all, what harm does it do?",
  "59732": "Troop?",
  "59733": "Why should she answer any such question?",
  "59734": "And is the reason known?",
  "59735": "Why can't the woman leave us alone?",
  "59736": "But if she does, what can I say to her?",
  "59737": "How, master?",
  "59738": "I suppose you have your composition all done?",
  "59739": "And are we come to that degree of misery, that our enemies themselves are expected to pity us?",
  "59740": "What did he do after he had wept?",
  "59741": "'If' you've been mistaken, you say?",
  "59742": "Isn't it good?",
  "59743": "And what should I do with these?",
  "59744": "When do you think he ever told her that before?",
  "59745": "Would you come round with me to the registry office?",
  "59746": "But who are these strangers with you?",
  "59747": "And why is he doing this to me?",
  "59748": "Why, what age do you call that little creature?",
  "59749": "What sort of a new life can you and I look forward to?",
  "59750": "Why didn't you go down yesterday?",
  "59751": "Missis has got dem bills?",
  "59752": "What's that after his name?",
  "59753": "What are you laughing at?",
  "59754": "First, will your ladyship allow me to ask you whether you have had any strange visitors this morning?",
  "59755": "But who will assert, that this is the only foundation of justice?",
  "59756": "Is it far off?",
  "59757": "Are you less cold now?",
  "59758": "How many steps have you told?",
  "59759": "Is it the form of the thing?",
  "59760": "Do the buyers pay before they bring away the things?",
  "59761": "How, my fault?",
  "59762": "Where did ye get your finishing, my dear?",
  "59763": "And the meal?",
  "59764": "What have I done, that I should be the only mark of your cruelty?",
  "59765": "Was there no one in the churchyard?",
  "59766": "Well, what would she have now?",
  "59767": "What trick is this?",
  "59768": "Are the guns ready?",
  "59769": "Will you be so good as to pledge me, sir?",
  "59770": "With her?",
  "59771": "Where is the key you speak of?",
  "59772": "But where are the antennæ you spoke of?",
  "59773": "When did you come back?",
  "59774": "Not an ill wind, I hope?",
  "59775": "Eustacia?",
  "59776": "As you truly say, if we were to act in this way, what would the world come to?",
  "59777": "Oh, where shall we meet?",
  "59778": "Well, have you sent?",
  "59779": "Or why should it be forbidden that he gaze upon the sea?",
  "59780": "If I had one that I could and ought to have revealed, should I not have long ago divulged it?",
  "59781": "How can one say what seed of good may have been dropped into his soul, never to die?",
  "59782": "Do you preach them?",
  "59783": "Would you like to be a lovely young girl?",
  "59784": "Where should they go?",
  "59785": "Why such a terrible misfortune?",
  "59786": "What should he do about his skimming?",
  "59787": "How much did the stiff have in his bags?",
  "59788": "Why won't you tell me?",
  "59789": "You have tried to find him, then?",
  "59790": "Which side of his life did he resolve upon closing and condemning?",
  "59791": "And what is the name which the city derives from the possession of this sort of knowledge?",
  "59792": "What do you call him again?",
  "59793": "What about the hole?",
  "59794": "At the oars?",
  "59795": "But to whom we are to assign these studies, and in what way they are to be assigned, are questions which remain to be considered?",
  "59796": "You think I'm afraid of you and your cattle, don't you?",
  "59797": "To you?",
  "59798": "What is this leather cleaned with?",
  "59799": "Whar is you?",
  "59800": "How can people be dissatisfied with anything?",
  "59801": "What's to become of us?",
  "59802": "That I loved you?",
  "59803": "Geraldine, do you remember that still?",
  "59804": "Why does the floor seem hollowed out at this spot?",
  "59805": "Sagacious too?",
  "59806": "Well, have you anything more?",
  "59807": "What's the difference?",
  "59808": "What does it matter whether I forgive you?",
  "59809": "But, that being so, why did you offer?",
  "59810": "Better turn to, now?",
  "59811": "How can I marry her?",
  "59812": "But who will she be?",
  "59813": "Then he is there?",
  "59814": "So you DON'T think them capable of inviting a man on the condition that he is to look sharp and die?",
  "59815": "Very young or very old?",
  "59816": "Shall I then conceal the cause of my distress, and not dare to seek aid and healing for my wound?",
  "59817": "And how do you propose to prove all this?",
  "59818": "Do you doubt it, my darling?",
  "59819": "Go out?",
  "59820": "Shall I ever behold her again?",
  "59821": "What city could be at rest, lawful, and orderly?",
  "59822": "And what happened?",
  "59823": "Who is he that interrupts our busines?",
  "59824": "What is any newspaper article but an expression of the views taken by one side?",
  "59825": "But what could have been his motive for sending the cup to me?",
  "59826": "Who, then, shall come in at this day and claim that he invented it?",
  "59827": "And why are children born to such men as you?",
  "59828": "But the mystery?",
  "59829": "And that fellow with her, eh?",
  "59830": "Why should these pages be stained by further crimes?",
  "59831": "Have I ever excused her for it?",
  "59832": "And where are you going now?",
  "59833": "You are going to her, I hope?",
  "59834": "But I am curious to know are you trying to make a convert of me or a pervert of yourself?",
  "59835": "Is it not just to yourself that you should, in a few public speeches, state your reasons, and thus justify yourself?",
  "59836": "What means that haggard face, cousin, and the collar of your dress is all wet?",
  "59837": "Have you persuaded your cousin?",
  "59838": "And now could it have been otherwise?",
  "59839": "Do you expect it?",
  "59840": "The cat?",
  "59841": "Was he redeeming his promise to be good?",
  "59842": "I should like to know in what I'm your inferior?",
  "59843": "Are you quite well?",
  "59844": "Who said he was to have six pound a year?",
  "59845": "Did he ever tell you he liked you?",
  "59846": "Why should you, who have already produced so many wonderful and charming compositions, still fatigue yourself with such close application?",
  "59847": "How can you think of dirt, with such objects before you?",
  "59848": "What are you jabbering about, shipmate?",
  "59849": "But is it that I have come to the wrong house, madam?",
  "59850": "Should he rejoin the army?",
  "59851": "Would you take my advice?",
  "59852": "And I caught it, mamma, don't you remember?",
  "59853": "Has the poor lad a sister?",
  "59854": "I have come to ask if you would let me stay with you?",
  "59855": "I would only ask you now, sir, whether you have formed any explanation in your own mind as to the mysterious disappearance of your son?",
  "59856": "And you, sir?",
  "59857": "You will, of course, dispose of it in some way or other?",
  "59858": "Why should we refuse to learn from anyone?",
  "59859": "Was that grapeshot?",
  "59860": "And, now, when are we to go?",
  "59861": "Or see him prisoner, and come back to tell it?",
  "59862": "Who will be open where there is no sympathy, or has call to speak to those who never can understand?",
  "59863": "You've seen how he's been opening his mouth against us again?",
  "59864": "But why in such a hurry?",
  "59865": "Any news?",
  "59866": "Could you put me in communication with your witty and agreeable friend?",
  "59867": "But shall I tell you who this young lady is?",
  "59868": "So then they'll arrest him?",
  "59869": "What is it that you are always muttering between your teeth?",
  "59870": "Do you believe we can become one nation?",
  "59871": "What size is a big wish?",
  "59872": "Ain't you the fellow that was put in command of these men?",
  "59873": "Will you now at last speak?",
  "59874": "Isn't that a poetical name?",
  "59875": "By whom is it commanded?",
  "59876": "And how much do you suppose was really expended for improvements during that four years?",
  "59877": "In the evening?",
  "59878": "Does night lose her eyes?",
  "59879": "May I not hope to see you again?",
  "59880": "If dissolved, how could another be collected?",
  "59881": "You remember that low parapet on the roof?",
  "59882": "Why can we not fly, my friends?",
  "59883": "Was I not going to embark with forty men, and I have now reduced them to twenty for an equal success?",
  "59884": "Shall we go and sit in the cathedral?",
  "59885": "Not in his usual spirits?",
  "59886": "Are the study windows visible from there?",
  "59887": "Ye that love us, can ye move us?",
  "59888": "How should I deny aught to her that I bear in my heart?",
  "59889": "Aren't you never going to speak to me any more?",
  "59890": "There, child, what do you think of that little vase?",
  "59891": "Is he gone?",
  "59892": "Don't you think it is?",
  "59893": "And who could it be who was her confederate?",
  "59894": "What's your name, you hardened scoundrel?",
  "59895": "Why such a profound mystery?",
  "59896": "And what are we doing with our money?",
  "59897": "How d'you think I'm looking?",
  "59898": "Aint she a peart young un?",
  "59899": "Do you know this turning?",
  "59900": "What yeh goin' t' sleep in?",
  "59901": "Removal from office and perpetual disqualification?",
  "59902": "Is it accurate?",
  "59903": "Who can say?",
  "59904": "Well, what has that to do with it?",
  "59905": "Left 'em?",
  "59906": "May it not be about that cursed affair?",
  "59907": "How can it become an organic law of society?",
  "59908": "What on earth made you go there?",
  "59909": "What, too, of her wonderful and awful loveliness?",
  "59910": "The whole period of threescore years and ten is surely but a little thing in comparison with eternity?",
  "59911": "You are afraid of ghosts?",
  "59912": "Was I too much of an idiot to see the connection?",
  "59913": "But, before you go, will you, for a moment, steadily attend to me?",
  "59914": "I never knowed it by that name but what does th' name matter?",
  "59915": "Say what bring ye here?",
  "59916": "I say, would you mind coming at once?",
  "59917": "Would not love see returning penitence afar off, and fall on its neck and kiss it?",
  "59918": "What have we done to him?",
  "59919": "Pray what is your business?",
  "59920": "Whither am I now to go?",
  "59921": "Do you decline it, sir?",
  "59922": "DEAD, when?",
  "59923": "This young boarder of yours, has she tried to fly?",
  "59924": "What are we scared at and of whom are we afraid?",
  "59925": "What do you wish for?",
  "59926": "Now, policeman, what is this?",
  "59927": "Sure, what's the difference?",
  "59928": "Well, have you had a chat?",
  "59929": "Shall we go in now?",
  "59930": "Will they doubt that the philosopher is a lover of truth and being?",
  "59931": "For who is better able to direct my hesitation, or to instruct my ignorance?",
  "59932": "But why not after?",
  "59933": "Do you think you could?",
  "59934": "Who's that, then?",
  "59935": "Shall I lock the door again?",
  "59936": "Would not that dress please you?",
  "59937": "I wish to know also where you come from and to what place you are going?",
  "59938": "What do you say to a game of backgammon?",
  "59939": "Did you ever hitherto find me in the confraternity of the faulty?",
  "59940": "How would you set about it?",
  "59941": "What in the nation can he DO with it?",
  "59942": "Not indigenous?",
  "59943": "That's so?",
  "59944": "What else did he say?",
  "59945": "It was impossible?",
  "59946": "Shall we speak of the terms?",
  "59947": "This is the third time, and who knows what luck you may have?",
  "59948": "Now, whither went they with the cub?",
  "59949": "Is ours a lower order of people?",
  "59950": "Where WOULD it be?",
  "59951": "How many folks would eat your candy if they knew you handled it over before you washed your hands?",
  "59952": "Then will you give me an order that will enable me to see her?",
  "59953": "What do you think of it?",
  "59954": "What harm can a naked frog do us?",
  "59955": "Am I for poverty or for riches?",
  "59956": "'Bout what?",
  "59957": "Where to?",
  "59958": "By his not 'really' caring?",
  "59959": "What is there to be surprised at?",
  "59960": "Why is this nominal rank given us, at the price of substantial influence?",
  "59961": "Which way?",
  "59962": "Is there anything, in all the spheres of human knowledge, more surprising than political economy?",
  "59963": "I suppose I can come, can't I?",
  "59964": "She said that?",
  "59965": "Don't you wecollect what bad use I made of your lessons?",
  "59966": "You'll be with him as much as possible, won't you?",
  "59967": "What have I done, what have I said?",
  "59968": "You don't mind me half so much, do you?",
  "59969": "What IS a man ashamed of nowadays?",
  "59970": "And yet, how could she explain where she even got that money?",
  "59971": "How would that strike you if you read it?",
  "59972": "What am I to do with your IOU's, you cunning, unscrupulous rogue?",
  "59973": "But if the dead come not back, how do the old grow young again?",
  "59974": "To the barricade?",
  "59975": "During these days of rejoicing the girl is placed in a high seat, an exalted position, for is she not marriageable?",
  "59976": "Made under your own eyes?",
  "59977": "Do you follow me NOW?",
  "59978": "Have I not done and borne everything as well as I could?",
  "59979": "How can you ask?",
  "59980": "Can we account for instinct?",
  "59981": "Are they not very like the people one knows?",
  "59982": "Do you know my master is dying, very like, while you stand here?",
  "59983": "Where did you get it from?",
  "59984": "You were saying?",
  "59985": "Should he have had the courage to break away even from his present curacy?",
  "59986": "And what have you done?",
  "59987": "Badger?",
  "59988": "What is the matter with your hand?",
  "59989": "And if you have the right man cannot the choice of the type of management be safely left to him?",
  "59990": "Why didn't you tell him to put you ashore?",
  "59991": "You continue still on an unfriendly footing, then?",
  "59992": "If at intervals, at what times principally does it return, and by what causes is it produced?",
  "59993": "Isn't it a beauty?",
  "59994": "What do you want these for?",
  "59995": "Did you ever taste orange peel and water?",
  "59996": "And of the unjust may not the opposite be supposed?",
  "59997": "Will you promise me?",
  "59998": "You did not overhear what they said?",
  "59999": "You've brought your luggage with you, haven't you, my dear?",
  "60000": "Who can say the cause, the reason, the motive force of these cataclysms?",
  "60001": "Has anything happened here?",
  "60002": "Is she swift?",
  "60003": "Did you hear a caw?",
  "60004": "Then shall we propose this as a second branch of knowledge which our youth will study?",
  "60005": "Under these circumstances, what was to be done?",
  "60006": "I naturally inquired why he was not there too, instead of pacing the streets by himself?",
  "60007": "And if we do overtake him?",
  "60008": "Who was ever awe struck about a testator, or sang a hymn on the title to real property?",
  "60009": "Does it require many drugs?",
  "60010": "Why, what is it?",
  "60011": "And should a plant man die?",
  "60012": "Where did you pick her up?",
  "60013": "Could he be mistaken?",
  "60014": "What do you prescribe, doctor?",
  "60015": "How can I carry that awful thing out?",
  "60016": "What is the play, did you say?",
  "60017": "Have you anything to say to me, sir?",
  "60018": "How in tarnation did he get ahead of us?",
  "60019": "How has his whole illness gone?",
  "60020": "Who admitted you?",
  "60021": "That will give you courage?",
  "60022": "Have you, do you think?",
  "60023": "What sort is it, a setter?",
  "60024": "Where is, I do not say the consistency, but, the honesty of this law?",
  "60025": "And that is the only reply you make?",
  "60026": "What was THAT like?",
  "60027": "And your husband, child?",
  "60028": "You noticed nothing about it?",
  "60029": "Then we must remain in our car?",
  "60030": "Why did nature not ordain that one animal should not live by the death of another?",
  "60031": "How do you think the reg'ment 'll do?",
  "60032": "You mean one could smash it with a hammer?",
  "60033": "But why did they not execute those maneuvers?",
  "60034": "Fawley?",
  "60035": "Then where has it gone?",
  "60036": "And you were?",
  "60037": "And are you well?",
  "60038": "How like you the plan, my merry men all?",
  "60039": "What, no wine?",
  "60040": "Was anarchy, then, on the point of now descending from on high?",
  "60041": "What is the matter, madame?",
  "60042": "But what are we to do?",
  "60043": "May I speak in absolute confidence?",
  "60044": "And you think she returns the feeling?",
  "60045": "How do you mean?",
  "60046": "Of angels?",
  "60047": "And how distinguish that exactly from a probability?",
  "60048": "Are you laughing in your sleeve?",
  "60049": "Is there no stream about there which you could mention as a limit?",

  "60502": "I needn't see her, need I?",
  "60503": "You are content that these two scoundrels should continue persecuting you?",
  "60504": "Hareton, if I gave you a book, would you take it now?",
  "60505": "For what matter do you summon me?",
  "60506": "And had he been living all his life receiving wages and doing no work?",
  "60507": "Or have the arts to look only after their own interests?",

  "60524": "Should everybody count for one?",
  "60525": "While, do you call it?",
  "60526": "Are you to be happy while I grovel in the intensity of my wretchedness?",
  "60527": "Had that security been found sufficient?",
  "60528": "How would you like to be told that you are fat and clumsy and probably hadn't a spark of imagination in you?",
  "60529": "And, by the way, what's your name?",
  "60530": "Said I?",
  "60531": "Who killed that man?",
  "60532": "Aren't they a musical people?",
  "60533": "And is not this involuntary deprivation caused either by theft, or force, or enchantment?",

  "60535": "Is that a bargain?",
  "60536": "Who's that at my door?",
  "60537": "Father, is that you?",
  "60538": "Will it see me safe through my journey or leave me bogged in the mire?",
  "60539": "Can I have a few words with you?",
  "60540": "Who provides you with food, education, clothes, and all the means of figuring one day with honour in the ranks of society?",
  "60541": "Is that a fact?",
  "60542": "What has become of them?",
  "60543": "Maybe you're sorry for your bargain?",
  "60544": "You are some pretty well now?",
  "60545": "But suppose the whole scheme should turn out to be a castle in the air?",
  "60546": "And am I not now dying a victim to the horror and the mystery of the wildest of all sublunary visions?",
  "60547": "Well, how is it that you don't understand him then?",
  "60548": "Which shall it be?",
  "60549": "Do you want to make an exchange?",
  "60550": "A week still?",
  "60551": "Who is the happy man?",
  "60552": "What has become of this splendid wealth?",
  "60553": "What are you aiming at?",

  "60564": "Do you not yourself think that he is innocent?",
  "60565": "When will it be?",
  "60566": "What did you expect to get by it?",
  "60567": "You are not familiar with this part of the country, are you?",
  "60568": "And now, whence had this chest come?",
  "60569": "In the meantime may I make this suggestion?",
  "60570": "What, not a word?",
  "60571": "Did you fall?",
  "60572": "Why stare at me with those eyes, eyes so like the eyes of a child?",
  "60573": "Are you walking?",
  "60574": "But what did I say?",
  "60575": "Forget it?",
  "60576": "Statement here?",

  "60587": "Was ever such a dreary, dismal, unprofitable world?",
  "60588": "Shall we often have occasion to reach those far upper belts of the atmosphere?",
  "60589": "What, were you not sure of your right, or did you hope to deceive men, and make justice an illusion?",
  "60590": "Why, was't not rare?",
  "60591": "They are coming, then?",
  "60592": "The hotel, then, is far away?",
  "60593": "Why had he never treated his sisters in this way?",
  "60594": "Who should have dictated but myself, sinner as I am?",
  "60595": "But you could guess, if you tried, couldn't you?",
  "60596": "What's his business here, and why comes he with the other rogue?",
  "60597": "Tell me, what on earth is the matter?",
  "60598": "Do we want to contemplate his munificence?",
  "60599": "None at all?",
  "60600": "Can ye obliterate from our memories those who are no more?",

  "60846": "So he won't have it?",
  "60847": "And you'll stick to it, mother?",
  "60848": "Why talk of me?",
  "60849": "But the quarter's notice?",
  "60850": "But why I had no notice of his ire?",
  "60851": "Or is one soul in the very least degree more or less, or more or less completely, a soul than another?",

  "61650": "What, then, remains?",
  "61651": "But are we not made better for the effort and sacrifice, and are not those we serve lifted up and blessed?",
  "61652": "Would she have still loved this savage warrior chieftain, dancing naked among his naked savage subjects?",
  "61653": "What ship sail home to her haven?",
  "61654": "Can't you hear?",
  "61655": "If a law is wrong how are we to make its immorality evident?",
  "61656": "You hear the charge?",
  "61657": "But what do I see?",
  "61658": "Jane, you understand what I want of you?",
  "61659": "How did feudalism end?",
  "61660": "How about the license?",
  "61661": "Price?",
  "61662": "If not, where was the man, and why did he not come back?",
  "61663": "What think you sir?",
  "61664": "For what purpose are we come here?",
  "61665": "Good faith?",
  "61666": "Oh, don't you see how much nicer it would be if it was a secret?",
  "61667": "Confess what?",
  "61668": "Is this a time to be offering pardons, or renewing the long forgotten subjects of charters and taxation?",
  "61669": "Would you care to come and dine with me?",
  "61670": "What could she have done to you?",
  "61671": "And shall we begin at once?",
  "61672": "But would you be able for it, my boy?",
  "61673": "Surprised at this emphasis, I surveyed my valet, and, perceiving a wildness in his looks, asked if he had seen his grandfather's ghost?",
  "61674": "Get it ready, will you?",
  "61675": "But you could find out?",
  "61676": "Was she pretty?",
  "61677": "Or will he say that to abolish corruption is a bad thing?",
  "61678": "And why did the body conceal itself?",
  "61679": "Jo, how could you?",
  "61680": "Don't they say as there's somebody can strip it off him?",
  "61681": "Is not all here yours?",
  "61682": "What other possible reason could there have been for her so blushing ?",
  "61683": "What made him seek this quarter of the house at an untimely season, when he should have been asleep in bed?",
  "61684": "Where can they have crossed?",
  "61685": "If such things are done in the green wood, what will be done in the dry?",
  "61686": "And whom he brought back this morning?",
  "61687": "Any references?",
  "61688": "Was not he believed to be dead?",
  "61689": "With whom are you going to fight?",
  "61690": "Then don't you despair?",
  "61691": "And why think you that will make him sad?",
  "61692": "But when will you come and see my study?",
  "61693": "My friends, why with us?",
  "61694": "What a carriage that was, and where did it come from, eh?",
  "61695": "But is that all your evidence?",
  "61696": "Why did you give him six pistoles?",
  "61697": "You deny it?",
  "61698": "How long does the incredulity with which I hear a new theory propounded continue to be a wise and salutary incredulity?",
  "61699": "Do you feel that you are a sufficiently practical man?",
  "61700": "How do you mean sad?",
  "61701": "What crime, then, have you committed?",
  "61702": "Did I tell you?",
  "61703": "Fwhat are you talkin' of?",
  "61704": "How could she, indeed?",
  "61705": "Don't you hear often?",
  "61706": "But, surely, there is some one in the world whom you love?",
  "61707": "And where is his corpse?",
  "61708": "Well, do you know what is taking place at this moment?",
  "61709": "And would you like to be here alone with her for a month?",
  "61710": "Isn't it a peacock?",
  "61711": "For instance, if you lived in the penal days?",
  "61712": "I say, what on earth's the matter?",
  "61713": "She has gone to visit friends?",
  "61714": "But why did men who were interpolating bronze corslets freely introduce bronze so seldom, if at all, as the material of greaves?",
  "61715": "And the men?",
  "61716": "Do you s'pose they would?",
  "61717": "Are you making fun of me?",
  "61718": "How could he possibly have doubted it?",
  "61719": "Who ever got a letter that was worth waiting for?",
  "61720": "What is your theory, then?",
  "61721": "You've come at last, have you?",
  "61722": "How may I tell you for what we were sunk here, when I do not know, unless it was because we were rich?",
  "61723": "But what good can one do oneself?",
  "61724": "And you're so great a favourite there, you say?",
  "61725": "Give up?",
  "61726": "Are you sure you wouldn't like some more breakfast?",
  "61727": "When shall I have you here again?",
  "61728": "If she's charming, how can she help it?",
  "61729": "And discarding all consideration of political consequences, what unspeakable personal glory there would then be to him as a man?",
  "61730": "You'll not tell, will you?",
  "61731": "How could she ever suppose such a thing?",
  "61732": "Was it the same desperate confusion, or would the ground offer better facilities?",
  "61733": "Kill that boy?",
  "61734": "Why, but will you leave him with so slight command, and infuse no more charge upon the fellow?",
  "61735": "Sherry or 'ock, sir?",
  "61736": "You have the unspeakable effrontery to stand there and admit it?",
  "61737": "True?",
  "61738": "Suppose now that by the light of the examples just offered we enquire who this imitator is?",
  "61739": "Very distant?",
  "61740": "Does his conscience ever entertain the question of his right to such subsidies?",
  "61741": "How shall I defile them?",
  "61742": "Can you strike a man to the heart and leave no mark on him?",
  "61743": "Do you know whence comes our real power?",
  "61744": "You don't suppose she could take any interest in you, do you?",
  "61745": "What's your hurry?",
  "61746": "If it be, how can that question have place, concerning the subsistence of self, under a change of substance?",
  "61747": "That?",
  "61748": "And in what light must I appear to the world?",
  "61749": "Marilla, have I really a pretty nose?",
  "61750": "On the other hand, what do we see?",
  "61751": "But what should we have been then?",
  "61752": "For are not milliners and mantuamakers reckoned the next class?",
  "61753": "She used to speak of me then?",
  "61754": "Could I ever forget?",
  "61755": "You think not, sir?",
  "61756": "Ran away with her?",
  "61757": "But do you?",
  "61758": "What sort of weather was it?",
  "61759": "And all for what?",
  "61760": "So that was the way they did it, eh?",
  "61761": "What admission?",
  "61762": "To make the people laugh?",
  "61763": "How can we get it?",
  "61764": "When shall we be governed?",
  "61765": "Does he think to reduce me by long absence?",
  "61766": "To enter in the wall?",
  "61767": "Is it important business?",
  "61768": "How dare you, sir, break it?",
  "61769": "You can think of, and remember her?",
  "61770": "Would you not sooner stay with me than with them?",
  "61771": "To whom, then?",
  "61772": "Do you fear that they might be stolen?",
  "61773": "Does she know it?",
  "61774": "What do you think of me?",
  "61775": "Who is it, and what's wanted?",
  "61776": "How it happened?",
  "61777": "What is it gives her the power to look down on everything, to be calm independently of everything?",
  "61778": "Tom, what is the matter?",
  "61779": "If upon the ocean, would any passing vessel be within hail to rescue them from their critical position?",
  "61780": "What is the use of your exertion, they would say, in accumulating wealth, which is doomed to melt away in the twinkling of an eye?",
  "61781": "But if you yourselves should be struck?",
  "61782": "Don't you see how his back is laden?",
  "61783": "Where shall the little boy ride to?",
  "61784": "And you owned up?",
  "61785": "Why did you, if you regret it?",
  "61786": "Now you know me, don't you?",
  "61787": "May I see if they have more scent than the others?",
  "61788": "To do what?",
  "61789": "Oh say, what sums that generous hand supply?",
  "61790": "You did at last?",
  "61791": "Hadn't we better go?",
  "61792": "But what must be done?",
  "61793": "Is there no wizardry within it?",
  "61794": "Davy?",
  "61795": "What position do you hold?",
  "61796": "Do you mean I'm to clean pots and pans and things?",
  "61797": "Why don't you go away with him?",
  "61798": "Is it empty?",
  "61799": "But how to get to him in safety?",
  "61800": "After all, thirty cents isn't much, eh what?",
  "61801": "Wouldn't you punish children at all, when they misbehaved?",
  "61802": "And why did he fire at us?",
  "61803": "Has he built one here, then?",
  "61804": "Will that satisfy you?",
  "61805": "Soft, who be these?",
  "61806": "What upon earth is to make them so?",
  "61807": "James's?",
  "61808": "Is your father in?",
  "61809": "Why were you treated so?",
  "61810": "And is that all, papa?",
  "61811": "Isn't that a nice imaginative name?",
  "61812": "The poorest?",
  "61813": "What's up now?",
  "61814": "You'll come out after supper, won't you?",
  "61815": "Don't you know the temptation to say frightful and shocking things just for the mere sake of saying them?",
  "61816": "You are going on a journey?",
  "61817": "You think it right, then, that your niece should throw herself in his way?",
  "61818": "Stronger then he was wont?",
  "61819": "And if you keep it under your skirts like that, who's to help tumbling?",
  "61820": "And the worthy man destroyed your compromising letter?",
  "61821": "Mary what, doctor?",
  "61822": "How can you say that, sir?",
  "61823": "Nay, why external for internal given?",
  "61824": "What would it profit a woman, for example, to get him a few months' imprisonment if her own ruin must immediately follow?",
  "61825": "What kind of people?",
  "61826": "And why did she weep so bitterly?",
  "61827": "Is this modesty?",
  "61828": "Whatever was it I was disputing about?",
  "61829": "Well now, what are you going to do about it?",
  "61830": "Indeed, who is free from them?",
  "61831": "Is this the way to the princesses' apartments?",
  "61832": "What have you been doing that you shouldn't?",
  "61833": "But why this singular vision, if the portrait is a faithful copy of the original?",
  "61834": "Tell me, if you please, what seems to cause you so much joy?",
  "61835": "But would you mind letting me hold your hand?",
  "61836": "Would he be in a position to marry?",
  "61837": "What about, sir?",
  "61838": "Then why go there?",
  "61839": "Has a crime been committed?",
  "61840": "Where should she turn for advice and counsel?",
  "61841": "Doctor, would it be proper to ask what is your secret?",
  "61842": "Do you like him any better?",
  "61843": "Was the lady crying?",
  "61844": "What's on your mind?",
  "61845": "Where are you going to?",
  "61846": "Will you make yourself known to me?",
  "61847": "There is one strange thing, do you know it?",
  "61848": "And you've not been anywhere this evening?",
  "61849": "What had she done to have deserved all this?",
  "61850": "But what about the fighting?",
  "61851": "You haven't any heart, have you?",
  "61852": "Is the fellow gone that brought this letter?",
  "61853": "What she?",
  "61854": "Tart of palate?",
  "61855": "And what made him drink?",
  "61856": "And what do you suppose it is?",
  "61857": "Why did you not come and speak to me in the room?",
  "61858": "Anthony, was it you?",
  "61859": "What I want to know is, where did he get that cheque?",
  "61860": "After dodging me for all these weeks and forcing me to climb the roof here like a tom cat and to come to see you as a doctor?",
  "61861": "Wasn't I telling you, and you a fine, handsome young fellow with a noble brow?",
  "61862": "Then to injure a friend or any one else is not the act of a just man, but of the opposite, who is the unjust?",
  "61863": "Who would say that, having come so far together, we will not go forward from here?",
  "61864": "What do you want with us?",
  "61865": "For has he not fine fences?",
  "61866": "Are they pretending?",
  "61867": "Why have I alluded to this man?",
  "61868": "Picrochole, my ancient friend of old time, of my own kindred and alliance, comes he to invade me?",
  "61869": "Does your explanation cover every point?",
  "61870": "Have you managed it?",
  "61871": "But whither?",
  "61872": "Ain't what's a man's wife's his?",
  "61873": "The verses accompanying this, may I beg you to take out of the tomb, and bring them to light in the 'Home journal?",
  "61874": "By whose authority?",
  "61875": "What will you say, then?",
  "61876": "Doen't I want you more now, than ever I did?",
  "61877": "What signifies my refusing?",
  "61878": "How could I have forgotten that?",
  "61879": "But what shall we do with the poor gentleman?",
  "61880": "And you intend to make him do it in the presence of two witnesses, do you?",
  "61881": "Will your majesty allow me one word of reply?",
  "61882": "You knew the pig?",
  "61883": "At whose hand?",
  "61884": "Why do you think that you are safer in this room than on the stage?",
  "61885": "Do you think it points to suicide?",
  "61886": "Know?",
  "61887": "Do you not know him, queen?",
  "61888": "How much?",
  "61889": "I wonder what that old man meant by his strange words?",
  "61890": "Did you see that woman who went by just now?",
  "61891": "It's not a matter of principle, but why should I go?",
  "61892": "How could I escape through these mighty walls?",
  "61893": "Are you in earnest or no?",
  "61894": "Would he ever live until then, with his strength ebbing away?",
  "61895": "Haf you got a new light for my cigar?",
  "61896": "Do you think that you could perform one more feat?",
  "61897": "What have been the results of your quarrel?",
  "61898": "How could it be?",
  "61899": "Then the superhuman and divine is absolutely incapable of falsehood?",
  "61900": "Are there no such things as pewter forks and spoons?",
  "61901": "Well, you know it's burned, so what's the use of talking?",
  "61902": "Don't I tell you he's provincial of the order now?",
  "61903": "Club?",
  "61904": "Does not this stream at our feet run toward the summer, until its waters grow salt, and the current flows upward?",
  "61905": "Is that my case?",
  "61906": "And you allowed it?",
  "61907": "For his own sake?",
  "61908": "And what are those studies, if I may presume to ask?",
  "61909": "What sort of things do YOU remember best?",
  "61910": "What does that mean?",
  "61911": "And of what did he die?",
  "61912": "Why am I always to be worried?",
  "61913": "You've seen a lot of trouble, sir, eh?",
  "61914": "How did you know it?",
  "61915": "Is that it?",
  "61916": "When shall we see each other?",
  "61917": "Why, have you got something the matter with you?",
  "61918": "Your son?",
  "61919": "What terrible step might she not take to effect her wishes?",
  "61920": "You're quite sure it's all right for you?",
  "61921": "And ought she to regard me as a friend?",
  "61922": "Where must I look?",
  "61923": "HOW'D you come?",
  "61924": "How could he get the school shopkeepers into trouble by owning that they let some of the boys go on tick with them?",
  "61925": "But how could I?",
  "61926": "What are your commands, lieutenant?",
  "61927": "Do you think he games at all?",
  "61928": "Why should I have dreaded it?",
  "61929": "After having once received the human organism, why should a soul choose to go back to the lesser and more imperfect organism of an animal?",
  "61930": "You will not go, then?",
  "61931": "Each day?",
  "61932": "Why don't you rent a furnished room and leave them in that for a week?",
  "61933": "But what is there to oblige him to reply?",
  "61934": "What have you two been doing now?",
  "61935": "Why is it you have earth that's not sifted?",
  "61936": "Why had he suggested a dinner party?",
  "61937": "But is he near at hand?",
  "61938": "Is there a man or a voman in this valley vat does not know it?",
  "61939": "What fortune?",
  "61940": "D'ye think 'twill hurt me?",
  "61941": "My soule?",
  "61942": "What could they take from me?",
  "61943": "Didn't you see anything in the corner, on the left, on the third shelf?",
  "61944": "Do you feel the earth tremble?",
  "61945": "Yet indeed, what was I to him?",
  "61946": "Have you no idea of the existence of spirits superior to either man or beast?",
  "61947": "Orpheus ?",
  "61948": "Have you lost anyone, my dear fellow?",
  "61949": "Must I go afoot?",
  "61950": "Why, is it late?",
  "61951": "And what will they burn instead of coal?",
  "61952": "What do they boil with 'em?",
  "61953": "Shall we, then, regard a hearty appetite as a curse, to be mitigated but not wholly neutralized by a series of good dinners?",
  "61954": "Know ye of it in this land?",
  "61955": "Nay, I beseech you, gentlemen, what means this?",
  "61956": "What makes my presence here so opportune?",
  "61957": "Had he bribed the agent?",
  "61958": "Do you think that I am in earnest?",
  "61959": "A marchioness?",
  "61960": "At home?",
  "61961": "Was it not so you were called when your honored brother married us?",
  "61962": "Where do you wish him to be?",
  "61963": "And that is your room up there?",
  "61964": "Where did he get his grasp upon affairs and his knowledge of men?",
  "61965": "Not violets?",
  "61966": "And how did you find him?",
  "61967": "Of the breaking up of the frozen sea in their displeasure?",
  "61968": "What are they, then, doctor?",
  "61969": "What business have you with luxuries of that kind?",
  "61970": "Isn't it a sickening FOOL ?",
  "61971": "I suppose you'll say there is nothing national about our literature either?",
  "61972": "Did he not excel in all the exercises and accomplishments proper to youth?",
  "61973": "What then will it be when it forms a judgment about anything aided by reason and deliberately?",
  "61974": "Who, my life?",
  "61975": "What would your aunt have said to it?",
  "61976": "Could he be certain that some conjuncture would not occur which would bring the mysterious personage on the scene?",
  "61977": "Surely that is all simple and obvious?",
  "61978": "What is it that drove you, impelled you, to separate yourself from the great natural path of marriage and the family?",
  "61979": "Could you tell me them, so that I can suit them to my purpose?",
  "61980": "You have nothing else to report to us before we go into this matter?",
  "61981": "So you're my nephew, are you?",
  "61982": "Has my horse had an extra feed?",
  "61983": "What, says I, have the galls been jiltin you?",

  "61991": "May I help myself again?",
  "61992": "Why did he ride away before I had time to ask him how his lord and lady do I?",
  "61993": "And do not good practices lead to virtue, and evil practices to vice?",
  "61994": "What, haven't you seen her lately?",
  "61995": "How can you say I am harsh, you naughty fondling?",
  "61996": "And you would really wish me to marry this girl?",
  "61997": "What were you doing at the moment you were arrested?",
  "61998": "Oh, what made you?",
  "61999": "Had they found the life of the body after all?",
  "62000": "Have all these, your friends, been there?",
  "62001": "How do you all do?",
  "62002": "Had he abandoned the effort, or was he continuing his journey along the route agreed upon?",
  "62003": "Aren't you thinking of giving me any?",
  "62004": "Couldn't you try to reastralize them?",
  "62005": "I never made a fool of you, did I?",
  "62006": "If he were an assassin, would I save him?",
  "62007": "Whence, and what art you?",
  "62008": "What is the matter with you this morning?",
  "62009": "Why not end it all?",
  "62010": "What'll you take for that hide?",
  "62011": "And now, uncle, tell me where we are at the present moment?",
  "62012": "What were the causes of these events?",
  "62013": "What is it, my dear vicomte?",
  "62014": "What did you print last night?",
  "62015": "But why regard it as a crime, if they are sincere?",
  "62016": "Is it a criminal case?",
  "62017": "If I'm jealous, don't you see?",
  "62018": "Now, shall I get whatever I ask for?",
  "62019": "But how do you account for the fact that neither of the bodies have been recovered?",
  "62020": "Why don't you let her head that line?",
  "62021": "You mean they've done her in?",
  "62022": "Would you believe it?",
  "62023": "Ought the public, therefore, to give no attention, it may be asked, to the education of the people ?",
  "62024": "May I look at your translation?",
  "62025": "Do you really mean that things are not so desperate after all?",
  "62026": "Where is my wife?",
  "62027": "Don't you think his hair's growing?",
  "62028": "Is the right of succession a right of accumulation or only a right of choice?",
  "62029": "Shall I, daughter of a noble sire, suffer the worst indignity?",
  "62030": "Your niece, is she?",
  "62031": "Don't you think so, d'Artagnan?",
  "62032": "Do you think it will ever be in a settled state?",
  "62033": "Quite a child, isn't she?",
  "62034": "Where was this to end?",
  "62035": "Why are you so melancholy, brother?",
  "62036": "But let me see, how was it done?",
  "62037": "To what other?",

  "62443": "Are you unbaptized?",
  "62444": "My own showing?",
  "62445": "Was I mistaken?",
  "62446": "Who will discover this wonderful something?",
  "62447": "Destroyed?",
  "62448": "Did he excavate it?",
  "62449": "And where is the speaker?",
  "62450": "How are you and he getting on with your studies?",
  "62451": "Have you learnt how to shudder yet?",
  "62452": "Will you shake hands?",
  "62453": "Now is not this too bad?",
  "62454": "Besides, who but a prig would set himself high aims, or make high resolves at all?",
  "62455": "When, how, why had this hair been shut up in this drawer?",
  "62456": "Pull, won't ye?",
  "62457": "But who would be so severe against an extemporised satirical hit, uttered perhaps by a clown?",
  "62458": "How much weighs each bag of tools?",
  "62459": "Is she a political one?",
  "62460": "Does his mother then, keep poisons in her laboratory?",
  "62461": "Am I to understand, then, that I have received no promise?",
  "62462": "Did I hinder you?",
  "62463": "Which was he to take?",
  "62464": "Who's that?",
  "62465": "Can you tell me?",
  "62466": "Or is she an elfish spirit, who, as the legends of our childhood taught us, is forbidden to cross a running stream?",
  "62467": "Why ask me?",
  "62468": "Which means?",
  "62469": "Will he agree?",
  "62470": "Will ten pounds do it, sir?",
  "62471": "Shining, is it?",
  "62472": "Can he leave the island if he likes?",
  "62473": "But how is he now?",
  "62474": "You've got five years of it, haven't you?",
  "62475": "A bird or a peacock?",
  "62476": "Speak, you old cent per cent fornicator?",
  "62477": "If it's any of my business, how the devil did you ever get into that bally jungle?",
  "62478": "Where does man come in?",
  "62479": "Should we be here now if they were brave?",
  "62480": "Sir?",
  "62481": "And what does she say, requiring consideration?",
  "62482": "Thy country?",
  "62483": "What had happened?",
  "62484": "You recognise that I don't lie or dissemble or deceive?",
  "62485": "Where is she staying?",
  "62486": "Did it spread towards other parts of the island?",
  "62487": "Wait, haven't you dropped it?",
  "62488": "The garden?",
  "62489": "Do you think it's possible?",
  "62490": "You didn't either of you say anything about other matters?",
  "62491": "I suppose they were government matches, then?",
  "62492": "You knew him?",
  "62493": "What was the fair lady's game?",
  "62494": "Is it war?",
  "62495": "You don't mean that seriously?",
  "62496": "I am still young, am I not?",
  "62497": "A great man?",
  "62498": "How did you get in if both houses were empty?",
  "62499": "Where could she be?",
  "62500": "Will you take me in your company?",
  "62501": "Isn't that so?",
  "62502": "How do you expect me to know such things?",
  "62503": "Then the just soul and the just man will live well, and the unjust man will live ill?",
  "62504": "And how does he clean the boots?",
  "62505": "Has C, a hatter, the right to force D, his neighbor and also a hatter, to close his shop, and cease his business?",
  "62506": "When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did they not lick his blood?",
  "62507": "Where do you land?",
  "62508": "And in that interval there has now been discovered something which we call opinion?",
  "62509": "Yet you cried out?",
  "62510": "Perhaps the other gentleman called, sir?",
  "62511": "Do you know what that is a warning of?",
  "62512": "Have you turned the case over in your mind?",
  "62513": "Why should I not confess it, gentlemen?",
  "62514": "Am I worse than I believe myself to be?",
  "62515": "How about moving that drugget?",
  "62516": "But you had a gun and bayonet besides?",
  "62517": "Do I sing?",
  "62518": "What do I want?",
  "62519": "What man?",
  "62520": "At good profit?",
  "62521": "Carton?",
  "62522": "And advancing?",
  "62523": "Can't we wait a few days?",
  "62524": "You are in mourning for some near relation?",
  "62525": "Do you know any who belong to the latter category?",
  "62526": "Now, what do you say about her doctor?",
  "62527": "Did your worship speak to me?",
  "62528": "Who are these people?",
  "62529": "Could it be an impartial one?",
  "62530": "What do you down here, my friend?",
  "62531": "Could he suspect my true identity?",
  "62532": "Don't know how old you are?",
  "62533": "And the women?",
  "62534": "Suppose I do not want to be happy, what is the source of the obligation?",
  "62535": "Or the generous deed out of selfishness?",
  "62536": "Were you sent here to praise me?",
  "62537": "How do you feel now, dear?",
  "62538": "She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?",
  "62539": "You know him, then?",
  "62540": "Will he always come when you call him?",
  "62541": "And what has that to do with me?",
  "62542": "Why compliment him on being a romantic reactionary aristocrat?",
  "62543": "In the first place, and before everything else, sir, is the news as bad in your opinion as I am asked to believe?",
  "62544": "But how was it that the grooms knew it?",
  "62545": "Will you appoint a meeting for six months hence?",
  "62546": "Find it easy?",
  "62547": "What is credit?",
  "62548": "Were they going over to the other side?",
  "62549": "So you will send me that book, dear count?",
  "62550": "But it's over now?",
  "62551": "Am I talking?",
  "62552": "And to what?",
  "62553": "Have I always hated you so much?",
  "62554": "How does he use it?",
  "62555": "You will sing with me?",
  "62556": "Grant?",
  "62557": "I say, you don't happen to have heard of a murder?",
  "62558": "What did I borrow?",
  "62559": "Am I not clearly designated in that, captain?",
  "62560": "And with what purpose could he do that?",
  "62561": "What is it that this polypragmonetic ardelion to all the fiends of hell doth aim at?",
  "62562": "What has happened that you should speak like that?",
  "62563": "What means, then, this dithyramb upon property?",
  "62564": "And where afterwards?",
  "62565": "What reason was there for assuming any probability of an uprising in the city?",
  "62566": "Is it not a canonical and authentic exception, worthy to be premised to all our undertakings?",
  "62567": "Ah, friends, what shall I do?",
  "62568": "Do we not both take from the poor people that which they can ill spare?",
  "62569": "What is the place, then, upon which we stand?",
  "62570": "Is he a man of fortune?",
  "62571": "How dare to repeat experiments that had failed so often?",
  "62572": "There is still another influence, what do you say to that?",
  "62573": "What makes you ask?",
  "62574": "Killed?",
  "62575": "See you not, you goblins, that your lord and master is here?",
  "62576": "Now, who can this other letter be from?",
  "62577": "But how is it he is not already returned?",
  "62578": "What is to be the manner of her death?",
  "62579": "Wizard?",
  "62580": "Then why have you endeavoured to assist him?",
  "62581": "And, conversely, that which has less of truth will also have less of essence?",
  "62582": "You mean that they would shipwreck?",
  "62583": "Didn't you yourself bring her the contract?",
  "62584": "Swinging by the chain?",
  "62585": "What put it into your head, little mother?",
  "62586": "You don't mean to say he's here?",
  "62587": "Then it is very thin wine?",
  "62588": "Did I offer to hit him or did I not?",
  "62589": "And what temperature may that be?",
  "62590": "Have you a pair of silent shoes?",
  "62591": "Who else should do so?",
  "62592": "And to what effect?",
  "62593": "I shall meet them there, and who knows what future advantages may result from the interview?",
  "62594": "Could it have been aught but a shipwreck which had drawn it under the water?",
  "62595": "The song?",
  "62596": "Shall you go?",
  "62597": "How are you, my dear?",
  "62598": "Ain't that a shame, sir?",
  "62599": "Why then not trace the rights of man to the creation of man?",
  "62600": "How did you know about it?",
  "62601": "What was the worthy geographer thinking of?",
  "62602": "How about that?",
  "62603": "Who knows it?",
  "62604": "You were alluding to the jerking movement of my hand every time I try to reach for anything?",
  "62605": "What the devil was you afraid of?",
  "62606": "What did he do before he went?",
  "62607": "Your alphabet?",
  "62608": "What's up?",
  "62609": "Which house is that?",
  "62610": "What's your real name?",
  "62611": "Why were they so strangely silent?",
  "62612": "Is it an amusing story?",
  "62613": "You were, were you not?",
  "62614": "Do you find the answer?",
  "62615": "At last she is dead?",
  "62616": "Do you mean to say you couldn't love me then?",
  "62617": "Don't you hear to what soft whispers the wind has fallen?",
  "62618": "Time to start?",
  "62619": "Wasn't it as good as a marriage?",
  "62620": "You understand?",
  "62621": "But how did you know that I was a prisoner back there?",
  "62622": "Wherein?",
  "62623": "Which do you prefer?",
  "62624": "What can be more gratifying than such a retrospect as this?",
  "62625": "What did she say?",
  "62626": "Oh, indeed?",
  "62627": "Besides, which am I to choose?",
  "62628": "Go to?",
  "62629": "But how could I, a poor dazed village lad, avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best and wisest of men fall every day?",
  "62630": "Well, why not?",
  "62631": "What does it all mean?",
  "62632": "I may assume that there is a second to be mentioned?",
  "62633": "And it's a very pretty name, don't you think?",
  "62634": "Your father is dead?",
  "62635": "Of whom?",
  "62636": "Natasha, you would not deceive me?",
  "62637": "What were you doing in the battle, my friend?",
  "62638": "But does not this expose himself more than me?",
  "62639": "And is not this the reason why of old love has been called a tyrant?",
  "62640": "What are you doing here?",
  "62641": "Why not take a number of banths and set them loose before us above ground?",
  "62642": "How long did he wear it?",
  "62643": "Is he not a prey which will always be within your grasp?",
  "62644": "What instructing do you think I should do?",
  "62645": "What took her away?",
  "62646": "Yes, how long?",
  "62647": "Is it not the separation of soul and body?",
  "62648": "It is said to have been a congestion of the brain, or apoplexy, which is the same thing, is it not?",
  "62649": "Executions?",
  "62650": "Have commissioned you to tell me what you have just stated?",
  "62651": "Remorse or regret?",
  "62652": "How am I to describe it?",
  "62653": "Tulkinghorn?",
  "62654": "Why are you smiling, prince?",
  "62655": "And if he had not, why did he take her again?",
  "62656": "That is your intention, is it not?",
  "62657": "Will it pass?",
  "62658": "Why did you pick him?",
  "62659": "Do you suppose these stoneless mounds hide no dust of what were men just as good?",
  "62660": "Where are those passionate eyes that appeal'd to my eyes in passion?",
  "62661": "What is it that you say you are going to do?",
  "62662": "What did she send?",
  "62663": "For you surely would not regard the skilled mathematician as a dialectician?",
  "62664": "Should he find him at all?",
  "62665": "Why should I meddle?",
  "62666": "The earlier it might be, would it not be better?",
  "62667": "The theories say that, do they?",
  "62668": "And what hope was there that these designs would fail?",
  "62669": "Not from the photos I have showed you?",
  "62670": "Have you ever noticed that the ones we would love the most distractedly are those whom we never meet to know?",
  "62671": "Well, then, my lord, say, are you satisfied?",
  "62672": "Gentlemen, do you stare?",
  "62673": "Well, what do you want?",
  "62674": "Why, monsieur, what secret can you expect to find in the hollow head of a soldier?",
  "62675": "Are you going to return there?",
  "62676": "What need has it of exaggeration?",
  "62677": "What if she loves you now better than anyone?",
  "62678": "Do you happen to know any one in this neighbourhood who would receive him for a while on my paying for him beforehand?",
  "62679": "He has done his best, but what does a fish's best come to when the fish is out of water?",
  "62680": "You are a reactionary, then?",
  "62681": "What's up, anyhow?",
  "62682": "Will there, indeed?",
  "62683": "Who drove you to it?",
  "62684": "We being strangers here, how dare you trust so great a charge from your own custody?",
  "62685": "You are a wheelwright?",
  "62686": "Does that suit you?",
  "62687": "Is anything the matter, aunt?",
  "62688": "But did be profess any attachment?",
  "62689": "Who are you, madame?",
  "62690": "Did you ever taste beer?",
  "62691": "Boomer?",
  "62692": "Does he mean to say that?",
  "62693": "Didn't you get my last letter?",
  "62694": "Don't you see you are not wanted here?",
  "62695": "How much fudder is got for go?",
  "62696": "I say, did you mean it the other day that you wouldn't marry me if I asked you?",
  "62697": "Is anyone up in your house?",
  "62698": "Will that suit you?",
  "62699": "Have I not explained your wishes, grandpapa?",
  "62700": "Did you see it?",
  "62701": "And, to be frank, my lord, was I wrong?",
  "62702": "From what?",
  "62703": "How was he to meet his lawyer?",
  "62704": "Herod?",
  "62705": "Cautious, why so?",
  "62706": "Was it the better to deceive them both?",
  "62707": "Why can't I?",
  "62708": "Did you tell us?",
  "62709": "Do you understand what you have done to me?",
  "62710": "Nor church?",
  "62711": "Does it end with just our two selves?",
  "62712": "Will there be beds for me and all who seek?",
  "62713": "But it's SOMEBODY'S plates, ain't it?",
  "62714": "What virtue will there be then, said the monk, in their bullets of concupiscence, their habits and their bodies?",
  "62715": "How do I know?",
  "62716": "In what direction?",
  "62717": "And of such a man too?",
  "62718": "What good am I here?",
  "62719": "Do you mean what did I say?",
  "62720": "What did the whole world matter to them?",
  "62721": "You feel some pretty well now?",
  "62722": "The man says?",
  "62723": "How should I make a mistake?",
  "62724": "Will you have hash or fishballs for breakfast?",
  "62725": "Won't you come again to see me?",
  "62726": "What signifies?",
  "62727": "Did she mean to go out?",
  "62728": "Where is she?",
  "62729": "Do you know where they came from?",
  "62730": "Did you see him come out on us?",
  "62731": "Why lie awake nights worrying about this?",
  "62732": "And if I did not obey his call, who could answer for what might happen?",
  "62733": "Or worse than the parts they acted require?",
  "62734": "What did you go out for?",
  "62735": "Well, then, what's the sense in wasting the plates?",
  "62736": "Aren't you very tired?",
  "62737": "Have you not lately renewed your promise?",
  "62738": "Whose are these beautiful green meadows?",
  "62739": "And why do we set our soul and body, which are such dear companions, at such variance?",
  "62740": "Living together?",
  "62741": "Did you never hear it?",
  "62742": "You don't remember me?",
  "62743": "And what else is paper currency?",
  "62744": "And do you propose to make this journey very shortly?",
  "62745": "But what if fresh disasters should take place?",
  "62746": "Who will say they were not beautiful?",
  "62747": "What did tha' shut thysel' up for?",
  "62748": "Is anybody to come and fetch me?",
  "62749": "But when?",
  "62750": "And what explanation is given of the girl's death?",
  "62751": "What was the dreadful thing I dreamed?",
  "62752": "I should think it was a very pleasant life, the married one, eh?",
  "62753": "But what shall we reply to the medals, undoubtedly genuine, which reckon the fifth year of his tribunitian power?",
  "62754": "Have we either of us ever rubbed thumbs over honestly gained farthings?",
  "62755": "Ah, you are the young woman come to look after my birds?",
  "62756": "There ain't nothing wrong?",
  "62757": "How can we help it?",
  "62758": "Why do you ask such a question, I said, when you ought rather to be answering?",
  "62759": "Would you say six or four years?",
  "62760": "Would you shoot a poor, defenceless girl?",
  "62761": "D'ye think he had great pain when 'a died?",
  "62762": "Which is the duke?",
  "62763": "Now, are you ready?",
  "62764": "Oh, isn't it sweet and fresh back here?",
  "62765": "Can you write shorthand?",
  "62766": "Yes, why did I not steal?",
  "62767": "Will you say it is because the body is the medium of suffering in this life?",
  "62768": "Haven't you no manners?",
  "62769": "And are who what?",
  "62770": "You are of my opinion?",
  "62771": "Could it be possible that the squire was going to make a fool of himself and get married?",
  "62772": "Funny, ain't it, that you and me both had the same idea about spending our vacation?",
  "62773": "But you will?",
  "62774": "Then why didn't you say so?",
  "62775": "How much is it?",
  "62776": "You will permit me to consider him an invalid?",
  "62777": "Where is he concealed?",
  "62778": "But was it his fault?",
  "62779": "You spoke to my coachman, then?",
  "62780": "Was the photograph a cabinet?",
  "62781": "Who's go dar?",
  "62782": "Didn't you hear us calling you?",
  "62783": "For the commission, is it not my whole future?",
  "62784": "Why all this excitement?",
  "62785": "Do you know the numbers?",
  "62786": "Do you wish you may die if you do know, hey?",
  "62787": "Why then should he repine when the hour of separation arrives?",
  "62788": "She had no reason for walking elsewhere, and why should she not go that way?",
  "62789": "Where is the knave?",
  "62790": "Any news, father?",
  "62791": "When did you see him last?",
  "62792": "Why, pray, did he add the old day?",
  "62793": "You think he went off just by chance?",
  "62794": "Is the cause of my soreness such a mystery that there's any need to tell me I am sore everywhere the staff hit me?",
  "62795": "Couldn't ye ha' said soa, at onst?",
  "62796": "What be these two, signior?",
  "62797": "Can anyone here play the drum?",
  "62798": "Shall you like to have such a brother?",
  "62799": "And what is better than woman?",
  "62800": "Ye much hurt?",
  "62801": "How shall I ever look this man in the face again?",
  "62802": "Yes?",
  "62803": "You think there may be fighting?",
  "62804": "Could it be that by some neglect in the preparations, the substitution perhaps of the wrong brandy, the astralization could not be effected?",
  "62805": "Was this to her doom after all?",
  "62806": "How agreed?",
  "62807": "And those papers?",
  "62808": "How is the gentleman called?",
  "62809": "What do you mean, you minx?",
  "62810": "What can be done?",
  "62811": "And why are we here?",
  "62812": "How do you know I can't?",
  "62813": "Amontillado ?",
  "62814": "A coffin?",
  "62815": "Does it suggest anything to your mind?",
  "62816": "Is the second floor at home?",
  "62817": "You are certain?",
  "62818": "Why, did you not hear all we said?",
  "62819": "How, how?",
  "62820": "Is this statement true?",
  "62821": "Then it is my place to ask you what you are going to do about it?",
  "62822": "Won't you come in again, and stay as long as you like?",
  "62823": "Why are you up so early, my dear?",
  "62824": "Who will tell her?",
  "62825": "Guilty, of course?",
  "62826": "Do you laugh, you unfeeling brute, as if you enjoyed my distress?",
  "62827": "What enjoyment is there in making love to a woman who belongs to nobody and yet belongs to any one?",
  "62828": "Have you not a word to say to me?",
  "62829": "Two drunken men, eh?",
  "62830": "What need they torture their heads with that which others have taken so strictly and so unalterably into their own purveying?",
  "62831": "What can be more natural and characteristic?",
  "62832": "Is there anything particular?",
  "62833": "What are you upset about?",
  "62834": "But the bogus inspector?",
  "62835": "And where are the children?",
  "62836": "There are then people who inhabit it?",
  "62837": "But where is thy son now?",
  "62838": "Her happiness?",
  "62839": "Please, ma'am, could I inquire if this highly instructive and charming institution is a new one?",
  "62840": "But why not?",
  "62841": "How would they address us?",
  "62842": "Is there any thing new in this doctrine?",
  "62843": "What was she to say to him?",
  "62844": "You doubt it then?",
  "62845": "What sort of mischief?",
  "62846": "What sense is there in murdering a man in order to define one's relation to a guilty wife and son?",
  "62847": "Then this new kind of knowledge must have an additional quality?",
  "62848": "Lads, haven't you a sack?",
  "62849": "How do you mean, bold?",
  "62850": "What farther proof can be desired for the present system?",
  "62851": "They taught you that?",
  "62852": "But you, critic, the reader undoubtedly will ask, what is your solution?",
  "62853": "But the heat developed by the rapidity of the projectile in crossing the strata of air?",
  "62854": "Of all this we may certainly affirm that we acquired the knowledge before birth?",
  "62855": "Well, are you trying to make out that I've said you have?",
  "62856": "Three days ago?",
  "62857": "What is it, a man?",
  "62858": "Whom do you think that is to?",
  "62859": "The lighted window, right up there?",
  "62860": "An' you don't seem to have done any great things for yourself by going away?",
  "62861": "But if I lose?",
  "62862": "There, who are you?",
  "62863": "Or, perhaps, you may have the precious object she wants in your collection?",
  "62864": "Who do you think should be sent there?",
  "62865": "And what for?",
  "62866": "But, my dear fellow, in that case, why didn't you get him a pauper's funeral?",
  "62867": "Should he place his catastrophe as a third associate in their felicity?",
  "62868": "Can you speak, lady?",
  "62869": "He has extensive house property in the city and three places of business and isn't it to his own advantage to keep down the rates?",
  "62870": "Do what?",
  "62871": "That so?",
  "62872": "And you followed the business of a tailor?",
  "62873": "But how did you gain them?",
  "62874": "Whither should they go, and where should be the new seat of the mission?",
  "62875": "Why can't you let me alone?",
  "62876": "How does his apoplex?",
  "62877": "Ca vous amuse, la vie?",
  "62878": "You would throw over one that has stood by you this five years in favour of a man that you never saw before in your life?",
  "62879": "Ceremonies then are a subsequent thing?",
  "62880": "What can be keeping him?",
  "62881": "Some intrigue, D'Herblay?",
  "62882": "Why do you laugh, sir?",
  "62883": "Should she speak to her?",
  "62884": "How dared they so much as THINK of such a thing?",
  "62885": "Should she open the door or should she not?",
  "62886": "Now, while you have tyranny in so great a degree walled in, and see your enemies over your heads, to what purpose is it to take counsel?",
  "62887": "But don't you know the higher you climb, the colder it gets?",
  "62888": "You do not know that you love me?",
  "62889": "What in thunder has that to do with you?",
  "62890": "No one at home?",
  "62891": "How is it over?",
  "62892": "Is it business?",
  "62893": "What's a ball through the chest?",
  "62894": "Has he found time to tell you scandal about me?",
  "62895": "Well how can I help it?",
  "62896": "Is my master not here, sir?",
  "62897": "What has our providential rescue to do with altering your feelings toward me?",
  "62898": "Where is it now, the glory and the dream?",
  "62899": "When is one pleasure twice as great as another?",
  "62900": "Is marriage so demoralising as that?",
  "62901": "Did he take any luggage?",
  "62902": "Seeing the old man?",
  "62903": "But there were three races, were there not?",
  "62904": "Was it the effect of the balmy climate alone which recalled him to health?",
  "62905": "Is it paid for?",
  "62906": "Were you speaking of me?",
  "62907": "An emancipator?",
  "62908": "These are the orders, are they?",
  "62909": "Does SHE look like the mother of six?",
  "62910": "Who is the agent?",
  "62911": "What tilbury?",
  "62912": "How can we ever thank you?",
  "62913": "Is it probable?",
  "62914": "Kitchens?",
  "62915": "And then should not the charity be all the more profound, in proportion as the fall is great?",
  "62916": "How was he to get through his present difficulty?",
  "62917": "What have you to say?",
  "62918": "You know?",
  "62919": "Is there any place at liberty that you know of now, uncle, that I should do for?",
  "62920": "But, why should I conceal my sentiments?",
  "62921": "But won't you join me at supper, now 'tis waiting and all?",
  "62922": "Can't you tell whether a man's guying you or whether you're being offered the biggest scoop your dull dishrag of a paper ever had?",
  "62923": "Whom do you mean by THEY?",
  "62924": "Their graces?",
  "62925": "Shall I call him?",
  "62926": "How and why could it be mistaken?",
  "62927": "What the devil do you mean by this?",
  "62928": "If a man in selecting a residence, do not fix on one where such prevail, how can he be wise?",
  "62929": "Are you sure you don't hurt your hand, doing that?",
  "62930": "Well, mon cher, have you got the manifesto?",
  "62931": "How, you are going soon?",
  "62932": "So saying, he fixed his eyes upon me, and asked if I had seen him tremble?",
  "62933": "Isn't she enormous?",
  "62934": "But the man who was under him?",
  "62935": "Did he still cherish hope?",
  "62936": "Isn't it a dreadful feeling?",
  "62937": "Why funny?",
  "62938": "What have I done?",
  "62939": "Do you know much of him?",
  "62940": "Are you quite ready, gentlemen?",
  "62941": "To get what's left me sold by auction?",
  "62942": "What is to be done in these circumstances?",
  "62943": "Could he be sure that he was not their accomplice?",
  "62944": "Hwat heved heo ionswered?",
  "62945": "Did the people shout at all?",
  "62946": "Excuse me,' and you believe that is sufficient?",
  "62947": "You aren't taking hoboes, are you?",
  "62948": "I daresay you've heard of her?",
  "62949": "Perhaps you'd care to come in and have a drink on your way?",
  "62950": "Must I receive it, or leave it in the hands of the notary?",
  "62951": "What is the meaning of that?",
  "62952": "Oh, you know him?",
  "62953": "Sir, have you finished supper?",
  "62954": "What did I get by that?",
  "62955": "What has become of the faith which has hitherto carried you so bravely through all our difficulties?",
  "62956": "Then what will you have me say?",
  "62957": "A nobleman retired from service, is he not?",
  "62958": "Missus's?",
  "62959": "How, then, am I mad?",
  "62960": "Could you possibly wish for a more favorable conjunction of circumstances?",
  "62961": "How should I know?",
  "62962": "What had been his object?",
  "62963": "And would that be all?",
  "62964": "Do you remember that after less than a year of married life you stood on the verge of an abyss?",
  "62965": "Aren't they really terrifying?",
  "62966": "Don't you see, now, what's the matter with that ha'nted room?",
  "62967": "Why should I die, then, or basely despair?",
  "62968": "And anyone else?",
  "62969": "And what did he tell 'ee next?",
  "62970": "Do you never feel sick of it?",
  "62971": "Was this precaution or humility?",
  "62972": "Any men on it?",
  "62973": "Was it possible they heard not?",
  "62974": "Why do men halt between two opinions, and expect impossibilities?",
  "62975": "What are you wanting?",
  "62976": "Why aren't you in bed?",
  "62977": "Will not the good people respond to a united and earnest appeal from us?",
  "62978": "Who could be suspected of this mischief?",
  "62979": "But why should I not receive her?",
  "62980": "But from whom is that letter?",
  "62981": "Should we not then say that the master had only fulfilled a sacred obligation of duty?",
  "62982": "Have you them?",
  "62983": "What, gentlemen, is your verdict?",
  "62984": "What's a tall man unless he fight?",
  "62985": "Did that person not come back, then?",
  "62986": "Was there any other spirit but rum in the room?",
  "62987": "Do you wish to know clearly celestial matters, what they rightly are?",
  "62988": "Heavily?",
  "62989": "Do you want me to tear out my hair in handfuls?",
  "62990": "If the officer be accused of dishonesty, how shall it be made out?",
  "62991": "Where is the cure?",
  "62992": "Are you on the ground?",
  "62993": "You mentioned a fowl, I think?",
  "62994": "Upon what?",
  "62995": "Is not this an extraordinary tale?",
  "62996": "What are you meddling with my deeds for?",
  "62997": "Who is it, then, that you want to see?",
  "62998": "Is it to be yes at last?",
  "62999": "What made you think she would be here?",
  "63000": "WHO is in the room?",
  "63001": "What was there to be seen there?",
  "63002": "Was there left now nothing but to break off from the happy creative being, was the time up?",
  "63003": "You are not going out, uncle?",
  "63004": "What does it matter where it comes from?",
  "63005": "You are determined, then, to push your fortune in other lands?",
  "63006": "Ain't he played me tricks enough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time?",
  "63007": "Why should I be ashamed of myself?",
  "63008": "And there are four of you?",
  "63009": "How will it do, how will it do?",
  "63010": "Did you see the libraries and schools!?",
  "63011": "I should like to know whether you have the same notion which I have of this study?",
  "63012": "Who is going to dress me?",
  "63013": "Think of who?",
  "63014": "What is it you want to distract you?",
  "63015": "Whose beneficence was like his?",
  "63016": "Who taught her?",
  "63017": "It was not he, then, you came to seek?",
  "63018": "Who'll have her?",
  "63019": "Did you speak to him?",
  "63020": "Have you seen fifty frightful men pass down from the cliffs into this forest, my children?",
  "63021": "Will your ladyship stay the night?",
  "63022": "What can he be picking up?",
  "63023": "Then why on earth does she do it?",
  "63024": "How could this be, sir?",
  "63025": "Shall I tell you why?",
  "63026": "What is the day of the month?",
  "63027": "What shall become of me?",
  "63028": "Hasn't she come back yet?",
  "63029": "Well, have you made up your mind to this journey?",
  "63030": "And him you found?",
  "63031": "Did he get his brain fever, and then write all those terrible things, or had he some cause for it all?",
  "63032": "Was she young?",
  "63033": "Cosette?",
  "63034": "Have you seen?",
  "63035": "Where shall we go?",
  "63036": "Or what is this?",
  "63037": "Have you, indeed, my boy?",
  "63038": "Have you seen the general?",
  "63039": "What have you been doing during my absence?",
  "63040": "To you, eh?",
  "63041": "But can the musician by his art make men unmusical?",
  "63042": "Well, and your guardian must be brave if he is to fight well?",
  "63043": "Has my girl any objection?",
  "63044": "Now, when the restriction is removed, what is to prevent it from going still farther?",
  "63045": "But, I say, do you make any progress in it?",
  "63046": "But who should less expect from you?",
  "63047": "Then how d'you know that we have the truth now?",
  "63048": "I would have you consider seriously of it?",
  "63049": "And what money 'ud he want?",
  "63050": "What would you have, sir?",
  "63051": "Were they asleep?",
  "63052": "Yet if he is not the maker, what is he in relation to the bed?",
  "63053": "Of complexion and brown hair?",
  "63054": "Have they contributed to encourage the diligence, and to improve the abilities, of the teachers?",
  "63055": "What about marriage?",
  "63056": "My friend, whom, then, will you serve?",
  "63057": "Did I forbid myself to think of him in any other light than as a paymaster?",
  "63058": "How is it that justice and isolation always accompany each other?",
  "63059": "And how is it to be parried?",
  "63060": "The rabbit?",
  "63061": "What could he have wanted there?",
  "63062": "Rob?",
  "63063": "So there is a hole?",
  "63064": "Why pay rent?",
  "63065": "Should he try to catch her eye, and then raise his hat?",
  "63066": "The first question is, whether music is or is not to make a part of education?",
  "63067": "Will you do me the favor to explain this enigma to me?",
  "63068": "Is there any other point which you would like to ask about?",
  "63069": "The bed might have been let down by some artificial means?",
  "63070": "But what are you up to?",
  "63071": "But what about you, and the rowing?",
  "63072": "Oh, why wasn't somebody kind to her?",
  "63073": "May I have a grill for dinner?",
  "63074": "What need he add to such a desperate proof in figures?",
  "63075": "Did you promise to marry her?",
  "63076": "Did you speculate any more?",
  "63077": "Haven't you your power of attorney?",
  "63078": "What, let me ask, is a man in and of himself?",
  "63079": "Why so much beating about the bush?",
  "63080": "Or am I not to know?",
  "63081": "What does your chamber open on?",
  "63082": "Come to where four roads meet?",
  "63083": "What's this round your neck?",
  "63084": "And which?",
  "63085": "Why do you want to do that at this particular time, when at every previous time that I have proposed it you have refused?",
  "63086": "What gallows?",
  "63087": "Do you think you can help me, dear grandpapa?",
  "63088": "Why do you sit out here all alone?",
  "63089": "O why was that so?",
  "63090": "You know what they say of my lodger?",
  "63091": "I wonder who 'tis?",
  "63092": "But if he gives you?",
  "63093": "What money is this?",
  "63094": "And would it be indiscreet to ask you the name of this powerful protector?",
  "63095": "I beg your pardon?",
  "63096": "What do you call liberty, monsieur?",
  "63097": "You'll mention that I called, perhaps?",
  "63098": "You notice my ring?",
  "63099": "What revenge?",
  "63100": "Won't you have an egg beaten up in a glass of milk while you're waiting?",
  "63101": "What say ye?",
  "63102": "Against your father?",
  "63103": "Is it all right in the new way?",
  "63104": "Are those horrid creatures gone?",
  "63105": "Why does he then exceed all bounds at once?",
  "63106": "How are you sure?",
  "63107": "Does any one live, who knows what set purposes you have, half as well as I do?",
  "63108": "Could it be that these were four words, and that they were intended to carry a message to me?",
  "63109": "There is nothing you desire?",
  "63110": "Will you let me make the tea?",
  "63111": "What else did he say to you?",
  "63112": "What is there in all that for me to think about?",
  "63113": "By pulling out a bar and pushing down a door?",
  "63114": "Aye?",
  "63115": "Well, miss?",
  "63116": "But what was to be done?",
  "63117": "Was the projectile under some foreign influence?",
  "63118": "Will you begin, if you please, and put in the thatch again, just as if you were doing it for your mother's cabin?",
  "63119": "Shall we not set forth?",
  "63120": "Do you, sir?",
  "63121": "Do you think this does?",
  "63122": "Do you think you could hustle something in the way of a little lunch, old man?",
  "63123": "What could this NN be?",
  "63124": "And how did he behave, madam?",
  "63125": "How much do you require for my ransom?",
  "63126": "Wouldn't you like him to dribble into the great flood?",
  "63127": "But are your relatives so very poor?",
  "63128": "What is all this dancing up and down?",
  "63129": "If all were only vanity, who would mind it?",
  "63130": "Would I not give my life to secure it?",
  "63131": "But will his warriors consent?",
  "63132": "But how did you proceed?",
  "63133": "What was it placed there for?",
  "63134": "Are YOU there?",
  "63135": "Or perhaps it is the pale morning light which takes your colour away?",
  "63136": "Why did you not bring it at once?",
  "63137": "The messenger that brought it, said would you be so good as read it by my lantern?",
  "63138": "If anyone arrives in my absence, do the honors for me, will you not?",
  "63139": "Has the breakfast been all right?",
  "63140": "Of what day?",
  "63141": "Has anyone?",
  "63142": "I trust you are in good health, and that your families are all well?",
  "63143": "Don't you see them, in that box far back?",
  "63144": "Was it the fall of some mighty pillar of the globe?",
  "63145": "Well, what now?",
  "63146": "Think?",
  "63147": "And the youth repented, and became a good man?",
  "63148": "He rends defenseless women and little children in his lair, but how recently has one of you seen him fight with men?",
  "63149": "Pray, what may that portmanteau of yours weigh?",
  "63150": "You'll be sure to be stirring early and go with us?",
  "63151": "Will it be possible to draw water here tonight?",
  "63152": "Are any of the gallants within?",
  "63153": "Well, then, what do you make of your word AUSTRA?",
  "63154": "Where does the fun come in?",
  "63155": "Why not defend ourselves?",
  "63156": "Is the atmospheric condition, having once reached this density, to become final?",
  "63157": "Has he fallen into a lethargy, or is he dead?",
  "63158": "Could they go to the corral in this dark night?",
  "63159": "Should he treat it as belonging to him?",
  "63160": "Will he succeed in his purpose?",
  "63161": "Oh, how could you act so?",
  "63162": "And yet, he said, the number two is certainly not opposed to the number three?",
  "63163": "No lands neither?",
  "63164": "What were horses made for, if not to drag people uphill?",
  "63165": "In which of your characters, sir, will you give us leave to address you?",
  "63166": "Why have you thrown that away?",
  "63167": "Dead?",
  "63168": "Will you never correct yourself of that vile habit?",
  "63169": "And what did you think, sir, of what I said?",
  "63170": "What, then, it may be asked, is the good of being great?",
  "63171": "I wonder which craft I shall get?",
  "63172": "You promise?",
  "63173": "Not so much as out of bed?",
  "63174": "What's the good of tormenting him like this?",
  "63175": "What do you think of that?",
  "63176": "Can you not do anything you wish?",
  "63177": "But how were you to benefit?",
  "63178": "Rinaldo, why still so pensive?",
  "63179": "What can I do for you?",
  "63180": "What have I done to need his forgiveness?",
  "63181": "And whom I so dearly love?",
  "63182": "Only compatible with letting ME, you mean?",
  "63183": "If so, is he mad?",
  "63184": "How dared he think that he had discovered what so many wiser and clever men had overlooked?",
  "63185": "Do we eulogize the man who first perceives the dawn?",
  "63186": "Is she one of the performers?",
  "63187": "What rights does your majesty attach to this office of intendant?",
  "63188": "Money, I presume?",
  "63189": "In your arms?",
  "63190": "Pray to what is this attributable?",
  "63191": "How can it be otherwise with me?",
  "63192": "Peace?",
  "63193": "What work are you about now?",
  "63194": "Would not his hearers add to that sum?",
  "63195": "But passion for him?",
  "63196": "Who is he?",
  "63197": "Does your feminine tyranny require that when you say the thing you mean is one of several things, I should know it immediately by that mark?",
  "63198": "In what condition of mind were you?",
  "63199": "Aren't they pretty?",
  "63200": "Is it like that, dad?",
  "63201": "And how the devil did you come to fasten me out, you toothless hound?",
  "63202": "Spell it?",
  "63203": "How did I give it?",
  "63204": "What do you want with twenty sons?",
  "63205": "Where can I turn?",
  "63206": "Well, then, what kind o' brothers would it be that 'd stand in his way at sech a time?",
  "63207": "We are blocked up then?",

  "63214": "What are they, he said, and where shall I find them?",
  "63215": "Where is it?",
  "63216": "But, ye others, what do I see?",
  "63217": "But what is the use?",
  "63218": "Why not jine hands and forgit it?",
  "63219": "Don't you hear de trumpet sound?",
  "63220": "Which way lies their path?",
  "63221": "Are you engaged to that painter?",
  "63222": "I've convinced you it's impossible?",
  "63223": "Is it to lead us prisoners to the woods, or do you contemplate even some greater evil?",
  "63224": "Isn't it a romantic spot?",
  "63225": "Did not I work that waistcoat to make you genteel?",
  "63226": "And why is it impossible?",
  "63227": "What became of these men?",
  "63228": "Shall we shut the door, and lock it, or not?",
  "63229": "Why should you ever have been otherwise?",
  "63230": "Sparsit?",
  "63231": "When did you ever hear of me starving people into good behavior?",
  "63232": "It was you who sent for me?",
  "63233": "Oh, you haven't, haven't you?",
  "63234": "Is he going to deceive a SHIP CLERK?",
  "63235": "Has he any friends?",
  "63236": "Then can the convicts have been on board?",
  "63237": "Or that they were not the first statues?",
  "63238": "Rascal, what are you at there?",
  "63239": "Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?",
  "63240": "Not drawn towards drink, eh?",
  "63241": "Who then is the monarch, or where is the monarchy?",
  "63242": "Gridley?",
  "63243": "Ten, twenty, fifty, a hundred?",
  "63244": "How did this happen?",
  "63245": "Could she have so perjured herself, even in support of her generosity?",

  "63831": "What's the sense of it?",
  "63832": "Where is the guilty party here?",
  "63833": "And what happened to him afterwards?",
  "63834": "Is it a duty to postpone everything to a sense of injuries, and wrong to gratify a mother in a request like this?",
  "63835": "What will you do?",
  "63836": "Anything else, my lord?",
  "63837": "Dear mother, are you so resolved?",

  "63845": "How should they use it?",
  "63846": "Does he speak to you of this conspiracy?",
  "63847": "And was SHE married?",
  "63848": "You left your door open?",
  "63849": "Is there danger of another?",
  "63850": "What had her infancy been?",
  "63851": "How much money have you left?",
  "63852": "She won't bite?",
  "63853": "What is the matter?",
  "63854": "But what were you going to say?",
  "63855": "She is no relation of his?",
  "63856": "What hard fortune brought us here?",
  "63857": "What if she were so called?",
  "63858": "In other words, should strict impartiality be aimed at?",
  "63859": "And what did he offer?",
  "63860": "Why not go and try to get speech of him and beg for justice?",
  "63861": "What shall you do in life?",
  "63862": "Was not that nearly what you said?",
  "63863": "Is not this a free country?",
  "63864": "Pears like this yer view 's quite refreshing, an't it, stranger?",
  "63865": "Which of these will be mine?",
  "63866": "How did you happen to be taken to a hospital?",
  "63867": "What is it?",
  "63868": "I brought it to the table near the fire, and asked him what he would have?",
  "63869": "Do you remember what you told me once, about her making all the apple parsties and doing all the cooking?",
  "63870": "Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind?",
  "63871": "Does this prove that ignorance and dependence domesticate them?",
  "63872": "Why do you not see this?",
  "63873": "Well, why wouldn't you?",
  "63874": "What is it makes the wolves to leave the woods?",
  "63875": "It is useless?",
  "63876": "Would you rather I didn't talk?",
  "63877": "Mad, is he?",
  "63878": "Is it a pure a priori, or is it an empirical intuition?",
  "63879": "Why does it not encourage its citizens to put out its faults, and do better than it would have them?",
  "63880": "You do work hard, don't you?",
  "63881": "Have you told them where to find me?",
  "63882": "Doesn't it depend a bit on what she regards as charming?",
  "63883": "Where, then, is the ship?",
  "63884": "I'm not very exacting, am I?",
  "63885": "And in what state of mind has he returned to you?",
  "63886": "Didn't you see the gold with your own two eyes?",
  "63887": "What was it that he did?",
  "63888": "Well, then, tell us frankly, what do you think of her personal appearance?",
  "63889": "Why, for example, should the king of a primitive community be prohibited from sleeping lying down?",
  "63890": "Where am I to join on?",
  "63891": "What right have you to bid me leave this house, sir?",
  "63892": "Who would endure this for many lives?",
  "63893": "Which is best off?",
  "63894": "But have they considered whether a better form could have been substituted?",
  "63895": "Tell me, where is the place that men call hell?",
  "63896": "Then will she die too?",
  "63897": "Need it be said that no such measures could destroy that tendency?",
  "63898": "Od's precious, come away, man, what do you mean?",
  "63899": "May I go and help carry the things to the poor little children?",
  "63900": "Have heard them say that there is nothing pleasanter than to get rid of their pain?",
  "63901": "Who could see?",
  "63902": "Have you any more to stake?",
  "63903": "What shall you tell her?",
  "63904": "What like is he?",
  "63905": "Is this of envy or no?",
  "63906": "Why, WHY do they torment me and say I am going to marry you?",
  "63907": "If I went to sleep as I proposed, how could the atmosphere in the chamber be regenerated in the interim?",
  "63908": "I suppose you have searched her desk and things?",
  "63909": "I mean can't you put on your own clothes?",
  "63910": "What, after all, was this new oath?",
  "63911": "What then are we to conclude from these facts and considerations?",
  "63912": "How might it fare more gently with you in all the world?",
  "63913": "What avarice?",
  "63914": "Has he gone crazy?",
  "63915": "Hurt me?",
  "63916": "Who's not playing fair?",
  "63917": "They were none of them among our friends at the lodge, then?",
  "63918": "Has it been so kept?",
  "63919": "So you are going away in the fall?",
  "63920": "In the flesh?",
  "63921": "Wouldn't you teach them to play on the piano, and paint on velvet?",
  "63922": "Where is my wife?",
  "63923": "Where is my native place?",
  "63924": "And had he married the valiant matron's daughter, as he promised?",
  "63925": "Everything's made to be played, with and broken, isn't it, young 'un?",
  "63926": "Whatcher take me for, hey?",
  "63927": "What do you mean, the rabbit?",
  "63928": "Now what do you say?",
  "63929": "And what sort of men do they graduate?",
  "63930": "He knew then?",
  "63931": "Why must one read books before he can be considered to have learned?",
  "63932": "What was she insolent about?",
  "63933": "You don't hesitate to take a place at my side, do you?",
  "63934": "Daze my eyes, and isn't there?",
  "63935": "Do you not see his heart is fast breaking?",
  "63936": "Can this be possible, uncle?",
  "63937": "Why should they?",
  "63938": "Have you forgotten the day?",
  "63939": "Do you see anything there?",
  "63940": "What is the object of this assembly?",
  "63941": "Good heavens, are you ill?",
  "63942": "Well, did you dig up the watch?",
  "63943": "You will arrest him?",
  "63944": "And aren't you?",
  "63945": "What uncanny secret did it hold?",
  "63946": "Why is she thus possessed, and why does she not spare herself?",

  "63948": "At any rate, you have some walks in the neighbourhood?",
  "63949": "You have been a soldier?",
  "63950": "But why a year?",
  "63951": "Who's that laughing at me?",
  "63952": "Where, then, would have been her navy, her trade and even her existence?",
  "63953": "What do you hear from your mother?",
  "63954": "How could I settle the point forever?",
  "63955": "What does that spell?",

  "63958": "What did happen?",
  "63959": "Is the shepherd said to be just to his sheep and his dogs?",
  "63960": "Why do you keep the secrets of that man, when they mean death to so many?",
  "63961": "But if I pursue and nothing gain, what will it profit me to come up with him?",
  "63962": "Do you wish to get out?",
  "63963": "Clara, are you ready to come home?",
  "63964": "Did you ever hear of such ingratitude?",
  "63965": "The best school?",
  "63966": "Get me up, can't ye?",
  "63967": "Bread?",
  "63968": "Dare they to hope a poet for their friend?",
  "63969": "What do I deduce from this?",
  "63970": "When did that person come here, waiter?",
  "63971": "You once had a horse you cared a great deal for, didn't you?",
  "63972": "What has made you so disobedient and unfaithful?",
  "63973": "You're not in bed?",
  "63974": "What spot?",
  "63975": "Did he believe?",
  "63976": "And now, is this all you have to tell me?",
  "63977": "Could he forego the renown of being the first wit of his age?",
  "63978": "What was he hoping for?",
  "63979": "What name am I to say?",
  "63980": "Elm or fir, both of which abounded in the island?",
  "63981": "And why will they not?",

  "63983": "What if you should die first?",
  "63984": "As day by day the sun sank lower and lower in the sky, could he be certain that the luminary would ever retrace his heavenly road?",
  "63985": "Had they nothing else to say to one another?",
  "63986": "Who told you to steal?",
  "63987": "Did I not tell you how quick and resolute she was?",
  "63988": "Is there any example of an individual object that escaped the government of that law in the whole history of the world?",
  "63989": "Why tarry ye?",
  "63990": "Did he give a reason?",
  "63991": "How did you come here?",
  "63992": "Did I break through one of your rings, that you spread that damned ice on the causeway?",
  "63993": "He asked himself, or were they playing a part?",
  "63994": "Is it true that my mind is only a harmony, and my soul a vortex?",
  "63995": "But if I do fight, you will surely not object to giving me a lesson or two in shooting and fencing?",
  "63996": "Are we women?",
  "63997": "Ah, but it isn't, is it?",
  "63998": "Have you more to say?",
  "63999": "What had really happened?",
  "64000": "How if his death were occasioned by a wound received in defending his master?",
  "64001": "For what is there more prompt, more unexpected, more abbreviatory of space and time, than the maturity of an obligation?",
  "64002": "Would they be right in the future?",
  "64003": "And isn't he?",
  "64004": "And what do you say is your surmise as to your present position?",
  "64005": "Suppose now I ask, why I rather than anybody else?",
  "64006": "If what?",
  "64007": "Have you a heart?",
  "64008": "With me?",
  "64009": "Did you ever hear of such an idea?",

  "64012": "Won't you come in, brother?",
  "64013": "So you are good enough to pass my appearance?",
  "64014": "Is it tobacco?",
  "64015": "I ask you what can I do?",
  "64016": "Could it have been an early hornet?",
  "64017": "Who is that?",
  "64018": "Can you drink anything?",
  "64019": "Why not pursue an end confessedly good by peaceable and regular means?",
  "64020": "Did he come to arrest me?",
  "64021": "Whither so fast, child?",
  "64022": "Ah, why will you not unseal my lips?",
  "64023": "Does this look like confidence?",
  "64024": "Has it gone well?",
  "64025": "Admires the jay the insect's gilded wings?",
  "64026": "And did they often get a chance to do that?",
  "64027": "And do I love?",
  "64028": "UNDER THE CROSS,' hey?",
  "64029": "What did you look at, so fixedly?",
  "64030": "Why stop?",
  "64031": "And of what are you so sure?",
  "64032": "And the friend he regards and describes as one in whom he has an interest, and the other as a stranger in whom he has no interest?",
  "64033": "Can't you see what a beautiful thing it would make?",
  "64034": "For all that, are not our dresses as beautiful as yours?",
  "64035": "Why are they fighting?",
  "64036": "Is the danger you apprehended last night gone by now, sir?",
  "64037": "When the winds blow and the seas flow?",
  "64038": "Do you call this acting the part of a man and a gentleman, sir?",

  "65351": "His wife wouldn't do it, I suppose?",
  "65352": "Had he any means of making this calculation?",
  "65353": "Or what part which as a man grows lean never falls away with a too perceptible diminution?",
  "65354": "Do you go with us, and unsettle your mind for the university?",

  "65410": "Che cosa?",
  "65411": "What's the good of making so much of it?",
  "65412": "And why did you tell us this?",
  "65413": "Then why do you come?",
  "65414": "And what is the worst of it?",
  "65415": "Why, whom do you mean to say that you are going to let her marry?",
  "65416": "Why not, sir?",
  "65417": "What city is that?",
  "65418": "Where is the manifesto?",
  "65419": "Prince, can it be that you don't even yet see what's at the root of it all?",
  "65420": "Has his character not been formed by them?",
  "65421": "What speed would then animate the projectile?",
  "65422": "Shall I go?",
  "65423": "What sort of porridge?",
  "65424": "You go with him?",
  "65425": "Yet, what was to be done?",
  "65426": "Is that a shadow crossing that wrinkle of starlight in the water?",
  "65427": "How many constables have you?",
  "65428": "But you do believe she has a letter from your husband?",
  "65429": "Do you intend to remain in the house any time?",

  "65433": "When you saw her last, did she mention anyone's name?",
  "65434": "But how could they get an idea that it would be so amusing with practically nothing to go upon?",
  "65435": "Did they not know that by doing so they plunged the world and all its people into uttermost darkness both day and night?",
  "65436": "Don't we?",

  "65446": "Are you not vegetable, also?",
  "65447": "You were not yourself at fault at all, then?",
  "65448": "Why, but which of the munition is miscarried, ha?",
  "65449": "Yes, is there a family free from sorrow now?",

  "65472": "How shall I know that?",
  "65473": "That's the best way, ain't it?",
  "65474": "To the wery top, sir?",
  "65475": "What will become of us?",
  "65476": "With those whom you deliver up to me, you say?",
  "65477": "Oh, do you think he won't?",

  "65483": "What would he do with coals?",
  "65484": "Surely you will stay and have some dinner?",
  "65485": "But what does it all mean?",
  "65486": "This slipshod style, how accounted for?",
  "65487": "Can it be, then, that all this is done simply through misapprehension?",
  "65488": "Not even the captain who takes the order?",
  "65489": "Is that seen in the diminished resources of the country?",
  "65490": "Can anybody who sees him entertain any other opinion, mama?",
  "65491": "Oh, the evil is that I am NOT jealous, is it?",
  "65492": "What sort of a wife should I make for you, after all I have said?",
  "65493": "Do you want to cast me away, and throw me, like a ball of which you are tired, to another?",
  "65494": "Where is your husband?",
  "65495": "Till they've left the country?",
  "65496": "And your friends?",
  "65497": "Shall I not yet see the face?",
  "65498": "No bones broke?",
  "65499": "Of what use is a monkey like you in battle?",
  "65500": "Does my exalted queen allow me to begin?",
  "65501": "And why separate?",
  "65502": "First, madame, who are you?",
  "65503": "What, your wife, married only four days ago, prefers some other person to yourself?",
  "65504": "Am I to sacrifice my feelings and my honor for money?",
  "65505": "Not late surely?",
  "65506": "Can't I squirt that?",
  "65507": "She has arrived at that, she's really content with it, in the absence of proof?",
  "65508": "Have you any notion what's at the back?",
  "65509": "But not the air you breathe?",
  "65510": "Or is it yours?",
  "65511": "Is your time, then, expired, since I find you in a fair way to return there?",
  "65512": "But what was the use of them?",
  "65513": "My lord, have you any commands?",
  "65514": "But he is hardly so lively today, is he?",
  "65515": "If you see me doing anything wrong, just remind me by a wink, will you?",
  "65516": "Shut you up in that cage again?",
  "65517": "What maketh all this for our present purpose?",
  "65518": "But is it possible, that any of you can be such barbarians, so supremely wicked, as to abuse it?",
  "65519": "Was it a good one?",
  "65520": "You're coming up to lunch, I hope?",
  "65521": "And also why you walk about on tiptoe and always seem as if you were going to whisper a secret in my ear whenever you come near me?",
  "65522": "Why, with such rank in the learned world, had he come hither?",
  "65523": "And as to the ships, deny that article?",
  "65524": "Well then, have you come here for HER?",
  "65525": "Why on earth don't you go up and change?",
  "65526": "Ain't I a pickle?",
  "65527": "But that which is neither was just now shown to be rest and not motion, and in a mean between them?",
  "65528": "Is he married or single?",
  "65529": "Why do you want to put me under such terrible obligations?",
  "65530": "Do you think it will carry you to the upper end of the lake?",
  "65531": "Come, you are accounted for, you are here, but where are your friends?",
  "65532": "Favorably or otherwise?",
  "65533": "Can you see him still?",
  "65534": "Who was the condemned?",
  "65535": "When did we first hear of his opposition?",
  "65536": "Aren't you ashamed of yourself?",
  "65537": "Indeed?",
  "65538": "To the masters?",
  "65539": "Correction of what?",
  "65540": "What were the words about?",
  "65541": "You will excuse me, will you not?",
  "65542": "Where's the bill?",
  "65543": "There was a fellow, eh?",
  "65544": "For what else can have an influence of this nature?",
  "65545": "How shall I support it?",
  "65546": "What was there in those words that any common acquaintance might not say to another?",
  "65547": "What purse is that you are talking about?",
  "65548": "Isn't it wonderful how much fathers DO know?",
  "65549": "Call it?",
  "65550": "Who will explain this profound antagonism between our conscience and our will?",
  "65551": "Sid, was it you that told?",
  "65552": "You know where I'm to be found, I suppose, sir, in case you should have anything to say to me?",
  "65553": "But I may ask you two questions, may I?",
  "65554": "Anything good?",
  "65555": "Are they all dead?",
  "65556": "How in the world did that fellow get in here?",
  "65557": "Do you know it is nearly seven?",
  "65558": "Is that the royal palace?",
  "65559": "Is he handsome?",
  "65560": "How could the flogger of urchins be otherwise than animated and joyous?",
  "65561": "And nowhere else?",
  "65562": "Does it hurt your head?",
  "65563": "Where WOULD he live?",
  "65564": "You are going to let me come to see you, aren't you?",
  "65565": "He had found him at last, and how?",
  "65566": "Can I ever forget?",
  "65567": "What do you want of him?",
  "65568": "Do you understand anything about it?",
  "65569": "What counsel is now to be taken?",
  "65570": "You know where they are?",
  "65571": "In fact, what is it that takes place?",
  "65572": "You were found in a doorway, weren't you?",
  "65573": "Has my dream come true?",
  "65574": "Won't you tell it to me?",
  "65575": "Will you come over and help me?",
  "65576": "Should he look his fill and then drive away?",
  "65577": "If he died like a dog among the mountains, what was to become of his revenge then?",
  "65578": "And you are the better for it?",
  "65579": "Why did they preserve so miserable and detested a life?",
  "65580": "Which man?",
  "65581": "Whom do you suppose?",
  "65582": "What is your master's disease?",
  "65583": "That is true, but still why didn't you capture him?",
  "65584": "Quint?",
  "65585": "Why should she hand it over to anyone else?",
  "65586": "Where's the other?",
  "65587": "What has he been doing now?",
  "65588": "What do you want to be afraid for?",
  "65589": "You wanted to join hands with me in the ring, if I recollect?",
  "65590": "Or one of my friends, what matters?",
  "65591": "How can you ask me anything so foolish?",
  "65592": "Vere is your friends, dot ought to help you?",

  "65595": "Letellier?",
  "65596": "Why do you sell nothing but music?",
  "65597": "Yet, how should a quality so useful escape promulgation, but by the obscurity of the language in which it was delivered?",
  "65598": "But why 'still?",
  "65599": "Does she not drive well?",
  "65600": "Did he not strike the clout thrice?",
  "65601": "But why should you decide now?",
  "65602": "But wasn't there still a piece missing?",

  "65611": "Handsome?",
  "65612": "With this cat?",
  "65613": "Do I look as if I suppressed anything, meant anything but what I said, had any reservation at all, no matter what?",
