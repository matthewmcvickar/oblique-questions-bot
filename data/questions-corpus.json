  "1335": "Mother, did you not say a little while ago, that there was nothing in the world you would not do for me, if I asked you?",
  "1336": "Will you speak?",
  "1337": "What danger do you foresee?",
  "1338": "But you still think the lode does come through into our house?",
  "1339": "But what could be done now?",
  "1340": "They didn't tease her to death, did they?",
  "1341": "It is old and distingue, is it not?",

  "1343": "How was he, too, to be paid?",
  "1344": "When can you reach here?",
  "1345": "Or why not become a monk himself?",
  "1346": "Since nature had here provided vegetable nourishment, why should not the terrible mammals be there too?",
  "1347": "Where's your secret?",
  "1348": "But you will go?",
  "1349": "What words were those?",
  "1350": "She'd be so scandalised?",
  "1351": "And suppose that I refuse to go with you?",
  "1352": "You won't tell?",
  "1353": "Of me?",
  "1354": "For the state you've let yourself get into?",
  "1355": "Would you care to see for yourself?",
  "1356": "Would you like to see her?",
  "1357": "Do you understand now?",
  "1358": "Shall I get back to see my wife and children?",
  "1359": "Who put it there?",
  "1360": "Whence will curses come at your command?",
  "1361": "Why should he come because you have asked him?",
  "1362": "What if she does not love me?",
  "1363": "Sister, what meanes this melanchollie walke?",
  "1364": "And why had he not done so?",
  "1365": "I hope there's no bad news in that telegram?",
  "1366": "Who goes?",
  "1367": "What have you done to it?",
  "1368": "Is a new world coming?",
  "1369": "And you will always love him?",
  "1370": "Hold your tongue, can't ye?",
  "1371": "Is it not the desire of seeing a husband again from whom you have been separated for a week?",
  "1372": "Nevvy?",
  "1373": "Are you doing nothing for them?",
  "1374": "How much did the other mug get?",
  "1375": "You going to have all the girls and boys?",
  "1376": "No offence, I hope, brother?",

  "1379": "A problem?",
  "1380": "Round the world?",
  "1381": "Have you seen the young countess?",
  "1382": "May I take it to your sister?",
  "1383": "Have you ever trodden on a rake and had the handle jump up and hit you?",
  "1384": "Well, I suppose you'll want a dish o' tay, or victuals of some sort, hey?",
  "1385": "Why speak you not?",
  "1386": "Some of the country people?",
  "1387": "Do you know, sir, that your mucous membranes are in a state of high irritation, apparent by the papillce at the tip of your tongue?",
  "1388": "There was the door that would lead me within the prison, but where was the means to open it?",
  "1389": "Are there not moments when one grows sick of grinning and tumbling, and the jingling of cap and bells?",
  "1390": "What was that, monsieur?",
  "1391": "A brave lodging for such as we, is it not so?",
  "1392": "How the devil did it get into my boots?",
  "1393": "Think they'll see us?",
  "1394": "Gave it away?",
  "1395": "You are aware that he has disappeared?",
  "1396": "Whence come the highest mountains?",
  "1397": "Have you not put that question to your soldiers?",
  "1398": "What better had he to hope for, if he waited longer?",
  "1399": "Can't you think of anything to do?",
  "1400": "Shall I retreat?",
  "1401": "Would either be happy in such a horrible misalliance?",
  "1402": "And you had no punishments of any kind?",
  "1403": "Tell me what he is going to do?",
  "1404": "Don't I deserve even gratitude in return?",

  "1412": "Is he here?",
  "1413": "But if she had cared for him why did she not let him help her?",
  "1414": "But what did you think upon the road?",
  "1415": "I am a prisoner, then?",
  "1416": "If an enemy, why do you fawn on me?",
  "1417": "Well, then, if you obtain the reprieve?",
  "1418": "But how could she explain her husband's statements as to the cheque, which had been shown to be altogether false?",

  "1427": "When can you do so?",
  "1428": "Don't your stummick tell you?",
  "1429": "Do you really think so?",
  "1430": "But why isn't the end of the world as good as the beginning?",
  "1431": "May I hold the pens?",
  "1432": "Tain't much good now, is it?",
  "1433": "What are you pulling a man's arm off for?",
  "1434": "If there be no unchanging mirror, bright and clean, how can there be various images, unreal and temporary, reflected in it?",
  "1435": "A sentence?",
  "1436": "Why should ye?",
  "1437": "What's that you say, eh?",
  "1438": "O the poesie, the poesie?",

  "1444": "Why did you write anonymously to worry so noble and generous a lady?",
  "1445": "If he were not dead, where would his vengeance stop?",
  "1446": "You've seen a private car some time in your life?",
  "1447": "Which boulevard?",
  "1448": "How is he now?",
  "1449": "Who could have suggested to him such an act as this?",
  "1450": "Well, sir, said the dear little miss, then you will not let me go home with my aunt, will you?",
  "1451": "Well, you gave him the two hundred francs I had left for him?",
  "1452": "Do you hear him?",
  "1453": "You're not going to be jealous, are you?",
  "1454": "And why so, when WE were not expected till night?",
  "1455": "But why has he waited till now?",
  "1456": "Are you blind, deaf, senseless, dead?",
  "1457": "What was their destination?",
  "1458": "Can it be there's no chance of it?",
  "1459": "The poor fellow had got the attorney to promise secrecy, but what of that?",
  "1460": "I wonder where are they, those good fellows?",
  "1461": "Why do we daily commit disagreeable and dangerous actions?",
  "1462": "What have these pests of the earth been doing to you?",
  "1463": "Where had they fled when the next morning I awoke?",
  "1464": "Did I wake or sleep?",
  "1465": "Are we going to take him as a servant?",
  "1466": "Why so fierce?",
  "1467": "Would you mind telling me, so that I can see whether you are not mistaken?",
  "1468": "How are your brains?",
  "1469": "Wot do they understand?",
  "1470": "Could any government do more to train the people in the way in which he would have them go?",
  "1471": "You won't give him up?",
  "1472": "After all, what good was this?",
  "1473": "You mean perhaps to be a painter?",
  "1474": "For whom was the first appointment?",
  "1475": "Well, what should I have done?",
  "1476": "Where's my considering cap?",
  "1477": "How did you come by this letter?",
  "1478": "One or other?",
  "1479": "Would he arouse him with a throb of agony?",
  "1480": "But, really, for mercy's sake, prince, what have I done?",
  "1481": "Has anything happened?",
  "1482": "Come up on the tramp?",
  "1483": "What was he doing on the tower?",
  "1484": "What did they contain of pleasure, of happiness, or of grief?",
  "1485": "What do you mean, cousin?",
  "1486": "But then, when you wish to embark, you are obliged to come to the surface of the water?",
  "1487": "What has he in his arms?",
  "1488": "For what now was the first thing you were taught?",
  "1489": "Shall we yield ourselves to him?",
  "1490": "Will you enter, and see my wife?",
  "1491": "Could it then be possible?",
  "1492": "What are these imperious sympathies?",
  "1493": "Could this, too, be a wig?",
  "1494": "Do you consider it an accidental case, prince?",
  "1495": "Will you add these twenty francs to the seven you have?",
  "1496": "And you failed?",
  "1497": "Then you know nothing of the city?",
  "1498": "Was that wise?",
  "1499": "They had a youth with them?",
  "1500": "Were they intelligent mechanisms?",
  "1501": "Are you in a place?",
  "1502": "Warn her?",
  "1503": "Shall we have it up here, or go down to the restaurant?",
  "1504": "And you say that one of your friends lives in that house?",
  "1505": "What does he send me?",
  "1506": "He was only talking to himself, saying 'Over, is it?",
  "1507": "And would not the deficiencies of one year be made up for by the surplus of another?",
  "1508": "I understood, of course, that he saw something, but what?",
  "1509": "You understan', do you?",
  "1510": "Where did you find so many diamonds?",
  "1511": "But tell me, senor, what do you call this excellent and rare adventure that has left us as we are left now?",
  "1512": "Why should you get into such a tantrum about nothing?",
  "1513": "Are you not nearly spent with the heat?",
  "1514": "Do you think you are where you used to be?",
  "1515": "Then the eleventh day must have been a holiday?",
  "1516": "But what can you expect of a creature from the deanery?",
  "1517": "The children?",
  "1518": "You are, doubtless, acquainted with a variety of languages, so as to have been able to read all these?",
  "1519": "What makes you think that?",
  "1520": "You mean his idea for his native place?",
  "1521": "Why then are we to believe the same thing of another girl whom we never saw, told by nobody knows who, nor when, nor where?",
  "1522": "Were they going to let him alone this time?",
  "1523": "Had you commissioned me?",
  "1524": "What has the change been?",
  "1525": "I say, won't you come to the studio and have a talk?",
  "1526": "And where is the next point?",
  "1527": "It is not such a very dreadful circumstance that we are odd people, is it?",
  "1528": "What says my nephew?",
  "1529": "Who's firing?",
  "1530": "Mamma, are you cross?",
  "1531": "Perhaps you think the poor might have their part?",
  "1532": "Then I am to blow my brains out?",
  "1533": "What is it then, for goodness' sake?",
  "1534": "Poison him?",
  "1535": "And do you hear?",
  "1536": "Why didn't you come and wake me?",
  "1537": "What shall we do?",
  "1538": "Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?",
  "1539": "What's this paper?",
  "1540": "Then it was to go to her that you left us?",
  "1541": "Are we not endowed with inner force to fight successfully against obstacles and difficulties, and to wrest trophies of glory from hardships?",
  "1542": "Then I am condemned, sire?",
  "1543": "Could he be trying to measure the thickness of the crust of the earth that lay between us and the world above?",
  "1544": "What do you mean to do about this you have seen?",
  "1545": "But your old friends of the musketeers?",
  "1546": "How to get rid of him?",
  "1547": "Go and call upon this girl?",
  "1548": "Till he yield to me?",
  "1549": "You're back from leave, I suppose?",
  "1550": "Where are the papers of this prisoner?",
  "1551": "I say, friends, have you heard?",
  "1552": "Well, I said, and how does the change from oligarchy into democracy arise?",
  "1553": "Will you let them come?",
  "1554": "Wot d'ye mean?",
  "1555": "I mean that are not there now?",
  "1556": "Why have they not got rid of him?",
  "1557": "And will you tell me what a gentleman is?",
  "1558": "Were you in love with him?",
  "1559": "Does a woman ever know how much such speeches cost?",
  "1560": "How is this seeming miracle accomplished?",
  "1561": "Do you not humble me if you are too proud to accept what is due to you from my brother?",
  "1562": "Did you have a nice walk?",
  "1563": "What have you got to say for yourself, you withered old fence, eh?",
  "1564": "Whence came it?",
  "1565": "Would it not be more like a man to go before his face, and take the satisfaction of a warrior?",
  "1566": "How much does the hire amount to since yesterday?",
  "1567": "Have you heard the password?",
  "1568": "But where are the huts?",
  "1569": "What would be the use?",
  "1570": "But how did she become so?",
  "1571": "As before?",
  "1572": "But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge?",
  "1573": "How can it be foreign?",
  "1574": "Which of your uncles do you like best?",
  "1575": "And what is it to be?",
  "1576": "That we may find it necessary to punish the injury you have done to us?",
  "1577": "Ex tempore?",
  "1578": "Their father is dead?",
  "1579": "Or what is gone with my lords your brethren?",
  "1580": "Well, then, how about the land?",
  "1581": "What business have you at all with these interviews?",
  "1582": "How long was she there?",
  "1583": "A whole bottle?",
  "1584": "Moved?",
  "1585": "Is he not a man of honour and feeling?",
  "1586": "For if we fail in this our fight he must surely win, and then where end we?",
  "1587": "The great question certainly was, what?",
  "1588": "He supposed he was right?",
  "1589": "Is nothing due to the man whom we have all such reason to love, and no reason in the world to think ill of?",
  "1590": "But when you are not sure whether it is a fact or not, what are you to do?",
  "1591": "Would you like to see 'em?",
  "1592": "Which of the two?",
  "1593": "Has either of them confided anything to you by word of mouth?",
  "1594": "Has he ploughed, sowed, reaped, mowed, winnowed, weeded?",
  "1595": "Opposite the scaffold?",
  "1596": "An hundred crowns?",
  "1597": "Has anyone gone for the opossum?",
  "1598": "Apiece?",
  "1599": "Eyes don't trouble you any more, do they?",
  "1600": "Monseigneur assures me that the devil has nothing to do with this?",
  "1601": "Well, is it not noble to defend the poets, and introduce to the public all the new scientific and political ideas?",
  "1602": "Is this just?",
  "1603": "But how can you get there?",
  "1604": "Would you help me?",
  "1605": "What of the race, my pulse?",
  "1606": "What right had they to weep over or to talk about her?",
  "1607": "What's he like, this lad?",
  "1608": "What do you think, can a man be suffocated with a wet cloth?",
  "1609": "Is the loin pork enough?",
  "1610": "Put it straight, will you?",
  "1611": "Are you not, comrade?",
  "1612": "How is that, my child?",
  "1613": "And what after that?",
  "1614": "Do you repent of your sins, and do you acknowledge death as a righteous expiation and punishment?",
  "1615": "Shall I serve my child by a lie?",
  "1616": "Hey, who's there?",
  "1617": "How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments?",
  "1618": "Is not death opposed to life?",
  "1619": "And how much will that pair of stockings be worth when she has finished them?",
  "1620": "Grimaud, why did you not tell me this?",
  "1621": "My superintendent would not find me any money?",
  "1622": "How came it yours?",
  "1623": "Besides, who is to choose the velvet and cut for this young dandy?",
  "1624": "And, I say, don't you think you'd better suggest at the same time that the men should smoke?",
  "1625": "Who wants a protector?",
  "1626": "ARE they memorials?",
  "1627": "Exactly of what else could a platform consist?",
  "1628": "Why are you making knots in that ribbon, and writing invisible characters on the floor with the point of that busy little foot?",
  "1629": "Of my own life?",
  "1630": "What do these sounds portend?",
  "1631": "And who knows it?",
  "1632": "Can you do it?",
  "1633": "Or are you going to keep it right alongside of us outrageous fellows?",
  "1634": "You consider that to be important?",
  "1635": "Should I?",
  "1636": "Has he, ma'am?",
  "1637": "What precaution?",
  "1638": "On his track?",
  "1639": "Was not he disguised?",
  "1640": "And the quilting of the stairs no where worn out, and bare?",
  "1641": "Won't you listen?",

  "1643": "You go back and watch that long, will you?",
  "1644": "Will they abandon them in misfortune?",
  "1645": "What, then, will you say?",
  "1646": "That don't seem very far out of the way now, do it?",
  "1647": "Why, is it hid all around?",
  "1648": "You think love is the ticket, do you?",
  "1649": "Old or young?",
  "1650": "Has no copy been taken?",
  "1651": "Do you love him, love him with all your heart and soul, with all the love your bosom can feel?",
  "1652": "And how do you feel about it?",
  "1653": "What are fireworks like?",
  "1654": "Whom am I and what am I?",
  "1655": "Oh, why had she sent her letter?",
  "1656": "Do you conceive me, gentlemen?",
  "1657": "To what, ma'am?",
  "1658": "But how much truth was behind it?",
  "1659": "Ought we ever after to be considered as a part of the human race?",
  "1660": "What does it contain?",
  "1661": "Why should it break three inches from the top, as this one has done?",
  "1662": "Was it last evening that you came on board this vessel?",
  "1663": "Well, that wasn't very far, was it?",
  "1664": "And why not a bowl of rack punch as well as any other cause?",
  "1665": "Would it be some young man or other whom she takes an interest in?",
  "1666": "Is it absolutely necessary to go on with the letter, darling?",
  "1667": "Is that a genuine letter you are reading?",
  "1668": "What could be better?",
  "1669": "What has she been telling you?",
  "1670": "Why is that little, and the little freedom they enjoy, to be infringed?",
  "1671": "Had I been remanded to my dungeon, to await the next sacrifice, which would not take place for many months?",
  "1672": "Will she recover?",
  "1673": "And so you like this man's sisters, too, do you?",
  "1674": "Is that what you mean?",
  "1675": "What do you mean by going with other men, anyway?",
  "1676": "Where's the lecture room, d'you know?",
  "1677": "Why didn't you tell me, then?",
  "1678": "What would be the end?",
  "1679": "Feelin' sick?",
  "1680": "Determine on what?",
  "1681": "And yet what?",
  "1682": "Why risk the world's great empire for a punk?",
  "1683": "You mean, spend too much money?",
  "1684": "Shall, then, this bow take the life of many a chief among us, merely because you cannot bend it yourself?",
  "1685": "Nose and all?",
  "1686": "You desired a confessor?",
  "1687": "And will you answer it?",
  "1688": "How, then, will competition be harmoniously determined in society?",
  "1689": "Have I got to drink that stuff?",
  "1690": "Ruined her?",
  "1691": "So that I need not make use of this petition?",
  "1692": "But what do you conclude from that, father?",
  "1693": "What took place?",
  "1694": "Will you give your honour not to fire while we talk?",
  "1695": "What's the use of that?",
  "1696": "What's fame?",
  "1697": "Where would be the use of it?",
  "1698": "My purpose, for why should I deny it?",
  "1699": "Do you contradict me?",
  "1700": "What makes you so smitten with that little vermin?",
  "1701": "But how did you get in here?",
  "1702": "He had a son with him, hadn't he?",
  "1703": "Where was the man flying to after such dreadful retaliation?",
  "1704": "Why not still proceed over the untamed yet obedient element?",
  "1705": "Why then has he never taken part in public affairs?",
  "1706": "From that woman?",
  "1707": "Does not every merchant have his secret mark?",
  "1708": "And that others should approve of what we approve, is no miracle or impossibility?",
  "1709": "He will be a baronet, will he not?",
  "1710": "To what purpose?",
  "1711": "Can you pray?",
  "1712": "And can his majesty count upon many such subjects as yourself for his flight?",
  "1713": "What became of him?",
  "1714": "How many arms have you there ready for distribution?",
  "1715": "Will you come and see me?",
  "1716": "What makes you suppose I know?",
  "1717": "But what am I to do with the brute?",
  "1718": "What nonsense is this?",
  "1719": "Where was she now?",
  "1720": "Can't you find the cake?",
  "1721": "How do you explain the influence the count evidently possessed over those ruffians?",
  "1722": "What is the idea of you buying a fox skin, you poor beggar?",
  "1723": "Lost confidence?",
  "1724": "How could he have chosen a better friend in whom to trust?",
  "1725": "And did it believe, then, it had positively caught the redoubtable colonel?",
  "1726": "In the same way?",
  "1727": "What was your remark, my dear friend?",
  "1728": "Why do you answer me so roughly?",
  "1729": "What's going to become of us now?",
  "1730": "And what will the be the good of your going on after that?",
  "1731": "Is it right?",
  "1732": "Be terrorized by every prating paper?",
  "1733": "Are many of the young ladies with you?",
  "1734": "Oh, she thinks me too meek?",
  "1735": "Sparking plugs, eh?",
  "1736": "Was he alone, that long night, whose brave, loving spirit was bearing up, in that old shed, against buffeting and brutal stripes?",
  "1737": "I am out of all that, am I not?",
  "1738": "Why didn't yeh say so first?",
  "1739": "Have there not been religions indisputably on a moral level lower than that of the community which they represent?",

  "2169": "Who would use money and position better than he meant to use them?",
  "2170": "Run after it?",
  "2171": "Whose dog is it?",
  "2172": "And then, are you really acting according to your conscience, or are you acting in order to be admired of men?",
  "2173": "They had the sun to go by, certainly, when they started, but who could say how long it would last?",
  "2174": "Why ask us to do what you will not do yourselves?",
  "2175": "From companions in peril, would they not again be avowed rivals?",
  "2176": "Would you let me play your part for one night?",
  "2177": "And would he try to go beyond just action?",
  "2178": "Did you ever see such a handsome, strapping girl?",
  "2179": "What else have we been talking about?",
  "2180": "From where have you got them all?",
  "2181": "Who is the man?",
  "2182": "Who I, sir?",
  "2183": "Is it right to do men to death like this?",
  "2184": "Have ye shipped in her?",
  "2185": "It's a woman?",
  "2186": "Is its pattern strange to you?",
  "2187": "Your stepfather saved her?",
  "2188": "Can you help me find my way?",
  "2189": "Sir, said I, I hope you won't be angry, but, saving yourself, do you think they are painted worse than they deserve?",
  "2190": "Is not that verily a sanctifying of his holy name?",
  "2191": "And how about them?",
  "2192": "Nor exactly a bird?",
  "2193": "How am I mistaken in her?",
  "2194": "Did you marry three wives maybe?",
  "2195": "Do you wish me to give it up?",
  "2196": "Which is it you wish to hear?",
  "2197": "What talk is this of choosing?",
  "2198": "How shall I rhyme in this eternal roar?",
  "2199": "Any men that came along?",
  "2200": "Why not open my mind's eye for me?",
  "2201": "And whence did we obtain our knowledge?",
  "2202": "And pray what sort of guardians do you make?",
  "2203": "Never there?",
  "2204": "Do you see what I see?",
  "2205": "Or when he roasted it?",
  "2206": "What need that we should insults interchange?",
  "2207": "They don't look grave and mysterious, as if they had heard something strange?",
  "2208": "Why have you that silk frock on, then?",
  "2209": "Do you think about it?",
  "2210": "Isn't it so, lads?",
  "2211": "But suppose the wind were to sweep it off, so that he couldn't come back toward us?",
  "2212": "Who is it that calls?",
  "2213": "How could she do less for him than he was so anxious to do for her?",
  "2214": "No doubt he was in a pitiable position, but how could that be helped?",
  "2215": "You mean you really don't know?",
  "2216": "Have you not received any?",
  "2217": "What is changed?",
  "2218": "Why not be bestial, and go the whole round of experience?",
  "2219": "Have I upset you?",
  "2220": "How had she known that he it was, that is, that it was he?",
  "2221": "Did she fancy that he had meant to attack her with it?",
  "2222": "You remember, I said, how the rulers were chosen before?",
  "2223": "Do you think there is no weaker brother among all our lodges that could not be bought?",
  "2224": "And kill them?",
  "2225": "To fairs, markets, races, and so forth, I suppose?",
  "2226": "Why are YOU tramping?",
  "2227": "Am I to proceed in my work?",
  "2228": "Graduating well, you mean?",
  "2229": "Why is it that we hesitate?",
  "2230": "Or have you not begun to think about it yet?",
  "2231": "Surely by this time you ought to be able to understand something?",
  "2232": "Who are YOU in this establishment?",
  "2233": "Would not any decent soldier smite him across the face instead of grasping him by the hand?",
  "2234": "Lonely, like the devil, and envious like him?",
  "2235": "But how came he to have so singular a companion?",
  "2236": "Do I understand that he asked for more, after he had eaten the supper allotted by the dietary?",
  "2237": "Had he said anything to give himself away?",
  "2238": "Were they possibly the earth beating time?",
  "2239": "Was he poking fun, or not?",
  "2240": "What's the matter with this fellow?",
  "2241": "Sikes is not, I suppose?",
  "2242": "Why should I tell you what you cannot alter?",
  "2243": "Shall I go to her?",
  "2244": "Is he not, duke?",
  "2245": "And how old were you at that time?",
  "2246": "Why should we not all go?",
  "2247": "I ask what this pretended revolution has revolutionized?",
  "2248": "Do you suppose they keep vodka for sale?",
  "2249": "For how long a time?",
  "2250": "He could be neither of these things, for he had never heard of them, but do you think he is to be pitied for that?",
  "2251": "What makes you think so?",
  "2252": "I do not know, and what if I did?",
  "2253": "What is soon done, sir?",
  "2254": "Is that what you're waiting about for?",
  "2255": "How came ye to talk about that?",
  "2256": "There is a certain formidable machine, have you seen it?",
  "2257": "You hear, D'Artagnan?",
  "2258": "In other words, what are the most salient episodes and the most remarkable phases of the war between labor and capital?",
  "2259": "Ah, really?",
  "2260": "It would be a grand thing for one of those girls, wouldn't it?",
  "2261": "But how is it that you do these things?",
  "2262": "What is it about your pay?",
  "2263": "Had I not recognised that day, for the hundredth time, what I was worth?",
  "2264": "And you don't think me as handsome as your grandfather?",
  "2265": "Was this another hallucination?",
  "2266": "But, tell me, you have no one else staying here, have you?",
  "2267": "Do they display their charms merely to amuse them?",
  "2268": "Shall we use these, and so be even as to weapons?",
  "2269": "And why should you expect me to take you out riding?",
  "2270": "And what is it done in?",
  "2271": "What, then, are the conditions, the LAWS, of human society?",
  "2272": "Why not, indeed, seeing that at least it would have brought comfort to the poor people of this place?",
  "2273": "It was your play, I believe?",
  "2274": "Yes, monsieur, but once more, to what purpose are all these questions?",
  "2275": "And why now, my pretty simplicity?",
  "2276": "Besides, who knows?",
  "2277": "Why can't people take a line and stick to it?",
  "2278": "Which means, I suppose, that you refuse the service which I asked of you?",
  "2279": "Anything wrong?",
  "2280": "I suppose he can wait below?",
  "2281": "I suppose you have heard what's been happening to the beauty on the hill?",
  "2282": "Whose is that light which makes the eye to see perfectly and the visible to appear?",
  "2283": "The boys weep, and do you not think it is right that a father should weep?",
  "2284": "And what would he have done, the loafer, tell me, what would he have done?",
  "2285": "And what is doing?",
  "2286": "Is there a flood?",
  "2287": "How far had he walked?",
  "2288": "Your second brother?",
  "2289": "Because every one who may have anything to tell, you hold, will have been so squared?",
  "2290": "What was the use of sending for him?",
  "2291": "And where does he come from?",
  "2292": "What is it, duke?",
  "2293": "Pythangelus?",
  "2294": "I was going to ask, mama, before you were married, had you many suitors?",
  "2295": "Why should you hate the moon?",
  "2296": "Do you know the chapel?",
  "2297": "Who IS it?",
  "2298": "Where are all the eyes that heretofore watched me?",
  "2299": "Know you not, then, that your life is my life, and your death my death?",
  "2300": "Have you relatives?",
  "2301": "She may be free?",
  "2302": "Where is their road?",
  "2303": "Why not attack at once?",
  "2304": "What is allowed, then?",
  "2305": "Is she kind as she is fair?",
  "2306": "But where could such a hound lie concealed, where did it get its food, where did it come from, how was it that no one saw it by day?",
  "2307": "Have we made an erroneous interpretation of the document?",
  "2308": "Let me go on your bob?",
  "2309": "And what if I think to kill you now?",
  "2310": "And you will tell me this secret?",
  "2311": "Because we loved, and dared to say so, and even boasted of it?",
  "2312": "Is this body destined for such work?",
  "2313": "Your majesty is joking, have you not a million?",
  "2314": "Is there nothing you could take to give you present relief?",
  "2315": "Ought you to feel discouraged?",
  "2316": "To be sure, he who never liveth at the right time, how could he ever die at the right time?",
  "2317": "What will become of her now?",
  "2318": "What are you coming for?",
  "2319": "What's pretence?",
  "2320": "Hadn't I better play something?",
  "2321": "And why did you wish to see me?",
  "2322": "Call?",
  "2323": "Was it possible that we were on our way down through the mountains again?",
  "2324": "Well, what DO you know of him?",
  "2325": "A woman or an ape?",
  "2326": "Day?",
  "2327": "Who said I would not go?",
  "2328": "What was that?",
  "2329": "How is it he leaves me alone in my misery?",
  "2330": "What is the use of preserving slang?",
  "2331": "But what have I done to inspire you with such a feeling of thankfulness?",
  "2332": "You have, then, fulfilled my command, and composed a new interlude?",
  "2333": "The mysterious speaker?",
  "2334": "And how should I be able to recognize, and know, and designate by name what is strange to me, and what I have never before felt?",
  "2335": "No divisions?",
  "2336": "You don't mean you are coming with us?",
  "2337": "For your marriage?",
  "2338": "Did they want to kill you?",
  "2339": "Am I in the right?",
  "2340": "Brickmakers, eh?",
  "2341": "Well, what does it all mean?",
  "2342": "To anybody?",
  "2343": "What do you hope, then?",
  "2344": "Well, would you mind my reforming myself this afternoon?",
  "2345": "Then you know me?",
  "2346": "What about meals?",
  "2347": "ART SICK?",
  "2348": "And what did he do?",
  "2349": "And her brother?",
  "2350": "You have heerd tell of cotton rags dipt in turpentine, hav'nt you, how they produce combustion?",
  "2351": "But what appeal could it be?",
  "2352": "Wrong?",
  "2353": "Do you want me to tell everything?",
  "2354": "Rob suggested?",
  "2355": "And is the soul in agreement with the affections of the body?",
  "2356": "Would you like this room, sir?",
  "2357": "What do I hear?",
  "2358": "Shall I stop the boat and try to get you out here?",
  "2359": "And are you prepared to meet the cost?",
  "2360": "You?",
  "2361": "Markova?",
  "2362": "You haven't any place to go, have you?",
  "2363": "What is there for us?",
  "2364": "Besides, shall we not bear the lords of the habitable earth to be lords over us, and yet bear tyrants of our own country?",
  "2365": "When, and in what month?",
  "2366": "But what are we to do with him?",
  "2367": "Why can you not bear them?",
  "2368": "I wonder if all the things move along with us?",
  "2369": "Why this negation, if a modification was sufficient?",
  "2370": "Was this idolized parent still in existence?",
  "2371": "Who follows me?",
  "2372": "But how in the name of all that's wonderful does he GET OUT?",
  "2373": "Could the professor throw any light upon that?",
  "2374": "Can't we be good friends?",
  "2375": "Could it be possible that the sense of unreality in which he felt himself imprisoned had communicated itself to his wife?",
  "2376": "Why alas?",
  "2377": "What do you mean by that, monsieur?",
  "2378": "After having met with so many who promised, when shall I find one who will give?",
  "2379": "What the deuce are you talking about?",
  "2380": "Coffins, where?",
  "2381": "You are not in debt, then?",
  "2382": "Why should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice of the people?",
  "2383": "I love you, I?",
  "2384": "Surely there is no necessity for you to say one word, mama?",
  "2385": "That's eight months she has been away, surely?",
  "2386": "Who shall go in?",
  "2387": "Will you sell them for five francs?",
  "2388": "Why negotiate, and above all why retreat, when to retreat is so contrary to his method of conducting war?",
  "2389": "You wanted to speak to her?",
  "2390": "But am I not your nearest relative?",
  "2391": "Then what do you think, mother, has become of 'em?",
  "2392": "You have written to your father?",
  "2393": "Ought it not?",
  "2394": "Did he tell you so himself?",
  "2395": "The ladies are great observers, sir?",
  "2396": "Are you come to do anything in my way, sir?",
  "2397": "Have you honours?",
  "2398": "I may marry somebody when I grow up but I'm far too young to be thinking of it yet, don't you think, teacher?",
  "2399": "Suppose, now, I could give you up to a rich man who would be able to insure you against all wants?",
  "2400": "If so, why is it not among his papers?",
  "2401": "What's your name, portress?",
  "2402": "How big is this hole?",
  "2403": "Jest t' pull me along outer th' road?",
  "2404": "Hear you how they are sawing and hammering there below?",
  "2405": "Don't ye love sperm?",
  "2406": "Now what say you to aluminum, gentlemen?",
  "2407": "How much am I worth?",
  "2408": "And the cards I ordered to be engraved as soon as you knew the number of the house?",
  "2409": "What put that in your head?",
  "2410": "Had she never looked for the door?",
  "2411": "Everything?",
  "2412": "Do you think he will object to it?",
  "2413": "What think you of such a song as this?",
  "2414": "Have they not heard that of their colonel?",
  "2415": "Who was the gentleman?",
  "2416": "How could he have me in view, and not be aware of it himself?",
  "2417": "What is your name?",
  "2418": "How did I take to it?",
  "2419": "And she is getting on well, you say?",
  "2420": "Have you anything to ask, sire, before we part?",
  "2421": "Are you mad?",
  "2422": "And what does it mean?",
  "2423": "Now, then, who are you?",
  "2424": "Why do I wish to unite you two?",
  "2425": "Do I look like a sweep, then?",
  "2426": "Why, how fail to understand?",
  "2427": "You understand me?",
  "2428": "Brownlow, I believe, sir?",
  "2429": "Why have I always to complain of you?",
  "2430": "But you killed nobody yourselves?",
  "2431": "Why do you pity them?",
  "2432": "Yes, but could not the mistake be rectified?",
  "2433": "What is the matter, said he, my chicken?",
  "2434": "Am I not to know to whom to present it?",
  "2435": "I say, madam, what do you propose to do with these papers?",
  "2436": "Yes, d'you want anything?",
  "2437": "Are we ready?",
  "2438": "Have you any better explanation?",
  "2439": "Who was it gave me that rogues' march from the stocks to the gallows's foot?",
  "2440": "Why, pray?",
  "2441": "Now could I speak of that which is not yet?",
  "2442": "What is the proprietor?",
  "2443": "Would you mind stepping in for a moment?",
  "2444": "Shall I say yes or shall I say no?",
  "2445": "What should you be out of spirits for?",
  "2446": "Do you always want to be fooled?",
  "2447": "At this last moment I ask you, have we not long been betrothed to each other in our secret hearts?",
  "2448": "Ripping, isn't it?",
  "2449": "If you hadn't a been dogged, where'd you a been now?",
  "2450": "When did this happen?",
  "2451": "Something about somebody laughing at a locksmith?",
  "2452": "For what are you fighting?",
  "2453": "And that is adding insult to injury, is it?",
  "2454": "And where will I look for 'em?",
  "2455": "Or failed to do anything you ordered?",
  "2456": "Gentlemen, is that a true view of the case?",
  "2457": "It was with a hilted knife maybe?",
  "2458": "Was he really doing everything that could be expected of him?",
  "2459": "How fare ye?",
  "2460": "What noise was that?",
  "2461": "But will the person who shall accompany you afterward be a man or a woman?",
  "2462": "Yes, but how am I to give it up?",
  "2463": "We may depend on you?",
  "2464": "Does it really seem so to you?",
  "2465": "You've been tramping in the sun, and it's a very warm night, and hadn't you better sleep over the notion?",
  "2466": "And you really live by the river?",
  "2467": "Shall not the grief of the old time follow?",
  "2468": "Couldn't you manage to hold me in your arms?",
  "2469": "Isn't he very rich?",
  "2470": "Some authentic relic?",
  "2471": "Why are you not at work?",
  "2472": "Why did I suddenly loose my grip of her?",
  "2473": "Sure you did?",
  "2474": "Sylvestre?",
  "2475": "An't that as nat'ral as a sheep's bleating, or a pig's grunting, or a horse's neighing, or a bird's singing?",
  "2476": "Was it a kind of adoration for so much purity?",
  "2477": "It would have embarrassed what?",
  "2478": "Would you prefer a more humble life, a life more suited to your strength?",
  "2479": "What he?",
  "2480": "What did you suppose, then?",
  "2481": "Did we not finish it?",
  "2482": "Will you be mine?",
  "2483": "He did not proceed to blows?",
  "2484": "What else had she herself meant three minutes before by speaking of her as great?",
  "2485": "Why has the legislator given hands to this conspiracy of monopolies, to this interdict upon theories belonging to all?",
  "2486": "And do you suppose it weighs on him any less than on you?",
  "2487": "Do you wish these proofs, these attestations, which I alone possess, to be destroyed?",
  "2488": "Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?",
  "2489": "You do not like?",
  "2490": "You are going to be married?",
  "2491": "And will you, sir, get your living by the counsel of traitors?",
  "2492": "Wot job?",
  "2493": "What happened in the house?",
  "2494": "Why do you not ask the fisherman for his cutlass?",
  "2495": "Have you forgotten, my lord, that it is he who answered for me to the queen?",
  "2496": "If harm befell him, what would be our fate?",
  "2497": "You mark me sir?",
  "2498": "And what would you yourself say?",
  "2499": "Do you think, gentlemen, that I look like an innkeeper?",
  "2500": "Did you ever see him?",
  "2501": "And yet you say he is not a medical student?",
  "2502": "Are there children or are there not?",
  "2503": "What is he?",
  "2504": "Where have they been put?",
  "2505": "How does my sweet lady?",
  "2506": "And what was his purpose?",
  "2507": "Ah, you know it?",
  "2508": "Why don't they jump in and destroy these fliers?",
  "2509": "But with a beard, you tell me?",
  "2510": "But, on the other hand, whose blood was that which lay so thickly upon the floor?",
  "2511": "Well, what did you see, sir, or think you saw?",
  "2512": "What was taking place within him?",
  "2513": "You love me, don't you?",
  "2514": "What did you force me to run away with you for?",
  "2515": "Did I groan all right?",
  "2516": "Known what?",
  "2517": "You, my poor child, suffer poverty and hunger?",
  "2518": "Was it by his extensive knowledge, by his exquisite judgment, or by his heroic valour?",
  "2519": "Whose language would he speak?",
  "2520": "Yer powers wasn't enough to carry 'ee through?",
  "2521": "Perhaps you would care to try?",
  "2522": "Why should he change his name in a country where no one knew his original one?",
  "2523": "What can it know about the matter?",
  "2524": "Shall we begin education with music, and go on to gymnastic afterwards?",
  "2525": "Shall we try it?",
  "2526": "I hope I have not driven her away?",
  "2527": "Where does he come in?",
  "2528": "Why have you hatched these vipers which, when they shall have grown, will inflict injury on all, beginning with yourself?",
  "2529": "What have I seen?",
  "2530": "Am not I dreaming?",
  "2531": "Am I to say what you told me?",
  "2532": "What could be more just?",
  "2533": "How many shots?",
  "2534": "Why did he leave?",
  "2535": "Well, and what then?",
  "2536": "Do you pity him?",
  "2537": "To be cased up and hung by on the wall?",
  "2538": "Sword?",
  "2539": "You heard what I said to the prince?",
  "2540": "What's to be done?",
  "2541": "Are there any good men?",
  "2542": "Diminish public burdens, assess taxes on a more equitable basis?",
  "2543": "Who can deny that one's physical conditions determine one's character or personality?",
  "2544": "How am I to know?",
  "2545": "I have sent for three of my friends, but who knows whether they were at home?",
  "2546": "A qui cette voiture la?",
  "2547": "Or when he gathered it?",
  "2548": "I say, aren't we much too soon?",
  "2549": "Do you like it?",
  "2550": "And who is there that will either take the trouble or incur the odium, of a strict scrunity into the secret springs of the transaction?",
  "2551": "Are the other children in bed?",
  "2552": "Does he make it against that newspaper editor merely?",
  "2553": "Why torture me now?",
  "2554": "Abideth there husband for me, after the son of my uncle?",
  "2555": "Or have you dined?",
  "2556": "Cur aliquid vidi?",
  "2557": "Or, was he?",
  "2558": "Had you ever seen it before?",
  "2559": "Have I positive and substantive proof of what I assert?",
  "2560": "How could you let it go so?",
  "2561": "Why should I look at the letter?",
  "2562": "Won't you please be good enough to send my tea into the library?",
  "2563": "But how did it turn out with me?",
  "2564": "You won't want another dog, will you?",
  "2565": "The prosecutor was reading, was he?",
  "2566": "Well, sirs, is everybody here?",
  "2567": "How are they when you've done?",
  "2568": "And you are still satisfied?",
  "2569": "How shall I understand you?",
  "2570": "But what do the young woman say herself about it?",
  "2571": "And will you tell me what you read therein, monseigneur?",
  "2572": "Would it not be a wilful throwing away of a chance not to avail himself of it?",
  "2573": "Pray, sir, what is the soul?",
  "2574": "The child, my child?",
  "2575": "Wot do you want to throw 'im over for?",
  "2576": "I say, what are we going to do?",
  "2577": "Stubbs?",

  "4664": "How's this?",
  "4665": "Why do you say more often?",
  "4666": "Why, do you mean to say you couldn't have done it, if you had chosen?",
  "4667": "And how he knows me?",
  "4668": "Wickfield?",
  "4669": "But what good will rhythms do me for a living?",
  "4670": "Ben who?",
  "4671": "What do you tell me, child?",
  "4672": "You villain, will you finish?",
  "4673": "What do you say to that, doctor?",
  "4674": "Was that a mistake?",
  "4675": "D' you suppose I can't die like a gentleman?",
  "4676": "Tell me then truly, have I really got back to my own country?",
  "4677": "Is it there?",
  "4678": "What do you think of that?",
  "4679": "How was it?",
  "4680": "May I inquire who you are, and what is your business?",
  "4681": "If people are so silly as to indulge the sentiment, is it my fault?",
  "4682": "Where shall the weary soldier find his rest?",
  "4683": "Whom have you chosen to give you your cues?",
  "4684": "Shakespeare's sonnets?",
  "4685": "Slight, how will you do then?",
  "4686": "And it was they who told you something which made you angry?",
  "4687": "Why don't you be happy as well?",
  "4688": "Why do they use bronze for swords and spears, iron for tools?",
  "4689": "You see, do you not?",
  "4690": "What was the use of all these planks and boards?",
  "4691": "Then two are cheaper than one?",
  "4692": "Do you know, my dear fellow, why master pastrycooks never work with their hands?",
  "4693": "A secret of such a nature as to change his majesty's interests?",
  "4694": "Will you go, mother?",
  "4695": "Not listening?",
  "4696": "From me, then?",
  "4697": "Whom do you expect to find with me at this hour?",
  "4698": "Who told you, then, that the cardinal was dead?",
  "4699": "What then can we say of these prophets, but that they are impostors and liars?",
  "4700": "But if you direct us to apply to her excellency, would you graciously oblige us with her address?",
  "4701": "How did you find that they are now wise?",
  "4702": "Is it not rather far?",
  "4703": "But is there inner life expressed, or possible to be expressed, in any other form save physical organism?",
  "4704": "Of course they answer to their names?",
  "4705": "And was that it?",
  "4706": "Nothing?",
  "4707": "Alone, or with her husband?",
  "4708": "Will this prove it more?",
  "4709": "What use were anger and protestations against her silly credulity?",
  "4710": "Do you think it would content him, could he see me branding cattle and bargaining with bullock drivers?",
  "4711": "But, perhaps you have a better understanding of these things?",
  "4712": "After you've refused him?",
  "4713": "Come, shall we go?",
  "4714": "Do you hear the news?",
  "4715": "But where does one find it nowadays?",
  "4716": "Is your hand steady enough to write?",
  "4717": "She said she'd keep it safe, did she?",
  "4718": "Do you think that could be anything to a man who has struck down seven at one blow?",
  "4719": "Who is yon stranger clad all in scarlet?",
  "4720": "Would you wish the gentleman to be shown in, ma'am?",
  "4721": "Are you fond of pictures, dear?",
  "4722": "Is it quite fair to this young woman's memory to read at such length to a stranger what was intended for your eye alone?",
  "4723": "Or peace?",
  "4724": "So that's my young cousin, is it?",
  "4725": "You can do what you please when you go out, can't you?",
  "4726": "They?",
  "4727": "But could I do with a million?",
  "4728": "Would he allow himself to accept from any woman that of which she had stripped herself?",
  "4729": "Why had he not put them out for good?",
  "4730": "Because you are a fool must you die like a mouse under his foot?",
  "4731": "At home?",
  "4732": "Can you tell me what it is?",
  "4733": "Shall I ever forget the look which came over his face when the first warning pangs told him that the poison was in his system?",
  "4734": "Have I not always been ready to help you in word and deed, so far as it lay in my power?",
  "4735": "Where did you get the mark upon your forehead?",
  "4736": "Why do you shave your beard?",
  "4737": "Or is it not rather merely a repetition of the question?",
  "4738": "When did you come in?",
  "4739": "Didn't he owe us immense sums, all round?",
  "4740": "You are married, sir, I am told?",
  "4741": "And where was other aid to be found?",
  "4742": "Well, what about his assistants?",
  "4743": "And now what are we to do now?",
  "4744": "Who went out this morning?",
  "4745": "I understand that I wait for you under all circumstances?",
  "4746": "Is the way blocked?",
  "4747": "Who are the wizards?",
  "4748": "And you won't feel ashamed to write to him?",
  "4749": "Does he show any turn for any musical instrument?",
  "4750": "Do you think the family will stand for me?",
  "4751": "Who told you that I had not married her?",
  "4752": "What, you can begin to shed tears and offer me your hand?",
  "4753": "Who told you so?",
  "4754": "Men at all?",
  "4755": "Shall I send for another bottle?",
  "4756": "For surely, sir, you will not assert, that a duty can be binding which is not founded on reason?",
  "4757": "Is he going to steal the letters to submit them to somebody ashore?",
  "4758": "Is a democracy, such as we know it, the last improvement possible in government?",
  "4759": "Does that make any impression on your mind?",
  "4760": "Does he not say he will not strike his spars to any gale?",
  "4761": "Afraid?",
  "4762": "Where is the harm?",
  "4763": "What, do you still doubt, sire?",
  "4764": "Has tha' never seen them?",
  "4765": "For did he not take me when I was poor and naked?",
  "4766": "Well, will you judge between us?",
  "4767": "By what?",
  "4768": "But what can a monarchical talker say?",
  "4769": "Another turn, eh?",
  "4770": "So you are quite alone?",
  "4771": "Did they find the charm?",
  "4772": "My watch?",
  "4773": "Can you make that out?",
  "4774": "Oh, why must a man like that be made unhappy when there are lots of girls about who would worship the very ground he trod on?",
  "4775": "It's quite hot even now, isn't it?",
  "4776": "How can you bear, when you are borne yourself?",
  "4777": "What door would be closed to him?",
  "4778": "How do you know?",
  "4779": "Had he done well in that?",
  "4780": "Or, perhaps a little cordial?",
  "4781": "Do you now see that it was not he but I who moved you?",
  "4782": "Anybody hurt?",
  "4783": "Have you a family?",
  "4784": "Can't you splice it?",
  "4785": "Could not a man take a chirping bottle with you to taste your wine?",
  "4786": "Will you stop a moment and think over these words?",
  "4787": "Have you seen my mother?",
  "4788": "Well, and what do you see?",
  "4789": "Could he not see the danger he had run?",
  "4790": "When will what be?",
  "4791": "Have you made up your mind, my dear?",
  "4792": "Who then?",
  "4793": "What did I go and tell a lie for?",
  "4794": "Do you know the contents of this note, sir?",
  "4795": "But what are they to do?",
  "4796": "Why doesn't somebody start a yeoman party in politics, appealing to the old traditions of the small landowner?",
  "4797": "It's HIS daughter, is it?",
  "4798": "Why on earth should you wish that?",
  "4799": "Has he anything remarkable about him by which one may recognize him?",
  "4800": "Is he the author?",
  "4801": "You said just now you came hither to study topography?",
  "4802": "When will she be at length relieved from the burden of her royal crown?",
  "4803": "Why, why?",
  "4804": "Do you remember the story of that man in the hospital?",
  "4805": "And the avaricious, I said, is the oligarchical youth?",
  "4806": "Until some one rare and grand result is reached which may be good, and may be the reverse of good?",
  "4807": "Hey?",
  "4808": "Have you had that youngster with you long?",
  "4809": "Is he not rich enough to keep the estate in good order?",
  "4810": "What will he want with me?",
  "4811": "Not alone, are you?",
  "4812": "Wolves, jaguars, or apes?",
  "4813": "He said he knew them well enough, but what was there in that?",
  "4814": "But is it not a heavy load?",
  "4815": "Why wait here for the divorce?",
  "4816": "Disappointment?",
  "4817": "And have your notions changed?",
  "4818": "How shall we dare to think well of ourselves again?",
  "4819": "What of the country's people?",
  "4820": "We men are determined, nay, are we not pledged, to destroy this monster?",
  "4821": "A geographer would be of much use to our expedition, and what can be nobler than to bring science to the service of humanity?",
  "4822": "How on earth could any reasonable man expect a girl to let herself go at this stage of the proceedings?",
  "4823": "How do you manage?",
  "4824": "No pudding?",
  "4825": "Don't you reckon that the people that made the books knows what's the correct thing to do?",
  "4826": "Is he as young and handsome as uncle?",
  "4827": "Have you not eyes in your head?",
  "4828": "Would you suppose him to have a head and a heart full of romance yet?",
  "4829": "And not to use such expressions?",
  "4830": "What else could it have meant?",
  "4831": "All ready are you, my boy?",
  "4832": "What d'you think of me?",
  "4833": "Madeline, who is this?",
  "4834": "And you are sure she can get home?",
  "4835": "It HAS been a delightful evening, hasn't it?",
  "4836": "If you are such a scholar as to pitch yer hopes so high as that, why not give us a specimen of your scholarship?",
  "4837": "Ain't you?",
  "4838": "Now you, young prince, what's your name?",
  "4839": "What matters who sees me now?",
  "4840": "You have made the will, you round world of love?",
  "4841": "Have I done any wrong?",
  "4842": "And should also be given some supper, I suppose?",
  "4843": "You understand?",
  "4844": "How is the count?",
  "4845": "Not only so, but if you were to do so, how long would it take the courts to hold your votes unconstitutional and void?",
  "4846": "Why were you so scared of me?",
  "4847": "Is he ill?",
  "4848": "What are you doing here?",

  "4855": "Why does nobody come?",
  "4856": "Are you so new in the world as not to know?",
  "4857": "Why are you like this?",
  "4858": "Which are the muscles which subdivide in old age or in youth, when becoming lean?",
  "4859": "How could it ever have happened then?",
  "4860": "And, pray, how do you know that?",
  "4861": "Did you see her often?",
  "4862": "Then you are an old friend, I suppose?",

  "4952": "And what are the elementary principles, we may ask, that compose human strength?",
  "4953": "Or if it were, is an exception to a general rule in every case criminal, for no other reason than because it is an exception?",
  "4954": "What did I make him do?",
  "4955": "Why then has he declined the only thing that was worth while to write upon?",
  "4956": "What is it, and then I will tell you?",
  "4957": "Is it so stupid?",
  "4958": "But tell me, ye men, who of you are capable of friendship?",

  "4976": "You don't think that I and my son are other than gentlemen?",
  "4977": "Yesterday morning?",
  "4978": "What is that empty coffin?",
  "4979": "How is it that I am writing to you?",
  "4980": "Do you suppose I don't see the line you've taken up with your wife?",
  "4981": "You and he had searched for it together there, hadn't you?",
  "4982": "And now what is it that you came to me to say?",
  "4983": "Then the gentleman is going on terra firma?",
  "4984": "To famish apart?",
  "4985": "Bevan?",
  "4986": "Do you like fish?",

  "5002": "What do you require?",
  "5003": "But if in your case some of these imprisoned forces were used, what set them free at the opportune time, or how?",
  "5004": "What do we do now usually in a great battle?",
  "5005": "But can you recognize him?",
  "5006": "Harris?",
  "5007": "What would he say?",

  "5022": "Is who dead, dear boy?",
  "5023": "Why should it be she?",
  "5024": "Can a mother speak like that?",
  "5025": "Do you mean to say you've managed to get anybody?",
  "5026": "And how about your luggage?",
  "5027": "You have, then, seen something?",
  "5028": "Would you like to come and see?",
  "5029": "How, then, was she to help herself among the proud and determined nobles of her court?",
  "5030": "Why can't the widow get back her silver snuffbox that was stole?",
  "5031": "So, then?",
  "5032": "Should this power depend on strength of understanding alone?",
  "5033": "Have you the dates of those letters?",
  "5034": "Where has she run off to?",
  "5035": "Pals?",
  "5036": "Is it your wish to kill yourself?",

  "7582": "Why is there an allusion to that cursed 'poor knight' in the anonymous letter?",
  "7583": "Didn't he get the telegram?",
  "7584": "Don't you call to mind what he says?",
  "7585": "And what sort of young lady is she?",
  "7586": "Has a duplicate key been found in his possession?",
  "7587": "Didn't you feel the ground shake?",
  "7588": "How will you travel?",
  "7589": "How many did they say?",
  "7590": "You are not convinced yet?",
  "7591": "Have you provided yourself with money?",
  "7592": "I'm rather on the spot this evening, eh?",
  "7593": "Did she see you?",
  "7594": "Do people die of it?",
  "7595": "I suppose there is nothing to prevent it?",
  "7596": "Did not my neck glitter with diamonds?",
  "7597": "How comes it?",
  "7598": "How otherwise should I have been bad enough?",
  "7599": "You do not reply?",
  "7600": "Then would you call injustice malignity?",
  "7601": "Which will conquer?",
  "7602": "Well, what did the king say?",
  "7603": "Are you sure you're quite so much as six foot three?",
  "7604": "And why, may I ask?",
  "7605": "But we have grain belonging to my brother?",
  "7606": "Do ye love brandy?",

  "7616": "What's the matter aloft there?",
  "7617": "Should war break out in any of those countries who can foretell the extent to which it may be carried or the desolation which it may spread?",

  "7624": "And what the devil do you wake me for?",
  "7625": "So you've got back?",
  "7626": "Then why don't you turn her out?",
  "7627": "Why should he go to a play if he enjoys it so little?",
  "7628": "Was it an angel's voice?",
  "7629": "Why, then, had he come hither?",
  "7630": "What was his version?",
  "7631": "Yet what good end can all this superficial counsel produce?",
  "7632": "What's the report of this boy?",
  "7633": "Take a glass of wine?",
  "7634": "And what has become of that scoundrel?",
  "7635": "But, what will you do?",
  "7636": "Are you coming down and fight fair?",
  "7637": "But what is the meaning of all this?",
  "7638": "Where be the dogs?",

  "7645": "What can they mean?",
  "7646": "He has had punch already, has he not, sir?",
  "7647": "Shall you come down in the world for want of this letter about your son?",
  "7648": "So, then, you must leave us?",
  "7649": "But at any rate I have shown, have I not, that there is a certain element of improbability about the lady's story?",

  "7651": "Has he got any?",
  "7652": "Are they friendly to us, do you think?",
  "7653": "Me alone?",
  "7654": "And you allow then, sir, that spheres exist, and that these marked and invisible beings mingle amongst us?",
  "7655": "Who knows if they will not manage to restore to me my pension?",
  "7656": "Poodle?",
  "7657": "Is she dead?",
  "7658": "But were you not on horseback?",
  "7659": "Is the countess up yet?",
  "7660": "Then this young man escaped with you?",
  "7661": "Where are my armies, my troops, my treasures?",
  "7662": "Canler?",
  "7663": "Do you belong to the number of the happy or of the miserable?",
  "7664": "But why couldn't he let me know?",
  "7665": "Will you promise to be quiet, and not kick up a fuss if I get you something to eat?",
  "7666": "And they not rich?",
  "7667": "In the rouge way?",
  "7668": "She did not resist, for what could she do?",

  "7674": "Why surprised?",
  "7675": "What are you kicking up this row for?",
  "7676": "Yet are you not sorry for fellows of that stamp?",
  "7677": "What if he turns against the others?",
  "7678": "For is not my lord the son of a king?",
  "7679": "Why is it so long?",
  "7680": "Will he even pay me for his lodging?",
  "7681": "A mistake?",
  "7682": "Shall any man hate me?",
  "7683": "Two figures?",
  "7684": "What will dart out presently?",
  "7685": "Does he regret me a little?",
  "7686": "How do you look at the question?",

  "7693": "Is this your pupil?",
  "7694": "And what, pray, WAS the price?",
  "7695": "How is it with you?",
  "7696": "What o'clock is it?",
  "7697": "Surely the writer does not mean that a pleasant or delectable island would not be fit for breeding horses?",
  "7698": "You are a good temper?",
  "7699": "Had the crew seen me disappear?",
  "7700": "Don't you think we will?",
  "7701": "Now, do you understand me?",
  "7702": "How many times will I have to speak of this matter?",
  "7703": "On your arm?",
  "7704": "I understand, however, from the inquest that there were some objects which you failed to overlook?",
  "7705": "Why don't you go and get it then?",
  "7706": "Where are the graces of my soul?",
  "7707": "Do you know, sir, said she, that her ladyship intends to be down here with you in a few days?",
  "7708": "What is the meaning of this hunt, skipper?",
  "7709": "Why, had you no unicorn's horn, nor bezoar's stone about you, ha?",
  "7710": "Did you really think me capable of that?",
  "7711": "How do you like her, my dear?",
  "7712": "Shall I sure?",

  "7717": "Whose portraits are those?",
  "7718": "What was the subject of these singular conversations?",
  "7719": "Is it a check to the action of the individual?",
  "7720": "She is melancholy, then?",
  "7721": "Have you noticed THAT THEY WON'T LET ANY ONE TOUCH THEM?",
  "7722": "What sympathy should a holy preacher have with either?",
  "7723": "Is is a bargain?",
  "7724": "Would not your excellency like a little refreshment?",
  "7725": "So, then, they have paid my ransom?",
  "7726": "Well, mademoiselle, what are you thinking about, standing there like a statue?",
  "7727": "Will you undertake the task?",
  "7728": "Tell me, will you do this for me, and cease to weep?",
  "7729": "Come, how much?",
  "7730": "Do you know, sir, that you are asking me very strange questions, and that I am very foolish to answer them?",
  "7731": "Shall I climb the magnolia?",
  "7732": "What becomes of them?",
  "7733": "You aren't angry, are you?",

  "7746": "Then what?",
  "7747": "Do you mean to say you have had my cigarette case all this time?",
  "7748": "Won't you come along with me?",
  "7749": "What do we mean when we say that one man isn't to be trusted as another?",
  "7750": "What shall we do then?",
  "7751": "Jean, do you think that I am quite mad?",
  "7752": "Why is not her joy complete?",

  "7844": "You have not allowed him to penetrate your secret, then?",
  "7845": "You keep it on?",
  "7846": "Or are they digging side by side on different lines?",

  "10911": "What sort of cloth is it?",
  "10912": "How does the mortal world go?",
  "10913": "What are you going to say?",
  "10914": "But you can sleep when you please, monsieur?",
  "10915": "Will you be quiet?",
  "10916": "But what extraordinary tumult do I hear?",
  "10917": "But what did you say?",
  "10918": "Doctor, am I not to go with you?",
  "10919": "These volcanoes, however, were at one time in a state of activity?",
  "10920": "Disturbed her?",
  "10921": "Why do you attribute to me a wish for anything that would annoy you?",
  "10922": "She's got no money, you mean?",
  "10923": "Could something have happened out there to keep her away?",
  "10924": "Who'll look after you on this ship?",
  "10925": "Won't you first?",
  "10926": "The cargo on board?",
  "10927": "Why will they leave us some regret?",
  "10928": "Ah, your favourites are among these?",
  "10929": "Why, did not I tell you she had been stolen from me?",
  "10930": "When, oh when, would his new clothes be ready?",
  "10931": "Say when shall it be?",
  "10932": "Would it be to promote emancipation?",
  "10933": "What is thy need, master?",
  "10934": "Or is it the death of some dear friend that has disturbed his mind?",
  "10935": "You see that it is necessary that he should pay us a visit, don't you?",
  "10936": "Why is it that we see no therns?",

  "10940": "Why is she wandering alone through these mountains?",
  "10941": "Was it indeed a house of death to which I had come, too late?",
  "10942": "Where is that?",
  "10943": "And those who govern ought not to be lovers of the task?",
  "10944": "Why should a man like you go about telling lies in this way?",

  "10972": "Do you think I could forget that?",
  "10973": "Where does this diligence run?",
  "10974": "Why fight at all?",
  "10975": "But whence might this woman have meat and drink, and how could her sustenance last out to her for three years and more?",
  "10976": "Do you think she wants to order something of him?",
  "10977": "Did you never hear talk of a young woman who was carried off one night?",
  "10978": "Should he climb the other ridge, or wander along the hollow?",
  "10979": "You do not mean that they have sent him to prison?",
  "10980": "Why don't they come?",
  "10981": "How did he manage to buy this house?",
  "10982": "Was it a knell for his lost soul, chasing him through the empty streets and beginning already an eternal punishment of terror?",
  "10983": "What was he doing during that time?",
  "10984": "What is to be settled?",
  "10985": "Do you mean of dislike?",
  "10986": "If that is not a horror, what is?",
  "10987": "Who knows but this may be deemed right below?",
  "10988": "Can't we go some other way?",
  "10989": "The sentiment is strong, then?",
  "10990": "Is your soul alive?",
  "10991": "Wildeve?",
  "10992": "And so you would explode confirmation and marriage altogether?",
  "10993": "You think I may hope?",
  "10994": "The red ratafia, does your ladyship mean, or the cherry brandy?",
  "10995": "But who were thy confederates in this?",
  "10996": "Do you know the young man?",
  "10997": "What means he, sir?",
  "10998": "May not this be said to redeem and gain time with a vengeance, think you?",
  "10999": "Who set you the tasks?",
  "11000": "What is that, said they?",
  "11001": "You think a great deal about the improvement of youth?",
  "11002": "You've relieved your feelings?",
  "11003": "What good?",
  "11004": "Will that ever be?",
  "11005": "Don't you know that type of man?",

  "11012": "My husband?",
  "11013": "What's this about the girl you say is leaving?",
  "11014": "And the wager?",
  "11015": "Can you guess what it is?",
  "11016": "How say you now?",
  "11017": "Wouldn't it be much better if you went to bed?",
  "11018": "Morrel, can you intend it in my house, under my very eyes?",
  "11019": "Why shouldn't I go?",
  "11020": "Why should he have got into any argument about the validity of these orders?",
  "11021": "What have you done to the man?",
  "11022": "Do you notice how it exalts everything?",
  "11023": "Think it?",
  "11024": "What good is it?",
  "11025": "Is it you?",
  "11026": "You approve of my going away for years, then, and never coming here again till I have made myself of some mark in the world?",
  "11027": "They've conquered everybody, and why am I to be pleased at that?",
  "11028": "What's that you wouldn't tell, mother?",
  "11029": "In this emergency what are the contending parties doing?",
  "11030": "Must they devour each other?",
  "11031": "What do you say, mother?",
  "11032": "Is it wrong to watch the kingfisher seeking his nest?",
  "11033": "Where are you going to now?",
  "11034": "We're on the right track, I think?",
  "11035": "Is he, indeed?",
  "11036": "You would not inform?",
  "11037": "There is such a person, then?",
  "11038": "Who in this universe?",
  "11039": "Or who would with any patience hear his friends, if they should presume to defend his government as not arbitrary and tyrannical?",
  "11040": "Yes, don't you like this quarter?",
  "11041": "And you can't remember the number of the house?",
  "11042": "Once more, he said, what ruler is there of the elements of human nature other than the soul, and especially the wise soul?",
  "11043": "Then why not be more careful than him?",
  "11044": "You esteem her, sir?",
  "11045": "You are going to verify THAT?",
  "11046": "And yet?",
  "11047": "Get my letter?",
  "11048": "Why this great sin?",

  "11050": "Why is there so little fate in your looks?",
  "11051": "S'pose she dug him up and didn't find nothing, what would she think of me?",
  "11052": "Mind, my darling?",
  "11053": "What part would they want me to take?",
  "11054": "And has your business been attended to in your absence?",
  "11055": "He's there, is he?",
  "11056": "I may use that freedom with your name?",
  "11057": "Chops, eh?",
  "11058": "Postponed for good, I hope?",

  "11063": "Why did I myself keep it from you?",
  "11064": "And that cursed projectile has fallen?",
  "11065": "But how could you so blind her?",
  "11066": "Would he who could gain such a prize crave other riches his whole life long?",
  "11067": "And is it any better with the gentry?",
  "11068": "How can you be such a naughty boy and your poor mother just laid in her grave this very day?",
  "11069": "Jussac, one of the first swordsmen in the kingdom?",
  "11070": "Helena, do you love my son?",
  "11071": "Shall we refuse them?",
  "11072": "How do you know how he behaves?",
  "11073": "All round the town?",
  "11074": "Where is the relation between the cause supposed and the effect obtained?",
  "11075": "What does it mean?",
  "11076": "What could be the matter with the handsome fellow?",
  "11077": "Will that content you?",
  "11078": "What had caused it?",
  "11079": "Ay?",
  "11080": "Can I believe my ears?",
  "11081": "Yet, would they meet again?",

  "11086": "What is NOT the matter?",
  "11087": "I understand that it was on a professional matter that you wished to speak to me?",
  "11088": "Who says so?",
  "11089": "How about your letters?",
  "11090": "Are you there?",
  "11091": "You mean that you want to get away from me, after I've been to all the trouble and expense of teaching you the business?",
  "11092": "Moreover, what is an obscure corner in such a submersion of joy?",
  "11093": "And who told you?",
  "11094": "What do we know about what she feels?",
  "11095": "Will he know from use whether or no his drawing is correct or beautiful?",

  "11108": "Why are we brought here to answer to such nonsense as this?",
  "11109": "Their names?",
  "11110": "Then you disapprove of duelling?",
  "11111": "Did I give you this?",
  "11112": "You don't believe in the pulpy gelatinous matter?",

  "11199": "Well now, what is all this to the purpose, as things have turned about?",
  "11200": "Is that seemly?",
  "11201": "Would not one of the gentlemen be good enough to play or sing it?",
  "11202": "Do you think it would be worth while to open up somewhere else in the neighbourhood?",
  "11203": "But could not fasten?",
  "11204": "What are your sentiments?",
  "11205": "You impudent rascal, dare you say so to my face?",
  "11206": "Whither are you going?",
  "11207": "Who indeed?",
  "11208": "Isn't forced, isn't he punished by all this?",
  "11209": "How was it I had never observed her before?",
  "11210": "However, ought I to have been astonished at the answer?",
  "11211": "Why don't you break your backbones, my boys?",
  "11212": "Besides, didn't I say I wouldn't have children?",
  "11213": "Careless, and touched in the temper?",
  "11214": "Well, boy, any signs of such a foundation?",
  "11215": "Can you see anything there?",
  "11216": "Do you know, I could not stand living in this house for even a month?",

  "11230": "Where is she staying now?",
  "11231": "How is it I am not moving?",
  "11232": "It has indeed been a feast of reason and flow of soul, hasn't it?",
  "11233": "Are you jesting with me?",
  "11234": "No notice?",
  "11235": "Then you are not going to demand any money of me?",
  "11236": "Have I no power for good, with you, at all?",
  "11237": "Are you ready, friends?",
  "11238": "Then, again, if not poison, what had caused the man's death, since there was neither wound nor marks of strangulation?",
  "11239": "Not my flight?",
  "11240": "What door?",
  "11241": "Can I have seen him abroad?",
  "11242": "Emmy, why didn't you have a bouquet?",
  "11243": "How deep is it?",
  "11244": "Why should this servant be so anxious to master this old formula?",
  "11245": "Whence the following wisdom?",
  "11246": "What was she thinking of doing?",
  "11247": "Besides, who knew that some foreign marksman might not pot the censor?",
  "11248": "Is it thus you reply to me?",
  "11249": "Will you take me to her?",
  "11250": "So novel?",
  "11251": "What you say here about virtue and justice and institutions and laws being the best things among men?",
  "11252": "They took this way?",
  "11253": "What does one want with dusty economic, books, which have made the world no better, or with mother's hideous chiffoniers?",
  "11254": "Then do they not love each other now?",
  "11255": "Shall I open it?",
  "11256": "Which dress am I to get ready?",
  "11257": "It would be an impertinence elsewhere, but it is not so here, to ask your name and condition?",
  "11258": "Does she go far?",
  "11259": "Besides, are we ever obliged?",
  "11260": "Why are you always puttering?",
  "11261": "Maisie, can't you see reason?",
  "11262": "What is the character of the addresses?",
  "11263": "That, then, is your opinion?",
  "11264": "Will you sell me a fish?",
  "11265": "Not dare to spit on it?",
  "11266": "Are you going to be my servant?",
  "11267": "What other name does she go by?",
  "11268": "What is its duty?",
  "11269": "But, peradventure, it may be sagaciously urged, how is this?",
  "11270": "And yet how many might I not have been guilty of?",
  "11271": "Do not I tell you she will be your sister?",
  "11272": "So he was not there?",
  "11273": "What are you thinking of, eh?",
  "11274": "However, did I find you out?",
  "11275": "Whither now would they goad him?",
  "11276": "But is the thing settled between you or not?",
  "11277": "So it does not please you to work?",
  "11278": "Your savings?",
  "11279": "If you do not return, how does it concern you?",
  "11280": "How much is a plate of peas?",
  "11281": "Would you like to come for a walk?",
  "11282": "Before?",
  "11283": "You won't take it from me?",
  "11284": "Would you not try to save her from suffering more even ifor would you?",
  "11285": "Why spoil such pleasant relations?",
  "11286": "Straker was brought back here, I presume?",
  "11287": "The only ones?",

  "12030": "Why have you brought all that smelly leather stuff into the house?",
  "12031": "Enough, do you think, to loosen that honest tongue of yours?",
  "12032": "I says to myself, shall I go to that doctor, private, and blow on these frauds?",
  "12033": "What order can I take that will content ye?",
  "12034": "How did you get such broad broad feet?",
  "12035": "And who's this?",

  "13025": "Or was it that you had completed your term of life?",
  "13026": "PIGS' TEETH?",
  "13027": "And what is the result of your investigations?",
  "13028": "Not a word of reproach?",
  "13029": "And, if not, whence arises this culpability peculiar to man?",
  "13030": "But how?",
  "13031": "Was this difficult?",
  "13032": "Then I can still count on your support?",
  "13033": "Does it mean that it's the real thing?",

  "13040": "They still come?",
  "13041": "And you don't like strangers?",
  "13042": "Whoever comes here has to walk single file between those two rocks, in fair range of your pistols, boys, d'ye see?",
  "13043": "How do I know whether or no I'm a gentleman myself?",
  "13044": "What art is that?",
  "13045": "And will he then change himself for the better and fairer, or for the worse and more unsightly?",
  "13046": "And what is the whole history?",
  "13047": "The noose, sir?",
  "13048": "Said I, and how, my lad?",

  "13065": "Why did we meet at that fatal woman's house?",
  "13066": "How do you do, my dear boy?",
  "13067": "I'll go up onto the knoll if I may?",
  "13068": "And why doesn't he die, I should like to know?",
  "13069": "And did they repeat what you said?",
  "13070": "Why do you conceal your necessities from me?",
  "13071": "And how do YOU know that he left two million and a half of roubles?",
  "13072": "Do you know if the marriage settlement he promised me has come?",
  "13073": "Now, I ask, why was all this done, but from that extremely weak and expensive doctrine, that the country could not bear it?",
  "13074": "Don't I?",
  "13075": "Sturgis?",
  "13076": "And where mought you have come from?",

  "13082": "How could he have made such a mistake?",
  "13083": "Upon what grounds may I ask?",
  "13084": "Lydgate?",
  "13085": "That's the little window that he got in at, eh?",
  "13086": "Angel and devil by turns, eh?",
  "13087": "It was certain that the settlers would end by reinstating themselves in their domicile and driving out the intruders, but when and how?",
  "13088": "Took away?",
  "13089": "Does that mean you won't pay for it after having told me I could get it?",
  "13090": "Shall I bring him to you?",
  "13091": "Why did you leave the steak to fry, and the ale to run, and then spoil all the meal?",
  "13092": "But do I bid you become phantoms or plants?",
  "13093": "And what will she do now?",
  "13094": "Worse news of what, of whom?",
  "13095": "How could it have been possible?",
  "13096": "Is it an illusion?",
  "13097": "With whom have I the honour?",
  "13098": "Do you know that profound thinker?",
  "13099": "To whom does this island belong?",
  "13100": "Isn't that rather a large order?",
  "13101": "The bourgeoisie?",
  "13102": "And what?",
  "13103": "What do I stay here then?",
  "13104": "Is there to be no limit, no end to the injustice we heap upon this unfortunate people?",

  "13129": "It's very wrong of me, isn't it?",
  "13130": "What does he wish?",
  "13131": "What did the guy mean, do you think?",
  "13132": "Now, what have you to say to that?",
  "13133": "But why do it at all?",
  "13134": "When was it?",
  "13135": "And how much wood is required to make this ship?",
  "13136": "How was this jealousy manifested?",
  "13137": "And how can we justify to ourselves any belief we repose in them?",
  "13138": "How so, general?",
  "13139": "Your majesty is in a hurry, then?",
  "13140": "Was he not now free from all the anxieties and worries of politics?",
  "13141": "Is he not dead?",

  "13154": "Could he allude to an object on whom I dared not even think?",
  "13155": "Do you think that I should undertake this holy office?",
  "13156": "And suppose I disregard your opinion as you disregard mine?",
  "13157": "Or was there, as it rather seemed, a circle of ominous shadow moving along with his deformity whichever way he turned himself?",
  "13158": "What will you say?",
  "13159": "Why is it you have never married?",
  "13160": "But will it not be lost?",
  "13161": "For what?",
  "13162": "Ah, if only I were a man?",
  "13163": "What was it, after all, that a woman wanted?",

  "13165": "Was he shooting?",
  "13166": "What did you say, my dear?",
  "13167": "And you have that letter of the cardinal?",
  "13168": "Can he have an opinion which is an opinion about nothing?",
  "13169": "Who can say whether D'Artagnan may not have betrayed us to the cardinal?",
  "13170": "What's the good of listening further to his lies?",
  "13171": "Whence did I come?",
  "13172": "Solemnity?",

  "14463": "Well, what are they?",
  "14464": "What can I do for you, sir?",
  "14465": "Then what compels me to wait two days?",
  "14466": "Can you form a judgment as to what distance we are likely to be carried?",
  "14467": "Would you like to see?",
  "14468": "You mean, no doubt, that you do not deny that might is right?",
  "14469": "What's the matter with me, anyhow?",
  "14470": "Do you want to have us killed one by one to diminish our force, and put us at the mercy of these wretches?",
  "14471": "Wasn't I honest with you?",
  "14472": "For where was life to be found?",
  "14473": "Will you be so good as to tell your mistress I am here?",
  "14474": "Or at the casement seen her stand?",
  "14475": "Do you mean to see me again?",
  "14476": "It seems a good deal, don't it?",
  "14477": "D'you mean to say you've had nothing but a bottle of milk for the last three days?",
  "14478": "Not if she gave up marrying?",
  "14479": "What makes you think so?",
  "14480": "Then where to seek a proper protector for you against the confusion and chances of such a scene?",
  "14481": "Would it be unreasonable if those who have endured and achieved so much had now come home to rest?",
  "14482": "Why, sir, didn't you order me to marry her, and ain't I a good boy?",
  "14483": "Was it possible that the child was dead and was made alive again?",
  "14484": "How squares that story with thy present plea?",
  "14485": "Haven't you any forged letters to produce?",
  "14486": "Do you know a fish called the pompano?",
  "14487": "Can I believe him?",
  "14488": "Whenever I hit upon a good epithet, I back my luck, don't you see?",
  "14489": "What shame, inglorious if I quit the plain?",
  "14490": "Did that letter thoroughly explain my position and my views?",
  "14491": "With your own eyes?",
  "14492": "What have you got in it?",
  "14493": "Is it not important to know the exact position of affairs?",
  "14494": "How long was he?",
  "14495": "Shall it be a hard or a soft nib?",
  "14496": "Will you believe me?",
  "14497": "And how does he think it may be guarded against?",
  "14498": "What do you think is on his mind?",
  "14499": "What sort of a man was this I had to do with, and what schemes was he now revolving in his fearless mind?",
  "14500": "For what, sir?",
  "14501": "Yet from whom has not that rude hand rent away some dear connection?",
  "14502": "Do you really wish the bairn to go?",
  "14503": "On what charge do you arrest me?",
  "14504": "Why have schools?",
  "14505": "What were you saying?",
  "14506": "When had he a letter before that?",
  "14507": "But could manage them?",
  "14508": "They surely couldn't stop away more than a week, could they now?",
  "14509": "Will you honor your dead?",
  "14510": "Their situation?",
  "14511": "Where are you going to be married?",
  "14512": "Is he doing all right?",
  "14513": "Who had a son, had she not?",
  "14514": "You resist, do you?",
  "14515": "Yes, nobody minds them, so lark away, but don't get wild, will you?",
  "14516": "What then, discreet dame, is it that your mistress wants?",
  "14517": "What does the horrible creature mean?",
  "14518": "But you know where it is?",
  "14519": "If it is useful to go so far, may it not be much more useful to go still farther?",
  "14520": "And whom did that bold hussy think she could persuade to believe that?",
  "14521": "It is not possible, is it, to see a more perfect representation of annihilation?",
  "14522": "What did you do, then?",
  "14523": "What is it all?",
  "14524": "You are fond of gardening?",
  "14525": "But what does that matter?",
  "14526": "Where are they hiding?",
  "14527": "You would not be inclined to say, would you, that navigation is the art of medicine, at least if we are to adopt your exact use of language?",
  "14528": "What would the dear man have?",
  "14529": "Why should we ignore it now?",
  "14530": "Ye flee from me?",
  "14531": "And didn't I hear your message?",
  "14532": "But what if he should suffer the radish through obeying you, and be depillated with hot ashes?",
  "14533": "But where is the compass?",
  "14534": "And if the influence went with him into the tent, whose was it?",
  "14535": "Aren't we going too much to the left?",
  "14536": "Have you got a bit of good net, now?",
  "14537": "That's it, hey?",
  "14538": "Falsehoods?",
  "14539": "But tell me, how do the peasants look at it?",
  "14540": "Have you caught good poems?",
  "14541": "What have you just been saying, my friend?",
  "14542": "Can you tell us where he is?",
  "14543": "What is there to keep them together?",
  "14544": "A what?",
  "14545": "Do you suppose I don't see how you are suffering, how this has torn open your wounds?",
  "14546": "Is it just that she shall leave and pay no part of this herself?",
  "14547": "Do you mean I've been your victim?",
  "14548": "Wrong?",
  "14549": "What's that sir?",
  "14550": "Or while I continue to work at my picture, which will certainly never get finished?",
  "14551": "She has some recent association with the number twelve?",
  "14552": "This wound?",
  "14553": "But not all of it?",
  "14554": "How on earth can I dress up like that?",
  "14555": "So, you did see him when he was talking to you at the table?",
  "14556": "Was ever such a sneaking varmint?",
  "14557": "Is he gentle, father?",
  "14558": "What am I to tell you?",
  "14559": "You do not eat?",
  "14560": "Isn't the whole course of life made up of such?",
  "14561": "He was allying himself to science, for it was science but the absence of prejudice backed by the presence of money?",
  "14562": "Does he think me a ghost?",
  "14563": "Did she know of any place in the neighbourhood where a servant was wanted?",
  "14564": "And very good ones too, I believe, haven't they?",
  "14565": "Passed?",
  "14566": "You surely do not fancy that you can set them free?",
  "14567": "Who can tell it?",
  "14568": "Why will you persist in hopeless obstinacy?",
  "14569": "What did she do at my house?",
  "14570": "And what were the two lines?",
  "14571": "What should we do with this projected surplus?",
  "14572": "And yours?",
  "14573": "Walker, what is it?",
  "14574": "What are you going to do with that?",
  "14575": "What should we have to do?",
  "14576": "Have you no more to add?",
  "14577": "Then have you perceived that you say nothing to the purpose?",
  "14578": "Ye tremble at this word?",
  "14579": "Why has she done nothing to set things right?",
  "14580": "Who informed you this was the master I propose to you?",
  "14581": "Have you mentioned this death in your paper?",
  "14582": "How else could we live did the outer world not furnish our labour and our food?",
  "14583": "What were they to do?",
  "14584": "Work?",
  "14585": "And suppose we don't get her out of the house?",
  "14586": "How can I help it, if power like to walk on crooked legs?",
  "14587": "Wasn't I right to part with the horses?",
  "14588": "But if in my adventure I encounter aright, as I hope I will, shall I be fortunate?",
  "14589": "Where would I go to?",
  "14590": "Kit's there, is he?",
  "14591": "In what particulars?",
  "14592": "And your master, where is he?",
  "14593": "What have I to do with politics?",
  "14594": "And how far is it from looking to being, my good geographer?",
  "14595": "Is it unusual, unsophisticated, primitive?",
  "14596": "Isn't that a romantic name?",
  "14597": "Might we ask why there has been all this secrecy?",
  "14598": "What, is he gone unto my mother?",
  "14599": "Thy means of feeding?",
  "14600": "Oh, that was what you were saying as I came in?",
  "14601": "When did I first begin?",
  "14602": "Woan't yaw, my lad?",
  "14603": "Why, how so?",
  "14604": "Her heart simple and wilful as a bird's heart?",
  "14605": "What might the gentleman's name be, sir, that sent it?",
  "14606": "And is it worth tormenting oneself, when one has only a moment of life in comparison with eternity?",
  "14607": "May not something be done for her instant relief?",
  "14608": "Why do you spoil him like this?",
  "14609": "Then what has happened?",
  "14610": "Who knows?",
  "14611": "How dare you?",
  "14612": "But you care for such things?",
  "14613": "Who could give you stouter help in return for your own support?",
  "14614": "What acquirement exalts one being above another?",
  "14615": "Who would care to live in such a region?",
  "14616": "And her address?",
  "14617": "How, then, could he have heard the bell?",
  "14618": "Were they plotting against me?",
  "14619": "And to the odd is opposed the even?",
  "14620": "But what are you going to do with the hay?",
  "14621": "He has not been moved at all?",
  "14622": "Why isn't there any one to look after you?",
  "14623": "In heredity?",
  "14624": "And what is a man that he should not run with his brothers?",
  "14625": "And you really mean to stay by till that day comes?",
  "14626": "And when did mother die?",
  "14627": "And why glorious, my young friend?",
  "14628": "Are you going to get such and such a hat?",
  "14629": "Why train technicians?",
  "14630": "Why should we linger here?",
  "14631": "Do you think he is the devil, that so many of us should be afraid of him?",
  "14632": "What did she know?",
  "14633": "His father had just been trampled under foot and stamped upon in his presence, but by whom?",
  "14634": "And what is he to do?",
  "14635": "How do you think his majesty is affected?",
  "14636": "What experience have you had?",
  "14637": "Have you a sponge in your room?",
  "14638": "How can I look my husband in the face after this?",
  "14639": "You are looking for my daughter?",
  "14640": "Well, how is he now?",
  "14641": "Do you not see how he is trembling now?",
  "14642": "Why is the chestnut on the right?",
  "14643": "What judgment is he entitled to pass upon contemporary reformers?",
  "14644": "My father's?",
  "14645": "Do you oftentimes find your mind contemplating the wonders of creation and the glories of salvation?",
  "14646": "Am I a nasty, cruel, selfish, bad mama?",
  "14647": "Are they very theatrical people here?",
  "14648": "How could they continue to cherish expectations that were invariably doomed to disappointment?",
  "14649": "Do you take an interest in this affair?",
  "14650": "Did I?",
  "14651": "Have mankind treated me as a brother?",
  "14652": "How old is the others?",
  "14653": "Why should I trouble myself?",
  "14654": "Well, but you saw him, didn't you?",
  "14655": "Those chickens?",
  "14656": "Shan't you be glad to come and see us?",
  "14657": "Does any one do wrong?",
  "14658": "But are you not measured, then, when you give an order?",
  "14659": "To what court of appeal can we refer the conflicts which may arise when ultimate authorities disagree?",
  "14660": "I asked them why they did not themselves remain in their old homes?",
  "14661": "Did you tell him?",
  "14662": "Is it an island?",
  "14663": "Who says this?",
  "14664": "So placed that YOU have to arrange?",
  "14665": "If, then, for a common object this property is to be sacrificed, is it not just that it be done at a common charge?",
  "14666": "Is the quarrel of MY making?",
  "14667": "Any bad habits?",
  "14668": "What I wanted to tell you?",
  "14669": "Are you sure you have a good driver?",
  "14670": "Will you believe?",
  "14671": "What has he done to you?",
  "14672": "You haven't worked against me?",
  "14673": "And the body is more like the changing?",
  "14674": "Is this it?",
  "14675": "Well, it's a pity to cut the pie if you're not hungry, isn't it?",
  "14676": "But how did she go through it?",
  "14677": "What is it that you fear?",
  "14678": "Whither will you lead me?",
  "14679": "But how many generations of the women who had gone to her making had descended bandaged to the family vault?",
  "14680": "What am I to say to her?",
  "14681": "Have you been sick?",
  "14682": "Is he untidy?",
  "14683": "So we meet again, my travelling friend, do we?",
  "14684": "You don't admit that a woman is a social being?",
  "14685": "You won't be angry, will you?",
  "14686": "What dim forms are those on the ladder?",
  "14687": "And he doesn't lie?",
  "14688": "And what did I thrust my address upon her for?",
  "14689": "And when are you coming to me?",
  "14690": "Is my flesh brass?",
  "14691": "So he wrote that you were to bring me a copy of his confession, did he?",
  "14692": "But why, in the greater society or confederacy of mankind, should not the case be the same as in particular clubs and companies?",
  "14693": "How can it be supposed that he should be the only rich man in his dominions who is insensible to pleasures of this kind ?",
  "14694": "Hain't we got all the fools in town on our side?",
  "14695": "Can any picture be more dreadful than that?",
  "14696": "Did I keep it?",
  "14697": "My dear, do you know that you are forgetting yourself altogether?",
  "14698": "They're in column, aren't they?",
  "14699": "Where is divine action here?",
  "14700": "Could his own conscience ever forgive him if he deserted her?",
  "14701": "Why SHOULD I go there?",
  "14702": "It bores you to be like other men?",
  "14703": "And when do you expect this to happen?",
  "14704": "Had he lost his power of scenting out catastrophes?",
  "14705": "The mountains?",
  "14706": "Might she not have feared that her appearance would, after a while, have failed to content you?",
  "14707": "What names are masculine?",
  "14708": "How like you this first exploit of his?",
  "14709": "Why didn't you show it to me?",
  "14710": "How came the wheel off?",
  "14711": "How now, what says the notary?",
  "14712": "What are your questions?",
  "14713": "Do you think it mercy to save the bird?",
  "14714": "What would there be left for us if we had not that?",

  "14716": "One?",
  "14717": "And this gentleman, being disengaged, takes to the service willingly?",
  "14718": "Why was I not born in those happy times?",
  "14719": "Madam, don't you perceive it?",
  "14720": "Do you think I'll sit at home here and take your 'too busys' and 'can't come,' while you parade around and make out that I'm unable to come?",
  "14721": "Who could hurt him more than he had been hurt already?",
  "14722": "Does she love the bad?",
  "14723": "How is he succeeding?",
  "14724": "Don't you see, papa, that I get weaker, every day?",
  "14725": "You have seen our managers WALK BACKWARD?",
  "14726": "What's wrong?",
  "14727": "Cos'e?",
  "14728": "Can you tell me where?",
  "14729": "Haven't you had enough exercise for one day?",
  "14730": "Victor, when falsehood can look so like the truth, who can assure themselves of certain happiness?",
  "14731": "And the composition?",
  "14732": "Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless?",
  "14733": "Is that which can bend and turn, and descend and ascend, to fit every crooked phase of selfish, worldly society, religion?",
  "14734": "You will at least accept my gratitude?",
  "14735": "What's the reward for putting it back in the bundle as it was before?",
  "14736": "Ye can, can ye?",
  "14737": "What was their beauty to me in a few weeks?",
  "14738": "What is it they're so pleased with?",
  "14739": "But what is pure?",
  "14740": "You have a clue?",
  "14741": "Where were we going, and what were we to do?",
  "14742": "Might his life, if not saved, be prolonged for some days?",
  "14743": "What are you talking about?",
  "14744": "And yet what law divine have I transgressed?",
  "14745": "Do you forgive your enemies, and depart hence at peace with yourself and with mankind?",
  "14746": "What government, district, and parish?",
  "14747": "We knew that an enormous amount of weight could be saved, but how much?",
  "14748": "Was this, then, the end of his six years of unflagging devotion?",
  "14749": "Well, sir?",
  "14750": "What do these things mean?",
  "14751": "Did she call?",
  "14752": "Nothing WHATEVER?",
  "14753": "Is it like?",
  "14754": "Can I have unintentionally wounded my best comrade?",
  "14755": "Whence did I get it?",
  "14756": "What could we do with any theory which should leave them out of consideration?",
  "14757": "Do you say no?",
  "14758": "What had become of the agent himself?",
  "14759": "What was he like then, as a wrestler?",
  "14760": "Can you not carry your meat and your liquor decently?",
  "14761": "Your aunt, sir?",
  "14762": "Won't it do you good?",
  "14763": "Are you a materialist?",
  "14764": "Are his hands loose?",
  "14765": "How old were you when you came upon him in the little churchyard?",
  "14766": "Why ain't you at work?",
  "14767": "Should not the actual possessor be preferred to the evicted possessor?",
  "14768": "What was that sound?",
  "14769": "Won't you now?",
  "14770": "Wasn't it so?",
  "14771": "Why has she been removed?",
  "14772": "Does he see a ghost, or hear an organ?",
  "14773": "Why, who's got it?",
  "14774": "But what has it to do with me?",
  "14775": "Have they advanced his fortune, enlarged his knowledge, or reformed his conduct, to the degree that was once expected?",
  "14776": "But have you told me all?",
  "14777": "What are you talking of?",
  "14778": "How do you know it?",
  "14779": "Didn't you see those four runaways cry at the sight of her?",
  "14780": "How's the patient?",
  "14781": "Is it possible for the human mind to conceive of a more horrible state of society?",
  "14782": "Still, what can we do?",
  "14783": "Have the police come?",
  "14784": "What are we waiting for?",
  "14785": "Is it all over?",
  "14786": "ARE you going to marry her or not?",
  "14787": "And can force, in default of reason, alone introduce them into our laws?",
  "14788": "Do you think he will die?",
  "14789": "Why should I not take his part?",
  "14790": "Make up for what?",
  "14791": "The procureur?",
  "14792": "Ah, yes, where is my sister?",
  "14793": "And you mean to say the little thing is very fascinating, I suppose?",
  "14794": "All of whom will call one another citizens?",
  "14795": "And was that how it all ended?",
  "14796": "Perhaps you had better let me pay up, or they'll think we've run away?",
  "14797": "Where is the necessity of this hallucination?",
  "14798": "Ain't it yours too, father?",
  "14799": "Why should YOU take it on yourself?",
  "14800": "Am I like her?",
  "14801": "Is he to be compelled to do so?",
  "14802": "Again?",
  "14803": "You don't mean the infant phenomenon?",
  "14804": "But who ever reflects that, for certain boys, an unjust imposition may be as great a pang as the death of a friend in later years?",
  "14805": "Spirit, are they yours?",
  "14806": "What difference is it to you?",
  "14807": "Would you have voted what you felt and knew to be a lie?",

  "14812": "Do you say so, miss?",
  "14813": "But, in the first place, how did he manage to enter the convent?",
  "14814": "Are they hoping with our help to triumph over their foes or to be useful to their friends?",
  "14815": "Who fears the fallen dew?",
  "14816": "What counterbalance?",
  "14817": "Why, you did nothing wrong?",
  "14818": "If you know, why don't you tell?",
  "14819": "Aren't you but fifteen?",
  "14820": "Will you permit me, then, to recall another to you?",
  "14821": "Where is your native isle?",
  "14822": "Why aren't you asleep, sir?",
  "14823": "You will not sell it, will you?",
  "14824": "My dearest girl, what is the matter?",
  "14825": "In what respect?",
  "14826": "Maylie?",
  "14827": "Why were the holy relics, the arms, ammunition, gunpowder, and stores of corn not removed?",
  "14828": "How long has he been away?",

  "14840": "O, then, you are in love with him?",
  "14841": "What sort of a face was I to draw?",
  "14842": "Can you believe so?",
  "14843": "Who made this man my master?",
  "14844": "Why should he have pardoned me, then?",
  "14845": "That is so, is it not?",
  "14846": "How has he got rich?",
  "14847": "What more of the man she had told them of before?",
  "14848": "What can all this mean?",
  "14849": "Of what use would it be?",
  "14850": "It's natural and right for 'em to talk different from each other, ain't it?",

  "15023": "Why, what is the matter?",
  "15024": "And what did you say?",
  "15025": "Who is right and who is wrong?",
  "15026": "But if a man had a danger hanging over him, and knew what it was, don't you think he would turn to the police for protection?",
  "15027": "How did it show itself?",

  "15033": "What may YOUR game be, ma'am?",
  "15034": "But what does it show?",
  "15035": "Or hear, except with the ear?",
  "15036": "Was it for this I condescended to take you to my bed, you poor, withered, sapless twig?",
  "15037": "What is the wind?",
  "15038": "It wasn't your fault so why should you mind?",
  "15039": "What must I answer?",
  "15040": "Is there any talk yet of who is to run?",
  "15041": "Must it be so?",
  "15042": "But what can we do?",
  "15043": "Why did you push yourself in there by daylight?",
  "15044": "And does not marriage mean motherhood?",
  "15045": "Don't you belong to the barricade?",
  "15046": "And what do you suppose the master will think when I display it before him?",
  "15047": "Hand over, will you?",
  "15048": "And think there was to you no conscience of the housebreaker, what would you do?",
  "15049": "What is it that you will not do?",

  "15052": "By asking advice instead of exerting the judgment?",
  "15053": "Another one, eh?",
  "15054": "Who are they that carry it?",
  "15055": "For what can be the meaning of a truly wise man wanting to fly away and lightly leave a master who is better than himself?",
  "15056": "You think, probably, that I roam around, and get into all sorts of evil?",
  "15057": "Why weren't you at the races yesterday?",
  "15058": "But fly whither?",
  "15059": "May it be that I see you?",

  "15066": "Yes, isn't it, dear?",
  "15067": "What more need be said?",
  "15068": "Will no danger threaten him?",
  "15069": "How can you reconcile it to your conscience, I wonder, to prejudice my own boy against me, or against anybody who is dear to me?",
  "15070": "Nor of any other such person?",
  "15071": "Will your excellency deign to open it?",
  "15072": "Who amongst us is there that does not recollect similar hours of bitter, bitter childish grief?",
  "15073": "How could she be enamoured at once of nobleness and baseness, or at once desire and not desire one deed and the same?",
  "15074": "What had he really gained by all this trouble?",
  "15075": "And what was his reply?",
  "15076": "Shall I row you ashore?",
  "15077": "Have I been talking in my sleep?",
  "15078": "Where now?",
  "15079": "Who has not, a hundred times, found himself committing a vile or a silly action, for no other reason than because he knows he should not?",
  "15080": "The beginning or the end?",
  "15081": "Indeed, where could we stop?",
  "15082": "Wasn't it a lovely place?",
  "15083": "He is dead, is he not?",
  "15084": "The name of my clerk?",
  "15085": "Will you call for the money, or shall I send it?",
  "15086": "But how to get rid of him?",
  "15087": "Who's going?",
  "15088": "How is the queen?",
  "15089": "So you refuse my request?",
  "15090": "You wonder what?",
  "15091": "And who is that other person?",
  "15092": "Rheumatism, sir?",
  "15093": "Am I my brother's keeper?",
  "15094": "What do you mean by early?",
  "15095": "Would they be likely to get rid of seven men out of eight from their own gang and retain only the eighth man?",
  "15096": "You will go to the city and make money, eh?",
  "15097": "Do you think he had planned this robbery, when he went with you to the lodging?",
  "15098": "O, is your bundle ready?",
  "15099": "Real friends?",
  "15100": "Will you never get on to your job?",
  "15101": "And about what?",
  "15102": "You owe her her wages, I suppose?",
  "15103": "Do you know what you have said?",
  "15104": "Balderstone?",
  "15105": "I am having a room got ready for you here, and will you please come round at once on getting this?",
  "15106": "But we owe something in this house?",
  "15107": "And what about afterwards?",
  "15108": "But where will we be tomorrow?",
  "15109": "What advice?",
  "15110": "Who told her?",
  "15111": "Remarkable for what?",
  "15112": "Is it not what happens to every one?",
  "15113": "But how is it she does not think of it herself?",
  "15114": "Who may it be for?",
  "15115": "I say, laddie, you don't object if I sing slightly from time to time during the journey?",
  "15116": "What makes you weep, mama?",
  "15117": "Where is his office?",
  "15118": "What do you mean by that question?",
  "15119": "If this is the great evil of being alone, then what is good and what is evil?",
  "15120": "Have you any arms?",
  "15121": "Are they in possession of our letters?",
  "15122": "Do you observe this gallery, or rather lobby, indeed?",
  "15123": "When will you do that?",
  "15124": "And will not the words and the character of the style depend on the temper of the soul?",
  "15125": "Do you not think that it would be regrettable if we had met in vain?",
  "15126": "Why did she come?",
  "15127": "Is it not safe e'en to encounter him?",
  "15128": "Did any haberdasher ever look so smirking?",
  "15129": "But what degree of intensity will overbalance what period of duration?",
  "15130": "Couldn't we enlarge it, hollow it out, make openings to let in light and air?",
  "15131": "How can I desire children?",
  "15132": "Would I only come and look at the range?",
  "15133": "What is the prisoner's name?",
  "15134": "Well, hasn't it made it exactly what we wanted?",
  "15135": "How can there be any secrecy, when everything is known to all of us?",
  "15136": "You won't carry me off in your bags, will ye, master?",
  "15137": "Where is your master's diocese?",
  "15138": "Why did he so?",
  "15139": "What was it, my own mother?",
  "15140": "But when you held her in your power, why did you not drown her, strangle her, hang her?",
  "15141": "But by whom will Z be paid for the loss caused him by the profit charged by A in the beginning?",
  "15142": "Perhaps, sir, you don't like the ship?",
  "15143": "Do you think I'd let him imagine for a minute that anything he said could influence me in my public duty?",
  "15144": "Is she safe?",
  "15145": "Have I offended you?",
  "15146": "Then you are on guard every day?",
  "15147": "But this castle, then?",
  "15148": "You know him, then?",
  "15149": "What, said he, I wonder, will the good old couple say to it?",
  "15150": "My hand?",
  "15151": "You consider it, then, perfectly unworthy of a woman to love a man who does not adore her?",
  "15152": "Why are you upset?",
  "15153": "Have you anything to ask of me?",
  "15154": "I've accepted your dismissal, and you managed it as cruelly as you could, and I have made you respect my sex, haven't I?",
  "15155": "What must I do?",
  "15156": "You have formed some conclusion?",
  "15157": "Was not the observation of the chief only what might have been expected?",
  "15158": "What right have I to betray the confidence reposed in me, when nothing but a miracle can prevent this sacrifice?",
  "15159": "But how many passions have amalgamated to form that hatred?",
  "15160": "Can't you be generous and unselfish enough to face whatever trial there may be for you in this bit of a coincidence?",
  "15161": "How did she come there?",
  "15162": "Now, don't you think the lad would be handsomer cropped?",
  "15163": "Who could have told that such a hurricane had been let loose on the surface of that ocean?",
  "15164": "Are you tired?",
  "15165": "What is the result at present?",
  "15166": "Were you never taught to say your prayers?",
  "15167": "Well, said he, who next?",
  "15168": "Is it suppression?",
  "15169": "Then they will quarrel as those who intend some day to be reconciled?",
  "15170": "Where is the pain?",
  "15171": "Why did you take the axe along?",
  "15172": "How was it done?",
  "15173": "And why are you all alone?",
  "15174": "The scene which followed, who can describe?",
  "15175": "Where would you have been, my dear, if I hadn't meddled with YOU?",
  "15176": "Where does he expect me to get it?",
  "15177": "Did you call, sir?",
  "15178": "Where, then, is your enthusiasm?",
  "15179": "Do you wish it?",
  "15180": "Do you really think so, doctor?",
  "15181": "Oh, is that all?",
  "15182": "Is the point of my mantle in the middle, and have I looped my dress evenly?",
  "15183": "Fifty dollars?",

  "15193": "Could they be assembled in arms, who would dare to assume the office of general?",
  "15194": "Does any one know with whom?",
  "15195": "Now, do you not call that base?",
  "15196": "You think that's a condemnation?",
  "15197": "What have you found?",
  "15198": "And just on this line between the setting and rising sun?",
  "15199": "What was the matter with her, what could be going on, to affect any one like that?",

  "15236": "Set off?",
  "15237": "Would you like some tea?",
  "15238": "And can any one of those many things which are called by particular names be said to be this rather than not to be this?",
  "15239": "So you like it, you rogue?",
  "15240": "How was her face?",
  "15241": "When does she come down?",
  "15242": "An unaccustom'd guest?",

  "18442": "Which way is not despair?",
  "18443": "And what brings you up here under somebody else's name?",
  "18444": "May it not be that the utopists find it easier to expatiate upon these grand words than to seriously study social manifestations?",

  "18482": "Shall I repent of it?",
  "18483": "And do well, I am sure?",
  "18484": "Who brought me here?",
  "18485": "But fortitude presupposes strength of mind, and is strength of mind to be acquired by indolent acquiescence?",
  "18486": "To what extent?",
  "18487": "That's the problem, isn't it?",
  "18488": "But whom send I to judge them?",
  "18489": "Now I am sure that you would not be too proud to earn the price of a new dress, would you?",

  "18505": "Can't ye never keep things sep'rate?",
  "18506": "Did you never hear that?",
  "18507": "You mean when money is not wanted, but allowed to lie?",
  "18508": "Perhaps you cannot talk now?",
  "18509": "What do you intend?",
  "18510": "Or do you decline and dissent from this?",

  "18540": "What sort of night was it?",
  "18541": "Your younger sisters must be very young?",
  "18542": "So soon as that?",
  "18543": "My dear, how am I to say?",
  "18544": "Why, what would you do with them?",
  "18545": "And after all, what did it matter to me, and why did it matter to me?",
  "18546": "But, if you love me you would like me to be your husband?",
  "18547": "And their names?",
  "18548": "Why did you not ask for me at my room if you were in the hotel?",

  "22794": "Had you not better go and dress?",
  "22795": "What is our sin, after all?",
  "22796": "Is it a good country?",
  "22797": "Possibly you mean that I am one?",
  "22798": "What's the good of thinking about that now?",
  "22799": "Did he speak of sending me to our father?",
  "22800": "And how do you suppose they do this?",
  "22801": "Come, will you, or won't you?",

  "25745": "Was there no one with you?",
  "25746": "Can you tell us what to do?",
  "25747": "To whom?",
  "25748": "When a good man sticks his bayonet through another good man, father of a family, or, perhaps, a great artist, what idea is he following out?",

  "25808": "Is not that it?",
  "25809": "Forgive you?",
  "25810": "What association?",
  "25811": "But where are these persons, then?",

  "25813": "Where shall we lie in wait?",
  "25814": "And by what gate did they go out?",
  "25815": "From whom can come so many disgraces heaped upon her head, if not from him?",
  "25816": "Who invited you?",
  "25817": "Making love in play, eh?",
  "25818": "How, then, could his father's heart remain void, and closed to its influence?",
  "25819": "Have you heard the story?",
  "25820": "Would you really give us the money?",
  "25821": "But what other internal attributes of such an object can I think than those which my internal sense presents to me?",
  "25822": "Any children?",
  "25823": "How is it distant?",
  "25824": "Which box do you mean?",
  "25825": "How can a system of education flourish that begins by so monstrous a falsehood, which the sense of hearing suffices to contradict?",

  "25837": "And does he catch plenty of fish?",
  "25838": "Did you ever stop to think of all the love letters that have been found after death?",
  "25839": "Why do you say that?",
  "25840": "What could she have to conceal from me whose happiness she knew principally consisted in that of herself and her daughter?",
  "25841": "You wouldn't care to go on board for the next trip, and have tea there?",
  "25842": "Do you expect news from him?",
  "25843": "Will you trust me?",
  "25844": "On what authority, then, do you venture to attack universal consent, and give the lie to the human race?",
  "25845": "Say, is it thus those honours you requite?",
  "25846": "Where is he who called me?",
  "25847": "May I not come near you?",

  "25906": "That is to say, as a thinker who regards morality as questionable, as worthy of interrogation, in short, as a problem?",
  "25907": "Of course you are prepared to identify the property?",
  "25908": "Do you consent to the terms, and will you take the money?",
  "25909": "How does it begin?",
  "25910": "I say, what's to prevent our employing this worthy woman, your mother?",
  "25911": "What is more peaceful than the calm, even flowing of a river?",

  "27563": "Well, why have I worried him, for five years, and never let him go free?",
  "27564": "All that seven hundred dollars?",
  "27565": "But meantime, how am I to get on with my washing?",
  "27566": "Are there then chains for two which are forged on high?",
  "27567": "Then why don't you go?",
  "27568": "How could you have gone away and left me?",
  "27569": "Oh, why had not she, like this woman, resisted, implored?",
  "27570": "Yes, child, but why don't we take him into the parlour, now that we've got a nice parlour for company?",
  "27571": "Is any better than experience and wisdom and reason?",
  "27572": "Is it my fault that your father has dishonored himself?",
  "27573": "But can that which is neither become both?",
  "27574": "But he really is disinterested, and above small jealousy and spite, I have heard?",
  "27575": "And he rests now, near his companions, in the coral cemetery?",
  "27576": "What are we to do, now?",
  "27577": "And now, where is he gone?",
  "27578": "Do you not need to mitigate the struggle for existence more sanguine than the war of weapons?",
  "27579": "When will he come back?",
  "27580": "Suppose you haven't?",
  "27581": "Is it me, yer reverence?",
  "27582": "And why should I not dare?",
  "27583": "And is he in love perchance?",
  "27584": "Surely, this was not the only cause of estrangement?",
  "27585": "Where had he heard the name before?",
  "27586": "Where's my mother?",
  "27587": "Ah, isn't my whole point that he's charming to her?",
  "27588": "Were you looking for us?",
  "27589": "But tell me, and tell me true, what is the meaning of all this feasting, and who are these people?",
  "27590": "Has it begun?",
  "27591": "Where are you taking me?",
  "27592": "What's all this?",
  "27593": "Shall you be present in the reception room?",
  "27594": "What was the matter?",
  "27595": "An astrologer predicted that?",
  "27596": "What magazine, or treasury of bliss?",
  "27597": "What do I think?",
  "27598": "Ah, why DID he?",
  "27599": "How could I ask you to gif up so much for a poor old fellow, who has no fortune but a little learning?",
  "27600": "To whom, think ye, is your life of such consequence, that they should seek to bereave ye of it?",
  "27601": "Is it quite certain?",
  "27602": "Isn't that true, doctor?",
  "27603": "Clayton?",
  "27604": "Why do you not think so?",
  "27605": "And you will permit me to accompany you?",
  "27606": "And when he doesn't say pretty things?",
  "27607": "And you can refuse, you mean, eh?",
  "27608": "Sure, amn't I never done at the drunken bowsy ever since he left school?",
  "27609": "What, then, was there left to do?",
  "27610": "What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed?",
  "27611": "Are you so sure?",
  "27612": "Is that too simple a source of pleasure for some to prize?",
  "27613": "Then you knew her before?",
  "27614": "Have you not asked papa for money?",
  "27615": "Is there anything whimsical about me?",
  "27616": "Wouldn't it be nice if it could last?",
  "27617": "Is this ingratitude, however?",
  "27618": "For nothing?",
  "27619": "The winch, you say?",
  "27620": "Was ever a man in such a fearful fool's position?",
  "27621": "But this kind man who has done so much will, I am sure, take you right on to my house?",
  "27622": "But if no one among us is capable of governing himself, then who among us has the capacity to govern someone else?",
  "27623": "Was personal happiness the aim and object of their ambition?",
  "27624": "Have you ever seen a wire jacket?",
  "27625": "Cranmer awaits us in the private chapel?",
  "27626": "And how about today's telegram?",
  "27627": "Where had that daring singer got to?",
  "27628": "Was it he who threw us that bottle, when the vessel made her first cruise?",
  "27629": "You didn't mean to ask that?",
  "27630": "Brilliant?",
  "27631": "Getting a little beyond our depth, dear, aren't we?",
  "27632": "Now, what is competition?",
  "27633": "Why didn't you come near us all these three days, eh?",
  "27634": "Do you know that you are speaking to me quite as a friend?",
  "27635": "What do you do then?",
  "27636": "Do you think we live as cheaply as we might?",
  "27637": "You haven't opened the parcel and swallowed one or two as you come along, have you?",
  "27638": "Surely there are classified lists?",
  "27639": "Who knows whether man is not a recaptured offender against divine justice?",
  "27640": "Why ride into the middle of the battalion?",
  "27641": "May I ask if you can confirm these statements?",
  "27642": "Is not this an infallible and sovereign antidote?",
  "27643": "Well, what's this now?",
  "27644": "Isn't it fortunate I've got such an imagination?",
  "27645": "Now, what have we a right to possess?",
  "27646": "A cigarette?",
  "27647": "But what did he do, my dear?",
  "27648": "What act?",
  "27649": "What in thunder is it?",
  "27650": "And the man?",
  "27651": "How am I to understand you, mon pere?",
  "27652": "Why dilate upon what everybody knows?",
  "27653": "Might this be for you, sir?",
  "27654": "How can you learn lessons in here?",
  "27655": "Who be these?",
  "27656": "Do you love my son?",
  "27657": "Who gets up in the gray dawn to call on another man's wife?",
  "27658": "What follows that angel?",
  "27659": "Will it strengthen our families and support our children?",
  "27660": "Why where should I leave them but where I found them?",
  "27661": "Shall he now be arrested in his desolating career?",
  "27662": "Do you know what that means?",
  "27663": "But why should I make a long story of it?",
  "27664": "Mightn't I stay and sleep with you tonight, grandmother?",
  "27665": "Are you not jealous at all?",
  "27666": "And is not the chief object of vanity, our bravery or learning, our wit or breeding, our eloquence or address, our taste or abilities?",
  "27667": "Jo, I hope you haven't done anything rash?",
  "27668": "And do you believe it to be so?",
  "27669": "Do you take milk in yours?",
  "27670": "What fiend is this?",
  "27671": "Where are they?",
  "27672": "Would any one believe it?",
  "27673": "What if I've accepted too passively the funny form of our life?",
  "27674": "What, indeed, can tend to deprave the character more than outward submission and inward contempt?",
  "27675": "If they bite and kick?",
  "27676": "Is there that about me that should affright a man?",
  "27677": "For how can any experience be adequate with an idea?",
  "27678": "What is this I hear about you?",
  "27679": "How old are you, dear?",
  "27680": "I wonder if they made that fearful sound I heard just before you came?",
  "27681": "What made them kick you out?",
  "27682": "Am I allowed to repeat it?",
  "27683": "I think that this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with me for six o'clock?",
  "27684": "Have you any dice in your pocket?",
  "27685": "What on earth put such a notion into your head?",
  "27686": "None belonging to your father?",
  "27687": "What had he to say?",
  "27688": "Owing to him?",
  "27689": "To me, sir?",
  "27690": "What do you suppose she wants to talk about tomorrow?",
  "27691": "Would he say a lie?",
  "27692": "How much money had these men fraudulently obtained?",
  "27693": "How many have you loved?",
  "27694": "Then why, when you were able to run away, did you go back to him?",
  "27695": "And don't you think the governor ought to let me have it?",
  "27696": "You are alone?",
  "27697": "What are your favourite flowers?",
  "27698": "Why didn't I go in then?",
  "27699": "By your misfortune?",
  "27700": "Now are you satisfied?",
  "27701": "Who is your lady friend with the big grey envelope and the fat monogram outside?",
  "27702": "Have you got them?",
  "27703": "Did you get lost?",
  "27704": "I wonder how he felt when he heard it?",
  "27705": "What need for weapon?",
  "27706": "'Ow many times have I got to tell you to be careful of them plates?",
  "27707": "Weevle?",
  "27708": "What you're after, why you left the block house, why you given me that there chart, I don't know, now, do I?",
  "27709": "Are we falling?",
  "27710": "And by character?",
  "27711": "And would not a really good education furnish the best safeguard?",
  "27712": "What manner of man are you?",
  "27713": "I think you are growing less cool, my friend, and are beginning to be a trifle surprised, aren't you?",
  "27714": "And that one?",
  "27715": "Has he ever taken from the rich that he did not give again to the poor?",
  "27716": "Has your mother relented at last?",
  "27717": "What do you want to do?",
  "27718": "Is this all your spinning, grandmother?",
  "27719": "What sort of ship?",
  "27720": "And do they not share?",
  "27721": "Why isn't it enough?",
  "27722": "Shall I meet strange, heavenly things?",
  "27723": "Didn't I see him seize your hand?",
  "27724": "What is that thing?",
  "27725": "But who else?",
  "27726": "Why, how?",
  "27727": "Do you hear, my children?",
  "27728": "Can you deny that all that was craft and deceit and fraud and greed?",
  "27729": "You mean that she will be killed merely to thwart me?",
  "27730": "How shall we set about it?",
  "27731": "Not too difficult?",
  "27732": "Were his father's religious devotion, his teachers warnings, his own knowledge, his own search able to keep him safe?",
  "27733": "Should they be embarked?",
  "27734": "Is my experience but of yesterday?",
  "27735": "Can I trust in you?",
  "27736": "Are you in earnest?",
  "27737": "Where are you to go?",
  "27738": "Do you want to earn half a crown?",
  "27739": "Wilcox?",
  "27740": "What do I mean?",
  "27741": "But will no one remain in the house, my lord?",
  "27742": "How, then, with these variations and with revenues so uncertain, can we establish even distribution and uniform wages for laborers?",
  "27743": "Of the hearses?",
  "27744": "But will you not drink with me, sir?",
  "27745": "What avail is it?",
  "27746": "Don't you see them?",
  "27747": "Oh, I must, hey?",
  "27748": "Or are they both in this their own reward?",
  "27749": "Said ye not truly, aforetime, that we should live and meet?",
  "27750": "What do we do?",
  "27751": "How will you live?",
  "27752": "Why don't you fall yourself?",
  "27753": "Will you remember that, if you please?",
  "27754": "Does he read ee very long zermons, my dear?",
  "27755": "What is a passport?",
  "27756": "How long do you remain in town?",
  "27757": "Don't you, old man?",
  "27758": "Where shall I see the head of him which contrived to murder his father, which I will tear to pieces with my own hands?",
  "27759": "Why this absence of mind, and sweet irresolution?",
  "27760": "We better than you?",
  "27761": "Did this mad wife of his carry it off with her?",
  "27762": "Had the man seen through him?",
  "27763": "But will you promise to have me took there, sir, and laid along with him?",
  "27764": "But if I do not marry?",
  "27765": "Why did he interfere with me, and fill your mind with such falsehood?",
  "27766": "But when one has no experience, how can one tell what is sickness and what is health?",
  "27767": "How can you tell who is poor?",
  "27768": "Is it so precious?",
  "27769": "Why am I to be disturbed?",
  "27770": "Will you take my advice?",
  "27771": "Something important?",
  "27772": "Perhaps you think I am mad, eh?",
  "27773": "Shall you have the courage?",
  "27774": "Will you forget him?",
  "27775": "Wait for you?",
  "27776": "Now, what fault can you point out in him?",
  "27777": "CUI BONO?",
  "27778": "Where had the dragon gone in such a short space of time?",
  "27779": "You've got a friend here?",
  "27780": "What has he made you?",
  "27781": "You keep the registers of entries and departures?",
  "27782": "To what tribe do they belong?",
  "27783": "I don't suppose that you have noticed it?",
  "27784": "Couldn't you ask him here dinner or something?",
  "27785": "And then?",
  "27786": "What does your wife want?",
  "27787": "Couldn't you wish to be married to him yourself, if that was the case?",
  "27788": "You notice those bright green spots scattered thickly over it?",
  "27789": "It was his life or mine, but far more than that, it was his life or hers, for how could I leave her in the power of this madman?",
  "27790": "Then there is a truth I don't know?",
  "27791": "How did I get hold of that?",
  "27792": "Whatever is the matter?",
  "27793": "And it is true that you did not set it on fire?",
  "27794": "Has anything unpleasant happened since I saw you?",
  "27795": "Is it believed that axioms in metaphysics, declarations of right, harangues from the tribune, will put a stop to the disbanding of an army?",
  "27796": "What does not a man undergo for the sake of a cure?",
  "27797": "Shan't you?",
  "27798": "You a member here?",
  "27799": "What is your own experience of him?",
  "27800": "But aren't you mistaken in thinking that you wouldn't force him, wouldn't punish him?",
  "27801": "Me, young ladies?",
  "27802": "What are these corruptions?",
  "27803": "Doesn't he?",
  "27804": "Why must he look farther than their platform when he claims himself to stand by his platform?",
  "27805": "Now, surely, if he takes so warmly to people who are not related to him at all, may he not take as warmly to his own kin?",
  "27806": "Not since the humour of gentility was upon you, did you?",
  "27807": "Governor come round?",
  "27808": "That boy's tutor?",
  "27809": "What is a soul?",
  "27810": "And with our wives?",
  "27811": "Who would think of plotting with a poor little weak creature like me?",
  "27812": "What is his exact kin to us, mother?",
  "27813": "Is this a new brand of humour?",
  "27814": "Yes, what were we talking about?",
  "27815": "Do I know them?",
  "27816": "And what business have you here?",
  "27817": "You know who bricks and mortar is, I suppose, sir?",
  "27818": "Oh, what's the use of me saying anything?",
  "27819": "I make the first advances?",
  "27820": "Why strive for the knowledge of things if we become more cowardly thereby?",
  "27821": "Why, how do you come to be here?",
  "27822": "What the devil is he doing here?",
  "27823": "What's he to do with the lassie?",
  "27824": "Why must people kneel down to pray?",
  "27825": "Do you like him?",
  "27826": "First tell the boys, what we have decided?",
  "27827": "What is it to be?",
  "27828": "Tell us, dear, what do the creatures look like?",
  "27829": "Do you see that whale now?",
  "27830": "How is it that there are birds enough ready to replace immediately a lost mate of either sex?",
  "27831": "You admit, I hope, that I have a right to speak about what concerns the dignity of my wife's sister?",
  "27832": "Will somebody hand me anything hard and bruising to pelt at her?",
  "27833": "Is he industrious at his work and respectful to you?",
  "27834": "That's the way the song runs, isn't it?",
  "27835": "Could her face inspire passion at all now?",
  "27836": "Why ought I to know?",
  "27837": "And you are not furious?",
  "27838": "Ellen, are not you tired?",
  "27839": "Will you let me go away?",
  "27840": "John, why don't you say something?",
  "27841": "But what shall I tell the dairyman's wife?",
  "27842": "And you don't know what they do it for?",
  "27843": "Or at some public school, perhaps?",
  "27844": "They do, do they?",
  "27845": "Is not the night mournful, sad, and melancholic?",
  "27846": "I asked them, if they were at liberty to tell me the truth of what they were to do with me?",
  "27847": "Why are you sorry, sir?",
  "27848": "What prison is he in?",
  "27849": "Shall we go on, your excellency, fine champagne?",
  "27850": "Leave our brother to come to us?",
  "27851": "Will you really not have tea?",
  "27852": "Whom do you expect to find here?",
  "27853": "Have you no other to propose?",
  "27854": "What can a writer, who professes scepticism, have in common with radical views?",
  "27855": "See that blue dory behind him?",
  "27856": "But is an education which ignores them all a liberal education?",
  "27857": "What upon?",
  "27858": "But who has told you?",
  "27859": "Where are my priwileges?",
  "27860": "Well, did she say what she was coming for?",
  "27861": "How can I ever thank you?",
  "27862": "You own the name and renounce the alias?",
  "27863": "Is he of noble family, and rich?",
  "27864": "How then are we to begin our strike to destroy him?",
  "27865": "Who is this boy?",
  "27866": "And who hit you at all?",
  "27867": "What are these men's leading principles, and about what kind of things are they busy, and for what kind of reasons do they love and honor?",
  "27868": "Thornfield?",
  "27869": "May I ask if you are very busy just now?",
  "27870": "How can it concern him to learn how the self came to be what it is, or what it will be in the distant future?",
  "27871": "You think it will?",
  "27872": "But why should I weary you with details?",
  "27873": "So you kept him after all?",
  "27874": "And the queen?",
  "27875": "That we see before our noses?",
  "27876": "Can I never tell my story in a plain, straightforward way?",
  "27877": "Can competition in labor be abolished?",
  "27878": "You cannot help us?",
  "27879": "But what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance?",
  "27880": "What was the use of his being somewhere in the neighbourhood if she had no means of knowing where she could find him?",
  "27881": "You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?",
  "27882": "You will protect me from him?",
  "27883": "Had you heard?",
  "27884": "Can you remember that?",
  "27885": "Ever live by cheating at play?",
  "27886": "Why do you permit such a surgeon to have the care of the sick, wounded, and dying soldiers?",
  "27887": "And is that why he hits her?",
  "27888": "Why, what is there to understand?",
  "27889": "Yet you have a large establishment, too, I am told?",
  "27890": "And you think that I am going to send you back to that world which must know me no more?",
  "27891": "What is done to infanticides in this country?",
  "27892": "And did you see anyone?",
  "27893": "Well, then, what makes you talk so wild?",
  "27894": "You have formed one, then?",
  "27895": "Will you please pardon my rudeness?",
  "27896": "My dear father, may I beg you to prepare your mind for what I am going to say?",
  "27897": "With what my father said just now?",
  "27898": "What did you think of that, sir?",
  "27899": "Would you like me to sit down for a minute or two?",
  "27900": "He is going with you, is he not?",
  "27901": "Of what disposition is he?",
  "27902": "What is it, then?",
  "27903": "Where did you really get them?",
  "27904": "Mark must be here, yet why doesn't he answer me?",
  "27905": "What did you expect to gain by that?",
  "27906": "What heart can hold?",
  "27907": "When horses are injured, are they improved or deteriorated?",
  "27908": "Had he left her there to her fate in the lonely jungle?",
  "27909": "How do you do, all of you?",
  "27910": "Do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not talk as fast, and admire what she admires as rapturously as herself?",
  "27911": "Curious?",
  "27912": "Do you intend to sit up for me?",
  "27913": "But would the man acknowledge the relation?",
  "27914": "What are you doing now?",
  "27915": "Do you suppose that if I had made such a revelation to the king, I should have been alive now?",
  "27916": "He had a passion for pictures, and why should he not be able to paint as well as anybody else?",
  "27917": "Are you the gentleman who caused the accident?",
  "27918": "And the pay?",
  "27919": "Husband?",
  "27920": "I know what everyone would say is the right thing to do, but what do you say?",
  "27921": "What difference can it make to you?",
  "27922": "How could he know what comes from a woman's wavering sympathies, what from her inborn coquetry, and what from love itself?",
  "27923": "Was he a proprietor, or only a usufructuary?",
  "27924": "Wasn't that nonsensical?",
  "27925": "You have sold all your clothes?",
  "27926": "Surely you learnt that too?",
  "27927": "WHAT is it?",
  "27928": "But at this moment who knows if we may not be frightfully crushed between the two glassy surfaces?",
  "27929": "We must take care that that affair comes off all right, must we not?",
  "27930": "Why do you shake me like that?",
  "27931": "Now really should a cock be brought into a tragic play?",
  "27932": "Is his thread spun?",
  "27933": "Have not you an intimate friend?",
  "27934": "But how, and wherewith?",
  "27935": "That was a very different account of matters, was it not?",
  "27936": "What laws mean you?",
  "27937": "And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps?",
  "27938": "And on what will you sleep?",
  "27939": "That is what comes of your gospel of love, is it?",
  "27940": "Beautiful?",
  "27941": "Didn't say nothin' 'bout my old man, s'pose?",
  "27942": "Is it really possible that perfectly innocent people are kept here?",
  "27943": "You know the road?",
  "27944": "So if I say they're gone, you'll bear me witness, will you?",
  "27945": "Why should you not mention the sum?",
  "27946": "They're quite neat and decent, aren't they?",
  "27947": "To what a devil, then, said he, serve so many paltry heaps and bundles of papers and copies which you give me?",

  "28742": "Then, perhaps, you cannot tell me what sort of a woman she is?",
  "28743": "Ye are frightened?",
  "28744": "But how in the world did you know that he was in the house at all?",
  "28745": "May I venture to congratulate you?",
  "28746": "A successor?",
  "28747": "Shall not we two lie on the bridal bed this same night?",
  "28748": "Did all enjoy it?",
  "28749": "Don't you use a study?",
  "28750": "Isn't it damp?",
  "28751": "How was it wrought to such perfection?",
  "28752": "Am I likely to be frozen?",
  "28753": "A presentation?",
  "28754": "Does he wish it?",
  "28755": "Why did you?",
  "28756": "The decline of his fortunes, then?",
  "28757": "What was the cause of such degeneration?",
  "28758": "They are coming, then?",
  "28759": "How can you talk about shame, papa?",
  "28760": "Who is to throw a stone?",
  "28761": "How so, my pet?",
  "28762": "Ambulance or train?",
  "28763": "Dare I ask you to explain?",
  "28764": "Only what are we to talk about?",
  "28765": "Will your ladyship honour me with the CONTREDANSE until your coach is ready?",
  "28766": "Again, if there be nothing real in the universe, what is it that causes unreal objects to appear?",
  "28767": "What do you want of me?",
  "28768": "Not the old business?",
  "28769": "Somebody was coming?",
  "28770": "Mad one, what have I said?",
  "28771": "Do you know I am dissatisfied with your younger son?",
  "28772": "In pain, where?",
  "28773": "Doth it long for knowledge as the lion for his food?",
  "28774": "But what other ways?",
  "28775": "So I come and take, and what do I do?",
  "28776": "But why have you no packing bag?",
  "28777": "He does your bidding?",
  "28778": "Had he not better take the big umbrella?",
  "28779": "But of what?",
  "28780": "Shall you be there, sir?",
  "28781": "You didn't know him, did you?",
  "28782": "Mamma, are you asleep?",
  "28783": "Have I not, sir?",
  "28784": "And so many children poor?",
  "28785": "At least, what?",
  "28786": "Are not the roofs and the lintels wet?",
  "28787": "At what time did he go?",
  "28788": "Perfectly plain, isn't it?",
  "28789": "Then how could they tear me pitilessly from all that was dear to me, and lock me up in prison like a wild animal?",
  "28790": "And who's to make him?",
  "28791": "How did the boat strike when she went in?",
  "28792": "How hight she?",
  "28793": "You understand what I mean?",
  "28794": "But is not war an art?",
  "28795": "Postponed?",
  "28796": "She is, is she?",
  "28797": "Who is fit for it?",
  "28798": "Do you not as a rule think women below your notice as companions?",
  "28799": "Will you tell me where the BRITANNIA was wrecked?",
  "28800": "What chance had they against one who, if she had a mind, could put by out of her income twice as much as they, poor women, could spend?",
  "28801": "What mede is aye to live in comfort?",
  "28802": "Who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads?",
  "28803": "Who's over me?",
  "28804": "Why, in the devil's name, have they served me thus?",
  "28805": "You know her husband, of course?",
  "28806": "Is it possible that the meaning of life was not disclosed to him before he died?",
  "28807": "Are you brutes?",
  "28808": "Think it'll ride?",
  "28809": "What'll the other people in the house say to my being here?",
  "28810": "But was it all there was of life?",
  "28811": "What private box?",
  "28812": "A little buttered toast with the tea?",
  "28813": "Nor written?",
  "28814": "Would I not give all that I have of strength at one blow if I could open his eyes to see as I see but for one minute?",
  "28815": "Consequently, a capital blade?",
  "28816": "And break it out?",
  "28817": "He has the horse, then?",
  "28818": "You're not sorry you've come, are you?",
  "28819": "The entrance cannot be easy?",
  "28820": "Why do I not give it?",
  "28821": "And does that hinder you from letting me know the second reason?",
  "28822": "Clarence?",
  "28823": "Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy?",
  "28824": "Why did you play us such a trick, damn you?",
  "28825": "What is his object?",
  "28826": "What would happen next?",
  "28827": "Who might do this but the women?",
  "28828": "Why don't you scream?",
  "28829": "Do you know that?",
  "28830": "Why, my dear friend, do I not see you?",
  "28831": "But, in truth, what is the good of these disguises?",
  "28832": "Will that restore it to sight?",
  "28833": "Where is this person?",
  "28834": "What can a man spend his ha'pence on here in this country hole?",
  "28835": "Catharine, did I do wrong?",
  "28836": "How much are you out of pocket?",
  "28837": "What has become of her?",
  "28838": "Could we advertise, then, asking for information from wharfingers?",
  "28839": "Does this infinite awaken in us the idea of essence, while we can attribute to ourselves only the idea of existence?",
  "28840": "We will say ten o'clock then?",
  "28841": "To its honors, to its flowers, to its golden aspirations?",
  "28842": "But always smelling those leather books, what can be expected?",
  "28843": "Is it not time for a change?",
  "28844": "What did happen to me?",
  "28845": "Do you think now that I shall tell you what motive he had had in starting out?",
  "28846": "You perhaps think I should have expected this refusal?",
  "28847": "And your cargo?",
  "28848": "You do like me a bit, don't you?",
  "28849": "Who was killed in another place?",
  "28850": "What's the game?",
  "28851": "Not related to her, sir?",
  "28852": "But, they say, is that true right, social right, fraternal right?",
  "28853": "Do you know, sir, that that man did all this?",
  "28854": "Did he give you anything else?",
  "28855": "Why should he die, for he felt that he could not live, under such a weight of obloquy?",
  "28856": "It's he then who has told you?",
  "28857": "Is that all?",
  "28858": "Took?",
  "28859": "How much do you know?",
  "28860": "Out of your own pocket?",
  "28861": "Why was it none would give it, then?",
  "28862": "Shall they be banished from the district, or from the whole land?",
  "28863": "Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?",
  "28864": "Did I abuse you?",
  "28865": "And who wants to be acquainted with you?",
  "28866": "What can you do?",
  "28867": "Are you in love with the cows?",
  "28868": "Not to her uncle?",
  "28869": "Why should it not, at a certain depth, attain an impassable limit, instead of rising to such a point as to fuse the most infusible metals?",
  "28870": "But why have you done it at all?",
  "28871": "Haven't you noticed it?",
  "28872": "And what does this groom do?",
  "28873": "Sun in your eyes and his face in the shadow?",
  "28874": "Would she hear of his being slapped and beat by drummers demnebly?",
  "28875": "Who did all that mischief?",
  "28876": "Ain't we gotta live?",
  "28877": "Are we at the pole?",
  "28878": "Do you hear, do you hear what he says?",
  "28879": "Don't you think you could find some work to do?",
  "28880": "Was he again to be disturbed?",
  "28881": "Was she going to act and keep house?",
  "28882": "But why does he have this idea of a horse?",
  "28883": "Was that his work or was it possibly the doing of someone who was bent upon counteracting his schemes?",
  "28884": "Two minutes wrong?",
  "28885": "Do you not guess, monsieur?",
  "28886": "Where's your horse?",
  "28887": "Will you give me something to eat and a bed?",
  "28888": "What would they do to assist them?",
  "28889": "Let us have the land?",
  "28890": "Does he ever pay the rent for you?",
  "28891": "Might I ask you, sir, to pacify my mind?",
  "28892": "It is difficult to rise above the jungle standards and reason by the light of civilized ways, is it not, my friend?",
  "28893": "What about your government and all this treatment?",
  "28894": "What the devil are you doing?",
  "28895": "What help is to be hoped for, what consolation, what solace?",
  "28896": "Or, may we not owe their visit to the dead colt?",
  "28897": "Where shall we search for him?",
  "28898": "Why should you keep such things from me?",
  "28899": "Physiology not an experimental science?",
  "28900": "What about the dough?",
  "28901": "Can she have loved my brother so little as to be able to forget him so soon?",
  "28902": "It wasn't then that she told you?",
  "28903": "What thing?",
  "28904": "Do you suppose she takes you for a symbol?",
  "28905": "No worse news of master, I hope, sir?",
  "28906": "Has she run away because we are come?",
  "28907": "Shall I tell her or not?",
  "28908": "But then, why had he permitted that man to leave him alive?",
  "28909": "What's that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for?",
  "28910": "On which of these actions did he reflect with the most pleasure, when he was summoned by the angel of death?",
  "28911": "How shall I don't?",
  "28912": "What was in there?",
  "28913": "But tell me, what is she?",
  "28914": "Wouldn't you like to be king of that splendid fairyland?",
  "28915": "Have you examined this extract from your report and compared it with the original?",
  "28916": "Is he ungrateful to no one else?",
  "28917": "Aye, how do you know he is?",
  "28918": "Does our friend eke out his modest income with a crossing?",
  "28919": "The stag spoke?",
  "28920": "What are the dangers which menace us?",
  "28921": "Monsieur does not then renounce his excursion for this evening?",
  "28922": "You imagine, I dare say, that you invented something quite new?",
  "28923": "Why shouldn't she win?",
  "28924": "Is there anything in what I say, or am I talking to no purpose?",
  "28925": "Was he already with the queen?",
  "28926": "What is the matter, that with all his ill usage of me, I cannot hate him?",
  "28927": "Now, I beseech you, do tell me, have you ever attended to their pairing and breeding?",
  "28928": "Oh, what have I done to be blessed with such friends?",
  "28929": "Two one pound notes, or friends?",
  "28930": "Can it be that the dog has not understood his master?",
  "28931": "Why indeed should they maintain a watch?",
  "28932": "What was I to do?",
  "28933": "So will you abandon your plan?",
  "28934": "What can I say that will enable you to understand the depth of my sorrow?",
  "28935": "Did she still love him?",
  "28936": "What you 'bout?",
  "28937": "And of the pleasures of love, and all other pleasures, the same holds good?",
  "28938": "What does she want?",
  "28939": "You needn't go yet, need you?",
  "28940": "Will it be safe to leave you there alone?",
  "28941": "How many things she knows, doesn't she?",
  "28942": "In your room?",
  "28943": "Then you won't forgive me?",
  "28944": "Can dignity of mind exist with such trivial cares?",
  "28945": "Ah, friends, do ye divine also my heart's double will?",
  "28946": "Who was th' lad what carried th' flag?",
  "28947": "Are they dead, ma'am?",
  "28948": "And what shall we have in lieu of it?",
  "28949": "It is a lovely night, and why should we not prolong our ride a little?",
  "28950": "Will she then have sufficient native energy to look into herself for comfort, and cultivate her dormant faculties?",
  "28951": "You will not come?",
  "28952": "For arrears of pay?",
  "28953": "Copperfield, my dear fellow, how do you do?",
  "28954": "And is the city which is under a tyrant rich or poor?",
  "28955": "Was it not too clear that, let the matter go how it would, there was no happiness in store for her?",
  "28956": "Would you kindly send one of your constables for two buckets of water?",
  "28957": "But what is there, then, above the sun?",
  "28958": "How is it you don't know?",
  "28959": "Why are they not given up to the church, as they ought to be?",
  "28960": "But you, d'Artagnan, what is the matter with you, and what has happened to you personally?",
  "28961": "To conceal his name?",
  "28962": "Is it at some set season?",
  "28963": "Did she know anything of his life upon the sea?",
  "28964": "Where is so awful a responsibility laid upon them?",
  "28965": "Well, my boy, what's there to prevent you?",
  "28966": "What more natural, after this, than the dream which came to him?",
  "28967": "If vices be genuine and virtue a deception, as you think, why do you call the inventors of that deceiving art sages?",
  "28968": "Has the law any eyes to witness your grief?",
  "28969": "How can I be vain when I know I'm homely?",
  "28970": "The little girl?",
  "28971": "Kicked on that occasion for cheating at dice?",
  "28972": "What proofs do you require?",
  "28973": "On business, eh?",
  "28974": "Why, what's happened?",
  "28975": "Not hurt you, did I?",
  "28976": "Was it the time the sandy cat walked round the balustrade?",
  "28977": "What insults, girl?",
  "28978": "And how does any one know whether he will stay days, months, or years?",
  "28979": "Well, how are you going to get out of that?",
  "28980": "Have you your stethoscope?",
  "28981": "Well, where can we find it?",
  "28982": "Was it mere social effect, fulfilment of ambition in the social world, in the community of mankind?",
  "28983": "How about this ad of yours?",
  "28984": "Do you still suppose that I am a boy ignorant of my own mind, and mistaking the impulses of my own soul?",
  "28985": "Must we then not be married, in order to sanctify the union of our hearts?",
  "28986": "Ay, but will you promise to come?",
  "28987": "What did you write about?",
  "28988": "Perhaps you are laughing again?",
  "28989": "So you think that these people have already quitted the island?",
  "28990": "What's a lad with good friends doing as loblolly boy?",
  "28991": "Who can tell if that mind, when the touchstone is applied to it, will not be found of a mean and vulgar character?",
  "28992": "But what time's breakfast, sir?",
  "28993": "Did you signal us, lording?",
  "28994": "Where was you raised?",
  "28995": "May I read it?",
  "28996": "Where is the treasure?",
  "28997": "You know?",
  "28998": "Snatch at it?",
  "28999": "Well, what say you to a friend that would take this bitter bargain off your hands?",
  "29000": "Just step into this corner a moment, will you?",
  "29001": "What will you do, dear?",
  "29002": "Who shall prevent him?",
  "29003": "Is it a profession?",
  "29004": "You admit you owe him three pounds then for a month's board?",
  "29005": "Have I not found her friendless, and cold, and comfortless?",
  "29006": "Is he learned?",
  "29007": "Ay, where are they?",
  "29008": "Who is there?",
  "29009": "Why should he feel joy at turning back?",
  "29010": "Must I really?",
  "29011": "And shall I not do as the first man?",
  "29012": "Thy work, the KARMA?",
  "29013": "It's queer, isn't it?",
  "29014": "Was I not a fool, when I refused to look at or speak to him?",
  "29015": "And may we say that this has been proven?",
  "29016": "Does she cook the dinner?",
  "29017": "How do you come to know it?",
  "29018": "She was confined at your house, was she not?",
  "29019": "Then why didn't you come to me to wipe them for you?",
  "29020": "Do you know who I am?",
  "29021": "Do you see that woman with the embroidered badge?",
  "29022": "Very well what did I say to you?",
  "29023": "Father, have you any objection to my going away?",
  "29024": "And you are afraid I shall be unhappy?",
  "29025": "To reign in my place and stead?",
  "29026": "I suppose?",
  "29027": "Does the day look clear again?",
  "29028": "What if I were to think a little about others?",
  "29029": "Why on earth did you shut yourself in?",
  "29030": "Do you really suppose?",
  "29031": "Why one to come and one to go?",
  "29032": "Is not that the bishop?",
  "29033": "Why will you ruin yourself, your family, and nation?",
  "29034": "Why such a hard sentence?",
  "29035": "Will he not fancy that the shadows which he formerly saw are truer than the objects which are now shown to him?",
  "29036": "May I go and see her?",
  "29037": "Where did you go this morning?",
  "29038": "So very soon?",
  "29039": "Well, sir, in writing against property, have I done more than quote the language of history?",
  "29040": "I unhappy?",
  "29041": "But do I see a handkerchief?",
  "29042": "But how did he come by his death?",
  "29043": "Can you believe it?",
  "29044": "But if you have big ideas you have to use big words to express them, haven't you?",
  "29045": "Do you think that was done last night?",
  "29046": "Which is the way to the chapel?",
  "29047": "May we, then, be permitted to speak of the past in the present?",
  "29048": "What victim?",
  "29049": "Do we not own the country?",
  "29050": "Raoul, did you ever see anybody hung?",
  "29051": "May I be permitted a word or two of advice?",
  "29052": "If not, where's he gone?",
  "29053": "What would they think of me?",
  "29054": "What says the abbe?",
  "29055": "Might it not be that she would calculate that an interview would thus be possible?",
  "29056": "Why linger to add to the number of the victims of our merciless enemies?",
  "29057": "What is bad?",
  "29058": "And what now?",
  "29059": "Was he actually in hiding from the police?",
  "29060": "Shall he in the meantime risk the character and interest of the nation in the hands of men to whom he can not give his confidence?",
  "29061": "What's the meaning of this?",
  "29062": "In the first place, what is the gentleman's name?",
  "29063": "Don't you want to go out, and walk around the moon, and pick up diamonds?",
  "29064": "But how was it possible to effect this?",
  "29065": "Will you let me?",
  "29066": "And look you, lord, times are not ill, so wherefore should I risk a change of days?",
  "29067": "That certainly seems a satisfactory explanation, does it not?",
  "29068": "Why, I suppose you'll make a dive for a hatful of diamonds, won't you?",
  "29069": "You have my birth certificate?",
  "29070": "Isn't this mattress hard enough, and the room dull enough, and pain bad enough, but THEY must torture me?",
  "29071": "What is our life when compared to theirs?",
  "29072": "Is it an odd speech, papa?",
  "29073": "Why don't we go in with them?",
  "29074": "Had you not observed it before?",
  "29075": "Then why didn't I sneeze?",
  "29076": "Who would attend him when he was sick?",
  "29077": "Till to your very doors the war be brought?",
  "29078": "A sleeping draught?",
  "29079": "Philip?",
  "29080": "But they may come any moment, for you left word that I awaited them?",
  "29081": "Why, indeed?",
  "29082": "Shall you?",
  "29083": "But how came the hand to discompose you so much, if it was only a letter of business?",
  "29084": "Why did this sudden conviction of a religious woman cast a terrible doubt in my mind?",
  "29085": "Was that then he or an inhuman thing moved by a lower soul?",
  "29086": "And the power which the eye possesses is a sort of effluence which is dispensed from the sun?",
  "29087": "What was one to think or feel?",
  "29088": "Can you tell the position of the rooms?",
  "29089": "To defend ourselves against attack?",
  "29090": "The child?",
  "29091": "You will marry me, won't you?",
  "29092": "When shall I have the answer, monseigneur?",
  "29093": "But where does it stay?",
  "29094": "D'you like that?",
  "29095": "You know that to be so?",
  "29096": "Was it possible to render any aid to the dying man?",
  "29097": "Widowed mother, perhaps?",
  "29098": "Has she mentioned me lately?",
  "29099": "And what your sorrow?",
  "29100": "Did you speak, my own?",
  "29101": "Is it only a voice?",
  "29102": "Why wonder about this?",
  "29103": "Did he not advertise?",
  "29104": "In what manner?",
  "29105": "What would they do if they found me?",
  "29106": "But how can I pay them?",
  "29107": "How was this done?",
  "29108": "Away from me?",
  "29109": "And, if so, surely there is good material in you?",
  "29110": "It was he did that, and amn't I a great wonder to think I've traced him ten days with that rent in my crown?",
  "29111": "What was the matter with you, baron?",
  "29112": "May I have the honour?",
  "29113": "Will you come into the garden?",
  "29114": "Will it satisfy them, in the future, if we have nothing to do with invasions and insurrections?",
  "29115": "But what are we to do with her when we have caught her?",
  "29116": "And what do you say of lovers of wine?",
  "29117": "Where now the splendid future of her poor duped children?",
  "29118": "So that is what you wanted the money for?",
  "29119": "Would you like to take her place?",
  "29120": "Was it in the papers yet?",
  "29121": "Who lives to the left there?",
  "29122": "Where shall we have tea?",
  "29123": "Would she ever die?",
  "29124": "And had the leather interior lasted with the felt cap through seven centuries?",
  "29125": "But why should anyone take it in order to keep it in his house?",
  "29126": "What will happen now?",
  "29127": "Next, how can the posting be accomplished in these mountainous parts?",
  "29128": "Does your soul belong to him now?",
  "29129": "How is man to know?",
  "29130": "And what can I do for you, esteemed prince?",
  "29131": "But this letter in which he recommends you to me?",
  "29132": "What are bulbs?",
  "29133": "Would you like to ferry me over?",
  "29134": "I hope your respected father is well, sir?",
  "29135": "And what, my lord, has been my fault?",
  "29136": "Then what is the illness itself?",
  "29137": "Is that what you've been so funny about this evening?",
  "29138": "But you are half asleep, are you not?",
  "29139": "Of whom?",
  "29140": "And suppose I were to die?",
  "29141": "I wonder where they do go, by the by?",
  "29142": "Is the well where you got this water near at hand?",
  "29143": "And does your honor know the four men who undertook to rescue him?",
  "29144": "Did you still hear the knocking?",
  "29145": "But to what place was I to go?",
  "29146": "Would you work for four and a half a week?",
  "29147": "You have a child?",
  "29148": "Doesn't the name of the country strike you even in the mere mention of it?",
  "29149": "How shall we punish him for such a speech?",
  "29150": "What can be plainer than that the webbed feet of ducks and geese are formed for swimming?",
  "29151": "The sun?",
  "29152": "Diana?",
  "29153": "But who was she?",
  "29154": "Have you been in others?",
  "29155": "How died he?",
  "29156": "She asked, if she should call me again?",
  "29157": "You won't mind, will you?",
  "29158": "Have you been there long?",
  "29159": "Do I interrupt?",
  "29160": "But it is quite understood, is it not?",
  "29161": "Will you carry him?",
  "29162": "Neither will he ever break faith where there have been oaths or agreements?",
  "29163": "If he comes back again, father?",
  "29164": "But who can tell what had happened?",
  "29165": "What then, I shall be asked, prevents these things from taking place with such regularity and precision?",
  "29166": "Who is the lady?",
  "29167": "Ain't it good enough to be in your book?",
  "29168": "And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?",
  "29169": "Is it not a just retribution?",
  "29170": "And where are the bodies?",
  "29171": "What do you say to coffee?",
  "29172": "Then we are friends?",
  "29173": "What are you thinking of, D'Artagnan?",
  "29174": "It was four years ago that I had it made, and what do you think I chose for the word and figures?",
  "29175": "Can I have missed it?",
  "29176": "Krajiek could 'a' put it there, couldn't he?",
  "29177": "WHICH candle?",
  "29178": "Shall we take their horses out, or tell them to find friends elsewhere as they best can?",
  "29179": "How much longer will you stay here?",
  "29180": "Is yours a hooky or a nobbly?",
  "29181": "And if he were innocent of any wrong, why did he not do something to clear himself?",
  "29182": "And it is to you, you graceless varlet, I owe all this?",
  "29183": "I have spoken of this because I keep wanting to know for a fact whether other people feel such enjoyment?",
  "29184": "Who is the fellow with him?",
  "29185": "And what will happen now?",
  "29186": "Can we be so unwise as to mean, that she shall keep a navy in our harbours for that purpose?",
  "29187": "Well, I don't think there's anything more, is there?",
  "29188": "Do you think that you are going to stay here?",
  "29189": "Are you going away, or has something happened?",
  "29190": "At the point where the path passes through the gate, you could surely pick up the tracks?",
  "29191": "What have we for lunch?",
  "29192": "Then it's a go, eh?",
  "29193": "What is't?",
  "29194": "Because she was there?",
  "29195": "Can you, of all the people who love her, bear to see her so?",
  "29196": "And if we had not arrived, what would you have done?",
  "29197": "Should you like me to take down his hat to him?",
  "29198": "Honest?",
  "29199": "Are all the flowers dead, or do some of them come again in the summer?",
  "29200": "Can one work there?",
  "29201": "Doing?",
  "29202": "I mean, will you be good to us, or do you intend to eat us?",
  "29203": "Will there be roses?",
  "29204": "Who gives you your maintenance, I pray you?",
  "29205": "What makes you pant so, my friend?",
  "29206": "Is it his fault that he is so ugly, and has so little sense?",
  "29207": "And what due or proper thing is given by cookery, and to what?",
  "29208": "Leave him there after what has occurred this morning in this palace?",
  "29209": "Do you take me vor a shicken ?",
  "29210": "Wot good are you?",
  "29211": "What are you to do?",
  "29212": "And why do you ask that?",
  "29213": "What is it, grandmother?",
  "29214": "What's the good of stopping?",
  "29215": "Had I right, for my own benefit, to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations?",
  "29216": "Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?",
  "29217": "You will reach that with nothing to help you but credit?",
  "29218": "By whose means?",
  "29219": "How much do you own?",
  "29220": "And the lakes, cousin, what do you say of them?",
  "29221": "Why don't you go and fetch things?",
  "29222": "Is that possible?",
  "29223": "What do you mean by lagging and a lifer?",
  "29224": "Are there no honest ones?",
  "29225": "And what is THAT to me?",
  "29226": "Are you unwell today?",
  "29227": "Phips had compromised, and why not he?",
  "29228": "To the office?",
  "29229": "Why should he bear all this?",
  "29230": "Successfully, I hope?",
  "29231": "Have you not heard the astonishing intelligence regarding her surreptitious union?",
  "29232": "Yet, what have I got to do with it?",
  "29233": "Still he's not worth her little finger, is he?",
  "29234": "Is the baby all right?",
  "29235": "Has she been stolen?",
  "29236": "Why must she do it?",
  "29237": "And by what means our news to him repeat?",
  "29238": "What in the world was the meaning of this?",
  "29239": "Is it possible that this stranger has now become everything to me?",
  "29240": "Forgive me, won't you, and let me put the poor brute out of his misery?",
  "29241": "The question arises, what disposition are we to make of our accumulating funds?",
  "29242": "Is it of any use for me to tell you again why we must try to part with the house?",
  "29243": "How comes it that you would not answer my greetings for so long?",
  "29244": "And what did the firm say?",
  "29245": "You do think I could do some good at it, if I were to try?",
  "29246": "But what is to be done, old man?",
  "29247": "As they are or as they appear?",
  "29248": "I didn't do wrong, did I?",
  "29249": "What do I want with them?",
  "29250": "Where is that secretary person?",
  "29251": "What could he do, even supposing himself strong enough to fight the battle?",
  "29252": "Can one be too much alive, too happy?",
  "29253": "Who are to be the objects of popular choice?",
  "29254": "But will not the general be too hospitable for you?",
  "29255": "And that's the lad, sir, is it?",
  "29256": "Which road?",
  "29257": "And me?",
  "29258": "Oh, so it's not time to die yet?",
  "29259": "And how is it he has got this power over you, that you promise to marry him against your will?",
  "29260": "How could the devil from hell himself escape alive?",
  "29261": "Why don't you leave him alone?",
  "29262": "And why so late returned?",
  "29263": "What about leaving that bright boy of yours on guard?",
  "29264": "Did ye ever know this?",
  "29265": "Are you content, my beloved?",
  "29266": "Ye that tell us of harmony and reconciliation, can ye restore to us the time that is past?",
  "29267": "If they had said I was niece to a piping bullfinch, what would you care?",
  "29268": "Have you served under the usurper?",
  "29269": "You would want nothing for so doing?",
  "29270": "What's injudicious, hey?",
  "29271": "Who of you heard his evil song?",
  "29272": "On you?",
  "29273": "Why have you come?",
  "29274": "What have I ever known?",
  "29275": "How many times do I love again?",
  "29276": "Then I may reckon on it, your excellency?",
  "29277": "You have heard me?",
  "29278": "You're the son of one and the nephew of the other?",
  "29279": "And at what date?",
  "29280": "Is he to go up for examination?",
  "29281": "Old lady?",
  "29282": "Have you found it?",
  "29283": "Isn't there any help for it?",
  "29284": "Who speaks for this cub?",
  "29285": "Is it not very unwise in us to go on spending the little money we've got when I can keep down expenditures by an honest occupation?",
  "29286": "What ought they to be allowed, or not allowed, to do, be, and suffer?",
  "29287": "How long have you been there?",
  "29288": "Do you wish for a name?",
  "29289": "But what, miss?",
  "29290": "And you never by any chance lose sight of him, I presume?",
  "29291": "Should we go now?",
  "29292": "How is one to vanish partly?",
  "29293": "Who was it that was eaten?",
  "29294": "Can I have another piece?",
  "29295": "Where is the use of the devil in that sentence?",
  "29296": "Whereabouts?",
  "29297": "It is awful, love, isn't it?",
  "29298": "Yet how can I let this knavish dog die and lose the money?",
  "29299": "Or how bear the expense of such a journey?",
  "29300": "I am to drag my present life on, holding its pains at your pleasure, day by day?",
  "29301": "One and all?",
  "29302": "And will the inspection have to be made now?",
  "29303": "You do not understand?",
  "29304": "Always ready?",
  "29305": "Can you get a few men together to go there?",
  "29306": "Shall we allege a musical dispute?",
  "29307": "Is it riveted to the planks?",
  "29308": "What, then, possessed him?",
  "29309": "Have you got it?",
  "29310": "Do you believe you have still a certain amount of it to expend this evening?",
  "29311": "Won't anything make you understand that?",
  "29312": "Wouldn't you rather sit here?",
  "29313": "Then why in the world not?",
  "29314": "What are they then?",
  "29315": "What can you love me for?",
  "29316": "Is he a presentable sort of a person?",
  "29317": "Why do you talk like this to THEM?",
  "29318": "But what was his name?",
  "29319": "What do you mean by gone?",
  "29320": "But why don't you want to take it?",
  "29321": "Is not it what you have often wished to do yourself?",
  "29322": "Would a boat be waiting for us with supplies and letters?",
  "29323": "What must have been his feelings?",
  "29324": "And shall we ever come into our own again?",
  "29325": "What do you want, my pretty?",
  "29326": "Supposing him to be attached to me, would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?",
  "29327": "But suppose she had run against this piece of iron?",
  "29328": "Who will be the jury?",
  "29329": "You think, then, that you can help me more efficaciously than your brothers?",
  "29330": "And do you think it's true?",
  "29331": "Shall there never be a fresh opportunity of trying the ranges of projectiles?",
  "29332": "Did he wake up?",
  "29333": "Was he nice?",
  "29334": "And now what will we do?",
  "29335": "Do you not know?",
  "29336": "Or, perhaps, you are not unprepared for the announcement I have it in charge to make?",
  "29337": "And if that were the case would your honor condemn his action?",
  "29338": "And during these days what shall I do?",
  "29339": "Don't the knives hurt?",
  "29340": "Where have you come from and what is your name?",
  "29341": "But how shall we get back?",
  "29342": "How many of the zechins, your father saved, are still left?",
  "29343": "What are your additions?",
  "29344": "What are the foundations of inequality?",
  "29345": "How did you get it?",
  "29346": "One of those swabs, was he?",
  "29347": "Do you believe he can?",
  "29348": "Who has seen her?",
  "29349": "What did he mean by such a pagan idea?",
  "29350": "Was it because at that time we passed for very rich people, and you were afraid of being refused?",
  "29351": "And besides, what have I done to bring it about?",
  "29352": "Alas, what shall I wretched wight become?",
  "29353": "But suppose it's a woman?",
  "29354": "Why am I to give an account of myself?",
  "29355": "What's that you tell me?",
  "29356": "But you think she wouldn't come?",
  "29357": "What colorable reason could be assigned, in a country so situated, for such vast augmentations of the military force?",
  "29358": "Is this too little?",
  "29359": "For the last three months?",
  "29360": "What could he reply to the deposition of the gendarmes who had arrested him in the very act?",
  "29361": "Where is thy answer, culprit?",
  "29362": "Should a man be considered disgraced because he is deceived, because he is betrayed, robbed?",
  "29363": "You are recovering again?",
  "29364": "What are you blurting out NOW?",
  "29365": "Shall we yield to force?",
  "29366": "Come, I do not ask for the sake of questioning you, but how did you get in?",
  "29367": "What do you wish, gentlemen?",
  "29368": "What does she?",
  "29369": "What, then, is the use of your worship?",
  "29370": "Was the gate open?",
  "29371": "Shall us begin it now?",
  "29372": "A recruit, sir, I understand?",
  "29373": "Sir?",
  "29374": "Yet could a woman who had done even what she had done deserve all this?",
  "29375": "But who would do it?",
  "29376": "Has not your father already his sixth wife?",
  "29377": "I ask, is it not as good a rule for him as it is for me?",
  "29378": "WHAT do you call him?",
  "29379": "Who is coward now?",
  "29380": "Have they nothing better to do?",
  "29381": "But that's remarkably altruistic of you, isn't it?",
  "29382": "Are you feeling any better?",
  "29383": "Do you think I care more for my dress than for my little girl?",
  "29384": "What man of taste and feeling can endure rifacimenti, harmonies, abridgments, expurgated editions?",
  "29385": "Faucheux?",
  "29386": "And do you think that you would be happy with her, or she with you, after what has passed?",
  "29387": "Do you ask their pardon of me?",
  "29388": "Who can possibly have told you I had had that dream?",
  "29389": "And this is the return you make me for all the indulgences I've heaped on you?",
  "29390": "Why not raise it five more?",
  "29391": "Will you let me tell you?",
  "29392": "You allow me?",
  "29393": "A week?",
  "29394": "And yet what else was she to think?",
  "29395": "Say, was my mother rightly slain or not?",
  "29396": "But where is this devotion?",
  "29397": "Where have I got one?",
  "29398": "Does not that content you?",
  "29399": "And what is the difference?",
  "29400": "Why are you merry?",
  "29401": "If you really cannot come to me will you let me come to you?",
  "29402": "What matters it of whom he spoke?",
  "29403": "What did it matter if the message were not intended for him?",
  "29404": "Was ever a respectable gentleman in such an impasse?",
  "29405": "Peas?",
  "29406": "You won't forget how fond you are of me?",
  "29407": "What's the matter now?",
  "29408": "Where is this great spider of yours now?",
  "29409": "What have you done now?",
  "29410": "Did you see nobody concealed while you were there?",
  "29411": "Besides what have we to do with setting the world at defiance?",
  "29412": "It looks as if you were trying to fleece me?",
  "29413": "But why suspect me before the action?",
  "29414": "And you live here?",
  "29415": "What mean you?",
  "29416": "That's good impartial evidence, ain't it?",
  "29417": "Do you think for one moment that this little haystack is enough to feed all the flocks in the whole district?",
  "29418": "What is there more astonishing in all that I have said to you than in what you have told me?",
  "29419": "You will not help me, then?",
  "29420": "Surely you have gone too far?",
  "29421": "But I don't exactly see how we can do that?",
  "29422": "Why should he do it?",
  "29423": "But don't you think she'll know all about it, just the same?",
  "29424": "What is the business you wish to see her about?",
  "29425": "Is there anything more?",
  "29426": "Would you deprive me of one of the most indispensable of my means of livelihood?",
  "29427": "Why, how is this?",
  "29428": "What have made you so down?",
  "29429": "And where may he be now?",
  "29430": "The last time that I see him?",
  "29431": "What is her secret?",
  "29432": "Isn't there some nice girl who'd read and amuse you?",
  "29433": "Have you made this trip before?",
  "29434": "Doesn't that satisfy you?",
  "29435": "I say, stranger, how are ye?",
  "29436": "Is not this so?",
  "29437": "How long were you there?",
  "29438": "Wherein?",
  "29439": "Where, may I ask?",
  "29440": "Who is in this world?",
  "29441": "Doesn't join in with the lads in their games, to get some sort of excitement in this lonely place?",
  "29442": "Well, I wait patiently, do I not?",
  "29443": "Shall I have a cab called?",
  "29444": "And then your negotiations will fail?",
  "29445": "It looks newer than the other things?",
  "29446": "She what?",
  "29447": "Should you like me to stay away?",
  "29448": "What had I to do with him that he should rob me of my sleep?",
  "29449": "Will master come here a moment?",
  "29450": "Can there be an appearance of that which has no form?",
  "29451": "Shall we not?",
  "29452": "Where are you going, you rogue?",
  "29453": "And you are very happy?",
  "29454": "You won't have anything?",
  "29455": "Whither shall I bear my shame?",
  "29456": "What's up, then?",
  "29457": "Of what use are excursions into realms in which no real fruit can ever be gathered?",
  "29458": "And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth?",
  "29459": "But why these workingman's clothes?",
  "29460": "And pray what is the ether?",
  "29461": "But there was some one there?",
  "29462": "Have you already in your mind a plan wholly or partially formed?",
  "29463": "Does he gamble?",
  "29464": "And you are certain that the queen and he did not see each other?",
  "29465": "Shall I go up and see?",
  "29466": "What have they come there to do?",
  "29467": "Do you know I think them exceedingly entertaining and strange?",
  "29468": "Will you let me take your arm as far as my own door?",
  "29469": "How's your wound?",
  "29470": "Did you not say that the dog's name was Z?",
  "29471": "Of what use are these dangerous visits, since we can't recognize him?",
  "29472": "You are the officer on duty, lieutenant of the musketeers, are you?",
  "29473": "Who said anything about killing?",
  "29474": "For the emperor's return?",
  "29475": "Can't you see you've made a mistake?",
  "29476": "Can we safely base our action upon any such vague inference?",
  "29477": "Did tha' do anythin' extra to make thysel' so strong?",
  "29478": "Or do ye go in bare bones, as I may say?",
  "29479": "Now, what is the evidence presented to this body by one of its committees?",
  "29480": "Liza, do you despise me?",
  "29481": "Come, are you ready?",
  "29482": "Has she ever had any experience?",
  "29483": "What does he want, then?",
  "29484": "Are you tired of me?",
  "29485": "And why should it be set aside?",
  "29486": "You see?",
  "29487": "Is not that the empress with him there?",
  "29488": "We only want to find out whether it is yes or no, don't we?",
  "29489": "For everything?",
  "29490": "Is it in anger or in spite that you wish to go?",
  "29491": "Paid everybody?",
  "29492": "Will the greedy gullet of the penitentiary be satisfied with swallowing him instead of all of them, if they should venture to obey him?",
  "29493": "You will come and see me again before you go, chevalier?",
  "29494": "Why should you say such desperate things?",
  "29495": "You must promise me you'll tell no one else?",
  "29496": "It isn't putting you out or upsetting your plans, I hope, or anything on those lines?",
  "29497": "What's that?",
  "29498": "Not here?",
  "29499": "Birdsburg?",
  "29500": "The count, then, is in the chateau?",
  "29501": "What did you go to the bandstand for?",
  "29502": "But what do you mean by living only for yourself?",
  "29503": "Why, know you not?",
  "29504": "Don't you love me?",
  "29505": "But may I not see my poor child?",
  "29506": "Gone down again?",
  "29507": "Whither are you going?",
  "29508": "How is that letter signed?",
  "29509": "I know you'll excuse the precautions of affection, won't you?",
  "29510": "After all, what's the odds between me and you?",
  "29511": "What rule of political morals trampled under foot?",
  "29512": "Does he play?",
  "29513": "Steerforth?",
  "29514": "Can I help loving him?",
  "29515": "And where was it?",
  "29516": "What will they leave him?",
  "29517": "How can I cross the desert?",
  "29518": "How did you get the idea?",
  "29519": "You were going to drink my wine?",
  "29520": "What's 'cordeon?",
  "29521": "Will you let me?",
  "29522": "Meet?",
  "29523": "Where are you going to next?",
  "29524": "Would it not be so, mother, if we were to meet him in fact?",

  "29776": "What, I suppose you think I don't know you?",
  "29777": "How can what he and you said be untrue?",
  "29778": "Is it that you won't come in because you wish to stand here, and think over the past hours of enjoyment?",
  "29779": "But what of that?",
  "29780": "Were we not brought up together?",
  "29781": "Can I bear the consciousness that every endearment he bestows is a sacrifice made on principle?",
  "29782": "Why do you torment me about what you might all see?",
  "29783": "But what do you do on active service?",
  "29784": "Carried off?",
  "29785": "Yes, brigadier?",
  "29786": "Writes for the stage, does he?",
  "29787": "And wherefore were you called away just now?",
  "29788": "How do you find them?",
  "29789": "Where did it come from?",
  "29790": "And do not the natures of men and women differ very much indeed?",

  "29792": "What could I say to them?",
  "29793": "I hope we have not tired you?",
  "29794": "Capitally, warmly said, wasn't it?",
  "29795": "Well, and then?",
  "29796": "You do not find it easy to advise me?",
  "29797": "Is that, in truth, worthy of thanks?",
  "29798": "Come and take a walk, my dear?",
  "29799": "Do you really not know?",
  "29800": "You'll be on hand tomorrow at one o'clock, won't you?",

  "29822": "How were these double claims to ceremonious respect happening at the same time to be managed?",
  "29823": "What is to be done?",
  "29824": "You dirty scoundrel, is this the way you leave me?",
  "29825": "Would the interior acclivities of the crater be practicable?",
  "29826": "Where is this wedding to take place, and when?",
  "29827": "Is it the physical differences of blood, color and cranial measurements?",

  "29847": "Is it flowers you are strewing?",
  "29848": "Why don't you stay down town and go to the theatre with me?",
  "29849": "Would you call one of them virtue and the other vice?",
  "29850": "And you met no one?",
  "29851": "Didn't you notice it?",
  "29852": "Numerous?",
  "29853": "But you feel solitude an oppression?",
  "29854": "She's her brother's heir, is she not?",
  "29855": "When do we hear of women, who starting out of obscurity, boldly claim respect on account of their great abilities or daring virtues?",

  "29924": "And will you get him first thing in the morning?",
  "29925": "What will you do with the light?",
  "29926": "Have you come up determined not to deal?",
  "29927": "You have heard and understood what your granddaughter has been saying, sir, have you?",
  "29928": "What could they desire beyond their liberty?",
  "29929": "Edlin?",
  "29930": "What shall we do with him?",
  "29931": "Is not thy common talk found aphorisms?",
  "29932": "I should like to deal him a blow, but can I actually do it?",
  "29933": "Do you know what time your father will be back?",
  "29934": "But who, then, is this assassin, this murderer?",
  "29935": "Why did he urge me so little about the princess?",
  "29936": "What is the meaning of their eternal care and worry?",
  "29937": "Were his eyes deceiving him?",
  "29938": "Why this ridiculous mania for affirming that every thing has been said, which means that we know all about mental and moral science?",
  "29939": "And you spoke to him?",
  "29940": "What's the trouble?",
  "29941": "Give who?",
  "29942": "Anything else?",
  "29943": "Are you mad enough to leave this house?",
  "29944": "How long have you been engaged in the practice of medicine?",
  "29945": "What of it?",
  "29946": "Then it will be our duty to select, if we can, natures which are fitted for the task of guarding the city?",
  "29947": "Why not end my misery now rather than drag out a few more wretched days in this dark pit?",
  "29948": "Why did you lend an ear to the temptings of friends?",
  "29949": "What do you understand of the affair?",
  "29950": "Are we to pass the night in the king's room?",
  "29951": "Not about money, I hope?",
  "29952": "Extraordinary, did you say?",
  "29953": "Why should you interfere?",
  "29954": "She doesn't know yet?",
  "29955": "Gania, what are you standing there for?",
  "29956": "But why, of all others, choose these?",
  "29957": "Ever so little did you say, gossip?",
  "29958": "Are you in need of soothsaying?",
  "29959": "An incendiary, then?",
  "29960": "To come at call?",
  "29961": "Have I time?",
  "29962": "Do they live?",
  "29963": "And this is all?",
  "29964": "You mean that you want to go away from me?",
  "29965": "Now, my friends, can the country be saved upon that basis?",
  "29966": "What, billing so sweetly?",
  "29967": "Well, then what of it?",
  "29968": "What would my islanders say when they heard their governor was going, strolling about on the winds?",
  "29969": "And in that case there's no reason on earth why you shouldn't go back?",
  "29970": "But, guardian, may we not hope that a little experience will teach him what a false and wretched thing it is?",
  "29971": "Have you told them to bring the horse?",
  "29972": "What are we doing?",
  "29973": "Well, did you see them fly?",
  "29974": "What are you up to?",
  "29975": "And that's why you trust him, eh?",
  "29976": "And what does he think of it?",
  "29977": "What sort of an education could they have got in the country?",
  "29978": "How do you go back?",
  "29979": "How old is your sister?",
  "29980": "Who are you, sir, and by what right do you touch this gentleman's papers?",
  "29981": "Were they in the tent?",
  "29982": "Some poaching case, no doubt?",
  "29983": "What is that for?",
  "29984": "On what occasion?",
  "29985": "But were there no reasons why I should avoid you?",
  "29986": "Would it not be of some assistance, if we knew of what substance it is composed?",
  "29987": "Mustn't it be splendid to be remarkable and have compositions written about you after you're dead?",
  "29988": "Had she only been guilty of silence as to his fate?",
  "29989": "Shall I take it down for you?",
  "29990": "What about, papa?",
  "29991": "But I suppose there is no fire?",
  "29992": "Why should she talk of her own unhappiness?",
  "29993": "The whole picture ruined, isn't it so?",
  "29994": "Am I not he that has been conquered?",
  "29995": "Surely you won't have to make another for me?",
  "29996": "Where do you suppose him to be?",
  "29997": "And what means are ours, of attaining the truth?",
  "29998": "You mean?",
  "29999": "Please, sir, be this note for you?",
  "30000": "Surely I can never have seriously written such a silly motto as that?",
  "30001": "Have you made up your mind when you shall be there yourself?",
  "30002": "Need it go on?",
  "30003": "What was going on in that mind which was so young and yet already so impenetrable?",
  "30004": "Couldn't he have some spark of manhood about him?",
  "30005": "What shall become of this?",
  "30006": "But how was this to be done, when he had no revenue, often not means enough for necessary expenses?",
  "30007": "What steps have you taken?",
  "30008": "But what's the name of your chief?",
  "30009": "And now?",
  "30010": "What was that they said?",
  "30011": "Why should any one murder a man in so clumsy a fashion as by hanging him?",
  "30012": "Stands the wind in that quarter?",
  "30013": "Is it really true, what every one says, that you cut off one of the ogre's arms?",
  "30014": "Should he knock as of old?",
  "30015": "Nothing about the silver calabash he spat into?",
  "30016": "But what availeth it?",
  "30017": "Where then lay the spots of commonness?",
  "30018": "That seems strange to you, doesn't it?",
  "30019": "Who will volunteer for the job?",
  "30020": "How do we stand in point of time, constable, eh?",
  "30021": "Did I not promise?",
  "30022": "Well, who said it was?",
  "30023": "I suppose your people all do this?",
  "30024": "Did anyone send you, sir?",
  "30025": "What then do you know?",
  "30026": "But where could a dog have come from?",
  "30027": "What shall I do with this beastly tumbril?",
  "30028": "Do I excuse her for it?",
  "30029": "Who is it that compels them to borne along?",
  "30030": "Did any of you gentlemen want to have it out with ME?",
  "30031": "Am I not a madman, and therefore irresponsible?",
  "30032": "How am I afraid of myself?",
  "30033": "Where am I?",
  "30034": "Did he before?",
  "30035": "Do you want her?",
  "30036": "To what, then, do we owe these blessings?",
  "30037": "Runic?",
  "30038": "I say, shall we soon be clear?",
  "30039": "Slid, sir, what should you behold in my face, sir, that should move you, as they say, sir, to ask me, sir, if I would sell my rapier?",
  "30040": "Am I worth anything now, since you have got into such high favor?",
  "30041": "Will nothing make you understand?",
  "30042": "And are thy deeds so good?",
  "30043": "This young cavalier, who won't have me?",
  "30044": "Tell me would you rob?",
  "30045": "Ah, it's you?",
  "30046": "What more can the devil do than strangle us?",
  "30047": "Anything more?",
  "30048": "What does it matter, when you come to think of it, whether a child is yours by blood or not?",
  "30049": "I passed you on the road?",
  "30050": "And what makes you think?",
  "30051": "Is he come back, then?",
  "30052": "Is their race extinct?",
  "30053": "Why do you cast those anxious looks on each other?",
  "30054": "Finished what, may I ask?",
  "30055": "Why, they say, is he not perfect in his training?",
  "30056": "Just now, don't you find something uncomfortable, disquieting, alarming in the atmosphere of this room?",
  "30057": "Njal went on to ask, whether he had a right of action against all of them, or whether the leaders had to answer for them all in the suit?",
  "30058": "Will you swear it?",
  "30059": "Does your excellency wish for a receipt?",
  "30060": "What experiment?",
  "30061": "How can varieties of soil engender a principle of legislation and politics?",
  "30062": "What do I know about business?",
  "30063": "But what must they deserve, then, who set him to work?",
  "30064": "But why?",
  "30065": "What would you like best to do?",
  "30066": "Meditatin', eh?",
  "30067": "Next time you roust me out, you hear?",
  "30068": "But it's not serious?",
  "30069": "We knew you were going to get married, did we?",
  "30070": "Why make a long story of what took but five minutes to do?",
  "30071": "Why with disgust?",
  "30072": "What mill?",
  "30073": "What evil spirit has taken possession of your heart that you should be so wicked?",
  "30074": "Whether a profound genius, or a sure judgment?",
  "30075": "Why should you love me?",
  "30076": "Will not the landholder know and feel whatever will promote or insure the interest of landed property?",
  "30077": "Have you heard of her good fortune?",
  "30078": "These bodies serve us?",
  "30079": "Hippolyte?",
  "30080": "Tell me, do you love me?",
  "30081": "Are you angry with me?",
  "30082": "And if they were glad to have you, why should I have brought you away?",
  "30083": "Chopin's style, then, was not original?",
  "30084": "Do you desire me to go?",
  "30085": "Will that moderation be aided or impaired by the addition of a sovereign?",
  "30086": "What d'ye think the old fornicator saith?",
  "30087": "But when he comes to his box?",
  "30088": "Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?",
  "30089": "And who told you to defend the king?",

  "30095": "Tell us what you require?",
  "30096": "What papers?",
  "30097": "Wot do you look at a man so for?",
  "30098": "And for what purpose?",
  "30099": "I now calm?",
  "30100": "What do you want to do?",
  "30101": "Agents?",
  "30102": "And woven the thread into cloth?",
  "30103": "Have you undertaken the task to enrich me in this world?",
  "30104": "Did their zeal flag or their courage fail?",
  "30105": "Why should he have said that I was a nuisance to the whole country?",
  "30106": "How, then, shall we explain this change?",
  "30107": "Even if I were to scrape off the gold?",
  "30108": "Computation, if two to one against two, how many against five?",
  "30109": "How could that be, monsieur?",

  "30131": "Is that your church, sir?",
  "30132": "Does he think I haven't got any eyes?",
  "30133": "Did they exert themselves to help onward the great movement of the human race, or to stop it?",
  "30134": "And what is their cause?",
  "30135": "But what did we do?",
  "30136": "Two shortest months?",
  "30137": "Knew what, my dear?",
  "30138": "What good is there in waiting?",

  "30147": "Have you never done anything you regret?",
  "30148": "How did they know, they said, that the weather would keep fine?",
  "30149": "Then you won't have the same lessons as I shall?",
  "30150": "And what happened then?",
  "30151": "But is that a fact?",
  "30152": "We have to ask, in what respects does the interrelation between mind and body resemble the relation between a coat and a nail?",
  "30153": "What is the matter?",
  "30154": "And the steamboat?",
  "30155": "She went back to that place?",
  "30156": "Have you sufficiently observed the wonders it covers, its fishes, its zoophytes, its parterres of sponges, and its forests of coral?",
  "30157": "Why do you run so, mamma?",
  "30158": "Who wants your love, man?",
  "30159": "Rather out of condition still, hey?",
  "30160": "Was it outside, in the air?",
  "30161": "What would he think?",
  "30162": "That charming young woman with her is her daughter?",
  "30163": "Found your way up here?",
  "30164": "You can read?",
  "30165": "How can you let her?",

  "30170": "When you might be doing decent work among us out there?",
  "30171": "How could she serve me?",
  "30172": "But why have two of each sort?",
  "30173": "Does he not call the other pleasures necessary, under the idea that if there were no necessity for them, he would rather not have them?",
  "30174": "You'd like her for your honeymoon?",
  "30175": "For what are you, my young friend?",
  "30176": "Then you don't think I'll see him again?",
  "30177": "And yet you come here, and tell me such a dreadful lie as you did just now, eh?",
  "30178": "Well, sir, what of this?",
  "30179": "Will you?",
  "30180": "I could not see a woman murdered?",
  "30181": "Do you hear me, some of you?",
  "30182": "If I flee from her, there's a law to punish me?",
  "30183": "Can you not guess?",
  "30184": "Who knows what will come in sight round the bend of the valley there?",
  "30185": "What's the last joke?",
  "30186": "How then do service which offends his shade?",
  "30187": "Then you were not engaged to marry him?",
  "30188": "Did not you ask it for anything?",
  "30189": "Can I speak with him?",
  "30190": "And to feel not exactly dull, but sad?",
  "30191": "Was it near, was it far?",
  "30192": "Wouldn't you, ferryman, like to accept these clothes, which are a nuisance to me, from me?",
  "30193": "Isn't he?",
  "30194": "Neither, I said, can there be any question that the guardian who is to keep anything should have eyes rather than no eyes?",
  "30195": "Damn it, did you then take me along with you for your chaplain, to sing mass and shrive you?",
  "30196": "You asked me for five hundred men, did you not?",
  "30197": "Your mother won't know, and so what's the harm?",
  "30198": "What is the liberty of the press?",
  "30199": "Would she throw away the inestimable advantage of royal protection?",
  "30200": "In whom can we trust?",
  "30201": "Then how is it that you did not go?",
  "30202": "And what reward have they?",
  "30203": "Shan't we try that?",
  "30204": "Would you care to try it?",
  "30205": "See what, sir?",
  "30206": "What else could I say when he asked me?",
  "30207": "Are you willing to carry us through the air wherever we wish to go?",
  "30208": "Suppose it was all a gigantic mistake?",
  "30209": "Why out of the question?",
  "30210": "Is your secret of enough importance to me to spare your life for it?",
  "30211": "Oh?",
  "30212": "What more can I desire?",
  "30213": "What would he say then?",
  "30214": "Where are these lamps?",
  "30215": "Who, mother?",
  "30216": "You are studying topography?",
  "30217": "What rent do you pay here?",
  "30218": "Now, do you want any more?",
  "30219": "Is there anything wrong?",
  "30220": "How could that be possible?",
  "30221": "Hadn't I better have a shave?",
  "30222": "How could angels bear the sight?",
  "30223": "You think it then possible that they really won't have returned?",
  "30224": "What's the answer?",
  "30225": "What do you mean by the proposal you made just now?",
  "30226": "I surmise you also are quits?",
  "30227": "What sort of wood is't?",
  "30228": "Can't any one make him stop?",
  "30229": "Do you consider me so?",
  "30230": "How do I know what I was before?",
  "30231": "Shall I see you again ere my departure?",
  "30232": "Am I alarmed?",
  "30233": "How long a start have they?",
  "30234": "In the second, whence comes it?",
  "30235": "What, monsieur?",
  "30236": "Didn't ye hear a word about them matters and something more, eh?",
  "30237": "Till at last he be?",
  "30238": "And what was there in a simple curl of fair hair to appall that brutal man, familiar with every form of cruelty?",
  "30239": "In love with HER?",
  "30240": "But we would agree to make him rich enough to live, I suppose?",
  "30241": "Would a tablespoon of vanilla be enough for a small layer cake?",
  "30242": "Because I've ordered fiz?",
  "30243": "But why do I say, in this case?",
  "30244": "He will be superintendent?",
  "30245": "Your sentence of death, if any soul hears you?",
  "30246": "What embarrassment?",
  "30247": "How do you do, dear friend?",
  "30248": "Have you got the key, auntie?",
  "30249": "What's a captive?",
  "30250": "Can that, with any sort of justice, be styled a blunder?",
  "30251": "But may I not write a note to tell him why I cannot come?",
  "30252": "Meanin' aour packets?",
  "30253": "Why did he do it?",
  "30254": "Has his housekeeper gone too?",
  "30255": "What do you like?",
  "30256": "You have observed that?",
  "30257": "She and I were like sisters, and now she is gone, will you not let me be like a sister to you in your trouble?",
  "30258": "And is there any opposite to life?",
  "30259": "Well?",
  "30260": "Don't you think that people are most conceited of all about their sensual powers?",
  "30261": "What am I to do if I love nothing but fame and men's esteem?",
  "30262": "What do you see there?",
  "30263": "How should a man tell you who knows everything?",
  "30264": "Of what did he die?",
  "30265": "The convicts?",
  "30266": "Why should I help a man to the means perhaps of winning all I have, unless I considered him my friend?",
  "30267": "Don't you know that their attorneys have noticed us that they have withdrawn the suit?",
  "30268": "Who was ever successful in true love?",
  "30269": "Don't you see that by the very fact of your choosing her you prove that you do not know what is best for you?",
  "30270": "Does he?",
  "30271": "Can't you take my word?",
  "30272": "Don't you feel it, don't you feel you CAN'T be tortured into any more knowledge?",
  "30273": "Why should we not get him?",
  "30274": "Ladislaw?",
  "30275": "Does he accept?",
  "30276": "Could it be possible that she should her have to encounter another amorous swain?",
  "30277": "If I catch him there again, shall I have the right to thrash him and her also?",
  "30278": "Is not this the time for us to go back?",
  "30279": "Very reserved, isn't he?",
  "30280": "Ha, what?",
  "30281": "If so, whose?",
  "30282": "And what do you want to do now?",
  "30283": "And the windows too?",
  "30284": "But do you know, gentlemen, what was the chief point about my spite?",
  "30285": "Is there anything the matter, father?",
  "30286": "How do you cure the shivers?",
  "30287": "You have lost one of your boots?",
  "30288": "How comes it that he is unknown?",
  "30289": "What sort of a man is that?",
  "30290": "You have been into the church?",
  "30291": "Is it so beautiful as all that?",
  "30292": "Well, what are you doing there, then?",
  "30293": "Are you used to burglary, may I ask?",
  "30294": "Can't I come back to your rooms?",
  "30295": "And you are NOT, I presume, eh?",
  "30296": "I wonder why?",
  "30297": "Would he come and see her in spite of his mother?",
  "30298": "Wouldn't you rather come in here, to me?",
  "30299": "And what did they see?",
  "30300": "What sort of lives do the majority of folk lead?",
  "30301": "What in the act of offering?",
  "30302": "What could I say, what could I do?",
  "30303": "Know you which, of all his wives, possessed these in the highest degree?",
  "30304": "If they do this, how are we to know when they mean what they say, and of what value can their evidence on points of culture be reckoned?",
  "30305": "Then the soul is immortal?",
  "30306": "Yes, yes, it's your sting, and you are a wasp, that's what you are, a wasp, do you hear?",
  "30307": "Can a man be too cruel to his mother's enemy?",
  "30308": "What child can that be?",
  "30309": "We are to meet as usual?",
  "30310": "Why can I not, on the contrary, say ill enough of her to prevent your going to her?",
  "30311": "But there's good art in me?",
  "30312": "Where is the commander in chief?",
  "30313": "And how do you like it?",
  "30314": "And higher still?",
  "30315": "What does that matter to me?",
  "30316": "Shall I tell you how it will be?",
  "30317": "And who are the really clever men, after all?",
  "30318": "For what other reason can you have laid your plans to talk in this way to such a woman as I am?",
  "30319": "It may come to that, that we must leave this place, but till that time comes, why should your young days be clouded?",
  "30320": "You won't do it again, eh?",
  "30321": "Why then does their rump look toward heaven?",
  "30322": "Has he not all the tricks of a demon at his command?",
  "30323": "What intonation of voice?",
  "30324": "You are coming to sup with me, are you not?",
  "30325": "Making ready for a move?",
  "30326": "But you guess it now, do you not?",
  "30327": "What was it he saw that made his heart stand still?",
  "30328": "Wasn't it all for your good, viper?",
  "30329": "Alas, what would become of me who can only atone for evil by doing good?",
  "30330": "Is the case so desperate?",

  "30336": "Who are you, dear?",
  "30337": "Waste?",
  "30338": "Then what would you like to do until your uncle comes back?",
  "30339": "If you can't see it yourself, why try to debar me?",
  "30340": "Bless the girl, what are you shivering about?",
  "30341": "Said he, and stamped with his foot, am I to be questioned thus by such a one as you?",
  "30342": "Then where is he?",
  "30343": "Were you obliged to have medical attendance?",
  "30344": "Has any horse got loose?",
  "30345": "And after him have you had no love?",
  "30346": "Where have you had your information?",
  "30347": "What is your meaning?",
  "30348": "With YOU?",
  "30349": "Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?",
  "30350": "What is a man the worse for dying?",
  "30351": "What constitutional maxim is there which applies to the former and not to the latter?",
  "30352": "Shall I arrange?",
  "30353": "Deer?",
  "30354": "Orders?",
  "30355": "Well and did you think they resembled feathered arrows when they were flying?",
  "30356": "He may have reported to you what he pleased, but could not I do the same by him?",
  "30357": "Why doesn't he get something to do?",
  "30358": "Why couldn't he have made up his mind last night?",
  "30359": "Who doubts that?",
  "30360": "Why, to accuse the man, do you address the woman?",
  "30361": "Have I any time to spare?",
  "30362": "Well, what does she want now?",
  "30363": "Haven't you got anything worse than this?",
  "30364": "But do you know why I am saying all this?",
  "30365": "Do you not come in the king's name?",
  "30366": "Shall we dress it here, as usual?",
  "30367": "Why should I fright ye?",
  "30368": "Between whom?",
  "30369": "Will you be my ally, my lady?",
  "30370": "Now then, where's your chief's quarters?",
  "30371": "Is that an aphorism or a cliche?",
  "30372": "What meaneth this restless wagging of her slouchy chaps?",
  "30373": "It gives a lonely man a sort of hankering, doesn't it?",
  "30374": "Ain't you afraid of it, sir?",
  "30375": "And anything else?",
  "30376": "You really won't meet the rest of them?",
  "30377": "How do I know it?",
  "30378": "But what's to be done?",
  "30379": "What is a trousseau?",
  "30380": "Where's the burnisher?",
  "30381": "The ruler may impose the laws and institutions which we have been describing, and the citizens may possibly be willing to obey them?",
  "30382": "You did not send to me?",
  "30383": "Monsieur, can you expose me to the cruel trial of never seeing you again?",
  "30384": "The kind that wear skins?",
  "30385": "Who shall say what he did think?",

  "30388": "Would it not be better if the end did come, the very end?",
  "30389": "No, never?",
  "30390": "Has the whelp been playing that game long?",
  "30391": "Is there no mission in thy native land, O planeticose and exallotriote spirit?",
  "30392": "Would we make any office hereditary that required wisdom and abilities to fill it?",
  "30393": "And what has he said to that?",
  "30394": "And your friend still longs to be made a baron?",
  "30395": "Would you tell me, please?",

  "30397": "But would the end really be his own convenience?",
  "30398": "What is the real value of this system of metaphysics, purified by criticism, and thereby reduced to a permanent condition?",
  "30399": "I suppose I'd better not come back with him?",
  "30400": "Does a flower appeal to him?",
  "30401": "Yes, she's as good as they make 'em, and she's all the female I possess and spoiled in consequence, aren't you, old girl?",
  "30402": "What do you know?",
  "30403": "What then could I against the will of heaven?",
  "30404": "Will you allow me to whisper half a syllable, sir?",
  "30405": "Whence arises this fault?",
  "30406": "Would you like a cup of tea?",
  "30407": "In this state of the case, my friends, why is the country agitated?",
  "30408": "You are rich, then, I suppose?",
  "30409": "But how about the tennis?",
  "30410": "Did he mean that literally?",
  "30411": "But tell me, has your father had you entered on the registers of his phratria?",
  "30412": "Hadn't you better say two fifty?",
  "30413": "If the infected were removed, why not mention it?",
  "30414": "Which is it to be?",
  "30415": "Then he will no more have true opinion than he will have knowledge about the goodness or badness of his imitations?",
  "30416": "You have seen him?",
  "30417": "What men are safe if this is done?",
  "30418": "Does she think so?",
  "30419": "Why don't you ask him?",
  "30420": "Does it hurt to be invis'ble?",
  "30421": "You don't think I do it because I like it, do you?",
  "30422": "Is that correct?",
  "30423": "Girl number twenty, isn't this a prosperous nation, and a'n't you in a thriving state?",
  "30424": "Had you, then, that sum?",
  "30425": "Our lease expires when?",
  "30426": "Who are you who speaks out of the darkness?",
  "30427": "Are they to have the fame of such as they go through, and we the labour?",
  "30428": "Yes, yes, it should be a pleasure, the greatest of all, perhaps, for is not killing the next thing to creating?",
  "30429": "Should you also like to be maid of honor?",
  "30430": "What discovery?",
  "30431": "What shall we do with our sleds?",
  "30432": "What big house is that just ahead, please?",
  "30433": "What will you do with yourself for the time?",
  "30434": "You have kissed the queen's hand?",
  "30435": "But when will that come to pass?",
  "30436": "Will you promise?",
  "30437": "Why do you give me this shame?",
  "30438": "Its name?",
  "30439": "I say, why have you been so rotten since I came back?",
  "30440": "On what subject shall I converse with her?",
  "30441": "Have you taken any precautions?",
  "30442": "You have unmasked this false prince also?",
  "30443": "Were you walking in your sleep?",
  "30444": "Won't you love me?",
  "30445": "Are you aware, sir, that we have gone to enormous expense to resist this iniquitous attempt of yours?",
  "30446": "Will you hold the horse while I stick them on?",
  "30447": "Well, then, I must go?",
  "30448": "Is it the solitary cell you want?",
  "30449": "An't you cold?",
  "30450": "Have you anything to say?",
  "30451": "You were not surprised, I dare say?",
  "30452": "How can I help laws?",
  "30453": "You could not tell vs if his sonne were there?",
  "30454": "Do you mean to say you don't hear anything?",
  "30455": "Who is his master?",
  "30456": "No garters?",
  "30457": "What is it that you think I shall do?",
  "30458": "What, you here too, prince?",
  "30459": "What in the world was this hall used for?",
  "30460": "Who would believe him?",
  "30461": "Offended me, boy?",
  "30462": "You know how to support losses?",
  "30463": "What were they doing now?",
  "30464": "I guess you'll mind your parts o' speech, and study the ACCIDENCE agin afore you let your clapper run arter that fashion, won't you?",
  "30465": "Then we should be able to ascertain if the BRITANNIA had left any traces of her shipwreck there?",
  "30466": "What are you going to flog that man for, sir?",
  "30467": "What is he going to do?",
  "30468": "Must we always kill the people?",
  "30469": "Now what was the colonel to do?",
  "30470": "May I ask what is the cause of this unseemly noise?",
  "30471": "If it should break forth into a storm, who can insure us that in its progress a part of its fury would not be spent upon us?",
  "30472": "I'm going to be good, but can't you be good running round just as well as sitting still?",
  "30473": "How can we prevent that?",
  "30474": "Can't we go overside a piece?",
  "30475": "Might I come some other day?",
  "30476": "Go for a soldier, do you mean?",
  "30477": "But what did the mere reckoning of years matter when he felt as young in heart as he had been twenty years ago?",
  "30478": "How could a garden be shut up?",
  "30479": "Your wife or your daughter?",
  "30480": "So that you could see he knew what was between the two wretches?",
  "30481": "But who is there in the world that can boast of having fathomed or understood the wavering mind and unstable nature of a woman?",
  "30482": "Did you ever behold streets so insufferably narrow, or houses so miraculously tall?",
  "30483": "How can they know?",
  "30484": "Is it to make me a captain?",
  "30485": "What IS the matter with it?",
  "30486": "Would that surprise you?",
  "30487": "But would he come?",
  "30488": "How do you know I was praying, sir?",
  "30489": "Who looks after the sick here?",
  "30490": "Can'tyou walk yet?",
  "30491": "Who can make him out?",
  "30492": "To whom do I address it?",
  "30493": "But where was mine?",
  "30494": "Am I, indeed, so happy?",
  "30495": "Hemlock, do you mean?",
  "30496": "How could you possibly know that?",
  "30497": "Why so insensible to my uncle's interests?",
  "30498": "And the possibility has been acknowledged?",
  "30499": "Your ruin?",
  "30500": "Do you mean in point of reward?",
  "30501": "But how long have you been here that you are ignorant of all this?",
  "30502": "Haven't you put a drop of poison in that remark now, eh?",
  "30503": "Would there ever come to him a time of freedom?",
  "30504": "Will you bear, therefore, will you bear to see your sanctuary trampled on?",
  "30505": "Even if the squire should afterwards hear of his having been there, what would it matter?",
  "30506": "She said I was prudent and virtuous?",
  "30507": "How are you to get away from here?",
  "30508": "You are confident that the thief came in a cab?",
  "30509": "That's what it always comes to, doesn't it?",
  "30510": "What could he want?",
  "30511": "That was something in this way, warn't it?",
  "30512": "Why not have kept hold of it with both hands, with both knees, when it was about to flee from her?",
  "30513": "But to what does all this lead?",
  "30514": "Hasn't she always you?",
  "30515": "How do the bass chords run?",
  "30516": "Shall I send the servant to direct you?",
  "30517": "How much is the whole?",
  "30518": "And who instructed you, eh?",
  "30519": "Do you know anything of his history?",
  "30520": "Was she ever as pretty as my mother is now?",
  "30521": "But the puzzle is, who are the teachers?",
  "30522": "How could you be cruel to me?",
  "30523": "But well carried out, eh?",
  "30524": "How did you fare?",
  "30525": "Who does it come from?",
  "30526": "What happened within her?",
  "30527": "Whom had he to consult but himself now?",
  "30528": "What differences from terrestrial conditions will ensue?",
  "30529": "Isn't there a lot of hope in it?",
  "30530": "What stable?",
  "30531": "Do I look ugly?",
  "30532": "To relieve thy breast?",
  "30533": "Can you lift me into that tree and put a rifle in my hands?",
  "30534": "Shall I tell you what you were thinking to yourself just then?",
  "30535": "But what can I have to relate to you?",
  "30536": "Why is that woman always out of the way when she is most wanted?",
  "30537": "I hope you don't mind?",
  "30538": "What right had they to make me suffer like that?",
  "30539": "How long do you suppose this sea to be?",
  "30540": "Do you desire it as ardently as you say?",
  "30541": "If nature suddenly should give that beast a tail, would he not be prouder of it than all the other foxes in the wood?",
  "30542": "Watch and listen, won't you, so that you can give me your impression after the first act?",
  "30543": "Who could have said so the evening before?",
  "30544": "Very good?",
  "30545": "Are you likely to be more humane to me than others were yesterday?",
  "30546": "Was it my imagination that there was an undertone of fear rather than of hope in the question?",
  "30547": "What could have caused it?",
  "30548": "Is he a scholar, or a soldier?",
  "30549": "And to confer upon me the favour of your distinguished recommendation?",
  "30550": "How can he keep him?",
  "30551": "Surely you have felt that it is so?",
  "30552": "Could there be a development of knowledge in the absence of curiosity?",
  "30553": "Do the old fellows bother you?",
  "30554": "If what?",
  "30555": "And how have you been getting on?",
  "30556": "But you, sir?",
  "30557": "Did you see?",
  "30558": "Who is your favorite author?",
  "30559": "You think this old monkey in here knows what you say?",
  "30560": "What would you gain by it?",
  "30561": "You've been picking the flowers, hey?",
  "30562": "But are you so sure, so very sure of her?",
  "30563": "If I get your grandpa to apologize for the shaking, will you give up running away?",
  "30564": "Who's here?",
  "30565": "Don't you think that this has lasted long enough?",
  "30566": "Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring?",
  "30567": "And it is asked by what authority this bold and radical innovation was undertaken?",
  "30568": "I asked him upon this if he ever disputed with his wife?",
  "30569": "Sirrah, who gave you a commission to lie in my lordship?",
  "30570": "How can I tell?",
  "30571": "How could I let him?",
  "30572": "But do you suppose I carry five hundred francs about with me?",
  "30573": "What hand and brain went ever pair'd?",
  "30574": "Why did you write me such a horrid letter, you naughty boy?",
  "30575": "Or can I ever see one?",
  "30576": "Quite?",
  "30577": "What is she vexed with him about?",
  "30578": "To do that, my joy?",
  "30579": "And later?",
  "30580": "Will you malign your native realms and reduce them to a level with the country upstairs?",
  "30581": "But what language is it?",
  "30582": "Wouldn't YOU?",
  "30583": "Lucy dear, do you know why I tell you all this?",
  "30584": "How did they come to love each other?",
  "30585": "But what are you going to do to repay us for the past?",
  "30586": "Are you in a position to tax the nation to the extent of four hundred million dollars?",
  "30587": "Got any views on the subject?",
  "30588": "Of the duke?",
  "30589": "What means all this?",
  "30590": "Will you stay here if the enemy occupies the place?",
  "30591": "For how shall I be able, said he, to rule over others, that have not full power and command of myself?",
  "30592": "Go?",
  "30593": "Have I deserved to be called an elderly person?",
  "30594": "Is it because we are calculated to walk?",
  "30595": "Why ask about the next but one?",
  "30596": "Can we have the butler in for a moment?",
  "30597": "Wasn't it good of him?",
  "30598": "What prodigies be these?",
  "30599": "Who suffers by his ill whims?",
  "30600": "Do you hear the news?",
  "30601": "Is there any one who understands human and political virtue?",
  "30602": "Won't you go with me?",
  "30603": "What did she see there?",
  "30604": "The postilion?",
  "30605": "What ancient nation, as the same author asks, can be named that was originally monogamous?",
  "30606": "What can I do to do myself justice upon her?",
  "30607": "Your letter is like you, and what could I say of it that would be higher praise than that?",
  "30608": "You would not be cruel to me?",
  "30609": "Is everything here purple?",
  "30610": "Do you think we did well in using the adder's fat?",
  "30611": "When to be made payable?",
  "30612": "Is she married, my dear?",
  "30613": "Anyone about?",
  "30614": "Oriental?",
  "30615": "Are we going to see the court?",
  "30616": "So why should he have made such a sacrifice?",
  "30617": "Hrut asked him what news?",
  "30618": "What accursed philosophy stands in your way?",
  "30619": "And have you been up there?",
  "30620": "But why do you give them me?",
  "30621": "What was his own inward definitive response to the unbribable interrogatory of fatality?",
  "30622": "Is not the land more faithful?",
  "30623": "I wonder if it is mine?",
  "30624": "If you demand WHY?",
  "30625": "Allow me to ask you, prince, since you cherish those intentions, how you consider that you will provide for my happiness?",
  "30626": "Who among them can do it so well?",
  "30627": "And upon what will the tax be levied?",
  "30628": "Ursula, aren't you FEARFULLY tired?",
  "30629": "Can't you see that he humbugs you just as much as ever he pleases?",
  "30630": "What would the gain be to me if I were healed and you not?",
  "30631": "The moonlight than the fog of frost?",
  "30632": "Where is he hiding?",
  "30633": "Why did not you say so then?",
  "30634": "What do you mean, sir?",
  "30635": "Would you like me to help you tonight?",
  "30636": "Why how you talk?",
  "30637": "Was there any lady of the house?",
  "30638": "For from what impression coued this idea be derived?",
  "30639": "Where did you get that onion?",
  "30640": "And shall we arrive there?",
  "30641": "Don't you see that he doesn't want to be followed?",
  "30642": "Is it about my husband?",
  "30643": "Does anybody bring up other people's children?",
  "30644": "What's the use of our wasting another year?",
  "30645": "Stolen diamonds?",
  "30646": "Mary, what do you think is going to happen?",
  "30647": "Well, what have you to say to me?",
  "30648": "Have you a cabriolet that you can let me have?",
  "30649": "What is it to you what he signs?",
  "30650": "She didn't tell you so?",

  "30658": "How many women in these days would think of doing that?",
  "30659": "How is your hand?",
  "30660": "What ails you?",
  "30661": "Is it not strange that people can laugh, amuse themselves, be joyful under that eternal certainty of death?",
  "30662": "Yours or mine?",
  "30663": "Well, daughter, say, what is thy suit with us?",
  "30664": "What was the reason of this disappointment?",

  "30676": "Art tha' sure?",
  "30677": "What, YOU fly?",
  "30678": "How could he be expected to remember her?",
  "30679": "Need we think of that since we are to save the king?",
  "30680": "Is that what you expected to get from me?",
  "30681": "And what became of the bust?",
  "30682": "What have I done?",
  "30683": "Has the picture been engraved, miss?",
  "30684": "Shall we not be glad and rejoice in the happiness of our children?",

  "30692": "And when did you find time to do them?",
  "30693": "I don't mean in the village only, but up town?",
  "30694": "Perhaps he has dribbled away too?",
  "30695": "Did it bite, hey?",
  "30696": "Are you going away immediately?",
  "30697": "Yes, sir?",
  "30698": "What did you say, then?",
  "30699": "What whale?",
  "30700": "What have you to gain by a strike?",

  "31512": "Falling?",
  "31513": "Whatten penance will ye dree for that?",
  "31514": "Was he going to rebuild?",
  "31515": "Do you mean he will not be contented with violet stockings, and that he wants a red hat?",
  "31516": "What could he be dreaming of?",
  "31517": "And you won't tell me what you want it for?",
  "31518": "Have you heard if he was much hurt?",
  "31519": "And how so?",
  "31520": "What do I make of it?",
  "31521": "All that tempest, all that cloud, that war, then that peace?",
  "31522": "But what motive had they in advising, from which so great a disaster was the result?",
  "31523": "What is the news?",
  "31524": "Well, then, what does the rest of 'em do?",
  "31525": "How else do you think I could educate them at all?",
  "31526": "How far is it now to the inn?",
  "31527": "Why do you feel so bad about that affair of this morning?",
  "31528": "Do you know the relief that my disappearance will be?",
  "31529": "Do you think so now?",
  "31530": "Or will he be carried away by the stream?",
  "31531": "Have you forgotten that when you were in trouble I did everything for you?",
  "31532": "But what is it, then, that I am accused of?",
  "31533": "Odd, wasn't it?",
  "31534": "Have you ever really loved anybody?",
  "31535": "Or that night, when I frowned at him?",
  "31536": "With the prince still?",
  "31537": "And a young lover come and carried off the bride, eh?",
  "31538": "Who hindered his coming to the house?",
  "31539": "Do you recognize that, miss?",
  "31540": "Had not all the other places refused her because she did not know something or other?",
  "31541": "What could be the trouble?",
  "31542": "Sparsit, ma'am?",
  "31543": "Han't they telled ye that he'll help ye, and ye can go to heaven, and have rest, at last?",
  "31544": "But isn't he ugly?",
  "31545": "Oh, is that it?",
  "31546": "Can't he speak?",
  "31547": "Well, then, how is it that your eminence complained just now of want of information?",
  "31548": "Here, on the verandah?",
  "31549": "And how could this be properly explained to the young lady in gentle terms?",
  "31550": "Do you think it's because I'm really bad and unregenerate?",
  "31551": "Are you not?",
  "31552": "Then how about our position?",
  "31553": "And will he not?",

  "31561": "And as to her face, could it inspire nothing but passion?",
  "31562": "What was it then, and how had it affected his fate?",
  "31563": "Manager to a diamond merchant, or some such thing, is he not?",
  "31564": "And he does forgive?",
  "31565": "When all that failed, he boldly accosted him, and asked him, whether he did not remember him?",
  "31566": "Or, whither he should go?",
  "31567": "But we shall see you at the musicale this afternoon, shall we not?",
  "31568": "Should possibilities be worse to bear than certainties?",
  "31569": "Has the post come in?",

  "31578": "You can stay some time?",
  "31579": "What had occurred since, calculated to change his and my relative positions?",
  "31580": "The other side of WHAT?",
  "31581": "And you swim?",
  "31582": "Was he commencing to suspect?",
  "31583": "And in like manner does the touch adequately perceive the qualities of thickness or thinness, or softness or hardness?",
  "31584": "When you came in at the gate and asked the watchman the way here, had you any one with you?",
  "31585": "Won't you speak to me?",
  "31586": "Where did your instructions come from?",
  "31587": "Why, then, monseigneur does not know?",
  "31588": "But, gentlemen, why are you getting angry again?",
  "31589": "And now it is you who have brought them together again?",
  "31590": "Was there not a spirit in him which, silent as it was, burned on him like the fires of perdition?",
  "31591": "Hurt you?",
  "31592": "What visions, they asked, could one but read them, must lie behind the quiet, dreaming eyes of that inscrutable face?",
  "31593": "What resources could they expect to find upon that scene of desolation?",
  "31594": "May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?",
  "31595": "Are you reconciled?",
  "31596": "Are you nothing?",
  "31597": "But what could have frightened the creatures so, and driven them from their haunts, when they ought to have been quietly sleeping?",
  "31598": "Or would you include the mixed?",
  "31599": "Was it a screw or thrust?",
  "31600": "Ah, then, is THAT what you've stayed over for?",
  "31601": "Do you know that he's the honestest and faithfullest fellow that ever lived, and that he has an irreproachable good name?",
  "31602": "What do you think of it, now?",
  "31603": "Why not?",
  "31604": "Always busy at what?",
  "31605": "How is it possible for him to be attained to?",
  "31606": "Fine, isn't it?",
  "31607": "Is it finished?",
  "31608": "What do you mean?",
  "31609": "He was to be another father to him, and they were all to live together in a garden of roses, weren't they?",
  "31610": "Do you hesitate?",
  "31611": "Is there any one in the lobby?",
  "31612": "I like the baron, but what better gifts can marriage bestow, than I already possess?",
  "31613": "Is not that saying illustrated by this?",
  "31614": "What's he?",
  "31615": "Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?",
  "31616": "Silver?",
  "31617": "Are we going to continue this pace all night?",
  "31618": "Can I be so lucky as to find what everybody is seeking for?",
  "31619": "Face?",
  "31620": "What else have you done?",
  "31621": "Haven't you given her any warning of your arrival?",
  "31622": "It stung you up a bit when I spoke of your game leg, young fellow?",
  "31623": "Sire, will you allow me to speak frankly as befits a loyal soldier?",
  "31624": "Then why speak to me about it?",
  "31625": "What the devil do I do?",
  "31626": "Who would ever know?",
  "31627": "Well, but they'll see how small you are afterwards, won't they?",
  "31628": "Was I very gleeful, settled, content, during the hours I passed in yonder bare, humble schoolroom this morning and afternoon?",
  "31629": "Who will shrive the poor wretch, if you have come away from him?",
  "31630": "Why should I do so?",
  "31631": "Is there no mistake?",
  "31632": "Must he not have the qualities of a sage?",
  "31633": "You don't want to?",
  "31634": "Why is the sycophant thus added to the hypocrite, and the man who pretends to govern, sunk into the humble and submissive memorialist?",
  "31635": "Well, have we attained our end there also?",
  "31636": "From the dry rock who bade the waters flow?",
  "31637": "Do you observe that we were not far wrong in our guess that temperance was a sort of harmony?",
  "31638": "Whatever her sins, they were not sins of intention, but of inadvertence, and why should she have been punished so persistently?",
  "31639": "What was the bargain?",
  "31640": "And his dog also?",
  "31641": "Must I call you a liar as well as a thief?",
  "31642": "Why did you bring me here?",
  "31643": "If he could not speak, how was she to do so?",
  "31644": "And he will accomplish the trip?",
  "31645": "Is he mad?",
  "31646": "What is she there for?",
  "31647": "YOU insulted ME?",
  "31648": "Will you come along home wi' me, and see my wife?",
  "31649": "And now, matey, did that doctor say how long I was to lie here in this old berth?",
  "31650": "My companion?",
  "31651": "For how can one?",
  "31652": "Game for a morning drive?",
  "31653": "You know where you left the team?",
  "31654": "How much have you lost?",
  "31655": "The boy's name?",
  "31656": "Why do you want to start on that again?",
  "31657": "But have we not all been misled about our heroes and changed our opinions a hundred times?",
  "31658": "And you yourself, what do you think about it?",
  "31659": "Why do you say I do not regard it?",
  "31660": "Must we, then, give up to despair?",
  "31661": "But where the devil are you?",
  "31662": "Living?",
  "31663": "Do you know what you have said?",
  "31664": "But where the devil were you gladding last night, my young master?",
  "31665": "Well, and what has she been doing?",
  "31666": "You think I can't shoot me a fox?",
  "31667": "Shall we not spend our immortal life together?",
  "31668": "Would this political deterrence prove acceptable to allies and to our own public?",
  "31669": "Should not all they be called mercenary who are always seeking consolations?",
  "31670": "Where is it, then?",
  "31671": "Do you really mean that?",
  "31672": "How could you get across?",
  "31673": "Can I take her into the spare room to lay off her hat when she comes?",
  "31674": "I did not know his wife, but she was a woman, wasn't she?",
  "31675": "In case of doubt, shall it award the property to the first occupant?",
  "31676": "And the sago?",
  "31677": "You have not wanted for anything, vicomte, in my absence, have you?",
  "31678": "Who knows the will of heaven?",
  "31679": "What's that?",
  "31680": "Who's the object of your meditation, sir?",
  "31681": "Would you not say that he is entirely concerned with the soul and not with the body?",
  "31682": "Have we not?",
  "31683": "Who knows whether a sort of infernal glow would not have lingered behind it on the brow of that angel?",
  "31684": "What does she think herself about him?",
  "31685": "Do you hate me so much as all that?",
  "31686": "Is not this to be rich?",
  "31687": "Should you like to retire at once?",
  "31688": "Will you ever go back?",
  "31689": "Why conceal your real feelings?",
  "31690": "In a hospital?",

  "31700": "And when shall we have the honor of seeing you again, your excellency?",
  "31701": "Are you interested in the sugar question?",
  "31702": "And they will go in three days now?",
  "31703": "But what good could he have done if he had?",

  "31720": "Who was there present?",
  "31721": "What interest, I say, what interest do you ask?",
  "31722": "Not sick, are you?",
  "31723": "But what if I were mistaken?",
  "31724": "Then do you yourself know?",

  "31732": "What had fate in store for these daring adventurers?",
  "31733": "Who do these three cavaliers appear to you to be?",
  "31734": "Or be a clerk or lawyer?",
  "31735": "How did you know?",
  "31736": "Don't you want any more of it?",
  "31737": "And how could I do that, unless so be I was there myself?",
  "31738": "Are you still intimate with her?",
  "31739": "I might, mightn't I?",
  "31740": "Or I my brains?",
  "31741": "Has anyone assaulted you?",
  "31742": "Whose?",
  "31743": "Is it in vain our conquering arms subdue?",
  "31744": "Do you suppose I ain't the best judge of what's proper and what's improper?",
  "31745": "That idea is your own, and yours solely?",

  "31747": "Where are you going now?",
  "31748": "You will not say it?",
  "31749": "What are we going to do?",
  "31750": "How about these papers?",
  "31751": "Will nobody say what is the matter?",
  "31752": "But why should I repine?",
  "31753": "Won't truth serve your turns?",
  "31754": "It IS frightening to be very ill, isn't it?",
  "31755": "I must be trembling, does it not show in my writing?",
  "31756": "How had it come to pass that matters which with others are so private, should with her have become the public property of so large a circle?",
  "31757": "Where is the man who can say the fault, in part, has not been his?",
  "31758": "You would allow, I said, that there is in nature an upper and lower and middle region?",
  "31759": "When should we see those five again, who had just disappeared from view on the boundless plain, and in what conditions?",
  "31760": "Well, and what do you think?",
  "31761": "Have we lost the power of rendering you happy?",
  "31762": "Why not, sire?",
  "31763": "Are you sure that you do not falter or fear?",
  "31764": "And what can we do there?",
  "31765": "Want money?",
  "31766": "You're not going to be silly about it, are you?",
  "31767": "And have you ever seen her by any chance?",
  "31768": "Haven't you told him, sir?",
  "31769": "You have heard nothing to the contrary, have you?",
  "31770": "Did you find him, gossip?",
  "31771": "Then you don't think I was foolish?",
  "31772": "Is it all over?",
  "31773": "What's that, sir?",
  "31774": "That you fled from your husband?",
  "31775": "Remember where he said the book was?",
  "31776": "Whence does he come?",
  "31777": "And now, when shall we meet again?",

  "31798": "Why scare people?",
  "31799": "Where am I to let you know to?",
  "31800": "After all, why wasn't he there?",
  "31801": "Any fault there?",
  "31802": "Where did you get that donkey head?",
  "31803": "Was anybody here just now?",

  "31807": "Of her character?",
  "31808": "Like my father?",
  "31809": "Yes, and why did you go in?",
  "31810": "In which world?",
  "31811": "You have arms, I suppose?",
  "31812": "Where are you bound for?",
  "31813": "And of what kind of trees?",
  "31814": "Going to college, I suppose?",

  "31819": "Johnson?",
  "31820": "What good is it then for the ball to be thrown up, or harm for it to come down, or even to have fallen?",
  "31821": "But would it be so?",
  "31822": "Do you play much?",

  "31829": "Is he in the house now?",
  "31830": "Have you nothing to add?",
  "31831": "Does the straw bother you, mate?",
  "31832": "My footprint, I presume?",
  "31833": "Would you like it again?",
  "31834": "Where is he going?",
  "31835": "And what did you do in the matter, bishop?",
  "31836": "Give me what you took from me, will you?",
  "31837": "Didn't you?",
  "31838": "Are you going to marry him?",
  "31839": "But she's got her faults, you mean to say?",

  "31841": "Who might have done that, I wonder?",
  "31842": "How long do you remain here, prince?",
  "31843": "Then you don't attribute the crime to the natives?",
  "31844": "But did you never win?",

  "33092": "Ah, dear sister, how can I answer this question?",
  "33093": "Why will you think so?",
  "33094": "What could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as it dropped on her work?",
  "33095": "Do you mean me, sir?",
  "33096": "Did he not pretend to go back to his tribe, who had treated him ill, and driven him from their wigwams like a dog?",
  "33097": "But how can we find the way in this fog?",
  "33098": "Had he noticed that the days had been only six hours long, and that the weight of the atmosphere was so much diminished?",
  "33099": "What was the man doing when you saw him?",
  "33100": "What does all this knowing mean to me?",
  "33101": "Might not that person by patient waiting be covering silent preparation, and proving his fitness for the glorious task before him?",
  "33102": "But what if it's worse than this?",
  "33103": "Not HE?",
  "33104": "Do I try and catch them?",
  "33105": "Still inquisitive?",
  "33106": "Is it my fault if fortune, which has frowned on you, has been kind to me?",
  "33107": "You haf not got something to drink, hey?",
  "33108": "Yes, dear?",
  "33109": "Art shod with lead?",
  "33110": "Wherein have I hurt you?",
  "33111": "He is in, is there another room whence she can hear him?",
  "33112": "Will our help come from you?",
  "33113": "How should there be eighteen copies, all different from the original, and from one another, in minor matters?",
  "33114": "In the meantime, who can foretell what would be the sufferings and privations of the people during its existence?",
  "33115": "Am I cleared?",
  "33116": "What is it, grandmother?",
  "33117": "If we could get a drink?",
  "33118": "Is it not the duty of the nations to combine and to relieve suffering humanity?",
  "33119": "Then that is not the knowledge which we are seeking to discover?",
  "33120": "You met a monk, did you not?",
  "33121": "Can I not read your heart?",
  "33122": "You don't KNOW?",
  "33123": "What, it seems I do not drink but by an attorney?",
  "33124": "What was the cause of this flaw?",
  "33125": "Shall I give her?",
  "33126": "Was it right to be frightened already?",
  "33127": "Why can't they do as I have done, ma'am?",
  "33128": "At what hour would you wish the ceremony performed?",
  "33129": "Do you mean a compliment?",
  "33130": "Do you not know that there is a spirit within you different from flesh?",
  "33131": "In this painful moment can the best of fathers wish to destroy my domestic happiness, the only kind which now remains to me?",
  "33132": "What struggle was going on within him?",
  "33133": "So that he still expects his money?",
  "33134": "Why don't you open the door for papa?",
  "33135": "What will become of us if she dies, as I always fear when her face is like that?",
  "33136": "And if not, is he a devil?",
  "33137": "You your command, and I my title?",
  "33138": "Why has she not written to me, then?",
  "33139": "By this train?",
  "33140": "Are they good to eat?",
  "33141": "Will we trample again upon that torn and mangled corpse?",
  "33142": "And who can wonder if it be so, mother?",
  "33143": "Are you comfortable now, sir?",
  "33144": "Swear it was not true?",
  "33145": "What good was moral support in providing a million and a half?",
  "33146": "But can you restore him back to life?",
  "33147": "You won't consider me in your debt?",
  "33148": "I hope you're well?",
  "33149": "Did he designedly conceal some incident of his captivity?",
  "33150": "You remember that young fellow mother wanted me to have?",
  "33151": "So there are fashions, nowadays, in illness, are there?",
  "33152": "Then, sir, you are a favourite, I find, among the ladies?",
  "33153": "Do he rave about his mother just the same, poor fellow?",
  "33154": "Where is it?",
  "33155": "Yours then are rather here?",
  "33156": "Are you in a position to quit the post of superintendent at this moment?",
  "33157": "Do you observe anything remarkable about that?",
  "33158": "How was this to be done?",
  "33159": "Have you never heard talk of a certain secret?",
  "33160": "Did he come here voluntarily?",
  "33161": "Wouldn't you?",
  "33162": "What do you really think of her?",
  "33163": "When did he give it you?",
  "33164": "Unintentionally?",
  "33165": "Harry?",
  "33166": "Am I to come home?",
  "33167": "And the result of the examination?",
  "33168": "His ELDER brother?",
  "33169": "Perhaps he was expected to utter certain words?",
  "33170": "Supposing he is loyal, can any of his requests be granted, and if any, which of them?",
  "33171": "Are you sure you are more reasonable?",
  "33172": "Shall I go in first?",
  "33173": "What will you warm yourself with this winter?",
  "33174": "How is it they come to you?",
  "33175": "What have you got there?",
  "33176": "Have you your carriage?",
  "33177": "Do you think that you will catch anything?",
  "33178": "What is she lying down for?",
  "33179": "Who said she knew him?",
  "33180": "How do you find yourself this morning, sir?",
  "33181": "And what would you call this?",
  "33182": "How think you of that?",
  "33183": "Does she?",
  "33184": "What is that water?",
  "33185": "Going on?",
  "33186": "What palace may it deck?",
  "33187": "Reversed?",
  "33188": "Are you going to sit down, or are you not?",
  "33189": "Oh, master, what are you saying?",
  "33190": "Don't you remember that THAT, originally, was what we were to get her for?",
  "33191": "Were you ever there?",
  "33192": "Ain't you going to do anything, sir?",
  "33193": "Do you see what a villain he is?",
  "33194": "Don't you think a good deal is done when you come out and talk to me this way?",
  "33195": "And yet, when I was at my father's, did not the men give up their gayest balls and parties in order to pass the evening with me?",
  "33196": "But I want to know why the word 'moor' should have been written?",
  "33197": "We sent you wine?",
  "33198": "When did you get the letter?",
  "33199": "What is indispensable to you?",
  "33200": "Or perhaps you are too tired?",
  "33201": "What have I said?",
  "33202": "But how could you be sure I would know it?",
  "33203": "Tell me, I entreat of you, who and what you are?",
  "33204": "Had he not seduced his sisters, one after the other?",
  "33205": "Might I speak to you with regard to that matter of his grace, sir?",
  "33206": "You mean to say our old raft warn't smashed all to flinders?",
  "33207": "Must I close this?",
  "33208": "The world is surely not worth living in now, is it?",
  "33209": "And was this the man?",
  "33210": "What's the time?",
  "33211": "What's queer?",
  "33212": "But was he a lawyer after all?",
  "33213": "What house will they take?",
  "33214": "Was it well?",
  "33215": "Could it be done?",
  "33216": "Why should I stand in a comrade's way?",
  "33217": "What else should I stay on for?",
  "33218": "What beings surround me?",
  "33219": "What judgment?",
  "33220": "D'Epinay?",
  "33221": "Well, hain't he got a father?",
  "33222": "Are you certain of what you say, monsieur?",
  "33223": "And the reason is that each part of him is doing its own business, whether in ruling or being ruled?",
  "33224": "You want it, I expect?",
  "33225": "Had he been fooled once more?",
  "33226": "Do you seriously believe that that machine has travelled into time?",
  "33227": "Natasha, have you considered what these secret reasons can be?",
  "33228": "What says our graver sister?",
  "33229": "Can I do anything?",
  "33230": "Ain't you seen the rag this week?",
  "33231": "What passage is that?",
  "33232": "But does she now dissolve the union?",
  "33233": "Any way out of that yard, now?",
  "33234": "Waw shouldn't I git a bit o me own back?",
  "33235": "Have those who have had their share in oligarchies been peculiarly wise and peculiarly devoted to the common good?",
  "33236": "What was there to be done in the village?",
  "33237": "What should I tell?",
  "33238": "Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad?",
  "33239": "To what purpose?",
  "33240": "And if it is labor that creates wealth and legitimates property, how explain the consumption of the idler?",
  "33241": "What did you mean by that?",
  "33242": "Well, what do YOU make of it?",
  "33243": "Are there any?",
  "33244": "And if I refuse to retract, you wish to fight, do you?",
  "33245": "Dora, what has happened to you?",
  "33246": "Where have you been sleeping all this week?",
  "33247": "But what do you gather from it?",
  "33248": "Well, ain't you going to save any of it?",
  "33249": "Then how could you know?",
  "33250": "Are you much hurt?",
  "33251": "Daunted?",
  "33252": "And why should you try to deceive me by telling a tale?",
  "33253": "Can I come, with my doll?",
  "33254": "Should not I be able to set it forth correctly before the judge, if occasion required?",
  "33255": "Are you sorry for hiring me, master?",
  "33256": "Yes my boy?",
  "33257": "Why this man saved and that man lost?",
  "33258": "Aren't they beautiful?",
  "33259": "How has my judgment wander'd?",
  "33260": "You know what I mean?",
  "33261": "What, sweetheart?",
  "33262": "What sort of a place is it?",
  "33263": "Well, I vow, that's what the sea folks call sailing UNDER BARE POLES, come true, aint it?",
  "33264": "Who took his hands out of mine?",
  "33265": "I insist upon your living, do you hear?",
  "33266": "Why on earth did you ask him to dine with us?",
  "33267": "A man's or a woman's?",
  "33268": "Was she sheering off?",
  "33269": "What say your old men?",
  "33270": "Monsieur d'Artagnan, will you do me a favor?",
  "33271": "Are not the quail, the pigeon and the partridge the natural prey of the hawk?",
  "33272": "From the country, I see, sir?",
  "33273": "Would prudence or gratitude allow the pontiffs to renounce their benefactor?",
  "33274": "Why must their ruffs be always crinkled like endive leaves, and not crimped with a crimping iron?",
  "33275": "To whom is it they should have recourse?",
  "33276": "But who is there that ever heard of such an instinct?",
  "33277": "Well, but what am I to do?",
  "33278": "Subdivide?",
  "33279": "What is the colour of the men?",
  "33280": "What's the pay?",
  "33281": "Because I sigh when thinking of some one I am leaving?",
  "33282": "Whom did you play with?",
  "33283": "Do they work worse?",
  "33284": "You're not worried about anything?",
  "33285": "Are you sure you know the way?",
  "33286": "Why not make him a doctor like his father?",
  "33287": "But what was that to her, or to any one but myself?",
  "33288": "A little fancy work?",
  "33289": "Where are you off to?",
  "33290": "Yes, but if we can't help them?",
  "33291": "What's set you a snivelling now?",
  "33292": "And who is to do the parish work?",
  "33293": "Are you well fed?",
  "33294": "Well, why don't they support us?",
  "33295": "How many years do you mean to live after I am gone?",
  "33296": "What could these people do?",
  "33297": "Do you think I would leave you?",
  "33298": "And what do you call all this?",
  "33299": "Is it anything bad?",
  "33300": "Is it of course?",
  "33301": "But now what?",
  "33302": "Where did the buffaloes kill him?",
  "33303": "Where is it?",
  "33304": "Would these two travellers make much difference to the horses, if we took them with us?",
  "33305": "Shall we not bear the trials of life a little longer in patience?",
  "33306": "How can they recognize you, if you act in such a manner that no one can recognize you?",
  "33307": "What is it you smell of?",
  "33308": "Forgotten, indeed?",
  "33309": "Were you at the performance last evening?",
  "33310": "How have you got on?",
  "33311": "Why had she allowed him to understand that he was master of her heart?",
  "33312": "Paying the money, I suppose?",
  "33313": "What then should I say, if I dared complain, I who am deprived of all who are dear to me?",
  "33314": "May one venture to ask you, monsieur, on what you have reflected?",
  "33315": "Are you, then, a coward?",
  "33316": "Would it not be safer and more certain if I should ask him his name and tell him yours?",
  "33317": "Why, how did he come here, mother?",
  "33318": "You'll get down, brother, won't you, and take something?",
  "33319": "Why do you say that, when you are going to this terrible war, and he is so old?",
  "33320": "Under what law, and for what offence?",
  "33321": "Easily?",
  "33322": "Why did he not take her in his arms and swear that he would never leave her?",
  "33323": "DID you hear that?",
  "33324": "Is the committee willing to hear this witness?",
  "33325": "Would you care for it?",
  "33326": "Who will be waiting for me beyond the ditch?",
  "33327": "May I?",
  "33328": "What is the stone called?",
  "33329": "Now, sir, tell me who and what that woman was?",
  "33330": "Are you one?",
  "33331": "Married?",
  "33332": "Will that do now?",
  "33333": "How shall I put it on?",
  "33334": "And to what purpose?",
  "33335": "Mouston?",
  "33336": "How is your dear mother getting on?",
  "33337": "But you know how it all ended, don't you?",
  "33338": "Why did we choose it, this foolish task?",
  "33339": "Are you an alienist?",
  "33340": "Cannot ate it?",
  "33341": "You won't give it up?",
  "33342": "You are, I imagine, still of the same opinion?",
  "33343": "When are you going to be sensible, and think of your friends, and try and be a credit to them?",
  "33344": "Or not you so much, perhaps, as your friend in the city?",
  "33345": "Did you ask her how much?",
  "33346": "Is there no force on this side of the creek?",
  "33347": "If I guess rightly, will you confess it?",
  "33348": "Did you ever hear a definition of fame, sir?",
  "33349": "It is to be considered an honour, I suppose?",
  "33350": "Ay, but how shall we know the catchpole?",
  "33351": "What harm is there in that?",
  "33352": "Why are there men and women that while they are nigh me the sunlight expands my blood?",
  "33353": "Why, according to popular belief is it rather characterised by the very contrary?",
  "33354": "Shall we hold it as a province and govern it by despotic power?",
  "33355": "My dear doctor, what is my wife's complaint?",
  "33356": "Do we go all the way today?",
  "33357": "Oh, what does that matter?",
  "33358": "What place was there in her mind for a remonstrance to lodge in?",
  "33359": "Really and truly?",
  "33360": "If that were so, what had become of my father?",
  "33361": "But where is the last year's snow?",
  "33362": "How much will you ask to stay with her till the end?",
  "33363": "What can it be?",
  "33364": "Of whom are you jealous, now?",
  "33365": "What was the sense of that?",
  "33366": "I felt very ignorant, but what could I do?",
  "33367": "And what are you going to do with yourself now, if I may ask?",
  "33368": "What interest of hers was affected by the treaty?",
  "33369": "An order to who?",
  "33370": "Which is the stronger, the small stick that first PRODUCES the fire, or the fire itself?",
  "33371": "So you've been at the club?",
  "33372": "Don't you really?",
  "33373": "Has he been a good soldier except the desertion?",
  "33374": "Do you think not?",
  "33375": "Have you been looking for him, as I ordered?",
  "33376": "O, it an't?",
  "33377": "What you mought call me?",
  "33378": "Full of hope?",
  "33379": "And who will go?",
  "33380": "What is the news, whence is thy embassage?",
  "33381": "Farther?",
  "33382": "Should he slip away after having come and peeped into the barricade?",
  "33383": "Perhaps?",
  "33384": "Very well, my dear sir, and how does that concern us?",
  "33385": "But will the wild ass submit to the bonds?",
  "33386": "Where is the count?",
  "33387": "A whole one, and in a candlestick?",
  "33388": "Are you?",
  "33389": "Are you going to remain as you are, dear princess?",
  "33390": "What might have been your opinion of the place?",
  "33391": "Who defeated it?",
  "33392": "Plantation hand?",
  "33393": "For us, also?",
  "33394": "What is to be done with them?",
  "33395": "What would the life of a man be if he could feel no fear or repulsion?",
  "33396": "Is it really so that I may understand you, sir?",
  "33397": "Well, dad, what do you say about it?",
  "33398": "With what consolations can those, who have thus miscarried in their chief design, elude the memory of their ill success?",
  "33399": "Why did she love everything so tenderly and so passionately, everything living that was not a man?",
  "33400": "In favor of some member of your family?",
  "33401": "You are angry, monsieur?",
  "33402": "What, he told you so, I suppose?",
  "33403": "What, have they buried him in honour for his services to them?",
  "33404": "To stand from fear set free?",
  "33405": "When will they be required, sire?",
  "33406": "You are aware, I suppose, that all mythology and poetry is a narration of events, either past, present, or to come?",
  "33407": "Why do you go, sir?",
  "33408": "You called my father 'Michael' as if you knew him well?",
  "33409": "This DETOUR has been entirely for our benefit, then?",
  "33410": "What do you tell me?",
  "33411": "What was she like now?",
  "33412": "Call the captain, and heave the ship aback?",
  "33413": "And did you observe any change in her then?",
  "33414": "Flee alone, and leave you here?",
  "33415": "Can I have lost it?",
  "33416": "Are the sacrifices I have made of honour and modesty to you no proof of my being tied to you in bonds too strong to be broken?",
  "33417": "But what makes you so much out of sorts?",
  "33418": "Why, wherefore stay you?",
  "33419": "Who asked him while I was away?",
  "33420": "Don't you hear it?",
  "33421": "Jarndyce?",
  "33422": "Why, what's the matter?",
  "33423": "What does it depend upon?",
  "33424": "Now will you learn not to answer back when I speak to you?",
  "33425": "And what you think of it?",
  "33426": "But, on the other hand, did not the people evince decided obstinacy and insubordination?",
  "33427": "And my making it easy for you to see the child?",
  "33428": "Has anyone an interest in preventing your arrival there?",
  "33429": "Do you abuse your teacher?",
  "33430": "Has it struck you that we may not now choose to give over?",
  "33431": "And how do you like the place?",
  "33432": "Why do you not sit by his side and begin talking to him and asking him questions?",
  "33433": "You say papa will get better, and why shouldn't he?",
  "33434": "What have you got to be afraid of?",
  "33435": "What used he to say?",
  "33436": "Where the devil is mine?",
  "33437": "How do you feel yourself?",
  "33438": "That millions of others still exist, which are too minute for any observation?",
  "33439": "I suppose we might call her that?",
  "33440": "Don't you know that it is only very foolish folk who talk sense all the time?",
  "33441": "What's that to me?",
  "33442": "But you are sure you can act your part, and disguise your voice so that he may mistake that, as he has already mistaken your person?",
  "33443": "What would it matter if you smashed to smithereens at the end of the run, after a bust like that?",
  "33444": "Can someone have guessed our secret and dug up the watch?",
  "33445": "But what could he do but just let her see that he would make anything, everything, for her, as honourably easy as possible?",
  "33446": "How many cartridges did you say you had left?",
  "33447": "What then is worth being valued?",
  "33448": "What does this avail?",
  "33449": "This, then, was his father's residence?",
  "33450": "Fisher?",
  "33451": "Ain't there a small drop of something queer about that, eh?",
  "33452": "How like you that answer?",
  "33453": "But what shall we do?",
  "33454": "If it is a friend, why does he not show himself?",
  "33455": "Who then must decide?",
  "33456": "Can we with propriety suffer them to be rulers?",
  "33457": "Have you been here long?",
  "33458": "But why didn't you tell me?",
  "33459": "How can they suit each other?",
  "33460": "Do you see these?",
  "33461": "How do you prove that?",
  "33462": "Arsenic?",
  "33463": "Now, sir, what have you to say to me?",
  "33464": "I suppose we're going to have a talk about this?",
  "33465": "Let 'em both wait?",
  "33466": "Perhaps you would not mind walking to town with me?",
  "33467": "Love had bandaged his eyes, in order to lead him whither?",
  "33468": "It is not my intention to detain the reader by expa?",
  "33469": "Why ask?",
  "33470": "Am I to read this?",
  "33471": "Who are you then?",
  "33472": "Was there nothing to fear?",
  "33473": "But did this man hope to conceal himself effectually behind that heap of rubbish, which one need but skirt?",
  "33474": "Then it all depends on that object that you regard, for your reasons, as evidence?",
  "33475": "What if there was no rank of life in which she could now properly attach herself?",
  "33476": "Why then do philosophers look for public spirit?",
  "33477": "How many would he have?",
  "33478": "But do you know this mysterious count is a bachelor?",
  "33479": "Why strive for a coherent, satisfied life?",
  "33480": "You won't throw any more stones, will you?",
  "33481": "Intelligent you call yourselves, do you?",

  "33629": "But as for me, what solace had I when the days of my fighting were done?",
  "33630": "You were not unfortunate, and yet you are an orphan, fatherless and motherless?",
  "33631": "Would not that have been better evidence?",
  "33632": "Where was my head when I made that grant?",

  "33635": "And you order me to announce you to the duchess?",
  "33636": "What more has happened?",
  "33637": "Why did you not tell me, instead of teasing me like this?",
  "33638": "Judah told you?",
  "33639": "So far we are within the bounds of possibility, are we not?",
  "33640": "Will the train soon be in?",
  "33641": "What is your opinion?",
  "33642": "How was it, having so little in reality to conceal, that I always DID feel as if this man were finding me out?",

  "33656": "Then, when your articled time is over, you'll be a regular lawyer, I suppose?",
  "33657": "Would I do him this favour?",
  "33658": "Do you mind if I go in and tell this man to come on to us when he's finished here?",
  "33659": "Is it in this particular part, or in that other?",
  "33660": "Haven't I seen you blowing as hot as you please?",
  "33661": "Are you ready to get back the trade on those terms?",
  "33662": "To what does your ambition aspire?",

  "33783": "Who, then, has more luck than I have?",
  "33784": "When did they cease to be so?",
  "33785": "And what did you detect, if not gratitude?",
  "33786": "Speak I soothly, men of greenwood?",
  "33787": "Could misunderstanding be more complete, or sympathy worse misplaced?",
  "33788": "But what made her do that?",

  "33852": "Could he, too, write like that, express the melancholy of his soul in verse?",
  "33853": "So the question was, what to do?",
  "33854": "Well enough to question him in that language?",
  "33855": "But what's the meaning of it all?",
  "33856": "Then do you know what I did?",
  "33857": "Might I crave your favour to carry my name to him, and say I beg to say a word in his ear?",

  "34353": "But does not this question make a disturbance outside of political circles?",
  "34354": "What influence can I possibly have over a bandit?",
  "34355": "Why don't you make him speak?",
  "34356": "Is there a carriage at the door?",
  "34357": "Do you still wish to do so?",

  "34535": "The place is then, as you know, determined on rebellion?",
  "34536": "And was that the upshot of my life's hardest battle?",
  "34537": "When did you shed tears over lost souls?",
  "34538": "And the chief officer?",
  "34539": "Is it not horrible?",
  "34540": "On plantation?",
  "34541": "When you say it that way it sounds comical, does it not?",
  "34542": "What did you do with the girl?",
  "34543": "Who would want to injure us, or damage the projectile?",
  "34544": "How do you distinguish them?",

  "34546": "But if they don't do for us, if they're stupid?",
  "34547": "In the name of the ninth day, what manner of creature are you?",
  "34548": "It is then a service which you propose to render us, count?",
  "34549": "Whence comes this charm of the mustache, will you tell me?",
  "34550": "Why a blue coat?",
  "34551": "Are you here for good?",
  "34552": "What was I telling you?",
  "34553": "Snakes?",
  "34554": "May I ask you a question?",
  "34555": "And yet does not your honor fear to compromise yourself by allowing such a sum to be carried away for the service of your enemy?",
  "34556": "Then have we got to part?",
  "34557": "But what do you want to do with these chickens?",
  "34558": "Do you suggest that I should do that to a similarly garbed female?",
  "34559": "And if I do not read it, what shall you do, mamma?",

  "34572": "Fluffed in his lines, did he?",
  "34573": "But was resistance and, in the last place, victory possible?",
  "34574": "Ought not a son to love his father, whatever happens?",
  "34575": "Why, you wished to have a talk with me when the others left?",
  "34576": "Have you ever heard anything particular respecting his birth?",
  "34577": "But how did we become engaged?",
  "34578": "What, with the sacred treasure?",
  "34579": "Did this man belong to the double enigma of order and disorder?",

  "34586": "I am the ghost's accomplice?",
  "34587": "You 'eathen, where the mischief 'ave you been?",
  "34588": "And has not this been our own case in the matter of equals and of absolute equality?",

  "34680": "Isn't it too soon?",
  "34681": "What encouraged me not to become your surety, but to patronize you?",
  "34682": "Who ever gave again the breath of a life lost?",
  "34683": "Did he say when he would be back?",
  "34684": "Yes or no, is it an honorable indemnity?",
  "34685": "As how?",
  "34686": "Do you imagine that this anaemic youth was capable of so frightful an assault?",
  "34687": "I'd far better help you, hadn't I?",

  "34844": "Is there nobody in the house to cheer or help him?",
  "34845": "And the cardinal?",
  "34846": "Why should he not throw over his own people altogether, money, position, society, and all, and give himself up to love?",
  "34847": "Are you at all superstitious?",
  "34848": "But if they die?",
  "34849": "Rascal, eh?",
  "34850": "You approve of him?",
  "34851": "And who is thy father?",
  "34852": "And what was it that had suggested the tremendous tumult?",

  "34890": "What time did you dine?",
  "34891": "Would you tell him?",
  "34892": "Have you really burned it?",
  "34893": "Do you still remember your childhood?",
  "34894": "Well, what is it now?",
  "34895": "Did the old guy say anything more?",
  "34896": "As long as you know that it is not he, why do you say such foolish things?",
  "34897": "And I shall find your eminence ready?",
  "34898": "Why was his hair tinted with gold?",
  "34899": "You desire to fathom this horrible secret?",
  "34900": "Why, what DO they do to her, my lad?",

  "34917": "And why should you not do it?",
  "34918": "May we wait again to talk of it till she has done so?",
  "34919": "And what position will you adopt toward the government?",
  "34920": "Conscientiously?",
  "34921": "At what place?",
  "34922": "Or take revenge?",
  "34923": "So you intend to hinder us in our work, my daughter?",
  "34924": "And you know that, do you?",
  "34925": "Must I perish under the hands of savages?",

  "34967": "What did it ask you?",
  "34968": "What is this way?",
  "34969": "And what did the count do?",
  "34970": "Have we found our happy valley?",
  "34971": "What does all this mean?",
  "34972": "And now you will do me a favor, will you not?",
  "34973": "No, really, have you anything against me?",
  "34974": "What are you then?",
  "34975": "To whom are YOU of use?",
  "34976": "What mother, said the mayor, does the man mean?",
  "34977": "Does it matter so very much?",
  "34978": "If your comrades see him, what would they do?",
  "34979": "What will become of her, if you cast her off?",
  "34980": "If that is the case, why did you begin by making such a fuss about it?",
  "34981": "To engage in a contest with you?",
  "34982": "Who is that officer who appears in command?",
  "34983": "Do you think it will be a wet afternoon?",
  "34984": "Can you do nothing?",
  "34985": "Yet what is expectation but a kind of folly, and what is that folly but an excess of hope?",
  "34986": "But how do you, how can you, account for it not being there?",
  "34987": "And why by no other line?",
  "34988": "Counted every tree?",
  "34989": "What, then, of the future?",
  "34990": "Or did she wish by a sort of voluptuous stoicism to feel the more profoundly the bitterness of the things she was about to leave?",
  "34991": "They'll be here to dinner, then?",
  "34992": "And who can that person be who has taken it into his head to wrap himself up in a blue coat embroidered with green?",
  "34993": "He is peculiar, is he not?",
  "34994": "Whose image sanctifies the game?",
  "34995": "Don't you see how I'm pining away?",
  "34996": "Who would you suggest?",
  "34997": "Then how did you manage to find me?",
  "34998": "And it will be argued, that a man need be less thankful because, at the moment of receiving, he utters not thanksgiving?",
  "34999": "But what would you do?",
  "35000": "What is it then we can here dispute about?",
  "35001": "They must keep them there for that, don't they?",
  "35002": "Indeed, what living man could, by a mere morning visit, have surprised them more?",
  "35003": "That's your sort, is it?",
  "35004": "But what awaits us tomorrow?",
  "35005": "Any reward this time?",
  "35006": "You have found it out at last, have you?",
  "35007": "Is there a fire in the library?",
  "35008": "Contented?",
  "35009": "Why didn't she answer my avowal?",
  "35010": "How could I?",
  "35011": "And how far is it?",
  "35012": "And what do you think of a second principle?",
  "35013": "Can I help you?",
  "35014": "Is that at us?",
  "35015": "Is there any one in this village who lets out teams?",

  "35024": "Where is he now?",
  "35025": "And the rebels?",
  "35026": "Ay, and our ignorance maintain'd it as well, did it not?",
  "35027": "You wished to say a few more words?",
  "35028": "And the sister at the post?",
  "35029": "You do want to come, don't you?",
  "35030": "And when does the next train pass here?",
  "35031": "And what is there that we lay to the charge of the father?",
  "35032": "But when a girl can work out trigonometry at sight, what use can she possibly have for marriage?",

  "35038": "Whom have you lived with?",
  "35039": "How does this come about?",
  "35040": "Was it of a higher order?",
  "35041": "Word of honour?",
  "35042": "Which way shall I use it?",
  "35043": "Wonder if he O's as much there as he does here?",
  "35044": "Nor can the good harm any one?",
  "35045": "Who's the man?",
  "35046": "Where is the key of the green box?",
  "35047": "What, after yesterday?",
  "35048": "Tell me, are you a very learned man?",
  "35049": "Must it?",
  "35050": "Or would it be monstrous injustice and cruelty?",
  "35051": "Well, do you see the low hill beyond with the thornbush upon it?",
  "35052": "Didn't I offend him in some way?",
  "35053": "Don't know anything about the north, but am altogether salubrious and balmy, hey, my lady?",
  "35054": "Are five nights warmer than one night, then?",
  "35055": "Cannot the light penetrate these masses?",

  "35058": "Would you like to see them?",
  "35059": "Was he liberated, then?",
  "35060": "The true lover of learning then must from his earliest youth, as far as in him lies, desire all truth?",
  "35061": "The customs?",
  "35062": "Up from anywhere, then?",
  "35063": "You'd keep us poor if you could, wouldn't you?",
  "35064": "Where'd you get him?",
  "35065": "But what has happened, then, since last evening, count?",
  "35066": "Who is this creature?",
  "35067": "Picardet stop here?",
  "35068": "Where did you get swords from?",
  "35069": "If I were to accept from you one of these charming little ornaments as you suggest, what should I do with it?",
  "35070": "Did it not seem as if some person passed by the door here?",
  "35071": "How long would it take him to do that, using every possible contraction?",

  "35473": "Such will be the change, and after the change has been made, how will they proceed?",
  "35474": "I am to be neutral?",
  "35475": "What would the countess have done had she not been able sometimes to scold the invalid for not strictly obeying the doctor's orders?",
  "35476": "Hallo, what's that?",
  "35477": "It isn't too rough, is it?",
  "35478": "And what is it?",
  "35479": "Won't you have some tea?",
  "35480": "What is love?",
  "35481": "How did it come to pass that their lips met?",
  "35482": "But to what do you attribute this conduct?",
  "35483": "Can it be that any of you tread that soil and forget the great purposes for which those men bravely fought, or nobly died?",
  "35484": "What was the notion?",
  "35485": "I wonder whether I have lost anything really?",
  "35486": "What news have you brought me?",
  "35487": "And had you a great many smart beaux there?",
  "35488": "About what?",
  "35489": "What on earth was I to do?",
  "35490": "What has he in his hand there?",
  "35491": "He said I should object?",
  "35492": "By what right I ask?",
  "35493": "And what has procured me so fluttering a distinction?",
  "35494": "Why should women deny their favours to men?",
  "35495": "As governess?",
  "35496": "Isn't it lovely?",
  "35497": "Can I do anything to assist my old friends?",
  "35498": "Are you going to stay in town long?",
  "35499": "Why does the boat go so fast?",
  "35500": "You're fond of him?",
  "35501": "Is not the state the ruler's property?",
  "35502": "I felt a shiver run through me, and I asked 'The schoolmaster?",
  "35503": "He forgot I hadn't heard any of these splendid monologues on, what was it?",
  "35504": "What de matter now, massa?",
  "35505": "Are they both dead?",
  "35506": "What guide had I through the trackless waste of interplanetary space?",
  "35507": "And if the earth fell upon the sun?",
  "35508": "You don't mean to say that you came after me in spite of all?",
  "35509": "What the better for the succeeding wisdom?",
  "35510": "How shall we be benevolent?",
  "35511": "Why isn't the carpenter at the thrashing machine?",
  "35512": "Don't I see a tiny drop on one of the lashes?",
  "35513": "Where, then, sir?",
  "35514": "What must I do to attain such sublimity?",
  "35515": "You have never been married?",
  "35516": "What do they wear on their hands?",
  "35517": "And you, what do you think, young lady?",
  "35518": "Which way do we head?",
  "35519": "I take it for granted that since dawn every constable within forty miles has been looking out for a wet stranger?",
  "35520": "What have we to fear, anyhow?",
  "35521": "You said you had a clue?",
  "35522": "If it be said he cannot avoid them, shall this be in archery?",
  "35523": "How can a right to the land be based upon a difference in the quality of the land?",
  "35524": "Do you know it, or don't you know it?",
  "35525": "Shall I clap my hands and laugh, or what shall I do?",
  "35526": "But would he recognize her?",
  "35527": "Is this all?",
  "35528": "Dogs' heads, eh?",
  "35529": "You think?",
  "35530": "Would you murder me?",
  "35531": "Where can I drive you?",
  "35532": "There, did I do all right?",
  "35533": "Why stay to imbibe this sweet poison that was corroding the very springs of my life?",
  "35534": "Where now shall we seek them?",
  "35535": "Does that astonish you, my boy?",
  "35536": "Are you educated and he ignorant, you high and he low, you refined and he coarse, you talented and he simple?",
  "35537": "But isn't it dreadful, that it should happen?",
  "35538": "Whom else?",
  "35539": "Won't you let this be at my campfire tomorrow night?",
  "35540": "Would he ask for items?",
  "35541": "For the second time?",
  "35542": "Why do you men want so many boats?",
  "35543": "What's the use of bothering me with medicine?",
  "35544": "I trust that they do not mean that I have done anything to forfeit your confidence?",
  "35545": "Do you know where the wicked go after death?",
  "35546": "What is self?",
  "35547": "What particular figure have you in mind?",
  "35548": "Whom are you talking to?",
  "35549": "Which is it?",
  "35550": "What is this absorbs me quite?",
  "35551": "Why didn't you step into the road, my boy?",
  "35552": "Was there any possible reason other than the one she gave?",
  "35553": "What am I to write?",
  "35554": "Krook?",
  "35555": "Things for sale, or do you want to sell anything?",
  "35556": "Would the matter be carried as far as that?",
  "35557": "And what does she want the money for?",
  "35558": "Still leading his life of pleasure?",
  "35559": "Has he such might as to defy us all?",
  "35560": "What makes poor scoundrel rogues to beg, I pray you?",
  "35561": "You have nothing more to ask of me, my lord?",
  "35562": "Got a pin and a pencil, some of you?",
  "35563": "Against whom?",
  "35564": "You'll let me tell you, won't you?",
  "35565": "Would you like fine horses, or it may be some one has offended you, and you would like his head?",
  "35566": "Wisdom, virtue, enlightenment?",
  "35567": "And what could they be talking about?",
  "35568": "And that which is opposed to them is one of the inferior principles of the soul?",
  "35569": "We may reply, and by what right do you demand payment from us for labor which we did not impose upon you?",
  "35570": "Is it necessary to change my frock?",
  "35571": "Do you confess that you were a wicked traitor?",
  "35572": "Didn't find anything, eh?",
  "35573": "Then why didn't you say so at first?",
  "35574": "When did it take place?",
  "35575": "So how was the dog killed?",
  "35576": "And, of course, the horse and cart were ready?",
  "35577": "How dared I offer her attentions which were distasteful to her?",
  "35578": "For who but the rich of this world can thus afford to fling pearls away?",
  "35579": "Suppose you catch it?",
  "35580": "Pip why don't you take me into your life?",
  "35581": "And be merry?",
  "35582": "What are you about?",
  "35583": "What else?",
  "35584": "What's his name and address?",
  "35585": "How many times did he call upon his father?",
  "35586": "Did not the messenger say your father's safety depended upon it?",
  "35587": "Seeing then that the immortal is indestructible, must not the soul, if she is immortal, be also imperishable?",
  "35588": "Now, at once?",
  "35589": "Are we saved?",
  "35590": "Of what consequence to science is this interminable recital of crude facts, if your analysis never extracts a single idea from them?",
  "35591": "What, my dear, are you talking about?",
  "35592": "After all, who had seen him?",
  "35593": "From such beginning of governments, what could be expected but a continued system of war and extortion?",
  "35594": "And how much did they possess?",
  "35595": "Does he limit it to the few who did him the wrong, or does he take in the many?",
  "35596": "But why should I tell you all this?",
  "35597": "Well, isn't he a nasty man to get into such staggers at a morning wake?",
  "35598": "Do you think I will not listen to you?",
  "35599": "On what road, master?",
  "35600": "Why can't they let a girl marry three men, or as many as want her, and save all this trouble?",
  "35601": "My dear friend, of what consequence is it if she kills me?",
  "35602": "What link could there be between that creature and my wife?",
  "35603": "And do you think she is not there?",
  "35604": "The law?",
  "35605": "Will you go directly?",
  "35606": "Can it be that there remains to us only the recollection of them?",
  "35607": "Won't that be better than moping here?",
  "35608": "Not even if they were kind to you?",
  "35609": "And who will help you?",
  "35610": "And were these four men attached to each other, true in heart, really united?",
  "35611": "Have you let it?",
  "35612": "Why does the soul still tarry in my body?",
  "35613": "Who has ever heard of such a marvelous place?",
  "35614": "But in heaven's name, tell me, what was that?",
  "35615": "Where did you hear it?",
  "35616": "Are not the former administered by MEN as well as the latter?",
  "35617": "Do you see?",
  "35618": "And now, prisoner, will you consent to tell your name?",
  "35619": "Is he accompanied?",
  "35620": "Yes, but how?",
  "35621": "What weight can my blood add to the wool?",
  "35622": "How did he die?",
  "35623": "Says I, father, what on airth are you at?",
  "35624": "May not this prove dangerous?",
  "35625": "How is it all the better?",
  "35626": "Won't I tell mama?",
  "35627": "Don't tell me that she helped to set a trap for me?",
  "35628": "What dreadful thing will you do next?",
  "35629": "Is your wife at home?",
  "35630": "How did your tribute arise?",
  "35631": "Well, what are you doing here, and what is your name?",
  "35632": "Why shouldn't I marry her?",
  "35633": "What are you in such a hurry for?",
  "35634": "If you know my heart, then, can you not see that it is my heart I offer you?",
  "35635": "And yet how could it possibly be so?",
  "35636": "Well, are you so sure of the little gentleman?",
  "35637": "Was it you, sir?",
  "35638": "Have you noticed anything amiss with them of late?",
  "35639": "What purpose?",
  "35640": "What possessed him to do it?",
  "35641": "Or would you like another?",
  "35642": "You should sin less, and keep better in health?",
  "35643": "What advantage would it be to me to be anything else?",
  "35644": "Who would help him, when he was tired?",
  "35645": "Has your brother or the cat been meddling?",
  "35646": "Secondly, what are the best means, and the least expensive, for accomplishing those ends?",
  "35647": "Well, tell me, I have always wanted to know, did it hurt worse going in or coming out?",
  "35648": "Will I have eyes at the bottom of the sea, supposing I descend those endless stairs?",
  "35649": "You aren't angry?",
  "35650": "Do you understand it at last?",
  "35651": "Now you quit it, do you hear?",
  "35652": "What is to be done now?",
  "35653": "Has she slept through it?",
  "35654": "Was there any idea at all connected with it?",
  "35655": "Is this the man?",
  "35656": "You will take something or other, surely?",
  "35657": "Did you stop there?",
  "35658": "And where did you get so much money?",
  "35659": "But they'll recognize you?",
  "35660": "He made grandfather's coffin, didn't he?",
  "35661": "Have you any message?",
  "35662": "May I come out to you in the garden presently?",
  "35663": "Where has she gone?",
  "35664": "But what's the idea of your new picture?",
  "35665": "Why had he not known the difference between the political value and the imaginative value of these things?",
  "35666": "But would it not be salutary to give also the means of preventing their commission?",
  "35667": "What was it, I wondered, that was put into her pocket by her father as she stood crying there, just above me?",
  "35668": "Have all gentlemen's servants warts upon their noses, mother?",
  "35669": "Bene curasti hoc jumentam?",
  "35670": "Und you acknowledge tat you pe te blind dronk and te vool ?",
  "35671": "Who was right then?",
  "35672": "Don't you want to see your friends?",
  "35673": "Don't you feel well?",
  "35674": "Why to me?",
  "35675": "Did you see what a fool he looked?",
  "35676": "Have there not been enough killed?",
  "35677": "Perhaps a dodge?",
  "35678": "What is it for?",
  "35679": "Cannot you stay a few minutes longer?",
  "35680": "Do you refuse this lady's hand whom I now offer you?",
  "35681": "Where are you going there?",
  "35682": "Your lordship will recall inquiring of me on the night of the ball as to the bona fides of one of the temporary waiters?",
  "35683": "Would you set a cloud to chase the wind?",
  "35684": "The strength one can eke from little, who knows till he has been subjected to the trial?",
  "35685": "Would you, my reader, like to be more gentle in your manner?",
  "35686": "You had your portfolio with you, then?",
  "35687": "What is the good of repentance like that?",
  "35688": "What are ye for?",
  "35689": "They are laying supper over there, are they?",
  "35690": "You have some in the house, have you not?",
  "35691": "Am I master of the house?",
  "35692": "Did he then love the rhythmic rise and fall of words better than their associations of legend and colour?",
  "35693": "Is not the most important problem that of getting the right man at the head of the company?",
  "35694": "Now, then, who can point out any sinless person in the present world?",
  "35695": "That was really what we meant, wasn't it?",
  "35696": "You are in love?",
  "35697": "WHAT IS IT?",
  "35698": "Shall I love all men, then, for the sake of one?",
  "35699": "Need I say de more?",
  "35700": "How can they, he said, when they are not allowed to apply their minds to the callings of any of these?",
  "35701": "Are you really not to be persuaded, even now, to pass the night under my roof?",
  "35702": "What for, then?",
  "35703": "Is my husband's political career likely to suffer through this incident?",
  "35704": "Besides, where were these poor girls to go?",
  "35705": "Do you really think so?",
  "35706": "Say, that fits like a T, don't it?",
  "35707": "About what am I now employing my own soul?",
  "35708": "Do you speak by way of offence, sir?",
  "35709": "Why did you name them all with the same name?",
  "35710": "Well, I ask, what can the intervention of power, with the assistance of civil law and political economy, accomplish here?",
  "35711": "A bottle, perhaps?",
  "35712": "What do you expect to do in the midst of this darkness?",
  "35713": "You wouldn't mind that?",
  "35714": "And did she not even go to him?",
  "35715": "What other forces were arrayed?",
  "35716": "And why do they worry me so?",
  "35717": "Young men are all very well in their place, but it doesn't do to drag them into everything, does it?",
  "35718": "What becomes, then, of the doctrine of expiation and abstinence, the morality of sacrifice, resignation, and happy moderation?",
  "35719": "Can smiles make a man a better master or a better citizen?",
  "35720": "If she makes up her mind to tell you, you will come and let me know, will you not?",
  "35721": "What is this rubbish?",
  "35722": "Don't you know?",
  "35723": "What is he doing there?",
  "35724": "Suicide?",
  "35725": "Her name and family?",
  "35726": "What knave is this?",
  "35727": "But what did I know?",
  "35728": "Had he reached the point of forgetting the mayor's presence?",
  "35729": "Three?",
  "35730": "How could she do it, how can it be possible that she is a woman like that?",
  "35731": "Can we find any such connection in the case of a public work executed by a government?",
  "35732": "What sort of an entertainment, captain?",
  "35733": "How did he make it enter in?",
  "35734": "Whence, comrade?",
  "35735": "What do you reckon did it, boys?",
  "35736": "How do you help it?",
  "35737": "Is it not truly to clothe the naked, to procure for them a garment of light, a raiment of glory?",
  "35738": "Just give me one of those roses in the bunch you are wearing, will you?",
  "35739": "Harrison?",
  "35740": "Unless indeed you know me, and have some purpose in your brain?",
  "35741": "Is he conscious?",
  "35742": "Had his forms of expression changed, or his sentiments become less laudable?",
  "35743": "But what is it you wish?",
  "35744": "Why notice it?",
  "35745": "Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?",
  "35746": "On what charge?",
  "35747": "Is he not a handsome lad?",
  "35748": "Haue you hope of life?",
  "35749": "What is the remedy?",
  "35750": "You think so, do you?",
  "35751": "What would he himself say a couple of years after the event?",
  "35752": "How are you to act?",
  "35753": "Is it long since you came?",
  "35754": "By you?",
  "35755": "And will you let me play a few of your accompaniments?",
  "35756": "Sell my rapier?",
  "35757": "Is he prosperous and happy?",
  "35758": "Why will not people lend their money?",
  "35759": "Guess what?",
  "35760": "For sheer terror?",
  "35761": "Did you know this?",
  "35762": "What did I tell you about making me creak the door?",
  "35763": "And in what consists this plot?",
  "35764": "Shall I fetch you another cup?",
  "35765": "How's that for high living?",
  "35766": "Then for what reason did he call me son?",
  "35767": "And why do you keep following me about?",
  "35768": "Is it worth while to keep an army to protect you in writing proclamations, or to get once a year into winter quarters?",
  "35769": "Well, what's to be done?",
  "35770": "You mean you'll join us?",
  "35771": "Why don't you tell me what's the matter with you?",
  "35772": "Have you given this man work before?",
  "35773": "In the way, you mean, of living with US?",
  "35774": "Is he from home?",
  "35775": "Is there a house in the neighborhood?",
  "35776": "What were you doing on that armchair?",
  "35777": "What say my other friends?",
  "35778": "Some one?",
  "35779": "Do you then suspect any one?",
  "35780": "But why should you have been anxious?",
  "35781": "What size do you want to be?",
  "35782": "Now, is there any sense in these things?",
  "35783": "What manner of man is he?",
  "35784": "Don't you think it's rather a good idea?",
  "35785": "I might let that to you, for what matters it to me?",
  "35786": "What was the opinion?",
  "35787": "Whence comes this to pass, my masters?",
  "35788": "Nothing to you?",
  "35789": "Won't you be mine?",
  "35790": "I suppose you have had dinner?",
  "35791": "Where in the word did you acquire such a voluminous vocabulary?",
  "35792": "And what if other benefits were gained by peace?",
  "35793": "What is it, father?",
  "35794": "That wasn't wrong, was it?",
  "35795": "What did you tell him?",
  "35796": "From the cardinal?",
  "35797": "Is it far from here, sir?",
  "35798": "Do you mean to say you don't know where?",
  "35799": "When was he married?",
  "35800": "Don't you dread the attitude that insensibly arises out of legal obligation?",
  "35801": "And you don't want to go again to night?",
  "35802": "Was she beautiful?",
  "35803": "You're staying the night, I hope?",
  "35804": "Come now, where has this great commander of yours shown his skill?",
  "35805": "What would I want wedding so young?",
  "35806": "What IOU's?",
  "35807": "Do you know anything?",
  "35808": "That's interesting, eh?",
  "35809": "Isn't he charming?",
  "35810": "Whither so soon?",
  "35811": "Hain't you never seen him?",
  "35812": "Did you find no trace of him?",
  "35813": "The sovereigns?",
  "35814": "A physician?",
  "35815": "Where ought I be, then?",
  "35816": "Who said that she was to belong to you?",
  "35817": "Have you found anything discreditable?",
  "35818": "Wouldn't you go a day's journey, if you were in my place?",
  "35819": "In this place?",
  "35820": "I said 'people,' didn't I?",
  "35821": "You mean it is a little dry, perhaps?",
  "35822": "You are not touched even by that danger?",
  "35823": "Then this racket they are making is on account of it, I suppose?",
  "35824": "For what is he in prison then?",
  "35825": "Would exasperation, however, if relief had longer been postponed, finally have betrayed me?",
  "35826": "What did I mean by asking questions?",
  "35827": "Will you dance with me?",
  "35828": "Can you dive?",
  "35829": "More rabbits?",
  "35830": "For this?",
  "35831": "Was there any connection between the commotion of the atmosphere and that of the interior of the earth?",
  "35832": "Has your master come?",
  "35833": "A merry going forth bringeth often a sorrowful return, and a merry evening maketh a sad morning?",
  "35834": "And even of what he knew, how much could he make his untravelled friend either apprehend or believe?",
  "35835": "When did you enter the room?",
  "35836": "Whom have I to live for?",
  "35837": "And how about the savages?",
  "35838": "Going to lose her?",
  "35839": "For such matters?",
  "35840": "And do you object to going through the village?",
  "35841": "What do you think of that figure there?",
  "35842": "To how many people can any one tell all?",
  "35843": "Could a body hypocritically take there a small hypocritical touch?",
  "35844": "How have they made me a victim?",
  "35845": "But where can he be?",
  "35846": "How am I?",
  "35847": "And what did she say?",
  "35848": "What could he have done to me?",
  "35849": "Do you take us for thieves?",
  "35850": "For a young cobra?",
  "35851": "And how did you like the master?",
  "35852": "He won't have it?",
  "35853": "Theramenes?",
  "35854": "France?",
  "35855": "Tell me, my dear sir, do you admit the existence of volcanoes on the moon's surface?",
  "35856": "What could be the meaning of his sudden change toward me?",
  "35857": "He warned you to abandon your visit?",
  "35858": "Did you really come to propose to me?",
  "35859": "And then, you ungrateful being, you are not pleased to see an old friend?",
  "35860": "Will you return to this gang of robbers, and to this man, when a word can save you?",
  "35861": "Because of the money?",
  "35862": "Who could place my feet on the right path, and bring me back to my company?",

  "36006": "Have you ever told a lie?",
  "36007": "If he forces us to it, they'll be producible, won't they?",
  "36008": "You have seen it on dozens of girls, and you never found out that it was pretty till now?",
  "36009": "What, the whole property there?",
  "36010": "But don't you know it is extremely wicked to do such things?",
  "36011": "Is it so important to you?",
  "36012": "What fiend possesses you to stare back at me, continually, with those infernal eyes?",

  "36050": "Why will you not grant my last wish?",
  "36051": "Do you pay taxes to an agent that he may destroy your property?",
  "36052": "He would have to fly, and where?",
  "36053": "In a figurative sense, how far, and to what offences, may it be extended?",
  "36054": "And what do you think of him?",
  "36055": "The register of my child's birth?",
  "36056": "Was there one exception, and that one he who needed to have been most happy?",

  "36081": "D'you remember the last time we met?",
  "36082": "What hope could there have been for him then?",
  "36083": "You have no mother?",
  "36084": "Outside of a private car?",
  "36085": "How is she ever to do better?",
  "36086": "You had heard that there was an execution in the house?",
  "36087": "Can you see where he has put his rifle or his bow?",
  "36088": "But who the deuce is he following?",
  "36089": "Are not necessary pleasures those of which we cannot get rid, and of which the satisfaction is a benefit to us?",
  "36090": "Can they understand or explain even their own characters?",
  "36091": "And why so?",
  "36092": "Is he a good doctor, my love?",

  "36114": "Perhaps you would like to pay interest?",
  "36115": "Which is she?",
  "36116": "Is that any reason why we should propose to preserve it for ever in a condition of tutelage?",
  "36117": "And my walking up and down for three hours from the table to the stove?",
  "36118": "Not chops?",
  "36119": "Isn't she a clever thing?",
  "36120": "Would he choose the peers, for example?",

  "36130": "But you didn't have much to do with him, did you?",
  "36131": "What WILL he do, then?",
  "36132": "Where do you expect to get to?",
  "36133": "Your birthday?",
  "36134": "What have your family got to do with it?",
  "36135": "How much do I get?",
  "36136": "But may he not change and transform himself?",
  "36137": "It is not so?",
  "36138": "Then I shall really have them?",
  "36139": "So you go back from your promise?",
  "36140": "May she?",
  "36141": "Do you remember what I said when you asked me what I should do if I won all the pots I set my heart on and came through alive?",
  "36142": "Is it too great?",
  "36143": "At it again, hey?",
  "36144": "Which was it?",
  "36145": "Then why don't you send this new cove?",
  "36146": "Do you believe in presentiments and superstitions?",

  "36185": "Had they not searched exactly where the document stated?",
  "36186": "How you like it, hey, ole sport?",
  "36187": "But what human language can adequately portray that astonishment, that horror which possessed me at the spectacle then presented to view?",

  "36346": "Do you seek any guidance from me?",
  "36347": "How on earth should she talk of any one else as long as you are here?",
  "36348": "And a narrative it remains both in the speeches which the poet recites from time to time and in the intermediate passages?",
  "36349": "And others say even that the external world is the work of our organs?",
  "36350": "Am I sorry?",

  "36388": "No bad?",
  "36389": "How can they be helped, mama?",
  "36390": "And is not their humanity to the condemned in some cases quite charming?",
  "36391": "Is it not because they have not enough at home wherewith to fill their bellies and their pokes?",
  "36392": "You suppose they really TALK of them?",
  "36393": "Don't you see anything?",
  "36394": "Do you know, my husband, why I came here?",
  "36395": "What, was it conscience then?",

  "36405": "Why had he come to this house?",
  "36406": "What are you going on in this way at me for?",
  "36407": "And if that is true, what sort of general must he have been?",
  "36408": "What's the case now?",
  "36409": "Why may I not rest me from this restlessness and sleep from this wide waking?",
  "36410": "And do you know this gentleman, monsieur?",

  "36649": "If we acted in time, might we not even yet escape before the general alarm was sounded?",
  "36650": "What more?",
  "36651": "Why do you do it?",
  "36652": "Laurie, I want you to do me a favor, will you?",
  "36653": "But you will come to the races?",
  "36654": "Then she looks upon you as a stranger?",
  "36655": "Do you hear his worship ask if you've anything to say?",
  "36656": "And now, vile wretches, do you desire to treat with me by word of mouth?",
  "36657": "Don't you hear that beautiful music?",
  "36658": "Is this your decision, monseigneur?",
  "36659": "And what good does it do you?",
  "36660": "Have you the nerve to go through with it?",
  "36661": "Quaere?",
  "36662": "What can I say to describe the wonderful effects of such a pure and unpolluted air?",
  "36663": "But after all, what did it matter?",
  "36664": "Can you tell me what I am spinning?",
  "36665": "How does the fellow manage to love two of them?",
  "36666": "Why cannot we walk outside like the meteor?",
  "36667": "Did perhaps their hearts despond, because lonesomeness had swallowed me like a whale?",
  "36668": "Can there be no mistake?",
  "36669": "Is it something I am not to repeat?",
  "36670": "And the teal, with what shall we cut that up?",
  "36671": "And now, under the bridge, the master of them all pressed her to himself?",
  "36672": "Say, wouldn't it be great if we ran down one?",
  "36673": "How is it possible to extort a meaning from all this jargon about 'devil's seats,' 'death's heads,' and 'bishop's hotels?",
  "36674": "When shall I see you again?",
  "36675": "And what may be the ages of these two, ma'am?",
  "36676": "Who, then, would not imagine that such conduct as will inevitably destroy what all are thus labouring to acquire, must generally be avoided?",
  "36677": "Was she going to try to bulldoze him into submission?",
  "36678": "But what about you?",
  "36679": "What's your pleasure, gentlemen?",
  "36680": "Was he as innocent as he looked?",
  "36681": "What did she look like?",
  "36682": "If ye could come thither, perchance ye might escape, but how can ye come thither?",
  "36683": "Shall this class of legislation just now beginning with us be general or special?",
  "36684": "You don't know me very well, do you, even now?",
  "36685": "And you didn't really know anything of this when you saw her?",
  "36686": "Who, my dear?",
  "36687": "And how long will the case last?",
  "36688": "Did he come quiet?",
  "36689": "But ten?",
  "36690": "You surely would not desert her?",
  "36691": "Was D'Artagnan going straight to the king?",
  "36692": "The great stake?",
  "36693": "Are they not our most mortal foes?",
  "36694": "How do you mean to settle this affair?",
  "36695": "Would this misery last for ever?",
  "36696": "Are you really throwing us all over, little mother?",
  "36697": "Someone in a novel, was he not?",
  "36698": "Then why is it done?",
  "36699": "Who can undertake to say that he is not a sham in anything?",
  "36700": "How are you now?",
  "36701": "Did he understand all those mysterious murmurs which warn or importune the spirit at certain moments of life?",
  "36702": "Has she been presented?",
  "36703": "Is the shipwreck due to the pilot?",
  "36704": "It is all over, is it not?",
  "36705": "He's nice?",
  "36706": "Pretended?",
  "36707": "Are you mixing that other bowl of punch?",
  "36708": "Am I grown?",
  "36709": "What a horrible vision affronted my eyes?",
  "36710": "We aren't likely to meet anyone?",
  "36711": "Would she not allow him to go and wade in the mud?",
  "36712": "The rickety rafters?",
  "36713": "No son?",
  "36714": "Or what are they ornamented with?",
  "36715": "Didn't the girls laugh at the picture?",
  "36716": "And they are all in for this examination?",
  "36717": "And the ear has an end and an excellence also?",
  "36718": "But why shall we go there?",
  "36719": "You are not angry with me for coming?",
  "36720": "Did you ever see the like of it in your life?",
  "36721": "I trust and hope you never repeated to the count all the foolish remarks we used to make about him?",
  "36722": "Why, let me see, how old are you?",
  "36723": "What else could he do?",
  "36724": "That voice?",
  "36725": "And these men were your friends?",
  "36726": "Why didn't you wait for me?",
  "36727": "What better issues could a man want?",
  "36728": "Not to be afraid really to speak?",
  "36729": "I call it a very serious thing, eh?",
  "36730": "Have you any more conditions to offer?",
  "36731": "What time did you start?",
  "36732": "And with what result?",
  "36733": "An't my place dirty?",
  "36734": "And now you will be our companion?",
  "36735": "And what is this way?",
  "36736": "Because?",
  "36737": "Which route must I take?",
  "36738": "Now, what is it you say?",
  "36739": "And do you dare look in my face, after that shameful deed?",
  "36740": "Let me ask, sir, what great exploits have you performed?",
  "36741": "Why have you come?",
  "36742": "What wages do you ask?",
  "36743": "It makes you feel very virtuous when you forgive people, doesn't it?",
  "36744": "But where are they taking her?",
  "36745": "Doing anything now, are you?",
  "36746": "It relates to some great event, then?",
  "36747": "Have you any letters of hers?",
  "36748": "How should any one coming from a wider world not feel the difference and be attracted by it?",
  "36749": "And how is it she has not pride enough to see it?",
  "36750": "Is she feeling the same as I?",
  "36751": "What is his extent?",
  "36752": "Then the truth is too bad to tell?",
  "36753": "Can this be, then?",
  "36754": "Which is your house?",
  "36755": "Where else can he be?",
  "36756": "What should I be but for you?",
  "36757": "Ah, then, you do not love me?",
  "36758": "Many of them?",
  "36759": "Oh, you do, do you?",
  "36760": "And this is a letter, is it?",
  "36761": "How do you get your dinner, then?",
  "36762": "Where shall I find you?",
  "36763": "And why not players strut in courtiers' clothes?",
  "36764": "Will you fight me?",
  "36765": "What do you suppose he meant?",
  "36766": "Do you love me still?",
  "36767": "Which is the way out, please?",
  "36768": "Now, what's your name?",
  "36769": "How can it, by coming quickly into the eyes and ears, distinguish the pleasing from the disgusting in external objects?",
  "36770": "You love it, do you?",
  "36771": "And, yet, how could it be otherwise?",
  "36772": "Why had this agent preserved silence?",
  "36773": "They include, I presume, correspondence?",
  "36774": "How can you not know?",
  "36775": "Who of any dignity would take the trouble to clear cobwebs from a wild man's mind after such language as this?",
  "36776": "But how came he to be there?",
  "36777": "Do you wish to destroy me?",
  "36778": "Don't you think that rather too late?",
  "36779": "And he who is most skilful in preventing or escaping from a disease is best able to create one?",
  "36780": "What remained to her of primitive virtue?",
  "36781": "This, sir?",
  "36782": "Jo, dear, what is it?",
  "36783": "How would you like to have some tableaux in here?",
  "36784": "With this boy?",
  "36785": "Do you know who I am?",
  "36786": "When I spoke in confidence to your brother, could I regard him as an inquisitor?",
  "36787": "Did you court her for her wealth?",
  "36788": "Have I met you and passed you already, unknowing, unthinking and blind?",
  "36789": "You are acquainted?",
  "36790": "But what would be the use of new continents?",
  "36791": "Have I kept my promise, yes or no?",
  "36792": "There used to be a certain amount of solidity in all things, but now what happens?",
  "36793": "Because I love the court?",
  "36794": "Can one ever tell anyone what one is feeling?",
  "36795": "When the company was gone, my master asked my father, if he smoked?",
  "36796": "Who knows how easy it is for ambition to call itself vocation?",
  "36797": "Was it my mother's or my father's act?",
  "36798": "Is this a carelessness, or what?",
  "36799": "Weak?",
  "36800": "Aren't you ashamed of yourself, a husky young chap like you in mufti when men are needed in the trenches?",
  "36801": "Might they not hang him at once, and inquire into his case afterward?",
  "36802": "What do they say?",
  "36803": "Had she really any life of her own behind all her propagandism?",
  "36804": "Do you think this would be the first time a woman had repented of an infidelity?",
  "36805": "Do you think our little girl here need be afraid?",
  "36806": "Can you tell me why you foster the cruel deception?",
  "36807": "What else has the world given me for all that I have done for it?",
  "36808": "And what good will it do you?",
  "36809": "The servants can't miss the way?",
  "36810": "Why joke?",
  "36811": "What is he like, uncle?",
  "36812": "And is not the truest pity, when a man has a sore point, not to touch it at all?",
  "36813": "But you couldn't see what they were like, in the dark, lad, I suppose?",
  "36814": "Are you satisfied?",
  "36815": "Surely no man is trying to kill you either by fraud or by force?",
  "36816": "Who would hear her?",
  "36817": "Do you not see that they are all giving me the wink, and wanting me to turn you out by force, only I do not like to do so?",
  "36818": "What's the good of asking yourself if you know you don't know?",
  "36819": "And are you glad to see me?",
  "36820": "And what is the pay?",
  "36821": "Has he now some disciples?",
  "36822": "To sleep?",
  "36823": "What'll it be?",
  "36824": "But a little rakish, hey?",
  "36825": "With friends like that, who needs enemies?",
  "36826": "A bride?",
  "36827": "Or what is become of them?",
  "36828": "Is he indeed, sir?",
  "36829": "He will not talk to me about it, so why should I trouble him?",
  "36830": "But is not your eminence going to the queen?",
  "36831": "At once?",
  "36832": "Will it be long first?",
  "36833": "Don't you see what I mean?",
  "36834": "But am I sure?",
  "36835": "Rita?",
  "36836": "Who took that step?",
  "36837": "What's better in him?",
  "36838": "Did she herself wear it embroidered on her gowns?",
  "36839": "But why should I make a long story?",
  "36840": "If error is possible there, why not here?",
  "36841": "Nothing else?",
  "36842": "You say 'What are they regarding?",
  "36843": "Have you not left off your impudent pretensions there yet?",
  "36844": "That is all true, then, is it?",
  "36845": "Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary clothes on?",
  "36846": "May we see it now?",
  "36847": "What's to be done?",
  "36848": "Was he the only applicant?",
  "36849": "A man who has paid every penalty for wrong, if wrong there was?",
  "36850": "You surely will not do that, my dear count?",
  "36851": "What did this mean?",
  "36852": "What mysterious thing can this be?",
  "36853": "Well, sir, what is it?",
  "36854": "In what place, captain?",
  "36855": "Then where are the other people?",
  "36856": "Very bad, eh?",
  "36857": "What do you think of this?",
  "36858": "Where is your justification for inflicting all this pain?",
  "36859": "Why should we consider ourselves, men and women, as broken fragments of one whole?",
  "36860": "Then, is she dying?",
  "36861": "Are you all right now?",
  "36862": "Where've you hid your letters?",
  "36863": "What is the matter with her?",
  "36864": "And what favor, pray?",
  "36865": "What do you want to have me here for?",
  "36866": "Are you then tired of peace?",
  "36867": "What mad pursuit?",
  "36868": "Why not?",
  "36869": "But what would you have me do, child?",
  "36870": "Had she tried her strength again, what had that availed?",
  "36871": "Do you hear what I say?",
  "36872": "Of what complexion?",
  "36873": "Is she to be shown up to your room?",
  "36874": "And, if I said so, to whom would the place belong?",
  "36875": "Is no one about who can get in?",
  "36876": "You called me, didn't you?",
  "36877": "Will you have brilliants, or a castle by the sea, or, perhaps, a yacht?",
  "36878": "Do they follow us so far?",
  "36879": "But even if one might, what feeling except veneration could such a man as my father evoke?",
  "36880": "Who will give it to me?",
  "36881": "Who is so bold as to do it?",
  "36882": "Why did you come here to find me, then?",
  "36883": "English?",
  "36884": "Vot is de reason a big man like you has got only a dollar und a quarter?",
  "36885": "Can I be always by your side?",
  "36886": "Auntie, what have I done?",
  "36887": "Where's your shells?",
  "36888": "Is it your business, eh?",
  "36889": "Do you see that island?",
  "36890": "You think that she would refuse me?",
  "36891": "Did you sleep badly?",
  "36892": "Is it because we are invited?",
  "36893": "Will you walk a little bit with me?",
  "36894": "Do you deny that you were listening at that door?",
  "36895": "How soon may we hope to get back?",
  "36896": "Is the wind north or south?",
  "36897": "Yet how could he think her capable of deliberately wishing to renew their assignations now?",
  "36898": "Aluminum?",
  "36899": "How could it have been me?",
  "36900": "What makes you say that?",
  "36901": "And who will be the warden of the hospital?",
  "36902": "Is this the man that is to raise a breeze in his favor by abusing lawyers?",
  "36903": "What's that that has fallen?",
  "36904": "Has judgment been pronounced?",
  "36905": "And who is the criminal?",
  "36906": "Can you row?",
  "36907": "Can he spare you?",
  "36908": "Shall we ever know?",
  "36909": "But who the devil has fortified this paltry little place in this manner?",
  "36910": "Do you remember any case at all like it?",
  "36911": "What am I to do now?",
  "36912": "Won't it be lovely to go home in the dark?",
  "36913": "Isn't it a beauty?",
  "36914": "About me?",
  "36915": "Brooke?",
  "36916": "Is it funny?",
  "36917": "But if so, where was the girl, and what had she done with the papers?",
  "36918": "And you did not know any one else on the train?",
  "36919": "You, a man already endowed with a man's discretion?",
  "36920": "You intend to remain?",
  "36921": "And cannot women be dishonored by appearances?",
  "36922": "No guarantee?",
  "36923": "Are you asking for a lodger?",
  "36924": "And if it knew, would it dare?",
  "36925": "And what do you call that little metal ruler?",
  "36926": "What is advantage?",
  "36927": "You are not going, papa?",
  "36928": "Is that what you have been trying?",
  "36929": "My little woman, why do you look at me in that way?",
  "36930": "What do you want to say?",
  "36931": "Is yours a long part?",
  "36932": "Gentle?",
  "36933": "What is POLITICS?",
  "36934": "What did their tears imply?",
  "36935": "What shall the court do?",
  "36936": "But what do YOU think?",
  "36937": "If he had not lost his balance, why should he have launched into an almost passionate defence of the physical coward?",
  "36938": "What is the object of these questions?",
  "36939": "Oh you're there, are you?",
  "36940": "How much may it amount to?",
  "36941": "Shall I tell him all, then, openly?",
  "36942": "Oswald, have you not your mother to come to the rescue?",
  "36943": "O, do you know me, man?",
  "36944": "And how do you get on with the officers?",
  "36945": "How dare you come when you're not wanted?",
  "36946": "Whence was consciousness awakened?",
  "36947": "Is it certainly accursed?",
  "36948": "But to do this he must have spoken?",
  "36949": "Have you ever died yet?",
  "36950": "Who would ever suspect me, me, me, especially if I should choose a being I had no interest in doing away with?",
  "36951": "Trust to the sword the fortunes of the world?",
  "36952": "Where is your crown, then?",
  "36953": "And even if there's a delay, how can it alter the end?",
  "36954": "It will not be opened when the hearing is resumed?",
  "36955": "Then what does he do?",
  "36956": "Have the rebels been successful up to this time?",
  "36957": "You saw this?",
  "36958": "Whom choose ye for master?",
  "36959": "You want a serious duel?",
  "36960": "Are not your people dead?",
  "36961": "Will you lose by him, then?",
  "36962": "Kenneth?",
  "36963": "Who could have taken it out?",
  "36964": "Haven't you had enough of starvation yet?",
  "36965": "You don't like the idea of being a milestone?",
  "36966": "Your little share?",
  "36967": "Are you hurt?",
  "36968": "And why be at the charge of providing logic of the best quality, when a very inferior article will be equally acceptable?",
  "36969": "Or rather at what he said?",
  "36970": "Then in what do you intend to be married, unnatural girl?",
  "36971": "Have you nearly concluded your argument?",
  "36972": "What, in short, is his character?",
  "36973": "What's the matter?",
  "36974": "And you don't want to know how I got here?",
  "36975": "Where can she have come from?",
  "36976": "What's his trade?",
  "36977": "Yet why not?",
  "36978": "Does he not perceive us?",
  "36979": "Has she?",
  "36980": "Who is entitled to the rent of the land?",
  "36981": "Would it not be wise for us to make a change?",
  "36982": "How might he be more brave?",
  "36983": "As, indeed, how should any of those prim and reputable virgins?",
  "36984": "What was that noise about?",
  "36985": "Have you watched?",
  "36986": "Twas shameful, was it not?",
  "36987": "Or is it only because you must?",
  "36988": "Had a bath this morning?",
  "36989": "What shall I say or do?",
  "36990": "Are you then pressed for this money?",
  "36991": "Mightn't one, to reach his mind, risk the stretch of an angular arm over his character?",
  "36992": "What's that you got?",
  "36993": "Pardon this rascal?",
  "36994": "The sound of the spur?",
  "36995": "Not a civil list?",
  "36996": "Now you laugh?",
  "36997": "And is this true of all opposites?",
  "36998": "Then you did come 'to fight,' I may conclude?",
  "36999": "She is a living creature, why should she stand anything, just because you choose to make her?",
  "37000": "A minister?",
  "37001": "Who am I?",
  "37002": "Are there many descends between here and the place whither you are going?",
  "37003": "What have we all done, then, dear grandpapa?",
  "37004": "Is anybody suspected?",
  "37005": "The exact sum?",
  "37006": "I JUSTICE, WHETHER A NATURAL OR ARTIFICIAL VIRTUE?",
  "37007": "My commands?",
  "37008": "Or rather do I not wrong those whom I ought least to wrong?",
  "37009": "Which is best, to draw from nature or from the antique?",
  "37010": "Is he not much handsomer and better built than that great chucklehead?",
  "37011": "Or any greater good than the bond of unity?",
  "37012": "What now could he do for his boy except die?",
  "37013": "And if that's the case, what do they mean by wanting me to believe that he is enchanted?",
  "37014": "It must be pretty bad, mustn't it?",
  "37015": "What are you saying about the militia?",
  "37016": "A horse and two men?",
  "37017": "You will say nothing to me?",
  "37018": "Looking after your niece when you're dead and gone, and getting a husband for her, eh?",
  "37019": "Will you give me the first son you have?",
  "37020": "Ah, is it you, baron?",
  "37021": "Jeanette?",
  "37022": "How did you get out of it?",
  "37023": "What would you recommend me to READ?",
  "37024": "When did she first hear of it?",
  "37025": "How do you know she has not seen them?",
  "37026": "You're living, aren't you?",
  "37027": "Have you brought me any more?",
  "37028": "Have you heard any bad news?",
  "37029": "Where had she been during that strange expedition?",
  "37030": "You will, won't you?",
  "37031": "But what is the meaning of all these soldiers everywhere?",
  "37032": "Was that a work for your hands?",
  "37033": "But how does that knowledge help us?",
  "37034": "Did they know her?",
  "37035": "Might not the philosopher elevate himself above faith in grammar?",
  "37036": "Where was the ceremony performed?",
  "37037": "Who is he?",
  "37038": "What is it to me, who have passed twenty years between life and death?",
  "37039": "You do not fear, I imagine, that these gentlemen could stave in walls on which the balls of your frigate have had no effect?",
  "37040": "That little log house where there was a pile of pumpkins in the yard?",
  "37041": "Did she now?",
  "37042": "Where is everybody?",
  "37043": "But how?",
  "37044": "What's verdigrease?",
  "37045": "But the general and his succor?",
  "37046": "But if you knew all this why didn't you get out before?",
  "37047": "Is the poor gentleman much hurt?",
  "37048": "But what made them let us go?",
  "37049": "What is dreadful?",

  "37069": "Are we really going to be walking around the moon inside of thirty minutes?",
  "37070": "Why do you speak of a housemaid so contemptuously?",
  "37071": "You surely do not suppose that I have nothing better to do than to study such publications as these?",
  "37072": "Will you move quickly?",
  "37073": "What SHOULD they get out of him?",
  "37074": "You are not wounded, I hope?",

  "37090": "What does that mean, romantic?",
  "37091": "Could it?",
  "37092": "Those charming meetings?",
  "37093": "Why should they be, when we will win them back?",
  "37094": "And did it hurt much?",
  "37095": "Do you hear the cracking?",
  "37096": "And who shall silence all the airs and madrigals that whisper softness in chambers?",

  "37131": "And do you know how pretty you are, child?",
  "37132": "You are sure of that?",
  "37133": "Why did the five fellows out of the higher line run away for that?",
  "37134": "Was this not indeed a veritable hell, peopled by lost souls, dead and damned beyond all hope?",
  "37135": "Has your chief come down yet?",
  "37136": "Oh, suppose we did, and had to stay out all night?",
  "37137": "A young man?",
  "37138": "Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught?",
  "37139": "Whose prisoner was she?",

  "37141": "Anything more, sir?",
  "37142": "He can't have found a fox trail, can he?",
  "37143": "It looks like it, doesn't it?",
  "37144": "You don't mean to set up for a new character with ME after all these years, I hope?",
  "37145": "Who can have robbed it of the beauty that gladdened it, of the grace and gaiety that charmed it, of the modesty that shed a lustre upon it?",
  "37146": "But you be glad that you 'm going to marry a gentleman?",
  "37147": "And indeed what does the price matter, if the trick be well done?",
  "37148": "Confound you, have you been rummaging round among my clothes, then?",
  "37149": "Is it wrong to see the beauty of the almond blossoms, wrong to taste the scented wind?",
  "37150": "Do you know how long it would take for an express train to reach the moon?",
  "37151": "Will you tell me how long you have loved him?",
  "37152": "It's breakfast you want, is it?",
  "37153": "You saw the ventilator, too?",

  "37157": "So now we are friends again, are we not?",
  "37158": "Will you three months hence be in a situation to perform the journey more at your ease than at present?",
  "37159": "But is that case could I have expected more from him than from my own brother?",
  "37160": "You say that I am safe and sound?",
  "37161": "How can such cases be explained by the theory of hereditary transmission?",
  "37162": "How can one think of him as bad?",
  "37163": "How much might that be?",
  "37164": "Is not 'loves' the truer tense?",

  "37184": "Are you there?",
  "37185": "Why should he?",
  "37186": "Why make all these excuses?",
  "37187": "How do you like us?",

  "37192": "Consoled?",
  "37193": "You don't mind, do you?",
  "37194": "Do you suppose I want to be told where to go?",
  "37195": "Just you and the river, and no one else to pass a word with?",
  "37196": "But did there not exist in the island some animal which might supply the place of the horse, ass, or ox?",
  "37197": "Shall I?",
  "37198": "Did she speak of the man?",
  "37199": "What was to be done?",

  "37203": "I wonder whether you remember what I said to you then?",
  "37204": "Did you never hear that from the young girls where you come from in the west or south?",
  "37205": "The night porter saw nothing, I suppose?",
  "37206": "For who can guess?",
  "37207": "But shan't you then so much as miss her a little?",
  "37208": "And so you think that I ought to answer your indictment as if I were in a court?",
  "37209": "What need they?",
  "37210": "Who?",
  "37211": "Regular people who get you a place?",
  "37212": "Is this a practical joke?",

  "37427": "Well, there wasn't anything else for her to do, was there?",
  "37428": "You hussy, how dare you talk in that way?",
  "37429": "Now, what shall we do?",
  "37430": "Which should it be?",
  "37431": "Would not I have wished, do you think, to have learned all the truth about the matter before I answered him?",

  "37436": "You're sure?",
  "37437": "Prime, isn't it?",
  "37438": "Are we to see profound wisdom in this?",

  "37442": "And what shall I?",
  "37443": "Not so much so?",
  "37444": "You are fond of it?",
  "37445": "May I see it?",
  "37446": "Tell me, do you know what the countess, for whose pardon you are beseeching me, has done?",
  "37447": "Had she not openly avowed her intention of marrying for money if she ever had the chance?",
  "37448": "That the boy may sink and perish?",
  "37449": "Whose there?",
  "37450": "Been there long?",
  "37451": "Which is the way?",
  "37452": "Or his starch'd beard?",
  "37453": "Who knows what may be in store for you yet?",
  "37454": "By this?",
  "37455": "And not long?",
  "37456": "Is that certain?",
  "37457": "Isn't it well drawn?",
  "37458": "Are you asleep?",
  "37459": "Any ideas?",
  "37460": "Have we been deceived by an illusion?",
  "37461": "Was it physical?",
  "37462": "Caution?",
  "37463": "Did not you know that, my dear lord?",
  "37464": "Did not your friend here look like me?",
  "37465": "What are you rattling in there?",
  "37466": "But again, will they tell us that such a nature, placed under favourable circumstances, will not be perfectly good and wise if any ever was?",
  "37467": "Has not one of you a cross?",
  "37468": "What happened to the worthy captain?",
  "37469": "And what does the judge affirm to be the life which is next, and the pleasure which is next?",
  "37470": "Was my uncle stark mad?",
  "37471": "You didn't think it could be so bad?",
  "37472": "You mean she won't mind?",
  "37473": "Or have we found angels in the forms of kings to govern him?",
  "37474": "More in your brains than in your pocket, eh?",
  "37475": "He has come, then, as they told me?",
  "37476": "The only unofficial detective?",
  "37477": "Have you had lunch yet?",
  "37478": "Far from here?",
  "37479": "And what credit can the poor clerk of a procurer have, pray?",
  "37480": "Whither is it carrying me?",
  "37481": "And where are they looking for her?",
  "37482": "Can't you see that I'm as hoarse as a crow?",
  "37483": "But where is your master?",
  "37484": "Who told you this?",
  "37485": "Of what was he thinking?",
  "37486": "Do you think it is too much?",
  "37487": "D'you remember you were rather sniffy about meeting him?",
  "37488": "Is that what you wished to say?",
  "37489": "How much of the ballast of conservatism and of loyalty to tradition is it well to throw overboard in the interest of accelerated motion?",
  "37490": "Shall a similar end be pursued for the ethical purpose of widening the circle of those who shall live and be happy?",
  "37491": "Why have they not seized me?",
  "37492": "When did it happen and what has happened?",
  "37493": "You see?",
  "37494": "How could we like a people who treated us so unjustly?",
  "37495": "When shall the day come when we shall lift our hands?",
  "37496": "Are you then making a thesis?",
  "37497": "Would you like me to bring some rice?",
  "37498": "Who do you want?",
  "37499": "How did he get 'em?",
  "37500": "You wouldn't leave him lying maimed at the bottom of this dreadful place, a moment, if you could bring help to him?",
  "37501": "And is my life to be forfeit, is some terrible punishment to come on my poor old head for that which I cannot help?",
  "37502": "You will be frank with me?",
  "37503": "And was that the head and front of his offending?",
  "37504": "And must he not be represented as such?",
  "37505": "Yes, don't you wish you knew what that card was?",
  "37506": "But what's he doing here?",
  "37507": "He said nothing more?",
  "37508": "And even if he has done wrong, how do I know that he has not condemned himself?",
  "37509": "And do they give you frogs to eat, so's to make you limber?",
  "37510": "A doctor?",
  "37511": "What did you do?",
  "37512": "Would he allow imitation to be the ruling principle of his life, as if he had nothing higher in him?",
  "37513": "Wasn't it rather sudden?",
  "37514": "That's what you tell this gentleman too, is it?",
  "37515": "He's your husband, eh?",
  "37516": "Can I spare him?",
  "37517": "What now?",
  "37518": "Armed?",
  "37519": "Or may not all three be properly allotted to it?",
  "37520": "Anything up?",
  "37521": "Is that so?",
  "37522": "You do not wish to hear it, perhaps?",
  "37523": "What does it matter to me?",
  "37524": "And will not a true astronomer have the same feeling when he looks at the movements of the stars?",
  "37525": "Why, what else are they?",
  "37526": "And s'pose he steps in here any minute, and sings out my name before I can throw him a wink to keep quiet?",
  "37527": "And the just is the good?",
  "37528": "How have I deviated from those principles, monsieur?",
  "37529": "But why FOUR pounds?",
  "37530": "And what did you find?",
  "37531": "What has he come here for?",
  "37532": "Are you inside?",
  "37533": "Downright?",
  "37534": "Do you think she'll miss you?",
  "37535": "Speak I sooth, my masters?",
  "37536": "Why was it necessary to weave the queen into this gloomy web of guilt and crime?",
  "37537": "I suppose that is why you live in town?",
  "37538": "What was the result of that memorable expedition?",
  "37539": "What, then, is the defence?",
  "37540": "What do you mean by risk?",
  "37541": "What would be the use?",
  "37542": "How could she make such nails work?",
  "37543": "Am I not the wife of my husband?",
  "37544": "What came after?",
  "37545": "What is the proposition?",
  "37546": "So?",
  "37547": "How is the snatchblatch?",
  "37548": "Just?",
  "37549": "Did you hear anything of it when you were in those parts?",
  "37550": "What is in this?",
  "37551": "And through what deplorable madness had she thus ruined her life by continual sacrifices?",
  "37552": "Where are the marks of its fangs?",
  "37553": "What d'you say to having something to eat?",
  "37554": "Who was this novice in war with the effrontery of a luminary?",
  "37555": "In my precinct?",
  "37556": "Is she, my lord?",
  "37557": "May this young lady go with us?",
  "37558": "Has no one come to seek her in this land?",
  "37559": "Hadn't we better hear it tomorrow?",
  "37560": "Then you'll be free?",
  "37561": "Monseigneur?",
  "37562": "Is it not sad?",
  "37563": "Can people enchant each other too much, cajole each other too much, charm each other too much?",
  "37564": "Why do they grease the axles of the wheels?",
  "37565": "If there be doubt as to which of our divisions will get our candidate, is there no doubt as to which of your candidates will get your party?",
  "37566": "What did you take me to your mother for?",
  "37567": "And did they ask you to make a speech?",
  "37568": "Don't you see it is hard enough for her already?",
  "37569": "Some such object it was, that induced you to call on me?",
  "37570": "But how about money?",
  "37571": "You here at this hour?",
  "37572": "Well, then, was it this eye or that through which you dropped the beetle?",
  "37573": "What did your excellency say?",
  "37574": "Where are you going, you rascal?",
  "37575": "Do you know, my friends, what that plain, seen from the height we are at, resembles?",
  "37576": "What was the good of bringing him?",
  "37577": "Where was it?",
  "37578": "Would she be decent to him, or would she scold him?",
  "37579": "Which is the best wish to wish him?",
  "37580": "How CAN you say 'I am happier,' and nothing changed?",
  "37581": "Why sadden the poor children, and damp their newly cherished hopes?",
  "37582": "And you feel convinced that you must break with him?",
  "37583": "Alone, where?",
  "37584": "And you saw him frequently?",
  "37585": "Why is she so glad?",
  "37586": "But why do you ask?",
  "37587": "What new treasures lay here for science to unfold?",
  "37588": "What do ye want?",
  "37589": "Rochester?",
  "37590": "What's coming on?",
  "37591": "Are we to wonder, then, if here and there we find in his works an offensive expression?",
  "37592": "Why not cut it?",
  "37593": "What does the letter mean, mother?",
  "37594": "Are we rising into a fiery furnace?",
  "37595": "What substances will you proscribe?",
  "37596": "And what method of surveillance do you employ?",
  "37597": "Oh, well, as it were, what?",
  "37598": "You think so?",
  "37599": "Of how much?",
  "37600": "Hardly remembered me?",
  "37601": "But we could not prevent it, could we?",
  "37602": "You get your percentage out o' the purchase, I suppose?",
  "37603": "Food enough for all?",
  "37604": "Why doesn't she want it now?",
  "37605": "On the other hand, would he not, by remaining to meet a fate almost inevitable, incur the guilt of suicide?",
  "37606": "Has she told you she likes me much?",
  "37607": "Why should I envy them?",
  "37608": "What did he say to you?",
  "37609": "But if he were taken back again he would imagine, and truly imagine, that he was descending?",
  "37610": "My friend, my friend, why thus grieve me?",
  "37611": "How does that strike you?",
  "37612": "Forty pounds?",
  "37613": "You'll have to, then, won't you?",
  "37614": "But I mean another piece?",
  "37615": "Are all voters enlightened?",
  "37616": "And his level, whether higher or lower, could it possibly be the same as hers?",
  "37617": "What makes you so sure?",
  "37618": "What is it in the nature of the oak that causes it to send its root down into the soil and to drink up of its substance?",
  "37619": "What's he going to read?",
  "37620": "Where shall I go?",
  "37621": "What was the primitive tissue?",
  "37622": "How much do you pay a week?",
  "37623": "Why shouldn't I conscientiously?",
  "37624": "And he is named?",
  "37625": "How came you by the knowledge?",
  "37626": "Is it not one part of honesty to be dutiful and grateful to your master, do you think?",
  "37627": "Why not win to freedom?",
  "37628": "Does he?",
  "37629": "And if not in the worst, why is it to follow at all?",
  "37630": "What, pray?",
  "37631": "Wherefore?",
  "37632": "But how have they endeavored to explain these lines of light?",
  "37633": "Shall I be that?",
  "37634": "And what shall we say of such things as religious duties, of cheerfulness, of good manners, of personal cleanliness?",
  "37635": "Or, have you been a bad steward to yourself, and wasted your property in lawsuits and the like?",
  "37636": "Ah, who put it up?",
  "37637": "But light?",
  "37638": "What has opened her eyes?",
  "37639": "Do you want him?",
  "37640": "It's red, ain't it?",
  "37641": "And would you indeed damn your precious soul?",
  "37642": "Well, did you see her safely off?",
  "37643": "But is he engaged to her?",
  "37644": "Why, how are all the folks at home?",
  "37645": "Are these persons, then, so rich and powerful?",
  "37646": "Can it give heat to a dead body?",
  "37647": "Don't you think so?",
  "37648": "Where's the use of looking nice, when no one sees me but those cross midgets, and no one cares whether I'm pretty or not?",
  "37649": "And the king has seen the cardinal?",
  "37650": "Detain him?",
  "37651": "And return to life, if there be such a thing, is the birth of the dead into the world of the living?",
  "37652": "Or do you also hate the duke your husband?",
  "37653": "Do you know who it is from?",
  "37654": "Have you been to the opera?",
  "37655": "Not a word to your loving mother, who was growing older too?",
  "37656": "Would you be at ease, and feel that you had played an open part?",
  "37657": "Has your majesty no other orders to give me?",
  "37658": "But what are you going to do with him, now he is alive?",
  "37659": "And what shall I do when papa and you leave me, and I am by myself?",
  "37660": "Why is he sleeping there?",
  "37661": "Had he not told her, yes, told her to make a list, and not to admit anyone who was not on that list?",
  "37662": "Were her fears realized?",
  "37663": "I suppose it bowled the poor blighter over absolutely?",
  "37664": "Who introduced this innovation?",
  "37665": "You are perhaps a tulip fancier?",
  "37666": "May I go in and look?",
  "37667": "When will we be married?",
  "37668": "You're in the habit of shaking hands?",
  "37669": "And which is wise and which is foolish?",
  "37670": "But then he had the woman he loved still remaining?",
  "37671": "Shall I then?",
  "37672": "All ready forward?",
  "37673": "Is there any one here?",
  "37674": "But can such a head be found?",
  "37675": "And ten?",
  "37676": "Do you think if I drink water it would take off this hiccup?",
  "37677": "And this one opposite, who is this?",
  "37678": "Neither may they imitate smiths or other artificers, or oarsmen, or boatswains, or the like?",
  "37679": "You'll be ready this day week, will you?",
  "37680": "What was become of them?",
  "37681": "Shall we gather strength but irresolution and inaction?",
  "37682": "And what was in the sealed iron chest?",
  "37683": "Shall I put a little more tea in the pot afore I go, ma'am?",
  "37684": "And what can you conceive more deadly?",
  "37685": "Why did you do it?",
  "37686": "What does she want?",
  "37687": "How do you know about it, and who are you, anyhow?",
  "37688": "What next?",
  "37689": "Deserted?",
  "37690": "When did you get in?",
  "37691": "Will it hit us?",
  "37692": "Do you want to be doing the same?",
  "37693": "Who will bring us bread?",
  "37694": "My friend, what do you tell me?",
  "37695": "Their whistle?",
  "37696": "Where in the world did you get that song?",
  "37697": "Is he very clever?",
  "37698": "Fine stepper, wasn't she?",
  "37699": "Who did I get the statues from?",
  "37700": "Will you have some whiskey and water?",
  "37701": "What news?",
  "37702": "And am I not a hundred times better thus?",
  "37703": "Struck me?",
  "37704": "And you are up?",
  "37705": "What point?",
  "37706": "Don't you know me?",
  "37707": "What is the use of one horse for us two?",
  "37708": "The cardinal was your protector?",
  "37709": "Isn't it splendid to be that kind, teacher?",
  "37710": "Are the other camels better or worse than that?",
  "37711": "Isn't what they have done already enough?",
  "37712": "What two lines?",
  "37713": "At twenty minutes to nine?",
  "37714": "Whom have I to love?",
  "37715": "And the rocks with their various strata?",
  "37716": "Did I not say right?",
  "37717": "What could he, an old man, do?",
  "37718": "And now what does he do?",
  "37719": "Is he so?",
  "37720": "And would it not be the height of absurdity to call such a man fickle and inconsistent, because he had repeatedly altered his judgment?",
  "37721": "Can't you comprehend that an affection may be genuine as felt by the man, yet its nature be spurious in relation to others?",
  "37722": "Then, at all events, he DID sleep here, did he?",
  "37723": "My name?",
  "37724": "And why should I not?",
  "37725": "How could I escape from this situation?",
  "37726": "Don't you know what it means to me?",
  "37727": "Which was the more important, which the less important part?",
  "37728": "You call them that, too?",
  "37729": "But by what means?",
  "37730": "Not come yet?",
  "37731": "Ever hear of lones the packer, hey, ole chappie?",
  "37732": "Is it quite original?",
  "37733": "Did he do that?",
  "37734": "Why should he trust himself to a balloon, that would blaze up like a piece of paper?",
  "37735": "Now, an't it?",
  "37736": "And don't I suppose his was the first face she saw, as she passed through the storm and the night to that waiting, beautiful place?",
  "37737": "You saw it?",
  "37738": "Like him?",
  "37739": "Would you take a seat, sir?",
  "37740": "And yet what else am I to do?",
  "37741": "Well, have you heard from your husband lately, my dear?",
  "37742": "You refused him?",
  "37743": "How did you know that?",
  "37744": "Can she make your real flecky paste, as melts in your mouth, and lies all up like a puff?",
  "37745": "Whence comes this?",
  "37746": "Yes, what is it?",
  "37747": "Should he stay at home with her, her mother and her sisters?",
  "37748": "What can I do to prevent it?",
  "37749": "Have been brought together, eh?",
  "37750": "Would you like to come up and see her?",
  "37751": "What would you like to do tomorrow?",
  "37752": "Will that arrangement suit you?",
  "37753": "And you shall be included in it, in our happiness, do you hear, father?",
  "37754": "FLOATED?",
  "37755": "Have you eaten anything?",
  "37756": "How d'you know I want to travel?",
  "37757": "Did she feel as he did?",
  "37758": "Water to drink?",
  "37759": "You will not serve me, sir, will you?",
  "37760": "How should he be?",
  "37761": "Again, has he greater experience of the pleasures of honour, or the lover of honour of the pleasures of wisdom?",
  "37762": "Is it nothing to hold one's peace?",
  "37763": "And you can do nothing until then?",
  "37764": "When, where?",
  "37765": "Is there generally?",
  "37766": "Yes, but still all this has to be looked after, and who is there to look after it?",
  "37767": "You a chief, eh?",
  "37768": "How much will you give me for it?",
  "37769": "What have I to say to them?",
  "37770": "Now what do you think on't, neighbour, my friend?",
  "37771": "When are you coming back?",
  "37772": "Can anyone be surprised if one gets fond of such a ship?",
  "37773": "Oh, not her?",
  "37774": "But what is worship?",
  "37775": "Why do you not speak to me?",
  "37776": "In arms against me?",
  "37777": "Do you wish for a proof?",
  "37778": "I can't say more than that, can I?",
  "37779": "Where, then?",
  "37780": "Prove?",
  "37781": "Little woman?",
  "37782": "Shall it be said, good reader?",
  "37783": "Are you glad to leave us, dear?",
  "37784": "What had that harsh tyrant of hers done that was good or serviceable for her?",
  "37785": "And the mistress?",
  "37786": "Can one be well while suffering morally?",
  "37787": "Where would be that thrill if I had been as definite as a timetable?",
  "37788": "How long otherwise?",
  "37789": "Tony, where are you going, my charmer?",
  "37790": "What does this tell us?",
  "37791": "How does she use you?",
  "37792": "Have you nothing else to ask him, sir?",
  "37793": "In the nick of time?",
  "37794": "How?",
  "37795": "Mind it?",
  "37796": "How can I help myself?",
  "37797": "Where has he gone?",
  "37798": "That visit not succeeding either, you will go again perhaps?",
  "37799": "Husband, are you as kind and gentle toward your wife as you should be?",
  "37800": "For what is death?",
  "37801": "If I see, clearly see, that ladder leading from plant to man, why should I suppose it breaks off at me and does not go farther and farther?",
  "37802": "Lively?",
  "37803": "Another glass?",
  "37804": "But the great point is, is there a 'Rita' on the list?",
  "37805": "Don't you hear?",
  "37806": "What was the difference whether the alms were given into my hands or into my wife's?",
  "37807": "Do you tell me that the woman is dead?",
  "37808": "Did he take that medicine, men?",
  "37809": "Who would suppose it?",
  "37810": "When was that done which settled the matter?",
  "37811": "What did you say, sir?",
  "37812": "Well and what am I to do now?",
  "37813": "I couldn't do anything better for her than advise her to accept these proposals, could I?",
  "37814": "What would be the result of a total extraction of the nitrogen?",
  "37815": "Do you not suspect?",
  "37816": "Did it keep you awake?",
  "37817": "Did he think that pride or masterful will or physical strength would help him?",
  "37818": "Need any help, officer?",
  "37819": "What's the row now?",
  "37820": "Why are you so bad?",
  "37821": "She never spoke to a soul?",
  "37822": "DO you think race corresponds with nationality?",
  "37823": "Could I ever have believed then that I could come to such humiliation?",
  "37824": "Do you belong to the nobility?",
  "37825": "D'you think they care for us?",
  "37826": "You bring me great news, then, monsieur?",
  "37827": "Did I say above, or seem to imply, that the judge sometimes spoke harshly to his wife?",
  "37828": "Not in health?",
  "37829": "And we have admitted that justice is the excellence of the soul, and injustice the defect of the soul?",
  "37830": "Did you really?",
  "37831": "What was he doing?",
  "37832": "Didn't you know the difference yourself?",
  "37833": "Is he out of his senses?",
  "37834": "Who then?",
  "37835": "Why do I feel so inclined to tease him?",
  "37836": "What monstrous place is this?",
  "37837": "Why can't you leave me alone?",
  "37838": "Where is the use of our reckoning?",
  "37839": "Why isn't it your business?",
  "37840": "Then you don't wish me to, dearest?",
  "37841": "You are AFRAID of it?",
  "37842": "Don't they come after it any more?",
  "37843": "Where is the prisoner?",
  "37844": "Is he generally liked?",

  "37867": "But how can we gain your freedom?",
  "37868": "Or is this a subject in which new discoveries can be made?",
  "37869": "Or haven't you pluck enough to go on?",
  "37870": "Has he got to be harnessed up and driven through life like a horse?",

  "37961": "What's one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one?",
  "37962": "But the question again recurs, upon what pretense could he be put in possession of a force of that magnitude in time of peace?",
  "37963": "What can I do for the son?",

  "37978": "Why did he not tell it?",
  "37979": "What was the reply?",
  "37980": "Did business men commonly go into an expenditure of money which could be of no account to them?",
  "37981": "And then, in the next place, was it probable that the dean would act upon such a letter by filling up the vacancy, even if he did get it?",
  "37982": "And if not, WHO IS IN THE ROOM besides you and me?",
  "37983": "You don't regret?",
  "37984": "What did you stay talking to him for, if you didn't want un?",
  "37985": "Must it of necessity be admitted that this power is infringed, so long as a part of the old articles remain?",

  "37989": "But what can we expect from a turnip?",
  "37990": "And what am I now?",
  "37991": "A widow, ma'am?",
  "37992": "Well, what happened when you did get there?",
  "37993": "You say two faces were familiar to you?",
  "37994": "You opened the letter?",
  "37995": "But what are all these birds doing in heaven?",
  "37996": "For your own credit and for the sake of money, of course?",
  "37997": "Is this, also, some enchanted person?",
  "37998": "But what was it?",
  "37999": "I mean to say, what?",
  "38000": "Ha, friend?",
  "38001": "And what about his wife and family?",
  "38002": "Is it necessary that a bourgeoisie which stands in such need of you should disown you?",
  "38003": "Suppose he were taken prisoner again?",
  "38004": "Now, my good fellow, how are you?",
  "38005": "She was about to say?",
  "38006": "Do you have a teaching?",
  "38007": "Has labor, once so fecund, likewise become sterile?",
  "38008": "Then what do you talk of?",
  "38009": "A signal for others?",
  "38010": "Who, and what are you?",
  "38011": "What then is that which is able to conduct a man?",
  "38012": "Well, what are these buildings?",
  "38013": "What does he want to go out for again?",
  "38014": "You know that great pause that comes upon things before the dusk?",
  "38015": "You wish me, then, to relate the history of my past sorrows?",
  "38016": "What the charm that floats the bowl?",
  "38017": "When did that happen?",
  "38018": "Are you sure they can be relied on?",
  "38019": "What will come of it all?",
  "38020": "Was there any mention made of my uncle or me?",
  "38021": "In what does it consist?",
  "38022": "Then I am not to be allowed to have anything to do with it officially?",
  "38023": "Can I go, can I go?",
  "38024": "You won't mind my working in your room this afternoon, will you?",
  "38025": "Is she a friend of yours?",
  "38026": "Or will you be my friend, as you have been hitherto, and do what I request?",
  "38027": "Do you mean it?",
  "38028": "What is that queer concern going down the river?",
  "38029": "Are you sure he can't get away?",
  "38030": "Was that all she said I said?",
  "38031": "But how cast off all the superfluous, devilish burden of my outer man?",
  "38032": "Why then is that rather a misfortune than this a good fortune?",
  "38033": "There now, what is it?",
  "38034": "Anything in the gruff and grumble way?",
  "38035": "Don't natur herself kinder cry out on 'em?",
  "38036": "Oh, my father, must your past career always interfere with my successes?",
  "38037": "Have I furnished it nicely?",
  "38038": "Then why aren't you quiet?",
  "38039": "What am I doing here, anyway?",
  "38040": "From what causes do I derive my existence, and to what condition shall I return?",
  "38041": "Who put that paper there?",
  "38042": "Will you tell me what you're going to do with the skin?",
  "38043": "What will you do, then?",
  "38044": "What sort of a life could we build on such foundations?",
  "38045": "Ay, said I, but who can help constitution?",
  "38046": "Not chilled, pet, are you?",
  "38047": "Gone?",
  "38048": "Where had you seen me before?",
  "38049": "And if she won't tell?",
  "38050": "And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a fait accompli?",
  "38051": "And to sign the contract in three days?",
  "38052": "Could it be that the unfortunate man had committed suicide, overcome by his troubles?",
  "38053": "And that is your opinion?",
  "38054": "Can one?",
  "38055": "Was it wonderful that I was misanthropic and sullen?",
  "38056": "Who compels me to this?",
  "38057": "And how isn't that nowt comed in fro' th' field, be this time?",
  "38058": "What had she done?",
  "38059": "Do you love him?",
  "38060": "Not even by lightening it, as they lighten an overloaded vessel?",
  "38061": "Is there any other witness?",
  "38062": "Meg, shall we ever learn to talk less?",
  "38063": "What then, when that's once done?",
  "38064": "Then why did you come here, my dear?",
  "38065": "Why should my courtesie to these knights go all for naught?",
  "38066": "Was I, then, a monster, a blot upon the earth, from which all men fled and whom all men disowned?",
  "38067": "Could the latter for a moment suppose that the son would not offer the best part to the father?",
  "38068": "Why should she be sorry?",
  "38069": "And so?",
  "38070": "Seek introductions, draw petitions up?",
  "38071": "How do we know what is at the bottom of his sudden interest in you?",
  "38072": "Wherefore?",
  "38073": "How do you account for this?",
  "38074": "And on what occasions have such favors been bestowed upon you?",
  "38075": "Do you think that will be really necessary?",
  "38076": "Any other letters?",
  "38077": "And where the prudence now that awed mankind?",
  "38078": "What will the ladies take for breakfast?",
  "38079": "Where did you learn how I speak of others?",
  "38080": "Does it hurt you so much?",
  "38081": "You are not angry with me?",
  "38082": "What if her interest in him were not so entirely that of a relative as it had formerly been?",
  "38083": "Did you see them off, before you came away?",
  "38084": "How is he my master?",
  "38085": "What on earth are we to do with him?",
  "38086": "Should you like to sleep?",
  "38087": "Why, it may be asked, has the supposed creative force produced bats and no other mammals on remote islands?",
  "38088": "Should he not have a regard for his health and efficiency?",
  "38089": "Shall I tell you each ornament of your toilet?",
  "38090": "How does he get it, then?",
  "38091": "Can it be believed that they would thus act to no purpose during their courtship?",
  "38092": "How know you this man has?",
  "38093": "What has not fired her bosom or her brain?",
  "38094": "You aren't angry, are you?",
  "38095": "From whence, I ask, could he gain that knowledge, but from the study of the true theology?",
  "38096": "Was there ever such a sober, sentimental interview?",
  "38097": "And as it is to so go at all events, may we not agree that the sooner the better?",
  "38098": "Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?",
  "38099": "And why were you not willing?",
  "38100": "Are you so and so?",
  "38101": "Come, now, tell me, you want me very much to stay, don't you?",
  "38102": "Have you forgotten that I ordered you to remain in bed when I saw you the other day?",
  "38103": "May I suppose that you have this distinction of the visible and intelligible fixed in your mind?",
  "38104": "What's the good of getting away?",
  "38105": "Is it not adherence to the old and tried, against the new and untried?",
  "38106": "What can I do?",
  "38107": "Are or are not our interests conflicting?",
  "38108": "And by whom were they recommended to you?",
  "38109": "Paid according to the labor that they had performed, of what could they complain?",
  "38110": "What would his guards think if they heard him shout like a madman?",
  "38111": "How about the lion and the lioness?",
  "38112": "Don't you see her?",
  "38113": "Had they been heard?",
  "38114": "You are pleased it is a girl?",
  "38115": "Why should not schools be established, a comfortable hotel be erected, a church be built?",
  "38116": "What the devil is the meaning of all this?",
  "38117": "I suppose your people will be here to meet you?",
  "38118": "What could hinder the poor canoe, followed by sea and watched from the shore, from succumbing before the end of the day?",
  "38119": "Aren't you going with him?",
  "38120": "The lord of the soil has all wefts and strays here, has he not?",
  "38121": "When will he be able to be moved?",
  "38122": "What is the matter, then?",
  "38123": "Then this child is not yours?",
  "38124": "What is to be done, then?",
  "38125": "Are you on public, or private business?",
  "38126": "But why did you change your purpose?",
  "38127": "Incense?",
  "38128": "Don't you want some candy?",
  "38129": "That so?",
  "38130": "That one?",
  "38131": "Was there an accident?",
  "38132": "May it be?",
  "38133": "Did I not see you trying to tear off another piece?",
  "38134": "Have you a name, then?",
  "38135": "You're not getting into a state, are you?",
  "38136": "That's the boy, is it?",
  "38137": "But did you ever like knocking about in such discomfort?",
  "38138": "Where was it to come from?",
  "38139": "How did he manage it?",
  "38140": "Now then, what is it, my young woman?",
  "38141": "What can we do for you?",
  "38142": "What commission is this you give me, and what do you charge me to tell his majesty, monsieur?",
  "38143": "It's capital for us here, but what of him?",
  "38144": "Where, where?",
  "38145": "Why are you not so now?",
  "38146": "I should?",
  "38147": "What does it matter where my body happens to be?",
  "38148": "Why didn't you learn?",
  "38149": "Are not you bruised, and cut over your chest and shoulders?",
  "38150": "Ask we what makes one keep, and one bestow?",
  "38151": "What song?",
  "38152": "But why so?",
  "38153": "How did you find out that?",
  "38154": "Are you sure she's married?",
  "38155": "So why should I not stay at his house?",
  "38156": "Will we play our part well?",
  "38157": "Can you not see the hint there is in the practice to such as go searching for secrets?",
  "38158": "You truly wish me to go?",
  "38159": "But then you yourself are known to others?",
  "38160": "Is there anything else you wouldn't wish me to do?",
  "38161": "And who thus advised you?",
  "38162": "Well, have you any news?",
  "38163": "Drunk or mad?",
  "38164": "Can you not use your eyes?",
  "38165": "Don't you know anyone in the house who'll give you a shakedown?",
  "38166": "Where, then, shall I look?",
  "38167": "Is it not marvelous?",
  "38168": "Is it best for you to injure your prospects for such a voluptuous, idle woman as that?",
  "38169": "But will it not be more honourable for you to begin?",
  "38170": "But what's the good of them?",
  "38171": "How was he to rouse her?",
  "38172": "Can I bring the dead to life again?",
  "38173": "Am I quite mistaken, or have we returned to the surface of the earth?",
  "38174": "What does he keep reading philosophy of some sort for all this year?",
  "38175": "How's one to rent it nowadays?",
  "38176": "But which system shall be adopted?",
  "38177": "May I ask what that was?",
  "38178": "Exile yourself, did you say?",
  "38179": "What the devil does he want with me?",
  "38180": "And did you not remonstrate against such infamy?",
  "38181": "Does she remind your highness of any one?",
  "38182": "Who, then, are you?",
  "38183": "And is this his mark?",
  "38184": "Can't she?",
  "38185": "Didn't she say that?",
  "38186": "My wife?",
  "38187": "What was the aim of that visit?",
  "38188": "When did you come?",
  "38189": "Where is your fellow?",
  "38190": "Isn't the wind nice?",
  "38191": "You did not like it, papa?",
  "38192": "Will you marry a wife with money?",
  "38193": "Jugwater?",
  "38194": "How you know dat?",
  "38195": "Are you sorry for our agreement?",
  "38196": "Is that the only comment you can find to make?",
  "38197": "What do you mean by so much the worse?",
  "38198": "Why, doctor, can you light up such darkness as this?",
  "38199": "Salvation of what?",
  "38200": "Shall I speak to him?",
  "38201": "Where would he make himself a prisoner and how?",
  "38202": "Did ever anybody hear the like ?",
  "38203": "Don't you love to be in this place?",
  "38204": "How did it come about?",
  "38205": "But who done it?",
  "38206": "What can you expect?",
  "38207": "Have you recognised him, monsieur?",
  "38208": "Must one then curse immediately, when one doth not love?",
  "38209": "And why is that?",
  "38210": "What of the hunting, hunter bold?",
  "38211": "Shall I do wrong because I am unhappy?",
  "38212": "Did you come here merely to refer me to the lawyers?",
  "38213": "Who's equal to the place?",
  "38214": "What is this, my dear?",
  "38215": "Was it not foolish?",
  "38216": "Must not the murmurs and doubts which these cause reach his ear?",
  "38217": "What are you doing, fellow?",
  "38218": "Do you know what your wife wants?",
  "38219": "Why aren't I enough?",
  "38220": "If she be not fair to me, what care I how fair she be?",
  "38221": "And will you not torment me any more?",
  "38222": "You killed him?",
  "38223": "Will any he in all the land maintain there can be two, not of one blood and birth, so marvellously twinned?",
  "38224": "Did you not hesitate for shame to mount the cart?",
  "38225": "But then, what about the other?",
  "38226": "What do you say, my dear?",
  "38227": "Where are your free and compulsory schools?",
  "38228": "And come every single day?",
  "38229": "Will you go up with me?",
  "38230": "Won't you have something to eat?",
  "38231": "What, then, took place?",
  "38232": "He was very poor, I suppose?",
  "38233": "For no other reason than that?",
  "38234": "Then you have been both?",
  "38235": "Could they live here?",
  "38236": "And what is there left to desire beyond it?",
  "38237": "What do you want me to say to you?",
  "38238": "Is the pain better now?",

  "39132": "How long was it before you went to bed?",
  "39133": "Oh, you in front, what is blocking the way?",
  "39134": "He started by and by as if he were just then awakened, and asked who that was, and what was the matter?",
  "39135": "What are all the records of history, but narratives of successive villanies, of treasons and usurpations, massacres and wars?",
  "39136": "But how, sir, shall we dispose of you?",

  "39179": "Pray, are you aware that the king has no money in his treasury?",
  "39180": "I, indeed?",
  "39181": "Gedge?",
  "39182": "What things?",
  "39183": "Is the king dead?",

  "39330": "But why?",
  "39331": "How can such a person be the master of things?",
  "39332": "Ah, go away, dummy, how about the girls?",

  "41149": "A spy?",
  "41150": "What are you worrying for, so long as he has money?",
  "41151": "Why did you ask me?",
  "41152": "What did these sealed mysterious letters bring him?",
  "41153": "How long will it take you to make up your mind?",
  "41154": "How of the window?",
  "41155": "And what did she for you?",

  "41169": "What was his name?",
  "41170": "Ferguson?",
  "41171": "Can it be that he was ashamed of me?",
  "41172": "Is it true, mother?",
  "41173": "Whither?",
  "41174": "But you prefer playing other people's accompaniments, to singing yourself, don't you?",
  "41175": "Shall I open the secretary?",
  "41176": "In what respect, madame?",
  "41177": "But what is an energumen?",
  "41178": "Who is it bids me hold?",
  "41179": "May I ask where you have taken up your quarters?",

  "41190": "At such a tender age could he have been conscious of his uncle's superiority to all those who surrounded him?",
  "41191": "She had a son, that unhappy woman?",
  "41192": "What was the occasion of this excited assemblage?",
  "41193": "But at a tremendous discount, of course?",
  "41194": "You wish to speak to me about the circumstance which has just happened?",

  "42613": "Do you know, monsieur, of whom you remind me this evening?",
  "42614": "Are you afraid of him?",
  "42615": "Colour of his eyes?",
  "42616": "Would you believe it that there is not a chart on board?",
  "42617": "How much have we in hand?",
  "42618": "Going aboard?",
  "42619": "Are we again on the surface of the globe?",
  "42620": "I may take my turn in talking a little about myself?",
  "42621": "Under what condition is the will of the people delegated to one person?",
  "42622": "What is that to me?",
  "42623": "Why, what can have happened?",
  "42624": "Have I a chance of getting any of it?",
  "42625": "Are they not quickly told and quickly gone?",
  "42626": "It's come back?",
  "42627": "How did they happen to be so little?",
  "42628": "Is he married?",
  "42629": "But must it not be witnessed?",
  "42630": "Besides, have I no confidence in myself?",
  "42631": "What do you call righting yourself?",
  "42632": "Is that well?",
  "42633": "Is that the way to treat my friends?",
  "42634": "Why did you slip away by stealth like this?",
  "42635": "Then somebody does come?",
  "42636": "No international difficulty ever arise to enable us to declare war against some transatlantic power?",
  "42637": "And how shows this recreant conduct in a man on whom unequal laws are known to have fallen heavy?",
  "42638": "What have you got to say for yourself?",
  "42639": "What if I were to put my melons into their greatcoats?",
  "42640": "How the devil do you keep it up?",
  "42641": "One of those attempts which, as you said at the beginning of this conversation, alters the fate of empires?",
  "42642": "How would it suit you to be a night watchman?",
  "42643": "Have you brought a boat?",
  "42644": "What can we do about it?",
  "42645": "Do you believe that all things were created by him, and that all beings are dependent on him?",
  "42646": "How came you to court her?",
  "42647": "Were you never given any sort of an education?",
  "42648": "Then we may form our opinion?",
  "42649": "Ought I not to begin by describing how the change from timocracy to oligarchy arises?",
  "42650": "Are you for it?",
  "42651": "Snagsby?",
  "42652": "How, and why?",
  "42653": "Well, monsieur, do you know who this great lady is?",
  "42654": "Under my clothes?",
  "42655": "Have you no supper, brother?",
  "42656": "Where are we?",
  "42657": "What did she have to say?",
  "42658": "Wherefore?",
  "42659": "Aye, little brother?",
  "42660": "And when are we to start, your excellency?",
  "42661": "Is she sentenced?",
  "42662": "How is mamma?",
  "42663": "You will, eh?",
  "42664": "Do you, too, agree to his giving away the hay you need for your own flocks, giving it away until you haven't enough for yourselves?",
  "42665": "What's going on up there?",
  "42666": "Isn't it so, mamma?",
  "42667": "Rides well, eh?",
  "42668": "I want to know whether ideals are ever fully realised in language?",
  "42669": "And the business?",
  "42670": "What mausoleum were for such a chief A fitting monument?",
  "42671": "Shall we say so?",
  "42672": "O, pshaw, cousin, what's the use?",
  "42673": "One of the condemned?",
  "42674": "Why didn't you say who YOU were?",
  "42675": "Should I stop the service and make a scene in the church?",
  "42676": "I may count on you, may I not, and quickly?",
  "42677": "But tell me, how should this be possible?",
  "42678": "How much may it come to?",
  "42679": "Ye preach patience with what is earthly?",
  "42680": "And you laid the foundation of your fortune in the midst of all those songs?",
  "42681": "Would it be a very hard lesson, dear?",
  "42682": "But how did you become concerned in this villainous affair?",
  "42683": "What do you say to this, mother?",
  "42684": "What is the result?",
  "42685": "Or else?",
  "42686": "But who are your captains?",
  "42687": "You're not going to marry him, do you hear?",
  "42688": "How are you and your swell friend making it?",
  "42689": "Is that how you look at it?",
  "42690": "Seriously, can that be applied to a man of income, who has no other possession under the sun than the market, and in his pocket his money?",
  "42691": "Whereabouts were his former haunts?",
  "42692": "Will you stop smiling in that inscrutable way and tell me what you mean?",
  "42693": "Whose is that letter of your mistress?",
  "42694": "Isn't your wife going to warm your bed for you?",
  "42695": "Is this not purely good?",
  "42696": "Are you trying to frighten me?",
  "42697": "How, could anyone get into his room?",
  "42698": "I like a booby was crying, can you beat it?",
  "42699": "Did you inquire around for HIM when you got loose?",
  "42700": "Are you, sir, the chief of the people who brought me here?",
  "42701": "Nothing?",
  "42702": "Cannot the war be ended at once?",
  "42703": "Will you do me a favor, queen?",
  "42704": "What was that expression you used?",
  "42705": "Was she, then, so clearly in his mind?",
  "42706": "Snobby's a carpenter, ain't it?",
  "42707": "Dern your skin, ain't the company good enough for you?",
  "42708": "What should one love and what hate?",
  "42709": "If it was true, why was it not writ till five days after the proclamation?",
  "42710": "Or because a man is in good health when he receives pay you would not say that the art of payment is medicine?",
  "42711": "Why are you so glum?",
  "42712": "Even among the poor, who would willingly marry the child of a man who had been hanged?",
  "42713": "Who and what are you, and why are you here?",
  "42714": "And he was guilty?",
  "42715": "Gone out?",
  "42716": "A whole scene?",
  "42717": "Did you have any trouble sneaking them away?",
  "42718": "Earth being so good, would heaven seem best?",
  "42719": "And if that be enchantment, as your worship says, was there no other pair in the world for them to take the likeness of?",
  "42720": "What is a kiss?",
  "42721": "My dear girl, what has he done?",
  "42722": "If it should turn out to be all wrong?",
  "42723": "Is there any external evidence to support this grave accusation?",
  "42724": "Tim, you villain, what do you say to that, sir?",
  "42725": "Why give that?",
  "42726": "Did you ever see anything more perfect than her acting?",
  "42727": "And how long will it take you to reach home?",
  "42728": "And we are pursuing the duke with the very horses he has just left?",
  "42729": "Where was there any proof to the contrary?",
  "42730": "Oh, what's that?",
  "42731": "Did you fall from heaven?",
  "42732": "Is it not a greater service to place souls in heaven than to bury bodies in the earth?",
  "42733": "What the devil do you mean?",
  "42734": "Leave any for him?",
  "42735": "Did you notice the face he pulled when he saw that she wasn't here?",
  "42736": "Your second condition for going, if you please, sister?",
  "42737": "Have you gone out of your wits in your office?",
  "42738": "Who is to know who was everybody's father?",
  "42739": "Don't they heat them at all?",
  "42740": "But would any number of men hare dreamed of resorting to such an expedient?",

  "42742": "You know the name I formerly bore, sir?",
  "42743": "Are you satisfied, sir?",
  "42744": "S'pose you're the person we go into camp for, eh?",
  "42745": "A he, is it?",
  "42746": "Whither wanders thy distemper'd mind?",
  "42747": "You surely don't think of mounting a mass like that upon a carriage?",
  "42748": "You don't care to oblige us?",
  "42749": "What was his name?",
  "42750": "How can she write letters to HER, if she's mad?",
  "42751": "You're jealous, is it, of her wedding me?",
  "42752": "Had you no mother?",
  "42753": "And what do you believe?",
  "42754": "My shadow calleth me?",
  "42755": "Not in this place, surely?",
  "42756": "Did not your majesty say so?",
  "42757": "Have I your leave to go, dear?",
  "42758": "But are your beliefs, we should ask, based on historical fact?",
  "42759": "Tell me what?",
  "42760": "Well, wouldn't I rather be the fool I am, than that flea downstairs?",
  "42761": "Glory waits our toil?",
  "42762": "Am I queer?",
  "42763": "So much?",
  "42764": "So that you may be avoided?",
  "42765": "Is it a hoax?",
  "42766": "You might have paid it in there?",
  "42767": "May I congratulate you?",
  "42768": "But what conclusion have they come to?",
  "42769": "What IS the matter with your pap?",
  "42770": "Of it?",
  "42771": "But I may come the next day?",
  "42772": "Why do you bother about humanity?",
  "42773": "Had its direction been altered, either by the influence of the lunar attraction, or by the action of some unknown star?",
  "42774": "Quite free, my lady?",
  "42775": "But why was the ship coming there?",
  "42776": "And is not a similar method to be pursued about the virtues, which are also four in number?",

  "42781": "Where are the shoes?",
  "42782": "Do you not know that it would be better for yourself that you should be married?",
  "42783": "What money is that?",
  "42784": "Did you?",
  "42785": "What sort of a garden is it?",
  "42786": "Now, why do you spend so much of your time before this mirror?",
  "42787": "Shall I call this happy news, or dreadful but profitable?",
  "42788": "Wasn't that exciting?",

  "42817": "She curled her hair and showed her shoulders at him, as much as to say, did ye ever see such jet ringlets and such a complexion?",
  "42818": "What was the noblest life that perished there?",
  "42819": "Isn't it splendid of him?",
  "42820": "Now what shall I do?",
  "42821": "All sorts of mornings are interesting, don't you think?",
  "42822": "Never?",
  "42823": "For example, I said, can the same thing be at rest and in motion at the same time in the same part?",

  "42829": "How far is that hut from here?",
  "42830": "If so, why are there only traces of the assassinated girl?",
  "42831": "You remember that view, with its sharp line of demarcation?",
  "42832": "How long have you been suffering like this?",
  "42833": "How is this precipitation to be explained?",
  "42834": "But what are we to conclude with respect to certain birds in which, for instance, the eyes differ slightly in colour in the two sexes?",
  "42835": "Is it, sir?",
  "42836": "Could I not snap the bond?",
  "42837": "What cheese?",
  "42838": "And our share?",
  "42839": "What more could the spirits want?",

  "42850": "What heavenly particle inspires the clay?",
  "42851": "Is all else bare?",
  "42852": "The question is, how is that object to be attained?",
  "42853": "Or would the sight of it bring recollections calculated to enervate and distress?",
  "42854": "But what is he ferreting for?",
  "42855": "Who dares at my court be a protector of heretics?",
  "42856": "Will we ever get there?",
  "42857": "Is that far, sir?",
  "42858": "Is it thus you perform your charge, monsieur?",
  "42859": "Where I am going to be married?",
  "42860": "But there has been some official investigation?",
  "42861": "Do you not think that they have sent for you, both for the same thing?",
  "42862": "Teeth, you mean?",

  "42870": "Can you really do such wonderful transformations?",
  "42871": "Some new relics?",
  "42872": "At his house?",
  "42873": "Are you very much in love with her?",
  "42874": "Am I not sick?",
  "42875": "Is something the matter?",
  "42876": "What can you do?",
  "42877": "And if the vote be really no infallible talisman for man, why should we expect it to work magical wonders in the hands of woman?",

  "42888": "Will you bet three to one he is not found guilty?",
  "42889": "Were you stopped?",
  "42890": "Had the twenty years of war worn out the blade as it had worn the scabbard, the soul as well as the body?",
  "42891": "What say you?",
  "42892": "And leave the person to whom one gives the thing, you mean, to discover it?",
  "42893": "In what state was the house when you left?",
  "42894": "Would that make the navigation better or worse?",
  "42895": "Can't I talk with you any more?",
  "42896": "Electricity?",
  "42897": "For, in short, if it were not he, who could it be?",
  "42898": "Do you know him, then?",
  "42899": "If all our institutions are based upon an error in calculation, does it not follow that these institutions are so many shams?",
  "42900": "And how are you, my dear boy?",
  "42901": "Oh, what can I say?",
  "42902": "I suppose if at ten they must be either wounded or killed, mustn't they?",
  "42903": "But is the old min agreeable?",
  "42904": "Does the author promise a second part at all?",
  "42905": "What was it we were talking about?",
  "42906": "And who is to pay him?",
  "42907": "Can you stand?",
  "42908": "Shall I assume that we ourselves are able and experienced judges and have before now met with such a person?",
  "42909": "Will you hazard so desperate a step while there is any possibility that any portion of the ills you fly from have no real existence?",
  "42910": "Isn't it rather dangerous, the way you drive?",
  "42911": "MUST a name mean something?",
  "42912": "He did not believe a word of the story, and yet, how discredit or disprove it?",
  "42913": "What will your mother say?",

  "42916": "Mary, do you remember the last time that we were together?",
  "42917": "Was it not you who spoke to me about a certain young man?",
  "42918": "So now, what's to be done?",
  "42919": "But with what shall I reward him?",
  "42920": "Pretty well swelled out, an't he?",
  "42921": "Take it out?",
  "42922": "And how many were there of these linen drapers?",
  "42923": "But will you allow me for one minute to take my supposition for granted?",
  "42924": "How, then?",
  "42925": "And have you not been to bed?",
  "42926": "But what did you do while it was raining?",
  "42927": "And, when the ghost speaks to you, what does he say?",
  "42928": "Pedringano?",
  "42929": "Kept her, on that sweet construction, to be his mistress?",
  "42930": "Shall I knock?",
  "42931": "A barrowful of WHAT?",
  "42932": "Who is so wise as to have perfect knowledge of all things?",

  "42937": "How do you go to work?",
  "42938": "But what has she done?",
  "42939": "A chair?",
  "42940": "Not a first attempt, I take it?",
  "42941": "Go with you, is it?",
  "42942": "Ah, what IS it, now?",
  "42943": "If you're not then, where's your faith?",
  "42944": "Does that suggest anything to you?",
  "42945": "In what?",
  "42946": "Can't ye stay just the same?",
  "42947": "Worked in the yards before?",
  "42948": "Shall I not read now?",

  "42965": "But why did you come, and do this wrong thing, after doing such a right thing as you have done?",
  "42966": "And what do you think about father?",
  "42967": "But what do you expect?",
  "42968": "But why does anybody care about him?",
  "42969": "What do you fear?",
  "42970": "In the first place, you will sup with me, will you not?",
  "42971": "Was he aware, in short, that the entire motions of the terrestrial sphere had undergone a complete modification?",
  "42972": "Wouldn't you have a master for your castle in the air?",
  "42973": "But could anyone possibly eat sixty monks?",
  "42974": "How can I decide?",
  "42975": "Is the king pleased?",
  "42976": "Can you, sir, produce any witnesses to the truth of what you have asserted?",
  "42977": "Did they really?",

  "42984": "What is the secret?",
  "42985": "Are you her daughter?",
  "42986": "What does your mistress call you when she wants you?",
  "42987": "My dear sir, will you allow me to ask you a question?",
  "42988": "What produced this extraordinary occurrence?",
  "42989": "And you ate in your carriage?",
  "42990": "Did not an immortal physicist and interpreter of hieroglyphs write detestable verses?",
  "42991": "Uncle, is it true that we are to go?",

  "44768": "What kind of ice pudding?",
  "44769": "But what the deuce was the name?",
  "44770": "Marchiali?",
  "44771": "Shall I give you the change, my officer?",
  "44772": "What is there of good to be expected?",
  "44773": "And you know, likewise, by what sign the associates may recognize the general?",
  "44774": "What name do you give him first?",
  "44775": "You love no one?",
  "44776": "Where am I to wait for her?",

  "44817": "What is the amount of the angle?",
  "44818": "I've got my wits, what does that mean?",
  "44819": "How can I, if her husband fails in controlling her?",
  "44820": "You are going to live here, are you not?",
  "44821": "Is it?",
  "44822": "Jane?",
  "44823": "It's a corker, ain't it?",
  "44824": "Then you have nothing more to do here?",
  "44825": "What's happening here?",
  "44826": "How dare they laugh at me in your house?",
  "44827": "Have I ever given him any occasion to owe me a grudge?",
  "44828": "Well, what if I am?",
  "44829": "What was it he shouted?",
  "44830": "But for a man, is it manly?",
  "44831": "Not the message?",
  "44832": "Did you get any?",
  "44833": "Not clear?",
  "44834": "Did he fall while you were on him?",

  "44844": "You think then she's secretly wretched?",
  "44845": "What else did he go to school for?",
  "44846": "Which of them is more pointed or terse in his periods, or employs more polished and elegant language?",
  "44847": "Of course you have come back hungry?",
  "44848": "Keggs, there are a number of outside men helping here tonight, aren't there?",
  "44849": "But where did you pass the night?",
  "44850": "For where is the straw that stuffs my body?",
  "44851": "But what can have happened?",
  "44852": "How have things been going?",
  "44853": "How can I tell you?",
  "44854": "Don't you see how it is?",
  "44855": "Why had such a splendid boy, so full of life, to die?",
  "44856": "Where do you live?",
  "44857": "Home here?",
  "44858": "I wonder if they noticed you?",
  "44859": "Is this unity?",
  "44860": "Do you wish to play the braggart with an unarmed man?",
  "44861": "Ought one to fear what the world may say in a case like this?",
  "44862": "Didn't I keer for see 'em blaze?",
  "44863": "If it had been my ears, what should I have done?",
  "44864": "But weren't you fearfully tempted?",
  "44865": "Who was the other?",
  "44866": "It was, then, a part he was playing?",
  "44867": "The duke asked him, if distress had made him so bold, or if he were a rude despiser of good manners?",
  "44868": "Didn't I tell you we would come to an enchanted palace?",
  "44869": "You have used your power, sire, you will not abuse it, will you?",

  "44886": "?????",
  "44887": "And what was this man's name?",
  "44888": "This plan was all very well, but how was it to be put into execution ?",
  "44889": "Should his request be granted, who would you like as his successor?",
  "44890": "What for?",
  "44891": "If a ship had passed near by us what would the sailors have said?",
  "44892": "Anna, why distress yourself and me so?",
  "44893": "You admit attacking the plaintiff?",

  "44908": "Whom shall I announce?",
  "44909": "Said I not rightly that we are a wonderful people?",
  "44910": "To whom is she to be married?",
  "44911": "And are suits decided on any other ground but that a man may neither take what is another's, nor be deprived of what is his own?",
  "44912": "How did you bear your disappointment?",
  "44913": "And you have learned nothing from any other quarter?",
  "44914": "But in what consists this preference?",
  "44915": "And the prince was pleased with you?",

  "44926": "Well, are you having a pleasant journey?",
  "44927": "Have you no present interest in any of the company who occupy the sofas and chairs before you?",
  "44928": "What is the lowest you will take for him?",
  "44929": "And why expose his own children in the battle?",
  "44930": "Look here, young man, are you sure you've no idea where your sister is?",
  "44931": "Are there lights in the windows?",
  "44932": "So you've been here a whole hour?",
  "44933": "How could I live an alien in that house where I had been the child?",
  "44934": "Shall you stay there?",
  "44935": "Who has not heard of the hardest drinker in all the army?",
  "44936": "Wasn't he fed, poor thing?",

  "44938": "And how shall we manage the period between birth and education, which seems to require the greatest care?",
  "44939": "How do you know she has?",
  "44940": "It was running wild after the girls may be?",
  "44941": "He sent some one?",
  "44942": "Who would know so well as you how to teach the lesson of endurance to others?",
  "44943": "Did I not think so?",
  "44944": "By making them stronger for each other's aid, will you make her less willing to discharge a lighter than a greater responsibility?",
  "44945": "What had this condor discovered then?",
  "44946": "But when your father comes back tomorrow what am I to tell him?",
  "44947": "Oh, do you then know him?",
  "44948": "And you think it quite right?",
  "44949": "Then, again, within the city, how will they exchange their productions?",
  "44950": "Believe what?",
  "44951": "Now, my boy, which house is it?",
  "44952": "Perhaps, concerned only for his imminent doom, he had not had sincere sorrow for his sin?",
  "44953": "How can we help?",
  "44954": "How could a man like him be expected to have any pleasure in such a discovery?",
  "44955": "So it was YOUR cry of distress that I heard?",
  "44956": "But do you suppose that if I had been I should have asked you to let me go and live with him?",
  "44957": "Are you coming?",
  "44958": "You think you're better'n your father, now, don't you, because he can't?",
  "44959": "Is it strife?",
  "44960": "What needs he the defence this arm can make?",
  "44961": "Do I understand it?",
  "44962": "What about the general?",
  "44963": "Is this quite just for creditors?",
  "44964": "Your brother was, I believe, unmarried, was he not?",
  "44965": "Why didn't I enter the room?",
  "44966": "What will the archbishop think of that?",
  "44967": "Less pedigree?",
  "44968": "The young fellow whose arms you held, don't you know?",
  "44969": "What was then to be done?",
  "44970": "Why did not you all learn?",
  "44971": "Does it apply well to my suit?",
  "44972": "You mean my mother?",
  "44973": "What does he think I can do with his five francs?",
  "44974": "What lunacy are you talking?",
  "44975": "How could he hope ever to grow up to be as good and wise as they, or even tolerably good and wise?",
  "44976": "Lie down?",
  "44977": "Why not, my love?",
  "44978": "More smart, is it?",

  "44985": "But why are we standing here?",
  "44986": "But who knows, madam, but somebody that shall be nameless would like me best with all my little finery about me?",
  "44987": "How dare you to insinuate that you don't know my character better than your words imply?",
  "44988": "Why had he wasted his time hunting?",
  "44989": "In the hat?",
  "44990": "What is there in your mind?",
  "44991": "You really love, then, no lady at this court?",
  "44992": "Will she be safe over there?",

  "46091": "For not alluding to your leaving us?",
  "46092": "What then must be the result?",
  "46093": "What is all settled?",
  "46094": "Saw you those meteors?",
  "46095": "And what will that good treatment be?",
  "46096": "Well, but is there any war on record which was carried on successfully by him, or aided by his counsels, when he was alive?",
  "46097": "Do you want a map?",

  "46584": "You lodge me in your house, close to yourself like this?",
  "46585": "Do you want me to help you or not?",
  "46586": "But why do you always grip your lips?",
  "46587": "Or that they, who see different and dissimilar parts, should judge differently from each other?",
  "46588": "But why should one take trouble to insist upon the advance of science and art in the medieval city?",
  "46589": "How should I not be?",
  "46590": "Hannah, is that milk?",
  "46591": "Would you rather have it in your room, or will you join us at our table d'hote?",
  "46592": "And what was his name?",
  "46593": "Who could have believed it?",
  "46594": "And you will call on that atheist?",
  "46595": "What cause have I to war at thy decree?",
  "46596": "Why don't you speak, cousin?",
  "46597": "You don't find your fancy kind o' lessening for this chap, do you?",
  "46598": "What need to make a long discourse of what followed?",
  "46599": "And it is?",
  "46600": "Will she not depart as suddenly as she came?",
  "46601": "Can I have also been like that?",
  "46602": "Can you count in your head?",
  "46603": "What was it that had sent him there, he wondered?",
  "46604": "To whom shall I yield me?",
  "46605": "Why, when, knaves?",
  "46606": "Why didn't I fight at sea?",
  "46607": "He was undone, for how could he ask the general for his place again?",
  "46608": "How did you know that I was a prisoner in that tent?",
  "46609": "And why are they bright so long after it is evening here?",
  "46610": "Where is mother?",
  "46611": "Who is?",
  "46612": "Who ran to catch me when I fell, and kissed the place to make it well?",
  "46613": "Do you hear sir?",
  "46614": "Do you know that passage?",
  "46615": "Does he wish to be a bishop?",
  "46616": "What brings you here?",
  "46617": "Can't you sit in by the hearth with the light lit and herself beyond in the room?",
  "46618": "I came, then, to inquire how monsieur had passed the night, and if monsieur intended to keep this apartment?",
  "46619": "Just now?",
  "46620": "And would not the chamberlains have a right to be vexed by it?",
  "46621": "Your majesty has the plan?",
  "46622": "By what right you dared send me those letters?",
  "46623": "Tomorrow?",
  "46624": "Seen her?",
  "46625": "What was that I was saying about denouncing myself?",
  "46626": "Have you got your divorce then?",
  "46627": "Why, what's the matter, trow?",
  "46628": "Monsieur would wish to see my camp, and witness for himself our numbers, and the impossibility of his resisting them with success?",
  "46629": "My friends, do you know what those creatures use for wads?",
  "46630": "Don't you know she has?",
  "46631": "Was it worth while, I asked myself, to invent such rubbish at such a moment?",
  "46632": "Is that long ago?",
  "46633": "Ernest was annoyed and surprised, for had not his father and mother been wanting him to be more religious all his life?",
  "46634": "What do you want?",
  "46635": "Oh, was it right my asking him to dinner?",
  "46636": "Will you cause that to be done for me?",
  "46637": "Was his whole life to be shown up as a useless sham a second time?",
  "46638": "Does that please you?",
  "46639": "Kingsford?",
  "46640": "What prevented it?",
  "46641": "Of what nature are they?",
  "46642": "Were they then so many?",
  "46643": "The solemn song be sung ?",
  "46644": "How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains?",
  "46645": "What's the matter, my dear?",
  "46646": "Where's the little scamp got to?",
  "46647": "All right?",
  "46648": "They don't throw 'em about in church, do they?",
  "46649": "Pardon for whom?",
  "46650": "What does it ALL mean?",
  "46651": "What are those men in those carts?",
  "46652": "Horrid little bird, why did it eat all my starch?",
  "46653": "Surely I was serious enough?",
  "46654": "But above all things, I am a marvel to you?",
  "46655": "Would you like to see them?",
  "46656": "Were you ever up there?",
  "46657": "Was it then that you found her again?",
  "46658": "Of what sort had been the life of the man who had stood for years at the top of a pillar?",
  "46659": "What do you think is the cause of so strange a sound?",
  "46660": "And, as it is our last evening together under quite the same circumstances as during all these weeks, will you agree to a plan of mine?",
  "46661": "Do you know that you have composed some of the most beautiful music in the world?",
  "46662": "Don't you think so?",
  "46663": "Were the distinction or separation of possessions entirely useless, can any one conceive, that it ever should have obtained in society?",
  "46664": "Yet, after all, what is there in it that should surprise us?",
  "46665": "What would you not tell her?",
  "46666": "Not by his daughter?",
  "46667": "Who wants them?",
  "46668": "Ah, why?",
  "46669": "There was a row, was there?",
  "46670": "It's you, is it, who played this trick on me?",
  "46671": "To my sister?",
  "46672": "What do you mean to do for me, old fellow?",
  "46673": "Which way are you walking, my love?",
  "46674": "You have, eh?",
  "46675": "You do not mean to say that I have persecuted her?",
  "46676": "What interest have they in your death?",
  "46677": "Is it you, my dear master?",
  "46678": "What the devil made you stand lingering there, in the wet?",
  "46679": "Oh, that's the name of the song, is it?",
  "46680": "Do you know how to sew?",
  "46681": "What do you mean by locking the door when decent people come to call upon us?",
  "46682": "Was a miner a good miner?",
  "46683": "Biscarrat is a prisoner?",
  "46684": "She is very amiable, then, is she not?",
  "46685": "Do we not wish for an outlet for our surplus population, if I may so express myself?",
  "46686": "Why should she spare others?",
  "46687": "What may that mean now?",
  "46688": "If she looked favorably upon another, do you mean, monsieur?",
  "46689": "How is this strange silence to be accounted for?",
  "46690": "But, putting that aside altogether, what would they live on?",
  "46691": "But how and where?",
  "46692": "Come, will you take me as I am?",
  "46693": "And wherefore?",
  "46694": "What is the matter with me?",
  "46695": "But, pray, when you have been pumped dry one day, what have you got the next?",
  "46696": "Thus, for instance, don't you in the first place want a horse?",
  "46697": "Just a thimbleful of this?",
  "46698": "You'd like to see the room, young man?",
  "46699": "Who knows where the winds will carry this case, and in whose hands it will fall?",
  "46700": "Have we not authorized you to give yourself entirely up to this love?",
  "46701": "What do you say you won't have?",
  "46702": "The vault under the altar?",
  "46703": "Did he voluntarily ignite his own funeral pyre?",
  "46704": "Well, when can you?",
  "46705": "Is it his own, do you think?",
  "46706": "Is it dread of the unknown?",
  "46707": "She has a carriage, then, this niece of the doctor?",
  "46708": "What would you do then?",
  "46709": "And do you think you will marry?",
  "46710": "And are they going farther westward?",
  "46711": "But what says the scout?",
  "46712": "Onny children?",
  "46713": "Was it warm out there, sonny?",
  "46714": "Not do it?",
  "46715": "Will you employ that sword to spill my blood?",
  "46716": "But supposing you did?",
  "46717": "Where did it lead to?",
  "46718": "Where are the street cars and the motors?",
  "46719": "Quarrelled?",
  "46720": "Would you care to take it?",
  "46721": "For one thing, what do we know of you?",
  "46722": "How much did it cost?",
  "46723": "Have you ever had any experience upon the stage?",
  "46724": "On the jury, are you?",
  "46725": "Your excellency knows him?",
  "46726": "We know that the first has been here, but where are the signs of the other?",
  "46727": "How many chloral tabloids did you take?",
  "46728": "And what injury would they do to others?",
  "46729": "Why does it stop there?",
  "46730": "Are you getting about again yet, old fellow?",
  "46731": "Have you any means of transport?",
  "46732": "Why should you put things so bitterly, dearie?",
  "46733": "The millionaire's mite, eh?",
  "46734": "Will you direct me to a lawyer who will aid me?",
  "46735": "Are they real?",
  "46736": "And for what purpose?",
  "46737": "Do you suppose the boat will sail promptly?",
  "46738": "What was its standard?",
  "46739": "Do you remember how silent I was on the drive back?",
  "46740": "Besides, why were they not allowed to escape?",
  "46741": "Were we really there half an hour?",
  "46742": "Does that satisfy you?",
  "46743": "Won't you have something warm to drink?",
  "46744": "Do you see that, my dear?",
  "46745": "The circumstances?",
  "46746": "Would you imagine it?",
  "46747": "O, is't the custom?",
  "46748": "How many had I?",
  "46749": "What does he want me to do, I wonder?",
  "46750": "What, outside our line?",
  "46751": "Is this the way I must return to native dust?",
  "46752": "You think he has run away, do you, sir?",
  "46753": "That he should appear only at that point?",
  "46754": "What are you saying?",
  "46755": "Foolish indeed?",
  "46756": "Quite strong and well, I hope?",
  "46757": "Is his power of speech gone?",
  "46758": "Would he not have done better to have kept the water that he had decomposed in pure loss, in order to sustain him in the air?",
  "46759": "And he might have asked also, where the industry so necessary for such a trade?",
  "46760": "But if I justify it?",
  "46761": "Was he so awfully hot?",
  "46762": "Isn't that your tobacco lying there?",
  "46763": "What is thy name, fellow?",
  "46764": "Where she would be settled?",
  "46765": "Has madame come in yet?",
  "46766": "And which I can have?",
  "46767": "For who would understand the work within him?",
  "46768": "The spider?",
  "46769": "Haven't I told you I won't give them up?",
  "46770": "Where can we be going in such a tiny pool of water?",
  "46771": "Had you heard that?",
  "46772": "But what then, made her so unhappy?",
  "46773": "No brother at all?",
  "46774": "The question I have to ask myself is, shall I marry him?",
  "46775": "Have you been dragging the river all day, gentlemen?",
  "46776": "Perhaps two o'clock will suit you better?",
  "46777": "Anyone in the room could get out?",
  "46778": "A dream?",
  "46779": "And his eminence, the cardinal?",
  "46780": "Did you answer it yourself?",
  "46781": "Put 'em ashore like maroons?",
  "46782": "And what does she come worming herself in here for?",
  "46783": "What comes next?",
  "46784": "This prisoner, who was he?",
  "46785": "Do you recollect me?",
  "46786": "The lieutenant of musketeers?",
  "46787": "And you don't think the patient would object to him?",
  "46788": "You wish to be, according to your tastes or private friendships, free to destroy my plans and save my enemies?",
  "46789": "If I be right in this, how could we make any entirely new improvement by means of tonnage duties?",
  "46790": "Wherein differ the sea and the land, that a miracle upon one is not a miracle upon the other?",
  "46791": "Will you leave that spinning wheel be, you young devils?",
  "46792": "You're wretched, he's wretched, and what good can come of it?",
  "46793": "You have received a regular letter of advice?",
  "46794": "What was that awful noise?",
  "46795": "I asked him where he meant to go?",
  "46796": "And light of foot?",
  "46797": "Do you feel unwell?",
  "46798": "What is a fontis?",
  "46799": "And will not their wives be the best women?",
  "46800": "How, then, did you deduce the telegram?",
  "46801": "Which of them, seeing us together here, will believe that our meeting and dancing at the gipsy party was by chance?",
  "46802": "Why should not my father see him?",
  "46803": "I have heard a party was to leave the encampment this morning for the lake shore?",
  "46804": "What do you call important?",
  "46805": "And, really, what is the result of all this?",
  "46806": "Beg him to come at once, do you hear?",
  "46807": "What do you do in your cottage when it rains like this?",
  "46808": "If so, what we are afraid of, when we but suspect our enemies will inflict it on us, shall we inflict it on ourselves for certain?",
  "46809": "But where are you going really?",
  "46810": "Did not the sun shine upon him with a halo, so that he was bright as an angel?",
  "46811": "No dinner?",
  "46812": "How much does the proprietor increase the utility of his tenant's products?",
  "46813": "You've never worked at anything like this before, have you?",
  "46814": "Did you see us?",
  "46815": "But who could ever repay half the debt we owe you?",
  "46816": "Could he have thrown down the statue after he'd stripped the corpse?",
  "46817": "Shall we say in one hour's time?",
  "46818": "First of all, what did you see?",
  "46819": "Why, where ever did you go?",
  "46820": "You mean the rascals?",
  "46821": "Is it really calling us?",
  "46822": "Do they not think, they will have their own ends, and be truer to themselves, than to them?",
  "46823": "What humour's this?",
  "46824": "How about when you lose?",
  "46825": "But how about the new orbit in which we are moving?",
  "46826": "Shall I lead the way?",
  "46827": "Where was the poor devil to go?",
  "46828": "Would they not willingly sacrifice a little gift in order to obtain everlasting life?",
  "46829": "Where else could he have put it?",
  "46830": "Won't, if he has the chance, turn on me?",
  "46831": "Why are you explaining?",
  "46832": "Why how do you know?",
  "46833": "Well, did he?",
  "46834": "What the deuce have you done with yourself this last month?",
  "46835": "How much have you left of your hundred pistoles, d'Artagnan?",
  "46836": "Why should we load ourselves with a useless burden?",
  "46837": "Had he, beneath the childish face, already recognized the passionate, proud woman?",
  "46838": "What is the reward?",
  "46839": "Why, why, why, are there no harbours of refuge for grown men who have not yet lost them?",
  "46840": "To what good?",
  "46841": "Do you know why I came clear out here afoot?",
  "46842": "Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?",
  "46843": "Is he dead?",
  "46844": "Look here, captain, to speak candidly, do you mean to say that there is anything marvelous in the occurrence?",
  "46845": "What was his purpose?",
  "46846": "There were brave men among them, but of what use was courage when their weapons were powerless against the monster?",
  "46847": "Have you any witness on't?",
  "46848": "Is it a bargain?",
  "46849": "And in the common way of his business does he not expect to be paid for his pictures?",
  "46850": "Who is this youth?",
  "46851": "Not named?",
  "46852": "He hain't been a sittin' so all day, has he?",
  "46853": "And where is your young master?",
  "46854": "How can we truly open the doors, and set free the full genius of our people?",
  "46855": "This what?",
  "46856": "We will go up now, shall we?",
  "46857": "But, it will be asked again, can we on these grounds, admit the existence of a wise and omnipotent author of the world?",
  "46858": "You have taken them away?",
  "46859": "He wondered if she would pity him if she knew?",
  "46860": "Save it?",
  "46861": "To do with you, my lord?",
  "46862": "Our course is barred southward?",
  "46863": "What boots it to deplore?",
  "46864": "How do you manage yours?",
  "46865": "What other dreadful things may happen, who can tell?",
  "46866": "How now, what noise is that?",
  "46867": "What is that house, then?",
  "46868": "Did he cut you out?",
  "46869": "You want to know the crime of which you are accused?",
  "46870": "How could we both be deceived?",
  "46871": "How was her girl to have guarded herself from a love so unfortunate, or have avoided the rock on which her vessel had been shipwrecked?",
  "46872": "Do you notice anything about the arrangement of the lamps?",
  "46873": "Can it establish a maximum?",
  "46874": "You take a roundabout way, then, to inform me that I am very ill?",
  "46875": "Shall I myself really have to say it to him?",
  "46876": "What other case?",
  "46877": "Is there any news of game afoot?",
  "46878": "What does it matter to you?",
  "46879": "Surprised you, didn't I?",
  "46880": "Nice animal for a pleasure party, wasn't it?",
  "46881": "How much is so applied?",
  "46882": "Why do I find it so hard to breathe?",
  "46883": "Ye must tell us more, whether our dear friends at home be of good cheer?",
  "46884": "Did you find poison, or a dagger, that you look so mournful now?",
  "46885": "What do you think of that plan?",
  "46886": "Do you not feel that?",
  "46887": "Besides, are they worse than others, these whom you call savages?",
  "46888": "You believe, then, the attack will be renewed?",
  "46889": "But why should you?",
  "46890": "What was this grand, eternal pageant to which he had yearned from his childhood up, and in which he could never take part?",
  "46891": "Will nothing alter your decision?",
  "46892": "Were you hit?",
  "46893": "Can you tell me anything about the matter?",
  "46894": "Where did you meet him?",
  "46895": "By what constraint doth the high stoop to the low?",
  "46896": "What was it that opened it?",
  "46897": "And what have we to oppose to them?",
  "46898": "I suppose you work till late?",
  "46899": "Murdered?",
  "46900": "Can ye restore to us the beloved dead?",
  "46901": "Shall my silly heart be pined 'Cause I see a woman kind?",
  "46902": "Suppose he never commits the crime?",
  "46903": "So you knew me all the time, from the first moment I came into the room?",
  "46904": "From what, they asked, could his dissatisfaction arise?",
  "46905": "Is this arrangement satisfactory?",
  "46906": "Are you well?",
  "46907": "Couldn't you and I camp out in this house for the night?",
  "46908": "Where are you speaking from?",
  "46909": "What need to say that?",
  "46910": "What eye could penetrate into the tower of darkness?",
  "46911": "Has the ministry resigned?",
  "46912": "Am I not ready speak de too moshe?",
  "46913": "But how shall we gain the bottom of the sea?",
  "46914": "But suppose they come unarmed?",
  "46915": "But what was she doing?",
  "46916": "Was it from the cold?",
  "46917": "You will not, eh?",
  "46918": "Where should we be going, but home?",
  "46919": "Going home?",
  "46920": "But even apart from that?",
  "46921": "He won't, won't he?",
  "46922": "How is it, then?",
  "46923": "It would be terrible if we all yielded to it, wouldn't it?",
  "46924": "Of what consequence was this to them?",
  "46925": "What do they matter to you?",
  "46926": "And the work?",
  "46927": "How can you act this way, dearest?",
  "46928": "What other matters?",
  "46929": "Do you hear?",
  "46930": "How is it that a fatal organization, the organization of humanity, is adventitious, contradictory, full of tumult and catastrophes?",
  "46931": "Shall we not know it?",
  "46932": "What, indeed?",
  "46933": "Guilty?",
  "46934": "What, he had done you the honor to remain here?",
  "46935": "How shall you all fear death if you all know what your friend does not know that he knows?",
  "46936": "Who is that?",
  "46937": "And how long can he rest at the end of his journey?",
  "46938": "You were trying to guess that?",
  "46939": "Cannot you go to the river and drink your fill from the stream?",
  "46940": "Why on earth should two men write a letter in such a fashion?",
  "46941": "Wilfully?",
  "46942": "How long have you been here?",
  "46943": "Or stars and strings?",
  "46944": "An't you?",
  "46945": "Why can't I die now?",
  "46946": "You do not?",
  "46947": "Who could fully describe even five minutes of it?",
  "46948": "You want to take my father FROM me?",
  "46949": "Why should I refuse her whom I bear in heart?",
  "46950": "Who's a child?",
  "46951": "How can I possibly treat these poor fellows, who are of some good, at all events, otherwise than as a councilor of parliament?",
  "46952": "And how about a tour abroad?",
  "46953": "Are you mad, you wretch?",
  "46954": "And what is his rank and proper name?",
  "46955": "But can we expect such a king, or, for that is the material point, can we expect a lineal series of such kings?",
  "46956": "How did you get such a huge huge head?",
  "46957": "Was I resigned?",
  "46958": "And you think if I marry, it will be snub?",
  "46959": "Their complexion?",
  "46960": "I will be?",
  "46961": "A good cause might turn the scale with me, for may not I too be of an exceptional brain, congenitally?",
  "46962": "Is there anything you hold sacred?",
  "46963": "What did you take then at any other?",
  "46964": "Were there many of them?",
  "46965": "How did you escape?",
  "46966": "Will you now comply with my request?",
  "46967": "And the world, you think, would be none the poorer?",
  "46968": "You don't mind admitting that, I suppose?",
  "46969": "Who can tell them where their father is?",
  "46970": "For how is it probable that he would have been tender of his life, when he was so bitter against his memory?",
  "46971": "And why didn't mamma speak to me about him?",
  "46972": "Is it to be some panel of philosophers, some fancied posterity, or some other outside authority?",
  "46973": "Could he not feel that letters, eloquence, philosophy, were all degraded in his degradation?",
  "46974": "Got a cigaroot?",

  "49352": "Some friend of yours, perhaps?",
  "49353": "Did you notice this scratch?",
  "49354": "Shall we speak freely before him?",
  "49355": "Any have they occurred?",
  "49356": "What do they mean to do with me?",

  "49361": "What mechanical agent caused its prodigious speed?",
  "49362": "Do you often go into the country?",
  "49363": "Have you resolved to dishonor me?",
  "49364": "How do you get on?",
  "49365": "But who poured the wine for you that was in this glass?",
  "49366": "But having got there, what was one to do?",
  "49367": "You remember?",
  "49368": "Haven't I been doing it for the past week?",
  "49369": "And do you see the one who has a shield with a gate painted on it, through which a stag appears to be passing out?",
  "49370": "You're come at last, are you?",
  "49371": "Can't breathe on it?",
  "49372": "Where can we find the way thither?",
  "49373": "It didn't affect your appetite?",
  "49374": "Whence but from the body and the lusts of the body?",
  "49375": "You have not exchanged a syllable with one of them?",
  "49376": "Are you wishful to hang me a third time?",
  "49377": "Who is the owner of this house?",
  "49378": "How can you find delight in such society?",
  "49379": "That's ripe old age, isn't it?",
  "49380": "And who is to look after the horses, eh?",
  "49381": "Is it really a fact?",
  "49382": "And how?",
  "49383": "What could be better for the purpose?",
  "49384": "How could I know what I was the bearer of?",
  "49385": "But are you sure you haven't your papers or numbers?",
  "49386": "And that friend is called?",
  "49387": "Who is your servant?",
  "49388": "If she learned the horror of the thing afterwards, what would be your position?",
  "49389": "Why, then, should you think so meanly of him?",
  "49390": "Still, I should like to ascertain how astronomy can be learned in any manner more conducive to that knowledge of which we are speaking?",

  "49393": "Tell me, ye brethren, who will master it for me?",
  "49394": "Yet how have you requited me?",
  "49395": "What are you brooding over so?",
  "49396": "What in the name of all that feels has he to do with BOOKS, when I am dying?",

  "49398": "Before she went into the chair, she asked, with an appearance of concern, what was the matter with me?",
  "49399": "Can't you wait?",
  "49400": "A little spoilt?",
  "49401": "Can't you turn out your tenant and let it to us?",
  "49402": "Did you catch it?",
  "49403": "Supposing the assertion to be really true?",
  "49404": "Money?",
  "49405": "How do you make this forgery when every piece of the evidence is genuine?",
  "49406": "Will you show me the way, for I do not know the street?",
  "49407": "How is enjoyment in this to be explained?",
  "49408": "You will arrest me, then?",
  "49409": "I see that you require someone to answer for me?",
  "49410": "Why didn't somebody come?",
  "49411": "What must be done for it?",
  "49412": "It's strange, isn't it?",
  "49413": "Do you think you can go halfway, and then swing yourself down BEHIND the ladder, so that they will not see you?",
  "49414": "At my expense?",
  "49415": "Do you mean your husband?",
  "49416": "You did?",
  "49417": "Would she think again?",
  "49418": "She is not agreeable, eh?",
  "49419": "Is your sister ill?",
  "49420": "Is there anything that would prevent me from making a good husband to a woman that I loved?",

  "49428": "Did you ever feel a touch of it in your life?",
  "49429": "What are those?",
  "49430": "Can you say it here?",
  "49431": "How are you feeling today?",
  "49432": "Didn't I mention it to you the last time you called over yonder?",
  "49433": "I suppose it is all locked up as I left it?",
  "49434": "Wasn't it lucky?",
  "49435": "How have I been conducting of myself?",
  "49436": "Where are her lover and she living?",
  "49437": "What about marriage and all that?",
  "49438": "How do we know that when you have us in your village you will not kill us all?",
  "49439": "No dowry?",
  "49440": "What used they to be used for?",
  "49441": "How is she?",
  "49442": "Why else should she come here with such a story?",
  "49443": "May I go up?",
  "49444": "What do you know respecting it?",
  "49445": "And supposing it did, what would it matter, since I do not believe in it, and know that it is nothing?",
  "49446": "Not quite intolerable in what?",
  "49447": "Then what did you stay for?",
  "49448": "Does she receive them?",
  "49449": "Might not the balloon before that be emptied of all the fluid it yet retained?",
  "49450": "But did she tell you who it vas?",
  "49451": "I have got no money to send you, but what of that?",
  "49452": "Whither will ye go?",
  "49453": "Ay, but whereabout?",
  "49454": "Can this be you?",
  "49455": "Ah, why were you obliged to cloud this fair, this sublime hour?",
  "49456": "Who had the right to make her life over if she hadn't?",
  "49457": "Don't you love him?",
  "49458": "Do you hear?",
  "49459": "Surely you believe this?",
  "49460": "How long did you reside with him and his sisters after the cousinship was discovered?",
  "49461": "And about me?",
  "49462": "What the devil do you mean, sir?",
  "49463": "What's there to stare at?",
  "49464": "And do you feel sure of succeeding?",
  "49465": "What don't you understand?",
  "49466": "You never heard of anything of that sort?",
  "49467": "Do you want to know what I honestly think of you?",
  "49468": "What shall we gain by it?",
  "49469": "I wonder if water is liable to spoil pumpkins?",
  "49470": "You noticed nothing?",
  "49471": "Is it a mystery?",
  "49472": "Well, what are you the better for this?",
  "49473": "What is it you propose?",
  "49474": "He's keeping quiet then on purpose?",
  "49475": "Has not the time leisure?",
  "49476": "What did the king say to you?",
  "49477": "Whom am I to take with me?",
  "49478": "And well improved opportunity?",
  "49479": "At what result did you arrive?",
  "49480": "If the cultivator ceased to be a tenant, would the land be worse cared for?",
  "49481": "What do you mean by bringing such a creature as that here, sir?",
  "49482": "Who can that be?",
  "49483": "And how did they arrest you, dear lad?",
  "49484": "What in the world can she do against us?",
  "49485": "O good sir, said I, may I be heard one thing?",
  "49486": "Did you get hurt?",
  "49487": "Well, you never can tell what sort of people you're living next to in this town, can you?",
  "49488": "What is life but a scarring?",
  "49489": "What course should he take?",
  "49490": "Or don't you think so?",
  "49491": "You see any of my folks lately?",
  "49492": "And what are you going to do now?",

  "49494": "What should the father have done?",
  "49495": "Do you know, by the way, how much my book is worth?",

  "49505": "Will not a tiny speck very close to our vision blot out the glory of the world, and leave only a margin by which we see the blot?",
  "49506": "Are you tempting me to box your ears for you, or what?",
  "49507": "Are you all ready?",
  "49508": "Which means, I suppose, that you are not quite clear about your case?",
  "49509": "Is that carried?",
  "49510": "That's strange for a sailor, isn't it?",
  "49511": "He asked me what I would have for dinner?",
  "49512": "Is the under side of civilization any less important than the upper side merely because it is deeper and more sombre?",
  "49513": "How are things with you, master?",
  "49514": "Should we cut the deficit more?",
  "49515": "Is it not a good place?",
  "49516": "In what way could it possibly be the interest of the inhabitants of that dwelling to serve me?",
  "49517": "You carry a little pad of paper in your pocket, don't you?",

  "50079": "With what object?",
  "50080": "Or is it the matter?",
  "50081": "Do you wish a step, or some place in the government?",
  "50082": "Of course you know a squint may be induced or cured by surgery?",

  "50085": "Am I right or not?",
  "50086": "Why impossible?",
  "50087": "It is agreed, then, that I carry you off with me?",
  "50088": "You don't think one needs the EXPERIENCE of having been married?",

  "50103": "Had he been scarred by accident or illness?",
  "50104": "What do you talk about?",
  "50105": "Or why should not all the three walk abreast?",
  "50106": "Don't you know how one longs to have something to do for some one who belongs to one?",
  "50107": "And is it so, maidy?",
  "50108": "Were they hungry?",

  "50111": "Do your ears tell you that they have traced our retreat?",
  "50112": "What made you sit in such an awkward position?",
  "50113": "Why shouldn't we both be married, instead of sitting through the long winter evenings by our solitary firesides?",

  "50130": "Do you know where we could get one?",
  "50131": "Well, and you want your fortune told?",
  "50132": "Because I loved and married someone else doesn't alter the fact that I once cared for him, does it?",
  "50133": "Was it his wife, or else as like her as any sister could be?",
  "50134": "Does that mean that all men have a right to all property?",
  "50135": "How could she tell where I had got the handkerchief?",
  "50136": "And can bear to have my morsel of bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my cup?",

  "50138": "Oh, isn't that too bad?",
  "50139": "What troops are these that seem to be passing through the wood?",
  "50140": "You'd never think it to look at me, would you?",
  "50141": "What shall I sing?",
  "50142": "What object could they have?",
  "50143": "And do you suppose she understands nothing?",
  "50144": "Could I have caused that girl's death and procreated this being?",
  "50145": "What do the women find so impressive in that little brat?",
  "50146": "Well, sir?",
  "50147": "And I must cross it with silver, I suppose?",
  "50148": "A letter?",
  "50149": "Whom follow?",
  "50150": "What means this profession of faith?",
  "50151": "His wife?",
  "50152": "What place is that?",
  "50153": "Is not this thing which you advise me to do a little cowardly?",
  "50154": "Who has paid adulation to the nation while claiming for it a sovereignty which it was incapable of exercising?",
  "50155": "Have you not wished to go?",
  "50156": "Died he of sickness or through treachery?",
  "50157": "Isn't this rather sudden?",
  "50158": "To how much?",
  "50159": "Why, why are people all balls of bitter dust?",
  "50160": "You tell me nothing?",
  "50161": "What means this?",
  "50162": "Who calls?",
  "50163": "Why should I deny it?",
  "50164": "What is the matter with them?",
  "50165": "Now, children, which is it to be?",
  "50166": "Is the doctrine warranted by FACTS?",
  "50167": "Then what will you do with me then?",
  "50168": "Can anyone grasp what such an offer meant at such a spot, made to a man who, to tell the truth, is very fond of a smoke after meals?",
  "50169": "From whom had they that information?",
  "50170": "Shall I ever see your sister?",
  "50171": "Then your duchess is still at the waters?",
  "50172": "Have you heard anything of the case?",
  "50173": "Do you wish to try to do so?",
  "50174": "After all, he said in his bitterness, what can a woman care about so much as house and furniture?",
  "50175": "What was his devotion worth to her?",
  "50176": "I suppose I could walk with the rest?",
  "50177": "But why waste more words on them?",
  "50178": "What was it fell last night from the evil moon?",
  "50179": "Well, then, I said, why couldn't she tell her husband to fetch a dog?",
  "50180": "Just as she was, in a manner, pretending to listen?",
  "50181": "Two words?",
  "50182": "It was he who told you to invite me to appear with these studs?",
  "50183": "And how were they treated?",
  "50184": "Do you bring me a message from the king, or have you made a bold hit, and wish me to take you again under my protection?",
  "50185": "Isn't it a terrible thing to die so young as that?",
  "50186": "How many times have we seen it?",
  "50187": "Well, then, what possessed you to go down there this time of night?",
  "50188": "And do you know who is his lieutenant?",
  "50189": "Did not you take heed, quoth he, a little before he opened his mouth to speak, what a shogging, shaking, and wagging his head did keep?",
  "50190": "I suppose that's what your humanity would suggest?",
  "50191": "And are you going away, then, really?",
  "50192": "Do you not know that you have been dead this long time?",
  "50193": "How long a delay do you wish for?",
  "50194": "Well, what will you give for it?",
  "50195": "What evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of your senses?",
  "50196": "But should you not interfere?",
  "50197": "It would trouble me sadly to make him unhappy, for I couldn't fall in love with the dear old fellow merely out of gratitude, could I?",
  "50198": "Where were thy senses?",
  "50199": "Mademoiselle, how could you believe that?",
  "50200": "Do you understand what the word pity means?",
  "50201": "You mean it makes you feel that you have nothing?",
  "50202": "But what about women?",
  "50203": "Besides, how could one land on the opposite bank among willows which would scuttle the boat, and with a flood of unknown extent?",
  "50204": "Have I, indeed, said anything you should answer with such a cruel remark?",
  "50205": "What hinders it?",
  "50206": "Would you care fer any one that took all those?",
  "50207": "You haven't breakfasted?",
  "50208": "So what have you done with it?",
  "50209": "You mean when a woman has children?",
  "50210": "What is there to surprise anyone in that?",
  "50211": "If I only had it here, wretch that I am, what more should we want?",
  "50212": "Well, monseigneur?",
  "50213": "Do you wish me to begin admiring the peoples?",
  "50214": "Do I not myself know that I am at this moment in want of a dozen pages, and that I am sick with cudgelling my brains to find them?",
  "50215": "Which do ye choose?",
  "50216": "Did you observe any one during the first act?",
  "50217": "Have you heard the news?",
  "50218": "And what IS this on my head?",
  "50219": "Why deceive us further?",
  "50220": "And by whom are you forbidden?",
  "50221": "Who has done this?",
  "50222": "And who was that man?",
  "50223": "What happened to you?",
  "50224": "What put her up to clearing out?",
  "50225": "To play blindman's bluff?",
  "50226": "Well, sire?",
  "50227": "Any answer?",
  "50228": "How do you do?",
  "50229": "You wouldn't like your relations to be starved, even if they were only third cousins, would you?",
  "50230": "And so, is it quite certain he is coming?",
  "50231": "What have you discovered?",
  "50232": "If nobody were rich, who would employ the poor?",
  "50233": "And what do you expect the king to reply?",
  "50234": "But if she does?",
  "50235": "Where is he who could say it no?",
  "50236": "I have surely not been dreaming, have I?",
  "50237": "Shall we light a fire, so as to signal our presence on the coast?",
  "50238": "Do you think of dying, my lord?",
  "50239": "What does the poetry or the value of the ring signify?",
  "50240": "What do you believe, what do you KNOW?",
  "50241": "How's my poor brother?",
  "50242": "Is he so hard, then?",
  "50243": "Why did you come?",
  "50244": "Oh, mother, what is the matter?",
  "50245": "And what house is this?",
  "50246": "What, no second club?",
  "50247": "Will fish go down with them?",
  "50248": "May it not, theoretically, include as much of the universe as is known to man?",
  "50249": "Is it my affair?",
  "50250": "I, madame?",
  "50251": "Why should you go about the parish?",
  "50252": "Who is this ancient teacher or who is his prototype if he is an ideal being?",
  "50253": "What could those words mean?",
  "50254": "Did you never do any robbery in your life?",
  "50255": "What devil?",
  "50256": "Why are we less prompt to provide for our own safety than the rest of the citizens?",
  "50257": "I said, do you hear me?",
  "50258": "For what purpose?",
  "50259": "Is his hour past?",
  "50260": "Do you know of any other?",
  "50261": "For how, under different wills, should we find complete unity of ends?",
  "50262": "Did you ever see anything to equal it, as you steam away in the sunset?",
  "50263": "Were you thinking of your birth then?",
  "50264": "Look at a plant in the midst of its range, why does it not double or quadruple its numbers?",
  "50265": "Couldn't he have waited for the good season to increase his chances?",
  "50266": "Am I too heavy?",
  "50267": "Shall we agree to this plan, or not?",
  "50268": "Buy back your wheelbarrow?",
  "50269": "Do they begin by exciting the detestation of the very instruments of their intended usurpations?",
  "50270": "Up so early?",
  "50271": "Do I know you?",
  "50272": "His things and his bag are with him?",
  "50273": "Another shock, eh?",
  "50274": "Can I trust you?",
  "50275": "Other people's?",
  "50276": "And did you see her just now, as she spoke of her father?",
  "50277": "And fought?",
  "50278": "Was there no other who contributed?",
  "50279": "Under what obligation do I lie of making such an abuse of time?",
  "50280": "Could any other man express what they knew so well how to express in tones and in words?",
  "50281": "But what book is that next it?",
  "50282": "It surely cannot be you who made shoes for me at the l'ecole militaire?",
  "50283": "How must I do?",
  "50284": "But how, sir, said I, did you part?",
  "50285": "Where was the first lion?",
  "50286": "When didn't you?",
  "50287": "What is its name?",
  "50288": "That is, you mean that sin keeps him back?",
  "50289": "To whom was this letter addressed?",
  "50290": "Carlo, did I offer any violence?",
  "50291": "Couldn't stand it, eh?",
  "50292": "Who are your uncles and aunts?",
  "50293": "What was he saying yesterday?",
  "50294": "And do you think I ever shall?",
  "50295": "Why do you want me?",
  "50296": "I ask you what year is it?",
  "50297": "What sent you hither?",
  "50298": "Was such a thing ever heard of?",
  "50299": "What had she to do with the justice or injustice of other people?",
  "50300": "Which is it to be, death or life?",
  "50301": "Jule, you won't go, will you?",
  "50302": "How will they proceed?",
  "50303": "Not a cloud?",
  "50304": "What has that boy been about?",
  "50305": "Or any other time?",
  "50306": "Are they not already in the land?",
  "50307": "What did they want there?",
  "50308": "To which?",
  "50309": "The surface of a sphere?",
  "50310": "Are they happy?",
  "50311": "Is it a good road, and how far?",
  "50312": "And the lord chamberlain?",
  "50313": "Mayor?",
  "50314": "Had you ever any reason to complain of him?",
  "50315": "Will you promise me then to be at peace?",
  "50316": "A voyage?",
  "50317": "And they found the child?",
  "50318": "Yet what will the energy of true genius not effect?",
  "50319": "What is there to hinder?",
  "50320": "Is it a lonely farm?",
  "50321": "And can I play with him, too?",
  "50322": "Why do I want to go?",
  "50323": "What business, said she, had you to read my letter?",
  "50324": "Or, if it ought to give any, what are the different parts of education which it ought to attend to in the different orders of the people?",
  "50325": "Why don't he, in such a case, sell his horses, let his house, turn off his servants, and make a thorough reform at once?",
  "50326": "You don't mean to say you have forgotten that you promised to make half a dozen calls with me today?",
  "50327": "What time did he set off for town?",
  "50328": "And are you coming with us?",
  "50329": "When had that question been settled?",
  "50330": "Had he travelled?",
  "50331": "And why have you such an air of sadness aboard?",
  "50332": "Could these girls have been injured by the perusal of novels?",
  "50333": "And what has become of the business?",
  "50334": "Was it an instant of enchantment only or long hours and years and ages?",
  "50335": "Is the lady so very alarming?",
  "50336": "Your marriage?",
  "50337": "Won't you, young fellow?",
  "50338": "Your aunt?",
  "50339": "By means of what organ?",
  "50340": "What DOES the face matter?",
  "50341": "All of it?",
  "50342": "Do you think I show symptoms of yellow fever or cholera, that you are making post mortem arrangements with such zeal?",
  "50343": "Is he lost, I wonder, in this desert?",
  "50344": "Can you enlighten me on that point?",
  "50345": "What makes her want to see ye?",
  "50346": "Do you mean to ask this girl to marry you?",
  "50347": "Are you quite well?",
  "50348": "And what this?",
  "50349": "Did not his land produce sufficient of everything?",
  "50350": "When did it break out?",
  "50351": "Why add up the elements of resistance and anarchy?",
  "50352": "And pray, if you are so good, who ventures to affirm that?",
  "50353": "What for?",
  "50354": "What are you thinking of doing?",
  "50355": "How could we live and where could we live?",
  "50356": "Is it so nice as all that?",
  "50357": "But what do I say?",
  "50358": "Or wasn't it meant for my ears?",
  "50359": "Whom does this belong to?",
  "50360": "Who are you, my good man?",
  "50361": "Do they think the prefect will be glad to dine down there under a tent like a gipsy?",
  "50362": "Had I dreamt?",
  "50363": "Why did she so lose courage?",
  "50364": "And can you not understand why I said fortune favours us?",
  "50365": "What's the use of living?",
  "50366": "Are you well and happy?",
  "50367": "What to do?",
  "50368": "Did the sun, which shone so brightly everywhere else, really fall upon him?",
  "50369": "What brings you here, dear heart?",
  "50370": "What were they now?",
  "50371": "I suppose you haven't got a brass farthing, have you?",
  "50372": "You understand what I say?",
  "50373": "Are they in safety?",
  "50374": "Sneezed, did you?",
  "50375": "I'm not?",
  "50376": "Have you forgotten that a son ought to love and honour his father and mother?",
  "50377": "Had the remembrance of her teaching utterly vanished, and the last trace of her maternal influence quite faded away?",
  "50378": "Don't you know the cawing crow lives five times as long as a man?",
  "50379": "What do you want with me?",
  "50380": "You are staying the whole evening, I hope?",
  "50381": "Why shouldn't she like him?",
  "50382": "What weight would that carry?",
  "50383": "Doesn't she look lovely?",
  "50384": "Good gracious, what noise is that?",
  "50385": "Have you seen the princess?",
  "50386": "Is it because there is no word tender enough to be your name?",
  "50387": "Won't you try and care for me a little?",
  "50388": "So you wanted to get away, my dear, did you?",
  "50389": "Did it not show that he comprehended his relations with her?",
  "50390": "What need of positive law where natural justice is, of itself, a sufficient restraint?",
  "50391": "But how was it settled between you, mamma?",
  "50392": "What means this?",
  "50393": "What is it that is strange?",
  "50394": "Coming in to have a short time?",
  "50395": "Do you reproach me?",
  "50396": "And what do you pick your teeth with, after devouring that fat goose?",
  "50397": "Had not his books taught him that he was a man?",
  "50398": "And will you mention to me the yearly sum which would repay you for managing these affairs which we have discussed together?",
  "50399": "What'll be over?",
  "50400": "But then, what are we here for?",
  "50401": "Why shouldn't I have them all to myself?",
  "50402": "You'll wait and wave your handkerchief when I get to that turn in the road?",
  "50403": "Two years ago, wasn't it?",
  "50404": "Now, what do you think the lawyer making the inquiries wants?",
  "50405": "You have?",
  "50406": "De qui?",
  "50407": "What was it, my dear?",
  "50408": "She was young, you say?",
  "50409": "His effect?",
  "50410": "What is life to you?",
  "50411": "Where are you living now?",
  "50412": "How can I tell whet ye say?",
  "50413": "Have they?",
  "50414": "Shall my messenger, in your name, tell your people to give in?",
  "50415": "And does he still tip you?",
  "50416": "If he forsakes his faith, how doth it profit you?",
  "50417": "Why do you do such a strange thing?",
  "50418": "Why did you think so?",
  "50419": "Does he say so now?",
  "50420": "And both should be in harmony?",
  "50421": "Why, you love him, do you not?",
  "50422": "I hope I am doing nothing wrong in asking it again?",
  "50423": "Had he spoken of himself, of himself as he was or wished to be?",
  "50424": "If he did not, what would she do?",
  "50425": "And ought not the same natures to have the same pursuits?",
  "50426": "What next?",
  "50427": "Won't you come to see mamma?",
  "50428": "Why did it happen?",
  "50429": "But our troop horses?",
  "50430": "Nay, tell me, how many histories are there filled with these marvels?",
  "50431": "It's likely, isn't it, then there would be two girls with a name like that?",
  "50432": "Do you mind my smoking?",
  "50433": "How, then, does this passion for gain, abandoned to itself, turn to the prejudice of society?",
  "50434": "If a kiss had been imprinted?",
  "50435": "Well, do you attend the function tonight?",
  "50436": "Whence the cause of this singular intoxication, the consequences of which might have been very disastrous?",
  "50437": "But they have wisdom, else what is the use of having died?",
  "50438": "Always a muddle?",
  "50439": "Have I given no testimony of my sincerity and of my passion?",
  "50440": "That's everything?",
  "50441": "Is this the same lemonade of which you partook?",
  "50442": "And what does he charge?",
  "50443": "But the horses?",
  "50444": "Is not a debt, while the solvency of the debtor is undoubted, always reckoned as part of the wealth of the creditor?",
  "50445": "In summer?",
  "50446": "And what the devil was the matter with his head?",
  "50447": "Why do we love?",
  "50448": "And what do the rulers call the people?",
  "50449": "And how much was the residue?",
  "50450": "What do you think he replied?",
  "50451": "Or is it equally criminal in every body?",
  "50452": "Perhaps you think I shall abandon you, dear grandpapa, and that I shall forget you when I am married?",
  "50453": "What's coming next?",
  "50454": "Did your father speak of it?",
  "50455": "What was that noise?",
  "50456": "Your father breaks horses, don't he?",
  "50457": "What made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here?",
  "50458": "An old hag who said her son had the plague?",
  "50459": "How then was it closed?",
  "50460": "What is the cause of all this?",
  "50461": "What do I seek on the height?",
  "50462": "Have the enemy called in any foreign help?",
  "50463": "Will you believe that she never said a prayer in her life till tonight?",
  "50464": "Lost her memory, eh?",
  "50465": "And pray who are the persons who exhaust your fortune?",
  "50466": "You did not recognise me?",
  "50467": "How shall I break through them?",
  "50468": "That your own bunk over on that side?",
  "50469": "Is this a fact?",
  "50470": "But where, where was this self, this innermost part, this ultimate part?",
  "50471": "What have I to consider?",
  "50472": "Had she succeeded in extracting the secret, and awakening in that adamant heart a last faint touch of pity?",
  "50473": "And will you transfer me to your brother?",
  "50474": "Indeed formerly you were wont to give us some freely, and will you not now let us have any for our money?",
  "50475": "How did it come about, I wonder, that the elder officers are not here to interfere with anything you do?",
  "50476": "Natasha, what is it about?",
  "50477": "I may turn my back on this town a few hours sooner than I intended, but what of that?",
  "50478": "How are they?",
  "50479": "Divide it by three, and what is the result?",
  "50480": "Would I speak to you if he did?",
  "50481": "Where shall I go to find you?",
  "50482": "And the casks?",
  "50483": "Said I, is there here a new world?",
  "50484": "Hamlet's which?",
  "50485": "And suppose some learned traveller should come across these specimens, eh?",
  "50486": "Dare you pretend to rouse him against me?",
  "50487": "Is it possible that you consider the sea to be greater now than formerly?",
  "50488": "Where are your reindeer?",
  "50489": "Why was it I wanted to tell him and did not tell him?",
  "50490": "Have I not a wife?",
  "50491": "What time are you supposed to return?",
  "50492": "Why, what are these doing, who are bent down so much?",
  "50493": "Five pounds?",
  "50494": "Had they restored the master's gold with the clothes?",
  "50495": "But why do you wish to bind yourself?",
  "50496": "Say, is it possible?",
  "50497": "You've bought our inn?",
  "50498": "If he were not only to sink from his highest resolve, but to sink into the hideous fettering of domestic hate?",
  "50499": "Must one not surrender his right when he is unable to recover it?",
  "50500": "Why are you so careful, so tender, of this one wrong and no other?",
  "50501": "How am I to pay them?",
  "50502": "You hear that?",
  "50503": "I hope you will not object to my remaining at home, sir?",
  "50504": "And you have brought him back here?",
  "50505": "Should he speak to her?",
  "50506": "And the first?",
  "50507": "How can one describe a man?",
  "50508": "Do you know what you look like, all together, as you are armed and guarded by your lackeys?",
  "50509": "Do you believe him to be implicated?",
  "50510": "Now, what are you waiting for?",
  "50511": "Have you got the pipe?",
  "50512": "Is it surprising, that such a tasteless being should rather caress this dog than her children?",
  "50513": "Of how many does it consist?",
  "50514": "How could they learn, how calculate, in the midst of this night?",
  "50515": "Are not the two sexes made for one another?",
  "50516": "Are these bears here?",
  "50517": "No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of mine?",
  "50518": "When will he come?",
  "50519": "What misfortune has happened then?",
  "50520": "Were they TO BE or BORN TO BE?",
  "50521": "We haven't the dust to bother us, as the men have, and whoever heard of a horse stepping on a man?",
  "50522": "And how far from the edge of the wood?",
  "50523": "When you get through working your horses this fall, will you turn them out in the snow?",
  "50524": "If it's all wrong, why does he read them?",
  "50525": "Why, said I, are you afraid I should confederate with them to commit a robbery upon my master?",
  "50526": "This famous invention of yours?",
  "50527": "Don't you want any?",
  "50528": "But what are you shouting for?",
  "50529": "Or what is your name?",
  "50530": "Do you mind him only having two noises?",

  "54503": "May I go now?",
  "54504": "Can't we bide here?",
  "54505": "You don't know the gentlemen here?",
  "54506": "Surely you wouldn't like that?",
  "54507": "To such arguments what could have been answered?",
  "54508": "Haven't I told you o't fifty times?",
  "54509": "Why did I rush upon my fate?",
  "54510": "But in what position are we going to attack him?",
  "54511": "Is he safe?",
  "54512": "What were these villains after but money?",
  "54513": "And pretty?",
  "54514": "How came you here at all?",
  "54515": "Still in the wine trade?",
  "54516": "What is the good of reading, what is the good of learning anything, for just six months?",
  "54517": "What has become of her, then?",
  "54518": "Won't you give me some?",
  "54519": "And you say you can penetrate it?",
  "54520": "If he wants it, where is his nobility?",
  "54521": "And you understand heraldry?",
  "54522": "Where are grace, beauty, and blandishments, like those?",
  "54523": "Wellington?",
  "54524": "You asked, what has driven me to flight at last?",
  "54525": "Did you get blown up?",
  "54526": "Is it against you or against myself?",
  "54527": "When will it take place?",
  "54528": "Will you permit me to be absent for three days?",
  "54529": "What's it all about?",
  "54530": "Surely these tombstones are not all wrong?",
  "54531": "May you tell me whither?",
  "54532": "Oh, is this the boy?",
  "54533": "Ow'm I to know that?",
  "54534": "Isn't that delightfully romantic?",
  "54535": "How many did we crush under the wall?",
  "54536": "When have you ever spoken like that before?",
  "54537": "But you said I might go, father?",
  "54538": "Now what you going to do?",
  "54539": "Would he not come next morning, if he could?",
  "54540": "What does that say?",
  "54541": "How goes it?",
  "54542": "And the florid face?",
  "54543": "And you will not compromise yourself?",
  "54544": "Why it that?",
  "54545": "Ought they to smoke like that?",
  "54546": "Matter?",
  "54547": "Had she seen him again?",
  "54548": "What ails him?",
  "54549": "How did my soul rise again out of those sepulchres?",
  "54550": "And what have you been doing since yesterday?",
  "54551": "Should we go on?",
  "54552": "Did you imply that he has children of his own, sir?",
  "54553": "Do you by chance happen to think of establishing a telegraph?",
  "54554": "What right have we to make these charges?",
  "54555": "And how's this for high?",
  "54556": "How did she murder?",
  "54557": "Are we ready?",
  "54558": "Whose is this little boy?",
  "54559": "You engaged all these men yourself?",
  "54560": "But your honor will look at the baby?",
  "54561": "And if the husband is kind and straightforward, why should not love last?",
  "54562": "Charge?",
  "54563": "Well, then, these tracks upon the grass, were they coming or going?",
  "54564": "Through this window?",
  "54565": "What iss happened?",
  "54566": "How many hundred dollars, now, do you put on for this religion?",
  "54567": "Have I done anything to vex you, grandmother?",
  "54568": "And you only married him on that account?",
  "54569": "All set?",
  "54570": "Do you swear that to me?",
  "54571": "Should the aim of punishment be the reformation of the criminal?",
  "54572": "And will these save our lives?",
  "54573": "Is that question in the interests of science too?",
  "54574": "Eh, my pretty?",
  "54575": "Have you entire confidence in your chief officer?",
  "54576": "Is not this true?",
  "54577": "But what has happened?",
  "54578": "What at our hands demand ye?",
  "54579": "What could either do, that I cannot?",
  "54580": "What therefore do you pretend to?",
  "54581": "But those who brought you up?",
  "54582": "Then it must be an ellipse?",
  "54583": "Haven't you seen enough?",
  "54584": "Have we taken alive an inhabitant of the seas of primitive ages?",
  "54585": "Then, why not come away with me?",
  "54586": "Where did he live?",
  "54587": "Or is this pretty artifice contrived, to signify that here the chase must end, and my pursuit be crowned, for you can fly no further?",
  "54588": "Why has so violent a movement been followed by so long a repose?",
  "54589": "A lover?",
  "54590": "But isn't it really an illusion to think you can get out of it?",
  "54591": "What's wrang?",
  "54592": "Don't you remember what reply he gave?",
  "54593": "Can they have finished ploughing?",
  "54594": "Is there any one forgotten thing afore we parts?",
  "54595": "But surely one can do that sometimes?",
  "54596": "Sylvestre?",
  "54597": "And why should your majesty suspect me of dissimulation, I ask?",
  "54598": "Has something special happened?",
  "54599": "Why not try and please us this time?",
  "54600": "How could you behave so unfairly by your sister?",
  "54601": "Am I to believe there's anything real in what you say?",
  "54602": "That's all?",
  "54603": "Why did you suffer him to live?",
  "54604": "Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends?",
  "54605": "Would you like to inhale it for a second?",
  "54606": "Is he not prorsus inutilis ad thorum?",
  "54607": "Do you mean that there is no such maker or creator, or that in one sense there might be a maker of all these things but in another not?",
  "54608": "Well, little girl, what is it?",
  "54609": "Do not you feel a certain vibration of the soil?",
  "54610": "What is that machine?",
  "54611": "Are you quite sure?",
  "54612": "You were going to say?",
  "54613": "Where did these things take place?",
  "54614": "What did you say?",
  "54615": "How do you know where to go to?",
  "54616": "To you and myself?",
  "54617": "Have you recovered the lost tracks?",
  "54618": "Now what does this mean?",
  "54619": "What does it matter to you now, in any case?",
  "54620": "Our father?",
  "54621": "Children, who'd like to race the horses with me?",
  "54622": "Never mind, never mind, what does it matter?",
  "54623": "What o'clock was this?",
  "54624": "And would you just throw in a nod when I seem to ask you for it?",
  "54625": "What was he to say?",
  "54626": "And what is your success?",
  "54627": "Isn't it large?",
  "54628": "That's a most puzzling expression for a natural science man, do you understand?",
  "54629": "Was he not made?",
  "54630": "Would an exchange of name be an exchange of rights?",
  "54631": "And have we, any on us, yet come so low as he come?",
  "54632": "At the same place?",
  "54633": "Have you no longer any kind feeling for your father?",
  "54634": "Out, even to me?",
  "54635": "Do you know?",
  "54636": "The tide?",
  "54637": "Did you receive my little note the day before yesterday?",
  "54638": "What sort of a report would they bring of the result?",
  "54639": "And what are you jawing for like that?",
  "54640": "What did you see?",
  "54641": "Going to see the pictures?",
  "54642": "But who should be the executioner?",
  "54643": "And what was that working?",
  "54644": "What are you going to do about him?",
  "54645": "You are not worse, are you?",
  "54646": "Why not go right down now and fix him?",
  "54647": "If I name one fact you don't know, will you give me back my rifle?",
  "54648": "You may have recognized the fumes?",
  "54649": "Oh, what does that matter?",
  "54650": "From whom did you get this?",
  "54651": "Who do you reckon 't is?",
  "54652": "Why did he not break it there, since it is evident that every yard that he carried it increased the risk of someone meeting him?",
  "54653": "Which I took hold of and was merrily asking him what he would take to have it said for my honour that it was of my getting?",
  "54654": "How did it come to be cut like that?",
  "54655": "Why do you trample upon dead bodies in this temple?",
  "54656": "Whence have you come?",
  "54657": "And how did it happen?",
  "54658": "What do you consider to be the greatest blessing which you have reaped from your wealth?",
  "54659": "Where got she the strength to resist the impulse?",
  "54660": "Anything I like?",
  "54661": "Micawber?",
  "54662": "Are you a large party?",
  "54663": "What were our feelings at that moment?",
  "54664": "Where are you running to?",
  "54665": "A document?",
  "54666": "Do you not reckon me?",
  "54667": "MATERIALS?",
  "54668": "Will any antiquarian inform us, if possible, why these bones were placed here?",
  "54669": "And what do you call these, my darling?",
  "54670": "As to you, monseigneur?",
  "54671": "And had he any right to ask her for a revelation of feelings which she had evidently intended to withhold from him?",
  "54672": "Which of the three is it?",
  "54673": "What do I say?",
  "54674": "And you heard what he said?",
  "54675": "Will you give them to me?",
  "54676": "Well, and what have you been doing?",
  "54677": "Why are there no daffodils now?",
  "54678": "Is it not a happy feeling?",
  "54679": "Why sacrifice forty?",
  "54680": "Where's that ten cents?",
  "54681": "And if he left off dreaming about you, where do you suppose you'd be?",
  "54682": "With your brother?",
  "54683": "Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy?",
  "54684": "Can't you see, you're killing me?",
  "54685": "Now, dear, what are your own?",
  "54686": "I suffer from emotion?",
  "54687": "What laws are there for us?",
  "54688": "And shall she have the head she covets?",
  "54689": "Would she go out to work again?",
  "54690": "Where did I disappear to?",
  "54691": "And you have no way to get news of them?",
  "54692": "Again the law?",
  "54693": "Aunt, will you have some beef?",
  "54694": "Saw her?",
  "54695": "But I must know that you love me, mustn't I?",
  "54696": "Shall we get out and try to find the road?",
  "54697": "You found something compromising?",
  "54698": "Do you see this letter?",
  "54699": "The gentleman who receives us?",
  "54700": "Where de debble did you come frum?",
  "54701": "Has my father asked you for money?",
  "54702": "Who are you, that you should question the judgment of the nations and the ages?",
  "54703": "What would they do in that case?",
  "54704": "You have not counted me out as equal to so much land, and calculated on me as a balance at your banker's?",
  "54705": "Do you know what this plant is?",
  "54706": "Was he awake, or was it but a dream?",
  "54707": "I wonder where we can go next?",
  "54708": "Are you thinking, if I'm drunk itself, I'd leave my daughter living single with a little frisky rascal is the like of you?",
  "54709": "And what awaits you if you remain faithful to your oath, and obey the commands given you?",
  "54710": "Sire, have you in the army one regiment on which you can implicitly rely?",
  "54711": "Will it take long?",
  "54712": "What's that pump stopping for?",
  "54713": "But then, why do you repulse me?",
  "54714": "Are you willing?",
  "54715": "Have I any?",
  "54716": "I wish you'd lend me half a sovereign, will you?",
  "54717": "No, really?",
  "54718": "Can't you see those good people, with a totally strange woman bursting into their house?",
  "54719": "Has he left you for another?",
  "54720": "Can we really affect the adversary's will?",
  "54721": "Shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the sea?",
  "54722": "Was it possible for her to forgive him?",
  "54723": "D'you like all that frilly, bunchy stuff at the throat?",
  "54724": "What purpose do they serve?",
  "54725": "Oh is it?",
  "54726": "Were all those dear, sorrowful, valiant, charming or tragic beings merely dreams?",
  "54727": "Is there anything of the feminine gender among them?",
  "54728": "Lodging?",
  "54729": "Not his brother?",
  "54730": "And which of them made this passage?",
  "54731": "Not more?",
  "54732": "Has he been examined by any synod or council?",
  "54733": "Have you any objection to see him in my presence?",
  "54734": "But what about them at home?",
  "54735": "I must have been ordered abroad, but how could I have gone?",
  "54736": "What is the difference between light and the lustre which is seen on the polished surface of opaque bodies?",
  "54737": "Now, ma'am, am I a fool?",
  "54738": "You know who that is?",
  "54739": "Had she left no friends, no relations behind her?",
  "54740": "What are you doing?",
  "54741": "You will, won't you, dear?",
  "54742": "You'll take me as I am, with nothing?",
  "54743": "Things are all right with you then?",
  "54744": "Ought he to turn to the left or to the right?",
  "54745": "Who dares?",
  "54746": "But how did you manage it, little pa?",
  "54747": "Some what?",
  "54748": "Do you give it to me?",
  "54749": "Tell me, are you human, or are you more than human?",
  "54750": "And you have not made her speak?",
  "54751": "Took hold of you?",
  "54752": "Have you not talked long enough to drink?",
  "54753": "How can you be so cruel to me?",
  "54754": "Are you better?",
  "54755": "Who is it that you have fallen in love with, my poor fellow?",
  "54756": "Come, come, who did you think we were when you ran away from us?",
  "54757": "But what do you require of me, then?",
  "54758": "Do you like roses?",
  "54759": "Not just yet?",
  "54760": "Was there ever a loser content with the loss of the game?",
  "54761": "Going?",
  "54762": "What's the colour of their stockings?",
  "54763": "Why do you look at us like that?",
  "54764": "Does his daughter know of the relapse?",
  "54765": "Is it not a pity that people who are bright and clever should so often be exceedingly improper?",
  "54766": "What did it all mean?",
  "54767": "Would you like a little mash?",
  "54768": "And what salary do you ask?",
  "54769": "I s'pose you'll be starting off for college in a fortnight's time?",
  "54770": "Did you see a young lad passing this way in the early morning or the fall of night?",
  "54771": "How can you say so?",
  "54772": "Could inertia of race, on such a scale, be broken up, or take new form?",
  "54773": "And how did he treat you?",
  "54774": "You, dear mamma?",
  "54775": "What line shall you take, then?",
  "54776": "Towards a new sun?",
  "54777": "May I come in, guardian?",
  "54778": "Has he finished his turn?",
  "54779": "Mahotin?",
  "54780": "Yet why did he come?",
  "54781": "There are those sharks now over the side, don't you see they prefer it tough and rare?",
  "54782": "If you decide to go, why shouldn't you go in the same ship?",
  "54783": "Is it as bad as all that?",
  "54784": "How old are you and what's your name?",
  "54785": "Are the others coming out?",
  "54786": "Are you certain that you can afford to part with so much money, and that it is right that it should be so expended?",
  "54787": "Queer notion, wasn't it?",
  "54788": "Was that last night?",
  "54789": "And is the gentleman who fired at us the governor of the fortress?",
  "54790": "Is my pa in, do you know?",
  "54791": "Is that all?",
  "54792": "Won't you join us?",
  "54793": "Was this ever possible?",
  "54794": "Their hair?",
  "54795": "Did they leave these two industries to themselves?",
  "54796": "Do they by attaching to the soul and inhering in her at last bring her to death, and so separate her from the body ?",
  "54797": "Have you been slightly dazzled at the sudden fusion of my ingots?",
  "54798": "Perhaps you did not like it?",
  "54799": "Did he look in this way?",
  "54800": "To me?",
  "54801": "But, look here, are you a great hand with the ladies?",
  "54802": "Have you?",
  "54803": "Was he a man or only a crosseyed thief an a loafer?",
  "54804": "Or was he ordered to inflict this punishment upon me?",
  "54805": "Is that all the story?",
  "54806": "None of it at all?",
  "54807": "And how do you find home, now you have come back to it?",
  "54808": "Do you suppose you could find any good in a child by whipping him?",
  "54809": "Is it the secret instinct of decaying nature, or the soul's impulsive throb, as immortality draws on?",
  "54810": "Who was the youth he had adopted and who bore so striking a resemblance to him?",
  "54811": "You wouldn't like to marry a small tradesman or a working man, would you?",
  "54812": "And his offence?",
  "54813": "Are you sure you are not making a mistake?",
  "54814": "You mean your papers?",
  "54815": "It is a poor conclusion, is it not?",
  "54816": "It may also be called temperate, and for the same reasons?",
  "54817": "Don't you think agricultural laborers would rather have three acres and a cow than three acres of printed forms and a committee?",
  "54818": "But surely this is somewhat irrelevant?",
  "54819": "Was it very vile to be dragged back here again?",
  "54820": "Can you break an engagement off slowly?",
  "54821": "Do you wish to ruin us outright?",
  "54822": "Any how does she do?",
  "54823": "You called me a creature of civilization, or something, didn't you?",
  "54824": "Neckett's children?",
  "54825": "Safe?",
  "54826": "My friends, why do I wish for peace?",
  "54827": "Won't you even stay for tea?",
  "54828": "Can he speak?",
  "54829": "And why not with you?",
  "54830": "Well, do you like it?",
  "54831": "What was she to do?",
  "54832": "But can you make any sense out of them?",
  "54833": "He was not playing, then?",
  "54834": "Rosamond a sufferer, a labourer, a female apostle?",
  "54835": "Who could grant them?",
  "54836": "What were you saying about being married?",
  "54837": "That's it, ain't it?",
  "54838": "Was he engaged in a struggle with some animal whose retreat he had disturbed?",
  "54839": "But certain, if execution be remiss or blindfold now, and in this particular, what will it be hereafter and in other books?",
  "54840": "Did he sign, too?",
  "54841": "You're not angry with me any more?",
  "54842": "Have you considered what it is to undermine the confidence that should subsist between my daughter and myself?",
  "54843": "How long will this fuse burn?",
  "54844": "Why do you hesitate?",
  "54845": "How can I ever describe the charm and picturesqueness of that summer life?",
  "54846": "May I write to you?",
  "54847": "This will be your luggage, I suppose?",
  "54848": "How could that bring you?",
  "54849": "But all our praises why should lords engross?",
  "54850": "And what then would you say?",
  "54851": "There might possibly be some hundreds, and what could three men do, even armed to the teeth, against such a multitude?",
  "54852": "What is your opinion on the matter?",
  "54853": "Pictures are like wine, and want age, you think?",
  "54854": "Where is the entrance?",
  "54855": "The barricade?",
  "54856": "What is life at all?",
  "54857": "If you please, sir, should I have no brandy nor nothing to give the poor creetur?",
  "54858": "Is he kind to her?",
  "54859": "Who is conducting the prosecution?",
  "54860": "Is it mingled with anger or hate?",
  "54861": "What had he to do, indeed?",
  "54862": "Why, what, madam, does it signify what I think?",
  "54863": "Will it be believed that the night of so brilliant a day was for me a night of anguish and perplexity?",
  "54864": "Is not this an agreeable surprise?",
  "54865": "What can you not understand?",
  "54866": "Yes, but where?",
  "54867": "What did you burn 'em for?",
  "54868": "But what does that signify?",
  "54869": "Has it indeed?",
  "54870": "What do you want, sir?",
  "54871": "How did that help you?",
  "54872": "Let me hear it?",
  "54873": "But then again, what has the whale to say?",
  "54874": "What power?",
  "54875": "Surely he has some opinion?",
  "54876": "Will it be soon?",
  "54877": "Must I, then?",
  "54878": "Do you call that nourishment?",
  "54879": "What WERE these things?",
  "54880": "Polo?",
  "54881": "Does he like the moor?",
  "54882": "What, dares the villain write in such base terms?",
  "54883": "But what can I do?",
  "54884": "You are quite sure?",
  "54885": "Publish what, you unreasonable man?",
  "54886": "And where do you come from?",
  "54887": "What letter do you mean she returned unopened?",
  "54888": "Why should I not stay here?",
  "54889": "Whence did our servitude commence?",
  "54890": "You insist?",
  "54891": "What's the motive?",
  "54892": "Could he not hinder that, by persuading her out of her system of privation?",
  "54893": "Well, mon cher, what are you doing personally?",
  "54894": "Do you propose to me to do so, D'Artagnan?",
  "54895": "What did he know of himself?",
  "54896": "What is the young lady's name?",
  "54897": "Shall I adventure?",
  "54898": "You won't go either, will you?",
  "54899": "Is that his child?",
  "54900": "Then, sire?",
  "54901": "Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its contents?",
  "54902": "Object to in them?",
  "54903": "Have you any thing further?",
  "54904": "Why, what do they want with more?",
  "54905": "Tell me, therefore, who are these men who killed the son with despair, and the father with famine?",

  "55699": "If so, what became of them in those dreadful days?",
  "55700": "How can we here?",
  "55701": "Did he understand that he had made a grave mistake?",
  "55702": "Nor courage either?",
  "55703": "Oh, isn't it all right?",
  "55704": "Now will you do what I want you to?",
  "55705": "No light repartee, have you, old bean?",
  "55706": "Some people said it was because he couldn't sell it, but I'd rather believe that it was out of the kindness of his heart, wouldn't you?",
  "55707": "How did you word your inquiries?",
  "55708": "Can we not avoid them by keeping to the shore?",
  "55709": "Is it improper and unsafe to intermix the different powers of government in the same body of men?",
  "55710": "Do you promise to deliver it?",
  "55711": "How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil?",
  "55712": "So you won't be my friend?",
  "55713": "Who are you?",
  "55714": "What is your name?",
  "55715": "Did you see him then?",
  "55716": "Then I suppose I was to hold my tongue and say nothing?",
  "55717": "And you don't care for women at all after twenty?",
  "55718": "How could the fruits follow?",
  "55719": "His name?",
  "55720": "Why the devil have they any stairs with such windows?",
  "55721": "What made you open it?",
  "55722": "You have seen him at work?",
  "55723": "Where else can I ask him?",
  "55724": "But can we not descend?",
  "55725": "Pip, will you tell me something?",
  "55726": "What lunacy is this, that haunts this man?",
  "55727": "Say, how long are you going to stay here?",
  "55728": "How shall I make my music now?",
  "55729": "Can I never act for you, and you for me?",
  "55730": "Do you think it is true?",
  "55731": "How would you like that?",
  "55732": "Why is she so excruciatingly beautiful that I cannot be angry with her, even now?",
  "55733": "That is your affair?",
  "55734": "You know he shot his brother?",
  "55735": "What noise was that?",
  "55736": "What would you give that you could help loving me?",
  "55737": "Do we suppose that principle, whatever it may be in man, which has to do with justice and injustice, to be inferior to the body?",
  "55738": "Yes, what it is?",
  "55739": "Where had he seen those lineaments?",
  "55740": "Of what was I speaking?",
  "55741": "Never in moderation?",
  "55742": "Is the other one stuffed also?",
  "55743": "What best wishes?",
  "55744": "I mean the one with the three naked women?",
  "55745": "Why, who else could I possibly suspect?",
  "55746": "What made you leave me to come here alone?",
  "55747": "Something will turn up?",
  "55748": "Abandon this subject altogether, and again jeer at the monks and ridicule the nuns?",
  "55749": "Have these very matters ever produced any difficulty amongst us?",
  "55750": "Have I not also critics who do not spare me?",
  "55751": "What avails recrimination over matters wholly past recall?",
  "55752": "It die?",
  "55753": "But if he had escaped?",
  "55754": "Who was that insolent fellow?",
  "55755": "What new mystery was this?",
  "55756": "What do I think of it?",
  "55757": "Won't you ever change your mind?",
  "55758": "If I were alone, would he not at times force his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or to contemplate its progress?",
  "55759": "Is not this unavoidable?",
  "55760": "Have you spoken to her?",
  "55761": "But what could it do, if any danger came?",
  "55762": "That would be good, wouldn't it?",
  "55763": "Could it be for any other reason than that he did not want to see it, and if so was he not a traitor to the cause of truth?",
  "55764": "Why are better results attained under scientific management than under the other types?",
  "55765": "Ah, a weapon?",
  "55766": "Run away?",
  "55767": "What was he, then?",
  "55768": "Matter?",
  "55769": "Not paralysis, I hope?",
  "55770": "Run away?",
  "55771": "What does he say?",
  "55772": "Why is it that the peace of the country is disturbed in order that one people may assume to judge of what another people should do?",
  "55773": "So you think he'll make her an offer today?",
  "55774": "But where is he?",
  "55775": "Don't you want to tell me?",
  "55776": "It beseemeth us both better, forsooth, to leave this undone, for why should I honor one who doth bear me hatred?",
  "55777": "It was the only letter you had?",
  "55778": "You have no explanation yourself of the tragedy?",
  "55779": "What do you mean by having made a stiff?",
  "55780": "What different armour should I need?",
  "55781": "Should he abandon her?",
  "55782": "Who is with him?",
  "55783": "Can you bear witness that you're no better than a fool?",
  "55784": "It will be asked, how did this mischief happen?",
  "55785": "What should I do with a translation?",
  "55786": "You did not get my letter?",
  "55787": "By whom was she espied, and how entrapped?",
  "55788": "And weren't you ever afraid?",
  "55789": "Is she a very massive person?",
  "55790": "And what is your opinion?",
  "55791": "Perchance you think to put him i' the thick of the shots?",
  "55792": "According to scientific notions of inertia and force, what ought to be the result?",
  "55793": "And your address?",
  "55794": "What sort of husband can he be?",
  "55795": "How do they use to be?",
  "55796": "Why should we?",
  "55797": "What are you doing there, you rascal?",
  "55798": "Convicts?",
  "55799": "Why, then, are you about to betray it to me?",
  "55800": "But even in that case, may he have no object beyond his present station, to which he may sacrifice his independence?",
  "55801": "And powder, and bullets?",
  "55802": "Would you believe, my dear friend, that the persons to whom I made these candid protestations laughed at my credulity?",
  "55803": "Have you had one of your bad nights?",
  "55804": "What, my friends, must be the consequences of this agitation?",
  "55805": "Can I do anything for you, gentlemen?",
  "55806": "Is he not a beauty?",
  "55807": "Could he still rise and regain his footing in his conscience upon something solid?",
  "55808": "Don't you know it?",
  "55809": "Is it not indeed great enough, sire?",
  "55810": "Are you ambitious, and do you seek after the greatnesses of the earth?",
  "55811": "When they have no leaves and look gray and brown and dry, how can you tell whether they are dead or alive?",
  "55812": "Would we be able to see those pictures?",
  "55813": "Then if children make so much trouble, why do people have 'em?",
  "55814": "And you never confined your patients?",
  "55815": "How could you be so obstinate?",
  "55816": "Tom, what on earth ails that cat?",
  "55817": "Then I did not kill him?",
  "55818": "If he had not had his 'profonde' what would he have done?",
  "55819": "What is to be done with her, then?",
  "55820": "Do you know what it is?",
  "55821": "I do something?",
  "55822": "Which way went he, young man?",
  "55823": "Are you coming to this ball?",
  "55824": "Why did he not correct our judgment at the start?",
  "55825": "How can one deceive these dear little birds, when they look at one so sweetly and confidingly?",
  "55826": "Is wealth thy passion?",
  "55827": "What is the matter at home?",
  "55828": "Is there any sense in it?",
  "55829": "And where is he going?",
  "55830": "Well, what have I to do with that?",
  "55831": "Do you not consume supplies as fast as you get them forward?",
  "55832": "But, what am I saying?",
  "55833": "Shall we try argument?",
  "55834": "She is at home?",
  "55835": "Verdurin?",
  "55836": "Then I asked if there were many clerks?",
  "55837": "How can he talk like that?",
  "55838": "But who gave you leave to cease eating mutton?",
  "55839": "And what can one do?",
  "55840": "Yes, that is the doctor we've been sewing for, is it?",
  "55841": "What pamphlet is this?",
  "55842": "Was it not for these causes that you send for me when the great trouble came?",
  "55843": "May I live with you, and tend upon you as I used to do?",
  "55844": "Will you unclasp your hand?",
  "55845": "Wasn't you bad enough when you threw all the money away, so you had to go an' do this just when we was in awful trouble?",
  "55846": "Why don't you go to your bankers?",
  "55847": "Do you see this same ram?",
  "55848": "Shall I go and offer her my services?",
  "55849": "And why does the minister keep his hand over his heart?",
  "55850": "Who keeps house here?",
  "55851": "Are they not bubbles?",
  "55852": "How is all with you?",
  "55853": "Tasting?",
  "55854": "What are his qualifications?",
  "55855": "Where did you start from?",
  "55856": "Could anything cause us to swerve to one side?",
  "55857": "And are not both the city and the entire temple now full of the dead bodies of your countrymen?",
  "55858": "Couldn't we start out and scour the country before the fellow gets away?",
  "55859": "You dine and sleep here, of course?",
  "55860": "What else could I look for, being what I am, and leading such a life as mine?",
  "55861": "Why didn't you come to dinner?",
  "55862": "Where is this poor giant, or this poor wretch of a vanquished knight, to find her?",
  "55863": "It is the first time, then, that you ever went to that house?",
  "55864": "How may we pass that which is impassable?",
  "55865": "In what stables champed these sleek, nervous horses and rested the gorgeous carriages?",
  "55866": "And what am I to tell your father?",
  "55867": "The box of mischief thus opened in society, what is to preserve private virtue, the only security of public freedom and universal happiness?",
  "55868": "My father is well, is he not?",
  "55869": "Was it going farther from, or nearing, the disc?",
  "55870": "How is this?",
  "55871": "Recollect, my lord, if he did not say something a little like that to you?",
  "55872": "Is he really her cousin, as he says?",
  "55873": "Who's to prevent me?",
  "55874": "Why dig up the pestilence from the pit in which it is buried?",
  "55875": "The other question?",
  "55876": "I may go on?",
  "55877": "And by whom?",
  "55878": "It is true, then?",
  "55879": "Should an ass exceed me in fortitude?",
  "55880": "Would the island hold together till then?",
  "55881": "No, why should you?",
  "55882": "What can I do sir?",
  "55883": "Should I have remained in that house, near you and them, if I did not love them?",
  "55884": "And this letter?",
  "55885": "What d'you charge for a ride, boss?",
  "55886": "What is the matter?",
  "55887": "And if it be so, what is it?",
  "55888": "Mother, what are you crying for?",
  "55889": "Were I to allow you to march out, what security can I have that you will not join them, and afterwards fight against me?",
  "55890": "Reinforcements?",
  "55891": "What would it be right to do?",
  "55892": "What's up with you?",
  "55893": "Should it ever be said that he had robbed those old men, whom he so truly and so tenderly loved in his heart of hearts?",
  "55894": "What made you think he'd ceased to take any interest in the case?",
  "55895": "Is it anything I have done that has pulled you down like that?",
  "55896": "What could my father mean by sending me to be an inmate in this strange family?",
  "55897": "You mean you'll have no quarrel with me?",
  "55898": "Was he awake or was he asleep?",
  "55899": "Well, but if I bought the mill, and allowed your husband to act as my manager in the same way, how then?",
  "55900": "What am I to do if I love him and the other one too?",
  "55901": "And have you come from far like this?",
  "55902": "And what did I tell 'ee?",
  "55903": "Could she, who had been so active in the getting up of the funeral triumph, do less than exult?",
  "55904": "Who now will tell the ladies that I would hie me thither?",
  "55905": "What is genius?",
  "55906": "You have taken care, I hope, of the casket I sent you to lock up?",
  "55907": "What evils?",
  "55908": "And is it wounded?",
  "55909": "What recollections of boyhood and innocence might have been flitting across his brain?",
  "55910": "What noise is that?",
  "55911": "No dignity in whaling?",
  "55912": "Why could they not wait a little?",
  "55913": "No apology, I suppose?",
  "55914": "What are you thinking of?",
  "55915": "How have I offended?",
  "55916": "Why should we be unable to preserve a remembrance of them?",
  "55917": "There is something else you wanted to say?",
  "55918": "Was I not right in saying at the outset that, relatively to the tax, we are behind our institutions?",
  "55919": "What charge, sir?",
  "55920": "Did you see no one?",
  "55921": "Ah, now, couldn't you take me with you?",
  "55922": "Oh, may I get this rose?",
  "55923": "He asked me whether I would go with him?",
  "55924": "A'n't you getting all you hoped for, ay, and more than you hoped for?",
  "55925": "Why did you leave him on the road?",
  "55926": "And in such a case what is one to say?",
  "55927": "Yes, why?",
  "55928": "To which of us?",
  "55929": "Could we not break it?",
  "55930": "What does he drink?",
  "55931": "But however are you going to race in this mud?",
  "55932": "Is this the part of wise men, engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty?",
  "55933": "Cannot you describe her?",
  "55934": "And that which is not more or less a harmony is not more or less harmonized?",
  "55935": "A joke?",
  "55936": "What is his folly?",
  "55937": "I must, then, remain here?",
  "55938": "Who were they?",
  "55939": "Mercenary, mem?",
  "55940": "Well then, my dear, why don't you praise the neatness and prettiness with which it's kept?",
  "55941": "Have you not read in my eyes that there is nothing but devotion and sympathy in my heart?",
  "55942": "Is that worth talking about and making so much ado?",
  "55943": "When are you starting?",
  "55944": "You want no treasures and no castles?",
  "55945": "You will live on our selection, won't you?",
  "55946": "He wouldn't have so much influence, then, don't you reckon?",
  "55947": "Now then, gentlemen, shall I break the seal or not?",
  "55948": "It must have been on the boulevard?",
  "55949": "Could a statue of marble have been more impassive and more mute?",
  "55950": "Would you like to?",
  "55951": "Do you call yourself a raw country girl?",
  "55952": "And, then, do you think that my stumps are pretty?",
  "55953": "But do you fail to live?",
  "55954": "Sure it's he?",
  "55955": "Whose fault?",
  "55956": "She has formed no other attachment?",
  "55957": "What matter?",
  "55958": "And wherefore has he not been to see me?",
  "55959": "Shall we really try it?",
  "55960": "Doth any praise himself?",
  "55961": "Now, then, where's the first boy?",
  "55962": "What has age to do with it?",
  "55963": "What besides?",
  "55964": "Separate, my dear?",
  "55965": "Now, why don't you take my advice?",
  "55966": "Do you wish I hadn't come?",
  "55967": "And alone?",
  "55968": "Why should I pull her into it?",
  "55969": "You would not kill yourself?",
  "55970": "No cheering news, then?",
  "55971": "And with what object?",
  "55972": "Monks would never learn how you knew what you do?",
  "55973": "What do you keep SAYING you will for?",
  "55974": "Was it so?",
  "55975": "But the earl?",
  "55976": "Do you see, now, one reason why I have let you go thus early into the world?",
  "55977": "Will you show me your plan?",
  "55978": "Can't one cut pages with a garden knife?",
  "55979": "What needs appealing in a fact so plain?",
  "55980": "And if he have great riches, to you leave him all his wealth, or do you make him a beggar?",
  "55981": "Bast?",
  "55982": "What was it you wanted to ask, sir?",
  "55983": "Did you ever hear such a name?",
  "55984": "Can it attack it beneath the waves?",
  "55985": "To those who love as ourselves, in what respect differs a year from an hour?",
  "55986": "And you think that just?",
  "55987": "You will start at once?",
  "55988": "To what point of the continent?",
  "55989": "From whence can she come?",
  "55990": "Will you play?",
  "55991": "What's to hinder 'em from cutting right and left if they begin?",
  "55992": "Give up the parish altogether?",
  "55993": "And what was the policy of that ally?",
  "55994": "But who should tell him so?",
  "55995": "Her voice when she talked to them?",
  "55996": "Would the militia, in this supposition, be more ready or more able to support the federal authority than in the case of a general union?",
  "55997": "Is he in favor of all these things at once?",
  "55998": "Or show you restless, miswandering, misclimbing ones, new and easier footpaths?",
  "55999": "Do you think the thing possible?",
  "56000": "Is the door shut?",
  "56001": "But what will you do?",
  "56002": "Well, then, have you any better plan to propose?",
  "56003": "What, have you a wife, then?",
  "56004": "But does nothing depend on it for them?",
  "56005": "You are well?",
  "56006": "You do love me still?",
  "56007": "Where do your excellencies wish to go?",
  "56008": "Then what the devil brought you here, being a churchman?",
  "56009": "You know what to beautify is, I suppose?",
  "56010": "How can I commit such treachery?",
  "56011": "And what is it doing in the world?",
  "56012": "Do you know, sir?",
  "56013": "And what does it amount to, after all?",
  "56014": "By his son, sir?",
  "56015": "But how, madame?",
  "56016": "What course is that?",
  "56017": "What did the gardener say?",
  "56018": "Why cucumber sandwiches?",
  "56019": "A duel, you mean?",
  "56020": "But what is thy name?",
  "56021": "Ma foi, what rival?",
  "56022": "An't that as nat'ral as walking, and as good for the health?",
  "56023": "Do I then strive after HAPPINESS?",
  "56024": "One should never admit anything in electioneering matters, should one?",
  "56025": "Is she game for that?",
  "56026": "Is it void of understanding?",
  "56027": "And who dictated it?",
  "56028": "Was it not this?",
  "56029": "Who's there?",
  "56030": "What next, I wonder?",
  "56031": "What ails you?",
  "56032": "But what of that, so long as it tickles the palate more strongly?",
  "56033": "Is the sea not full of green islands?",
  "56034": "Whence then this obvious DISQUALITY?",
  "56035": "There is a deficit, you say?",
  "56036": "And is it the case now?",
  "56037": "Because you can see she is in love with you?",
  "56038": "Who was the man?",
  "56039": "Where does he tempt one to stray from duty?",
  "56040": "What does it strike you that I've done?",
  "56041": "Money down?",
  "56042": "Jane's mother is going to let her have a birthday party?",
  "56043": "Have you not shelter, and food, and leisure?",
  "56044": "And what can be said in, at least, partial defence of the actual historical procedure of the nations?",
  "56045": "What should I get by sending to you?",
  "56046": "Sailors?",
  "56047": "You found her well and awaiting you?",
  "56048": "Where is it located?",
  "56049": "Didn't the cavalry all start this morning?",
  "56050": "Why, what do you mean?",
  "56051": "What other men can be thirty leagues under ground?",
  "56052": "What, is it laborers they want for the harvest?",
  "56053": "Who shall describe the anxiety, the agony, which in some measure must have been the lot of every frontier family?",
  "56054": "Why didn't we think of that before?",
  "56055": "What the devil are you doing there in such an agitated manner?",
  "56056": "And what will that signify to me?",
  "56057": "Why will you be silent?",
  "56058": "How then stands the case?",
  "56059": "And you think it funny, no doubt?",
  "56060": "What is gentleness?",
  "56061": "Do you wish this change so very much, sir?",
  "56062": "Do you think I can teach a small school?",
  "56063": "What can I do, my son?",
  "56064": "For a more active primate?",
  "56065": "What on earth is up?",
  "56066": "Where are you going, then, dear bear?",
  "56067": "Shall we have them sit up to the table and serve them with the complete dinner, enlivening it with intellectual conversation?",
  "56068": "Well, fwiend?",
  "56069": "Had anything occurred that was likely to alienate her from her family?",
  "56070": "And papa's written consent?",
  "56071": "How could he have been so forgetful?",
  "56072": "And taking it as a story, what do you think of it?",
  "56073": "Can he be afraid of this boy?",
  "56074": "How about returning?",
  "56075": "Don't you mean the composition pedals?",
  "56076": "Well, what is there surprising in that?",
  "56077": "Do you see any objection?",
  "56078": "I wonder when he got the message?",
  "56079": "You hadn't?",
  "56080": "You will, of course, command it yourself?",
  "56081": "What in the name heaven shall I do?",
  "56082": "What is the process for releasing a prisoner?",
  "56083": "O, what's up now?",
  "56084": "I mean, have you ever been where there's water?",
  "56085": "How could I forget it?",
  "56086": "And where is her husband?",
  "56087": "Thomasin, do you know that they have had a bitter quarrel?",
  "56088": "So you're in the washing business, ma'am?",
  "56089": "And I am to hide my guilt, as I have done so many years?",
  "56090": "Pray what was his offence?",
  "56091": "Was it possible he had deceived himself so utterly about her?",

  "56630": "Five?",
  "56631": "Get my note?",
  "56632": "Who could want me?",
  "56633": "Don't look like the sort of one to get any, do he?",
  "56634": "I wish to know whether you desire this arrangement or whether you do not?",
  "56635": "Is it the story he would not understand, or the storyteller?",
  "56636": "Would not one of these have served?",
  "56637": "Are you thinking them's his boots?",
  "56638": "Can't you leave me alone?",
  "56639": "For the purpose of making investigations there?",
  "56640": "I ask you where are you going, you villain?",
  "56641": "And if it is still empty?",
  "56642": "But are you under the impression that you have so great a mind that you can understand the most profound writer at a first reading?",
  "56643": "Do you like sitting alone?",
  "56644": "Such a revelation, do you say?",

  "56665": "Whose fault is that?",
  "56666": "Why, what did you call it yesterday, then, leaving your sister's house in a tantrum?",
  "56667": "Is reason, then, synonymous with intelligence?",
  "56668": "What is there to say to such a question?",
  "56669": "What should be our attitude toward separate schools?",
  "56670": "How is it they don't take proper precautions?",
  "56671": "Don't you want to see it?",
  "56672": "Or is it to be decided by your own laws, by your own rules of judicature?",
  "56673": "Do you see that brooch?",
  "56674": "You were there the next morning about noon?",
  "56675": "Why did you not tell me that you contemplated ambushing those fellows?",

  "56678": "Now, what call have you to say that?",
  "56679": "You do, do you?",
  "56680": "If it is useless, are they poorer?",
  "56681": "You don't understand?",
  "56682": "Why must you?",
  "56683": "Now, will you?",
  "56684": "But have you tried?",
  "56685": "What more did he ask you?",
  "56686": "Does not this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practical resolution in facing death?",
  "56687": "Everybody liked her, didn't they?",
  "56688": "Appears against the boy, does he?",

  "56692": "Who are you?",
  "56693": "I hope you don't suppose there's anybody here who is to prevent my talking as I like?",
  "56694": "Can any one doubt as to the reason of it?",
  "56695": "But you will not mind for one evening, dear?",
  "56696": "You have been ill?",
  "56697": "But what could a ball do against the scaly armour with which these enormous beasts were clad?",

  "56730": "If you think it's so lovely, why don't you go and see it yourself?",
  "56731": "You noticed that I didn't breathe a word as to the purpose of our visit?",
  "56732": "How am I?",
  "56733": "And who that considers the weight of the burden on this man's back, will say that the prayer was an improper one?",
  "56734": "What is the good of making him inhale ammonia and all that parcel of drugs?",
  "56735": "Why should you not be there?",
  "56736": "How on earth am I to tell her that I am a respectable, engaged member of society and it's all over between us?",
  "56737": "And you have it still?",
  "56738": "And how do you know it?",
  "56739": "Shall I be baffled thus?",

  "56747": "Do you hear me say he struck me?",
  "56748": "Do you call that LESS?",
  "56749": "But she uttered falsehoods, didn't she?",
  "56750": "Can it be he?",
  "56751": "Why do I tell myself lies?",
  "56752": "But does he therefore confer no benefit when he works for nothing?",
  "56753": "Had he not saved her, and was he not entitled to this honour?",
  "56754": "Is it in property?",
  "56755": "But how was I to write?",
  "56756": "We ought to think of it, oughtn't we?",
  "56757": "Couldn't we take a ride on the top of a tram?",
  "56758": "Are you glad, papa?",
  "56759": "Suppose her majesty refuses?",
  "56760": "Oh, you be, be you?",
  "56761": "Tell me, do you think the number of your company is greater than mine?",
  "56762": "What is any 'discovery' whatever compared with the incessant, eternal discovery of life?",
  "56763": "Sure of what?",
  "56764": "Would you like to give me a kiss for a poem?",
  "56765": "Will you not bring me a little water?",

  "56778": "Don't you know that all the world is talking about you?",
  "56779": "Of what importance, then, is the materiality of the punishment?",
  "56780": "What can we do to save him?",
  "56781": "Have you experienced it?",
  "56782": "'Twas at that I caught 'ee once, if you can mind?",

  "58856": "Is it not the latter's mirror, reflection, echo, an abyss which is concentric with another abyss?",
  "58857": "Have you ever seen a foot like that?",
  "58858": "What is here?",
  "58859": "Has she then a heart for music?",
  "58860": "Can you doubt my equity?",
  "58861": "And she does not condescend to bargain, while I DO, eh?",
  "58862": "Jane, will you marry me?",
  "58863": "What will you be when you are forty?",
  "58864": "Where's your house?",
  "58865": "But, at least, you will be there?",
  "58866": "Think you not then that brains, like yoked cattle, should be put to this leviathan, to make him at all budge to any landsman's imagination?",
  "58867": "Could nothing be done to induce the company to withdraw them?",
  "58868": "Whereabouts downstairs?",
  "58869": "Have I ever been acquainted with you in my youth?",
  "58870": "What's that horrible noise?",
  "58871": "Before I kiss my own darling?",
  "58872": "What's to be done now, brother?",
  "58873": "Ain't I what?",
  "58874": "What madness now possessed me?",
  "58875": "I believe he had suffered a long time?",
  "58876": "And now why are you here?",
  "58877": "Ratafia, fool?",
  "58878": "Does it rain?",
  "58879": "If you have, how can you keep away from me?",
  "58880": "You will remember what I said?",
  "58881": "But the boat?",
  "58882": "You were not certain my child was dead, and you buried it?",
  "58883": "What does it matter to you?",
  "58884": "What is the amount of truth that springs from your laws, and what amount of justice springs from your tribunals?",
  "58885": "O wheres the author of this endles woe?",
  "58886": "But pray what did he say, when I was gone?",
  "58887": "Having found so many good people in my youth, why do I find so few in my age?",
  "58888": "It will be such a delicate compliment, don't you think?",
  "58889": "You only intend, then, to dispose of that part of your fortune which the law allows you to subtract from the inheritance of your son?",
  "58890": "There remains one louis, does there not, master hotelier?",
  "58891": "And the fault of the parents on whom?",
  "58892": "You are alone?",
  "58893": "Did this hatred still seek for vengeance?",
  "58894": "That night when it snew so hard?",
  "58895": "Do my countrymen need any assurance that such a catastrophe is not to overtake them while I possess the power to stay it?",
  "58896": "And why do I ask you?",
  "58897": "And what do you think of it?",
  "58898": "Am I to drive you to the entrance?",
  "58899": "How has he accomplished this?",

  "58902": "Shall I see after the carriage?",
  "58903": "To hang me out for the scorn of all my acquaintance?",
  "58904": "What would have happened if she had not lost that necklace?",
  "58905": "But since he admits, that all their property may be increased fivefold, why should he not allow the same increase to the country?",
  "58906": "Wherefore all these ceaseless toilings?",

  "58912": "If everyone was like your mother, how would the artist live?",
  "58913": "Why not, you rogue of a lawyer, why not?",
  "58914": "Is it not our interest, sir, to betray distrust?",
  "58915": "How can you do it?",
  "58916": "Was she unique?",
  "58917": "Why did they live at the bottom of a well?",
  "58918": "Am I hindering anyone?",

  "58921": "Has it ever happened to you?",
  "58922": "What with him?",
  "58923": "And wherefore was it glorious?",
  "58924": "Is it likely to be more terrifying than my captivity has been sad and gloomy?",
  "58925": "His name?",
  "58926": "Anything new at the office?",
  "58927": "Lay hold on me, sir, for what?",
  "58928": "Was there any use?",
  "58929": "To get married?",
  "58930": "On what ground, we ask, is the proprietor entitled to this rent?",
  "58931": "Where does it lead to?",
  "58932": "And do you take the oldest or the youngest, or only those of ripe age?",
  "58933": "Won't you go now?",
  "58934": "But I want to know where from?",
  "58935": "You are not dreaming of it, are you?",
  "58936": "Who's somebody?",
  "58937": "That is your opinion, is it not?",
  "58938": "Then what do you suggest that we do?",
  "58939": "Could any amount of immorality have placed him in a much worse one?",
  "58940": "Do you see that there is a way in which you could make them all yourself?",
  "58941": "You were one of my pupils, you say?",
  "58942": "Do they teach you to hate me, eh?",
  "58943": "Will the reader believe it?",
  "58944": "You never find that anything goes off here accidentally, do you, my dear friend?",
  "58945": "At what hour does the examination take place?",
  "58946": "Which way did he go?",
  "58947": "Then labor is not to be paid alike?",
  "58948": "And you, queen?",
  "58949": "Is it true, or a lie?",
  "58950": "Will you both come to the shop with me?",
  "58951": "Now whither can I turn?",
  "58952": "If the dogs had scratched the sand up in excavating, how had they carried it so far?",
  "58953": "You will bring him, then?",
  "58954": "What is he, after all, they would say?",
  "58955": "Again?",
  "58956": "Isn't there any one amongst you all who can dance better than this fellow?",
  "58957": "He has not, has he?",
  "58958": "Are you in debt again?",
  "58959": "Which of them is it that you seek?",
  "58960": "Are the great old houses gaols?",
  "58961": "Did that other creature come to the same end?",
  "58962": "How much money have you?",
  "58963": "Had they conferred together?",
  "58964": "Now I am sure you can eat another breakfast?",
  "58965": "And my silliness is part of my charm?",
  "58966": "But we'll begin again, won't we?",
  "58967": "But how are you going to decide this for a nation?",
  "58968": "Archer?",
  "58969": "THAT wretched creature?",
  "58970": "Should I, who never do ill to any person, be the innocent means of doing it to my friends?",
  "58971": "What has he been doing all this time?",
  "58972": "Shall I, the queen, be able, then, to bear off no prize?",
  "58973": "Did you hear 'em shooting the cannon?",
  "58974": "Is it less than just that you should suffer as you have caused others to suffer?",
  "58975": "And what said the abbe?",
  "58976": "Would it do?",
  "58977": "Had all these houses sprung up overnight, and these streets been pushed across the meadows in a day?",
  "58978": "How was I to know?",
  "58979": "And what is the real cost of the land?",
  "58980": "Would it not be better to send him abroad at once?",
  "58981": "Do you wish it?",
  "58982": "Husband come back?",
  "58983": "Who triumphs now?",
  "58984": "And who was the lady?",
  "58985": "Why are you silent?",
  "58986": "Is it right then that the rich, the few, should have the supreme power?",
  "58987": "Where will you be safe?",
  "58988": "Do?",
  "58989": "Do I make it clear?",
  "58990": "Even hating?",
  "58991": "Are you sure, sir?",
  "58992": "Is that all you want?",
  "58993": "Well, what have you to say?",
  "58994": "How do you dare to disturb me in the exercise of my functions?",
  "58995": "But what manner of man is he, lad?",
  "58996": "What can we do to raise your spirits, dear mama?",
  "58997": "Did he do it?",
  "58998": "And the boy is dying, you say?",
  "58999": "Don't you understand how I want you for my wife?",
  "59000": "And the chariot?",
  "59001": "How long ago was it?",
  "59002": "Why do you wander so much in it yourself if you so dislike it?",
  "59003": "What in the world for?",
  "59004": "What sort of instances do you mean?",
  "59005": "Why tarry we?",
  "59006": "Word of honor?",
  "59007": "How, so looking, can she pass unnoticed?",
  "59008": "Who was that came in?",
  "59009": "Do you mean that he has deserted his daughter?",
  "59010": "What movement was ever spontaneous in any true sense of the word?",
  "59011": "Who has not an ass's ears?",
  "59012": "Ah, if only he would have made this demand of her?",
  "59013": "What is your name, then?",
  "59014": "Sixteen leagues?",
  "59015": "Are the lads asleep?",
  "59016": "Why, child?",
  "59017": "And can all this be true, think you?",
  "59018": "Would not one say he was speaking of a religious community?",
  "59019": "Were they permitted to indulge these cannibal propensities at the expense, not of the flocks, but of the shepherds of the provinces?",
  "59020": "Why, whatever is the matter, my dearest?",
  "59021": "What else could she spect on him?",
  "59022": "How can it be otherwise?",
  "59023": "Where is my wife?",
  "59024": "What have ye, brothers?",
  "59025": "Come, it is worth thinking about?",
  "59026": "Did I?",
  "59027": "How does he expect us to work for him if he won't stump up?",
  "59028": "What, in the name of peace, do you mean?",
  "59029": "Jane, will you have a flower?",
  "59030": "Now, then, what do you want?",
  "59031": "Shall we go and sit outside on the terrace?",
  "59032": "What is the evidence he produces?",
  "59033": "CAN anyone be unhappy, really?",
  "59034": "Whither does that way go?",
  "59035": "Come now, will you answer?",
  "59036": "But, monsieur, how can I thank you for the great kindness you have done me?",
  "59037": "How much do you expect to be paid, sir, for this picture of my girl?",
  "59038": "Are you guilty, or not guilty?",
  "59039": "Who is th' other four?",
  "59040": "Outside the pale of that holy thing, justice, by what right does one form of man despise another?",
  "59041": "Moved again?",
  "59042": "Had she understood?",
  "59043": "How would you have had it?",
  "59044": "How long is it since I went down?",
  "59045": "You know me, then?",
  "59046": "What is the cost, sir?",
  "59047": "Have I ever refused my duty, sir?",
  "59048": "What do I here seek?",
  "59049": "You cannot then confide in the nature of my wishes?",
  "59050": "Would you have had me, sir?",
  "59051": "Did you make my gruel?",
  "59052": "Why don't your juries hang murderers?",
  "59053": "I helped her to escape?",
  "59054": "And the anticipations of future pleasures and pains are of a like nature?",
  "59055": "Is there anything in the character of the accused persons which makes the accusation probable?",
  "59056": "Didn't I take up his name a dozen times in the last month?",
  "59057": "Can you recollect all that?",
  "59058": "And why cannot I reconcile myself to the prospect of death?",
  "59059": "Can he stand that ordeal?",
  "59060": "And where is this signature?",
  "59061": "And your reason?",
  "59062": "As an adventuress, or by chance meetings?",
  "59063": "Well, how about the little jaunt?",
  "59064": "What's to prevent our having a person that we CAN depend upon, and enjoying the delight of doing a good action at the same time?",
  "59065": "Really, then?",
  "59066": "Practise meditation?",
  "59067": "If you'll forgive my leaving you now?",
  "59068": "Could you have a motive for the trust, that was not honourable and flattering to me?",
  "59069": "How could springs break through such walls as these?",
  "59070": "No, why disturb the old fellow?",
  "59071": "Why shouldn't I go?",
  "59072": "And now did it all end in those ravings of hate, and in that glazing gaze of terror?",
  "59073": "And what about the green mist?",
  "59074": "Where did you put it?",
  "59075": "Now, my friends, are any of you obtuse enough to swallow that?",
  "59076": "Do you not see those fierce young braves, who are watching to kill you?",
  "59077": "Do I perceive the whereabouts of the coach which I hear rattling by my window, or does reasoning play its part in giving me information?",
  "59078": "What would it matter if everybody knew it?",
  "59079": "How shall we find his where, and having found it, how can we destroy?",
  "59080": "Now stop quietly where you are, will you?",
  "59081": "Touchin, isn't it?",
  "59082": "Who will go with you?",
  "59083": "What was I asaying?",
  "59084": "Well, a cup of coffee, my friend?",
  "59085": "Didn't I tell you the truth now, when I said you were in love?",
  "59086": "Had she never asked the gardeners?",
  "59087": "What flowed from the first?",
  "59088": "And for how long?",
  "59089": "It's a pretty sort of thing that I should have to feed a great fellow like you, and never hope to get one penny for it, isn't it?",
  "59090": "May I ask those who have not differed with me to join with me in this same spirit towards those who have?",
  "59091": "What if I don't?",
  "59092": "Frank's position?",
  "59093": "Is this the worst fate you can think of for me?",
  "59094": "Are the other effigies, which are burned in the spring and midsummer bonfires, susceptible of the same explanation?",
  "59095": "Was it right to kiss his mother or wrong to kiss his mother?",
  "59096": "Whose, then?",
  "59097": "Suppose I say to a man, how much?",
  "59098": "Do you imagine that all those who came to flatter me were sincere?",
  "59099": "Can't you mend them?",
  "59100": "What is holding one's breath?",
  "59101": "I trust, monsieur, you come authorized to treat for the surrender of the place?",
  "59102": "And which are the soft or drinking harmonies?",
  "59103": "And have a highly respectable reference for everything, have you?",
  "59104": "Have you succeeded?",
  "59105": "My hay to supply all the farmers in the district?",
  "59106": "Why do you not take your chance and be arrested with me?",
  "59107": "What was his life?",
  "59108": "Why can't I go?",
  "59109": "What generally?",
  "59110": "Shall the despair of success make me assert, that I am here possest of an idea, which is not preceded by any similar impression?",
  "59111": "But wherefore all this labour, all this strife?",
  "59112": "It is rather, isn't it?",
  "59113": "What is this folly?",
  "59114": "And after that?",
  "59115": "Did he, my dear?",
  "59116": "Man or woman, pray, sir?",
  "59117": "Brackish or salt?",
  "59118": "Who is come?",
  "59119": "But the beasts are better than the people, and why should they not have all the good things the people have?",
  "59120": "So you're not angry with me?",
  "59121": "Who are they?",
  "59122": "Had she not seen at a glance that his love tirade was worthy of ridicule, and of no other notice?",
  "59123": "Here, sire?",
  "59124": "How is your little affair coming along?",
  "59125": "Now, is it?",
  "59126": "When the eve is cool?",
  "59127": "Had I first sought after his mistress?",
  "59128": "He would not take them?",
  "59129": "What talk is this?",
  "59130": "And, if the moon is lighter than the other elements why is it opaque and not transparent?",
  "59131": "But you don't mean to say you would insist on my waiting months for the sake of clothes?",
  "59132": "Do you permit us to open this casket?",
  "59133": "Will you refuse me?",
  "59134": "What do you call this or that?",
  "59135": "Me?",
  "59136": "What was your opinion, monsieur?",
  "59137": "Is it agreed?",
  "59138": "What is to be expected of, or by, such profligates?",
  "59139": "Are ye going to let that rascal beat ye?",
  "59140": "What are you in a fright about now?",
  "59141": "Why, hain't you been talking about my coming back, and all that stuff, as if I'd been gone away?",
  "59142": "Is it not best for it to do so?",
  "59143": "When does the porter open that door?",
  "59144": "The government's?",
  "59145": "Who do you mean?",
  "59146": "Say, sir?",
  "59147": "Shall it be in here, or out on the grass?",
  "59148": "Impossible?",
  "59149": "And isn't there marvellous scenery?",
  "59150": "Is that your name?",
  "59151": "Was there nothing to identify this man?",
  "59152": "Have you kitchens here?",
  "59153": "Me?",
  "59154": "What was I saying?",
  "59155": "Yes, what about them?",
  "59156": "How do you expect me to find any if I hide in the woods?",
  "59157": "What did he say in his last hours?",
  "59158": "Of what materials can that heart be composed, which can melt when insulted, and instead of revolting at injustice, kiss the rod?",
  "59159": "Who was her mother?",
  "59160": "Heard what?",
  "59161": "May I ask you to be so good as to leave this room?",
  "59162": "What do you see in her out of the way?",
  "59163": "Do you mean to insinuate I've got toes, you unnatural wretch?",
  "59164": "Do you yet doubt?",
  "59165": "Shall I give you an illustration?",
  "59166": "And have you those excellent receipts, madam, to keep yourselves from bearing of children?",
  "59167": "But how is there a session before the recent election returns are in?",
  "59168": "Well, what are you standing there for, you sca'cwow?",
  "59169": "It has more than one, then, miss?",
  "59170": "Much more, how comprehend his face, when face he has none?",
  "59171": "Well, and your wife?",
  "59172": "What desperate debt are you thinking of?",
  "59173": "What shall be the measure of retribution?",
  "59174": "Was it you answered me?",
  "59175": "Can it be sin to know?",
  "59176": "And that I there met with a very lucky chance?",
  "59177": "And you veiled it?",
  "59178": "That's another way of fighting, I suppose?",
  "59179": "But the writing?",
  "59180": "Of course, sir, you will begin soon to educate your son yourself?",
  "59181": "Did you observe any thing peculiar about it?",
  "59182": "If the act is not repealed, what do you think will be the consequences?",
  "59183": "Is it too late?",
  "59184": "Is it true?",
  "59185": "Would you deal lighter blows rather than heavier ones?",
  "59186": "Will you allow me to live there with them?",
  "59187": "What can you possibly want to know of circuses then?",
  "59188": "Have you got through all your work?",
  "59189": "And now will this attempt, unprecedented in the annals of travels, lead to any practical result?",
  "59190": "What portion awaited those enemies?",
  "59191": "But where is my court?",
  "59192": "Whence?",
  "59193": "With what intention?",
  "59194": "He'll simply, he'll insistently have lied?",
  "59195": "What does he want to advertise for?",
  "59196": "Has he been here since?",
  "59197": "But who may abide the day of his appearing?",
  "59198": "In falsetto?",
  "59199": "Will the best of those we bade come hither to this land?",
  "59200": "Think I'm afraid of such as you?",
  "59201": "But you, gentlemen, then, have never heard the catastrophe of the BRITANNIA, mentioned?",
  "59202": "Yes?",
  "59203": "Are you dying for him?",
  "59204": "You are not so bewitched, ma'am, are you, as to remain with him of your own accord?",
  "59205": "Did it lie in some tangled depth of philosophy?",
  "59206": "Who said that?",
  "59207": "In what place, sir?",
  "59208": "Will you not embrace it?",
  "59209": "Can you tell me where I could get employment of any kind?",
  "59210": "But what is temptation?",
  "59211": "Would you put tricks upon travellers?",
  "59212": "Do not you love him, madam?",
  "59213": "What will you give me if I deliver you from the sheep?",
  "59214": "Didn't I do that talk neat?",
  "59215": "Wish to tend to him?",
  "59216": "But what could she do?",
  "59217": "Isn't it splendid to think of all the things there are to find out about?",
  "59218": "Do you believe that he thinks of it much?",
  "59219": "Is this carriage for me?",
  "59220": "But what about her husband?",
  "59221": "Has the latter a right to prevent D from selling?",
  "59222": "Then, who taught you?",
  "59223": "You are happy?",
  "59224": "Before the end of the week?",
  "59225": "You say?",
  "59226": "How would ye rise high, if your fathers' will should not rise with you?",
  "59227": "Did you really think I was the kind of girl to roll about on the floor and whine for mercy?",
  "59228": "And again I ask, what is all this labor to do for you?",
  "59229": "You didn't suppose you were going away from me, did you?",
  "59230": "Say you so?",
  "59231": "Are you an independent woman?",
  "59232": "Unwell?",
  "59233": "And thy father's name?",
  "59234": "For which he was entered?",
  "59235": "In what respect had they differed from their neighbours?",
  "59236": "And why do you believe that?",
  "59237": "How do you know it is the doctor?",
  "59238": "O my brethren, is not everything AT PRESENT IN FLUX?",
  "59239": "Aren't you going to ask how your mamma is?",
  "59240": "What philosophy taught this doctrine?",
  "59241": "Did she really imagine that he and she could live like this?",
  "59242": "Have they sold me up, then?",
  "59243": "Can our gross feelings be excited by no other subjects than tragedy and suicide?",
  "59244": "Why, what but books can kill time until, at the age of forty, a lucky chance may permit me to kill something else?",
  "59245": "Where, citoyen?",
  "59246": "Why, did she swim in some special way, then?",
  "59247": "Do you think they do?",
  "59248": "When you were young?",

  "59648": "Talk?",
  "59649": "Ah, she has been injured then?",
  "59650": "How are you getting along?",
  "59651": "But if so, why do you degrade yourself to serve this dirty foreigner, when you at least saw the last of a genuine national gentry?",
  "59652": "Did no one hear him move?",
  "59653": "Do you hear me, sir?",
  "59654": "What are you plotting against me?",
  "59655": "Are we surprised that a multitude of proselytes should embrace the doctrine and the passions of an eloquent fanatic?",
  "59656": "Now, did you ever hear the like since you were born?",
  "59657": "What court?",
  "59658": "But what can be done about it?",
  "59659": "Has not the experience of centuries confirmed his opinion?",
  "59660": "And now that you understand the situation, what do you advise me to do?",
  "59661": "What is sadder than a dead house, with its skeleton standing bare and sinister?",
  "59662": "Besides, what trouble is there at all in doing this?",
  "59663": "Is it a job, or a boy at marbles?",
  "59664": "You found it?",
  "59665": "There are tints in the clouds this evening, violets and blues, which are very beautiful, are they not, my friend?",
  "59666": "To lie 'for' her?",
  "59667": "But such being the case, why should she take on herself to cater for the amusement of people of such degraded tastes?",
  "59668": "You remember the place, my father?",
  "59669": "Who has?",
  "59670": "A fish of the sea or river?",
  "59671": "Was the island still inhabited by the castaway to whose succor they had come?",
  "59672": "Well, sir?",
  "59673": "Why, what is the meaning of such desperate passions?",
  "59674": "Ah, why indeed?",
  "59675": "There are so many paths leading to heaven, who knows which is the right one?",
  "59676": "Can human nature be constructed on lines so insignificant?",
  "59677": "And after all, what harm does it do?",
  "59678": "Troop?",
  "59679": "Why should she answer any such question?",
  "59680": "And is the reason known?",
  "59681": "Why can't the woman leave us alone?",
  "59682": "But if she does, what can I say to her?",
  "59683": "How, master?",
  "59684": "I suppose you have your composition all done?",
  "59685": "And are we come to that degree of misery, that our enemies themselves are expected to pity us?",
  "59686": "What did he do after he had wept?",
  "59687": "'If' you've been mistaken, you say?",
  "59688": "Isn't it good?",
  "59689": "And what should I do with these?",
  "59690": "When do you think he ever told her that before?",
  "59691": "Would you come round with me to the registry office?",
  "59692": "But who are these strangers with you?",
  "59693": "And why is he doing this to me?",
  "59694": "Why, what age do you call that little creature?",
  "59695": "What sort of a new life can you and I look forward to?",
  "59696": "Why didn't you go down yesterday?",
  "59697": "Missis has got dem bills?",
  "59698": "What's that after his name?",
  "59699": "What are you laughing at?",
  "59700": "First, will your ladyship allow me to ask you whether you have had any strange visitors this morning?",
  "59701": "But who will assert, that this is the only foundation of justice?",
  "59702": "Is it far off?",
  "59703": "Are you less cold now?",
  "59704": "How many steps have you told?",
  "59705": "Is it the form of the thing?",
  "59706": "Do the buyers pay before they bring away the things?",
  "59707": "How, my fault?",
  "59708": "Where did ye get your finishing, my dear?",
  "59709": "And the meal?",
  "59710": "What have I done, that I should be the only mark of your cruelty?",
  "59711": "Was there no one in the churchyard?",
  "59712": "Well, what would she have now?",
  "59713": "What trick is this?",
  "59714": "Are the guns ready?",
  "59715": "Will you be so good as to pledge me, sir?",
  "59716": "With her?",
  "59717": "Where is the key you speak of?",
  "59718": "But where are the antennæ you spoke of?",
  "59719": "When did you come back?",
  "59720": "Not an ill wind, I hope?",
  "59721": "Eustacia?",
  "59722": "As you truly say, if we were to act in this way, what would the world come to?",
  "59723": "Oh, where shall we meet?",
  "59724": "Well, have you sent?",
  "59725": "Or why should it be forbidden that he gaze upon the sea?",
  "59726": "If I had one that I could and ought to have revealed, should I not have long ago divulged it?",
  "59727": "How can one say what seed of good may have been dropped into his soul, never to die?",
  "59728": "Do you preach them?",
  "59729": "Would you like to be a lovely young girl?",
  "59730": "Where should they go?",
  "59731": "Why such a terrible misfortune?",
  "59732": "What should he do about his skimming?",
  "59733": "How much did the stiff have in his bags?",
  "59734": "Why won't you tell me?",
  "59735": "You have tried to find him, then?",
  "59736": "Which side of his life did he resolve upon closing and condemning?",
  "59737": "And what is the name which the city derives from the possession of this sort of knowledge?",
  "59738": "What do you call him again?",
  "59739": "What about the hole?",
  "59740": "At the oars?",
  "59741": "But to whom we are to assign these studies, and in what way they are to be assigned, are questions which remain to be considered?",
  "59742": "You think I'm afraid of you and your cattle, don't you?",
  "59743": "To you?",
  "59744": "What is this leather cleaned with?",
  "59745": "Whar is you?",
  "59746": "How can people be dissatisfied with anything?",
  "59747": "What's to become of us?",
  "59748": "That I loved you?",
  "59749": "Geraldine, do you remember that still?",
  "59750": "Why does the floor seem hollowed out at this spot?",
  "59751": "Sagacious too?",
  "59752": "Well, have you anything more?",
  "59753": "What's the difference?",
  "59754": "What does it matter whether I forgive you?",
  "59755": "But, that being so, why did you offer?",
  "59756": "Better turn to, now?",
  "59757": "How can I marry her?",
  "59758": "But who will she be?",
  "59759": "Then he is there?",
  "59760": "So you DON'T think them capable of inviting a man on the condition that he is to look sharp and die?",
  "59761": "Very young or very old?",
  "59762": "Shall I then conceal the cause of my distress, and not dare to seek aid and healing for my wound?",
  "59763": "And how do you propose to prove all this?",
  "59764": "Do you doubt it, my darling?",
  "59765": "Go out?",
  "59766": "Shall I ever behold her again?",
  "59767": "What city could be at rest, lawful, and orderly?",
  "59768": "And what happened?",
  "59769": "Who is he that interrupts our busines?",
  "59770": "What is any newspaper article but an expression of the views taken by one side?",
  "59771": "But what could have been his motive for sending the cup to me?",
  "59772": "Who, then, shall come in at this day and claim that he invented it?",
  "59773": "And why are children born to such men as you?",
  "59774": "But the mystery?",
  "59775": "And that fellow with her, eh?",
  "59776": "Why should these pages be stained by further crimes?",
  "59777": "Have I ever excused her for it?",
  "59778": "And where are you going now?",
  "59779": "You are going to her, I hope?",
  "59780": "But I am curious to know are you trying to make a convert of me or a pervert of yourself?",
  "59781": "Is it not just to yourself that you should, in a few public speeches, state your reasons, and thus justify yourself?",
  "59782": "What means that haggard face, cousin, and the collar of your dress is all wet?",
  "59783": "Have you persuaded your cousin?",
  "59784": "And now could it have been otherwise?",
  "59785": "Do you expect it?",
  "59786": "The cat?",
  "59787": "Was he redeeming his promise to be good?",
  "59788": "I should like to know in what I'm your inferior?",
  "59789": "Are you quite well?",
  "59790": "Who said he was to have six pound a year?",
  "59791": "Did he ever tell you he liked you?",
  "59792": "Why should you, who have already produced so many wonderful and charming compositions, still fatigue yourself with such close application?",
  "59793": "How can you think of dirt, with such objects before you?",
  "59794": "What are you jabbering about, shipmate?",
  "59795": "But is it that I have come to the wrong house, madam?",
  "59796": "Should he rejoin the army?",
  "59797": "Would you take my advice?",
  "59798": "And I caught it, mamma, don't you remember?",
  "59799": "Has the poor lad a sister?",
  "59800": "I have come to ask if you would let me stay with you?",
  "59801": "I would only ask you now, sir, whether you have formed any explanation in your own mind as to the mysterious disappearance of your son?",
  "59802": "And you, sir?",
  "59803": "You will, of course, dispose of it in some way or other?",
  "59804": "Why should we refuse to learn from anyone?",
  "59805": "Was that grapeshot?",
  "59806": "And, now, when are we to go?",
  "59807": "Or see him prisoner, and come back to tell it?",
  "59808": "Who will be open where there is no sympathy, or has call to speak to those who never can understand?",
  "59809": "You've seen how he's been opening his mouth against us again?",
  "59810": "But why in such a hurry?",
  "59811": "Any news?",
  "59812": "Could you put me in communication with your witty and agreeable friend?",
  "59813": "But shall I tell you who this young lady is?",
  "59814": "So then they'll arrest him?",
  "59815": "What is it that you are always muttering between your teeth?",
  "59816": "Do you believe we can become one nation?",
  "59817": "What size is a big wish?",
  "59818": "Ain't you the fellow that was put in command of these men?",
  "59819": "Will you now at last speak?",
  "59820": "Isn't that a poetical name?",
  "59821": "By whom is it commanded?",
  "59822": "And how much do you suppose was really expended for improvements during that four years?",
  "59823": "In the evening?",
  "59824": "Does night lose her eyes?",
  "59825": "May I not hope to see you again?",
  "59826": "If dissolved, how could another be collected?",
  "59827": "You remember that low parapet on the roof?",
  "59828": "Why can we not fly, my friends?",
  "59829": "Was I not going to embark with forty men, and I have now reduced them to twenty for an equal success?",
  "59830": "Shall we go and sit in the cathedral?",
  "59831": "Not in his usual spirits?",
  "59832": "Are the study windows visible from there?",
  "59833": "Ye that love us, can ye move us?",
  "59834": "How should I deny aught to her that I bear in my heart?",
  "59835": "Aren't you never going to speak to me any more?",
  "59836": "There, child, what do you think of that little vase?",
  "59837": "Is he gone?",
  "59838": "Don't you think it is?",
  "59839": "And who could it be who was her confederate?",
  "59840": "What's your name, you hardened scoundrel?",
  "59841": "Why such a profound mystery?",
  "59842": "And what are we doing with our money?",
  "59843": "How d'you think I'm looking?",

  "59850": "Well, what has that to do with it?",
  "59851": "Left 'em?",
  "59852": "May it not be about that cursed affair?",
  "59853": "How can it become an organic law of society?",
  "59854": "What on earth made you go there?",
  "59855": "What, too, of her wonderful and awful loveliness?",
  "59856": "The whole period of threescore years and ten is surely but a little thing in comparison with eternity?",
  "59857": "You are afraid of ghosts?",
  "59858": "But, before you go, will you, for a moment, steadily attend to me?",
  "59859": "I never knowed it by that name but what does th' name matter?",
  "59860": "Say what bring ye here?",
  "59861": "I say, would you mind coming at once?",
  "59862": "Would not love see returning penitence afar off, and fall on its neck and kiss it?",

  "59867": "DEAD, when?",
  "59868": "This young boarder of yours, has she tried to fly?",
  "59869": "What are we scared at and of whom are we afraid?",
  "59870": "What do you wish for?",
  "59871": "Now, policeman, what is this?",
  "59872": "Sure, what's the difference?",
  "59873": "Well, have you had a chat?",
  "59874": "Shall we go in now?",
  "59875": "Will they doubt that the philosopher is a lover of truth and being?",
  "59876": "For who is better able to direct my hesitation, or to instruct my ignorance?",
  "59877": "But why not after?",
  "59878": "Do you think you could?",
  "59879": "Who's that, then?",
  "59880": "Shall I lock the door again?",
  "59881": "Would not that dress please you?",
  "59882": "I wish to know also where you come from and to what place you are going?",
  "59883": "What do you say to a game of backgammon?",
  "59884": "Did you ever hitherto find me in the confraternity of the faulty?",
  "59885": "How would you set about it?",
  "59886": "What in the nation can he DO with it?",
  "59887": "Not indigenous?",
  "59888": "That's so?",
  "59889": "What else did he say?",
  "59890": "It was impossible?",
  "59891": "Shall we speak of the terms?",
  "59892": "This is the third time, and who knows what luck you may have?",
  "59893": "Now, whither went they with the cub?",
  "59894": "Is ours a lower order of people?",
  "59895": "Where WOULD it be?",
  "59896": "How many folks would eat your candy if they knew you handled it over before you washed your hands?",
  "59897": "Then will you give me an order that will enable me to see her?",
  "59898": "What do you think of it?",
  "59899": "What harm can a naked frog do us?",

  "61244": "Would you go with him?",
  "61245": "Who comes hither, among the beasts and dangers of the wilderness?",
  "61246": "Did it give him nothing?",
  "61247": "Which weighs most, water when frozen or when not frozen?",
  "61248": "Have you informed the sender?",
  "61249": "Why, papa, what is the matter?",
  "61250": "I may now perhaps mention what I wished to say to you?",
  "61251": "I love bright red drinks, don't you?",
  "61252": "What's gone with that boy, I wonder?",
  "61253": "Is not his authority of power to give our scene approbation?",
  "61254": "And what are this gentleman's commands with me?",
  "61255": "What do you mean by ambitious?",
  "61256": "And if I do it for him, what do you think he's promised me?",
  "61257": "And did you not tell him to go back?",
  "61258": "I hope that I make it all plain?",
  "61259": "And is the soul seen or not seen?",
  "61260": "Can you tell me where I am?",
  "61261": "Will you please be silent?",
  "61262": "Your hour?",
  "61263": "How long am I to wait?",
  "61264": "How did it happen that such a man had not been brought before a provost's court, on the return of the legitimate princes?",
  "61265": "Am I a captive?",
  "61266": "It was real, then?",
  "61267": "Is it a year, or more, or less?",
  "61268": "Why not possible?",
  "61269": "Would you want to hesitate, do you want to wait any longer?",
  "61270": "What is then left of us?",
  "61271": "Where did he get it?",
  "61272": "And not heard from her, eh?",
  "61273": "I merely say, with quite another view, you are probably aware I have some property to bequeath to my child?",
  "61274": "Yes, do you mean a change of heart?",
  "61275": "Had he not broken the ribs of a gamekeeper who abused him for having, gun in hand, passed through a neighbor's property?",
  "61276": "Surrender her to YOU?",
  "61277": "Who, then, has so correctly informed you?",
  "61278": "Sir, what have I done to dissatisfy you?",
  "61279": "Well, have you heard the great news?",
  "61280": "Do you remember the nights in the bedroom?",
  "61281": "Can't you tell us more about what happened?",
  "61282": "How much longer is he to bide here?",
  "61283": "What is all this?",
  "61284": "Would you drop the war where it is?",
  "61285": "Upon your honor?",
  "61286": "Why stop them?",
  "61287": "What if he gave me a place near him?",
  "61288": "Where would he naturally go?",
  "61289": "What is a sensitive person?",
  "61290": "Don't you want some, too?",
  "61291": "Does he think it's manly, to torture a horse?",
  "61292": "What is the matter with you today?",
  "61293": "Why he not help my papa?",
  "61294": "Shall I come for a walk with you tonight when I've put the children to bed?",
  "61295": "What have I deserved for my sins but hell and everlasting fire?",
  "61296": "And how about food?",
  "61297": "Why in good thunderation can't you be more easy?",
  "61298": "What's that for?",
  "61299": "Two?",
  "61300": "But how will you bestow your time, when you will have no visits to receive or pay?",
  "61301": "Then they allow the lackey to remain with him?",
  "61302": "How long ago is it?",
  "61303": "Well, so much being disposed of, what is left?",
  "61304": "But is it him indeed?",
  "61305": "What is it you fear?",
  "61306": "I hope 'tis coming to something?",
  "61307": "How d'ye do, boy?",
  "61308": "Spilett?",
  "61309": "May I go with you, father?",
  "61310": "Whoever heard of a man sending for the police against himself?",
  "61311": "Will he have a grain of respect for you?",
  "61312": "How are the rest of your affairs progressing, apart from the business?",
  "61313": "Did master say so his own self?",
  "61314": "But if you don't know this woman, how do you know her name?",
  "61315": "Sir, are you here?",
  "61316": "Can't we go now?",
  "61317": "But in extreames what patience shall I vse?",
  "61318": "How is my heart still moved when I think of your goodness?",
  "61319": "A lord?",
  "61320": "Do you leave me?",
  "61321": "Whether advocates and orators had liberty to plead in causes manifestly known to be unjust, vexatious, or oppressive?",
  "61322": "Where are you going, marechal?",
  "61323": "Who could hear unmoved of the fall of that which had been so great, and which had stood so long?",
  "61324": "Did he wish to wait until night, and leave the submarine passage secretly?",
  "61325": "Is there anything more?",
  "61326": "Because you're so sure he so really wants my company?",
  "61327": "Do you particularly object to ladies studying?",
  "61328": "And you have given up your cathedral work here?",
  "61329": "Am I to govern by another's will?",
  "61330": "What is it now?",
  "61331": "Vill they make ready to kill 'im?",
  "61332": "Why didn't you come in?",
  "61333": "What of this kingdom?",
  "61334": "So we may not enter into transgression?",
  "61335": "He won't be in the way, will he?",
  "61336": "Who dares mock at him?",
  "61337": "And these other people?",
  "61338": "But where are these latter stepping?",
  "61339": "But who made all those worlds, beaming so gloriously above us?",
  "61340": "Again, is not the passionate element wholly set on ruling and conquering and getting fame?",
  "61341": "You're sure it's far enough off?",
  "61342": "Would they live years and years if no one helped them?",
  "61343": "Both them ar chaps parsons?",
  "61344": "May I depart, monseigneur?",
  "61345": "What, straight from the station to my house?",
  "61346": "How do you think these garments fit me?",
  "61347": "What is all this for?",
  "61348": "Will it seem odd if I ask?",
  "61349": "Who or what speaks?",
  "61350": "Tell me, mind you ever to have had a lover?",
  "61351": "Does that person want you?",
  "61352": "Will he explain it?",
  "61353": "Was he to be carried back by the wind which had blown him there?",
  "61354": "We shall be sitting down to eat in a minute, and it's a formal occasion, darling, isn't it?",
  "61355": "But shouldn't we feel more compassion for the victims of crime than for those who commit crime?",
  "61356": "What is to be done then?",
  "61357": "Can't I do what I like with him?",
  "61358": "Where is a candle?",
  "61359": "May they not have believed, in fact, that it was a plant fallen from the sky, a gift of the divinity?",
  "61360": "Hearty, I thank you, said he, how be you?",
  "61361": "Whuzya think, hey?",
  "61362": "And why, then, did you not refuse him?",
  "61363": "Are you my friend?",
  "61364": "But the point is, had he money?",
  "61365": "What does he say?",
  "61366": "Am I to go to him and make a deed of conveyance?",
  "61367": "What is its consistency, if it extends many million miles from the sun's surface?",
  "61368": "Have you any one to depend on for assistance?",
  "61369": "What was the meaning of that fatigue, my friend?",
  "61370": "Perhaps it was only a false alarm that troubled you, and the enemy are not advancing?",
  "61371": "But now, how do you arrange your documents?",
  "61372": "Or is it thy dewy hand the daisy tips?",
  "61373": "Jacob's?",
  "61374": "Can mortal man in aught thy durance ease?",
  "61375": "No one else in your room?",
  "61376": "In his inexperience, he now asked himself with terror what game the girl was playing?",
  "61377": "Monsieur does not postpone an interview through prudence?",
  "61378": "Looks as if she knew all about it, don't she?",
  "61379": "How can I want to quarrel with you?",
  "61380": "I hope the gentleman will understand that it isn't my fault, sir?",
  "61381": "Surely you don't think that it was I?",
  "61382": "Why had he disobeyed his father, who had been always so generous to him?",
  "61383": "Of what are you talking?",
  "61384": "What did you want?",
  "61385": "Beauty?",
  "61386": "Are there women or are there not?",
  "61387": "Set out?",
  "61388": "Yet did I not first roughly kiss her as we danced?",
  "61389": "Well, and what may you have to say against this name?",
  "61390": "How do you like them?",
  "61391": "And he who is not on a voyage has no need of a pilot?",
  "61392": "But who will lead?",
  "61393": "You'll get plenty of fresh air, won't you?",
  "61394": "But, my dear, is not this rather out of character?",
  "61395": "Or a woman?",
  "61396": "Well, if so, why do you object to my doing so?",
  "61397": "Are you the boy I've read of in the papers?",
  "61398": "Oh, what's wrong?",
  "61399": "What's the use?",
  "61400": "And if he let go his hold?",
  "61401": "In what way has it a tendency to prove that?",
  "61402": "Who is at the door other than he?",
  "61403": "Are you still resolved to accompany me?",
  "61404": "She's such a splendid woman, isn't she?",
  "61405": "What does he do?",
  "61406": "Why did you keep me waiting so long?",
  "61407": "Can I say of her innocent and girlish beauty, that it faded, and was no more, when its breath falls on my cheek now, as it fell that night?",
  "61408": "Do you know why?",
  "61409": "Why, what's the MATTER with you?",
  "61410": "My dear friend, what has happened?",
  "61411": "You had no idea of your impending good fortune, in those times?",
  "61412": "Nice?",
  "61413": "May its poppet come in and talk?",
  "61414": "And what was it this time last year?",
  "61415": "Don't you care for me at all?",
  "61416": "But what is theory?",
  "61417": "Are they an hereditary caste, a specially educated order, an elected class?",
  "61418": "Then, sir, you are satisfied?",
  "61419": "And what if he had?",
  "61420": "And why is he here?",
  "61421": "That is your final decision?",

  "61425": "What was the use of squandering the days of his youth in an office when the world was beautiful?",
  "61426": "But, tell me, have they all one motion, both situ et tempore?",
  "61427": "And you selected it yourself?",
  "61428": "I know it, but in asking for news, I mean, have you done anything for me?",
  "61429": "What on earth have I done now?",
  "61430": "When does it become an idolum specus, the unreasonable pertinacity of a too sceptical mind?",
  "61431": "When will he be here?",
  "61432": "Something extraordinary must await us farther on, but, what?",
  "61433": "When shall I wake?",
  "61434": "What had he come there to do?",
  "61435": "And how stands the fact?",
  "61436": "Do you ever work, child?",
  "61437": "You hear, sir?",
  "61438": "What would you do if you were in my place?",
  "61439": "The gentleman to whom I had the honour of being introduced?",
  "61440": "Not to see the father?",
  "61441": "Will you overlook it this once and forgive me, and let things go on as before?",
  "61442": "What am I to tell him?",
  "61443": "Won't you find it an awful nuisance to look after a baby?",
  "61444": "Where do you come from?",
  "61445": "And what did you say about it, bishop?",
  "61446": "Then why are we here, my friends?",
  "61447": "Boats in the royal service?",
  "61448": "What is your religion?",
  "61449": "Must it not, indeed, be told to the whole circle of her acquaintance before she could be made to stand all right with them?",
  "61450": "Verily, do I still live?",
  "61451": "All as it should be, is it not?",
  "61452": "Is that strong on him still?",
  "61453": "Do you want to go to all of them?",
  "61454": "What does tha' know about him?",
  "61455": "What shall I think of this?",
  "61456": "Come, now, what do you want?",
  "61457": "Daae not see you come down from your room by the curious road which you selected?",
  "61458": "But as a man of honor should answer another, tell me fairly, shall you pay these with the same punctuality?",
  "61459": "And when doth this take place?",
  "61460": "But his stables had been searched?",
  "61461": "But, it will be asked further, can I make any use of this conception and hypothesis in my investigations into the world and nature?",
  "61462": "Of his own desire?",
  "61463": "Why should anyone pay?",
  "61464": "What do you wish of me?",
  "61465": "Such work is healthy, isn't it, sir?",
  "61466": "Pay?",
  "61467": "Home?",
  "61468": "And when?",
  "61469": "Then why should he be persecuted?",
  "61470": "Does aught lie on it?",
  "61471": "That's frank, isn't it?",
  "61472": "Where have you sprung up from?",
  "61473": "To what class of society does he belong?",
  "61474": "How come?",
  "61475": "Where now are all your high resolves at last?",
  "61476": "And will no murmurs fill the courts above?",
  "61477": "When?",
  "61478": "Marriage?",
  "61479": "Then that is all quite settled, is it not?",
  "61480": "Who would be so likely to resent an insult offered to the old choir?",
  "61481": "Have you told master that you heard a laugh?",
  "61482": "Or cometh it in person?",
  "61483": "What more can we do?",
  "61484": "What in the world does the man mean?",
  "61485": "What does anybody want here?",
  "61486": "Why, do you know how pretty you are, child?",
  "61487": "Will you not allow that I have as much of the spirit of prophecy in me as the swans?",
  "61488": "Shall we wait, or shall we charge?",
  "61489": "Ere I was old?",
  "61490": "Do you know his man?",
  "61491": "Will you so?",
  "61492": "Who are the true martyrs, of those who are slain on my side, or on that of my enemies?",
  "61493": "Well, what hinders your sleeping?",
  "61494": "And you'll be my friend?",
  "61495": "May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?",
  "61496": "What do you mean to say?",
  "61497": "Ain't I a crow?",
  "61498": "How about prying?",

  "61501": "Qui est ton pere?",
  "61502": "Yea, why should his father let him, if it come to that?",
  "61503": "Briefly, what did you glean?",
  "61504": "Didn't you see the look in his eyes when he talked about her?",
  "61505": "Gone, you say she is?",
  "61506": "Why does there come an hour when one emerges from this azure, and why does life go on afterwards?",
  "61507": "What has broken your heart?",
  "61508": "Do you think you will find that spring soon?",
  "61509": "How was I?",
  "61510": "Why doesn't he come to the house?",
  "61511": "And why do the children, the grandchildren, all the descendants of the first parents always return here?",
  "61512": "By whom?",
  "61513": "But then, what?",
  "61514": "Arm's length?",
  "61515": "Him as wos dead?",
  "61516": "What is its object?",
  "61517": "Are we never to educate ourselves to foresee such dangers and to prevent them before they happen?",
  "61518": "Do ye not feel the thirst and the hot breath of her love?",
  "61519": "So that you may both get tipsy, is that it, and stay here gabbing all day?",
  "61520": "Why was she brought here?",
  "61521": "I, my lord?",
  "61522": "And don't you know that you are prettier than you ever were?",
  "61523": "Am I really wonderful?",
  "61524": "Well, was there?",
  "61525": "What is she sentenced to?",

  "61534": "What had she better do, or how was it expedient that she should treat him?",
  "61535": "The door key?",
  "61536": "Looked?",
  "61537": "What of that?",
  "61538": "Shall we let him in or not, if you are asleep?",

  "61544": "Who took any?",
  "61545": "Was he true to them?",
  "61546": "Why should he not?",
  "61547": "Afraid of being heard?",
  "61548": "Will this ever take place in reality?",
  "61549": "Don't you see the animal has been such an inveterate tippler that he has not only drunk the wine, but swallowed the bottle?",
  "61550": "What garden?",
  "61551": "Why should I go?",
  "61552": "On your life?",
  "61553": "No more?",
  "61554": "Is it you, sir?",
  "61555": "What did he mean by talking about favourites, then?",
  "61556": "You will wait for me, then?",
  "61557": "Was it through the chimney?",
  "61558": "But what can I do, sister?",
  "61559": "Well, are you coming?",
  "61560": "It was from your wife, we supposed?",
  "61561": "And had I wasted some of the best years of my life to obtain a shadow?",
  "61562": "It is, then, the cardinal's custom to walk in his orangery?",
  "61563": "Oh how great a confidence shall there be to the dying man whom no affection to anything detaineth in the world?",
  "61564": "He paid for them, did he not?",
  "61565": "And if the world perceives that what we are saying about him is the truth, will they be angry with philosophy?",
  "61566": "Can such men fall away from reality?",
  "61567": "Are those our barks, yonder?",
  "61568": "How dare you come here?",
  "61569": "What is a magician?",
  "61570": "Wots the consequence?",

  "61576": "Have you an invite too, doctor?",
  "61577": "Why did he wish it?",
  "61578": "And suppose she does not mind her p's and q's?",
  "61579": "What makes you say that?",
  "61580": "Excuse him?",
  "61581": "Wasn't I faithful?",
  "61582": "Can you get me the grammars if I promise to say it hereabout?",
  "61583": "Would he startle him with sudden fear?",
  "61584": "How would you like to come in on that with me?",
  "61585": "But are you flesh and blood?",
  "61586": "She's not in this house, for instance?",
  "61587": "Hoo be all wi' ye?",
  "61588": "What time do you get up to get breakfast?",
  "61589": "Well, and what do you mean to do with me?",
  "61590": "Why don't you get into touch?",
  "61591": "And you went asking money of him, or making talk of getting a wife would drive him from his farm?",
  "61592": "You include the grounds about the houses?",
  "61593": "What, then, remains?",

  "61607": "For what purpose are we come here?",
  "61608": "Good faith?",
  "61609": "Oh, don't you see how much nicer it would be if it was a secret?",
  "61610": "Confess what?",
  "61611": "Is this a time to be offering pardons, or renewing the long forgotten subjects of charters and taxation?",
  "61612": "Would you care to come and dine with me?",
  "61613": "What could she have done to you?",
  "61614": "And shall we begin at once?",
  "61615": "But would you be able for it, my boy?",
  "61616": "Surprised at this emphasis, I surveyed my valet, and, perceiving a wildness in his looks, asked if he had seen his grandfather's ghost?",
  "61617": "Get it ready, will you?",
  "61618": "But you could find out?",
  "61619": "Was she pretty?",
  "61620": "Or will he say that to abolish corruption is a bad thing?",
  "61621": "And why did the body conceal itself?",
  "61622": "Jo, how could you?",
  "61623": "Don't they say as there's somebody can strip it off him?",

  "61625": "What other possible reason could there have been for her so blushing ?",
  "61626": "What made him seek this quarter of the house at an untimely season, when he should have been asleep in bed?",
  "61627": "Where can they have crossed?",
  "61628": "If such things are done in the green wood, what will be done in the dry?",
  "61629": "And whom he brought back this morning?",
  "61630": "Any references?",
  "61631": "Was not he believed to be dead?",
  "61632": "With whom are you going to fight?",
  "61633": "Then don't you despair?",
  "61634": "And why think you that will make him sad?",
  "61635": "But when will you come and see my study?",
  "61636": "My friends, why with us?",
  "61637": "What a carriage that was, and where did it come from, eh?",
  "61638": "But is that all your evidence?",
  "61639": "Why did you give him six pistoles?",
  "61640": "You deny it?",
  "61641": "How long does the incredulity with which I hear a new theory propounded continue to be a wise and salutary incredulity?",
  "61642": "Do you feel that you are a sufficiently practical man?",
  "61643": "How do you mean sad?",
  "61644": "What crime, then, have you committed?",
  "61645": "Did I tell you?",
  "61646": "Fwhat are you talkin' of?",
  "61647": "How could she, indeed?",
  "61648": "Don't you hear often?",
  "61649": "But, surely, there is some one in the world whom you love?",
  "61650": "And where is his corpse?",
  "61651": "Well, do you know what is taking place at this moment?",
  "61652": "And would you like to be here alone with her for a month?",
  "61653": "Isn't it a peacock?",
  "61654": "For instance, if you lived in the penal days?",
  "61655": "I say, what on earth's the matter?",
  "61656": "She has gone to visit friends?",
  "61657": "But why did men who were interpolating bronze corslets freely introduce bronze so seldom, if at all, as the material of greaves?",
  "61658": "And the men?",
  "61659": "Do you s'pose they would?",
  "61660": "Are you making fun of me?",
  "61661": "How could he possibly have doubted it?",
  "61662": "Who ever got a letter that was worth waiting for?",
  "61663": "What is your theory, then?",
  "61664": "You've come at last, have you?",
  "61665": "How may I tell you for what we were sunk here, when I do not know, unless it was because we were rich?",
  "61666": "But what good can one do oneself?",
  "61667": "And you're so great a favourite there, you say?",
  "61668": "Give up?",
  "61669": "Are you sure you wouldn't like some more breakfast?",
  "61670": "When shall I have you here again?",
  "61671": "If she's charming, how can she help it?",
  "61672": "And discarding all consideration of political consequences, what unspeakable personal glory there would then be to him as a man?",
  "61673": "You'll not tell, will you?",
  "61674": "How could she ever suppose such a thing?",
  "61675": "Was it the same desperate confusion, or would the ground offer better facilities?",
  "61676": "Kill that boy?",
  "61677": "Why, but will you leave him with so slight command, and infuse no more charge upon the fellow?",
  "61678": "Sherry or 'ock, sir?",
  "61679": "You have the unspeakable effrontery to stand there and admit it?",
  "61680": "True?",
  "61681": "Suppose now that by the light of the examples just offered we enquire who this imitator is?",
  "61682": "Very distant?",
  "61683": "Does his conscience ever entertain the question of his right to such subsidies?",
  "61684": "How shall I defile them?",
  "61685": "Can you strike a man to the heart and leave no mark on him?",
  "61686": "Do you know whence comes our real power?",
  "61687": "You don't suppose she could take any interest in you, do you?",
  "61688": "What's your hurry?",
  "61689": "If it be, how can that question have place, concerning the subsistence of self, under a change of substance?",
  "61690": "That?",
  "61691": "And in what light must I appear to the world?",
  "61692": "Marilla, have I really a pretty nose?",
  "61693": "On the other hand, what do we see?",
  "61694": "But what should we have been then?",
  "61695": "For are not milliners and mantuamakers reckoned the next class?",
  "61696": "She used to speak of me then?",
  "61697": "Could I ever forget?",
  "61698": "You think not, sir?",
  "61699": "Ran away with her?",
  "61700": "But do you?",
  "61701": "What sort of weather was it?",
  "61702": "And all for what?",
  "61703": "So that was the way they did it, eh?",
  "61704": "What admission?",
  "61705": "To make the people laugh?",
  "61706": "How can we get it?",
  "61707": "When shall we be governed?",
  "61708": "Does he think to reduce me by long absence?",
  "61709": "To enter in the wall?",
  "61710": "Is it important business?",
  "61711": "How dare you, sir, break it?",
  "61712": "You can think of, and remember her?",
  "61713": "Would you not sooner stay with me than with them?",
  "61714": "To whom, then?",
  "61715": "Do you fear that they might be stolen?",
  "61716": "Does she know it?",
  "61717": "What do you think of me?",
  "61718": "Who is it, and what's wanted?",
  "61719": "How it happened?",
  "61720": "What is it gives her the power to look down on everything, to be calm independently of everything?",
  "61721": "Tom, what is the matter?",
  "61722": "If upon the ocean, would any passing vessel be within hail to rescue them from their critical position?",
  "61723": "What is the use of your exertion, they would say, in accumulating wealth, which is doomed to melt away in the twinkling of an eye?",
  "61724": "But if you yourselves should be struck?",
  "61725": "Don't you see how his back is laden?",
  "61726": "Where shall the little boy ride to?",
  "61727": "And you owned up?",
  "61728": "Why did you, if you regret it?",
  "61729": "Now you know me, don't you?",
  "61730": "May I see if they have more scent than the others?",
  "61731": "To do what?",
  "61732": "Oh say, what sums that generous hand supply?",
  "61733": "You did at last?",
  "61734": "Hadn't we better go?",
  "61735": "But what must be done?",
  "61736": "Is there no wizardry within it?",
  "61737": "Davy?",
  "61738": "What position do you hold?",
  "61739": "Do you mean I'm to clean pots and pans and things?",
  "61740": "Why don't you go away with him?",
  "61741": "Is it empty?",
  "61742": "But how to get to him in safety?",
  "61743": "After all, thirty cents isn't much, eh what?",
  "61744": "Wouldn't you punish children at all, when they misbehaved?",
  "61745": "And why did he fire at us?",
  "61746": "Has he built one here, then?",
  "61747": "Will that satisfy you?",
  "61748": "Soft, who be these?",
  "61749": "What upon earth is to make them so?",
  "61750": "James's?",
  "61751": "Is your father in?",
  "61752": "Why were you treated so?",
  "61753": "And is that all, papa?",
  "61754": "Isn't that a nice imaginative name?",
  "61755": "The poorest?",
  "61756": "What's up now?",
  "61757": "You'll come out after supper, won't you?",
  "61758": "Don't you know the temptation to say frightful and shocking things just for the mere sake of saying them?",
  "61759": "You are going on a journey?",
  "61760": "You think it right, then, that your niece should throw herself in his way?",
  "61761": "Stronger then he was wont?",
  "61762": "And if you keep it under your skirts like that, who's to help tumbling?",
  "61763": "And the worthy man destroyed your compromising letter?",
  "61764": "Mary what, doctor?",
  "61765": "How can you say that, sir?",
  "61766": "Nay, why external for internal given?",
  "61767": "What would it profit a woman, for example, to get him a few months' imprisonment if her own ruin must immediately follow?",
  "61768": "What kind of people?",
  "61769": "And why did she weep so bitterly?",
  "61770": "Is this modesty?",
  "61771": "Whatever was it I was disputing about?",
  "61772": "Well now, what are you going to do about it?",
  "61773": "Indeed, who is free from them?",
  "61774": "Is this the way to the princesses' apartments?",
  "61775": "What have you been doing that you shouldn't?",
  "61776": "But why this singular vision, if the portrait is a faithful copy of the original?",
  "61777": "Tell me, if you please, what seems to cause you so much joy?",
  "61778": "But would you mind letting me hold your hand?",
  "61779": "Would he be in a position to marry?",
  "61780": "What about, sir?",
  "61781": "Then why go there?",
  "61782": "Has a crime been committed?",
  "61783": "Where should she turn for advice and counsel?",
  "61784": "Doctor, would it be proper to ask what is your secret?",
  "61785": "Do you like him any better?",
  "61786": "Was the lady crying?",
  "61787": "What's on your mind?",
  "61788": "Where are you going to?",
  "61789": "Will you make yourself known to me?",
  "61790": "There is one strange thing, do you know it?",
  "61791": "And you've not been anywhere this evening?",
  "61792": "What had she done to have deserved all this?",
  "61793": "But what about the fighting?",
  "61794": "You haven't any heart, have you?",
  "61795": "Is the fellow gone that brought this letter?",
  "61796": "What she?",
  "61797": "Tart of palate?",
  "61798": "And what made him drink?",
  "61799": "And what do you suppose it is?",
  "61800": "Why did you not come and speak to me in the room?",
  "61801": "Anthony, was it you?",
  "61802": "What I want to know is, where did he get that cheque?",
  "61803": "After dodging me for all these weeks and forcing me to climb the roof here like a tom cat and to come to see you as a doctor?",
  "61804": "Wasn't I telling you, and you a fine, handsome young fellow with a noble brow?",
  "61805": "Then to injure a friend or any one else is not the act of a just man, but of the opposite, who is the unjust?",
  "61806": "Who would say that, having come so far together, we will not go forward from here?",
  "61807": "What do you want with us?",
  "61808": "For has he not fine fences?",
  "61809": "Are they pretending?",
  "61810": "Why have I alluded to this man?",
  "61811": "Picrochole, my ancient friend of old time, of my own kindred and alliance, comes he to invade me?",
  "61812": "Does your explanation cover every point?",
  "61813": "Have you managed it?",
  "61814": "But whither?",
  "61815": "Ain't what's a man's wife's his?",
  "61816": "The verses accompanying this, may I beg you to take out of the tomb, and bring them to light in the 'Home journal?",
  "61817": "By whose authority?",
  "61818": "What will you say, then?",
  "61819": "Doen't I want you more now, than ever I did?",
  "61820": "What signifies my refusing?",
  "61821": "How could I have forgotten that?",
  "61822": "But what shall we do with the poor gentleman?",
  "61823": "And you intend to make him do it in the presence of two witnesses, do you?",
  "61824": "Will your majesty allow me one word of reply?",
  "61825": "You knew the pig?",
  "61826": "At whose hand?",
  "61827": "Why do you think that you are safer in this room than on the stage?",
  "61828": "Do you think it points to suicide?",
  "61829": "Know?",
  "61830": "Do you not know him, queen?",
  "61831": "How much?",
  "61832": "I wonder what that old man meant by his strange words?",
  "61833": "Did you see that woman who went by just now?",
  "61834": "It's not a matter of principle, but why should I go?",
  "61835": "How could I escape through these mighty walls?",
  "61836": "Are you in earnest or no?",
  "61837": "Would he ever live until then, with his strength ebbing away?",
  "61838": "Haf you got a new light for my cigar?",
  "61839": "Do you think that you could perform one more feat?",
  "61840": "What have been the results of your quarrel?",
  "61841": "How could it be?",
  "61842": "Then the superhuman and divine is absolutely incapable of falsehood?",
  "61843": "Are there no such things as pewter forks and spoons?",
  "61844": "Well, you know it's burned, so what's the use of talking?",
  "61845": "Don't I tell you he's provincial of the order now?",
  "61846": "Club?",
  "61847": "Does not this stream at our feet run toward the summer, until its waters grow salt, and the current flows upward?",
  "61848": "Is that my case?",
  "61849": "And you allowed it?",
  "61850": "For his own sake?",
  "61851": "And what are those studies, if I may presume to ask?",
  "61852": "What sort of things do YOU remember best?",
  "61853": "What does that mean?",
  "61854": "And of what did he die?",
  "61855": "Why am I always to be worried?",
  "61856": "You've seen a lot of trouble, sir, eh?",
  "61857": "How did you know it?",
  "61858": "Is that it?",
  "61859": "When shall we see each other?",
  "61860": "Why, have you got something the matter with you?",
  "61861": "Your son?",
  "61862": "What terrible step might she not take to effect her wishes?",
  "61863": "You're quite sure it's all right for you?",
  "61864": "And ought she to regard me as a friend?",
  "61865": "Where must I look?",
  "61866": "HOW'D you come?",
  "61867": "How could he get the school shopkeepers into trouble by owning that they let some of the boys go on tick with them?",
  "61868": "But how could I?",
  "61869": "What are your commands, lieutenant?",
  "61870": "Do you think he games at all?",
  "61871": "Why should I have dreaded it?",
  "61872": "After having once received the human organism, why should a soul choose to go back to the lesser and more imperfect organism of an animal?",
  "61873": "You will not go, then?",
  "61874": "Each day?",
  "61875": "Why don't you rent a furnished room and leave them in that for a week?",
  "61876": "But what is there to oblige him to reply?",
  "61877": "What have you two been doing now?",
  "61878": "Why is it you have earth that's not sifted?",
  "61879": "Why had he suggested a dinner party?",
  "61880": "But is he near at hand?",
  "61881": "Is there a man or a voman in this valley vat does not know it?",
  "61882": "What fortune?",
  "61883": "D'ye think 'twill hurt me?",
  "61884": "My soule?",
  "61885": "What could they take from me?",
  "61886": "Didn't you see anything in the corner, on the left, on the third shelf?",
  "61887": "Do you feel the earth tremble?",
  "61888": "Yet indeed, what was I to him?",
  "61889": "Have you no idea of the existence of spirits superior to either man or beast?",
  "61890": "Orpheus ?",
  "61891": "Have you lost anyone, my dear fellow?",
  "61892": "Must I go afoot?",
  "61893": "Why, is it late?",
  "61894": "And what will they burn instead of coal?",
  "61895": "What do they boil with 'em?",
  "61896": "Shall we, then, regard a hearty appetite as a curse, to be mitigated but not wholly neutralized by a series of good dinners?",
  "61897": "Know ye of it in this land?",
  "61898": "Nay, I beseech you, gentlemen, what means this?",
  "61899": "What makes my presence here so opportune?",
  "61900": "Had he bribed the agent?",
  "61901": "Do you think that I am in earnest?",
  "61902": "A marchioness?",
  "61903": "At home?",
  "61904": "Was it not so you were called when your honored brother married us?",
  "61905": "Where do you wish him to be?",
  "61906": "And that is your room up there?",
  "61907": "Where did he get his grasp upon affairs and his knowledge of men?",
  "61908": "Not violets?",
  "61909": "And how did you find him?",
  "61910": "Of the breaking up of the frozen sea in their displeasure?",
  "61911": "What are they, then, doctor?",
  "61912": "What business have you with luxuries of that kind?",
  "61913": "Isn't it a sickening FOOL ?",
  "61914": "I suppose you'll say there is nothing national about our literature either?",
  "61915": "Did he not excel in all the exercises and accomplishments proper to youth?",
  "61916": "What then will it be when it forms a judgment about anything aided by reason and deliberately?",
  "61917": "Who, my life?",
  "61918": "What would your aunt have said to it?",
  "61919": "Could he be certain that some conjuncture would not occur which would bring the mysterious personage on the scene?",
  "61920": "Surely that is all simple and obvious?",
  "61921": "What is it that drove you, impelled you, to separate yourself from the great natural path of marriage and the family?",
  "61922": "Could you tell me them, so that I can suit them to my purpose?",
  "61923": "You have nothing else to report to us before we go into this matter?",
  "61924": "So you're my nephew, are you?",
  "61925": "Has my horse had an extra feed?",
  "61926": "What, says I, have the galls been jiltin you?",
  "61927": "But why insult the poor, affront the great?",
  "61928": "WHY?",
  "61929": "Where you can be relieved?",
  "61930": "You know that they live securely and have nothing to apprehend from their servants?",
  "61931": "How dare you question me?",
  "61932": "Whence come you, sir?",
  "61933": "Damon, what is the matter with you, that you speak like that?",
  "61934": "May I help myself again?",
  "61935": "Why did he ride away before I had time to ask him how his lord and lady do I?",
  "61936": "And do not good practices lead to virtue, and evil practices to vice?",
  "61937": "What, haven't you seen her lately?",
  "61938": "How can you say I am harsh, you naughty fondling?",
  "61939": "And you would really wish me to marry this girl?",
  "61940": "What were you doing at the moment you were arrested?",
  "61941": "Oh, what made you?",
  "61942": "Had they found the life of the body after all?",
  "61943": "Have all these, your friends, been there?",
  "61944": "How do you all do?",
  "61945": "Had he abandoned the effort, or was he continuing his journey along the route agreed upon?",
  "61946": "Aren't you thinking of giving me any?",
  "61947": "Couldn't you try to reastralize them?",
  "61948": "I never made a fool of you, did I?",
  "61949": "If he were an assassin, would I save him?",
  "61950": "Whence, and what art you?",
  "61951": "What is the matter with you this morning?",
  "61952": "Why not end it all?",
  "61953": "What'll you take for that hide?",
  "61954": "And now, uncle, tell me where we are at the present moment?",
  "61955": "What were the causes of these events?",
  "61956": "What is it, my dear vicomte?",
  "61957": "What did you print last night?",
  "61958": "But why regard it as a crime, if they are sincere?",
  "61959": "Is it a criminal case?",
  "61960": "If I'm jealous, don't you see?",
  "61961": "Now, shall I get whatever I ask for?",
  "61962": "But how do you account for the fact that neither of the bodies have been recovered?",
  "61963": "Why don't you let her head that line?",
  "61964": "You mean they've done her in?",
  "61965": "Would you believe it?",
  "61966": "Ought the public, therefore, to give no attention, it may be asked, to the education of the people ?",
  "61967": "May I look at your translation?",
  "61968": "Do you really mean that things are not so desperate after all?",
  "61969": "Where is my wife?",
  "61970": "Don't you think his hair's growing?",
  "61971": "Is the right of succession a right of accumulation or only a right of choice?",
  "61972": "Shall I, daughter of a noble sire, suffer the worst indignity?",
  "61973": "Your niece, is she?",
  "61974": "Don't you think so, d'Artagnan?",
  "61975": "Do you think it will ever be in a settled state?",
  "61976": "Quite a child, isn't she?",
  "61977": "Where was this to end?",
  "61978": "Why are you so melancholy, brother?",
  "61979": "But let me see, how was it done?",
  "61980": "To what other?",
  "61981": "But we have no naval imagination, and who am I, that I should advance an opinion?",
  "61982": "Or to snare stags with cords and caltrops?",
  "61983": "Your husband?",
  "61984": "What is the matter up there?",
  "61985": "What was the huge ship he was approaching?",
  "61986": "But who do you think it is?",
  "61987": "What power had he, then?",
  "61988": "Yet what was he but certain?",
  "61989": "But the figures?",
  "61990": "Who will come to pick it up?",
  "61991": "What on earth has the prince got to do with it?",
  "61992": "Would you not like to come into the house?",
  "61993": "Where do you come from?",
  "61994": "I asked if his lord was stirring?",
  "61995": "It's so easy to be happy on a day like this, isn't it?",
  "61996": "Had he not everything which fathers want for portionless daughters, and uncles for dependant nieces?",
  "61997": "Had not your honor appointed to meet me in a week?",
  "61998": "Have they big boats to cross the ocean?",
  "61999": "Name of any collateral or remote branch of your ladyship's family?",
  "62000": "But next to you then, who is the strongest?",
  "62001": "How am I to understand you, monseigneur?",
  "62002": "Curse you?",
  "62003": "Were their faces set in the right or in the wrong direction?",
  "62004": "By the orders of the deputy procureur?",
  "62005": "Have you got the toothache?",
  "62006": "Had you begun to write it?",
  "62007": "Can you suppose there's any harm in looking as cheerful and being as cheerful as our poor circumstances will permit?",
  "62008": "Which nurse was that?",
  "62009": "Don't you see them?",
  "62010": "How are they to be governed?",
  "62011": "And you're not surprised?",
  "62012": "Why are you so cross?",
  "62013": "Can't I smell it?",
  "62014": "Will you see if that fellow has gone out?",
  "62015": "Oh, oh, so he has saved her life?",
  "62016": "Well, then, what would either of you gentlemen have done, if you had been in my position?",
  "62017": "Have I done so?",
  "62018": "And you, my dear boy?",
  "62019": "How in perdition can one do work when one hasn't had the proper training?",
  "62020": "How long must we still ride?",

  "62433": "I suppose they were government matches, then?",
  "62434": "You knew him?",
  "62435": "What was the fair lady's game?",
  "62436": "Is it war?",
  "62437": "You don't mean that seriously?",
  "62438": "I am still young, am I not?",
  "62439": "A great man?",
  "62440": "How did you get in if both houses were empty?",
  "62441": "Where could she be?",
  "62442": "Will you take me in your company?",
  "62443": "Isn't that so?",
  "62444": "How do you expect me to know such things?",
  "62445": "Then the just soul and the just man will live well, and the unjust man will live ill?",
  "62446": "And how does he clean the boots?",
  "62447": "Has C, a hatter, the right to force D, his neighbor and also a hatter, to close his shop, and cease his business?",
  "62448": "When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did they not lick his blood?",
  "62449": "Where do you land?",
  "62450": "And in that interval there has now been discovered something which we call opinion?",
  "62451": "Yet you cried out?",
  "62452": "Perhaps the other gentleman called, sir?",
  "62453": "Do you know what that is a warning of?",
  "62454": "Have you turned the case over in your mind?",
  "62455": "Why should I not confess it, gentlemen?",
  "62456": "Am I worse than I believe myself to be?",
  "62457": "How about moving that drugget?",
  "62458": "But you had a gun and bayonet besides?",
  "62459": "Do I sing?",
  "62460": "What do I want?",
  "62461": "What man?",
  "62462": "At good profit?",
  "62463": "Carton?",
  "62464": "And advancing?",
  "62465": "Can't we wait a few days?",
  "62466": "You are in mourning for some near relation?",
  "62467": "Do you know any who belong to the latter category?",
  "62468": "Now, what do you say about her doctor?",
  "62469": "Did your worship speak to me?",
  "62470": "Who are these people?",
  "62471": "Could it be an impartial one?",
  "62472": "What do you down here, my friend?",
  "62473": "Could he suspect my true identity?",
  "62474": "Don't know how old you are?",
  "62475": "And the women?",
  "62476": "Suppose I do not want to be happy, what is the source of the obligation?",
  "62477": "Or the generous deed out of selfishness?",
  "62478": "Were you sent here to praise me?",
  "62479": "How do you feel now, dear?",
  "62480": "She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?",
  "62481": "You know him, then?",
  "62482": "Will he always come when you call him?",
  "62483": "And what has that to do with me?",
  "62484": "Why compliment him on being a romantic reactionary aristocrat?",
  "62485": "In the first place, and before everything else, sir, is the news as bad in your opinion as I am asked to believe?",
  "62486": "But how was it that the grooms knew it?",
  "62487": "Will you appoint a meeting for six months hence?",
  "62488": "Find it easy?",
  "62489": "What is credit?",
  "62490": "Were they going over to the other side?",
  "62491": "So you will send me that book, dear count?",
  "62492": "But it's over now?",
  "62493": "Am I talking?",
  "62494": "And to what?",
  "62495": "Have I always hated you so much?",
  "62496": "How does he use it?",
  "62497": "You will sing with me?",
  "62498": "Grant?",
  "62499": "I say, you don't happen to have heard of a murder?",
  "62500": "What did I borrow?",
  "62501": "Am I not clearly designated in that, captain?",
  "62502": "And with what purpose could he do that?",
  "62503": "What is it that this polypragmonetic ardelion to all the fiends of hell doth aim at?",
  "62504": "What has happened that you should speak like that?",
  "62505": "What means, then, this dithyramb upon property?",
  "62506": "And where afterwards?",
  "62507": "What reason was there for assuming any probability of an uprising in the city?",
  "62508": "Is it not a canonical and authentic exception, worthy to be premised to all our undertakings?",
  "62509": "Ah, friends, what shall I do?",
  "62510": "Do we not both take from the poor people that which they can ill spare?",
  "62511": "What is the place, then, upon which we stand?",
  "62512": "Is he a man of fortune?",
  "62513": "How dare to repeat experiments that had failed so often?",
  "62514": "There is still another influence, what do you say to that?",
  "62515": "What makes you ask?",
  "62516": "Killed?",
  "62517": "See you not, you goblins, that your lord and master is here?",
  "62518": "Now, who can this other letter be from?",
  "62519": "But how is it he is not already returned?",
  "62520": "What is to be the manner of her death?",
  "62521": "Wizard?",
  "62522": "Then why have you endeavoured to assist him?",
  "62523": "And, conversely, that which has less of truth will also have less of essence?",
  "62524": "You mean that they would shipwreck?",
  "62525": "Didn't you yourself bring her the contract?",
  "62526": "Swinging by the chain?",
  "62527": "What put it into your head, little mother?",
  "62528": "You don't mean to say he's here?",
  "62529": "Then it is very thin wine?",
  "62530": "Did I offer to hit him or did I not?",
  "62531": "And what temperature may that be?",
  "62532": "Have you a pair of silent shoes?",
  "62533": "Who else should do so?",
  "62534": "And to what effect?",
  "62535": "I shall meet them there, and who knows what future advantages may result from the interview?",
  "62536": "Could it have been aught but a shipwreck which had drawn it under the water?",
  "62537": "The song?",
  "62538": "Shall you go?",
  "62539": "How are you, my dear?",
  "62540": "Ain't that a shame, sir?",
  "62541": "Why then not trace the rights of man to the creation of man?",
  "62542": "How did you know about it?",
  "62543": "What was the worthy geographer thinking of?",
  "62544": "How about that?",
  "62545": "Who knows it?",
  "62546": "You were alluding to the jerking movement of my hand every time I try to reach for anything?",
  "62547": "What the devil was you afraid of?",
  "62548": "What did he do before he went?",
  "62549": "Your alphabet?",
  "62550": "What's up?",
  "62551": "Which house is that?",
  "62552": "What's your real name?",
  "62553": "Why were they so strangely silent?",
  "62554": "Is it an amusing story?",
  "62555": "You were, were you not?",
  "62556": "Do you find the answer?",
  "62557": "At last she is dead?",
  "62558": "Do you mean to say you couldn't love me then?",
  "62559": "Don't you hear to what soft whispers the wind has fallen?",
  "62560": "Time to start?",
  "62561": "Wasn't it as good as a marriage?",
  "62562": "You understand?",
  "62563": "But how did you know that I was a prisoner back there?",
  "62564": "Wherein?",
  "62565": "Which do you prefer?",
  "62566": "What can be more gratifying than such a retrospect as this?",
  "62567": "What did she say?",
  "62568": "Oh, indeed?",
  "62569": "Besides, which am I to choose?",
  "62570": "Go to?",
  "62571": "But how could I, a poor dazed village lad, avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best and wisest of men fall every day?",
  "62572": "Well, why not?",
  "62573": "What does it all mean?",
  "62574": "I may assume that there is a second to be mentioned?",
  "62575": "And it's a very pretty name, don't you think?",
  "62576": "Your father is dead?",
  "62577": "Of whom?",
  "62578": "Natasha, you would not deceive me?",
  "62579": "What were you doing in the battle, my friend?",
  "62580": "But does not this expose himself more than me?",
  "62581": "And is not this the reason why of old love has been called a tyrant?",
  "62582": "What are you doing here?",
  "62583": "Why not take a number of banths and set them loose before us above ground?",
  "62584": "How long did he wear it?",
  "62585": "Is he not a prey which will always be within your grasp?",
  "62586": "What instructing do you think I should do?",
  "62587": "What took her away?",
  "62588": "Yes, how long?",
  "62589": "Is it not the separation of soul and body?",
  "62590": "It is said to have been a congestion of the brain, or apoplexy, which is the same thing, is it not?",
  "62591": "Executions?",
  "62592": "Have commissioned you to tell me what you have just stated?",
  "62593": "Remorse or regret?",
  "62594": "How am I to describe it?",
  "62595": "Tulkinghorn?",
  "62596": "Why are you smiling, prince?",
  "62597": "And if he had not, why did he take her again?",
  "62598": "That is your intention, is it not?",
  "62599": "Will it pass?",
  "62600": "Why did you pick him?",
  "62601": "Do you suppose these stoneless mounds hide no dust of what were men just as good?",
  "62602": "Where are those passionate eyes that appeal'd to my eyes in passion?",
  "62603": "What is it that you say you are going to do?",
  "62604": "What did she send?",
  "62605": "For you surely would not regard the skilled mathematician as a dialectician?",
  "62606": "Should he find him at all?",
  "62607": "Why should I meddle?",
  "62608": "The earlier it might be, would it not be better?",
  "62609": "The theories say that, do they?",
  "62610": "And what hope was there that these designs would fail?",
  "62611": "Not from the photos I have showed you?",
  "62612": "Have you ever noticed that the ones we would love the most distractedly are those whom we never meet to know?",
  "62613": "Well, then, my lord, say, are you satisfied?",
  "62614": "Gentlemen, do you stare?",
  "62615": "Well, what do you want?",
  "62616": "Why, monsieur, what secret can you expect to find in the hollow head of a soldier?",
  "62617": "Are you going to return there?",
  "62618": "What need has it of exaggeration?",
  "62619": "What if she loves you now better than anyone?",
  "62620": "Do you happen to know any one in this neighbourhood who would receive him for a while on my paying for him beforehand?",
  "62621": "He has done his best, but what does a fish's best come to when the fish is out of water?",
  "62622": "You are a reactionary, then?",
  "62623": "What's up, anyhow?",
  "62624": "Will there, indeed?",
  "62625": "Who drove you to it?",
  "62626": "We being strangers here, how dare you trust so great a charge from your own custody?",
  "62627": "You are a wheelwright?",
  "62628": "Does that suit you?",
  "62629": "Is anything the matter, aunt?",
  "62630": "But did be profess any attachment?",
  "62631": "Who are you, madame?",
  "62632": "Did you ever taste beer?",
  "62633": "Boomer?",
  "62634": "Does he mean to say that?",
  "62635": "Didn't you get my last letter?",
  "62636": "Don't you see you are not wanted here?",
  "62637": "How much fudder is got for go?",
  "62638": "I say, did you mean it the other day that you wouldn't marry me if I asked you?",
  "62639": "Is anyone up in your house?",
  "62640": "Will that suit you?",
  "62641": "Have I not explained your wishes, grandpapa?",
  "62642": "Did you see it?",
  "62643": "And, to be frank, my lord, was I wrong?",
  "62644": "From what?",
  "62645": "How was he to meet his lawyer?",
  "62646": "Herod?",
  "62647": "Cautious, why so?",
  "62648": "Was it the better to deceive them both?",
  "62649": "Why can't I?",
  "62650": "Did you tell us?",
  "62651": "Do you understand what you have done to me?",
  "62652": "Nor church?",
  "62653": "Does it end with just our two selves?",
  "62654": "Will there be beds for me and all who seek?",
  "62655": "But it's SOMEBODY'S plates, ain't it?",
  "62656": "What virtue will there be then, said the monk, in their bullets of concupiscence, their habits and their bodies?",
  "62657": "How do I know?",
  "62658": "In what direction?",
  "62659": "And of such a man too?",
  "62660": "What good am I here?",
  "62661": "Do you mean what did I say?",
  "62662": "What did the whole world matter to them?",
  "62663": "You feel some pretty well now?",
  "62664": "The man says?",
  "62665": "How should I make a mistake?",
  "62666": "Will you have hash or fishballs for breakfast?",
  "62667": "Won't you come again to see me?",
  "62668": "What signifies?",
  "62669": "Did she mean to go out?",
  "62670": "Where is she?",
  "62671": "Do you know where they came from?",
  "62672": "Did you see him come out on us?",
  "62673": "Why lie awake nights worrying about this?",
  "62674": "And if I did not obey his call, who could answer for what might happen?",
  "62675": "Or worse than the parts they acted require?",
  "62676": "What did you go out for?",
  "62677": "Well, then, what's the sense in wasting the plates?",
  "62678": "Aren't you very tired?",
  "62679": "Have you not lately renewed your promise?",
  "62680": "Whose are these beautiful green meadows?",
  "62681": "And why do we set our soul and body, which are such dear companions, at such variance?",
  "62682": "Living together?",
  "62683": "Did you never hear it?",
  "62684": "You don't remember me?",
  "62685": "And what else is paper currency?",
  "62686": "And do you propose to make this journey very shortly?",
  "62687": "But what if fresh disasters should take place?",
  "62688": "Who will say they were not beautiful?",
  "62689": "What did tha' shut thysel' up for?",
  "62690": "Is anybody to come and fetch me?",
  "62691": "But when?",
  "62692": "And what explanation is given of the girl's death?",
  "62693": "What was the dreadful thing I dreamed?",
  "62694": "I should think it was a very pleasant life, the married one, eh?",
  "62695": "But what shall we reply to the medals, undoubtedly genuine, which reckon the fifth year of his tribunitian power?",
  "62696": "Have we either of us ever rubbed thumbs over honestly gained farthings?",
  "62697": "Ah, you are the young woman come to look after my birds?",
  "62698": "There ain't nothing wrong?",
  "62699": "How can we help it?",
  "62700": "Why do you ask such a question, I said, when you ought rather to be answering?",
  "62701": "Would you say six or four years?",
  "62702": "Would you shoot a poor, defenceless girl?",
  "62703": "D'ye think he had great pain when 'a died?",
  "62704": "Which is the duke?",
  "62705": "Now, are you ready?",
  "62706": "Oh, isn't it sweet and fresh back here?",
  "62707": "Can you write shorthand?",
  "62708": "Yes, why did I not steal?",
  "62709": "Will you say it is because the body is the medium of suffering in this life?",
  "62710": "Haven't you no manners?",
  "62711": "And are who what?",
  "62712": "You are of my opinion?",
  "62713": "Could it be possible that the squire was going to make a fool of himself and get married?",
  "62714": "Funny, ain't it, that you and me both had the same idea about spending our vacation?",
  "62715": "But you will?",
  "62716": "Then why didn't you say so?",
  "62717": "How much is it?",
  "62718": "You will permit me to consider him an invalid?",
  "62719": "Where is he concealed?",
  "62720": "But was it his fault?",
  "62721": "You spoke to my coachman, then?",
  "62722": "Was the photograph a cabinet?",
  "62723": "Who's go dar?",
  "62724": "Didn't you hear us calling you?",
  "62725": "For the commission, is it not my whole future?",
  "62726": "Why all this excitement?",
  "62727": "Do you know the numbers?",
  "62728": "Do you wish you may die if you do know, hey?",
  "62729": "Why then should he repine when the hour of separation arrives?",
  "62730": "She had no reason for walking elsewhere, and why should she not go that way?",
  "62731": "Where is the knave?",
  "62732": "Any news, father?",
  "62733": "When did you see him last?",
  "62734": "Why, pray, did he add the old day?",
  "62735": "You think he went off just by chance?",
  "62736": "Is the cause of my soreness such a mystery that there's any need to tell me I am sore everywhere the staff hit me?",
  "62737": "Couldn't ye ha' said soa, at onst?",
  "62738": "What be these two, signior?",
  "62739": "Can anyone here play the drum?",
  "62740": "Shall you like to have such a brother?",
  "62741": "And what is better than woman?",
  "62742": "Ye much hurt?",
  "62743": "How shall I ever look this man in the face again?",
  "62744": "Yes?",
  "62745": "You think there may be fighting?",
  "62746": "Could it be that by some neglect in the preparations, the substitution perhaps of the wrong brandy, the astralization could not be effected?",
  "62747": "Was this to her doom after all?",
  "62748": "How agreed?",
  "62749": "And those papers?",
  "62750": "How is the gentleman called?",
  "62751": "What do you mean, you minx?",
  "62752": "What can be done?",
  "62753": "And why are we here?",
  "62754": "How do you know I can't?",
  "62755": "Amontillado ?",
  "62756": "A coffin?",
  "62757": "Does it suggest anything to your mind?",
  "62758": "Is the second floor at home?",
  "62759": "You are certain?",
  "62760": "Why, did you not hear all we said?",
  "62761": "How, how?",
  "62762": "Is this statement true?",
  "62763": "Then it is my place to ask you what you are going to do about it?",
  "62764": "Won't you come in again, and stay as long as you like?",
  "62765": "Why are you up so early, my dear?",
  "62766": "Who will tell her?",
  "62767": "Guilty, of course?",
  "62768": "Do you laugh, you unfeeling brute, as if you enjoyed my distress?",
  "62769": "What enjoyment is there in making love to a woman who belongs to nobody and yet belongs to any one?",
  "62770": "Have you not a word to say to me?",
  "62771": "Two drunken men, eh?",
  "62772": "What need they torture their heads with that which others have taken so strictly and so unalterably into their own purveying?",
  "62773": "What can be more natural and characteristic?",
  "62774": "Is there anything particular?",
  "62775": "What are you upset about?",
  "62776": "But the bogus inspector?",
  "62777": "And where are the children?",
  "62778": "There are then people who inhabit it?",
  "62779": "But where is thy son now?",
  "62780": "Her happiness?",
  "62781": "Please, ma'am, could I inquire if this highly instructive and charming institution is a new one?",
  "62782": "But why not?",
  "62783": "How would they address us?",
  "62784": "Is there any thing new in this doctrine?",
  "62785": "What was she to say to him?",
  "62786": "You doubt it then?",
  "62787": "What sort of mischief?",
  "62788": "What sense is there in murdering a man in order to define one's relation to a guilty wife and son?",
  "62789": "Then this new kind of knowledge must have an additional quality?",
  "62790": "Lads, haven't you a sack?",
  "62791": "How do you mean, bold?",
  "62792": "What farther proof can be desired for the present system?",
  "62793": "They taught you that?",
  "62794": "But you, critic, the reader undoubtedly will ask, what is your solution?",
  "62795": "But the heat developed by the rapidity of the projectile in crossing the strata of air?",
  "62796": "Of all this we may certainly affirm that we acquired the knowledge before birth?",
  "62797": "Well, are you trying to make out that I've said you have?",
  "62798": "Three days ago?",
  "62799": "What is it, a man?",
  "62800": "Whom do you think that is to?",
  "62801": "The lighted window, right up there?",
  "62802": "An' you don't seem to have done any great things for yourself by going away?",
  "62803": "But if I lose?",
  "62804": "There, who are you?",
  "62805": "Or, perhaps, you may have the precious object she wants in your collection?",
  "62806": "Who do you think should be sent there?",
  "62807": "And what for?",
  "62808": "But, my dear fellow, in that case, why didn't you get him a pauper's funeral?",
  "62809": "Should he place his catastrophe as a third associate in their felicity?",
  "62810": "Can you speak, lady?",
  "62811": "He has extensive house property in the city and three places of business and isn't it to his own advantage to keep down the rates?",
  "62812": "Do what?",
  "62813": "That so?",
  "62814": "And you followed the business of a tailor?",
  "62815": "But how did you gain them?",
  "62816": "Whither should they go, and where should be the new seat of the mission?",
  "62817": "Why can't you let me alone?",
  "62818": "How does his apoplex?",
  "62819": "Ca vous amuse, la vie?",
  "62820": "You would throw over one that has stood by you this five years in favour of a man that you never saw before in your life?",
  "62821": "Ceremonies then are a subsequent thing?",
  "62822": "What can be keeping him?",
  "62823": "Some intrigue, D'Herblay?",
  "62824": "Why do you laugh, sir?",
  "62825": "Should she speak to her?",
  "62826": "How dared they so much as THINK of such a thing?",
  "62827": "Should she open the door or should she not?",
  "62828": "Now, while you have tyranny in so great a degree walled in, and see your enemies over your heads, to what purpose is it to take counsel?",
  "62829": "But don't you know the higher you climb, the colder it gets?",
  "62830": "You do not know that you love me?",
  "62831": "What in thunder has that to do with you?",

  "63630": "What hour is this?",
  "63631": "Do you see this firman?",
  "63632": "What do you mean by all the rest?",
  "63633": "What, then, is the significance of what is called the postal reform?",
  "63634": "I suppose you think me a 'little fool,' as they all call me at home?",
  "63635": "And is't not possible to find it out?",
  "63636": "Where, then, is this love of the celestial father for his creatures?",
  "63637": "By whom posted?",
  "63638": "Can you tell me the time, ma'am?",
  "63639": "You perceive, then, that he is not happy?",
  "63640": "Is it not a waste of time?",
  "63641": "Whither shall we go now?",
  "63642": "What does she say?",
  "63643": "Is he frightened at something, then?",
  "63644": "What is this rent?",
  "63645": "Then you've taken a good constitutional?",
  "63646": "He pays well, I hope?",
  "63647": "Why did he not apply for a passport as every one else does?",
  "63648": "Axel, have you got it?",
  "63649": "What's home?",
  "63650": "What could I gain by betraying you to those who have ruined my nation and my house?",
  "63651": "What's going to happen now?",
  "63652": "I suppose you want young ones?",
  "63653": "Back again at the old homestead, what?",
  "63654": "What name did you say?",
  "63655": "Why do you conduct yourself in this fashion toward me?",
  "63656": "You do not fear that the illness will return?",
  "63657": "Who can so minister to the inherent, perhaps barbaric remnant, love for display?",
  "63658": "Must it go in?",
  "63659": "Have I welcomed a traitor?",
  "63660": "Will you change your mind now, you blockhead?",
  "63661": "And of course you're much too well bred to be inquisitive about other people's business?",
  "63662": "You advertised, I believe, for a salesman?",
  "63663": "Do you play on the guitar?",
  "63664": "Where should they be housed?",
  "63665": "Into the court, sir?",
  "63666": "But why need I go farther?",
  "63667": "Do you realise, father, that I've never had the least blow?",
  "63668": "But why doesn't he come?",
  "63669": "And pray has he done so?",
  "63670": "How long since utility became a principle of law?",
  "63671": "Are they nice apples?",
  "63672": "Cannot I have this one night with you?",
  "63673": "Where meantime was the hapless owner of this wreck?",
  "63674": "What do you mean, my good fellow?",
  "63675": "How far do the cases differ in principle?",
  "63676": "Is it there or not?",
  "63677": "Visiting a sweetheart?",
  "63678": "Is it wrong to watch them?",
  "63679": "Begin to break her, like a poor caged bird, and wear her deluded life away, in teaching her to sing YOUR notes?",
  "63680": "What is our name?",
  "63681": "You are doubtless provided with pistols, gentlemen?",
  "63682": "What sins have we done?",
  "63683": "He hasn't any business, has he?",
  "63684": "Why didn't ye take your holiday like the rest of the men?",
  "63685": "Help him?",
  "63686": "Then why don't you follow the cows?",
  "63687": "Is this worthy of the archic man?",
  "63688": "Could he throw no light?",
  "63689": "And what was the result?",
  "63690": "Well, how have you been?",
  "63691": "Why is not all this real?",
  "63692": "But how could he go away, leaving me in such a state?",
  "63693": "What became of her?",
  "63694": "Didn't I catch hold of his leg, neither, father?",
  "63695": "You didn't know his name, did you?",
  "63696": "Did she not always expect it?",
  "63697": "The husband?",
  "63698": "Well, why shouldn't she marry whom she liked?",
  "63699": "Why did he ever forget it?",
  "63700": "How do you know what men would fall in love with?",
  "63701": "How do you know but that it hurts a geranium's feelings just to be called a geranium and nothing else?",
  "63702": "Did the person wish to smoke?",
  "63703": "Was it a bacchanalia?",
  "63704": "And what do you decide upon now, my lady?",
  "63705": "Well and when the money's gone, what then?",
  "63706": "Do you like that better?",
  "63707": "How did you get such huge huge hands?",
  "63708": "Who were the persons in whom he placed the greatest confidence, and who took the warmest interest in his schemes?",
  "63709": "I was going to say, the will to be interested in him has died, and what else matters?",
  "63710": "Are you satisfied now?",
  "63711": "My goodness, what utter twaddle, and what may all this nonsense have signified, pray?",
  "63712": "That depends on our luck in starting, else why shouldn't we be there in time?",
  "63713": "Of what must I repent?",
  "63714": "Surely not to throw yourself into the river?",
  "63715": "But of what use is it to fatigue myself with vain words?",
  "63716": "Then we may assume that our athletes will be able to fight with two or three times their own number?",
  "63717": "The philanthropist?",
  "63718": "Why, are they after him yet?",
  "63719": "Pet name props?",
  "63720": "And she kept her word?",
  "63721": "And what was the true measurement of the new little world?",
  "63722": "Why are they the happiest?",
  "63723": "Yes, my friend, but if so, when do we lose them?",
  "63724": "Can he not hold his water at reading of a ballad?",
  "63725": "I suppose you're very glad to go?",
  "63726": "What can he want with me?",
  "63727": "What have you been doing here?",
  "63728": "And if it departed how could it move unless it went upwards?",
  "63729": "What could he do else that would have been of the smallest use to her?",
  "63730": "But is there capital punishment where you were?",
  "63731": "Do we stop here?",
  "63732": "How many are they?",
  "63733": "Is it really?",
  "63734": "So that you were at rest?",
  "63735": "A little or much?",
  "63736": "Who then?",
  "63737": "What is thy journey's mark?",
  "63738": "Are you stupid?",
  "63739": "And what's your name?",
  "63740": "Isn't he beautiful?",
  "63741": "But how could I help it?",
  "63742": "Did she die very soon?",
  "63743": "But how can you look on while your children are being taught things which you don't think are true?",
  "63744": "Do you want me to adjudicate that too?",
  "63745": "What is that to me?",
  "63746": "Perhaps you never before noticed him?",
  "63747": "Why is it, I say, that you are thus agitated in relation to the domestic affairs of other communities?",
  "63748": "How can you talk so?",
  "63749": "Who told you that they have never done so?",
  "63750": "Have you got a sledge?",
  "63751": "Haven't you some one who will relieve me of my horse?",
  "63752": "You did, didn't you?",
  "63753": "Police, sir?",
  "63754": "But come whither?",
  "63755": "Then I have received a merely legitimate salary, in spite of the opinion of my confessor?",
  "63756": "But where was the novelty?",
  "63757": "Where is your wife, in the first place?",
  "63758": "And where did the dream come from?",
  "63759": "And what shall I do if you desert me?",
  "63760": "How, nowhere?",
  "63761": "Do you know what we are eating here?",
  "63762": "Yes, but how much?",
  "63763": "Grow pale, fear, calculate?",
  "63764": "Go on the stage?",
  "63765": "Wood?",
  "63766": "What are my heart's experiences?",
  "63767": "What is the ego?",
  "63768": "Why didn't mamma and he live together, as other people do?",
  "63769": "And how much did she give you for this fine enterprise?",
  "63770": "Was there no means of calming this angry sea?",
  "63771": "What did he say to that?",
  "63772": "Do about you?",
  "63773": "What's the sense of it?",
  "63774": "Where is the guilty party here?",
  "63775": "And what happened to him afterwards?",
  "63776": "Is it a duty to postpone everything to a sense of injuries, and wrong to gratify a mother in a request like this?",
  "63777": "What will you do?",
  "63778": "Anything else, my lord?",
  "63779": "Dear mother, are you so resolved?",
  "63780": "Is he injured anywhere?",
  "63781": "Your husband isn't coming?",
  "63782": "But she is proud, is she not?",
  "63783": "But what does the thermometer say?",
  "63784": "Can you ask that question?",
  "63785": "What's become of them, the dear fellows?",
  "63786": "Why are you travelling?",
  "63787": "How should they use it?",
  "63788": "Does he speak to you of this conspiracy?",
  "63789": "And was SHE married?",
  "63790": "You left your door open?",
  "63791": "Is there danger of another?",
  "63792": "What had her infancy been?",
  "63793": "How much money have you left?",
  "63794": "She won't bite?",
  "63795": "What is the matter?",
  "63796": "But what were you going to say?",
  "63797": "She is no relation of his?",
  "63798": "What hard fortune brought us here?",
  "63799": "What if she were so called?",
  "63800": "In other words, should strict impartiality be aimed at?",
  "63801": "And what did he offer?",
  "63802": "Why not go and try to get speech of him and beg for justice?",
  "63803": "What shall you do in life?",
  "63804": "Was not that nearly what you said?",
  "63805": "Is not this a free country?",
  "63806": "Pears like this yer view 's quite refreshing, an't it, stranger?",
  "63807": "Which of these will be mine?",
  "63808": "How did you happen to be taken to a hospital?",
  "63809": "What is it?",
  "63810": "I brought it to the table near the fire, and asked him what he would have?",
  "63811": "Do you remember what you told me once, about her making all the apple parsties and doing all the cooking?",
  "63812": "Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind?",
  "63813": "Does this prove that ignorance and dependence domesticate them?",
  "63814": "Why do you not see this?",
  "63815": "Well, why wouldn't you?",
  "63816": "What is it makes the wolves to leave the woods?",
  "63817": "It is useless?",
  "63818": "Would you rather I didn't talk?",
  "63819": "Mad, is he?",
  "63820": "Is it a pure a priori, or is it an empirical intuition?",
  "63821": "Why does it not encourage its citizens to put out its faults, and do better than it would have them?",
  "63822": "You do work hard, don't you?",
  "63823": "Have you told them where to find me?",
  "63824": "Doesn't it depend a bit on what she regards as charming?",
  "63825": "Where, then, is the ship?",
  "63826": "I'm not very exacting, am I?",
  "63827": "And in what state of mind has he returned to you?",
  "63828": "Didn't you see the gold with your own two eyes?",
  "63829": "What was it that he did?",
  "63830": "Well, then, tell us frankly, what do you think of her personal appearance?",
  "63831": "Why, for example, should the king of a primitive community be prohibited from sleeping lying down?",
  "63832": "Where am I to join on?",
  "63833": "What right have you to bid me leave this house, sir?",
  "63834": "Who would endure this for many lives?",
  "63835": "Which is best off?",
  "63836": "But have they considered whether a better form could have been substituted?",
  "63837": "Tell me, where is the place that men call hell?",
  "63838": "Then will she die too?",
  "63839": "Need it be said that no such measures could destroy that tendency?",
  "63840": "Od's precious, come away, man, what do you mean?",
  "63841": "May I go and help carry the things to the poor little children?",
  "63842": "Have heard them say that there is nothing pleasanter than to get rid of their pain?",
  "63843": "Who could see?",
  "63844": "Have you any more to stake?",
  "63845": "What shall you tell her?",
  "63846": "What like is he?",
  "63847": "Is this of envy or no?",
  "63848": "Why, WHY do they torment me and say I am going to marry you?",
  "63849": "If I went to sleep as I proposed, how could the atmosphere in the chamber be regenerated in the interim?",
  "63850": "I suppose you have searched her desk and things?",
  "63851": "I mean can't you put on your own clothes?",
  "63852": "What, after all, was this new oath?",
  "63853": "What then are we to conclude from these facts and considerations?",
  "63854": "How might it fare more gently with you in all the world?",
  "63855": "What avarice?",
  "63856": "Hurt me?",
  "63857": "Who's not playing fair?",
  "63858": "They were none of them among our friends at the lodge, then?",
  "63859": "Has it been so kept?",
  "63860": "So you are going away in the fall?",
  "63861": "In the flesh?",
  "63862": "Wouldn't you teach them to play on the piano, and paint on velvet?",
  "63863": "Where is my wife?",
  "63864": "Where is my native place?",
  "63865": "And had he married the valiant matron's daughter, as he promised?",
  "63866": "Everything's made to be played, with and broken, isn't it, young 'un?",
  "63867": "Whatcher take me for, hey?",
  "63868": "What do you mean, the rabbit?",
  "63869": "Now what do you say?",
  "63870": "And what sort of men do they graduate?",
  "63871": "He knew then?",
  "63872": "Why must one read books before he can be considered to have learned?",
  "63873": "What was she insolent about?",
  "63874": "You don't hesitate to take a place at my side, do you?",
  "63875": "Daze my eyes, and isn't there?",
  "63876": "Do you not see his heart is fast breaking?",
  "63877": "Can this be possible, uncle?",
  "63878": "Why should they?",
  "63879": "Have you forgotten the day?",
  "63880": "Do you see anything there?",
  "63881": "What is the object of this assembly?",
  "63882": "Good heavens, are you ill?",
  "63883": "Well, did you dig up the watch?",
  "63884": "You will arrest him?",
  "63885": "And aren't you?",
  "63886": "What uncanny secret did it hold?",
  "63887": "Why is she thus possessed, and why does she not spare herself?",
  "63888": "But won't you speak to him?",
  "63889": "At any rate, you have some walks in the neighbourhood?",
  "63890": "You have been a soldier?",
  "63891": "But why a year?",
  "63892": "Who's that laughing at me?",
  "63893": "Where, then, would have been her navy, her trade and even her existence?",
  "63894": "What do you hear from your mother?",
  "63895": "How could I settle the point forever?",
  "63896": "What does that spell?",
  "63897": "He means to marry you?",
  "63898": "But would that be necessary?",
  "63899": "What did happen?",
  "63900": "Is the shepherd said to be just to his sheep and his dogs?",
  "63901": "Why do you keep the secrets of that man, when they mean death to so many?",
  "63902": "But if I pursue and nothing gain, what will it profit me to come up with him?",
  "63903": "Do you wish to get out?",
  "63904": "Clara, are you ready to come home?",
  "63905": "Did you ever hear of such ingratitude?",
  "63906": "The best school?",
  "63907": "Get me up, can't ye?",
  "63908": "Bread?",
  "63909": "Dare they to hope a poet for their friend?",
  "63910": "What do I deduce from this?",
  "63911": "When did that person come here, waiter?",
  "63912": "You once had a horse you cared a great deal for, didn't you?",
  "63913": "What has made you so disobedient and unfaithful?",
  "63914": "You're not in bed?",
  "63915": "What spot?",
  "63916": "Did he believe?",
  "63917": "And now, is this all you have to tell me?",
  "63918": "Could he forego the renown of being the first wit of his age?",
  "63919": "What was he hoping for?",
  "63920": "What name am I to say?",
  "63921": "Elm or fir, both of which abounded in the island?",
  "63922": "And why will they not?",
  "63923": "A new one?",
  "63924": "What if you should die first?",
  "63925": "As day by day the sun sank lower and lower in the sky, could he be certain that the luminary would ever retrace his heavenly road?",
  "63926": "Had they nothing else to say to one another?",
  "63927": "Who told you to steal?",
  "63928": "Did I not tell you how quick and resolute she was?",
  "63929": "Is there any example of an individual object that escaped the government of that law in the whole history of the world?",
  "63930": "Why tarry ye?",
  "63931": "Did he give a reason?",
  "63932": "How did you come here?",
  "63933": "Did I break through one of your rings, that you spread that damned ice on the causeway?",
  "63934": "He asked himself, or were they playing a part?",
  "63935": "Is it true that my mind is only a harmony, and my soul a vortex?",
  "63936": "But if I do fight, you will surely not object to giving me a lesson or two in shooting and fencing?",
  "63937": "Are we women?",
  "63938": "Ah, but it isn't, is it?",
  "63939": "Have you more to say?",
  "63940": "What had really happened?",
  "63941": "How if his death were occasioned by a wound received in defending his master?",
  "63942": "For what is there more prompt, more unexpected, more abbreviatory of space and time, than the maturity of an obligation?",
  "63943": "Would they be right in the future?",
  "63944": "And isn't he?",
  "63945": "And what do you say is your surmise as to your present position?",
  "63946": "Suppose now I ask, why I rather than anybody else?",
  "63947": "If what?",
  "63948": "Have you a heart?",
  "63949": "With me?",
  "63950": "Did you ever hear of such an idea?",
  "63951": "Have you quite forgotten her?",
  "63952": "Haven't they hurt his feelings?",
  "63953": "Won't you come in, brother?",
  "63954": "So you are good enough to pass my appearance?",
  "63955": "Is it tobacco?",
  "63956": "I ask you what can I do?",
  "63957": "Could it have been an early hornet?",
  "63958": "Who is that?",
  "63959": "Can you drink anything?",
  "63960": "Why not pursue an end confessedly good by peaceable and regular means?",
  "63961": "Did he come to arrest me?",
  "63962": "Whither so fast, child?",
  "63963": "Ah, why will you not unseal my lips?",
  "63964": "Does this look like confidence?",
  "63965": "Has it gone well?",
  "63966": "Admires the jay the insect's gilded wings?",
  "63967": "And did they often get a chance to do that?",
  "63968": "And do I love?",
  "63969": "UNDER THE CROSS,' hey?",
  "63970": "What did you look at, so fixedly?",
  "63971": "Why stop?",
  "63972": "And of what are you so sure?",
  "63973": "And the friend he regards and describes as one in whom he has an interest, and the other as a stranger in whom he has no interest?",
  "63974": "Can't you see what a beautiful thing it would make?",
  "63975": "For all that, are not our dresses as beautiful as yours?",
  "63976": "Why are they fighting?",
  "63977": "Is the danger you apprehended last night gone by now, sir?",
  "63978": "When the winds blow and the seas flow?",
  "63979": "Do you call this acting the part of a man and a gentleman, sir?",
  "63980": "Why should not I eat birds?",
  "63981": "Shan't we see any more of him?",
  "63982": "A slap in the face?",
  "63983": "What have you to do with our independence?",
  "63984": "Are you sure you can get 'em out of their fix?",
  "63985": "What principle directed it?",
  "63986": "Besides, why should I say anything about it to him?",
  "63987": "How did you get this passport?",
  "63988": "The house is sold, then?",
  "63989": "Well, have ye heard the news?",
  "63990": "What kind of person is she?",
  "63991": "Did he hear me?",
  "63992": "You were his constant companion, then?",
  "63993": "Is it not rather an appeal to the proprietory instinct, the COMMERCIAL instinct?",
  "63994": "Is that true, mother?",
  "63995": "How once?",
  "63996": "Wot I say?",
  "63997": "They're a nice lot, ain't they?",
  "63998": "Well, and what does it signify whether it was he or I?",
  "63999": "What formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward?",
  "64000": "Would it be believed, that when near nineteen, any one could be so stupid as to build his hopes of future subsistence on an empty phial?",
  "64001": "For what?",
  "64002": "Is not this absurd?",
  "64003": "Do you know that I am to be beheaded outside this window?",
  "64004": "Eh, who's there?",
  "64005": "How many a year, did you say?",
  "64006": "You intend to show off your intelligence, I suppose?",
  "64007": "Did you want me?",
  "64008": "What are you talking about, man?",
  "64009": "Is it possible that even now, when I give you these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?",
  "64010": "But where were you going, when you met us?",
  "64011": "How do you tink she can be ven you leave her to kill herself so?",
  "64012": "D'Artagnan?",
  "64013": "I wonder where I shall be this time tomorrow?",
  "64014": "Taenarum?",
  "64015": "Cannot you understand that the time it takes to wink is a whole eternity if it severs me from the beauty of your face?",
  "64016": "Tomorrow, then, sire?",
  "64017": "And who are you?",
  "64018": "What did ye?",
  "64019": "Did you put out the lamp?",
  "64020": "How long would it last?",
  "64021": "Who is still to come?",
  "64022": "Should he abandon this man?",
  "64023": "How about the others?",
  "64024": "Has he brought his brig with him?",
  "64025": "And what are my instructions?",
  "64026": "To make that reply and then perish, what could be grander?",
  "64027": "Why do I?",

  "65447": "Have you any notion what's at the back?",
  "65448": "But not the air you breathe?",
  "65449": "Or is it yours?",
  "65450": "Is your time, then, expired, since I find you in a fair way to return there?",

  "66001": "How,' do you ask?",
  "66002": "Yes, mamma?",
  "66003": "You expected my son would be a coward?",
  "66004": "Then came the question, which of the two next doors?",
  "66005": "And how did you manage on the twelfth?",
  "66006": "Does that still mean CONTINENT?",
  "66007": "All right, are you?",
  "66008": "Or is it anything to me whether she is enchanted or not?",
  "66009": "How are you going to do it?",
  "66010": "How can you, who long for the love and sympathy of man, persevere in this exile?",
  "66011": "That's the way the wind blows, is it?",
  "66012": "You hear, madame?",
  "66013": "You're sweet on him aren't you?",
  "66014": "Do I look the sort of girl that's always falling in love with every man she meets?",
  "66015": "Am I vanquished?",
  "66016": "Don't anybody know?",
  "66017": "Who do you suppose would teach you wrong?",
  "66018": "Always the same and always a fraud?",
  "66019": "Wasn't it quite enough?",
  "66020": "You have been reading the papers diligently of late, have you not?",
  "66021": "What aids expect you in this utmost strait?",
  "66022": "How long will the supply of chemical last?",
  "66023": "Has he given you any?",
  "66024": "But when I fell into the mistake I have so long remained in, at least you led me on?",
  "66025": "Is it the general himself you wish to see?",
  "66026": "Of course do you understand then, that it's no matter what comes of this fellow?",
  "66027": "Why don't you hit one of your size?",
  "66028": "Yes, doesn't he look comical?",
  "66029": "But besides these eight men, you doubtless place some guard outside?",
  "66030": "How so, of your disposition?",
  "66031": "Sirrah, why fall you not to?",
  "66032": "Do you know what I'm really thinking of?",
  "66033": "How many years have you been fattening on the commune?",
  "66034": "Did it upset YOU very much?",
  "66035": "But you say you do not wish to kill me?",
  "66036": "Who shall be master but the giver of the feast?",
  "66037": "Make a little wound in their arms, and rub each other's blood into the cut?",
  "66038": "Were not the laws, which have the charge of education, right in commanding your father to train you in music and gymnastic?",
  "66039": "Is the doctor afraid that you may be recognized?",
  "66040": "Then will not the citizens be good and civilized?",
  "66041": "Did she give up society?",
  "66042": "Will you not give it, sire?",
  "66043": "Will they pass us by?",
  "66044": "What more is to be done?",
  "66045": "I wish to know if, in demanding my signature, you leave me entirely free in my person?",
  "66046": "Can any one part with his life?",
  "66047": "What could it be, then?",
  "66048": "Where is the road to the east?",
  "66049": "And dare you maintain, my lord, that you at that time fulfilled the commands of your royal master simply and exactly?",
  "66050": "Can any one explain such things?",
  "66051": "And then breakfast, sir?",
  "66052": "Who is to go first?",
  "66053": "Were they normal?",
  "66054": "Do you understand, damn you?",
  "66055": "Do you carry it about with you always?",
  "66056": "What can this mean?",
  "66057": "Isn't that enough?",
  "66058": "Bare enough, now, an't it?",
  "66059": "To warn her?",
  "66060": "No, but IS he?",
  "66061": "How can I?",
  "66062": "That's it, is it?",
  "66063": "You hate mankind?",
  "66064": "But will it do you any more good to devour it with your eyes than with your teeth?",
  "66065": "Thinner?",
  "66066": "But what is the reckoning?",
  "66067": "Was he not fallen himself?",
  "66068": "But are you sure of having exhausted all other ways?",
  "66069": "But the queen?",
  "66070": "Is it not frightful?",
  "66071": "Anybody here?",
  "66072": "What will you consider the first thing to be done?",
  "66073": "May I ask to what these questions tend?",
  "66074": "Paul?",
  "66075": "And you've been idling at the schoolmaster's too, instead of coming here, ha'n't ye, hey?",
  "66076": "Is she valiant?",
  "66077": "Is this the dog goes with you?",
  "66078": "Was not the door closed?",
  "66079": "Why should one death be great, while our sacrifice is horrible?",
  "66080": "What food do you eat?",
  "66081": "I wonder if I can't get loose?",
  "66082": "Will your worship read it to me, noble sir?",
  "66083": "Where did the blood come from?",
  "66084": "Pretty smooth?",
  "66085": "You will, won't you?",
  "66086": "By doing what clever trick?",
  "66087": "Is the deed of sale ready?",
  "66088": "Are we lost?",
  "66089": "You don't remember me?",
  "66090": "A murder?",
  "66091": "Of what, then, does humanity repent?",
  "66092": "Or if honour or victory or courage, in that case the judgement of the ambitious or pugnacious would be the truest?",
  "66093": "When, where, how?",
  "66094": "How can such enormous jars have been manufactured?",
  "66095": "What can mine own praise to mine own self bring?",
  "66096": "How could they be cordial with their sore consciences and shamed faces?",
  "66097": "Sith passed pleasures double but new woe?",
  "66098": "For you have neither relatives nor acquaintances whom you need fear to offend by living with me?",
  "66099": "How can ships sail this way and that?",
  "66100": "The stock is in your own hands?",
  "66101": "Is the danger apprehended from the other branches of the federal government?",
  "66102": "Who says it?",
  "66103": "What is going on, my lord?",
  "66104": "What can I want?",
  "66105": "How did you come up?",
  "66106": "But whence does he derive the title of count?",
  "66107": "His former love?",
  "66108": "Do you need help?",
  "66109": "Is he infirm?",
  "66110": "Jumped out of window?",
  "66111": "Why should ye ought?",
  "66112": "Why not simply issue a general order that you intend to do this?",
  "66113": "Do you like him?",
  "66114": "And the remorse of an adoring husband?",
  "66115": "Did you ever know him to cut himself in shaving before?",
  "66116": "If you are to blush to hear of such things now you are an old married woman, when are you not to blush to hear of them?",
  "66117": "What shall you do after tonight?",
  "66118": "How came you to see her?",
  "66119": "Can he endure no noise, and will venture on a wife?",
  "66120": "Why enlist?",
  "66121": "What did they talk about?",
  "66122": "But, so far as you can ascertain, he did not take it?",
  "66123": "Or should we perhaps go to him?",
  "66124": "Who is in the room besides you?",
  "66125": "What about him?",
  "66126": "Why are you standing up?",
  "66127": "Going to the raffle as well as ourselves?",
  "66128": "I wonder, is it not too late to administer unction?",
  "66129": "If we possess this force and our allies or partners do not, how do we fight together?",
  "66130": "Will you take red wine?",
  "66131": "Are the rules the same?",
  "66132": "And how many sheep?",
  "66133": "The surprise?",
  "66134": "Is my lord dead?",
  "66135": "You know her, it seems?",
  "66136": "Of WHAT?",
  "66137": "My enemy, say you?",
  "66138": "Who made them enemies?",
  "66139": "Why work on an old wound?",
  "66140": "D'ye think not?",
  "66141": "So you mean to strap them instead?",
  "66142": "What on earth does she mean?",
  "66143": "If you are suspected, you shall give the alarm?",
  "66144": "How are you going to keep the game up?",
  "66145": "Why ain't whopper as good as falsehood?",
  "66146": "Why will the seamen always become morbid when possible?",
  "66147": "You noticed she wasn't a lady, didn't you?",
  "66148": "Do you know him, ma'am?",
  "66149": "Do you want to go anywhere?",
  "66150": "Well, a great deal must have soaked through, must it not?",
  "66151": "Is that the sort of thing you tell them at your hospital?",
  "66152": "Who knows whether the sun is not a blind man?",
  "66153": "Now what is decay?",
  "66154": "What advantage should I have over you, if knowing your secret I were to tell you mine?",
  "66155": "What were you trying to do with all your signs?",
  "66156": "Are we to take him up to her?",
  "66157": "What will she do?",
  "66158": "What do you talk so for?",
  "66159": "That who was here?",
  "66160": "Where could I get a drink?",
  "66161": "What do you mean by that?",
  "66162": "What shall we learn from THAT stuff?",
  "66163": "Is it nearly finished?",
  "66164": "And where is my wife?",
  "66165": "Well, then, you made the boating man believe that he was the father, did you not?",
  "66166": "If society is binding on the boat, is it also binding on the provisions?",
  "66167": "But tell me, do you think I am so beautiful?",
  "66168": "What finer retinue could be expected for his funeral?",
  "66169": "And is it not the very diagnostic of true salvation that it shall overcome the fear of death?",
  "66170": "You do not mean to ride, gentlemen?",
  "66171": "May I mention something?",
  "66172": "Why don't you leave me alone?",
  "66173": "You understand how those things are managed?",
  "66174": "But what would become of this human imago in a state of perfect bliss?",
  "66175": "What are all systems, religious, political, or scientific, but opinions resting on evidence more or less satisfactory?",
  "66176": "Perhaps that you're searching far too much?",
  "66177": "And do you know whither he went?",
  "66178": "Did some marine monster come from time to time, to breathe at the bottom of this well?",
  "66179": "Then, of course, you can read and write quite correctly?",
  "66180": "Have we any of us any friends there?",
  "66181": "You wouldn't want any one to do you out of your chance to get your rights, would you?",
  "66182": "Then I shall be of no use to your majesty?",
  "66183": "What did I care about paradise?",
  "66184": "And now how was I to proceed to reconstruct this midnight drama?",
  "66185": "It is, is it, sir?",
  "66186": "It doesn't seem likely she'd stop having them all at once when she's been so in the habit of it, does it?",
  "66187": "Wasn't it awful?",
  "66188": "Shall we try to catch it?",
  "66189": "Where could she find it?",
  "66190": "Well, what have you proved?",
  "66191": "Don't the very greatest ladies of all talk about that small clique of persons to whom they belong?",
  "66192": "This way, or that way?",
  "66193": "Was he tired of her already?",
  "66194": "Don't you think the fowl may have come out of the country, aunt?",
  "66195": "How did he strike you, prince?",
  "66196": "Have not your fathers taught you this, I say, whilst as yet ye were but children?",
  "66197": "Bounderby?",
  "66198": "But, it will be said, is this all that pure reason can effect, in opening up prospects beyond the limits of experience?",
  "66199": "She was greatly admired, of course?",
  "66200": "Isn't that strange?",
  "66201": "Why cannot man be content to live alone and be happy, and let the women live alone and be happy too?",
  "66202": "Can equality, by the right of succession, be preserved between citizens, as well as between cousins and brothers?",
  "66203": "Ay, and ashamed of it too?",
  "66204": "Cadby's death was from drowning, you say?",
  "66205": "Where's this young lady I've been hearing such a lot about?",
  "66206": "Why, then, didn't you reply?",
  "66207": "And how did it happen?",
  "66208": "And you?",
  "66209": "Lor, if the devil don't get them, what's he good for?",
  "66210": "Do you think they are dead?",
  "66211": "Has it ever been done before?",
  "66212": "Who's that boy?",
  "66213": "Or do you know some reason why it suits your father's book to amalgamate as well as it suits mine?",
  "66214": "Had you not better light a candle?",
  "66215": "Do you know where he lives?",
  "66216": "Is there ony country where they talk i' that way?",
  "66217": "What did that mean, to kiss?",
  "66218": "And how was she to punish her?",
  "66219": "Tyler appointed him?",
  "66220": "Had the nervous strain resulted in a hallucination, or did the door really move?",
  "66221": "Could she not be brought for just one little instant?",
  "66222": "Can you see me?",
  "66223": "Then to put the question is to solve the problem?",
  "66224": "Can you row up?",
  "66225": "Holding up a bank?",
  "66226": "To meet you in this way, on the sly?",
  "66227": "And what's a sonne?",
  "66228": "What am I to say to him?",
  "66229": "And in the first place, he will honour studies which impress these qualities on his soul and disregard others?",
  "66230": "And you couldn't remember?",
  "66231": "And booted, spurred, and whip in hand, too?",
  "66232": "Would I come and look at it?",
  "66233": "Did you remark the postmarks of those letters?",
  "66234": "Do you see what I meant about the clothes falling off?",
  "66235": "Where is your escort?",
  "66236": "Is it necessary, pray, to illustrate a remark in so practical a style?",
  "66237": "Would he go and describe his rough reception, or recount his exploit?",
  "66238": "What, in the name of everything hideous, did this mean?",
  "66239": "Are you going somewhere?",
  "66240": "Do you know her?",
  "66241": "What can have happened?",
  "66242": "I presume you know, gentlemen, to whom my friend is indebted for this piece of patronage?",
  "66243": "Among them odd heaps of old papers, this gentleman, when he comes into the property, naturally begins to rummage, don't you see?",
  "66244": "Why are you distressed?",
  "66245": "Are you going to have lunch too?",
  "66246": "And what is the means?",
  "66247": "And if I did know them now, what would it avail me?",
  "66248": "What would you have?",
  "66249": "Revels?",
  "66250": "Now will you believe I'm in earnest?",
  "66251": "Is the sun up?",
  "66252": "Oh, what's that?",
  "66253": "Is it the immediate object of this confidence, that you may at once ascertain that, with my knowledge?",
  "66254": "How large was it?",
  "66255": "Then had I not best send him about his business?",
  "66256": "What does it matter?",
  "66257": "Don't your store people trust you?",
  "66258": "Shall we invite him into our hearts?",
  "66259": "What have you done with her, then, if you have her no longer?",
  "66260": "Then you'll not be wanting me any more tonight, ma'am?",
  "66261": "Jane, do you hear that nightingale singing in the wood?",
  "66262": "Where could they be going?",
  "66263": "Won't you?",
  "66264": "Not in regular government pay and employment, to lay traps?",
  "66265": "But who could affirm, who would dare to say, that the amiable fellow did not really see that which his two companions would not see?",
  "66266": "You can't recommend anything for the boy, I suppose?",
  "66267": "What was it that she wanted of him?",
  "66268": "Where are the nearest?",
  "66269": "How has he drawn you to himself?",
  "66270": "Not even of sending me a scrap of stuff for a new dress?",
  "66271": "If he cuts off one of his own toes, or one of his assistants', would you be very much astonished?",
  "66272": "Was the weather hot or cold?",
  "66273": "Where was my baggage?",
  "66274": "Authority?",
  "66275": "Tell him or not tell him?",
  "66276": "O you will let me hold your brave hand, stranger?",
  "66277": "You think so, my lord?",
  "66278": "In your left ear?",
  "66279": "Am I a soothsayer?",
  "66280": "Who shall live up to the great trust?",
  "66281": "Are we there already?",
  "66282": "And my council dares to temper and negotiate?",
  "66283": "How are you?",
  "66284": "But what?",
  "66285": "It was you, was it not?",
  "66286": "Am I not by?",
  "66287": "Have you given up loving her altogether?",
  "66288": "What good does it do?",
  "66289": "You have never heard her nephew play?",
  "66290": "And what is thy want?",
  "66291": "What sin, mademoiselle?",
  "66292": "Or that it is impossible to draw more than one right line betwixt any two points?",
  "66293": "Do you think I could ever skip like that?",
  "66294": "Can you send me to the station?",
  "66295": "When did you leave service?",
  "66296": "Well, what do you think of that?",
  "66297": "What DO you know of him?",
  "66298": "What good will he be to the tribe?",
  "66299": "What, did you come digging here entirely because of me?",
  "66300": "Do you feel that you have lost her?",
  "66301": "What, senor?",
  "66302": "Or the raspberry?",
  "66303": "What is there?",
  "66304": "What have you been after?",
  "66305": "You don't mean to say he stole money, do you?",
  "66306": "But who are all these?",
  "66307": "Well, what d'you think of it?",
  "66308": "Oh, I?",
  "66309": "You couldn't write?",
  "66310": "You here again?",
  "66311": "You have no trouble, I hope, to keep you waking?",
  "66312": "What is, or was, their address?",
  "66313": "But of what disease, then, did she die?",
  "66314": "Trodden upon by whom?",
  "66315": "Mighty men?",
  "66316": "No, but what do you mean?",
  "66317": "Yes, I am out of temper, and do you know why?",
  "66318": "Did you ever hear anything like your brother's eloquence?",
  "66319": "And what is the use of a fellow having a little money if it does not make him independent?",
  "66320": "Why have you no pride?",
  "66321": "Who are you, that you are to play with two young people's affections and break their hearts at your will?",
  "66322": "Yes?",
  "66323": "You mean, will it be prudent?",
  "66324": "What is justice?",
  "66325": "How so?",
  "66326": "Weren't you listening to me?",
  "66327": "What's in it?",
  "66328": "Did he himself find no cause for laughter on the earth?",
  "66329": "And who completed it as it now is?"
