  "4580": "And why on earth does she want to speak to me at all?",
  "4581": "What did you do it for?",
  "4582": "What reason had you to strike the man who won my daughter?",
  "4583": "What good is arguments to me?",
  "4584": "And who escapes his lot?",
  "4585": "How is she looking?",
  "4586": "Why so?",
  "4587": "What did he wish for?",
  "4588": "Would she take it as a joke?",
  "4589": "And is she not effectually degraded?",
  "4590": "Final for couples?",
  "4591": "They must be sold, I suppose?",
  "4592": "But what shall I do?",
  "4593": "Who can tell what a dark, dreary, hopeless life I have dragged on for months past?",
  "4594": "What could be the trouble in that quarter?",
  "4595": "What does it matter, after all?",
  "4596": "What is the result of it?",
  "4597": "Did you hear that cry?",
  "4598": "Did you ever see such a large peach in all your life?",
  "4599": "How much are you to give him?",
  "4600": "How many?",
  "4601": "Everything as it used to be?",
  "4602": "And how may that be?",
  "4603": "Can there be a rational adjustment of the claims of each?",
  "4604": "Father, that money is mine, why should I speak to you about that?",
  "4605": "Surely, sweet, it shall never be our dwelling?",
  "4606": "If he is it's not much good my coming, is it?",
  "4607": "Would those stiff trees that had outlived the eagle, turn young and airy pages to him, to skip on his errands when he bade them?",
  "4608": "At what hour shall we come?",
  "4609": "Have you any tips to give us before we clear out?",
  "4610": "Which is the principal aim of these three?",
  "4611": "Does not the word express more than the fact, and must not the actual, whatever a man may think, always, in the nature of things, fall short of the truth?",
  "4612": "That's to you, I suppose, child?",
  "4613": "Is it really?",
  "4614": "Do you want any assistance?",
  "4615": "Yes, and is there a rope handy?",
  "4616": "Do you think it would be good for you?",
  "4617": "Suppose I handed you over to the police?",
  "4618": "And is the art of war one of those arts in which she can or can not share?",
  "4619": "And when did you arrive here?",
  "4620": "But how did he procure his books?",
  "4621": "You know her only son died eight years ago?",
  "4622": "At once?",
  "4623": "You do not like it, then?",
  "4624": "Non es eques, quare?",
  "4625": "Has he asked you to give me the message?",
  "4626": "Some holy book, no doubt?",
  "4627": "Is it possible that one can forget and forsake what he once loved?",
  "4628": "Shall I put myself into the harness to be worn out like an old horse?",
  "4629": "You come from the contractor, you say?",
  "4630": "Why do you do it?",
  "4631": "Am I never to hear the last of this?",
  "4632": "You say that these thirteen millions are found to be wanting in the accounts?",
  "4633": "Then why not admit that these may be replaced some day by other moral intuitions to be evolved in an unknown future?",
  "4634": "What of yourself?",
  "4635": "Surely there must be someone among all of you here who will turn this shameless creature out of the room?",
  "4636": "What on earth is the use of time to a fellow who has twice as much of it as he knows what to do with?",
  "4637": "Or had he found something he wished to keep to himself?",
  "4638": "And how do these wiseacres know that man wants a normal, a virtuous choice?",
  "4639": "Why not furnish an unequivocal explanation of its object?",
  "4640": "Do you see that mainmast there?",
  "4641": "Any letters for me?",
  "4642": "Why are you so upset?",
  "4643": "Have you never felt the romance of that love?",
  "4644": "An explanation, pray, of what?",
  "4645": "And how on earth do they get at it?",
  "4646": "Do they get you bairns?",
  "4647": "Cannot one find friends among the animals, and choose some tame kid or eloquent parrot or amiable monkey?",
  "4648": "You wish to exchange crosses?",
  "4649": "Well, and did you like it very much?",
  "4650": "Would you mind describing him to me?",
  "4651": "But do you understand the mission you are fulfilling?",
  "4652": "How about accidents?",
  "4653": "Do you think this is the end?",
  "4654": "Doing well, I suppose?",
  "4655": "What doth it profit to argue about hidden and dark things, concerning which we shall not be even reproved in the judgment, because we knew them not?",
  "4656": "And then, mother?",
  "4657": "Do you sometimes think that I took an unfair advantage of your weakness?",
  "4658": "In what way did you mean it, sir?",
  "4659": "What did the gentleman say to her, my sonny?",
  "4660": "Did he name no one in his passion?",
  "4661": "What kind of political ambition was to result from this destructive political education?",
  "4662": "He knows them, then?",
  "4663": "Could narrow passages spread from it through the foundations of the island?",
  "4664": "Suppose we were to meet any of them?",
  "4665": "Have you anything?",
  "4666": "And what is the cause of this?",
  "4667": "Or flatter sorry bunglers?",
  "4668": "By my orders?",
  "4669": "So you do not plead guilty?",
  "4670": "Now, are not you fancying, gentlemen, that I am expressing remorse for something now, that I am asking your forgiveness for something?",
  "4671": "Would a man grow weary of such a look turned on him, of such arms held out?",
  "4672": "Why does she give me notice when it's too late?",
  "4673": "Why then do we not follow his example, doing as he did in the countries through which we pass?",
  "4674": "And have you forgiven her for all she has made you suffer?",
  "4675": "Which of us is there can tell how much vanity lurks in our warmest regard for others, and how selfish our love is?",
  "4676": "Has the owner many ships?",
  "4677": "To a distance?",
  "4678": "This house?",
  "4679": "You think it would?",
  "4680": "But now who will relieve me of the dread?",
  "4681": "Have the which?",
  "4682": "Is it not obvious?",
  "4683": "Why did you come to tell me yourself, instead of sending my man?",
  "4684": "Holidays?",
  "4685": "I mean did you see the statue fall?",
  "4686": "And she refused you as she says?",
  "4687": "Durbeyfield?",
  "4688": "Can I see the letter?",
  "4689": "In what then, pray, shall I obey you?",
  "4690": "Why should you make a principle out of what you yourselves are, and must be?",
  "4691": "Why should we imagine that the precious metals are likely to do so?",
  "4692": "And what did he answer?",
  "4693": "Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?",
  "4694": "What could he say to her now, after all he had said formerly, when he held her hands as he kissed her hair beside her cheeks?",
  "4695": "No female nurses?",
  "4696": "How did you happen to think of it?",
  "4697": "And what can I do but obey their commands?",
  "4698": "Would it, indeed, have been better if we had loved each other as a boy and a girl, and forgotten it?",
  "4699": "What social and political rights have women?",
  "4700": "And are they arrested?",
  "4701": "Puffs?",
  "4702": "Where do they come from, then?",
  "4703": "Marriage?",
  "4704": "Now, sir, why are you late again, as usual?",
  "4705": "Might anybody ask what their brother has been saying?",
  "4706": "Well, my children, what is going on now?",
  "4707": "What death?",
  "4708": "To what party did he belong?",
  "4709": "Does that suggest nothing to you?",
  "4710": "Where away?",
  "4711": "How did you penetrate hither?",
  "4712": "Caught cold in the grottos, at night, perhaps?",
  "4713": "You are sure?",
  "4714": "Well, and what did the last one say to ye?",
  "4715": "Did you come in the gig?",
  "4716": "And the DISENCHANTMENT of woman is in progress?",
  "4717": "Had your breakfast yet?",
  "4718": "Could he write something original?",
  "4719": "Breakfast?",
  "4720": "Now what does this imply?",
  "4721": "What possessed him to turn listener?",
  "4722": "Is this not a quite unusual politeness?",
  "4723": "Whatever have you done now?",
  "4724": "Are these things nothing?",
  "4725": "Did my sons get power and money?",
  "4726": "If they are such a happy class of people, how was it that you had such a time of punishing and hanging them within the last two years?",
  "4727": "And what have you been thinking about THEM, my busy bee?",
  "4728": "But how will it be?",
  "4729": "Could anything exceed the picture he gives one of scientific ardour?",
  "4730": "There is no exit that way?",
  "4731": "But was he worse?",
  "4732": "Yet how long before it was unsettled again?",
  "4733": "Or are they late because they have had a lovers' meeting?",
  "4734": "Cranly asked softly, happier than you are now, for instance?",
  "4735": "What does it matter to me whether the prince is to be what the late king was?",
  "4736": "How can I urge my daughters now to go and raise large families?",
  "4737": "And what did it matter?",
  "4738": "What are you meddling with, stupid?",
  "4739": "Why do you specify the fox?",
  "4740": "Who said that?",
  "4741": "But you have found out something for yourself?",
  "4742": "What is filled with more real existence, and actually has a more real existence, is more really filled than that which is filled with less real existence and is less real?",
  "4743": "Well, what if I could?",
  "4744": "Did you bet?",
  "4745": "Are you not weary of that stupid, meaningless, constantly repeated fraud?",
  "4746": "I say, you're not putting off a party tonight, are you?",
  "4747": "Well, then, what'll we make him the ink out of?",
  "4748": "But, bishop, the question is, who has the power to settle it?",
  "4749": "What does friendship mean if it not so?",
  "4750": "Well, what time for repayment do you wish me to take?",
  "4751": "Whuzzis?",
  "4752": "Why is the hawk so hated by birds?",
  "4753": "About measures, or rhythms, or verses?",
  "4754": "What sort of young woman?",
  "4755": "Do you know where I shall find him?",
  "4756": "I sprung out of bed, and asked, what wreck?",
  "4757": "Are you sure this time?",
  "4758": "Would he have drawn back?",
  "4759": "Why must he go around hunting for some one who is supporting me or has supported me at some time in his life, and who has said something at some time contrary to that platform?",
  "4760": "Had ever a queen such a throne before?",
  "4761": "Or was he a debtor or a debtor's son?",
  "4762": "Not quite so far, I hope?",
  "4763": "For what is maintenance?",
  "4764": "What will you?",
  "4765": "Go whither?",
  "4766": "But, after the ball, why had he not returned?",
  "4767": "And where did you hear it?",
  "4768": "What data could he expect from an uncleaned watch?",
  "4769": "But what is all this about?",
  "4770": "And destroy their lives, when they've helped me to remake mine?",
  "4771": "But need we fear anything beyond a momentary anger?",
  "4772": "And which are these two sorts?",
  "4773": "To drink?",
  "4774": "What shall we do, then, to push this great war of freedom and justice to its righteous conclusion?",
  "4775": "Will you get the mail, dear?",
  "4776": "Yes, very noble?",
  "4777": "Do you know where I am leading you?",
  "4778": "Did we notify them of this sage view of ours when we borrowed their money?",
  "4779": "Why did you form a monster so hideous that even YOU turned from me in disgust?",
  "4780": "Atone for a fault by paying money?",
  "4781": "How can you build on such a quicksand?",
  "4782": "The proper determination of these relations rests on the question, to what faculty of cognition they subjectively belong, whether to sensibility or understanding?",
  "4783": "Is that cough of his better?",
  "4784": "Why does he not look at me?",
  "4785": "From what house does the young noble come?",
  "4786": "But now how stands the wind?",
  "4787": "You promise me that frankness?",
  "4788": "And are you building?",
  "4789": "Would his uncle give him a place in the bank?",
  "4790": "What do you think, would they give us anything for it?",
  "4791": "Do you not know?",
  "4792": "How far does one of these little revolvers carry?",
  "4793": "Shall I seal the door?",
  "4794": "Yea, and what work, king's daughter?",
  "4795": "How long will the air in the reservoirs last for us to breathe on board?",
  "4796": "What have you to offer to me, my friend?",
  "4797": "No doubt you felt this yourself?",
  "4798": "Would he take her back to the beach or would he keep her here?",
  "4799": "And that principle which repels the musical, or the just?",
  "4800": "Why had he withheld life from her?",
  "4801": "Is life grievous to you?",
  "4802": "And are we to be carried on far and away into remote distance, and never, never to return?",
  "4803": "Why do you speak so?",
  "4804": "As for what you do me the honor to say, I presume you mean I was afraid?",
  "4805": "So, why not accept these sports as legitimate expressions of a normal and wholesome human nature?",
  "4806": "Whose camp are you in, those who bless or those who curse?",
  "4807": "Is it my mother?",
  "4808": "What is your opinion of it?",
  "4809": "How in the world did you deduce that?",
  "4810": "Now guess what the young one did?",
  "4811": "What money is there to be made here in any other way?",
  "4812": "But suppose she does come there?",
  "4813": "And was this not to be obtained?",
  "4814": "Your reason, your reason for this?",
  "4815": "And silent all?",
  "4816": "What keeps them dancing till five o'clock in the morning through a whole mortal season?",
  "4817": "Why is it not seen that these ideas are mutually repellent, and that, if, by some impossibility, the proletaire could reach a certain degree of intelligence, he would make use of it in the first place to revolutionize society and change all civil and industrial relations?",
  "4818": "What can it be, then?",
  "4819": "Are you aware what you are saying, my lord?",
  "4820": "So much per man?",
  "4821": "What made you go away with him?",
  "4822": "Will all things be set right in the nation?",
  "4823": "Have you informed him of it?",
  "4824": "What is this vessel?",
  "4825": "Devotion which is weary, heroism which has grown old, ambitions which are sated, fortunes which are made, seek, demand, implore, solicit, what?",
  "4826": "Would you venture to so consider them had they been committed by any nation on earth against the humblest of our people?",
  "4827": "He?",
  "4828": "But who had made her tell it?",
  "4829": "To get her out of my bride's way, who might otherwise walk over her rather too emphatically?",
  "4830": "What is the best way of living for us monks?",
  "4831": "Was that the reason why you quitted the service, monsieur le chevalier?",
  "4832": "Where were you meaning to spend the evening?",
  "4833": "Come at last where your duty calls you, eh?",
  "4834": "Who will push a drum hither for me?",
  "4835": "Who has a right to strike her dead?",
  "4836": "Could it be well that she should sacrifice the happiness of two persons to a theoretic love of pure blood?",
  "4837": "But how is it that you know so much of these matters?",
  "4838": "And what is the faculty in man to which imitation is addressed?",
  "4839": "But where do you come from not to know what every coachman in the town knows?",
  "4840": "What is that pain like?",
  "4841": "Drop me in the park, will you?",
  "4842": "When do you wish the carriage to be here?",
  "4843": "Any one dead?",
  "4844": "Have you lost it?",
  "4845": "But if you have a genius for painting, would it not be right to take that as a guide?",
  "4846": "Is that the question?",
  "4847": "A philosopher, perhaps?",
  "4848": "Is it likely?",
  "4849": "May I count upon your assistance?",
  "4850": "Of tea with me over the fire?",
  "4851": "And now, my friend, as you cannot come to me, may I come to you?",
  "4852": "Will you render me a little help?",
  "4853": "Are you scoffing at me?",
  "4854": "How do you suppose I managed when you were away?",
  "4855": "Is it so, or is it not so?",
  "4856": "If he could mollify the lioness with such a sop, how happy would he think his first efforts had been?",
  "4857": "And are you nervous?",
  "4858": "Do you say no?",
  "4859": "And why may we not continue that ratio far beyond that period?",
  "4860": "And how so, if you please?",
  "4861": "Abdicated?",
  "4862": "Why tell all that?",
  "4863": "And with regard to us, how were you placed?",
  "4864": "Then where is he gone?",
  "4865": "Think of you?",
  "4866": "Or did I only imagine that you did?",
  "4867": "Yet what do we have but words?",
  "4868": "Is't not simply the best that ever you heard, captain?",
  "4869": "Is there any ground for all these questions, or not?",
  "4870": "Can you satisfy us of that?",
  "4871": "If his beauty allures my eyes, and my eyes listen to the call, shall I say that I love him just for that?",
  "4872": "How shall I call her?",
  "4873": "Is that where you belong?",
  "4874": "What child?",
  "4875": "You wrote it?",
  "4876": "What's the old man have so much to do with him for?",
  "4877": "A daughter, I suppose?",
  "4878": "What have you said to your father about all this?",
  "4879": "Is he grateful?",
  "4880": "And your precautions were successful?",
  "4881": "How does one manage to dance through one's heels first?",
  "4882": "What pursuit would I follow?",
  "4883": "Is it a single corporate body?",
  "4884": "Would they not?",
  "4885": "Would you like to write and tell her so?",
  "4886": "It may be asked, if a man has abilities equal to his appointment in the state, and is affectionate to the constitution, what occasion is there for being virtuous, since these two things alone are sufficient to enable him to be useful to the public?",
  "4887": "Are you not too much shut up?",
  "4888": "Who is't?",
  "4889": "To go where?",
  "4890": "Was this done on purpose?",
  "4891": "Could she have guessed?",
  "4892": "What course shall we pursue?",
  "4893": "But is it best?",
  "4894": "And what will a man such as he be likely to do under such circumstances, especially if he be a citizen of a great city, rich and noble, and a tall proper youth?",
  "4895": "How did you open it before?",
  "4896": "What is there in this world more melancholy than such a dinner?",
  "4897": "Why so?",
  "4898": "Well, well, what was it you were going to say about the prince?",
  "4899": "How many are there of them, then?",
  "4900": "Amelia, is it?",
  "4901": "Has he any children?",
  "4902": "But does he say so?",
  "4903": "Ought he to have paid as much as two shillings?",
  "4904": "What extremity did he accept?",
  "4905": "In view of what they saw, did they still wish we had been there?",
  "4906": "Does SHE say all this too?",
  "4907": "From my letter?",
  "4908": "But what should he say in his report?",
  "4909": "What are your intentions regarding the girl?",
  "4910": "What, you've been in the room quite a time?",
  "4911": "Were they expelled from society on his account?",
  "4912": "But who is this?",
  "4913": "Why do you injuriously introduce the name of my mother by adoption?",
  "4914": "Were you really in love?",
  "4915": "Who shall decide between them?",
  "4916": "Stripped whom?",
  "4917": "If you will not help us in our effort to choose the wisest course, how can we perform the duty which you yourself put upon us?",
  "4918": "Do you wish to make every woman hate me and every man stare at me?",
  "4919": "Who knows whether the rack may not yet conquer your spirit, and whether you, with your mangled limbs, may not by the fury of the pain yet be brought to that point that you will recant and abjure your faith?",
  "4920": "What was he?",
  "4921": "How did you get to the island?",
  "4922": "Well, then, I want to know what you are going to do with your half of it?",
  "4923": "And if I were to die, what would you do?",
  "4924": "Who in the world can it be?",
  "4925": "Is she here?",
  "4926": "But may I inquire how you intend to support the establishment?",
  "4927": "Has the count come in?",
  "4928": "Pistols?",
  "4929": "Which road leads to it?",
  "4930": "Is there a variance?",
  "4931": "What will you do for clothes?",
  "4932": "Which do you like best?",
  "4933": "Quarrel?",
  "4934": "Is it not perfectly clear that, if antiquated claims are to be set up against recent treaties and long possession, the world can never be at peace for a day?",
  "4935": "How their land did not bring forth its fruit?",
  "4936": "Oh, do you?",
  "4937": "Did you sleep well?",
  "4938": "And what about her teeth?",
  "4939": "And he never mentioned any names?",
  "4940": "What his powers?",
  "4941": "And wherefore should it not bring you peace?",
  "4942": "May I ask, sir, the cause of this accident?",
  "4943": "What has been done in the suit?",
  "4944": "With THAT creature?",
  "4945": "Have I said that she was beautiful?",
  "4946": "And how can one who is thus circumstanced ever become a philosopher?",
  "4947": "Will you, please?",
  "4948": "And are you sure he does not remember my face or person?",
  "4949": "And not from the picture in the paper?",
  "4950": "WHy has every man a conscience then?",
  "4951": "Where had I so rashly thrown it?",
  "4952": "What is its intestine?",
  "4953": "Where did you last reside?",
  "4954": "These yearnings why are they?",
  "4955": "What the deuce is it to me?",
  "4956": "Starting from you, is it?",
  "4957": "But how's that?",
  "4958": "Was the host not in arms and fighting every day, when there was no truce?",
  "4959": "Was he not an emigrant then?",
  "4960": "What, then, is to become of royalty?",
  "4961": "You regard the circumstances of his end as entirely consistent with a death from that cause?",
  "4962": "What was the matter with the house?",
  "4963": "After the execution?",
  "4964": "Impelled towards her, as I certainly was, for I was very anxious that she should like me and was very glad indeed that she did, why should I harp afterwards, with actual distress and pain, on every word she said and weigh it over and over again in twenty scales?",
  "4965": "Did she call to refuse her consent?",
  "4966": "Noirtier?",
  "4967": "How do you suppose you can ever make yourself popular if you go about touching people on the shoulder?",
  "4968": "What's come of all the boys?",
  "4969": "What is it, pray?",
  "4970": "What did they do then?",
  "4971": "Now, were these shades of green, belonging to tropical vegetation, kept up by a low dense atmosphere?",
  "4972": "What should her lover do?",
  "4973": "How can one push on?",
  "4974": "Well, ought we not to go there?",

  "4976": "Are they capable of attempting violence?",
  "4977": "In what propositions is pure reason unavoidably subject to an antinomy?",
  "4978": "Despatches or what?",
  "4979": "Oh, then my father has really a very large fortune, count?",

  "6537": "Why do you say it's out of the question?",
  "6538": "Is it our fault?",
  "6539": "Where do you suggest we should take up our quarters?",
  "6540": "I think it took about five minutes for the steam to disappear, and what did I see then?",

  "6610": "Even at sailing?",
  "6611": "His faithful servant, as his eminence himself told me?",
  "6612": "Shall I accompany you, monsieur?",
  "6613": "To know if you have seen a young man pass, fifteen years of age, mounted on a chestnut horse and followed by a groom?",

  "6624": "What shall I believe then?",
  "6625": "And do you feel sad here?",
  "6626": "But why not?",
  "6627": "Was he our malignant enemy, or was he by chance our guardian angel?",
  "6628": "A storm?",
  "6629": "Am I to consider this as part of my income on account?",
  "6630": "What has all this money done?",
  "6631": "Can it be a ship?",
  "6632": "What do I hear?",
  "6633": "Copper?",
  "6634": "Why did you steal it?",

  "6687": "Why is it that you doubt my word?",
  "6688": "You put me off, do you?",
  "6689": "No one observes us?",
  "6690": "And what will you say to them?",
  "6691": "What can they be doing inside?",
  "6692": "And what do you think of her personal appearance?",
  "6693": "And you will obey me, will you not?",
  "6694": "Have you any objection to my looking at your register?",
  "6695": "Or would the meteor prove too powerful for it?",
  "6696": "Could she be dreaming?",
  "6697": "We do seem to make a little progress, do we not?",
  "6698": "Where's the use of asking for such fellows' reasons?",
  "6699": "But what do you believe?",
  "6700": "I can work, then?",
  "6701": "Now what say you to a pasty, or a strip of beef cut where the juice runs, and maybe the half of a broiled fowl?",
  "6702": "How can you ask me?",
  "6703": "And is the sum you bring me worth the trouble?",

  "6718": "How does she live?",
  "6719": "Were we to die as he had done?",
  "6720": "Is it then surprising, that when the sole ambition of woman centres in beauty, and interest gives vanity additional force, perpetual rivalships should ensue?",
  "6721": "Then what on earth are they up to?",
  "6722": "Why do I come to you thus?",
  "6723": "You will ask me why I did not dispose of it?",
  "6724": "What have you to say now?",
  "6725": "Do you mean, were we talking about diamonds?",
  "6726": "Shall I carry no message, madame?",
  "6727": "Would any man weary of it, or wish to turn away his eyes?",
  "6728": "But who can be angry at those assiduities which are meant to please him?",
  "6729": "Does it hurt?",
  "6730": "Where are you, old fellow?",
  "6731": "And have quite forgiven me?",
  "6732": "Did I say a word when he came and took me away, for no earthly reason, from the place where everybody was kind to me?",
  "6733": "How did you know it, then?",
  "6734": "Burning up your awld aunt's rubbidge, I suppose?",

  "6741": "Are you ashamed of it?",
  "6742": "But you expected some one then?",
  "6743": "And did he spring clean from the mark or had he to get off with a push?",
  "6744": "You did not see her?",
  "6745": "But, in the name of heaven, man, where did you get these extraordinary clothes?",
  "6746": "You say you heard a knocking?",
  "6747": "But what is to be done now?",
  "6748": "But how did you feel when you were loved by a servant?",
  "6749": "Dobbin?",
  "6750": "Will you set them fighting still further, or will you make peace between them?",
  "6751": "Think we're liable to have much trouble?",
  "6752": "You've brought it, have you?",
  "6753": "What think you my friend did?",

  "6758": "What in the world can be more ridiculous than commercial laws carried out to one's own detriment?",
  "6759": "With THEM?",
  "6760": "And why do we fuss and fume sometimes?",
  "6761": "But why would you return to face again the fierce banth, or whatever other form of destruction they have loosed within that awful trap?",
  "6762": "Do you know what my private and candid opinion is about some of those little jokers?",
  "6763": "What'll he do with it?",
  "6764": "But what next?",
  "6765": "The letter about the mortgage has come, has it?",
  "6766": "A robber maybe?",
  "6767": "And why do you serve?",
  "6768": "Must he see, must he know?",
  "6769": "Do they denote or connote anything?",
  "6770": "Do you, then, really return?",
  "6771": "What a temptin lookin critter you'd be among the galls, would'nt you?",
  "6772": "Think only, what are my children to be?",
  "6773": "You were not content to hear me, eh?",
  "6774": "What have I done that this burden should be laid on me?",
  "6775": "Will you bet?",
  "6776": "Is not our fortune famous, brave, and great?",
  "6777": "Are you so daintily brought up, you cannot eat your own flesh?",

  "6784": "And to whom?",
  "6785": "How long would he be left uneducated?",
  "6786": "Only you here?",
  "6787": "Do you wish me to beg pardon of this creature because she has come here to insult our mother and disgrace the whole household, you low, base wretch?",
  "6788": "And the desire which goes beyond this, or more delicate food, or other luxuries, which might generally be got rid of, if controlled and trained in youth, and is hurtful to the body, and hurtful to the soul in the pursuit of wisdom and virtue, may be rightly called unnecessary?",
  "6789": "Ah, naughty, naughty, would you take a nip at the gentleman?",
  "6790": "What does the presence do?",
  "6791": "Who would not suffer amid perfumed tapestries, cushioned furniture, and liveried servants?",
  "6792": "Well, and how are you?",
  "6793": "Yet who else in all the world was there with the strength and agility to do what this man was now doing?",
  "6794": "Why be uneasy?",
  "6795": "So you are going to sell the place?",
  "6796": "Is he still in a fit?",
  "6797": "But heavens, why?",
  "6798": "What might you be able to do?",
  "6799": "Music?",
  "6800": "There is then more than one who might await you there?",
  "6801": "What's the matter with your tooth?",
  "6802": "Well, who is my benefactor?",
  "6803": "Why so, if you please?",
  "6804": "Where is the man who was here?",
  "6805": "Who again was his closest ally?",
  "6806": "What is your history?",
  "6807": "Are you coming tomorrow?",
  "6808": "How now?",
  "6809": "For the best?",
  "6810": "And did you convey this answer to your guest?",
  "6811": "Did you ever see such a den, my dear?",
  "6812": "Yet why are those names disgraceful?",
  "6813": "Not damn the sharper, but the dice?",
  "6814": "And what IS her idea?",
  "6815": "Do you feel inclined to make the monks' acquaintance once more?",
  "6816": "Are they little, then?",
  "6817": "What are you thinking about, doctor?",
  "6818": "Is it that the poets are deliberately trying to present the conditions of an age anterior to their own?",
  "6819": "What do you want me for, sir?",
  "6820": "Who spoke of such a thing?",
  "6821": "Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?",

  "6823": "My little lady, where are you going to?",
  "6824": "What can it mean?",
  "6825": "Would you counsel him to do so?",
  "6826": "Shall I also smite them dead?",
  "6827": "Bah, really?",
  "6828": "You dispute me?",
  "6829": "May I ask what led to this change?",
  "6830": "Why not a fortnight from now?",
  "6831": "What means this shouting in the house?",
  "6832": "And shall disaffection only be rewarded with security?",
  "6833": "Where else will one find a more happy union of magnificence and comfort, where better arrangements to facilitate commerce?",
  "6834": "May I ask why that date?",
  "6835": "Did you get him?",
  "6836": "Is conduct everything?",
  "6837": "You have, then, a repugnance to your profession?",
  "6838": "What could be the matter?",
  "6839": "Where is the doctor?",
  "6840": "Who'll stop me?",
  "6841": "Then will you not forgive me?",
  "6842": "Would you like to speak to him?",
  "6843": "Well, how is he?",
  "6844": "Why not own your own home?",
  "6845": "Was he angry, or pleased?",
  "6846": "But how discover what demands are just?",
  "6847": "Snow?",
  "6848": "How many miles?",
  "6849": "What sort of legislators were they?",
  "6850": "As he was to finish reading there, why not set out at once?",
  "6851": "Does she love me?",
  "6852": "Then, why did you think of giving your daughter to him?",
  "6853": "Are they out beanfeasting?",
  "6854": "Is it not that we may enjoy our liberty?",
  "6855": "Whither else?",
  "6856": "How then shall I take away these opinions?",
  "6857": "You are hurt?",
  "6858": "Any occasion to show my papers?",
  "6859": "And what could he say to her?",
  "6860": "What does it matter to me?",
  "6861": "Can this be my whole purpose?",
  "6862": "What did she know of this strange creature at her side?",
  "6863": "Pyramids?",
  "6864": "What is ther to do, now?",
  "6865": "How did you begin?",
  "6866": "When I heard her dismiss the footman, I stepped up to him and asked him, what little lady that was?",
  "6867": "You may ask, by what authority do I venture, being a person not concerned in the practice of medicine, to meddle with that subject?",
  "6868": "And what do you wonder?",
  "6869": "So I's to gouge out all their eyes, eh?",
  "6870": "What was it about?",
  "6871": "And the hyperbola?",
  "6872": "And in what city did you live?",
  "6873": "Are you not ashamed to speak to a wretch lying on the stones?",
  "6874": "Can I do anything for you?",
  "6875": "Yet how many people have I hated in my life?",
  "6876": "And straightway hereupon, arose the natural question of cui bono?",
  "6877": "Could that girl have been playing off any of her coquettish tricks?",
  "6878": "What was I to say?",
  "6879": "Where are you damn'd?",
  "6880": "Do you care to pursue further?",
  "6881": "You take me?",
  "6882": "What could I do but follow him?",
  "6883": "So why was she surprised?",
  "6884": "Will they be here long?",
  "6885": "You are quite aware of that?",
  "6886": "What mean you?",
  "6887": "The first question is, whether a government, proposing to itself the propagation of religious truth as one of its principal ends, is more likely to lead the people right than to lead them wrong?",
  "6888": "And what if they were friends, brethren, countrymen?",
  "6889": "Have we not thieves enow among us already?",
  "6890": "Shall I ring for them to carry you down?",
  "6891": "Is it a blaspheming clause or reserve any way scandalous unto the world?",
  "6892": "And who is this woman?",
  "6893": "What are we to fight about?",
  "6894": "And how then?",
  "6895": "Where's he going to?",
  "6896": "Would you like to go to school?",
  "6897": "What's a ransom?",
  "6898": "Anything wanting to the bonnet?",
  "6899": "Indeed, even apart from an analogy, is it not mighty interesting to narrate, anyway?",
  "6900": "But was I free to claim this liberty?",
  "6901": "Is he hanging somewhere?",
  "6902": "The bear?",
  "6903": "Straker?",
  "6904": "Oh, he is, is he?",

  "6910": "Can I drop you anywhere?",
  "6911": "Was it some midnight assassin who had come to carry out the murderous orders of the secret tribunal?",
  "6912": "But is this all that is known?",
  "6913": "Now, maiden, before this wedding continues, whom will you have to husband?",
  "6914": "Why that word virtuous, said he, I pray you?",
  "6915": "To set off to see her again?",
  "6916": "Ought I to be angry with her for being faithful to him?",
  "6917": "And the waiters, yea, and the inns at which they waited, and the cold rounds of beef inside, and the stunted ostler, with his blue nose and clinking pail, where is he, and where is his generation?",
  "6918": "Will not the reasons which indicate the propriety of this arrangement strongly plead for an admission of the other branch of that body to a share of the inquiry?",
  "6919": "Before I close may I say a few words upon two topics, much discussed out of doors, upon which it is highly important that our judgment should be clear, definite, and steadfast?",
  "6920": "What shall I do?",
  "6921": "What would you say, sir squire, to my having such a great natural instinct in judging wines that you have only to let me smell one and I can tell positively its country, its kind, its flavour and soundness, the changes it will undergo, and everything that appertains to a wine?",
  "6922": "Do you know this girl that your friend has made himself a fool about?",
  "6923": "Did you get my hedgehog?",
  "6924": "And what would you do?",
  "6925": "Do you know that he loves YOU, yet?",
  "6926": "Whither so fast?",
  "6927": "Sonya, what is the matter with you?",
  "6928": "Why should he die?",
  "6929": "Are you off?",
  "6930": "How like you him?",
  "6931": "Who, in the situation in which the world has placed me, has a right to require more at my hands?",
  "6932": "Why do you ask with such alarm?",
  "6933": "Where could he hope to find this powerful help?",
  "6934": "Will you come out with me?",
  "6935": "Who did that there?",
  "6936": "What would you that I should reply?",
  "6937": "And are you trying to keep it from me?",
  "6938": "Will you go to the ship in the boat?",
  "6939": "Does that satisfy you?",
  "6940": "The horrible punishment to which you have condemned me for the last six years?",
  "6941": "She had asked him whether the tyrant was soon to pass that way?",
  "6942": "Men in this place?",
  "6943": "To whom did you say?",
  "6944": "To make your will?",
  "6945": "What's the use of making mysteries?",
  "6946": "Do you take a middle course?",
  "6947": "And are you going to run away before you have fairly taught or learned whether they are true or not?",
  "6948": "Did you catch a glimpse of the towns on its borders?",
  "6949": "And pray what IS my position, madame?",
  "6950": "What has he against me?",
  "6951": "What can a fellow do with a fellow like that?",

  "6953": "Are you in a great hurry?",
  "6954": "But that I feare?",
  "6955": "Corky around?",
  "6956": "Gone?",
  "6957": "Was I convinced of the truth of what I had heard?",
  "6958": "How would the papers talk about it?",
  "6959": "She could pity, or sacrifice herself, or have instincts, but had she ever loved in the noblest way, where man and woman, having lost themselves in sex, desire to lose sex itself in comradeship?",
  "6960": "Now, what theory could justify these perpetual hecatombs?",
  "6961": "A family gathering, is it not, with these old fellows under us here?",
  "6962": "And can therefore neither be ignorance nor knowledge?",
  "6963": "Does the night arise?",
  "6964": "Do you like the position of it?",
  "6965": "May it not have been, that some species of insect upon which they fed had likewise migrated, and that certain noxious animalcules, which had been kept down by this class, had thus multiplied within the atmosphere until their numbers caused disease?",
  "6966": "But why should I not?",
  "6967": "Is it sooth?",
  "6968": "What right have you, monseigneur, to demand an account of my attachments and friendships?",
  "6969": "Can you think that that active brain was at rest during all those weary centuries, whilst her free soul was flitting from world to world amongst the boundless regions of the stars?",
  "6970": "Who the devil's that?",
  "6971": "Officers, do you hear?",
  "6972": "Shall I guess?",
  "6973": "What has brought you here?",
  "6974": "Where can all the strength of those medicines go, my dear?",
  "6975": "Did you ever see such a binding?",
  "6976": "And shall we proceed to get rid of the weepings and wailings of famous men?",
  "6977": "Why, have you got into a scrape and want to know how he'll take it?",
  "6978": "Watch in hand?",
  "6979": "How do you find them?",

  "6988": "You are a brave people and you love bravery, but where was your mighty jeddak during the fighting today?",
  "6989": "Who was the anonymous person, eh?",
  "6990": "Single or married?",
  "6991": "What remained for her, but to train her children in her own views and sentiments?",
  "6992": "What brings you here, man?",
  "6993": "Was this a saner point of view than the one she had felt constrained to take when she arrived, through so much agony of renunciation, at her decision?",
  "6994": "But what is the truth?",
  "6995": "You give me the lie and will not draw your sword?",
  "6996": "And where do you live?",
  "6997": "Had she given up to heaven the pure soul of an old maid, the calm soul of a spouse, the tender one of a mother, or one moved by love?",
  "6998": "Can anyone who reads these lines form an idea of the effect this had upon us?",
  "6999": "Why, how came you to be so well acquainted with all this?",
  "7000": "Why should he respect any but himself?",
  "7001": "Will you eat a pudding?",
  "7002": "Will you wake me, before departing?",
  "7003": "What did you tell me?",
  "7004": "But if you have why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures?",
  "7005": "What end would that answer?",
  "7006": "What have you done to me?",
  "7007": "Why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them?",

  "8265": "Does that then run about on the street, so that it can be caught and made a prisoner of?",
  "8266": "Monsieur, what next?",
  "8267": "Will you come in, my friend?",
  "8268": "Greenland?",
  "8269": "All round?",
  "8270": "What ship is this?",
  "8271": "Oh, will you not go?",

  "8273": "What about the tariff?",
  "8274": "What is to become of her?",
  "8275": "Why, now, would we welcome a man like that?",
  "8276": "What has taken place?",
  "8277": "Are you satisfied now, dear boy?",
  "8278": "Would eighteenpence be?",
  "8279": "And yet, on the other hand, if they were going to make the venture, the sooner they did it the better, for were they not paying rent all the time, and living in a most horrible way besides?",
  "8280": "And which is the factory?",
  "8281": "Never do what?",
  "8282": "So you have a hole in your stomach?",
  "8283": "Will any one go with me?",
  "8284": "It is a duel, then?",
  "8285": "How are you now, dear?",
  "8286": "And in what light did you view the occurrence?",
  "8287": "Why should that man give me a false diamond?",
  "8288": "Shall you and I never travel together again?",
  "8289": "Do I love her, that I desire to hear her speak again, and feast upon her eyes?",
  "8290": "And things are NOT too utterly far gone with them?",

  "8316": "Said I not all seams and dents but one?",
  "8317": "Had your dinner, I suppose?",
  "8318": "And why should I describe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel?",
  "8319": "And is it not summed up in these four words?",
  "8320": "But if we even could suppose a distinction of interest between the opulent landholder and the middling farmer, what reason is there to conclude, that the first would stand a better chance of being deputed to the national legislature than the last?",
  "8321": "Then, if women are to have the same duties as men, they must have the same nurture and education?",
  "8322": "Undo me behind, will you?",
  "8323": "Well, have you been attacking the new order of things?",
  "8324": "Then this is an inn?",
  "8325": "And the note is in it?",
  "8326": "Why have they not done so?",
  "8327": "What think you?",

  "8337": "Lost your purse?",
  "8338": "What difference can it make whether he is a duke or a groom so long as he is intelligent and good?",
  "8339": "Still getting stouter?",
  "8340": "And are you?",
  "8341": "Like?",
  "8342": "And who's to feed the little one?",

  "8353": "Why not announce thyself openly, and cast me off at once?",
  "8354": "Whom are you going to cook?",
  "8355": "Are no probabilities to be accepted, merely because they are not certainties?",
  "8356": "What can she want with you now?",
  "8357": "Noticed anything peculiar about the room?",
  "8358": "Clever people, eh?",

  "8364": "What sized man is he?",
  "8365": "But have we still far to go to the northward?",
  "8366": "What companion, my dear boy?",
  "8367": "What folly will not a pair of bright eyes make pardonable?",
  "8368": "Did it not seem as if the settlers were laying the first stone of some edifice?",
  "8369": "Does the example even of the war now going on tend to justify that conclusion?",
  "8370": "And leave the treasure?",
  "8371": "But, when a lady descends to marry a groom, is not the groom her head, being her husband?",
  "8372": "Do you see?",
  "8373": "Was it an explosion of gas?",
  "8374": "Of course you know the legend of the fiend dog which haunts the family?",
  "8375": "Do you see this passing whirlwind called SOCIETY, from which burst forth, with startling brilliancy, lightnings, thunders, and voices?",
  "8376": "You have never spoken?",
  "8377": "What is to become of me?",
  "8378": "And why is he blarzy, miss?",
  "8379": "And, then, also, why make a man unhappy by telling him what he does not know?",
  "8380": "What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here?",
  "8381": "An order, sire?",
  "8382": "To whom did this anarchical scoffer unite himself in this phalanx of absolute minds?",
  "8383": "And how may we account for it?",
  "8384": "What fascination is it that can take you back, and make you cling to wickedness and misery?",
  "8385": "Where can you take him to?",
  "8386": "And must I tell you, my lord what they wished us to cry as well?",
  "8387": "And would be sorry to part with them?",
  "8388": "I need not ask, I suppose, whether you found the journey pleasant this time?",
  "8389": "Were they daughters of the family?",
  "8390": "How was that possible?",
  "8391": "Would you think there were any thing in him?",
  "8392": "Do you know what we were talking about when you came in?",
  "8393": "Why do you distill into the heart of the man you term your friend all the bitterness that infects your own?",
  "8394": "Was she annoyed, too, about something?",
  "8395": "What giants?",
  "8396": "For whose?",

  "8407": "How I loved him?",
  "8408": "Do you want to sink the ship, by knocking off at a time like this?",
  "8409": "What was there in the world now for which it was worth his while to live?",
  "8410": "You mean we can leave at once?",
  "8411": "May I venture to submit my arm to him?",
  "8412": "Now, uncle, what do they call that there?",
  "8413": "May he not be less willing by a firm conduct, to make personal enemies, when he acts under the impression that a time is fast approaching, on the arrival of which he not only MAY, but MUST, be exposed to their resentments, upon an equal, perhaps upon an inferior, footing?",
  "8414": "And how long do they generally last?",
  "8415": "What do you say to this?",
  "8416": "And it will not cut?",
  "8417": "Will you go so high up as that?",
  "8418": "Is my visage astray?",
  "8419": "And where is the messenger?",
  "8420": "Why not use the rafters overhead, call them boxes, and charge two francs for a seat on them?",
  "8421": "Would we be done for?",
  "8422": "What is life to me?",
  "8423": "Who shall furnish him with a new basis for his special science?",

  "8425": "But why should this man pretend to be his own brother?",
  "8426": "Tambourine playing?",
  "8427": "What's settled, then?",
  "8428": "Well, but where can he fly to?",
  "8429": "Well, what am I going to do?",
  "8430": "Does he know anything?",
  "8431": "And you think you can find the place again where it was buried?",
  "8432": "Have you been paid?",
  "8433": "An important public character arising in that hemisphere, shall I be told that its influence will not be felt at home?",
  "8434": "Your decision on the subject of my name is irrevocable, I suppose?",
  "8435": "Shall you see the king again?",
  "8436": "I am to remain on this gaudy platforna on which my miserable deception has been so long acted, and it is to fall beneath me when you give the signal?",
  "8437": "It will take you a day to mend this wheel?",
  "8438": "Besides, what is easier?",
  "8439": "And there, in the bright moonlight, what did they see?",
  "8440": "Do you need any help?",
  "8441": "But why will he let anyone off?",
  "8442": "What meant that odd raised place?",
  "8443": "Something to think over when we are alone, it's like to be?",
  "8444": "What call you your nephew, signior?",
  "8445": "How can you possibly justify yourself?",
  "8446": "You here?",

  "8456": "Think you I weigh this treasure more than you?",
  "8457": "In what manner, in consequence of what prodigy, had any community of life been established between this celestial little creature and that old criminal?",
  "8458": "Do you know why they are fighting?",
  "8459": "What makes you talk so, then?",
  "8460": "Did she swim?",
  "8461": "Are you sure so much pampering is really good for the men's characters?",
  "8462": "But where's your staircase coming out with its three steps?",
  "8463": "Cui bono?",
  "8464": "And what supply is preparing for it, my lords?",
  "8465": "Worse?",
  "8466": "And what is his story?",
  "8467": "Or was it a test of my strength of affection, that I should institute no inquiries upon this point?",

  "8476": "But how did I explain existence?",
  "8477": "We say that we are against arbitrary rule and despotism, and is this not the most awful despotism?",
  "8478": "Has your excellency found our defense so feeble as to believe the measure necessary?",
  "8479": "For why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do?",
  "8480": "You did not take to pieces all the chairs?",
  "8481": "Is it you, my child?",
  "8482": "And if these things were done in the green tree, what would have been done in the dry?",
  "8483": "What shall I do to you?",
  "8484": "What is the use of trying to make things worse?",
  "8485": "Is it inherent in all human nature to make this obliging inquiry?",
  "8486": "How poverty?",
  "8487": "Who among you will be my companion and my vizier?",
  "8488": "Who wishes to remit money to his family, as I will send it and deduct it from his wages?",

  "8491": "What staff of life?",
  "8492": "Can you be?",
  "8493": "Why, then, are you armed?",
  "8494": "Is longest life worth aught?",
  "8495": "But did you find nothing worth taking which escaped the other gentlemen of the road?",
  "8496": "What difference does it make to me?",
  "8497": "Whither go you now with him?",
  "8498": "Was it you calling me?",
  "8499": "What step did I take upon this occasion?",

  "8506": "Have you any more to make?",
  "8507": "Should he lose her again?",
  "8508": "Smith, where is she?",
  "8509": "Or can such an one account death fearful?",
  "8510": "Was the woman brought in guilty?",
  "8511": "What do I call her for it?",
  "8512": "And is this his mother?",
  "8513": "What does one live for?",
  "8514": "Ah, to see me?",

  "8537": "Who knows?",
  "8538": "Who was the lady thus celebrated?",
  "8539": "For why not?",
  "8540": "That is not a family name?",
  "8541": "Anybody here seen anything of any such game?",
  "8542": "Shortly?",
  "8543": "And you last saw him at eight o'clock last night?",
  "8544": "What was it altogether?",
  "8545": "Is not this a desperate state of things?",
  "8546": "Spartan?",
  "8547": "That is to say, you wish to lean on my arm, and yet to walk your own way?",
  "8548": "What is the basis of them all?",

  "8558": "But how can you be sure when you do meet the right one?",
  "8559": "What will be the judgment a century hence concerning the lauded works of our favorite composers today?",
  "8560": "I asked him, how they came to make that desperate attempt?",

  "8586": "But, do you hear?",
  "8587": "Also to be soothed, and gently and reverently entreated when angry, even more than a father, and either to be persuaded, or if not persuaded, to be obeyed?",
  "8588": "A great honour for me, is it not?",
  "8589": "Will you now be so good as to tell me with whom I have the honor of conversing so pleasantly, instead of being in the ambulance with that maniac's bullet in my body?",
  "8590": "What was the use of any anathema when he would only take it away, as a dog does a bone, and enjoy it in a solitary corner?",
  "8591": "Not the way to get on in life, you'll tell me?",
  "8592": "What resolution did he take?",
  "8593": "Whither have they gone, then?",
  "8594": "Surely it is not because she is so very anxious to find a husband?",

  "8607": "You had better have a slice of ham or an egg, or something with your tea?",
  "8608": "Have you not heard?",
  "8609": "Would it be all right to telephone down to the office, or do you think it would be better to ring?",

  "8666": "From whom may the letter be you bear to his eminence?",
  "8667": "More than ten pounds?",
  "8668": "To what extent, at this time, was she really a victim?",
  "8669": "What is he here for?",
  "8670": "Lachenel?",
  "8671": "Have you not seen him?",
  "8672": "And so you pick me up in your round, eh?",
  "8673": "What should I be afraid of?",
  "8674": "Where, where, he asked himself, was it all to end?",
  "8675": "Do you not see that you are sliding down a declivity, and that you are obliged to grasp at something similar to the existing law?",
  "8676": "Did she go last night?",
  "8677": "What CAN be done about her?",
  "8678": "Is there anything else you want, good man?",
  "8679": "What view do you take of it?",
  "8680": "And what is knowledge, and among whom is it found?",
  "8681": "Half a crown?",
  "8682": "Did this arise from scorn or from respect?",
  "8683": "Would you mind giving me a little something?",
  "8684": "Who is our friend, my dear friend?",
  "8685": "What does he do that for?",
  "8686": "For what time shall I order dinner?",
  "8687": "Yes, but beer?",
  "8688": "You remember, miss, that we passed some conversation on a certain man this morning?",
  "8689": "Why have you stayed away so long?",
  "8690": "Under her direct appeal for the truth?",
  "8691": "Did you hit your man?",
  "8692": "Is it not time to awake from the deceitful dream of a golden age, and to adopt as a practical maxim for the direction of our political conduct that we, as well as the other inhabitants of the globe, are yet remote from the happy empire of perfect wisdom and perfect virtue?",
  "8693": "Says his father is buried there, eh?",
  "8694": "It is a conspiracy, then?",
  "8695": "You would not have recognized me?",
  "8696": "What conclusion do you draw from it?",
  "8697": "How could we know when you would return?",
  "8698": "But what further do they couple with these demands which they make for congressional legislation?",
  "8699": "Did you see what he went after?",
  "8700": "Shillings perhaps?",
  "8701": "How did it begin?",
  "8702": "Did you quarrel with him?",
  "8703": "Where are you going so fast?",
  "8704": "What do you think better?",
  "8705": "What availed him then his strength and his prowess?",
  "8706": "But surely he has been destroyed?",
  "8707": "Does the gentleman always have books like that under his arm?",
  "8708": "Was he seen to come out?",
  "8709": "Is your excellency really in earnest?",
  "8710": "And what did she say to that?",
  "8711": "To whom can I speak it now?",
  "8712": "Who owes it you?",
  "8713": "What will the poor authors do in the presence of this omnipotent union of booksellers?",
  "8714": "But you said when we were getting up this morning that you had something you wished to tell me before I left?",
  "8715": "Did you fancy yourself dying?",
  "8716": "Aramis become your surety?",
  "8717": "Does he say so?",
  "8718": "What do you think will happen?",
  "8719": "What impression has my evidence made upon you?",
  "8720": "And how do you come to be in our province?",
  "8721": "Where is that friend or enemy now?",
  "8722": "Do you support him for that purpose?",

  "8730": "But when?",
  "8731": "What have we seen in our own personal walks through life to make us believe that women are devils?",
  "8732": "Is that mere guesswork?",
  "8733": "Who then is YOUR neighbour?",
  "8734": "But my horse, madame?",
  "8735": "Has he been wounded, then?",
  "8736": "D'you mean to say that you could take me back after all that's happened?",
  "8737": "Whatever is this?",
  "8738": "Do not they know where the shoe pinches?",
  "8739": "But will he listen to me?",
  "8740": "What did you RECKON he wanted with it?",
  "8741": "But your own vessel, monsieur?",
  "8742": "And it's going on?",
  "8743": "Now spose you make me an offer?",
  "8744": "How can the continued overflowings of a susceptible heart suffer it to be incessantly employed in so many little cares relative to the person?",
  "8745": "Vholes?",
  "8746": "There has not been any change made about your own arrangements?",
  "8747": "Do you question it, when you will make me proud and happy above all others of your court?",
  "8748": "Was that lure of men even now in the house, completing her evil work?",
  "8749": "Can he be right?",
  "8750": "What was he like?",
  "8751": "What was the subject, madam?",
  "8752": "But are our missionaries capable?",
  "8753": "Where does he eat?",
  "8754": "Who was this new, radiant being who had won to existence out of the mist and darkness of our fears?",
  "8755": "I wonder where that ship comes from?",
  "8756": "What gentleman is this?",
  "8757": "Just lend me your scarf, will you?",
  "8758": "But what can they intend to do with the poor creature, and how shall I ever meet her again?",
  "8759": "Says the coroner, is that boy here?",
  "8760": "No kidding?",
  "8761": "If there be no life, the same as the animal's life in the vegetables, how could animals sustain their lives feeding on vegetables?",
  "8762": "Do you think there will be?",
  "8763": "Things fo' me?",
  "8764": "And you would wish me to advance some money?",
  "8765": "Now what is there in her?",
  "8766": "Does it follow that the preferences of love and friendship are unjust?",
  "8767": "But then, where could it be?",
  "8768": "Oh, you mean a change?",
  "8769": "Did you see a man in the pit?",
  "8770": "Do you think they'll object?",
  "8771": "Then there is nothing impossible or out of the order of nature in our finding a guardian who has a similar combination of qualities?",
  "8772": "Will you come back to me?",
  "8773": "And I think a glass of wine will not be disagreeable to you?",
  "8774": "What's that, a dog?",
  "8775": "How did you know I was in service?",
  "8776": "So you can stay here and trifle around with some one else?",
  "8777": "What could I do with myself?",
  "8778": "Then the just is like the wise and good, and the unjust like the evil and ignorant?",
  "8779": "Who can he be?",
  "8780": "How can we possibly be anything else?",
  "8781": "You have a theory?",
  "8782": "And do you think now that she could undertake a voyage of some extent?",
  "8783": "Do you suppose I should contend against the most valiant sword in the kingdom?",
  "8784": "A lesson?",
  "8785": "Justified yourself, have you?",
  "8786": "What is a LEGISLATIVE power, but a power of making LAWS?",
  "8787": "And how is the book entitled?",
  "8788": "What was all the trouble about?",
  "8789": "With those studs?",
  "8790": "Have you lost your heart?",
  "8791": "What did he do?",
  "8792": "If you could live in a star, which one would you pick?",
  "8793": "But would he?",
  "8794": "For heaven's sake what have you done?",
  "8795": "Who, after such brilliant examples of our annihilating justice, who dare accuse us of forbearance?",
  "8796": "How explain, how find out her wishes?",
  "8797": "What then remained for me to do?",
  "8798": "You refer to the possible hindrances from want of health?",
  "8799": "What other hardier pioneer would come, hatchet in hand, to cut down the dark copses?",
  "8800": "Ever been kicked?",
  "8801": "Well, how do YOU explain it?",
  "8802": "And to what penalty do you think the king will be condemned?",
  "8803": "Why was my heart so faint?",
  "8804": "How has that contest gone?",
  "8805": "Then you did not see either of them?",
  "8806": "Then why are you leaving?",
  "8807": "On what occasion would it be most probable that such a presentation would be made?",
  "8808": "Then why does he follow you so with his eyes, and get you so frequently alone with him, and keep you so continually at his side?",
  "8809": "Perhaps you have some special information?",
  "8810": "Then how in the name of all that is wonderful did you get these facts?",
  "8811": "And is not this enough to prove that the establishment of equal toleration was not his plan?",
  "8812": "What is the sun?",
  "8813": "Had he a hat?",
  "8814": "After all, the question is still where?",
  "8815": "But what happened to you?",
  "8816": "Where do the sailor live?",
  "8817": "Are we happy because we are good, or are we good because we are happy?",
  "8818": "How, pray?",
  "8819": "Your letters?",
  "8820": "Or in love with the professor's wife?",
  "8821": "How can you hope to reform her after the life she has led?",
  "8822": "For what reason?",
  "8823": "What can be the matter?",
  "8824": "What mystery was this?",
  "8825": "How, in a month?",
  "8826": "You did not let the executioner escape, then?",
  "8827": "Oh, where are you going?",
  "8828": "Where lies this dim necessity of thrusting upon women the burdens of the suffrage?",
  "8829": "Where were you yesterday afternoon?",
  "8830": "Have you a sister?",
  "8831": "Is the general going to dismiss me?",
  "8832": "Why will you not let yourself be guided by those who are older and wiser than you?",
  "8833": "Have you chosen a post in which you might be of service to your neighbor?",
  "8834": "Is this house all yours, or joint property?",
  "8835": "Shall I be damned?",
  "8836": "What can have happened to him?",
  "8837": "In this prison that I am going to so unjustly, shall I have some free communication with the world outside?",
  "8838": "What could he reply when asked wherefore, and with what motive, he had been found alone in the night, armed with a sword, in the thickest of the wood?",
  "8839": "Is it not just, however, that they should have their reward, on account of these?",
  "8840": "What sort of cloth is it?",
  "8841": "How does the mortal world go?",
  "8842": "What are you going to say?",
  "8843": "But you can sleep when you please, monsieur?",
  "8844": "But what extraordinary tumult do I hear?",
  "8845": "Doctor, am I not to go with you?",
  "8846": "These volcanoes, however, were at one time in a state of activity?",
  "8847": "Disturbed her?",
  "8848": "Why do you attribute to me a wish for anything that would annoy you?",
  "8849": "Could something have happened out there to keep her away?",
  "8850": "Who'll look after you on this ship?",
  "8851": "The cargo on board?",
  "8852": "Why will they leave us some regret?",
  "8853": "Why, did not I tell you she had been stolen from me?",
  "8854": "When, oh when, would his new clothes be ready?",
  "8855": "Say when shall it be?",
  "8856": "Would it be to promote emancipation?",
  "8857": "Why is it that we see no therns?",
  "8858": "Call you that hope, your highness?",
  "8859": "What fault do you find with her?",
  "8860": "Why was his brow clammy with drops of moisture, his knees shaking beneath him, and his soul oppressed with a cold gloom?",
  "8861": "Why is she wandering alone through these mountains?",
  "8862": "If we reject it now, is there any human probability that we shall ever see again so propitious a set of circumstances to bring about the same results?",
  "8863": "Was it indeed a house of death to which I had come, too late?",
  "8864": "Where is that?",
  "8865": "And those who govern ought not to be lovers of the task?",
  "8866": "Why should a man like you go about telling lies in this way?",
  "8867": "And if he could not resist ME, do you think his daughter could resist HIM?",
  "8868": "Why could he not remember the name when he was told the first time?",
  "8869": "Vortex?",
  "8870": "What am I to believe?",
  "8871": "Glad?",
  "8872": "But what the deuce did they DO?",
  "8873": "And it's not such a very bad house, is it?",
  "8874": "Do you wish to sleep with us?",
  "8875": "Sperrit?",
  "8876": "Why were those eyes so sunken?",
  "8877": "What kind of a legist is he who declaims when he ought to reason, who continually mistakes his metaphors for legal axioms, and who does not so much as know how to obtain a universal by induction, and form a category?",
  "8878": "Well, what should I say to the king?",
  "8879": "Is there immediate danger?",
  "8880": "Eyes of an admirable expression?",
  "8881": "But how do you make it out?",
  "8882": "And she?",
  "8883": "How did he get the money to buy this house, allow me to ask?",
  "8884": "Do you always draw like that?",
  "8885": "Why attempt to describe the terrible scene which ensued?",
  "8886": "Why, it is seven o'clock?",
  "8887": "You'll promise me you will do this for me?",
  "8888": "How many years have passed since then?",
  "8889": "Because she's so handsome?",
  "8890": "Do you think I could forget that?",
  "8891": "Where does this diligence run?",
  "8892": "Why fight at all?",
  "8893": "Do you think she wants to order something of him?",
  "8894": "Did you never hear talk of a young woman who was carried off one night?",
  "8895": "Should he climb the other ridge, or wander along the hollow?",
  "8896": "How did he manage to buy this house?",
  "8897": "Was it a knell for his lost soul, chasing him through the empty streets and beginning already an eternal punishment of terror?",
  "8898": "What is to be settled?",
  "8899": "Do you mean of dislike?",
  "8900": "If that is not a horror, what is?",
  "8901": "Who knows but this may be deemed right below?",
  "8902": "The sentiment is strong, then?",
  "8903": "Is your soul alive?",
  "8904": "Wildeve?",
  "8905": "And so you would explode confirmation and marriage altogether?",
  "8906": "You think I may hope?",
  "8907": "Do you know the young man?",
  "8908": "What means he, sir?",
  "8909": "Who set you the tasks?",
  "8910": "What is that, said they?",
  "8911": "You think a great deal about the improvement of youth?",
  "8912": "You've relieved your feelings?",
  "8913": "What good?",
  "8914": "Will that ever be?",
  "8915": "Can we get it right away?",
  "8916": "Do you think so, sir?",
  "8917": "Know the road at all?",
  "8918": "Will they not sign it?",
  "8919": "My husband?",
  "8920": "What's this about the girl you say is leaving?",
  "8921": "And the wager?",
  "8922": "Can you guess what it is?",
  "8923": "How say you now?",
  "8924": "Morrel, can you intend it in my house, under my very eyes?",
  "8925": "Why should he have got into any argument about the validity of these orders?",
  "8926": "Do you notice how it exalts everything?",
  "8927": "Think it?",
  "8928": "What good is it?",
  "8929": "Is it you?",
  "8930": "You approve of my going away for years, then, and never coming here again till I have made myself of some mark in the world?",
  "8931": "In this emergency what are the contending parties doing?",
  "8932": "Must they devour each other?",
  "8933": "What do you say, mother?",
  "8934": "Is it wrong to watch the kingfisher seeking his nest?",
  "8935": "Where are you going to now?",
  "8936": "We're on the right track, I think?",
  "8937": "You would not inform?",
  "8938": "There is such a person, then?",
  "8939": "Who in this universe?",
  "8940": "Or who would with any patience hear his friends, if they should presume to defend his government as not arbitrary and tyrannical?",
  "8941": "Once more, he said, what ruler is there of the elements of human nature other than the soul, and especially the wise soul?",
  "8942": "Then why not be more careful than him?",
  "8943": "And yet?",
  "8944": "Get my letter?",
  "8945": "Why this great sin?",
  "8946": "Has he eaten today, or does he hunt empty?",
  "8947": "Why is there so little fate in your looks?",
  "8948": "On the contrary, does he not evidently perceive, that from the union of these points there results an object, which is compounded and divisible, and may be distinguished into two parts, of which each preserves its existence distinct and separate, notwithstanding its contiguity to the other?",
  "8949": "What part would they want me to take?",
  "8950": "And has your business been attended to in your absence?",
  "8951": "He's there, is he?",
  "8952": "I may use that freedom with your name?",
  "8953": "Chops, eh?",
  "8954": "But if you saw him so seldom and wrote so seldom, how did he know enough about your affairs to be able to help you, as you say that he has done?",
  "8955": "Postponed for good, I hope?",
  "8956": "His former lackey?",
  "8957": "Who are you fellows on the ground there?",
  "8958": "Will you be happy when I am in the earth?",
  "8959": "Why did I myself keep it from you?",
  "8960": "And that cursed projectile has fallen?",
  "8961": "Would he who could gain such a prize crave other riches his whole life long?",
  "8962": "And is it any better with the gentry?",
  "8963": "How can you be such a naughty boy and your poor mother just laid in her grave this very day?",

  "8965": "Shall we refuse them?",
  "8966": "How do you know how he behaves?",
  "8967": "Where is the relation between the cause supposed and the effect obtained?",
  "8968": "What does it mean?",
  "8969": "What could be the matter with the handsome fellow?",
  "8970": "Will that content you?",
  "8971": "What had caused it?",
  "8972": "Ay?",
  "8973": "Can I believe my ears?",
  "8974": "Yet, would they meet again?",
  "8975": "Whether he could come out by force at the opera, and succeed by violence?",
  "8976": "Are you going to look for some ass that has been lost?",
  "8977": "What is NOT the matter?",
  "8978": "Who says so?",
  "8979": "How about your letters?",
  "8980": "You mean that you want to get away from me, after I've been to all the trouble and expense of teaching you the business?",
  "8981": "Moreover, what is an obscure corner in such a submersion of joy?",
  "8982": "And who told you?",
  "8983": "What do we know about what she feels?",
  "8984": "Will he know from use whether or no his drawing is correct or beautiful?",
  "8985": "What could the weddineers do?",
  "8986": "I an impostor?",
  "8987": "How do you explain it?",
  "8988": "Why did he not tell them his name?",
  "8989": "Do you think you will be able to guide the bubble?",
  "8990": "Short or tall?",
  "8991": "A mason ?",
  "8992": "What made you get up so early?",
  "8993": "But I want her to be here within an hour, do you hear?",
  "8994": "How does she look at it, do you think?",
  "8995": "Their names?",
  "8996": "Then you disapprove of duelling?",
  "8997": "Did I give you this?",
  "8998": "Had the boy a bicycle?",
  "8999": "What do you want with it?",
  "9000": "And the maker's name?",
  "9001": "For my father?",
  "9002": "And you are aware too that the latter cannot explain what they mean by knowledge, but are obliged after all to say knowledge of the good?",
  "9003": "Bickersteth?",
  "9004": "Have you not heard that some one is coming here?",
  "9005": "Can its cannonade us at the bottom of the sea?",
  "9006": "What do you say hangs about you?",
  "9007": "Poulter?",
  "9008": "Why were things always mismanaged in her house?",
  "9009": "Is it irrational for the larger group to set such influences to work by holding the lesser group responsible in its collective capacity?",
  "9010": "Will any man try it?",
  "9011": "My den?",
  "9012": "Well, and what more?",
  "9013": "How long are you going to stay?",
  "9014": "But suppose you do not come back?",
  "9015": "Why are we not together as we were last summer, in your big study, on the blue sofa, the confidential sofa?",
  "9016": "Where else, madame?",
  "9017": "How, I reveal it?",
  "9018": "And be good to her, do you hear?",
  "9019": "Must this melancholy parallelism be yet more completely verified?",
  "9020": "Monotonous?",
  "9021": "But who has handsomer, better children than ours?",
  "9022": "Is it not a beautiful name?",
  "9023": "In what way can I have been made a prisoner?",
  "9024": "Did I say that?",
  "9025": "What were YOU expecting we'd found?",
  "9026": "Will both abide the censure of my doome?",
  "9027": "Why were men saved?",
  "9028": "Where was its wonderful roundness and beauty?",
  "9029": "Have I brought out of the solution according to the wishes or the foresight of your royal highness?",
  "9030": "To what last degree?",
  "9031": "Must we control a situation entirely or only sufficiently to be able to carry out a specific mission?",
  "9032": "What is the matter, if you please?",
  "9033": "What fly has stung you?",
  "9034": "Are you coming up?",
  "9035": "Why does monsieur ask?",
  "9036": "So you've smelt me out, have you, and come for your fee?",
  "9037": "Who cares for his forgiveness?",
  "9038": "Comes to our not being able to help her?",
  "9039": "Then they had your orders for what they do?",
  "9040": "Could we not both speak at the same time?",
  "9041": "What tale are you telling me?",
  "9042": "Death?",
  "9043": "Where can we find another sword?",
  "9044": "Did you ever trouble to see who called for them?",
  "9045": "Did the king, then, die childless?",
  "9046": "It's all right my staying a day with you?",
  "9047": "Suppose they do take up a case what does it amount to?",
  "9048": "Why, in naming the most amiable, cannot I recall them and myself also to that happy age in which our moments, pleasing as innocent, were passed with such happiness together?",
  "9049": "May I see to it?",
  "9050": "Then where you are is, of all places, the one he will avoid?",

  "9070": "But could not fasten?",
  "9071": "What are your sentiments?",
  "9072": "You impudent rascal, dare you say so to my face?",
  "9073": "Whither are you going?",
  "9074": "Who indeed?",
  "9075": "How was it I had never observed her before?",
  "9076": "However, ought I to have been astonished at the answer?",
  "9077": "Careless, and touched in the temper?",
  "9078": "Well, boy, any signs of such a foundation?",
  "9079": "Can you see anything there?",
  "9080": "Do you know, I could not stand living in this house for even a month?",
  "9081": "Have you ever been to sea?",
  "9082": "Have I, then, two lives, that, after I have wasted one in the service of others, there may yet remain to me a second, which I may live unto myself?",
  "9083": "Do you not want to know who has taken it?",
  "9084": "What if the house were closed in darkness?",
  "9085": "What are you, a man or a pumpkin?",
  "9086": "We shall always think well of each other, and why should we not be friends?",
  "9087": "Who could have done this?",
  "9088": "Where may he be found?",
  "9089": "Why gratefully?",
  "9090": "Was it with that intention you followed me?",
  "9091": "And are you going to leave me at such a time?",
  "9092": "Is this a very terrible person?",
  "9093": "Where is she staying now?",
  "9094": "How is it I am not moving?",
  "9095": "Are you jesting with me?",
  "9096": "No notice?",
  "9097": "Then you are not going to demand any money of me?",
  "9098": "Have I no power for good, with you, at all?",
  "9099": "Are you ready, friends?",
  "9100": "Not my flight?",
  "9101": "What door?",
  "9102": "Can I have seen him abroad?",
  "9103": "How deep is it?",
  "9104": "What was she thinking of doing?",
  "9105": "Besides, who knew that some foreign marksman might not pot the censor?",
  "9106": "Is it thus you reply to me?",
  "9107": "Will you take me to her?",
  "9108": "So novel?",
  "9109": "What you say here about virtue and justice and institutions and laws being the best things among men?",
  "9110": "What does one want with dusty economic, books, which have made the world no better, or with mother's hideous chiffoniers?",
  "9111": "Then do they not love each other now?",
  "9112": "Shall I open it?",
  "9113": "Which dress am I to get ready?",
  "9114": "It would be an impertinence elsewhere, but it is not so here, to ask your name and condition?",
  "9115": "Why not choose one among the many paths to distinction which untried life held out so temptingly, and take his chance of success as others had done before him?",
  "9116": "Besides, are we ever obliged?",
  "9117": "Why are you always puttering?",
  "9118": "What is the character of the addresses?",
  "9119": "That, then, is your opinion?",
  "9120": "Will you sell me a fish?",
  "9121": "Not dare to spit on it?",
  "9122": "Are you going to be my servant?",
  "9123": "What is its duty?",
  "9124": "But, peradventure, it may be sagaciously urged, how is this?",
  "9125": "And yet how many might I not have been guilty of?",
  "9126": "Do not I tell you she will be your sister?",
  "9127": "So he was not there?",
  "9128": "What are you thinking of, eh?",
  "9129": "However, did I find you out?",
  "9130": "Whither now would they goad him?",
  "9131": "But is the thing settled between you or not?",
  "9132": "So it does not please you to work?",
  "9133": "Your savings?",
  "9134": "If you do not return, how does it concern you?",
  "9135": "How much is a plate of peas?",
  "9136": "Before?",
  "9137": "Would you not try to save her from suffering more even ifor would you?",
  "9138": "Why spoil such pleasant relations?",
  "9139": "Straker was brought back here, I presume?",
  "9140": "The only ones?",
  "9141": "Would he never get a good job?",
  "9142": "I fire first?",
  "9143": "Who has called?",
  "9144": "But why were they to suffer for what fellows in the higher line did?",
  "9145": "But why is my grandfather allowed to live?",
  "9146": "How was it that two guns were abandoned in the center?",
  "9147": "And how is it possible for me to do so?",
  "9148": "Did a minute suffice for all this?",
  "9149": "And of what room was it the key?",
  "9150": "And whose was the sixteenth?",
  "9151": "How can YOU be dull at a ball?",
  "9152": "Could I, tell me, do with such weak instruments the great things I meditate?",
  "9153": "My dear friend, will you shake me up a little?",
  "9154": "Is a bill of rights essential to liberty?",
  "9155": "One of those monsters was to bear her off into the darkness?",
  "9156": "How then?",
  "9157": "What on this earth could my wife be doing out on the country road at three in the morning?",
  "9158": "What has been the progress since that time?",
  "9159": "You really compare me to a baby girl?",
  "9160": "But what would the learned geographer say, when he heard the name and destination of the ship, in which he had taken passage?",
  "9161": "How could you deceive me so?",
  "9162": "Et hinc illæ iræ?",
  "9163": "You are not asleep?",
  "9164": "Do you know that he will soon be five years old?",
  "9165": "Means?",
  "9166": "Where will you go to?",
  "9167": "May not a more compact and advantageous position turn the scale on the same side, against a superior number so situated as to be less capable of a prompt and collected exertion of its strength?",
  "9168": "Where is she, you nasty whelp, where is she?",
  "9169": "Do you mean to say that you are not able to tell me what a surd is?",
  "9170": "With what justice can we complain, that great men will not look upon us, nor be at leisure to give our affairs such dispatch as we expect, when we will never do it to ourselves?",
  "9171": "Do you wish him to read it?",
  "9172": "Do you, or do you not believe that you will have to give an account for every idle word that you have ever spoken?",
  "9173": "And there are three kinds of pleasure, which are their several objects?",
  "9174": "What are the police spies?",
  "9175": "And what have you to support your minds withal?",
  "9176": "In spite of?",
  "9177": "Is he a shepherd or a nobleman?",
  "9178": "What is left?",
  "9179": "A hopfrog?",
  "9180": "You deny, then, the truth of the six articles?",
  "9181": "You think I might have been showing you that a little more handsomely?",
  "9182": "How do you do, my little gentleman?",
  "9183": "Which one was it?",
  "9184": "Will you do so?",
  "9185": "How long have you been back?",
  "9186": "Then, then what?",
  "9187": "Why do you think?",
  "9188": "And now who is it, my dear?",
  "9189": "Where is the hay dealer's?",
  "9190": "How should he have been otherwise?",
  "9191": "Where are you lodging?",
  "9192": "Will you promise me not to repeat a single word of what I am about to tell you?",
  "9193": "What can you mean?",
  "9194": "Or, if he accepted ti, would be in truth be studying her interests?",
  "9195": "What's the row there?",
  "9196": "Can you hope, that the legions will respect a weak old man, whose days have been spent in the shade of peace and retirement?",
  "9197": "What would you think if you HAD to live all of your life in that jungle as our forest man has done?",
  "9198": "Or a healed one?",
  "9199": "But has the wounded man retained his senses?",
  "9200": "You think, then, that aerostatic science has said its last word?",
  "9201": "By what conditions is production effected?",
  "9202": "Snap?",
  "9203": "What are you looking at there?",
  "9204": "And go to the theater, truly?",
  "9205": "Prove it to whom?",
  "9206": "Does any state actually make it a practice to treat its neighbor as itself?",
  "9207": "What do you most wish for?",
  "9208": "Somebody?",
  "9209": "May I know the others?",
  "9210": "If he did marry, how was he to live?",
  "9211": "How long were you engaged?",
  "9212": "Do they give you a free hand here?",
  "9213": "Well, gentlemen, are you determined to go on this cruise?",
  "9214": "Would you like, for the sake of clearness, to distinguish which are the necessary and which are the unnecessary pleasures?",
  "9215": "Why do you tremble so violently?",
  "9216": "Do you keep a dog?",
  "9217": "And by whom is this order given?",
  "9218": "And your companions, where are they?",
  "9219": "Could not something be made of this man under good influences?",
  "9220": "Oh, merciful heavens, was I not accessory to his death by my supine insensibility, by my contempt for him, not remembering, or not willing to remember, that it was for my sake he had become a traitor and a perjurer?",
  "9221": "And the royal and orderly desires are nearest?",
  "9222": "Say, then, is not pleasure opposed to pain?",
  "9223": "Why not sow all?",
  "9224": "Who told you that?",
  "9225": "Complaint, sir?",
  "9226": "And would you call justice vice?",
  "9227": "But what am I to do if I love her?",
  "9228": "But what do I care for the laws of nature and arithmetic, when, for some reason I dislike those laws and the fact that twice two makes four?",
  "9229": "What was the nature of his apathy?",
  "9230": "But how in the name of wonder did you come here, and what have you been doing?",
  "9231": "Woodcourt?",
  "9232": "Should he force himself on this happiness?",
  "9233": "And which of his friends were with him?",
  "9234": "And what are its defences?",
  "9235": "You sold me a rapier, did you not?",
  "9236": "But, what on earth is their meaning?",
  "9237": "How was he to get out?",
  "9238": "Have you found your first day's work harder than you expected?",
  "9239": "And what was his object?",
  "9240": "Have you heard of it, either of you?",
  "9241": "Ah, indeed?",
  "9242": "Because you are sorry to leave it?",
  "9243": "Shall we get into that boat, then, and push off?",
  "9244": "The whole of it?",
  "9245": "Even under this disguise?",
  "9246": "That I should plead their seuerall actions?",
  "9247": "Then you will appear?",
  "9248": "Do you play?",
  "9249": "Whose but his own?",
  "9250": "You have formed a conclusion?",
  "9251": "Is not the exact opposite the truth?",
  "9252": "The other world?",
  "9253": "Shall I call him by his name?",
  "9254": "How did you obtain these details?",
  "9255": "Do you live there?",
  "9256": "Hauskuld tells who he is, and asked what guests might be there in the house?",
  "9257": "Was it really true that all were dead?",
  "9258": "Why should he have taken to his heels?",
  "9259": "What more?",
  "9260": "But if it amused my father?",
  "9261": "And how long does it subsist?",
  "9262": "Then you are not in the habit of bolting your door every night before you get into bed?",
  "9263": "Will they forge you the sword of your deliverance, will they marshal you the army and lead it to the fray?",
  "9264": "If so, that alone would hardly alter the matter, for what could she give in return?",
  "9265": "To leave you?",
  "9266": "Have you had a good journey?",
  "9267": "When was it ever otherwise?",
  "9268": "Do you know the impression your words give me?",
  "9269": "Is it, indeed, sir?",
  "9270": "Can you be ignorant that the council always act with moderation and respect towards ambassadors, but that the people are full of ambition and great designs?",
  "9271": "Do you wish me to tell you what to do with it?",
  "9272": "Why, sir?",
  "9273": "Have the suitors returned, or are they still waiting over yonder, to take me on my way home?",
  "9274": "Why should it not roll onwards, like the moon, a dark cold mass in space?",
  "9275": "Is it proper for men to say it and not for women?",
  "9276": "D'you want to go to bed already?",
  "9277": "And what is it that he wants?",
  "9278": "What are you afraid of?",
  "9279": "You are in a great hurry, then?",
  "9280": "What more can I tell you, dear?",
  "9281": "How can we?",
  "9282": "Do you mind, dear?",
  "9283": "But he never brought light into anything quite so dark as this?",
  "9284": "But WHAT is worse?",
  "9285": "What time is it?",
  "9286": "Is it only the guilty whose honor is at the sport of others, sir?",
  "9287": "Do you know the best of gettin' ashore again?",
  "9288": "And what do you think he was doing?",
  "9289": "What's one to do, my dear?",
  "9290": "And what shall I wear?",
  "9291": "What was she like?",
  "9292": "Why, there is not a function of a single organ in the body which has not been determined wholly and solely by experiment?",
  "9293": "You were just looking for an opportunity to throw me over and you took that one?",
  "9294": "The big house near the sea, you mean?",
  "9295": "Is it not the idea which is developed through it, the emotion with which it vibrates, which expands, elevates and ennobles it?",
  "9296": "All over?",
  "9297": "Is he going to die?",
  "9298": "My foundation laid on earth for a mansion in heaven?",
  "9299": "Shall one raging hand thus level all?",
  "9300": "Gluttony?",
  "9301": "Why should any one want to ask such questions, after an address like that?",
  "9302": "Is the authority of man over man just?",
  "9303": "Is he religious?",
  "9304": "How much could I lose if things went wrong?",
  "9305": "On the west coast?",
  "9306": "What good do they do us?",
  "9307": "Where is reason?",
  "9308": "And what does it matter, now you're here to protect me?",
  "9309": "Who has occupied it the night before?",
  "9310": "Ten o'clock at night?",
  "9311": "The bottle must go somewhere, and why not here as well as anywhere else?",
  "9312": "Then the lover of wisdom has a great advantage over the lover of gain, for he has a double experience?",
  "9313": "But where is the misfortune in this?",
  "9314": "See us looking, now, at you?",
  "9315": "What remedy can there be for this situation, but in a change of the system which has produced it in a change of the fallacious and delusive system of quotas and requisitions?",
  "9316": "Was it this that made her ill?",
  "9317": "Excuse me, prince, but what are your arrangements?",
  "9318": "Do not whole scales of colors invisibly exist above and below the limits of our retinal sensibility?",
  "9319": "Have you ever had a difference with a dear friend?",
  "9320": "You came upon a private quarrel?",
  "9321": "What, if the idea should come to him in his madness that it would be well for him to slay his wife and his children?",
  "9322": "Oh, fie, now shall I just tell you why you came here today?",
  "9323": "To whom is it degrading?",
  "9324": "Where are you lodging, monsieur?",
  "9325": "But did your reverence hear of the portent that was seen last night?",
  "9326": "What do you say to that show of sense?",
  "9327": "Do you accept the commission which I have intrusted to you?",
  "9328": "Have I forgotten myself so far that I have not even told you his name?",
  "9329": "What was to be done after the crowning of the king?",
  "9330": "Have you not got enough corn of your own?",
  "9331": "We might ask, why it should be a greater proof of insanity in men to set a high value on rare tulips than on rare stones, which are neither more useful nor more beautiful?",
  "9332": "Is it your pleasure, most dear father, that you speak?",
  "9333": "And what will you do about it?",
  "9334": "And what have they promised?",
  "9335": "Mole?",
  "9336": "Did it do you any good?",
  "9337": "Can you get out?",
  "9338": "Have I to do with men of straw?",
  "9339": "Where was the monk going?",
  "9340": "Did we come up or down stream?",
  "9341": "The cave?",
  "9342": "Now should they undertake it immediately, and devote this day to it?",
  "9343": "Did the woman keep her oath?",
  "9344": "But who can tell you the real truth of the matter?",
  "9345": "What solution will result later from these data?",
  "9346": "Then you were not merely jesting?",
  "9347": "But how had she learned?",
  "9348": "For their ransom?",
  "9349": "What else, sir?",
  "9350": "Is it entirely true that the vote has necessarily and really these inherent magical powers of rapid education for individuals and for classes of men, fitting them, in default of other qualifications, for the high responsibilities of suffrage?",
  "9351": "How, in short, reconcile what the progress already accomplished has had the effect of rendering irreconcilable?",
  "9352": "Is it a wreck?",
  "9353": "Your secretary?",
  "9354": "What in the world SHOULD it be?",
  "9355": "Shall I not have back the equivalent of his robbery?",
  "9356": "Where was it found?",
  "9357": "What did he give you for thus serving him?",
  "9358": "Is it possible that she has recognised me?",
  "9359": "Are you the boy whom I saw playing in the stacks last week?",
  "9360": "Shall I show you his apartments?",
  "9361": "The meaning, monsieur?",
  "9362": "You really advise it?",
  "9363": "Then we will let it take its chance?",
  "9364": "You are aware it will be war, civil war, furious, devouring, implacable?",
  "9365": "What respect then can be paid to that which describes nothing, and which means nothing?",
  "9366": "And then what?",
  "9367": "What happeneth unto me?",
  "9368": "But, oh, is he on land or sea?",
  "9369": "And what are you doing with it?",
  "9370": "Fletcher?",
  "9371": "What COULD I do?",
  "9372": "Is it large?",
  "9373": "Have you indeed decided?",
  "9374": "What are we to do with her?",
  "9375": "It seems then he bears a very changing sail?",
  "9376": "I say, have you got your mules ready?",
  "9377": "What does scandal signify to me?",
  "9378": "D'you know what sort of a practice this is?",
  "9379": "Ah, who, who?",
  "9380": "And therefore has neither more nor less of discord, nor yet of harmony?",
  "9381": "Let you be going down the markets, and what would you see for sale?",
  "9382": "And she had the right to live in your house and use your things?",
  "9383": "Pray where are their hens?",
  "9384": "Now, that is what he said, or to that purpose, was it not?",
  "9385": "What do you want with him?",
  "9386": "Or what usually happens, in case any one refuses payment of this tribute?",
  "9387": "What doth it profit a man to gain the whole world if he suffer the loss of his immortal soul?",
  "9388": "Her singing was less remarkable?",
  "9389": "Drunk?",
  "9390": "Are you pleased with what you have heard?",
  "9391": "Do you lock yourself up from me, to make my search more curious?",
  "9392": "Now, did the dogs act thus from the experience of each individual, or from the example of the older and wiser dogs, or from an inherited habit, that is from instinct?",
  "9393": "And a choice of what?",
  "9394": "Are you all right here?",
  "9395": "But what were these fatigues, what did the wounds matter?",
  "9396": "My business?",
  "9397": "What else do you hear?",
  "9398": "Not worth speaking of?",
  "9399": "Would the boat, however, resist more shocks of this kind?",
  "9400": "You will not fail me at the next term with the rest?",
  "9401": "He brings his right arm up, jist across his face, and passes on, with a knowin nod of his head, as much as to say, how do you do?",
  "9402": "Why are the birds all perching together over there?",
  "9403": "Do you wish to have an idea of their appearance?",
  "9404": "What is it for you?",
  "9405": "Of course you know that ambition and avarice are held to be, as indeed they are, a disgrace?",
  "9406": "What does a man learn by travelling?",
  "9407": "Then what is it for?",
  "9408": "As to the autonomy of the village communities, what could be retained of it after so many blows?",
  "9409": "You know that there is another man then?",
  "9410": "Is she still in town?",
  "9411": "Do you think that I would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death?",
  "9412": "When will he come back?",
  "9413": "How should she know his parts?",
  "9414": "And you were saying, sire?",
  "9415": "Have you got your thick boots on, and something warm under your cloak?",
  "9416": "How could we bid them hither?",
  "9417": "Well, how about your case?",
  "9418": "Speak how?",
  "9419": "And is not life to be reckoned among the ends of the soul?",
  "9420": "Who slammed the door?",
  "9421": "What does all this mean?",
  "9422": "What is the good of such rules?",
  "9423": "Or had you rather forfeit your kingdom, your treasures, and your life?",
  "9424": "How are you going to manage that, captain?",
  "9425": "Did she stand the journey well?",
  "9426": "What business had she to go away?",
  "9427": "Why poor?",
  "9428": "But it had not approached the body?",
  "9429": "Where did you place it?",
  "9430": "My lord, you loue her?",
  "9431": "And what would you do in return?",
  "9432": "Ah, but madame, does mankind ever lose anything?",
  "9433": "Not heard of him, perhaps?",
  "9434": "The king's room?",
  "9435": "Am I a servant?",
  "9436": "What do we do next?",
  "9437": "Had this mysterious being, whatever he was, whose existence could not be denied, abandoned the island?",
  "9438": "He has confessed it to you yourself?",
  "9439": "What has the wretch been doing to him?",
  "9440": "To me?",
  "9441": "What was the sound?",
  "9442": "Is equality coming, or inequality going?",
  "9443": "Is there no such thing as a gentleman?",
  "9444": "What is your name, boy?",
  "9445": "But, sir, are you sure he is as guilty as they say?",
  "9446": "From where does she hail?",
  "9447": "Further, I said, has not a drunken man also the spirit of a tyrant?",
  "9448": "Why do you, a stranger coming into my rooms at this time of the night, ask that question?",
  "9449": "What did they want from him?",
  "9450": "Who shall still appoint what shall be discoursed, what presumed, and no further?",
  "9451": "Who?",
  "9452": "Tell me, now, if persistence is not a virtue?",
  "9453": "What, it may be asked, is the true spirit of the institution itself?",
  "9454": "Does his crew drink air?",
  "9455": "Is not this your opinion, gentlemen?",
  "9456": "Did you notice that sort of flash or flicker the candle gave before it was extinguished?",
  "9457": "On our account?",
  "9458": "Have you studied the habits of hens?",
  "9459": "Is that the sun I see shining, my friend?",
  "9460": "How is it you do?",
  "9461": "Could it be possible that the place was peculiarly unpropitious to her comfort?",
  "9462": "Can they be coming at me?",
  "9463": "Snow at this time?",
  "9464": "What, can he steal, that you demand so much?",
  "9465": "If it was so, was she not bound to show her this letter?",
  "9466": "Suppose we all go away?",
  "9467": "And what is the engagement?",
  "9468": "At what point does deception blossom out into the unmistakable lie?",
  "9469": "Do you want any music?",
  "9470": "A ewe's a small thing, but what would you give me if I did wed him and did save you so?",
  "9471": "You pretend to be ignorant?",
  "9472": "Would you like to read a letter I had from him this morning?",
  "9473": "Did you get very wet?",
  "9474": "Did she see him often?",
  "9475": "Do you particularly like the man?",
  "9476": "Look?",
  "9477": "Is he asleep?",
  "9478": "And if each is one, and both are two, she will conceive the two as in a state of division, for if there were undivided they could only be conceived of as one?",
  "9479": "What could they do, did she think?",
  "9480": "Can I help you now?",
  "9481": "How do they live?",
  "9482": "This beast, I rather conclude, friend, is not of home raising, but is from foreign lands, or perhaps from the little island itself over the blue water?",
  "9483": "Do they hop?",
  "9484": "Would it not then have been the same if he had died of a fever or of the small pox, of old age, or of anything else?",
  "9485": "In order not to involve the social wealth in an unlimited and consequently disastrous solidarity, will they content themselves with imposing rules upon the spirit of invention and enterprise?",
  "9486": "Is not that a perfect and lofty love?",
  "9487": "But was she here when the lady came?",
  "9488": "Do I talk nonsense if I wish to recover my money?",
  "9489": "Are these plains composed of arid sand, as the first astronomer maintained?",
  "9490": "Alive and well?",
  "9491": "You have some plan, then?",
  "9492": "How could he answer to such an appeal?",
  "9493": "Do you think the poison he fell a victim to was intended for him?",
  "9494": "Shall we get on with our work?",
  "9495": "Mean to say he knowed nothing of you?",
  "9496": "Have you lost your wits?",
  "9497": "What wreck?",
  "9498": "Would you be good enough to turn your face to the window?",
  "9499": "And why had I these aspirations and these regrets?",
  "9500": "So you have a lodging?",
  "9501": "Go away with you?",
  "9502": "This is not your writing?",
  "9503": "For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?",
  "9504": "Who told me to love her?",
  "9505": "And is that all you can say for him?",
  "9506": "When is the time?",
  "9507": "What is this, my dear?",
  "9508": "What if I were to try such and such a thing?",
  "9509": "How can she conceal the intrigue from other people's eyes?",
  "9510": "And the persons whose property is taken from them are compelled to defend themselves before the people as they best can?",
  "9511": "Do they, when they put to flight, as it is said, disorders that have baffled the powers of medicine, work in conformity to the light of reason?",
  "9512": "Have you the keys to those two doors?",
  "9513": "You understand that, I hope?",
  "9514": "Who is happy?",
  "9515": "And, if natural, may it not be assumed to be proper and right?",
  "9516": "Who talks of dying?",
  "9517": "Can they be saved when the army has gone?",
  "9518": "Can it harm my lover for me to live on after he is dead, if I take no pleasure in anything but in the woe I bear for him?",
  "9519": "Will you only say that you have been mistaken, and that I may depend on your not acting secretly in future?",
  "9520": "Was it for this, however, that his visits to the farm formed a delightful exception to the meagre occupations of his life?",
  "9521": "An instance?",
  "9522": "But will you go with me to gain the pardons?",
  "9523": "And if her ships are not to be admitted into our harbours, I would ask, how is she to protect us?",
  "9524": "And the more detestable his actions are to the citizens the more satellites and the greater devotion in them will he require?",
  "9525": "Have you made him any promise that I must ratify?",
  "9526": "Am I not interrupting your conversation?",
  "9527": "Have you no fears lest your conduct should be misinterpreted?",
  "9528": "The big cake or the little deadlies?",
  "9529": "Will you swear to sacrifice even your lives in their defense, and to keep them always by your valor in the path to victory?",
  "9530": "Anything moving in the old place, mid I ask?",
  "9531": "Are you going to leave me?",
  "9532": "Surely you are mistaken about his trade?",
  "9533": "Can this be it?",
  "9534": "Lemonade, sir?",
  "9535": "Have I not shown my power?",
  "9536": "And how can she do so if, up to this minute, by your own statement, she is herself in ignorance of your knowledge?",
  "9537": "What do we know of the beauty they replace?",
  "9538": "Am I still superintendent?",
  "9539": "Why, what is there so terrific in the cavern?",
  "9540": "Then where did papa get it?",
  "9541": "Then, it is your opinion that our friend has perished in the waves?",
  "9542": "Do you really forgive me?",
  "9543": "What do I say?",
  "9544": "Did I frighten you so much?",
  "9545": "Are you here before me?",
  "9546": "But ought we to attempt to construct one?",
  "9547": "Have you seen a ooser?",
  "9548": "How do you know that?",
  "9549": "What, are you ready there?",
  "9550": "You know the hunt and chase?",
  "9551": "You at last?",
  "9552": "But, it will be asked, what kind of a treasure is this that we propose to bequeath to posterity?",
  "9553": "How do you get at that?",
  "9554": "Are you strong enough?",
  "9555": "Now, I want to hear you swear that you are not married to that woman?",
  "9556": "But what, then, is the noise?",
  "9557": "How did you conceive that idea?",
  "9558": "Now, do it look like it?",
  "9559": "Where can they be?",
  "9560": "Was he considering what pallet, what brushes, what canvas he must use, to introduce them into visible life through his art?",
  "9561": "What man would marry a girl so placed?",
  "9562": "To what end?",
  "9563": "Do you know?",
  "9564": "Or is it by the law courts and the judge?",
  "9565": "Whom had we to deal with?",
  "9566": "And yet there was one thing wanting in order to complete your happiness?",
  "9567": "Have the private emotions also their gutter press?",
  "9568": "Yes, but how came you here again?",
  "9569": "Are your doubts on that point too strong?",
  "9570": "Who you gwine to take to jail now?",
  "9571": "You, my lord?",
  "9572": "But who could help loving her?",
  "9573": "How so, if he love her?",
  "9574": "Was there anything unusual about the bodies?",
  "9575": "Would you be so good as tell us?",
  "9576": "Now, is it possible to reconstruct the series from which money seems to have been detached, and, consequently, restore the latter to its true principle?",
  "9577": "You told her that?",
  "9578": "And is it your cook who prepares these pills?",
  "9579": "Or do I have to hit you again?",
  "9580": "What are you giggling at?",
  "9581": "Does anybody believe it?",
  "9582": "Is it wrong to watch the moon, the stars?",
  "9583": "Does anyone know him by sight?",
  "9584": "Would she part with privileges which, once relinquished, could never be regained?",
  "9585": "Why should it be forgotten?",
  "9586": "Are you still sure to close up?",
  "9587": "Am I to let the troops have the oats, and to take a receipt for them?",
  "9588": "Had he in his turn succumbed?",
  "9589": "Anna, what is it for, why will you?",
  "9590": "Philanthropic?",
  "9591": "You remember what people say when they are sick?",
  "9592": "Do you often have this housewarming?",
  "9593": "There are forty years of work in me yet, and why should you despair?",
  "9594": "A tree?",
  "9595": "Are we going to tell him still that politics is a disreputable and useless form of human activity?",
  "9596": "And is it not needed whenever it helps us and hurts the enemy?",
  "9597": "If you put a question to a person in a right way, he will give a true answer of himself, but how could he do this unless there were knowledge and right reason already in him?",
  "9598": "Have you posts of profitable pecuniary emolument?",
  "9599": "How could such a state of things be kept secret?",
  "9600": "And do you still deem it a part of valor to die?",
  "9601": "But not about all?",
  "9602": "Had you any idea of his coming so soon?",
  "9603": "Did I not forbid you to show your face here for month?",
  "9604": "And am I not to learn his name?",
  "9605": "But what did it matter?",
  "9606": "So that now?",
  "9607": "Has she softened or hardened?",
  "9608": "We shall follow one or the other of these curves?",
  "9609": "How many other girls did you ever tell that?",
  "9610": "Whether it was a criminal act that I had committed?",
  "9611": "Your head is cool?",
  "9612": "Verver?",
  "9613": "What's that he said?",
  "9614": "Shall they be admitted?",
  "9615": "Have you been a soldier?",
  "9616": "Is not this an insult, pray?",
  "9617": "What can they have meant by this howling?",
  "9618": "Where was he before?",
  "9619": "He had no other calling?",
  "9620": "What character did I act?",
  "9621": "What sort of man are you?",
  "9622": "Helen, are you mad?",
  "9623": "What will be my fate?",
  "9624": "Ah, then you at length understand?",
  "9625": "I call it time, but how long was it?",
  "9626": "Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place?",
  "9627": "What the deuce?",
  "9628": "What, my friend?",
  "9629": "I hope there's nothing amiss?",
  "9630": "Do this look like a forge?",
  "9631": "To how much does the loss amount?",
  "9632": "Combat by regulations the degrading influence of parcellaire division?",
  "9633": "How's everything with you?",
  "9634": "Who may dogmatize in matters so involved?",
  "9635": "But who is the clerical appearing gentleman with him?",
  "9636": "And how do you propose to begin?",
  "9637": "Will you walk out with us?",
  "9638": "Hasbrouck?",
  "9639": "You say that she had a squint?",
  "9640": "And, think you, when he saw one of your feet out of the stirrup, he would wait for the other to be free?",
  "9641": "Ever since her womanhood almost, had she not been persecuted and undervalued?",
  "9642": "Why does he always take the narrow streets?",
  "9643": "Higher?",
  "9644": "Then how can you say you did not learn to see?",
  "9645": "Jane, what is it?",
  "9646": "Is it not true?",
  "9647": "Beresford?",
  "9648": "And have settled to marry him?",
  "9649": "Where's his nephew?",
  "9650": "Love, perhaps?",
  "9651": "Why, then, do you oppose a reform which, putting power in the hands of the people, would second your views so well?",
  "9652": "Have I hurt you?",
  "9653": "Have we no further need of them?",
  "9654": "Would you, now?",
  "9655": "How do I stand free of anything?",
  "9656": "But do you think I have a greater right than you have?",
  "9657": "What indefiniteness is there in the position?",
  "9658": "What awaits him beyond?",
  "9659": "But how about the case?",
  "9660": "How much is it worth?",
  "9661": "Mine honour?",
  "9662": "Oh, you've not been to see our school, have you?",
  "9663": "How did you come out?",
  "9664": "Would you dare to lift your hand to your queen?",
  "9665": "Are you weeping?",
  "9666": "What is it he is saying?",
  "9667": "Does the fifth, or the tenth century belong to the earlier centuries?",
  "9668": "Are you all ready?",
  "9669": "Where is there any approximation to it?",
  "9670": "Are we not two despairing creatures?",
  "9671": "What else do you expect?",
  "9672": "And is there anything finer than to SEARCH for one's own virtues?",
  "9673": "Mother, what is doing well?",
  "9674": "Why, how now, brother, who enforced this brawl?",
  "9675": "You know me now, I am sure?",
  "9676": "How much longer does that infernal sleuth intend to stay here?",
  "9677": "Can you cause that little trembling victim to be divorced from the woman who possesses him?",
  "9678": "Would she accept my sympathy?",
  "9679": "Have I not sunk into deep wells?",
  "9680": "Are you ready?",
  "9681": "How must she know?",
  "9682": "If morality be merely subjective, and there be no objective standard, how can you distinguish evil from good?",
  "9683": "Are they all cuckolds?",
  "9684": "What's your name, allow me to ask?",
  "9685": "Tell me, first, what am I to be?",
  "9686": "Can you do something for me?",
  "9687": "To what country?",
  "9688": "What but her shinin' brow?",
  "9689": "Oh, what can I do?",
  "9690": "Is the power who is jealous of our prosperity, a proper power to govern us?",
  "9691": "Why was it so unconscious and ladylike?",
  "9692": "Next month?",
  "9693": "What's the matter with this head?",
  "9694": "Then it attacks children?",
  "9695": "Did I not take this an hour ago?",
  "9696": "Who is that girl, and where did she come from?",
  "9697": "Why, what has he done?",
  "9698": "Why, if he is dead while he lives, should he fear that other death, through which alone he can behold wisdom in her purity?",
  "9699": "Which is my best cavalry horse?",
  "9700": "Do you know that, monsieur?",
  "9701": "What has she done for him?",
  "9702": "Do you expect my wife to take in soldiers' washing, or ride after the regiment in a baggage waggon?",
  "9703": "Is it not, with loss, too?",
  "9704": "What could a man require more from a nation so pliant and so prone to seek after knowledge?",
  "9705": "What is it I dream on?",
  "9706": "And when one sees the truth, what is one to do?",
  "9707": "You will grant me time to consider?",
  "9708": "Is he here still?",
  "9709": "I squeeze in between the bundles of clothing, and what do I see?",
  "9710": "What can it expect but crime and listlessness, offset here and there by the dogged struggles of the fortunate and more determined who are themselves buoyed by the hope that in due time the country will come to its senses?",
  "9711": "Then you'll help me?",
  "9712": "Are you quite certain that I know it?",
  "9713": "Are there any others?",
  "9714": "Of course they must be, for if they had not been, would they not have been bound to warn all who had anything to do with them of their deficiencies?",
  "9715": "What will you do with your accomplishments?",
  "9716": "Someone you were in love with?",
  "9717": "Still more pertinently, who was the moral woman?",
  "9718": "How fur is it?",
  "9719": "Well, but, my friend, is it not needful that I should?",
  "9720": "I mean, when you were growing up?",
  "9721": "Is it small wonder that I did not see through it?",
  "9722": "But what are the proofs?",
  "9723": "Are you not going to use my broom?",
  "9724": "Has he not demeaned himself twice?",
  "9725": "Can you understand now the source of the millions I am worth?",
  "9726": "For the water?",
  "9727": "Not for yourself, but for others from yourself, after what has happened?",
  "9728": "What do you mean, sir?",
  "9729": "Were they written by the persons to whom they are ascribed?",
  "9730": "Were you so frightened that you let go your jay?",
  "9731": "Has she?",
  "9732": "How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?",
  "9733": "Why have you brought all that smelly leather stuff into the house?",
  "9734": "Enough, do you think, to loosen that honest tongue of yours?",
  "9735": "I says to myself, shall I go to that doctor, private, and blow on these frauds?",
  "9736": "What order can I take that will content ye?",
  "9737": "How did you get such broad broad feet?",
  "9738": "And who's this?",
  "9739": "Hawkins, will you ring that bell?",
  "9740": "How could this agree with defects which are peculiar to little minds?",
  "9741": "Why, have you not been naught?",
  "9742": "What brings you here at this hour?",
  "9743": "At what point then is the approach of danger to be expected?",
  "9744": "And that would delay us?",
  "9745": "Only then?",
  "9746": "Struck dead at first, what needs a second striking?",
  "9747": "Shall I be believed when I say that, at the depth of thirty feet, I could see as if I was in broad daylight?",
  "9748": "Understand?",
  "9749": "Davy, my darling, are you listening?",
  "9750": "Was her point of view the only possible one with regard to this marriage?",
  "9751": "But how do you mean to pass your time till I come back?",
  "9752": "Four times five will do handsomely, will it?",
  "9753": "You're sure of what you tell me?",
  "9754": "Tell me, are they in your pocket?",
  "9755": "Is it your father?",
  "9756": "Who knows when we may meet again, else?",
  "9757": "Do you remember how, this morning, when you told me of this event, I asked you if there were anything particular you wished me to do?",
  "9758": "Was it like this when you were married?",
  "9759": "Sharp of sight?",
  "9760": "Why do you plague me about souls?",
  "9761": "Have I the giving of them?",
  "9762": "What, monseigneur?",
  "9763": "If you should be taken?",
  "9764": "The coasts?",
  "9765": "Where shall we look?",
  "9766": "And what is the name of this serpent of which you speak?",
  "9767": "Tyeglev?",
  "9768": "Law?",
  "9769": "What's the matter, my dear?",
  "9770": "Well, you've not been dull?",
  "9771": "Why, then, should there be anger between us?",
  "9772": "Do you mean because you're going?",
  "9773": "Why was I wandering alone in this city of the dead?",
  "9774": "But not with young gentlemen?",
  "9775": "Have you no particular commands to leave with me, my father?",
  "9776": "What wages are due to you?",
  "9777": "What the unmentionable to ears polite, do you think I want with rouge?",
  "9778": "What will they be?",
  "9779": "What would you do, my dear?",
  "9780": "Have I, sir, comprehended your instructions?",
  "9781": "What do you mean by that statement?",
  "9782": "Which way shall I come, ma'am?",
  "9783": "What signifies that word, suspected?",
  "9784": "Did you ever see such a rookery?",
  "9785": "How came this creature alive?",
  "9786": "Have I not said enough to show the men and their methods?",
  "9787": "What shall we drink?",
  "9788": "Why should he work?",
  "9789": "How will you sell this rapier, friend?",
  "9790": "And she did not work?",
  "9791": "Is it possible that he has had a hand in the affair?",
  "9792": "Then I must wait?",
  "9793": "Have you developed a new theory about how this fellow escaped out of the ring round him?",
  "9794": "What was your deputy called?",
  "9795": "Please can I go?",
  "9796": "What else could I do if you trusted me?",
  "9797": "Why do they spoil things?",
  "9798": "How about that hour of darkness in which the power of evil is exalted?",
  "9799": "Or shall we content ourselves with a smaller number?",
  "9800": "Who has paid me this attention?",
  "9801": "What's to hurt us?",
  "9802": "You see that car?",
  "9803": "But, as by this theory innumerable transitional forms must have existed, why do we not find them embedded in countless numbers in the crust of the earth?",
  "9804": "Thus, separated from nature by monopoly, cut off from humanity by poverty, the mother of crime and its punishment, what refuge remains for the plebeian whom labor cannot support, and who is not strong enough to take?",
  "9805": "What did the signal mean?",
  "9806": "And what does the sergeant say about this business?",
  "9807": "Must I write it?",
  "9808": "You have no changing fashions?",
  "9809": "Who do you mean, my dear?",
  "9810": "Do we prize this precious privilege as we ought?",
  "9811": "I shall find him there?",
  "9812": "But was flight still possible?",
  "9813": "HOWARDS END?",
  "9814": "Become of me?",
  "9815": "What cart is this?",
  "9816": "How long have you allowed us to waste ourselves upon a search that you knew to be an absurd one?",
  "9817": "And the nature of the work?",
  "9818": "You contemplate remaining idle?",
  "9819": "You do not think, however, of setting out immediately?",
  "9820": "But my father's very much vexed, I dare say?",
  "9821": "Why did not the writer relieve me by giving the information I most needed?",
  "9822": "By the oath you have taken, tell me truly what time of the year do you do it least in?",
  "9823": "His trunks?",
  "9824": "Do you use to pay ransoms to religious men?",
  "9825": "But what has she done?",
  "9826": "Do you not, by chance, mean to touch the teal?",
  "9827": "And you drank it in, eh?",
  "9828": "Where's the pony gone?",
  "9829": "Vot is it?",
  "9830": "What, then, is progress?",
  "9831": "No name signed?",
  "9832": "How do you like my funny house?",
  "9833": "Now prince, consider, why did he leave his address?",
  "9834": "Was it not almost universal?",
  "9835": "What business has an old bachelor like that to marry?",
  "9836": "And you attribute this colour to the presence of a microscopic seaweed?",
  "9837": "What are the two fish?",
  "9838": "Be I going, doctor?",
  "9839": "Tell me now, were you a yeoman and made a knight by force?",
  "9840": "What was the number?",
  "9841": "Then what do you fear, my lord?",
  "9842": "Your engagement at the other place is ended?",
  "9843": "And what do you intend to make of him, ma'am?",
  "9844": "In what manner were you carried off?",
  "9845": "WHY did you despise me?",
  "9846": "Catched un, my dear?",
  "9847": "Was your father an artist?",
  "9848": "Official?",
  "9849": "What else had been there?",
  "9850": "Then what has he been passing himself off as an unmarried man for?",
  "9851": "When shall we arrive there?",
  "9852": "You mean marriage?",
  "9853": "Do you know of one who is being misrepresented?",
  "9854": "But where is such a lackey to be found?",
  "9855": "Dundee, I suppose?",
  "9856": "Well, would it suit you to trim hogs?",
  "9857": "Will not you recall to mind the prodigious things done for your forefathers and this holy place, and how great enemies of yours were by him subdued under you?",
  "9858": "And you worked for her?",
  "9859": "Is all the rest of this batch?",
  "9860": "Why that question, my dear host?",
  "9861": "And wherein was mine honour toucht in that?",
  "9862": "I'd like to know now which is the madder, he who is so because he cannot help it, or he who is so of his own choice?",
  "9863": "Were you at all shocked by what I said?",
  "9864": "Were they alone?",
  "9865": "Is he gone too?",
  "9866": "What makes you keep saying such things?",
  "9867": "If they were to marry, what would they do?",
  "9868": "But what is that to me?",
  "9869": "Did you recognize him?",
  "9870": "DO you?",
  "9871": "I claim by the right of inheritance and possession, and who shall dare to extort you from my hands?",
  "9872": "Was the joy all for the boys?",
  "9873": "Have you a complaint to make?",
  "9874": "What is a machine, in fact?",
  "9875": "Was there not something vulgar in letters, something inconsistent with the easy apathetic graces of a man of the mode?",
  "9876": "So we can reckon upon you, count, for the coming elections?",
  "9877": "What was the fellow's name who was keeping you company and causing you to add cruelty to her to your wrong to me?",
  "9878": "Who is coming?",
  "9879": "The forest?",
  "9880": "How did those children come there?",
  "9881": "Do you know what I heard today?",

  "12595": "You have not found him?",
  "12596": "For long?",
  "12597": "Would it make my happy that you should be a prisoner here for ever?",
  "12598": "Have you had no accident?",
  "12599": "Who's the best shot?",
  "12600": "Why, dear child, what has made your poor little heart so sad?",
  "12601": "You mean she'll make it out her own fault?",
  "12602": "He who had in former days known all the roads to triumph, and who, from the summit of his chariot of lightning, pointed them out with a sovereign finger, had he now reached that state of sinister amazement when he could lead his tumultuous legions harnessed to it, to the precipice?",
  "12603": "Has he got wind of some host approaching, and does he wish to warn us, or would he speak upon some other matter of public moment?",
  "12604": "Why threepence?",
  "12605": "But do you care about them?",
  "12606": "I now know you are all right, and what can I wish for more?",
  "12607": "But if this indemnity is refused me, what do I, a proletaire, care for the tranquillity and security of the rich?",
  "12608": "Why may not our country at some time average as many?",
  "12609": "Does it hurt?",
  "12610": "And what, after all, is the security which this training gives to governments?",
  "12611": "Now what are you going to do?",
  "12612": "Do you know it?",
  "12613": "Now was she to begin?",
  "12614": "And understand them?",
  "12615": "What could her heart want more, better, more beautiful, more rich than such a love as this?",
  "12616": "Now how did this odious stigma originate?",
  "12617": "And who will weigh it for you?",
  "12618": "Does any one know?",
  "12619": "How could I be that?",
  "12620": "You know my studio at the top of the house?",
  "12621": "How far might you call yourselves from the marshes, hereabouts?",
  "12622": "He being the heir?",
  "12623": "Thomas, you have returned, then, and your first act is again an indiscretion and a piece of foolhardy rashness?",
  "12624": "What caused it?",
  "12625": "How then could I unite with this wild idolator in worshipping his piece of wood?",
  "12626": "Have not some of the intriguers put it into his head that I regard him with jealousy?",
  "12627": "In his glance?",
  "12628": "Who will go and cut wood in the forest?",
  "12629": "What, has he purchased arms, then?",
  "12630": "Now, what is the value of this product?",
  "12631": "Will you?",
  "12632": "Because we are bidden to feast with them, because we are bidden to rejoice with them, because we are bidden to play the lute with them, because we are bidden to dance with them?",
  "12633": "Yes, well?",
  "12634": "And why did you refuse, my son?",
  "12635": "Is that what they think of relationships nowadays?",
  "12636": "Why did I do that?",
  "12637": "Then you have some other motive unknown to us?",
  "12638": "Old?",
  "12639": "Then you would infer that opinion is intermediate?",
  "12640": "What other course was left to take?",
  "12641": "If the dream is not the same as the things dreamed, in what other form does it appear to you?",
  "12642": "Do you not know it?",
  "12643": "But have you not received my notes?",
  "12644": "Are the preparations for the games complete?",
  "12645": "Where do you wish me to go, madame?",
  "12646": "And who may this be?",
  "12647": "What if she's marrying me simply to be married?",
  "12648": "What about them?",
  "12649": "Would you like to know the opinion of a chronicler of the fourteenth century?",
  "12650": "Well, is he?",
  "12651": "What shall we do?",
  "12652": "Should he abandon his friends who were expecting him?",
  "12653": "Clever?",
  "12654": "And when's the wedding to be?",
  "12655": "What is all that about?",
  "12656": "When we had walked about a mile by moonlight, we perceived a horseman behind us, who coming up, wished us good even, and asked which way we went?",
  "12657": "Now, then, what did you do to your hair?",
  "12658": "Why do you pish, captain?",
  "12659": "And what would be the use of behaving otherwise?",
  "12660": "Cousin, will you any tobacco?",
  "12661": "Why not think much about this mansion?",
  "12662": "Is it his child?",
  "12663": "How do you say it?",
  "12664": "Who's been telling you that?",
  "12665": "How like you this?",
  "12666": "Have you got a pistol?",
  "12667": "Then the cowardly and mean nature has no part in true philosophy?",
  "12668": "That you believe there's nothing I'm afraid of?",
  "12669": "Now are you content?",
  "12670": "What is there in heaven or on earth which it does not embrace, and with so much facility, with so much gracefulness, as if there were scarcely an effort in it, or as if self was charmed away, and might not mingle to distract it?",
  "12671": "Is it really only negative?",
  "12672": "HIS father?",
  "12673": "Of what sort could a woman be who wrote such a letter as that?",
  "12674": "And why should I?",
  "12675": "And is it just to assail, condemn, or despise them for doing so?",
  "12676": "Could her mother own it if she did?",
  "12677": "Now, can you?",
  "12678": "Well, what is there so astonishing in that?",
  "12679": "What, will he deal upon such quantities of wine, alone?",
  "12680": "Why, it may be asked, have all the most eminent living naturalists and geologists rejected this view of the mutability of species?",

  "12683": "Should I find down there a whole colony of exiles who, weary of the miseries of this earth, had sought and found independence in the deep ocean?",
  "12684": "I presume we are going to pass the night here?",
  "12685": "Do you know that seventeen bottles of rye whiskey were sent out from the town this afternoon to that innocent and unsuspecting school house?",
  "12686": "Is it death?",
  "12687": "Why, indeed, am I still here?",
  "12688": "Did you go in?",
  "12689": "From what part of the world did it rise?",
  "12690": "Do you wish to see him?",
  "12691": "Is not your father living?",
  "12692": "Well, you do not reply?",
  "12693": "One day, perhaps?",
  "12694": "Is he not peculiar?",
  "12695": "What are you crying about?",
  "12696": "Has he frightened him?",
  "12697": "By whose authority do you act?",
  "12698": "He is rich, is he not?",
  "12699": "And what did mother say?",
  "12700": "Trevanion?",
  "12701": "What is the use of bringing her into the discussion?",
  "12702": "What is she?",
  "12703": "It's what you brought me out for?",
  "12704": "Where be now these oaths?",
  "12705": "I am then to consider the commission withdrawn?",
  "12706": "And what more?",
  "12707": "Is that your school satchel?",
  "12708": "Is this your crown?",
  "12709": "Was this a hint?",
  "12710": "What did you watch me for?",
  "12711": "What little bird of scarlet plumage may this be?",
  "12712": "How long has she been gone?",
  "12713": "And must we not exercise a broad faith in the value of enlightenment, increase of knowledge, farsightedness, the cultivation of complex emotions, even at the risk of some waste of effort and some suffering to certain individuals?",
  "12714": "Her appeal to his honour?",
  "12715": "I mean, has SHE given her formal consent?",
  "12716": "And when she finally returned, did she bring that casket with her?",
  "12717": "Who could have taken it?",
  "12718": "Why need we pay it?",
  "12719": "D'you know what that means?",
  "12720": "Well, how does our friend look at it?",
  "12721": "Yet who will deny that the imagination and understanding have made many, very many discoveries since those days, which only seem harbingers of others still more noble and beneficial?",
  "12722": "Was there not an elder brother?",
  "12723": "For everybody?",
  "12724": "Which?",
  "12725": "What did you do?",
  "12726": "Manage a place?",
  "12727": "How long have you been in bed?",
  "12728": "You leave off?",
  "12729": "Who, then, urged you to write?",
  "12730": "Suppose it should break in turning out?",
  "12731": "And who are the devoted band, and where will he procure them?",
  "12732": "And was this lady young and handsome?",
  "12733": "Where shall I ever find a friend, when these three are my enemies, belonging to me, yet putting me to death?",
  "12734": "Besides, what is danger in comparison with the right?",
  "12735": "How is it, then, I repeat, that a wholly external accident has changed the nature of man, which is supposed to be good and gentle and social?",
  "12736": "Surely not, and why is it that they are not willing, as they formerly were willing, to sacrifice the interests of their country to the interests of their religious persuasion?",
  "12737": "Then when am I to have it?",
  "12738": "I may sacrifice my soul, but what matters it?",
  "12739": "And that young girl?",
  "12740": "To her?",
  "12741": "What care I?",
  "12742": "What purpose do such habits serve?",
  "12743": "Was she in a shop?",
  "12744": "How had he so quickly turned aversion into, at any rate, acquaintance?",
  "12745": "Do you like it better?",
  "12746": "Are you traders?",
  "12747": "Who's him?",
  "12748": "How can she do so?",
  "12749": "What is my ruling faculty now to me?",
  "12750": "But have we time?",
  "12751": "And what was his name?",
  "12752": "But why shall I minutely detail the unspeakable horrors of that night?",

  "12759": "Are my things all right?",
  "12760": "But who?",
  "12761": "And what did he tell you?",
  "12762": "You are not afraid of wolves, my boy?",
  "12763": "If I go among gentlemen, can I talk to them?",
  "12764": "Suppose I happen to strangle him?",
  "12765": "At the last minute?",
  "12766": "How could I sell it to you?",
  "12767": "Shall the laborer who is capable of finishing his task in six hours have the right, on the ground of superior strength and activity, to usurp the task of the less skilful laborer, and thus rob him of his labor and bread?",
  "12768": "And what is evil?",
  "12769": "For to what end should the sun impart unto her any of his light?",
  "12770": "And you, a trained man of science, believe it to be supernatural?",
  "12771": "Abominable, is it not?",
  "12772": "Who shall first be sung and lauded?",
  "12773": "What did she say then?",
  "12774": "Why is it wrong?",
  "12775": "Would you like to see her?",

  "12777": "Have you ridden very fast?",
  "12778": "Where's the big bob?",
  "12779": "And you found it?",
  "12780": "Something?",
  "12781": "Well, what good wind blows you hither at this hour?",
  "12782": "How do you know that the woman is his wife?",
  "12783": "Would I do this for every man?",
  "12784": "O, have you got your ticket?",
  "12785": "Have you always lived with them?",
  "12786": "What doth your journey mean?",
  "12787": "What words were those that he heard?",
  "12788": "And have I done right in divesting myself of my wealth?",

  "12790": "Winning his affections?",
  "12791": "But what doleful ditty is this for the lips of a stout yeoman?",
  "12792": "You have seen convents?",
  "12793": "But how could it have been done?",
  "12794": "Is he at home?",
  "12795": "Sell this ring, a ring which comes from my sovereign?",
  "12796": "Is not that my right?",
  "12797": "You think he'd get after her?",

  "12804": "Your excellency is the travelling companion of the viscount?",
  "12805": "For what advantage would result to them from this or to the whole, which is the special object of their providence?",
  "12806": "You are not going to the public meeting?",
  "12807": "Marchioness, take a seat on the bed, will you?",
  "12808": "And what person?",
  "12809": "You know what we're speaking of?",
  "12810": "What is the bargain?",
  "12811": "Embassadour, what newes nath vrg'd this sodain entrance?",
  "12812": "Very early?",
  "12813": "Was he conscious of all that passed within him, and of all that was working there?",
  "12814": "Of course you stopped at your father's?",
  "12815": "How do I appear to people?",
  "12816": "Do you see anything to the contrary?",
  "12817": "Could he not turn his having lost all into an opportunity?",
  "12818": "What do you want HER to know how you are for?",
  "12819": "But is it true that I have but a fortnight of life left to me?",
  "12820": "Who ARE you?",
  "12821": "Must I do so?",
  "12822": "Well, then, why do you wish me to give up seeing such a man?",
  "12823": "You are sure he will keep his word with me?",
  "12824": "And is there any man in whom you will find more of this sort of misery than in the tyrannical man, who is in a fury of passions and desires?",
  "12825": "But why destroy my friends?",
  "12826": "What were the swans doing on the grass?",
  "12827": "For your sins?",
  "12828": "And they will take them on the safe expeditions and be cautious about the dangerous ones?",
  "12829": "You want to know what became of those geese?",
  "12830": "Then you are going with me?",
  "12831": "Who do you think that couple is?",
  "12832": "You think, gentlemen, perhaps that I am mad?",
  "12833": "Who is there, in the official world, that conceives the necessity and therefore the possibility of such a reconciliation?",
  "12834": "An arrest?",
  "12835": "Well, what would you do?",
  "12836": "Of who?",
  "12837": "Was volume or intensity the stronger?",
  "12838": "And love me?",
  "12839": "Why am I not free?",
  "12840": "What do you mean by a vacuum?",
  "12841": "And wounded, too?",

  "12851": "How long did they remain thus?",
  "12852": "What, then, must be our representation of space, in order that such a cognition of it may be possible?",
  "12853": "What do these reproaches mean?",
  "12854": "What is the latest you have?",
  "12855": "Can it be that all this has happened so quickly and has destroyed all that went before?",
  "12856": "And how in the world did you find them?",
  "12857": "Doth not the death of your kinsmen and all the hardship grieve the minds of you good knights?",

  "12865": "Did he indeed, now?",
  "12866": "What shall be done?",
  "12867": "Purposely?",
  "12868": "And what then is the name?",
  "12869": "WHAT poor knight?",

  "12875": "Say, how much you got in your pocket?",
  "12876": "Was it not because I loved men far too well?",
  "12877": "And the crew?",
  "12878": "A great deal?",
  "12879": "How can it be night, then?",
  "12880": "Have not the ladies invited you to join them at the piano?",
  "12881": "By persecution or by force?",
  "12882": "What if his marts for business were gone for ever?",
  "12883": "What gratification can I have except the brandy bottle?",
  "12884": "Did these footprints begin at the water's edge?",
  "12885": "What does it matter now?",
  "12886": "And where is your mother?",
  "12887": "Cure the evil?",
  "12888": "And what if you should happen to cough or to sneeze?",
  "12889": "Do you mean she'll ASK it of me?",
  "12890": "What did the prince say just now?",
  "12891": "Shall I read aloud?",
  "12892": "Have they any will?",
  "12893": "Did our talk in the afternoon have something to do with it?",

  "12895": "You would like a glass of lemonade, sir?",
  "12896": "Do you want the tuileries?",
  "12897": "What was their sole remaining chance?",
  "12898": "Well, what does your instinct tell you now?",
  "12899": "Do you think I can wait when business is in question?",
  "12900": "Is your profession really so engaging and interesting as to absorb your whole attention?",
  "12901": "Did she, too, pine for the lost rank, or rather mourn the lost lover?",
  "12902": "Perhaps you are his spirit come to revisit your old home?",
  "12903": "Is the young lady not with her aunt, after all?",
  "12904": "Why had these men come back after having returned to the camp?",
  "12905": "Has he come?",
  "12906": "But how does my sweet girl?",
  "12907": "Do you know what passed when I took him aside?",
  "12908": "Ah, how do you do, my dear prince?",
  "12909": "Of what do you complain?",
  "12910": "What if there WAS some one concealed in the house?",
  "12911": "You are her grandfather, that is?",
  "12912": "And in what way do you think you could be of use to me?",
  "12913": "Laziness?",
  "12914": "Was it I who wanted to take the road to the right on top of the hill, insisting that I recognized the road?",
  "12915": "If so, if she had been wrong to accede to that offer when made, would she not be doubly wrong to hold him to it now that she saw his error?",
  "12916": "Then you will come and dine with me?",
  "12917": "How was it you so suddenly popped up in front of me as you did?",
  "12918": "Why do you insult me by telling me all this?",
  "12919": "What woman?",
  "12920": "And do you think, my excellent friend, that a musician when he adjusts the lyre would desire or claim to exceed or go beyond a musician in the tightening and loosening the strings?",
  "12921": "Why does not he run?",
  "12922": "What could have passed between the two, what ailed the man?",
  "12923": "And CONTIN?",
  "12924": "All well?",
  "12925": "A fine fellow, is he not?",
  "12926": "How would he feel when he met her again, in her poor ruined home?",
  "12927": "Well, now, gentlemen, is not that very alarming?",
  "12928": "What then became of me?",
  "12929": "How no rent?",
  "12930": "You sleep in this room, then?",
  "12931": "Where did you hide it?",
  "12932": "And have women, who have early imbibed notions of passive obedience, sufficient character to manage a family or educate children?",
  "12933": "Do you know her name?",
  "12934": "But suppose we HAD gone through the ceremony?",
  "12935": "Are you, indeed, going there?",
  "12936": "Well, is she there?",
  "12937": "Which side ought he to take?",
  "12938": "You were guarding me?",
  "12939": "Can he praestare fidem datam?",
  "12940": "Of monuments?",
  "12941": "Would she not tell you?",
  "12942": "Is it man or beast?",
  "12943": "Do you fly?",
  "12944": "What do you want among us now?",
  "12945": "Shall I respect man when he condemns me?",
  "12946": "Had all this, however, been even completely present to his companion, what other term could she have applied to the strongest and simplest of her ideas but the one that exactly fitted it?",
  "12947": "Or what?",
  "12948": "What is your badge?",
  "12949": "And when the body is hungry, against eating?",
  "12950": "Is anything in me changed at all?",
  "12951": "What call?",
  "12952": "Upon what, sire?",
  "12953": "And now what are you going to do about it?",
  "12954": "But when do you expect to go?",
  "12955": "Are you in pain?",
  "12956": "Can you not tell when a warning is for your own good?",
  "12957": "And who can have done it but I?",
  "12958": "Well, sir, is not a substitute clothed with all the power and dignity of him who grants the commission?",
  "12959": "Are we not, sir?",
  "12960": "How should the individual choose his satisfactions?",
  "12961": "And who has filled your head with all this nonsense?",
  "12962": "This looks well, eh?",
  "12963": "Was not an early death his certain fate?",
  "12964": "And how did you manage to make them so grand, exalted, and brave with your wonderful verse?",
  "12965": "You wish to know what I will do?",
  "12966": "Tell me, at least, who you are?",
  "12967": "What shall be our excuse with the king?",
  "12968": "But is this really so?",
  "12969": "For how much?",
  "12970": "Is not that quite enough?",
  "12971": "Say he need not lose his children and his wife, will he love you for that more than one who knows he well deserved the loss?",
  "12972": "Or had it transformed itself into this man, and what did the whole thing mean?",
  "12973": "Do you know anything of the commissionnaire?",
  "12974": "And do you impute it to either of those?",
  "12975": "Is she not perhaps still a married woman with a living husband?",
  "12976": "Is there never another to be found in the world?",

  "14021": "Have men, collectively, no whims, no prejudices?",
  "14022": "What did you pay for that meat?",
  "14023": "Or was it sensible?",
  "14024": "Well, what can I do for you this morning?",
  "14025": "You have money for them, for those loafers?",
  "14026": "Among those which grow lean which is that which grows leanest?",
  "14027": "Who's that grunting?",
  "14028": "What could we care about in the whole world beside, if we belonged to each other?",
  "14029": "To be in love is folly?",
  "14030": "Discarding punctilio and maxims adapted to more manageable times, and looking only to the unprecedentedly stern facts of our case, can you do better in any possible event?",
  "14031": "Had she not given all that she possessed?",
  "14032": "Shall we answer?",
  "14033": "Whose seats the weary traveller repose?",
  "14034": "It is really sold, then?",
  "14035": "What was the last word?",

  "14042": "You like that style?",
  "14043": "D'you believe me?",
  "14044": "It was a troubled dream?",
  "14045": "Pain?",
  "14046": "Why do you want to know all this?",
  "14047": "Did I say we could depend upon no better man?",

  "19648": "How will she manage to please him when they are married?",
  "19649": "What do you take me for?",
  "19650": "Why should I leave you?",
  "19651": "What then was it?",
  "19652": "Well, my children, what do you think of the wine?",
  "19653": "Can you bear pain?",
  "19654": "But the question is, what do you say of it?",

  "19667": "What, will nobody move?",
  "19668": "What did you give?",
  "19669": "How can they think so?",
  "19670": "Have I a man out of his senses to deal with?",

  "19691": "Do you not recognize me?",
  "19692": "What have you to put in the place of your proprietary routine, outside of which you see and understand nothing?",
  "19693": "You are going?",
  "19694": "Is this to be exclusive, or are those courts to possess a concurrent jurisdiction?",
  "19695": "What did you consider unbecoming?",
  "19696": "Yet wherefore doubtful?",
  "19697": "What would you like?",
  "19698": "How, then, with the principle of authority so dear to democrats, shall the aspiration of political economy, an aspiration which is also that of the people, be realized?",

  "19741": "Could there be plainer speech than this?",
  "19742": "Where, dearest?",
  "19743": "Good sport, gentlemen?",
  "19744": "What sort of work?",
  "19745": "Now, what'll you bet?",
  "19746": "You fool, why do you catch at a straw?",
  "19747": "Was it not a new record in the annals of science?",
  "19748": "There you are, my partner, eh?",

  "19753": "You knew him in your world?",
  "19754": "Well, and what is your business?",
  "19755": "Is he tame?",
  "19756": "How would it come?",
  "19757": "What's the use of talking about that?",
  "19758": "But, when stating these excellent arguments, did you ask yourself, sir, whither would tend such a transformation of our system of mortgages?",
  "19759": "But if I hate him?",
  "19760": "Those are all?",
  "19761": "Will you come up and see us while we're there?",
  "19762": "What have I done to deserve this?",
  "19763": "Go where?",
  "19764": "How much would you ask if you were me?",
  "19765": "You say that it was I?",
  "19766": "Who are all these with you?",
  "19767": "I think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?",
  "19768": "What do you reckon it is?",
  "19769": "When was this done?",
  "19770": "I hope that I have made myself clear?",

  "19782": "I suppose you've got talipes equinus?",
  "19783": "Where is the blood to come from?",
  "19784": "Did I think that because I was a baronet I could do what I liked?",
  "19785": "And where did you hear it?",
  "19786": "Had we been placed in their circumstances should we have been any better than they?",
  "19787": "I know he'll say something, and then what shall I do?",
  "19788": "Does the machinery stagger?",
  "19789": "But shall we say upon that account, that the wine is harmonious, or the music of a good flavour?",
  "19790": "The custom which is already established, or the laws which are proposed in that treatise?",
  "19791": "Did you get it from an unquestionable source?",
  "19792": "It's not going to be a ghost story?",
  "19793": "What had she to offer her beloved further than a life of retirement, of love, and of quiet happiness?",
  "19794": "A victory?",
  "19795": "It was understood that you wanted nothing for yourself, remember?",
  "19796": "What does that matter?",
  "19797": "Who can this knight be, with the fair damsel by his side?",
  "19798": "You mean that they were very clever and learned men, while you have grave doubts whether I am either?",
  "19799": "Was it ever known who this miserable fellow was?",
  "19800": "And your servants?",
  "19801": "So he is in prison then?",
  "19802": "Must my house or my roof be polluted with the scent of bears and bulls, when it is perfumed for great ladies?",
  "19803": "Well, and how did it end?",
  "19804": "And you reject this mark of my friendship?",
  "19805": "Then why, instead of tacking so frequently, do you not sail nearer the wind?",
  "19806": "What are you thumping the table for?",
  "19807": "Well, supposing I do love him?",
  "19808": "Quid feci?",
  "19809": "Does your majesty consent?",
  "19810": "How could I give her up, perhaps to stand her trial for murder?",
  "19811": "But what did my independence avail me, when I had bound myself in new fetters?",
  "19812": "What were these affrighted, shrieking voices calling?",
  "19813": "Did you ever see a man there who is accustomed to walk about with a ruler in his hand?",
  "19814": "Once more, then, what stops you?",
  "19815": "Was I a fool?",
  "19816": "How does he for the bells?",
  "19817": "Why is it that when you awake to the world of realities you nearly always feel, sometimes very vividly, that the vanished dream has carried with it some enigma which you have failed to solve?",
  "19818": "What is stronger?",
  "19819": "After all, what is there for us to fear in this house?",
  "19820": "But did it ever speak thus?",
  "19821": "How much is that?",
  "19822": "But what was this portion of the globe which had been swallowed by cataclysms?",
  "19823": "What shall I do to him?",
  "19824": "Will you be as frank?",
  "19825": "What shall we say to her?",
  "19826": "Where will you meet?",
  "19827": "Today, almost for the first time, I set to work seriously, and what happened?",
  "19828": "Who could hope ever to do anything to the satisfaction of the press?",
  "19829": "What's the matter naow?",
  "19830": "Now, about the honest hands?",
  "19831": "Would you like to be a gull?",
  "19832": "Why did they want out?",
  "19833": "What are the uses of decisions of courts?",
  "19834": "Oh, that was it?",
  "19835": "How can I be bribed?",
  "19836": "To him or to me?",
  "19837": "Why did you not dissuade him from it?",
  "19838": "Have you anything more to say?",
  "19839": "Any trade?",
  "19840": "What should I do with beans?",
  "19841": "I shall see you again, then, my lord?",
  "19842": "What then shall be done?",
  "19843": "What regulates them?",
  "19844": "Quite sure you can stand it?",
  "19845": "Tell us, shall we tell her now?",
  "19846": "What am I to call you?",
  "19847": "What do you mean by a struggle?",
  "19848": "How do you do?",
  "19849": "Where'd you get him ?",
  "19850": "Do you wish to take it, and what price will you pay if I let you have the whole of it?",
  "19851": "Any mail?",
  "19852": "D'you ever try it?",
  "19853": "You're playing secretaire?",
  "19854": "And was it really possible and true, that her last darling was to be torn from her?",
  "19855": "What did he care that his aunts were only two ignorant old women?",
  "19856": "Are you not going in, sir?",
  "19857": "Ah, what is that?",
  "19858": "Can you not trust me as a physician when I tell you so?",
  "19859": "Then what, exactly, is your plan for us?",
  "19860": "How did you do that?",
  "19861": "If so, what news?",
  "19862": "Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as his father did before him?",
  "19863": "But when and where had I seen them?",
  "19864": "Did any see it after?",
  "19865": "Lithia?",
  "19866": "Why should not the same sort of thing happen to me?",
  "19867": "Do you think so, really?",
  "19868": "And you would say the same sort of thing of the physician?",
  "19869": "But was it cast after all?",
  "19870": "Both lost?",
  "19871": "Is he so haughty?",
  "19872": "How then can I know, my dear?",
  "19873": "Will not?",
  "19874": "Can you still lie?",
  "19875": "You wished me to know the reasons?",
  "19876": "Or else, why did she not go out of the neighborhood, and get a situation where she was not known?",
  "19877": "Do you know that he holds terrestrial beings under his control?",
  "19878": "Has she been with you long?",
  "19879": "Or shall we say that they are in harmony with the apparent social will only, and really stand condemned?",
  "19880": "An explanation?",
  "19881": "What shall I be next?",
  "19882": "Where's the larder?",
  "19883": "Suppose a boy sauced you back when you told him to do something?",
  "19884": "Putting ourselves out of the question, what would you think of a girl who could engage herself to any man under such circumstances?",
  "19885": "As at present?",
  "19886": "Whom have I hurt?",
  "19887": "Do you mean if you give in?",
  "19888": "Or have tasted the bag of the bee?",
  "19889": "For rich caparisons or trapping gay?",
  "19890": "Would you have it?",
  "19891": "What hotel did you manage?",
  "19892": "Where falls the balance of freedoms here?",
  "19893": "What sauce are they most dainty for?",
  "19894": "Is there not love in my heart, and constancy in my resolves?",
  "19895": "Were not the odds the other way?",
  "19896": "Did he keep any record of his cases?",
  "19897": "How often have I asked you not to take my things?",
  "19898": "Rank?",
  "19899": "How did it begin, when did it all come about?",
  "19900": "Well, what is to be done?",
  "19901": "Can you hear a mewing cat?",
  "19902": "Have you any opinion to offer, count?",
  "19903": "How long must we stay, do you think?",
  "19904": "What, gossip?",
  "19905": "What is the matter with it?",
  "19906": "But may I be allowed to place the mark for the second shooting?",
  "19907": "Have you ever noticed that all little children are blond?",
  "19908": "And that cavalier, that guest, that nobleman who arrived before she came?",
  "19909": "When am I to wear it?",
  "19910": "How do you communicate?",
  "19911": "Have you enemies, then?",
  "19912": "Which of them will you test?",
  "19913": "Would you really do that?",
  "19914": "How is your old fellow?",
  "19915": "What bottles?",
  "19916": "Could we not keep it as a secret?",
  "19917": "But proportional to what?",
  "19918": "What would these insects eat, if we did not pass this way?",
  "19919": "Your advice, then?",
  "19920": "From the monastery?",
  "19921": "Are you not meditating?",
  "19922": "Would you compel such a state of affairs?",
  "19923": "Then how do you know?",
  "19924": "Supposing nobody should ever fetch me, how long would they consent to keep me there?",
  "19925": "And I?",
  "19926": "Are you alone, madam?",
  "19927": "Vulgar?",
  "19928": "Is not this change wrought in your minds a very important change?",
  "19929": "Shall I run on and stop them?",
  "19930": "What sort of road would that be?",
  "19931": "Is it your intention to go to an hotel, sir?",
  "19932": "Shall we go this high very long?",
  "19933": "Up?",
  "19934": "Was it this room?",
  "19935": "Anyone shot a fox?",
  "19936": "Then what business is it of yours?",
  "19937": "Dishonorable?",
  "19938": "What is the steamer's name?",
  "19939": "Do you often go to see it?",
  "19940": "How is it that the convicts are lying yonder dead, in the middle of the enclosure?",
  "19941": "But where should she go?",
  "19942": "You would be afraid to draw such an inference, would you not?",
  "19943": "Why, instead of a revolution, did they not content themselves with a reform?",
  "19944": "Why should you say that?",
  "19945": "And had it ready a nice little pinch of salt to put upon his tail?",
  "19946": "In what direction?",
  "19947": "And why was this?",
  "19948": "Now, did it strike your ladyship that she was like anybody?",
  "19949": "What do you mean to do with him?",
  "19950": "Not caring for their lives, is it?",
  "19951": "Will you promise to sit up with me to bear me company?",
  "19952": "What are you waiting for?",
  "19953": "What bell was that?",
  "19954": "And with you, governor?",
  "19955": "How came the words forth from her?",
  "19956": "Have I not always fought for your glory and interests?",
  "19957": "What, after all, was this blood of which she had taught herself to think so much?",
  "19958": "How do you do?",
  "19959": "But could it be otherwise?",
  "19960": "Must I compel men to render her fitting honor?",
  "19961": "For who gets wealth, that puts not from the shore?",
  "19962": "You feel, in other words, that she lies to you?",
  "19963": "Who has?",
  "19964": "And what crime has he committed?",
  "19965": "And whom are you waiting for?",
  "19966": "Why not say so?",
  "19967": "Nine, ten, eleven?",
  "19968": "And it was a fierce one?",
  "19969": "What have you been doing all this time, eh?",
  "19970": "Well, what does that lead up to?",
  "19971": "To whom did he call?",
  "19972": "Could he be dead?",
  "19973": "What else can we do?",
  "19974": "Had he fallen during the attack on his rider, or was he straying in the bush, or had the convicts carried him off?",
  "19975": "How can he tell?",
  "19976": "Is it with me or for me that you are angry?",
  "19977": "Then how is it that I seem to understand them myself?",
  "19978": "Where dwell we now?",
  "19979": "Why are they always anxious?",
  "19980": "What man has authority over himself?",
  "19981": "Who attends to them?",
  "19982": "And now, monseigneur, your answer to this proposition?",
  "19983": "And that caused his sister to refuse my brother?",
  "19984": "And you think she would be angry?",
  "19985": "What news have you?",
  "19986": "And have you not seen any of our other friends?",
  "19987": "All I'd done?",
  "19988": "If there are other causes of poverty than competition, does that prevent it from contributing its share?",
  "19989": "Faithful to whom?",
  "19990": "Ah, but if you got nothing to eat for ever so long?",
  "19991": "A horror?",
  "19992": "Do you think I was sorry?",
  "19993": "What's the matter?",
  "19994": "I suppose you will live with her now?",
  "19995": "Of what consequence is it to me, then, whether he be grateful or not?",
  "19996": "What villainy is this?",
  "19997": "Blewett?",
  "19998": "At home?",
  "19999": "Why, instead of transports that should have intoxicated me with their deliciousness, did I experience only fears and repugnance?",
  "20000": "Whats he?",
  "20001": "Well, he took that icon home with him for a few days and what did he do?",
  "20002": "Why, we must ask, do you trouble yourself so much about death?",
  "20003": "The greatest affection of which he is capable?",
  "20004": "Wife?",
  "20005": "A pox, is this your inns o' court breeding, not to know your friends and your relations, your elders, and your betters?",
  "20006": "And what's her name?",
  "20007": "What are those we know?",
  "20008": "Now do you want me to tell you who you are?",
  "20009": "Are you dissatisfied with my service, say?",
  "20010": "What is the object of slaying the spirit of vegetation at any time and above all in spring, when his services are most wanted?",
  "20011": "What is there in your son's face?",
  "20012": "Gone where?",
  "20013": "What length of course do you propose, dear heart?",
  "20014": "In what manner was I protected by him?",
  "20015": "What do you like best?",
  "20016": "Is it customary, I ask you, to help to tenderloin with one's fingers?",
  "20017": "Do you imagine that a person can die like this?",
  "20018": "Have you received the orders, and will you act upon them?",
  "20019": "How are they called who follow others in spite of them?",
  "20020": "Do you mean that you saw the murder?",
  "20021": "Was it not then a man like you and me, who first proposed this law, and by speaking persuaded the ancients?",
  "20022": "A political one, I suppose?",
  "20023": "What, I ask, in that case, would have been your conduct towards her?",
  "20024": "And suppose he falls?",
  "20025": "An expedition, sir?",
  "20026": "Is it not enough to set him thinking about it?",
  "20027": "What am I?",
  "20028": "Do you believe they're his own?",
  "20029": "And if I obtain this son, the object of my most cherished wishes, this son who is so necessary to me, who will take my place with him when I shall be absent?",
  "20030": "But you're not making a mistake?",
  "20031": "Was you a party in anything, ma'am?",
  "20032": "The knight they went to?",
  "20033": "Ask him what?",
  "20034": "Have I done something for the general interest?",
  "20035": "Have they legs and chops?",
  "20036": "What do you mean by this conduct?",
  "20037": "With him, aunt?",

  "22134": "Is there any chance of his being made to speak?",
  "22135": "Would his father meet him at the station?",
  "22136": "But what do you mean by strange?",
  "22137": "Why, what are you thinking about?",

  "22141": "Are there not others for that discipline?",
  "22142": "What is your trouble?",
  "22143": "How do you live then?",
  "22144": "Why should I live now that I have known a perfect love?",
  "22145": "Whose is it?",
  "22146": "And his age?",
  "22147": "Why, pray, do you talk nonsense, as if you had fallen from an ass?",
  "22148": "But why do you take such an interest in me?",
  "22149": "Why has he constantly called them a series of measures?",
  "22150": "What causes?",
  "22151": "What will be the result of your conduct?",
  "22152": "On account of the great geographical discoveries, the important scientific results?",
  "22153": "Is not that always so?",
  "22154": "Can you take that in?",
  "22155": "Did I understand you?",
  "22156": "Well, is it over?",
  "22157": "And what would he have done had he overtaken us?",
  "22158": "Do you know that for a fact?",
  "22159": "What need you go, sir, if I tell you?",
  "22160": "Or that he who errs in arithmetic or grammar is an arithmetician or grammarian at the me when he is making the mistake, in respect of the mistake?",
  "22161": "What was the use of thinking about behavior after this crying?",
  "22162": "Did it happen here, ever?",
  "22163": "Or rather, is not the nearest approach to the knowledge of their several natures made by him who so orders his intellectual vision as to have the most exact conception of the essence of each thing which he considers?",
  "22164": "Can the dead come to life?",
  "22165": "But cannot you have pity on me?",
  "22166": "Who will give me seven cents more?",
  "22167": "Is this true?",
  "22168": "In what way different?",
  "22169": "What I mean is, what about the next step?",
  "22170": "Do you remember it so well?",
  "22171": "Would you ring the bell, please?",

  "22175": "What are you going to do, my lord?",
  "22176": "Are we to do nothing, then?",
  "22177": "Have done, shipmate, will ye?",
  "22178": "Since then no part of our earth is left unoccupied, why is it to be supposed that the immensity of space is a naked void, lying in eternal waste?",
  "22179": "The whole truth?",
  "22180": "What more desirable or more essential than this quality in the governors of nations?",
  "22181": "What is your name, dear?",
  "22182": "Governor, why stand you all so pitiless?",
  "22183": "Suppose we say a little something down, and a fuller discussion of the matter later?",
  "22184": "What call you the lord of the castle, sweet face?",
  "22185": "Is the exchange an equitable one?",
  "22186": "What do they care for but money?",
  "22187": "What is it you stare at?",
  "22188": "But you have promised not to go until she comes?",
  "22189": "But what is a cable's length?",
  "22190": "And we'll be in a friendly country?",
  "22191": "What in the world does that mean?",
  "22192": "D'you mean to say they're worth nothing at all?",
  "22193": "What is the use of counting on any success of mine?",
  "22194": "But who were the victors?",
  "22195": "When are you coming out?",
  "22196": "Can you be with us?",
  "22197": "So he is a very good father, is he?",
  "22198": "What do you recognize?",
  "22199": "Did not one grain of pity enter your heart as she turned away?",
  "22200": "You're not going with her?",
  "22201": "What appointment?",
  "22202": "Who's brought it?",
  "22203": "What DID you do, you naughty, bad thing?",
  "22204": "What do you think of those fellows yonder?",
  "22205": "I suppose you have some cause of quarrel?",

  "22207": "Shall I give you a lift?",
  "22208": "What's that he's got in his paddle?",
  "22209": "And the wise is good?",
  "22210": "Now what have you to say?",
  "22211": "Who can doubt that the refusal to fight a duel through fear has caused many men an agony of shame?",
  "22212": "Have I gone through all this to fail at the last?",
  "22213": "What, with that face?",
  "22214": "What his teachings?",
  "22215": "Do you think I'm putting you into an impossible position?",

  "22217": "Will you let me go with you?",
  "22218": "How much time have I lost by illness?",
  "22219": "Is it enough merely to love if one cannot put all the poetry and all the music of heaven and earth into love?",
  "22220": "How much have you done?",

  "22230": "What were you about saying, sir?",
  "22231": "But was it possible for him to be brave when he was by himself, face to face with his soul, or would he then surrender to despair?",
  "22232": "Why long for a life which could be for him now only an isolated, desolate, and gloomy one?",
  "22233": "Could we not bail her out?",
  "22234": "How shall we prevent a conflict between charity and judgment?",
  "22235": "What have I all along maintained?",
  "22236": "Disko, what did you pick me up for?",
  "22237": "How will you take it, ungrateful brute?",
  "22238": "Why, then, suppose now an inertia which definitions contradict, now an external potentiality which nothing proves?",
  "22239": "Well, but what ought to be the criterion?",
  "22240": "Then, darling papa?",
  "22241": "Or rather was it a boat from the frigate, that was hailing us in the darkness?",
  "22242": "Is this the language of a rational man?",
  "22243": "Well, and how did the ring come into your possession?",
  "22244": "What should I have done as soon as I was hard and fast here?",
  "22245": "Why had not you as good do it?",
  "22246": "Am I going, or not, to my ruin?",
  "22247": "And who is ever silly enough to complain of it?",
  "22248": "But what sort of a way is that for bones to lie?",
  "22249": "Is it not evident, then, I ask you, that there will some day appear velocities far greater than these, of which light or electricity will probably be the mechanical agent?",
  "22250": "Do you recognize your quondam pupil, professor?",
  "22251": "Can he even see the feature?",
  "22252": "Well, why have I worried him, for five years, and never let him go free?",
  "22253": "Are there then chains for two which are forged on high?",
  "22254": "How could you have gone away and left me?",
  "22255": "How many kingdoms are there at present in the world, and how many more do we find in history, whose governors have no better foundation for their authority than that of present possession?",
  "22256": "Is any better than experience and wisdom and reason?",
  "22257": "But can that which is neither become both?",
  "22258": "But he really is disinterested, and above small jealousy and spite, I have heard?",
  "22259": "And he rests now, near his companions, in the coral cemetery?",
  "22260": "What are we to do, now?",
  "22261": "And now, where is he gone?",
  "22262": "Do you not need to mitigate the struggle for existence more sanguine than the war of weapons?",
  "22263": "When will he come back?",
  "22264": "And why should I not dare?",
  "22265": "And is he in love perchance?",
  "22266": "Surely, this was not the only cause of estrangement?",
  "22267": "Where had he heard the name before?",
  "22268": "Where's my mother?",
  "22269": "Were you looking for us?",
  "22270": "But tell me, and tell me true, what is the meaning of all this feasting, and who are these people?",
  "22271": "Has it begun?",
  "22272": "Where are you taking me?",
  "22273": "What's all this?",
  "22274": "Shall you be present in the reception room?",
  "22275": "What was the matter?",
  "22276": "What magazine, or treasury of bliss?",
  "22277": "What do I think?",
  "22278": "Ah, why DID he?",
  "22279": "How could I ask you to gif up so much for a poor old fellow, who has no fortune but a little learning?",
  "22280": "Is it quite certain?",
  "22281": "Clayton?",
  "22282": "Why do you not think so?",
  "22283": "And you will permit me to accompany you?",
  "22284": "And you can refuse, you mean, eh?",
  "22285": "What, then, was there left to do?",
  "22286": "What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed?",
  "22287": "Are you so sure?",
  "22288": "Is that too simple a source of pleasure for some to prize?",
  "22289": "Then you knew her before?",
  "22290": "Have you not asked papa for money?",
  "22291": "Is there anything whimsical about me?",
  "22292": "Is this ingratitude, however?",
  "22293": "For nothing?",
  "22294": "The winch, you say?",
  "22295": "Was ever a man in such a fearful fool's position?",
  "22296": "But this kind man who has done so much will, I am sure, take you right on to my house?",
  "22297": "But if no one among us is capable of governing himself, then who among us has the capacity to govern someone else?",
  "22298": "Was personal happiness the aim and object of their ambition?",
  "22299": "Have you ever seen a wire jacket?",
  "22300": "Cranmer awaits us in the private chapel?",
  "22301": "And how about today's telegram?",
  "22302": "Where had that daring singer got to?",
  "22303": "Was it he who threw us that bottle, when the vessel made her first cruise?",
  "22304": "Brilliant?",
  "22305": "Now, what is competition?",
  "22306": "Do you know that you are speaking to me quite as a friend?",
  "22307": "What do you do then?",
  "22308": "Do you think we live as cheaply as we might?",
  "22309": "Surely there are classified lists?",
  "22310": "Why ride into the middle of the battalion?",
  "22311": "May I ask if you can confirm these statements?",
  "22312": "Is not this an infallible and sovereign antidote?",
  "22313": "Well, what's this now?",
  "22314": "Now, what have we a right to possess?",
  "22315": "A cigarette?",
  "22316": "What act?",
  "22317": "What in thunder is it?",
  "22318": "And the man?",
  "22319": "How am I to understand you, mon pere?",
  "22320": "Why dilate upon what everybody knows?",
  "22321": "Might this be for you, sir?",
  "22322": "How can you learn lessons in here?",
  "22323": "Who be these?",
  "22324": "What follows that angel?",
  "22325": "Will it strengthen our families and support our children?",
  "22326": "Why where should I leave them but where I found them?",
  "22327": "Shall he now be arrested in his desolating career?",
  "22328": "Do you know what that means?",
  "22329": "But why should I make a long story of it?",
  "22330": "Are you not jealous at all?",
  "22331": "And do you believe it to be so?",
  "22332": "Do you take milk in yours?",
  "22333": "What fiend is this?",
  "22334": "Where are they?",
  "22335": "Would any one believe it?",
  "22336": "What if I've accepted too passively the funny form of our life?",
  "22337": "What, indeed, can tend to deprave the character more than outward submission and inward contempt?",
  "22338": "If they bite and kick?",
  "22339": "Is there that about me that should affright a man?",
  "22340": "For how can any experience be adequate with an idea?",
  "22341": "What is this I hear about you?",
  "22342": "How old are you, dear?",
  "22343": "I wonder if they made that fearful sound I heard just before you came?",
  "22344": "What made them kick you out?",
  "22345": "Am I allowed to repeat it?",

  "22382": "Not too difficult?",
  "22383": "Were his father's religious devotion, his teachers warnings, his own knowledge, his own search able to keep him safe?",
  "22384": "Should they be embarked?",

  "22425": "You keep the registers of entries and departures?",
  "22426": "To what tribe do they belong?",
  "22427": "And then?",
  "22428": "It was his life or mine, but far more than that, it was his life or hers, for how could I leave her in the power of this madman?",

  "22435": "You a member here?",
  "22436": "What is your own experience of him?",
  "22437": "Me, young ladies?",
  "22438": "What are these corruptions?",
  "22439": "Why must he look farther than their platform when he claims himself to stand by his platform?",
  "22440": "Now, surely, if he takes so warmly to people who are not related to him at all, may he not take as warmly to his own kin?",

  "22449": "Yes, what were we talking about?",
  "22450": "Do I know them?",
  "22451": "And what business have you here?",
  "22452": "Oh, what's the use of me saying anything?",
  "22453": "I make the first advances?",
  "22454": "Why strive for the knowledge of things if we become more cowardly thereby?",

  "22465": "Will somebody hand me anything hard and bruising to pelt at her?",
  "22466": "Is he industrious at his work and respectful to you?",
  "22467": "Could her face inspire passion at all now?",
  "22468": "And you are not furious?",
  "22469": "Will you let me go away?",
  "22470": "They do, do they?",
  "22471": "Is not the night mournful, sad, and melancholic?",
  "22472": "I asked them, if they were at liberty to tell me the truth of what they were to do with me?",
  "22473": "Why are you sorry, sir?",

  "22484": "Well, did she say what she was coming for?",
  "22485": "How can I ever thank you?",
  "22486": "You own the name and renounce the alias?",
  "22487": "Is he of noble family, and rich?",
  "22488": "How then are we to begin our strike to destroy him?",
  "22489": "Who is this boy?",
  "22490": "And who hit you at all?",
  "22491": "What are these men's leading principles, and about what kind of things are they busy, and for what kind of reasons do they love and honor?",
  "22492": "Thornfield?",
  "22493": "May I ask if you are very busy just now?",
  "22494": "How can it concern him to learn how the self came to be what it is, or what it will be in the distant future?",
  "22495": "But why should I weary you with details?",
  "22496": "So you kept him after all?",
  "22497": "And the queen?",
  "22498": "That we see before our noses?",
  "22499": "Can I never tell my story in a plain, straightforward way?",
  "22500": "Can competition in labor be abolished?",
  "22501": "You cannot help us?",
  "22502": "But what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance?",
  "22503": "What was the use of his being somewhere in the neighbourhood if she had no means of knowing where she could find him?",
  "22504": "You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?",
  "22505": "You will protect me from him?",
  "22506": "Had you heard?",
  "22507": "Can you remember that?",
  "22508": "Ever live by cheating at play?",
  "22509": "Why do you permit such a surgeon to have the care of the sick, wounded, and dying soldiers?",
  "22510": "Why, what is there to understand?",
  "22511": "Yet you have a large establishment, too, I am told?",
  "22512": "And you think that I am going to send you back to that world which must know me no more?",
  "22513": "What is done to infanticides in this country?",
  "22514": "And did you see anyone?",
  "22515": "Well, then, what makes you talk so wild?",
  "22516": "You have formed one, then?",
  "22517": "Will you please pardon my rudeness?",
  "22518": "My dear father, may I beg you to prepare your mind for what I am going to say?",
  "22519": "Would you like me to sit down for a minute or two?",
  "22520": "He is going with you, is he not?",
  "22521": "Of what disposition is he?",
  "22522": "What is it, then?",
  "22523": "What did you expect to gain by that?",
  "22524": "What heart can hold?",
  "22525": "Had he left her there to her fate in the lonely jungle?",
  "22526": "How do you do, all of you?",
  "22527": "Do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not talk as fast, and admire what she admires as rapturously as herself?",
  "22528": "Curious?",
  "22529": "Do you intend to sit up for me?",
  "22530": "But would the man acknowledge the relation?",
  "22531": "What are you doing now?",
  "22532": "Do you suppose that if I had made such a revelation to the king, I should have been alive now?",
  "22533": "He had a passion for pictures, and why should he not be able to paint as well as anybody else?",
  "22534": "Are you the gentleman who caused the accident?",
  "22535": "I know what everyone would say is the right thing to do, but what do you say?",
  "22536": "What difference can it make to you?",
  "22537": "Was he a proprietor, or only a usufructuary?",
  "22538": "You have sold all your clothes?",
  "22539": "Surely you learnt that too?",
  "22540": "WHAT is it?",
  "22541": "But at this moment who knows if we may not be frightfully crushed between the two glassy surfaces?",
  "22542": "Why do you shake me like that?",
  "22543": "Now really should a cock be brought into a tragic play?",
  "22544": "Is his thread spun?",
  "22545": "Is it, then, impossible that, in the present condition of society, the workshop with its hierarchical organization, and machinery, instead of serving exclusively the interests of the least numerous, the least industrious, and the wealthiest class, should be employed for the benefit of all?",
  "22546": "Have not you an intimate friend?",
  "22547": "But how, and wherewith?",
  "22548": "That was a very different account of matters, was it not?",
  "22549": "What laws mean you?",
  "22550": "And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps?",
  "22551": "And on what will you sleep?",
  "22552": "That is what comes of your gospel of love, is it?",
  "22553": "Beautiful?",
  "22554": "Is it really possible that perfectly innocent people are kept here?",
  "22555": "You know the road?",
  "22556": "So if I say they're gone, you'll bear me witness, will you?",
  "22557": "Why should you not mention the sum?",
  "22558": "To what a devil, then, said he, serve so many paltry heaps and bundles of papers and copies which you give me?",
  "22559": "How did you get such small small legs?",
  "22560": "What is that news?",
  "22561": "His nieces accompany him, no doubt?",
  "22562": "Well, but whom are you attacking?",
  "22563": "Am I fool?",
  "22564": "What should hinder it?",
  "22565": "Is this true, my pulse?",
  "22566": "Have you given in your resignation, mademoiselle?",
  "22567": "How can you make yourself so inferior to me, as to show such a bad spirit?",
  "22568": "How can that be managed?",
  "22569": "When shall we be able to fish again?",
  "22570": "And when the better part of their products are consumed by others at the play, do you assure me that their families are not in want?",
  "22571": "Do I combine?",
  "22572": "What good was there in doing that?",
  "22573": "How can you do it seriously?",
  "22574": "Read?",
  "22575": "Was I absurd?",
  "22576": "Live like this?",
  "22577": "And if I could, what comfort to me?",
  "22578": "Aglaya, may I kiss YOUR prince?",
  "22579": "You mean to ask, I said, what will be our answer?",
  "22580": "You do not mean to inherit that infamous crotchet my brother has got into his head?",
  "22581": "Well, what have you got in your ear?",
  "22582": "What came of it?",
  "22583": "What makes it smell so funny?",
  "22584": "Which way are you going?",
  "22585": "Sure, little woman?",
  "22586": "The boy's, then?",
  "22587": "Why do you delay?",
  "22588": "Since no man has aught of what he leaves, what is't to leave betimes?",
  "22589": "How is he?",
  "22590": "Were there not the brilliant particles of a halo in the air about his head?",
  "22591": "I therefore turned towards him with a stern countenance, and asked, who he called fool?",
  "22592": "You want me to swear?",
  "22593": "What you standing there for?",
  "22594": "Perhaps he is just as fond of suffering?",
  "22595": "What's the matter with you, old man?",
  "22596": "Married woman, I believe?",
  "22597": "And the chin, with its dimples, as in health, might it not be hers?",
  "22598": "What will happen then?",
  "22599": "You mean that the thing is supernatural?",
  "22600": "Was it sufficient?",
  "22601": "Have you ever committed a sin?",
  "22602": "Presented to whom?",
  "22603": "Not for myself?",
  "22604": "Well, sir, will you go?",
  "22605": "Where did you go?",
  "22606": "What have we done?",
  "22607": "Do you jog hither, wagging your tails, to pant at my wine, and bepiss my barrel?",
  "22608": "What was going on in congress?",
  "22609": "Do you need a doctor?",
  "22610": "Had he any intellect, any thinking faculty, any consciousness of his own existence?",
  "22611": "Outspoken, is she?",
  "22612": "Is it honouring your husband to dishonour his business?",
  "22613": "To whom resort for relief?",
  "22614": "What must be done then?",
  "22615": "Are yours like that?",
  "22616": "And now, are you aware of one thing, monsieur?",
  "22617": "Is he on this farm?",
  "22618": "Now, did you not think so?",
  "22619": "What do men know about women's martyrdoms?",
  "22620": "What can be done?",
  "22621": "Is the room to be got ready upstairs?",
  "22622": "Will you be silent?",
  "22623": "But how could she?",
  "22624": "How shall I bring forth my wife?",
  "22625": "And the greater the interval which separates them from philosophy and reason, the more strange and illusive will be the pleasure?",
  "22626": "Does he also desire his archic man to be got up in a manner befitting royalty at a certain date?",
  "22627": "What can I do for you, my child?",
  "22628": "Well, the question is, what do you know about her?",
  "22629": "Suppose that she coulde pittie me, what then?",
  "22630": "Where is the child?",
  "22631": "What will you take?",
  "22632": "But who could have foreseen such an attention as this?",
  "22633": "Do you know I have entrusted him with our secret?",
  "22634": "Your sister is dead, then?",
  "22635": "What have I done to displease you?",
  "22636": "How begot, how nourished?",
  "22637": "What was the good of playing?",
  "22638": "Would she not be marvellously fair to look upon when in happy mood, seeing that she is so fair in her displeasure?",
  "22639": "Any youngsters?",
  "22640": "Can a man who possesses the slightest common sense be so unreasonable?",
  "22641": "Have you kept him in the cellar all this time?",
  "22642": "Did either of you boys touch it?",
  "22643": "Arrest you, my most faithful servant?",
  "22644": "Why did she betray the two of them so terribly, in embracing the glow of the evening?",
  "22645": "Are you a missionary?",
  "22646": "And in what condition?",
  "22647": "You serve the cardinal?",
  "22648": "Where is his pistol?",
  "22649": "What DOES it call itself, I wonder?",
  "22650": "Was she not very much surprised?",
  "22651": "But what is that blockhead of a benevolent gentleman doing?",
  "22652": "And how do you know my heart is innocent?",
  "22653": "Shall I leave you?",
  "22654": "His blushes, his stumbles, his awkwardness, and the number of feet which he crushed as he went back to his place, who shall describe or calculate?",
  "22655": "So what does it matter?",
  "22656": "Or whether we should hold that cowardice makes no difference in the end, seeing that we all must share alike?",
  "22657": "You probably are not aware that I am here on a public kind of business, preposterous enough in itself, but which I have gone in for, and sworn by, and am supposed to be devoted to in quite a desperate manner?",
  "22658": "Now, do you find the business good, and the investment advantageous?",
  "22659": "And I dare say you sing a little, too?",
  "22660": "Was she normal?",
  "22661": "This page or this page?",
  "22662": "Will you tell me how that came about?",
  "22663": "For how can we know all the possible cases that may arise?",
  "22664": "Unfortunately, my lord, I am acquainted with nobody here but your grace, and if I should no longer find you, or if you should have forgotten me in your greatness?",
  "22665": "And why should she expect her brother to do that which her brother's guests would decline to do?",
  "22666": "What was there in the young girl's glance on this occasion?",
  "22667": "And then, why did he not at least answer it?",
  "22668": "But where are they, then?",
  "22669": "And then he can write back to my address, and I can smuggle the letter to you?",
  "22670": "What dreadful thing drives her to say this, father, when it is such a pain to her?",
  "22671": "What then, my gentle sister?",
  "22672": "Which of the two will be the first to fall?",
  "22673": "Was this the right corner to turn?",
  "22674": "What are we?",
  "22675": "Who of you have done more?",
  "22676": "Get it?",
  "22677": "Whose hand's out?",
  "22678": "Alas, do you love nothing else in me?",
  "22679": "Shall we send the watch there?",
  "22680": "Would you believe it?",
  "22681": "But you were married?",
  "22682": "Jespersen?",
  "22683": "How is she?",
  "22684": "What do the overhanging warehouses make of that?",
  "22685": "Mathematics?",
  "22686": "And is not the creation of justice the institution of a natural order and government of one by another in the parts of the soul, and the creation of injustice the production of a state of things at variance with the natural order?",
  "22687": "But is it so?",
  "22688": "And with whom?",
  "22689": "What has it turned to, then?",
  "22690": "What would she say if she knew the truth?",
  "22691": "You loved your mother, then?",
  "22692": "I wonder what we both did that for?",
  "22693": "Damn you, sir, will you let me look inside that cab?",
  "22694": "Is there no voice in your mother's heart that forbids you to destroy your son's ideals?",
  "22695": "Been havin' a snooze, ole boy?",
  "22696": "I could even go with you now?",
  "22697": "What shall you wear?",
  "22698": "How large is the garland?",
  "22699": "You are wrong, and what can you do better with your leisure hours?",
  "22700": "What did you do next?",
  "22701": "Well, where are you taking me, then?",
  "22702": "What was it he talked about?",
  "22703": "Will it hold water?",
  "22704": "How shall the lots be drawn?",
  "22705": "Cannot make you understand WHAT?",
  "22706": "What'll they think of us?",
  "22707": "Who would have believed it?",
  "22708": "And turn all the people of the villages against us?",
  "22709": "What's the matter with the old man attending to him personally?",
  "22710": "Would you like supper?",
  "22711": "What do you say, monsieur?",
  "22712": "Do you want to know what it is in him?",
  "22713": "And why would you either?",
  "22714": "Will you wait here?",
  "22715": "Doctor seen them?",
  "22716": "Talk about men who deserve the name, can any man deserving the name waste his time in that effeminate way, when he sees half the world going to ruin for want of somebody to buckle to and teach them how to breast the misery they are born to?",
  "22717": "So there's nothing?",
  "22718": "And shall we eat bread?",
  "22719": "Ankle all right, eh?",
  "22720": "But who was she?",
  "22721": "Why should there often be so great a difference in the result of a reciprocal cross between the same two species?",
  "22722": "Is there any better or equal hope in the world?",
  "22723": "But I wanted to ask you directly what you think of me, of my life?",
  "22724": "Are you quite impervious to good advice?",
  "22725": "What is the matter with me?",
  "22726": "Did you see herself?",
  "22727": "Are we lovers?",
  "22728": "And how could you think o' going to the pond, and taking your sister where there was dirt?",
  "22729": "What lineage, what lineage?",

  "23114": "And are not those petty, tormenting cares less hurtful than a continual brooding over the great affliction that oppresses us?",
  "23115": "And you will be satisfied with no other wages than your food?",
  "23116": "Why, whatever makes you think that?",
  "23117": "Justify it?",
  "23118": "And you do joy to see me thwacked about on the ribs?",
  "23119": "But who was that possessor?",
  "23120": "Why then should you keep on being so angry with him?",
  "23121": "O heauens, why made you night, to couer sinne?",
  "23122": "Is it not to feed the hungry, to aid in their deliverance by the means which faith suggests?",
  "23123": "Might they not have been lost by some of these people in one of their landings?",
  "23124": "Who's that mug?",
  "23125": "Are you doing anything tonight?",
  "23126": "What were your parents?",
  "23127": "But what words did he say?",
  "23128": "Not at all?",
  "23129": "In how long?",
  "23130": "Shall we call this the promised land?",
  "23131": "What did you commit by so acting?",
  "23132": "Acquitted the culprits and condemned the innocent, have you?",
  "23133": "How then should the news alluded to have escaped me?",
  "23134": "Well, captain?",
  "23135": "Why should he be pacing his room all the time?",
  "23136": "Oh well, lend me five bob, will you?",
  "23137": "Sucking his drink?",
  "23138": "But have you no relatives?",
  "23139": "Does the comparison require much time or labor?",
  "23140": "How much did it cost you?",
  "23141": "Who are you going to tackle first?",
  "23142": "Have a drink with you?",
  "23143": "Has that dog stopped shivering yet?",
  "23144": "Under what circumstances did you see him?",
  "23145": "Did they come ashore here?",
  "23146": "And from what?",
  "23147": "But do you know who that lady is you talk about in such a fashion?",
  "23148": "But what is the matter, my boy?",
  "23149": "And you fancy he will not put his maxim into execution, now that he has got hold of the king?",
  "23150": "And where is the governor?",
  "23151": "His sister worked also but what could she do with seven little children?",
  "23152": "Save me from death?",

  "23159": "Then, where are you now?",
  "23160": "Am I to call in any assistance, or is the trick done?",
  "23161": "And half of what you had was hers?",
  "23162": "What must they think as they see us sailing in the air?",
  "23163": "Now, will you come upstairs?",
  "23164": "A lump of wax?",
  "23165": "Do you know what it means?",
  "23166": "Is anything the matter, sir?",
  "23167": "Do you think you'll be able to get through?",
  "23168": "Is there no guarantee for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness?",
  "23169": "Do you think he is hopeful?",
  "23170": "What will be the conclusion?",
  "23171": "And with you, ma'am?",
  "23172": "Just thinking what?",
  "23173": "You know the contents of this letter, no doubt?",
  "23174": "What do you wonder at?",
  "23175": "Who made these dissimilarities?",
  "23176": "A miser?",
  "23177": "Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the hangman who would gain his fee?",
  "23178": "You know what I mean?",
  "23179": "Can you read it?",
  "23180": "What med you be up to?",
  "23181": "D'you reckon he knowed anything?",
  "23182": "Suppose we sell off all the horses, and sell one of your farms, and pay up square?",
  "23183": "What if he should be no gentleman now, but a clown indeed, lady?",
  "23184": "Who, his parents?",
  "23185": "May I go with you?",
  "23186": "Do you see it?",
  "23187": "Where can you begin?",
  "23188": "Will your eminence please read and examine?",
  "23189": "Where did the shipwreck occur?",
  "23190": "Did one ever hear of such a thing?",
  "23191": "Is anything the matter?",
  "23192": "What you demand of me is serious, then?",
  "23193": "What then, in the name of heaven, could you go to war for?",
  "23194": "What must one day come and may not pass by?",
  "23195": "Well, madame?",
  "23196": "Have you got the cartridges?",
  "23197": "To go with you for?",
  "23198": "Is there no debt to pay, no boon to grant?",
  "23199": "Then, perhaps, you cannot tell me what sort of a woman she is?",
  "23200": "Ye are frightened?",
  "23201": "But how in the world did you know that he was in the house at all?",
  "23202": "May I venture to congratulate you?",
  "23203": "A successor?",
  "23204": "Shall not we two lie on the bridal bed this same night?",
  "23205": "Did all enjoy it?",
  "23206": "How was it wrought to such perfection?",
  "23207": "Am I likely to be frozen?",
  "23208": "A presentation?",
  "23209": "Why did you?",
  "23210": "The decline of his fortunes, then?",
  "23211": "What was the cause of such degeneration?",
  "23212": "They are coming, then?",
  "23213": "Who is to throw a stone?",
  "23214": "How so, my pet?",
  "23215": "Ambulance or train?",
  "23216": "Dare I ask you to explain?",
  "23217": "Only what are we to talk about?",
  "23218": "Again, if there be nothing real in the universe, what is it that causes unreal objects to appear?",
  "23219": "What do you want of me?",
  "23220": "Not the old business?",
  "23221": "Somebody was coming?",
  "23222": "Mad one, what have I said?",

  "23234": "And so many children poor?",
  "23235": "Are not the roofs and the lintels wet?",
  "23236": "At what time did he go?",
  "23237": "Then how could they tear me pitilessly from all that was dear to me, and lock me up in prison like a wild animal?",
  "23238": "And who's to make him?",
  "23239": "How did the boat strike when she went in?",
  "23240": "How hight she?",

  "23250": "Who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads?",
  "23251": "Who's over me?",
  "23252": "Why, in the devil's name, have they served me thus?",
  "23253": "You know her husband, of course?",
  "23254": "Is it possible that the meaning of life was not disclosed to him before he died?",
  "23255": "Are you brutes?",
  "23256": "In fact, what is to be expected in any country where taste and cultivation of mind do not supply the place of youthful beauty and animal spirits?",
  "23257": "Think it'll ride?",
  "23258": "What'll the other people in the house say to my being here?",
  "23259": "But was it all there was of life?",
  "23260": "What private box?",
  "23261": "Nor written?",
  "23262": "Consequently, a capital blade?",
  "23263": "And break it out?",
  "23264": "He has the horse, then?",
  "23265": "The entrance cannot be easy?",
  "23266": "Why do I not give it?",
  "23267": "And does that hinder you from letting me know the second reason?",
  "23268": "Clarence?",
  "23269": "Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy?",
  "23270": "Why did you play us such a trick, damn you?",
  "23271": "What is his object?",
  "23272": "What would happen next?",
  "23273": "Who might do this but the women?",
  "23274": "Do you know that?",
  "23275": "Why, my dear friend, do I not see you?",
  "23276": "But, in truth, what is the good of these disguises?",
  "23277": "Will that restore it to sight?",
  "23278": "Where is this person?",
  "23279": "What can a man spend his ha'pence on here in this country hole?",
  "23280": "Catharine, did I do wrong?",
  "23281": "How much are you out of pocket?",
  "23282": "And if difficulties were necessary to increase the splendor of the effort, what could be harder for a restless, ambitious girl than to give up her own hopes, plans, and desires, and cheerfully live for others?",
  "23283": "Could we advertise, then, asking for information from wharfingers?",
  "23284": "Does this infinite awaken in us the idea of essence, while we can attribute to ourselves only the idea of existence?",
  "23285": "We will say ten o'clock then?",
  "23286": "To its honors, to its flowers, to its golden aspirations?",
  "23287": "But always smelling those leather books, what can be expected?",
  "23288": "Is it not time for a change?",
  "23289": "What did happen to me?",
  "23290": "Do you think now that I shall tell you what motive he had had in starting out?",
  "23291": "You perhaps think I should have expected this refusal?",
  "23292": "And your cargo?",
  "23293": "Not related to her, sir?",
  "23294": "But, they say, is that true right, social right, fraternal right?",
  "23295": "Do you know, sir, that that man did all this?",
  "23296": "Did he give you anything else?",
  "23297": "Why should he die, for he felt that he could not live, under such a weight of obloquy?",
  "23298": "It's he then who has told you?",
  "23299": "Is that all?",
  "23300": "Took?",
  "23301": "How much do you know?",
  "23302": "Why was it none would give it, then?",
  "23303": "Shall they be banished from the district, or from the whole land?",
  "23304": "Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?",
  "23305": "And who wants to be acquainted with you?",
  "23306": "Are you in love with the cows?",
  "23307": "Not to her uncle?",
  "23308": "Why should it not, at a certain depth, attain an impassable limit, instead of rising to such a point as to fuse the most infusible metals?",
  "23309": "But why have you done it at all?",
  "23310": "And what does this groom do?",
  "23311": "Sun in your eyes and his face in the shadow?",
  "23312": "Would she hear of his being slapped and beat by drummers demnebly?",
  "23313": "Are we at the pole?",
  "23314": "Do you hear, do you hear what he says?",
  "23315": "Was he again to be disturbed?",
  "23316": "Was she going to act and keep house?",
  "23317": "Was that his work or was it possibly the doing of someone who was bent upon counteracting his schemes?",
  "23318": "Two minutes wrong?",
  "23319": "Do you not guess, monsieur?",
  "23320": "Where's your horse?",
  "23321": "Will you give me something to eat and a bed?",
  "23322": "What would they do to assist them?",
  "23323": "Let us have the land?",
  "23324": "Might I ask you, sir, to pacify my mind?",
  "23325": "It is difficult to rise above the jungle standards and reason by the light of civilized ways, is it not, my friend?",
  "23326": "What about your government and all this treatment?",
  "23327": "What the devil are you doing?",
  "23328": "What help is to be hoped for, what consolation, what solace?",
  "23329": "Or, may we not owe their visit to the dead colt?",
  "23330": "Where shall we search for him?",
  "23331": "Why should you keep such things from me?",
  "23332": "What about the dough?",
  "23333": "Can she have loved my brother so little as to be able to forget him so soon?",
  "23334": "What thing?",
  "23335": "Do you suppose she takes you for a symbol?",
  "23336": "Has she run away because we are come?",
  "23337": "Shall I tell her or not?",
  "23338": "But then, why had he permitted that man to leave him alive?",
  "23339": "What's that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for?",
  "23340": "On which of these actions did he reflect with the most pleasure, when he was summoned by the angel of death?",
  "23341": "What was in there?",
  "23342": "But tell me, what is she?",
  "23343": "Is he ungrateful to no one else?",
  "23344": "Aye, how do you know he is?",
  "23345": "Does our friend eke out his modest income with a crossing?",
  "23346": "The stag spoke?",
  "23347": "What are the dangers which menace us?",
  "23348": "Monsieur does not then renounce his excursion for this evening?",
  "23349": "You imagine, I dare say, that you invented something quite new?",
  "23350": "Is there anything in what I say, or am I talking to no purpose?",
  "23351": "Was he already with the queen?",
  "23352": "What is the matter, that with all his ill usage of me, I cannot hate him?",
  "23353": "Now, I beseech you, do tell me, have you ever attended to their pairing and breeding?",
  "23354": "Oh, what have I done to be blessed with such friends?",
  "23355": "Two one pound notes, or friends?",
  "23356": "Why indeed should they maintain a watch?",
  "23357": "What was I to do?",
  "23358": "So will you abandon your plan?",
  "23359": "What can I say that will enable you to understand the depth of my sorrow?",
  "23360": "Did she still love him?",
  "23361": "And of the pleasures of love, and all other pleasures, the same holds good?",
  "23362": "What does she want?",
  "23363": "Will it be safe to leave you there alone?",
  "23364": "In your room?",
  "23365": "Can dignity of mind exist with such trivial cares?",
  "23366": "And what shall we have in lieu of it?",
  "23367": "It is a lovely night, and why should we not prolong our ride a little?",
  "23368": "You will not come?",
  "23369": "For arrears of pay?",
  "23370": "And is the city which is under a tyrant rich or poor?",
  "23371": "Was it not too clear that, let the matter go how it would, there was no happiness in store for her?",
  "23372": "Would you kindly send one of your constables for two buckets of water?",
  "23373": "But what is there, then, above the sun?",
  "23374": "To conceal his name?",
  "23375": "Is it at some set season?",
  "23376": "Did she know anything of his life upon the sea?",
  "23377": "Where is so awful a responsibility laid upon them?",
  "23378": "Well, my boy, what's there to prevent you?",
  "23379": "What more natural, after this, than the dream which came to him?",
  "23380": "If vices be genuine and virtue a deception, as you think, why do you call the inventors of that deceiving art sages?",
  "23381": "Has the law any eyes to witness your grief?",
  "23382": "How can I be vain when I know I'm homely?",
  "23383": "Kicked on that occasion for cheating at dice?",
  "23384": "What proofs do you require?",
  "23385": "On business, eh?",
  "23386": "Why, what's happened?",
  "23387": "Not hurt you, did I?",
  "23388": "Was it the time the sandy cat walked round the balustrade?",
  "23389": "And how does any one know whether he will stay days, months, or years?",
  "23390": "Well, how are you going to get out of that?",
  "23391": "Have you your stethoscope?",
  "23392": "Well, where can we find it?",
  "23393": "Was it mere social effect, fulfilment of ambition in the social world, in the community of mankind?",
  "23394": "How about this ad of yours?",
  "23395": "Must we then not be married, in order to sanctify the union of our hearts?",
  "23396": "Ay, but will you promise to come?",
  "23397": "What did you write about?",
  "23398": "Perhaps you are laughing again?",
  "23399": "So you think that these people have already quitted the island?",
  "23400": "What's a lad with good friends doing as loblolly boy?",
  "23401": "Who can tell if that mind, when the touchstone is applied to it, will not be found of a mean and vulgar character?",
  "23402": "But what time's breakfast, sir?",
  "23403": "Did you signal us, lording?",
  "23404": "Where was you raised?",
  "23405": "May I read it?",
  "23406": "Where is the treasure?",
  "23407": "You know?",
  "23408": "Snatch at it?",
  "23409": "Would not this mode of proceeding be preferable to that of causing letters to be opened by any one who may be employed, and replying to them by a circular to which it is only necessary to attach a date?",
  "23410": "Well, what say you to a friend that would take this bitter bargain off your hands?",
  "23411": "What will you do, dear?",
  "23412": "Is it a profession?",
  "23413": "You admit you owe him three pounds then for a month's board?",
  "23414": "Have I not found her friendless, and cold, and comfortless?",
  "23415": "Is he learned?",
  "23416": "Ay, where are they?",
  "23417": "Why should he feel joy at turning back?",
  "23418": "Must I really?",
  "23419": "And shall I not do as the first man?",
  "23420": "Was I not a fool, when I refused to look at or speak to him?",
  "23421": "And may we say that this has been proven?",
  "23422": "Does she cook the dinner?",
  "23423": "She was confined at your house, was she not?",
  "23424": "Very well what did I say to you?",
  "23425": "Father, have you any objection to my going away?",
  "23426": "And you are afraid I shall be unhappy?",
  "23427": "To reign in my place and stead?",
  "23428": "I suppose?",
  "23429": "Does the day look clear again?",
  "23430": "What if I were to think a little about others?",
  "23431": "Why on earth did you shut yourself in?",
  "23432": "Do you really suppose?",
  "23433": "Is not that the bishop?",
  "23434": "Why will you ruin yourself, your family, and nation?",
  "23435": "Why such a hard sentence?",
  "23436": "Will he not fancy that the shadows which he formerly saw are truer than the objects which are now shown to him?",
  "23437": "May I go and see her?",
  "23438": "Where did you go this morning?",
  "23439": "Well, sir, in writing against property, have I done more than quote the language of history?",
  "23440": "I unhappy?",
  "23441": "But how did he come by his death?",
  "23442": "Can you believe it?",
  "23443": "Do you think that was done last night?",
  "23444": "Which is the way to the chapel?",
  "23445": "May we, then, be permitted to speak of the past in the present?",
  "23446": "What victim?",
  "23447": "Do we not own the country?",
  "23448": "Raoul, did you ever see anybody hung?",
  "23449": "May I be permitted a word or two of advice?",
  "23450": "What would they think of me?",
  "23451": "What says the abbe?",
  "23452": "Might it not be that she would calculate that an interview would thus be possible?",
  "23453": "Why linger to add to the number of the victims of our merciless enemies?",
  "23454": "What is bad?",
  "23455": "And what now?",
  "23456": "Was he actually in hiding from the police?",
  "23457": "Shall he in the meantime risk the character and interest of the nation in the hands of men to whom he can not give his confidence?",
  "23458": "In the tremendous breaking forth of a whole people, in which all degrees, tempers and characters are confounded, delivering themselves, by a miracle of exertion, from the destruction meditated against them, is it to be expected that nothing will happen?",
  "23459": "But how was it possible to effect this?",
  "23460": "And look you, lord, times are not ill, so wherefore should I risk a change of days?",
  "23461": "That certainly seems a satisfactory explanation, does it not?",
  "23462": "You have my birth certificate?",
  "23463": "Is it an odd speech, papa?",
  "23464": "Had you not observed it before?",
  "23465": "Who would attend him when he was sick?",
  "23466": "Till to your very doors the war be brought?",
  "23467": "A sleeping draught?",
  "23468": "Philip?",
  "23469": "But they may come any moment, for you left word that I awaited them?",
  "23470": "Why, indeed?",
  "23471": "Shall you?",
  "23472": "But how came the hand to discompose you so much, if it was only a letter of business?",
  "23473": "Why did this sudden conviction of a religious woman cast a terrible doubt in my mind?",
  "23474": "Was that then he or an inhuman thing moved by a lower soul?",
  "23475": "And the power which the eye possesses is a sort of effluence which is dispensed from the sun?",
  "23476": "What was one to think or feel?",
  "23477": "Can you tell the position of the rooms?",
  "23478": "To defend ourselves against attack?",
  "23479": "The child?",
  "23480": "When shall I have the answer, monseigneur?",
  "23481": "But where does it stay?",
  "23482": "D'you like that?",
  "23483": "You know that to be so?",
  "23484": "Was it possible to render any aid to the dying man?",
  "23485": "Has she mentioned me lately?",
  "23486": "And what your sorrow?",
  "23487": "Did you speak, my own?",
  "23488": "Is it only a voice?",
  "23489": "Why wonder about this?",
  "23490": "Did he not advertise?",
  "23491": "In what manner?",
  "23492": "What would they do if they found me?",
  "23493": "But how can I pay them?",
  "23494": "Away from me?",
  "23495": "And, if so, surely there is good material in you?",
  "23496": "What was the matter with you, baron?",
  "23497": "May I have the honour?",
  "23498": "Will you come into the garden?",
  "23499": "Will it satisfy them, in the future, if we have nothing to do with invasions and insurrections?",
  "23500": "But what are we to do with her when we have caught her?",

  "25289": "When you know it, what will it do but aggravate your troubles?",
  "25290": "Are you of stout heart?",
  "25291": "Will you enquire yourself?",
  "25292": "Are you mad, that you speak of such things, or am I mad to listen to them?",
  "25293": "In face of such reproaches who will wed?",
  "25294": "Come, girls, what do you stand there for, twirling of your thumbs?",
  "25295": "What kind of a fool's counsel was I giving him?",

  "25315": "Why not animal flesh?",
  "25316": "Where are you from?",
  "25317": "What, these waggons may coldly exclude?",
  "25318": "Does not the divine appear to you to be that which naturally orders and rules, and the mortal to be that which is subject and servant?",
  "25319": "Is it not probable that one who, out of doors, goes thus exposed to the cold, must want food and other necessaries at home?",
  "25320": "Where am I to find him?",
  "25321": "Did he come on purpose?",
  "25322": "Where in the world am I to look for him?",

  "25442": "What do I make of it?",
  "25443": "All that tempest, all that cloud, that war, then that peace?",
  "25444": "But what motive had they in advising, from which so great a disaster was the result?",
  "25445": "What is the news?",
  "25446": "How else do you think I could educate them at all?",
  "25447": "How far is it now to the inn?",
  "25448": "Why do you feel so bad about that affair of this morning?",
  "25449": "Do you know the relief that my disappearance will be?",
  "25450": "Or will he be carried away by the stream?",
  "25451": "Have you forgotten that when you were in trouble I did everything for you?",
  "25452": "But what is it, then, that I am accused of?",
  "25453": "Or that night, when I frowned at him?",
  "25454": "With the prince still?",
  "25455": "If a man had stolen a pound in his youth and had used that pound to amass a huge fortune how much was he obliged to give back, the pound he had stolen only or the pound together with the compound interest accruing upon it or all his huge fortune?",
  "25456": "Do you recognize that, miss?",
  "25457": "Had not all the other places refused her because she did not know something or other?",
  "25458": "What could be the trouble?",
  "25459": "Oh, is that it?",
  "25460": "Well, then, how is it that your eminence complained just now of want of information?",
  "25461": "What would they say, who made so light of money, if they could know how I had scraped my halfpence together, for the purchase of my daily saveloy and beer, or my slices of pudding?",
  "25462": "Had he the right to compel this sacrifice, knowing, realizing, as he did, that his child had based all the happiness of her life on the career she was now voluntarily giving up for his sake?",
  "25463": "Here, on the verandah?",
  "25464": "And how could this be properly explained to the young lady in gentle terms?",
  "25465": "Do you think it's because I'm really bad and unregenerate?",
  "25466": "Are you not?",
  "25467": "Then how about our position?",
  "25468": "And will he not?",
  "25469": "What recompense can we present?",
  "25470": "The principle is the same, I think?",
  "25471": "What happens in so many cases?",
  "25472": "Then we must have known equality previously to the time when we first saw the material equals, and reflected that all these apparent equals strive to attain absolute equality, but fall short of it?",
  "25473": "And since then?",
  "25474": "And as to her face, could it inspire nothing but passion?",
  "25475": "What was it then, and how had it affected his fate?",
  "25476": "Manager to a diamond merchant, or some such thing, is he not?",
  "25477": "And he does forgive?",
  "25478": "When all that failed, he boldly accosted him, and asked him, whether he did not remember him?",
  "25479": "Or, whither he should go?",
  "25480": "But we shall see you at the musicale this afternoon, shall we not?",
  "25481": "Should possibilities be worse to bear than certainties?",
  "25482": "And when is this to be consummated?",
  "25483": "And what did they say?",
  "25484": "Is there a single sentiment it does not condemn?",
  "25485": "What are you stopping for?",
  "25486": "Do you want to work?",
  "25487": "Why are we now in the mansions of the rich and great, my friends?",
  "25488": "Are there many more?",
  "25489": "You can stay some time?",
  "25490": "Was he commencing to suspect?",
  "25491": "And in like manner does the touch adequately perceive the qualities of thickness or thinness, or softness or hardness?",
  "25492": "When you came in at the gate and asked the watchman the way here, had you any one with you?",
  "25493": "Where did your instructions come from?",
  "25494": "Why, then, monseigneur does not know?",
  "25495": "But, gentlemen, why are you getting angry again?",
  "25496": "And now it is you who have brought them together again?",
  "25497": "Was there not a spirit in him which, silent as it was, burned on him like the fires of perdition?",
  "25498": "Hurt you?",
  "25499": "What visions, they asked, could one but read them, must lie behind the quiet, dreaming eyes of that inscrutable face?",
  "25500": "What resources could they expect to find upon that scene of desolation?",
  "25501": "Are you nothing?",
  "25502": "But what could have frightened the creatures so, and driven them from their haunts, when they ought to have been quietly sleeping?",
  "25503": "Or would you include the mixed?",
  "25504": "Was it a screw or thrust?",
  "25505": "Ah, then, is THAT what you've stayed over for?",
  "25506": "Do you know that he's the honestest and faithfullest fellow that ever lived, and that he has an irreproachable good name?",
  "25507": "What do you think of it, now?",
  "25508": "Always busy at what?",
  "25509": "Is it finished?",
  "25510": "What do you mean?",
  "25511": "Do you hesitate?",
  "25512": "I like the baron, but what better gifts can marriage bestow, than I already possess?",
  "25513": "What's he?",
  "25514": "Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?",
  "25515": "Silver?",
  "25516": "Are we going to continue this pace all night?",
  "25517": "Can I be so lucky as to find what everybody is seeking for?",
  "25518": "Face?",
  "25519": "What else have you done?",
  "25520": "It stung you up a bit when I spoke of your game leg, young fellow?",
  "25521": "Sire, will you allow me to speak frankly as befits a loyal soldier?",
  "25522": "Then why speak to me about it?",
  "25523": "What the devil do I do?",
  "25524": "Who would ever know?",
  "25525": "Was I very gleeful, settled, content, during the hours I passed in yonder bare, humble schoolroom this morning and afternoon?",
  "25526": "Who will shrive the poor wretch, if you have come away from him?",
  "25527": "Why should I do so?",
  "25528": "And then she could not help remembering that he had passed some time with her under like circumstances, so why should there be any unfitness in the fact?",
  "25529": "Must he not have the qualities of a sage?",
  "25530": "Why is the sycophant thus added to the hypocrite, and the man who pretends to govern, sunk into the humble and submissive memorialist?",
  "25531": "Well, have we attained our end there also?",
  "25532": "From the dry rock who bade the waters flow?",
  "25533": "Do you observe that we were not far wrong in our guess that temperance was a sort of harmony?",
  "25534": "Whatever her sins, they were not sins of intention, but of inadvertence, and why should she have been punished so persistently?",
  "25535": "What was the bargain?",
  "25536": "And his dog also?",
  "25537": "Must I call you a liar as well as a thief?",
  "25538": "If he could not speak, how was she to do so?",
  "25539": "And he will accomplish the trip?",
  "25540": "Is he mad?",
  "25541": "What is she there for?",
  "25542": "YOU insulted ME?",
  "25543": "And now, matey, did that doctor say how long I was to lie here in this old berth?",
  "25544": "My companion?",
  "25545": "Game for a morning drive?",
  "25546": "You know where you left the team?",
  "25547": "How much have you lost?",
  "25548": "Why do you want to start on that again?",
  "25549": "And you yourself, what do you think about it?",
  "25550": "Must we, then, give up to despair?",
  "25551": "But where the devil are you?",
  "25552": "Living?",
  "25553": "Do you know what you have said?",
  "25554": "Well, and what has she been doing?",
  "25555": "Shall we not spend our immortal life together?",
  "25556": "Would this political deterrence prove acceptable to allies and to our own public?",
  "25557": "Should not all they be called mercenary who are always seeking consolations?",
  "25558": "Where is it, then?",
  "25559": "Do you really mean that?",
  "25560": "How could you get across?",
  "25561": "Can I take her into the spare room to lay off her hat when she comes?",
  "25562": "In case of doubt, shall it award the property to the first occupant?",
  "25563": "And the sago?",
  "25564": "You have not wanted for anything, vicomte, in my absence, have you?",
  "25565": "Who knows the will of heaven?",
  "25566": "Who's the object of your meditation, sir?",
  "25567": "Would you not say that he is entirely concerned with the soul and not with the body?",
  "25568": "Have we not?",
  "25569": "What does she think herself about him?",
  "25570": "Do you hate me so much as all that?",
  "25571": "Is not this to be rich?",
  "25572": "Should you like to retire at once?",
  "25573": "Will you ever go back?",
  "25574": "Why conceal your real feelings?",
  "25575": "In a hospital?",
  "25576": "Have you no information as to his abiding place?",
  "25577": "What's your names?",
  "25578": "For what reason is all this fume and fury?",
  "25579": "Of the painter we say that he will paint reins, and he will paint a bit?",
  "25580": "Will you ride on a few paces with the princess?",
  "25581": "Can you wash your own hands, or shall I wash them for you?",
  "25582": "And when shall we have the honor of seeing you again, your excellency?",
  "25583": "Are you interested in the sugar question?",
  "25584": "And they will go in three days now?",
  "25585": "But what good could he have done if he had?",
  "25586": "And what probability was there that a mere drudge would be able to manage a large and stormy assembly, abounding with able and experienced men?",
  "25587": "Gave him leave?",
  "25588": "You have, then, overheard our conversation?",
  "25589": "Will they sacrifice opportunity for the distressed, the beauty of our land, the hope of our poor?",
  "25590": "Esther, will you forgive me?",
  "25591": "Was this not preventing any inquiry, and, at the same time, assuming a higher ground through this pretended fascination exercised over a man who must have been of warlike nature and accustomed to receive homage?",
  "25592": "For what end are her fair complexities, her changes of soil, her sinuous coast?",
  "25593": "What was to be done with them?",
  "25594": "What must I know?",
  "25595": "Would you four stand up for a moment?",
  "25596": "Is it not on this order of release?",
  "25597": "And, still further, I am tempted to inquire what has become of the indigent scholars, the sons of the masses of the people whose daily labour just suffices to meet their daily wants, for whose benefit these rich foundations were largely, if not mainly, instituted?",
  "25598": "There is nothing in my house for you, do you hear?",
  "25599": "On what ground shall we persuade the contented egoist, who has but a handful of commonplace desires and finds it possible to satisfy most of them, that it is better to call into being a multitude of wants many of which will probably remain unrealized?",
  "25600": "Do you hear now?",
  "25601": "What fog?",
  "25602": "Who was there present?",
  "25603": "What interest, I say, what interest do you ask?",
  "25604": "Not sick, are you?",
  "25605": "But what if I were mistaken?",
  "25606": "Then do you yourself know?",
  "25607": "Why should you, of all people, be so passionate about it?",
  "25608": "Fifty cents a pound, was it?",
  "25609": "Do you acknowledge your faults?",
  "25610": "How can its error, being universal, be capable of correction?",
  "25611": "What had fate in store for these daring adventurers?",
  "25612": "Who do these three cavaliers appear to you to be?",
  "25613": "Are you still intimate with her?",
  "25614": "Or I my brains?",
  "25615": "Has anyone assaulted you?",
  "25616": "Is it in vain our conquering arms subdue?",
  "25617": "That idea is your own, and yours solely?",
  "25618": "Why have you never told me?",
  "25619": "Where are you going now?",
  "25620": "You will not say it?",
  "25621": "What are we going to do?",
  "25622": "How about these papers?",
  "25623": "Will nobody say what is the matter?",
  "25624": "But why should I repine?",
  "25625": "I must be trembling, does it not show in my writing?",
  "25626": "How had it come to pass that matters which with others are so private, should with her have become the public property of so large a circle?",
  "25627": "Where is the man who can say the fault, in part, has not been his?",
  "25628": "You would allow, I said, that there is in nature an upper and lower and middle region?",
  "25629": "Well, and what do you think?",
  "25630": "Have we lost the power of rendering you happy?",
  "25631": "Why not, sire?",
  "25632": "Are you sure that you do not falter or fear?",
  "25633": "And what can we do there?",
  "25634": "Want money?",
  "25635": "You're not going to be silly about it, are you?",
  "25636": "And have you ever seen her by any chance?",
  "25637": "You have heard nothing to the contrary, have you?",
  "25638": "Did you find him, gossip?",
  "25639": "Is it all over?",
  "25640": "What's that, sir?",
  "25641": "That you fled from your husband?",
  "25642": "Remember where he said the book was?",
  "25643": "And now, when shall we meet again?",
  "25644": "Did I say anything that was inconsistent with his having seen it before?",
  "25645": "Iron what?",
  "25646": "Can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than laws can among friends?",
  "25647": "Why contend?",
  "25648": "But may not this inference be presumptuous?",
  "25649": "What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant?",
  "25650": "And how have you wriggled onto the staff?",
  "25651": "What's the matter, then?",
  "25652": "Does he know you are going to be married?",
  "25653": "Are they not lovely?",
  "25654": "What would you do, then?",
  "25655": "You remember, I was proclaimed four years ago?",
  "25656": "Was he bent, then, upon ruining me?",
  "25657": "Why scare people?",
  "25658": "Where am I to let you know to?",
  "25659": "Any fault there?",
  "25660": "Where did you get that donkey head?",
  "25661": "Was anybody here just now?",
  "25662": "Who would these be?",
  "25663": "Of her character?",
  "25664": "Like my father?",
  "25665": "Yes, and why did you go in?",
  "25666": "In which world?",
  "25667": "You have arms, I suppose?",
  "25668": "Where are you bound for?",
  "25669": "And of what kind of trees?",
  "25670": "Going to college, I suppose?",
  "25671": "What's gone of your father and your mother, eh?",
  "25672": "Do you suppose they'll ever dance together?",
  "25673": "Do they imagine at home that I am so inexpert in the theory of drama as not to know this?",
  "25674": "What did you cut it off for, then?",
  "25675": "Johnson?",
  "25676": "What good is it then for the ball to be thrown up, or harm for it to come down, or even to have fallen?",
  "25677": "Do you play much?",
  "25678": "How do you know it is not too late?",
  "25679": "Can man breathe this polluted air and live?",
  "25680": "WHY DIED I NOT FROM THE WOMB?",
  "25681": "What else could it be that made me pass such a terrible night?",
  "25682": "Is he in the house now?",
  "25683": "Have you nothing to add?",
  "25684": "Does the straw bother you, mate?",
  "25685": "My footprint, I presume?",
  "25686": "Would you like it again?",
  "25687": "Where is he going?",
  "25688": "Give me what you took from me, will you?",
  "25689": "Are you going to marry him?",
  "25690": "But she's got her faults, you mean to say?",
  "25691": "Is he a good workman?",
  "25692": "Who might have done that, I wonder?",
  "25693": "How long do you remain here, prince?",
  "25694": "Since I've been away?",
  "25695": "Ruined?",
  "25696": "Is the law of universal gravitation the law of universal nonsense?",
  "25697": "Will you give a man with this much information a vote?",
  "25698": "I say is dis me?",
  "25699": "Have you not received my letters?",
  "25700": "You want to humble me, do you?",
  "25701": "Do you see anything else?",
  "25702": "How could I after all the fuss?",
  "25703": "Perhaps it was not quite wise of you to come home?",
  "25704": "When do you think of going down?",
  "25705": "Have you not every indulgence which you are capable of enjoying?",
  "25706": "Will you open the case?",
  "25707": "Better than you did?",
  "25708": "Que gusta usted?",
  "25709": "But on what special grounds do you base your idea that these signatures are false?",
  "25710": "Why, have you too much money?",
  "25711": "What would you have?",
  "25712": "Who commissioned you to manage this affair?",
  "25713": "Are they not above all nations divided from the rest of the world, insular both in situation and in mind, both for good and for evil?",
  "25714": "May I?",
  "25715": "How shall I ever bring round to my adventurous views those whom I propose to desert?",
  "25716": "Did I have a father and mother?",
  "25717": "Do you remember me?",
  "25718": "But why do I thus torment myself?",
  "25719": "Are these lenses capable of resisting such pressure?",
  "25720": "How, then, could they catch it?",
  "25721": "A how much?",
  "25722": "We should, never quarrel, should we after we were used to each other?",
  "25723": "And how did it begin to be his?",
  "25724": "Cannot one see the little boy doubling his little fists, a knife in his pocket, possibly a ball of string?",
  "25725": "Are there other doctors' new names, disciples who have not burdened their souls with tape?",
  "25726": "You mean the threat in her husband's letter?",
  "25727": "What will be the fairest way of considering the question?",
  "25728": "And if I prize so highly these two things, who could estimate the value of what remains?",
  "25729": "But was that all her reward?",
  "25730": "Then opinion and knowledge have to do with different kinds of matter corresponding to this difference of faculties?",
  "25731": "Why, what good should I get else from his instruction?",
  "25732": "Is this the first time you have left your parents to come to school, my little girl?",
  "25733": "What's here?",
  "25734": "In qua te quero proseucha?",
  "25735": "You will be lucky if they take you, but what if you are still of use to the madam here?",
  "25736": "Where forbidden?",
  "25737": "What did I say, naow?",
  "25738": "And then what if he did not?",
  "25739": "Do I make myself plain?",
  "25740": "But was there no movement, no signs of any intention to advance to our relief?",
  "25741": "All like ours?",
  "25742": "Whom?",
  "25743": "Could it be?",
  "25744": "In forming a constitution, it is first necessary to consider what are the ends for which government is necessary?",
  "25745": "Have you been advising him since?",
  "25746": "I wonder what that means?",
  "25747": "What, it's still there then, is it?",
  "25748": "And what of the ignorant?",
  "25749": "Did you think to stay your hand by doing so?",
  "25750": "Fixed her?",
  "25751": "For what else?",
  "25752": "How then shall we adjust those principles together?",
  "25753": "Who are they from?",
  "25754": "If there prevails a body of popular sentient in favor of sports, why is not that fact a sufficient legitimation?",
  "25755": "And in what direction?",
  "25756": "Are you astonished?",
  "25757": "Surely there are not people there so ill?",
  "25758": "Are not these gifts worth the giving?",
  "25759": "What position do you hold now?",
  "25760": "Where, indeed?",
  "25761": "A horse?",
  "25762": "Is it not by bearing them in affectionate remembrance?",
  "25763": "But does not the resemblance you were speaking about just now strike the turnkeys?",
  "25764": "Can you describe him at all?",
  "25765": "Will one suffice?",
  "25766": "Who rains then?",
  "25767": "Would he send her any tidings of is return, or notice her in any way?",
  "25768": "Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?",
  "25769": "Why have they been keeping her?",
  "25770": "May we apply the word in speaking of the single steps made by the traveler as he advances?",
  "25771": "What can we do?",
  "25772": "How could they sustain the hard struggle for life unless by closely combining their forces?",
  "25773": "How do you live?",
  "25774": "But do we never find those virtues united which constitute a good man and excellent citizen?",
  "25775": "And you say that you have made certain conditions on my behalf?",
  "25776": "And did you preach?",
  "25777": "How dare you make a pretence of my commands, whilst I, full of just amazement, question you as to the cause of your appearance?",
  "25778": "Why put the posy in the cold dead hand?",
  "25779": "You are not off, then?",
  "25780": "Do you want to join, too?",
  "25781": "Would the removal prove fatal to him by causing some internal injury?",
  "25782": "Where to, sir?",
  "25783": "Genevieve?",
  "25784": "What, then, are you?",
  "25785": "Did she stay long there?",
  "25786": "What of the rat, then?",
  "25787": "An easy distance, do you call it?",
  "25788": "Dare you come with me?",
  "25789": "You are ill?",
  "25790": "Why not go in, dancing or no?",
  "25791": "My immortal soul?",
  "25792": "But for the sake of the mother?",
  "25793": "A misfortune for life?",
  "25794": "Give me back my bag, will you?",
  "25795": "Up to what moment did you see him beside you?",
  "25796": "Why are you doing this?",
  "25797": "To rob a man, to slay him, to make of him an exile and a wanderer on the face of the earth, are not these yet greater sins?",
  "25798": "May have bolted somewhere together?",
  "25799": "Doth she not with her smiling answer you?",
  "25800": "What do you sigh for?",
  "25801": "I gracious?",
  "25802": "You wish to speak with me alone, do you not?",
  "25803": "Would I?",
  "25804": "Gazetted?",
  "25805": "Nevertheless, you consent?",
  "25806": "What, did you refuse to dine with him?",
  "25807": "Will liberation make them any more numerous?",
  "25808": "Is he grateful, ma'am?",
  "25809": "But did not the king have you arrested immediately?",
  "25810": "Stand I to doubt, within the reach of fate?",
  "25811": "No, really?",
  "25812": "Would you please to go and look at him?",
  "25813": "What's the good of that?",
  "25814": "In my own house?",
  "25815": "Who has decked the heavenly firmament with its lights?",
  "25816": "What is its principle, its character, its formula?",
  "25817": "Were my gray hairs reserved for such intolerable disgrace?",
  "25818": "Is not this as if the treasury prevented cheapness?",
  "25819": "What are they coming in this direction for?",
  "25820": "So what better man to meet a duke than an archaeological president?",
  "25821": "Would you like me to try and swim across?",
  "25822": "But then how could this letter be trivial and grotesque, as describe by the son?",
  "25823": "Yes, how can you go alone at night like this?",

  "25825": "Has it?",
  "25826": "And what has she to do with it either way?",
  "25827": "Have republics in practice been less addicted to war than monarchies?",
  "25828": "You know which it is?",
  "25829": "And of individuals who consort with the mob and seek to please them?",

  "25862": "Is that good of me?",
  "25863": "Your sister is certainly better, certainly out of danger?",
  "25864": "When he chooses the labours which are proper, and makes them labour on them, who will repine?",
  "25865": "He said, what was it after all?",
  "25866": "Then he kept you from me, father, all those months, when you might have been here?",
  "25867": "Well, why should there be any more?",
  "25868": "Are you mad, my friend?",
  "25869": "Why not let him?",

  "25910": "What is her name?",
  "25911": "I ask any one who has adopted the calling of an engineer, how much time he lost when he left school, because he had to devote himself to pursuits which were absolutely novel and strange, and of which he had not obtained the remotest conception from his instructors?",
  "25912": "Ah, who says that we were not wise then?",
  "25913": "What on earth's the matter?",
  "25914": "Well, are you coming into my room?",
  "25915": "She poor?",

  "25949": "If this be so, as I believe it to be, why do you desire me to bend my will by force, for no other reason but that you say you love me?",
  "25950": "Or are you in the same mind?",
  "25951": "What have you been thinking about, my dear?",
  "25952": "Do you love your mother?",
  "25953": "Would you like to go in?",
  "25954": "For what could be of less importance, under the terrible circumstances which environed me, then the mere dimensions of my dungeon?",

  "25963": "But of what are you accused?",
  "25964": "Why so?",
  "25965": "Was it a great joy or a great misfortune that had befallen him?",
  "25966": "Was this all wrong?",
  "25967": "Is that all you wished to ask me?",
  "25968": "And if a necessary thing, how can it be dispensed with?",
  "25969": "With a letter?",
  "25970": "Because I lie with a queen?",

  "25976": "What, do we arrest our friends?",
  "25977": "And this beautiful and accomplished lady, she is not yet married?",
  "25978": "When do you say?",
  "25979": "Did you touch it?",
  "25980": "Will it ultimately reach the clear surface of my consciousness, this memory, this old, dead moment which the magnetism of an identical moment has travelled so far to importune, to disturb, to raise up out of the very depths of my being?",
  "25981": "Dandyism?",
  "25982": "What is a fray?",
  "25983": "Why is the crane so thin?",
  "25984": "Is it very important news?",
  "25985": "What on earth can she have gone there for?",
  "25986": "You'll do it, then?",
  "25987": "And the new system is one of your own invention?",

  "25989": "What have they taken a baby in there for?",
  "25990": "My wife came to your house to reclaim her father?",
  "25991": "Why, how can you be dissatisfied with yourself if you are happy?",
  "25992": "But what do you mean by the highest of all knowledge?",
  "25993": "Do you remember what I saw?",
  "25994": "Why should I do that?",
  "25995": "Do you think you are fit to touch the bed of a man like me?",
  "25996": "No, but what is it, my dear?",
  "25997": "But when a man is drawn in two opposite directions, to and from the same object, this, as we affirm, necessarily implies two distinct principles in him?",
  "25998": "Was he not of noble birth?",
  "25999": "What's the use of canting now?",

  "26008": "You will be ready, sir?",
  "26009": "Have you your papers?",
  "26010": "How many houses?",
  "26011": "Were you in the room at the moment of his fatal seizure?",
  "26012": "Whither should he go?",
  "26013": "Or, what encouragement is there left to continue throwing good money after bad?",
  "26014": "Yes, how do you know it?",
  "26015": "May not this affectation of a false stoicism come from the same source as his recognition of the right of property?",
  "26016": "Why does not he go about his business?",
  "26017": "Said I not from the first it would be so?",
  "26018": "And who conceals them?",
  "26019": "Her lord it was whom I wounded mortally, and yet do I think I can be reconciled with her?",
  "26020": "Do you wish it known that you are interested about him, monsieur le comte?",
  "26021": "What qualities are there for which a man gets so speedy a return of applause, as those of bodily superiority, activity, and valour?",
  "26022": "Can it be we are going into battle?",
  "26023": "Can anything be done for you?",
  "26024": "Could you put me up tonight?",
  "26025": "Has not life other motives as strong?",
  "26026": "Then, worn out by deceit, treasons, infidelity, and the whole body of terrestrial misery, what does he find at the end of his career?",
  "26027": "Have I got all my traps?",
  "26028": "What did you do then?",
  "26029": "Was she dreaming?",
  "26030": "And particularly, whether they were ever admitted as members in the lower senate?",

  "26032": "And what was that, shipmates?",
  "26033": "Did the archdeacon wink, or did he not?",
  "26034": "Of what tongue, from what land were they?",
  "26035": "Your profession?",
  "26036": "He is still with you, I presume?",
  "26037": "Now, where are you going?",
  "26038": "How can we trust one who lives by the fluctuating favour of a distant authority?",
  "26039": "Whither goes she?",
  "26040": "What had happened to him?",
  "26041": "Are we friends?",
  "26042": "Electric?",
  "26043": "What does your brother say?",
  "26044": "What is this water, and where does it run?",
  "26045": "But, unscrew your navel, and what's the consequence?",
  "26046": "You often think you know me as I really am?",
  "26047": "But where am I wandering to?",
  "26048": "Was the other one lost by a whale?",
  "26049": "One on each side of the ship?",
  "26050": "And is the record yours?",
  "26051": "Where could they be?",
  "26052": "Ah, now, what do you take me for?",
  "26053": "Can not it?",
  "26054": "Are these to be or not to be the strains which the children will hear repeated in their ears by all the citizens about those who are intimated to them to be their parents and the rest of their kinsfolk?",
  "26055": "For a hunt and a gallop, eh?",
  "26056": "And why are you permitted to go at large, unwatched?",
  "26057": "Anne, what want you here?",
  "26058": "Dravot used to make us laugh in the evenings when all the people was cooking their dinners—cooking their dinners, and … what did they do then?",
  "26059": "But what is he, I dinno?",
  "26060": "Is this quite certain?",
  "26061": "Where is he hiding?",
  "26062": "You dare to talk of your child?",
  "26063": "Can you not give me that information here?",
  "26064": "How say you, cousin?",
  "26065": "Are you sure?",
  "26066": "Why, that way?",
  "26067": "Have you put the lunch in?",
  "26068": "How then had he been able to explain, and in such language, the number of things that he could not have said so well before?",
  "26069": "What, is it right?",
  "26070": "Well, and how do you do?",
  "26071": "And the king?",
  "26072": "Am I not already in the grave?",
  "26073": "What shall I say to him first?",
  "26074": "What promise?",
  "26075": "And will he talk thus of affairs in presence of two strangers?",
  "26076": "What would the issue of it be?",
  "26077": "And why?",
  "26078": "How long you been this way?",
  "26079": "But all this entails expense, and upon whom is this to fall?",
  "26080": "Is this the origin of the zodiacal light?",
  "26081": "Is the fracture recent?",
  "26082": "Now are you ready to tell, boys?",
  "26083": "I suppose you have a garage there?",
  "26084": "That would meet the situation?",
  "26085": "Was this well done, young gentleman?",
  "26086": "If he could see the projectile through the glass of his gigantic telescope, what would he think?",
  "26087": "Meaning what?",
  "26088": "What's the exact state of affairs as regards myself?",
  "26089": "Or you have overheard the servants talk?",
  "26090": "Tom, what's the matter with you?",
  "26091": "Who brought it into this room, then?",
  "26092": "Why do you wish you were dead?",
  "26093": "Why, what do I keep you for?",
  "26094": "And JIM?",
  "26095": "But, pray, what pretty neat damsel was with you?",
  "26096": "Just like one of the peasants, all day long?",
  "26097": "Little boy, what do you want?",
  "26098": "Where is there any water?",
  "26099": "How could I say such cruel things to her?",
  "26100": "I have caught you, have I?",
  "26101": "Yes, that's it, she means to elope with him, but what am I to do?",
  "26102": "Leave tonight?",
  "26103": "What would you throw out?",
  "26104": "What did the king say to you?",
  "26105": "Do you know me?",
  "26106": "What vessel is that?",
  "26107": "Or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected?",
  "26108": "Why are we there ?",
  "26109": "Not even me?",
  "26110": "Ah, ha, that's it, is it?",

  "26112": "Would he succeed in coming face to face with the girl he was seeking?",
  "26113": "Whatever do you mean?",
  "26114": "And what went wrong?",
  "26115": "Yes honey, but what's the matter with you, precious?",
  "26116": "Will not the capture of one army after another satisfy him, must all become prisoners?",
  "26117": "How will they get at it?",
  "26118": "Expenses paid, and a moderate screw?",
  "26119": "Was she expecting a visitor?",
  "26120": "Thinks I, what does it mean?",
  "26121": "Were's it gorn?",
  "26122": "How's that?",
  "26123": "Now you, sir, will you answer me or not?",
  "26124": "I take back the ring, after it has passed through the hands of that infamous creature?",
  "26125": "And what did he find?",
  "26126": "Is it sure promised?",
  "26127": "What is the trial for, when he is not here and will never return?",
  "26128": "What a shameful disorder in nature, is it not, to make war against women?",
  "26129": "Whereabouts will she be?",
  "26130": "Am I not your comrade?",
  "26131": "But, suppose we should rise up tomorrow and emancipate, who would educate these millions, and teach them how to use their freedom?",
  "26132": "And he has gone, you say?",
  "26133": "H'm, then you DO give him money?",
  "26134": "Is she, then, preparing for a stroke?",
  "26135": "It is midnight?",
  "26136": "Will you have them fetched back?",
  "26137": "With your family?",
  "26138": "But you have seen him?",
  "26139": "What do you think yourself?",
  "26140": "Had they actually existed?",
  "26141": "And your father was always kind?",
  "26142": "What does it signify?",
  "26143": "And what are you doing here?",
  "26144": "I wish to know your name?",
  "26145": "Is he a name for a syndicate?",
  "26146": "When did you do it?",
  "26147": "Which of them will you retain?",
  "26148": "And you are happy?",
  "26149": "Do you refer to her husband's proposal to give her back her own money?",
  "26150": "What holy text can be quoted to justify his assertion?",
  "26151": "Alive?",
  "26152": "And who on earth, after the daily experience we have, can question the probability of a gentleman marrying anybody?",
  "26153": "How did you get it?",
  "26154": "How do they call you?",
  "26155": "Do you know that you can buy one for less than your rent?",
  "26156": "Oh, has she, has she?",
  "26157": "Supposing someone should come out suddenly?",
  "26158": "Is it riches or physical beauty or noble birth?",
  "26159": "To what end?",
  "26160": "A spy?",
  "26161": "And does the soul admit of death?",
  "26162": "Is it peculiar to you, or is it common to woman?",
  "26163": "And who is your father?",
  "26164": "And is he unhappy?",
  "26165": "What does this mean?",
  "26166": "When shall I be back?",

  "26634": "What does it all mean?",
  "26635": "But when you leave him, for instance?",
  "26636": "Only slightly touched?",
  "26637": "Was it for so petty a thing that he had done all that he had done?",
  "26638": "Perhaps this incident was connected with that of the bullet?",

  "26833": "Can I come, with my doll?",
  "26834": "Yes my boy?",
  "26835": "Had it not been for this utter stranger, they had succeeded, for who would have accepted my unsupported word against the damning evidence of those cards hidden on my person?",
  "26836": "Why this man saved and that man lost?",
  "26837": "How has my judgment wander'd?",
  "26838": "And is not all true virtue the companion of wisdom, no matter what fears or pleasures or other similar goods or evils may or may not attend her?",
  "26839": "You know what I mean?",
  "26840": "What, sweetheart?",
  "26841": "What sort of a place is it?",
  "26842": "Well, I vow, that's what the sea folks call sailing UNDER BARE POLES, come true, aint it?",
  "26843": "Who took his hands out of mine?",
  "26844": "I insist upon your living, do you hear?",

  "26852": "But who is there that ever heard of such an instinct?",
  "26853": "Well, but what am I to do?",
  "26854": "Subdivide?",
  "26855": "What is the colour of the men?",
  "26856": "What's the pay?",

  "26901": "You are, I imagine, still of the same opinion?",
  "26902": "Or not you so much, perhaps, as your friend in the city?",
  "26903": "Did you ask her how much?",
  "26904": "Is there no force on this side of the creek?",
  "26905": "If I guess rightly, will you confess it?",
  "26906": "Ay, but how shall we know the catchpole?",
  "26907": "Why are there men and women that while they are nigh me the sunlight expands my blood?",
  "26908": "Why, according to popular belief is it rather characterised by the very contrary?",

  "26911": "Oh, what does that matter?",
  "26912": "What place was there in her mind for a remonstrance to lodge in?",
  "26913": "Really and truly?",
  "26914": "If that were so, what had become of my father?",
  "26915": "But where is the last year's snow?",
  "26916": "How much will you ask to stay with her till the end?",
  "26917": "Can the heart become misshapen and contract incurable deformities and infirmities under the oppression of a disproportionate unhappiness, as the vertebral column beneath too low a vault?",
  "26918": "What can it be?",
  "26919": "What was the sense of that?",
  "26920": "I felt very ignorant, but what could I do?",
  "26921": "And what are you going to do with yourself now, if I may ask?",
  "26922": "What interest of hers was affected by the treaty?",
  "26923": "An order to who?",
  "26924": "Which is the stronger, the small stick that first PRODUCES the fire, or the fire itself?",
  "26925": "So you've been at the club?",

  "26927": "Do you think not?",
  "26928": "What you mought call me?",
  "26929": "Full of hope?",
  "26930": "And who will go?",
  "26931": "Farther?",
  "26932": "Should he slip away after having come and peeped into the barricade?",
  "26933": "Perhaps?",
  "26934": "Very well, my dear sir, and how does that concern us?",
  "26935": "But will the wild ass submit to the bonds?",

  "26945": "Is it really so that I may understand you, sir?",
  "26946": "Well, dad, what do you say about it?",
  "26947": "Why did she love everything so tenderly and so passionately, everything living that was not a man?",
  "26948": "In favor of some member of your family?",
  "26949": "You are angry, monsieur?",
  "26950": "What, he told you so, I suppose?",
  "26951": "What, have they buried him in honour for his services to them?",
  "26952": "To stand from fear set free?",
  "26953": "You are aware, I suppose, that all mythology and poetry is a narration of events, either past, present, or to come?",
  "26954": "Why do you go, sir?",
  "26955": "This DETOUR has been entirely for our benefit, then?",
  "26956": "What do you tell me?",
  "26957": "What was she like now?",
  "26958": "Call the captain, and heave the ship aback?",
  "26959": "And did you observe any change in her then?",
  "26960": "Flee alone, and leave you here?",
  "26961": "Can I have lost it?",
  "26962": "But what makes you so much out of sorts?",
  "26963": "Why, wherefore stay you?",
  "26964": "Who asked him while I was away?",
  "26965": "Jarndyce?",
  "26966": "What does it depend upon?",
  "26967": "Now will you learn not to answer back when I speak to you?",
  "26968": "And what you think of it?",
  "26969": "But, on the other hand, did not the people evince decided obstinacy and insubordination?",
  "26970": "And my making it easy for you to see the child?",
  "26971": "Has anyone an interest in preventing your arrival there?",
  "26972": "Do you abuse your teacher?",
  "26973": "Has it struck you that we may not now choose to give over?",
  "26974": "And how do you like the place?",
  "26975": "Why do you not sit by his side and begin talking to him and asking him questions?",
  "26976": "What have you got to be afraid of?",
  "26977": "What used he to say?",
  "26978": "Where the devil is mine?",
  "26979": "That millions of others still exist, which are too minute for any observation?",
  "26980": "I suppose we might call her that?",
  "26981": "What's that to me?",
  "26982": "But you are sure you can act your part, and disguise your voice so that he may mistake that, as he has already mistaken your person?",
  "26983": "What would it matter if you smashed to smithereens at the end of the run, after a bust like that?",
  "26984": "Can someone have guessed our secret and dug up the watch?",
  "26985": "But what could he do but just let her see that he would make anything, everything, for her, as honourably easy as possible?",
  "26986": "How many cartridges did you say you had left?",
  "26987": "What then is worth being valued?",
  "26988": "What does this avail?",
  "26989": "This, then, was his father's residence?",

  "27384": "After several questions relative to my faith, situation, and family, he asked me bluntly if my mother was damned?",
  "27385": "They had lost twenty years, but what had they gained?",
  "27386": "Why did I not die?",
  "27387": "Does the man generally sleep like this?",
  "27388": "What can I do better in the interval between this and the setting of the sun?",
  "27389": "Do personal relations lead to sloppiness in the end?",
  "27390": "And you, being a good man, can pass it as such, and forgive and pity the dreamer, and be lenient and encouraging when he wakes?",
  "27391": "What means the woman?",
  "27392": "But what are your intentions?",
  "27393": "But about the time when he should drive the cattle homewards, who should he see coming but a great giant with his sword in his hand?",
  "27394": "How did she die?",
  "27395": "Who did the modern wisdom begin now, and no sooner?",
  "27396": "Am I afraid to look it straight in the face?",
  "27397": "If it is useful, are the individuals who rule the country richer?",
  "27398": "How long?",
  "27399": "Do you not see some loophole, some flaw?",
  "27400": "Is it a bitter dose?",
  "27401": "Was it not on my account that she wished to be laid to rest in this place?",
  "27402": "Would you be a porter?",
  "27403": "Who is this in whom such beauty is radiant?",
  "27404": "But who was your mother?",
  "27405": "What has she left behind her?",
  "27406": "And democracy has her own good, of which the insatiable desire brings her to dissolution?",
  "27407": "Lady, what condition is that?",
  "27408": "How could he run away with the child in his arms?",
  "27409": "Are not ten hours enough for tuition?",
  "27410": "Doubt what?",
  "27411": "But what had been the incidents of this terrible war?",
  "27412": "Can you not clear up the last point in this mystery, and tell us the reasons for your action?",
  "27413": "We have made the circuit of our satellite, then?",
  "27414": "Monsieur is jealous, is he not, sister?",
  "27415": "But, I ask, what is meant by contingent?",
  "27416": "Was it their colours?",
  "27417": "Chaw?",
  "27418": "Why did she not take out her ships and insist on going with him?",
  "27419": "How do you get in?",
  "27420": "What am I to work for when my work is no use to anybody?",
  "27421": "What are the glowing fancies of the sky?",
  "27422": "Did I not give you a sufficient account of the elements' transmutation, and the blunders that are made of roast for boiled, and boiled for roast?",
  "27423": "What was there about them to confound me in this manner?",
  "27424": "Which is the easiest and most practicable plan, RECONCILIATION OR INDEPENDANCE?",
  "27425": "Is he a poor creature then, as he does nothing for the public good?",
  "27426": "How has all that been done?",
  "27427": "When is the next rehearsal?",
  "27428": "What has been the matter?",
  "27429": "Where's the flax?",
  "27430": "And what shall we make of him, now we've got him?",
  "27431": "But why does anyone object to his being a dirty fellow?",
  "27432": "To be probable?",
  "27433": "Why, then, do you interest yourself for this young lady, if you did not know her?",
  "27434": "What know you of this man?",
  "27435": "What ails you?",
  "27436": "But who can he be?",
  "27437": "What the devil is this?",
  "27438": "Come here girl, and tell me on what day you were born?",
  "27439": "Should we ever know anything about its opposite shores?",
  "27440": "Then you have seen him?",
  "27441": "Come, how shall we decide?",
  "27442": "To be driven from our village, and our hunting grounds, and not even to be permitted to visit the graves of our forefathers and relatives and our friends?",
  "27443": "What is the primary cause of intellectual degeneracy and, as we shall show continually, civilized misery?",
  "27444": "Where do we go to?",
  "27445": "Then how many are there?",
  "27446": "And why care for those who do not know you?",
  "27447": "Do you call the whole reckoning?",
  "27448": "Where was the clue?",
  "27449": "What should they do?",
  "27450": "What does it know about government?",
  "27451": "Had the inhabitants fled into the interior?",
  "27452": "What shall we do when daylight comes?",
  "27453": "Yet what happened?",
  "27454": "You did not think of opening your door and looking out into the gallery?",
  "27455": "How could she run so fast?",
  "27456": "Have I changed much since then?",
  "27457": "Why does not every collection of fossil remains afford plain evidence of the gradation and mutation of the forms of life?",
  "27458": "Less guarded and more trustful?",
  "27459": "You would not have known me, would you?",
  "27460": "What, then, did it all amount to?",
  "27461": "An enemy?",
  "27462": "Do you look out often?",
  "27463": "You will find him?",
  "27464": "Of me?",
  "27465": "There will be no difficulty in loading up the mules, will there?",
  "27466": "And will you direct us?",
  "27467": "And not in the same hand, perhaps?",
  "27468": "D'Artagnan here?",
  "27469": "Why, I said, do you not see that men are unwillingly deprived of good, and willingly of evil?",
  "27470": "Yet what was this liberty?",
  "27471": "What do you say, shall we go and look for mushrooms today?",
  "27472": "Have you paper there?",
  "27473": "Rich?",
  "27474": "Oh, did you?",
  "27475": "And for your sons?",
  "27476": "Shall not I be a cuckold?",
  "27477": "Whose fault was it?",
  "27478": "Who's interfering with which?",
  "27479": "He certainly likes the child, but will he love me less as his affection grows for her?",
  "27480": "What odds, dear boy?",
  "27481": "What order could be maintained?",
  "27482": "But would you wish your vengeance to do you harm instead of good?",
  "27483": "When there were no people in the bungalow, did we have any mongoose in the garden?",
  "27484": "What are all those good people laughing at over there?",
  "27485": "To arrest you?",
  "27486": "The singers?",
  "27487": "And if it were so, would it be possible to make others so believe?",
  "27488": "But property on what condition?",
  "27489": "But has she made you any less discontented with me?",
  "27490": "When's the wedding to be?",
  "27491": "Have you noticed his clothes?",
  "27492": "Has the moon been inhabited?",
  "27493": "You find it too much for you?",
  "27494": "Well, and how shall I receive him?",
  "27495": "What else can we do, what in all the world else?",
  "27496": "You, gentle brother, forged this for my sake?",
  "27497": "What's a bar sinister?",
  "27498": "What says it?",
  "27499": "I beg your pardon, sir, but I think those gentlemen are military?",
  "27500": "Should I tell him or should I not tell him?",
  "27501": "And who stands safest?",
  "27502": "Lieutenant?",
  "27503": "A sailor, I believe?",
  "27504": "What was the difference between that gallant that's gone and you, sir?",
  "27505": "Are you quite sure of that?",
  "27506": "How can you bear to speak so lightly?",
  "27507": "Not even got a pencil on you?",
  "27508": "Where, for instance?",
  "27509": "Well, what did he do?",
  "27510": "Why should a man hold a match to the side of his pipe?",
  "27511": "And there it ended?",
  "27512": "Why must I be kept forever muffled up in a scarf and padded boots?",
  "27513": "What in creation made you call him a thief?",
  "27514": "That village a few miles off?",
  "27515": "But why do I not find this rest for this weary heart?",
  "27516": "What are you thinking about?",
  "27517": "How would wild horses drag a secret from a person anyhow?",
  "27518": "But what is the use of it?",
  "27519": "And did he go?",
  "27520": "Is there no way by which I can get it?",
  "27521": "And if any, what?",
  "27522": "Carstone?",
  "27523": "Do you know how to stitch caps?",
  "27524": "And all only for sport?",
  "27525": "Why are we perverse and ask for something else?",
  "27526": "And did he think amiss?",
  "27527": "Is he stupid?",
  "27528": "Was it to end with me?",
  "27529": "What faculty?",
  "27530": "I hope, prince, that you are too progressive to deny this?",
  "27531": "Zaccone?",
  "27532": "What became of you?",
  "27533": "O why?",
  "27534": "Shall we slay him with our pikes?",
  "27535": "A wedding?",
  "27536": "Deserted you?",
  "27537": "Can any here give a name to such a cry?",
  "27538": "What means this outrage?",
  "27539": "Have you been enjoying yourself?",
  "27540": "When one will have defeated the other, of whom can he complain who has the worst of it?",
  "27541": "By the by, my dear friend, do you not think it would have puzzled these ancient dogmaticians to have determined by which of their two roads it was that the most important and most sublime of all their truths was, in effect, attained?",
  "27542": "Then whom, ARE you talking about?",
  "27543": "You mean that this demands explanation, do you not?",
  "27544": "Can it be a song of joy?",
  "27545": "Did it move, did it float on the surface of the ocean, or did it dive into its depths?",
  "27546": "Reasonable well, I give you thanks, wont you alight?",
  "27547": "Do the gentlemen say so?",
  "27548": "Beasts, did you say?",
  "27549": "Who is coming to tea?",
  "27550": "Put an end?",
  "27551": "How can I tell him to be sober when I have been a beast all my life?",
  "27552": "If free, would he attempt to fly, or would he remain?",
  "27553": "They're not far from here, then?",
  "27554": "Were you a steward or a stoker in those days?",
  "27555": "Is it true that force and right are necessarily on the same side in republican governments?",
  "27556": "Are you aware how small his means are, and of the straitened circumstances of his widow?",
  "27557": "My own?",
  "27558": "It was to meet him here that you came?",
  "27559": "Had he not cause for triumph?",
  "27560": "Will you hear me?",
  "27561": "Never more to be separated?",
  "27562": "What disguise do you propose to adopt?",
  "27563": "How was that managed?",
  "27564": "Is it not so, my friends?",
  "27565": "And he has accepted the call?",
  "27566": "What name go you by?",
  "27567": "And what truth?",
  "27568": "Yes, where is this letter?",
  "27569": "Where away, cook?",
  "27570": "And with regard to the past?",
  "27571": "A deanery for her brother in the church?",
  "27572": "What shall we have, said he, to drink in these deserts?",
  "27573": "Is there any collective action which cannot find its justification in political unity, in patriotism, in the balance of power, or in civilization?",
  "27574": "Lady, when was it that your heart was there?",
  "27575": "Where is humanity?",
  "27576": "Where did he live, then?",
  "27577": "What have I done?",
  "27578": "Whom do you wish to speak about?",
  "27579": "You remain near this part?",
  "27580": "Pray what is your own theory as to what took place?",
  "27581": "What?",
  "27582": "She would smile on me, she would say a word to me, would that do any harm to any one?",
  "27583": "What origin do they attribute to these rifts?",
  "27584": "Do you think I am not grateful?",
  "27585": "WHAT did you see her doing?",
  "27586": "Under these circumstances, was it perfectly certain that no danger could accrue?",
  "27587": "Why should society work out an extraordinary system of rewards for those whom it is already rewarding automatically?",
  "27588": "If, secondly, the question is asked whether this being is substance, whether it is of the greatest reality, whether it is necessary, and so forth?",
  "27589": "How could I wait so long?",
  "27590": "Well, have I convinced you?",
  "27591": "Oh, where am I to go?",
  "27592": "And if they were pleased, would that make them immortal?",
  "27593": "What do they say to this?",
  "27594": "What design has the cardinal upon you to make him so generous?",
  "27595": "Is it indeed so?",
  "27596": "How came you to be walking here?",
  "27597": "There is the other service, the old one, that which belonged to my husband?",
  "27598": "A room just above?",
  "27599": "Will their successors falter and plead organic impotency in the nation?",
  "27600": "Now what do you think?",
  "27601": "It is in my power, think you, to make such a change at demand?",
  "27602": "It will have pity?",
  "27603": "What can I propose?",
  "27604": "Should I not be disingenuously serving my own ends?",
  "27605": "Do you recall him?",
  "27606": "Landlords?",
  "27607": "Should they ever again find themselves in the midst of their friends, or seated at the domestic hearth?",
  "27608": "To lead me to my death, is that enough?",
  "27609": "What use am I to make of your instruction?",
  "27610": "Where?",
  "27611": "Shall we, then, establish it for a general maxim, that no refined or elaborate reasoning is ever to be received?",
  "27612": "How did you get such big big hips?",
  "27613": "How about me?",
  "27614": "Oh?",
  "27615": "Is it deemed a holy place in the land, then?",
  "27616": "The king has not signed, however?",
  "27617": "Why the delay of a reargument?",
  "27618": "But how do you know?",
  "27619": "But if he did marry her in spite of the threat?",
  "27620": "Did I say a peach?",
  "27621": "What has happened since then to give you a completely new idea of the case?",
  "27622": "Has a young man, such as I am, gone through this morning, then?",
  "27623": "What am I to say, indoors?",
  "27624": "How did he evolve his ethics?",
  "27625": "Do virtuous men, in so far as they are virtuous, stand in each other's light?",
  "27626": "And is no allowance to be made for inadvertence, or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment?",
  "27627": "Or is it actual?",
  "27628": "How does she look?",
  "27629": "Married another?",
  "27630": "And what may his name be, coptain?",
  "27631": "You might have stayed away, I suppose, if you would?",
  "27632": "Brown, convicted of mutinous conduct and sentenced to death?",
  "27633": "Who will become the sharer of this dangerous secret?",
  "27634": "What is the gift of conquest but safety?",
  "27635": "French, eh?",
  "27636": "Is he too so very remarkable?",
  "27637": "Who do you think is going to be married tomorrow?",
  "27638": "Both, on the other hand, had joined pretty gaily in the conversation, for why should they interrupt it?",
  "27639": "I regulate my watch?",
  "27640": "Do you hear, sir?",
  "27641": "How can girls like to have lovers and refuse them?",
  "27642": "Have you finished tea?",
  "27643": "What like was she?",
  "27644": "Has anything extraordinary happened to you?",
  "27645": "Who made this gruel here?",
  "27646": "And where are they?",
  "27647": "If you had been born such, would you have been here now?",
  "27648": "But how do you come here?",
  "27649": "But I wonder is it so very nice?",
  "27650": "Did it hurt you much?",
  "27651": "On what principle, then, shall we any longer choose justice rather than the worst injustice?",
  "27652": "What do I read here?",
  "27653": "What woman can before her husband?",
  "27654": "Who has the right to dictate to my conscience, and where did he get that right?",
  "27655": "Is she coming, and open, free?",
  "27656": "By your orders?",
  "27657": "To dig the foundations out from under that cabin with?",
  "27658": "My dear child, how can I help minding?",
  "27659": "Is this so?",
  "27660": "You'll make up for it by making another?",
  "27661": "Bubbles?",
  "27662": "Are you willing to endure to the last, and not once attempt a repayment?",
  "27663": "What are they, my dear friend?",
  "27664": "I hope you think so?",
  "27665": "But why on earth should it bother him?",
  "27666": "I wonder whether I've done well in advising that amusement?",
  "27667": "Jack?",
  "27668": "What means can I take to introduce it to the world?",
  "27669": "And so it came about that the young rat did see a good deal of the world, but how?",
  "27670": "But they will contest the will after your death?",
  "27671": "Walks by night, does she?",
  "27672": "Is that enough?",
  "27673": "What about souls?",
  "27674": "But what have you been doing?",
  "27675": "Do we need common sense and fairness in our regulations?",
  "27676": "Oh, who does not desire to dwell forever and forever in that city of love and light when the pains and sorrows, the trials and tears, of this weary life are over?",
  "27677": "Ought we to rank this one species with bears, and what should we do with the other species?",
  "27678": "Were you not engaged in it then?",
  "27679": "How do you know that, sir?",
  "27680": "Is it conscious?",
  "27681": "What do you know on the subject?",
  "27682": "And what, pray, is your idea of the duties of a devoted friend?",
  "27683": "Who can desire it more than I?",
  "27684": "What would you propose doing?",
  "27685": "What chance have I?",
  "27686": "What were his charms?",
  "27687": "Why should they not work for a uniform minimum of labour conditions through all their communities?",
  "27688": "So he has turned you out?",
  "27689": "Come for long?",
  "27690": "By the way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from?",
  "27691": "Why should he be so mean now?",
  "27692": "DO with it?",
  "27693": "Ask you what provocation I have had?",
  "27694": "Not know the thing which my own eyes beheld?",
  "27695": "Will you taste for yourself?",
  "27696": "It's not a very nice night to be out, is it?",
  "27697": "You'll come and meet me as usual, girls?",
  "27698": "Now, had I come upon a hopeless incompatibility?",
  "27699": "Quite a vineyard, hey?",
  "27700": "Have I done right?",
  "27701": "He's all right?",
  "27702": "Ought we not to make something great out of a youth, under twenty, who has, in the highest degree, quickness to conceive and courage to execute?",
  "27703": "Was there no loophole of escape?",
  "27704": "I suppose we must take the shapes of beasts?",
  "27705": "What are you surprised at?",
  "27706": "What did they matter when he played divinely?",
  "27707": "Tell me the why of this?",
  "27708": "But is it that makes you go?",
  "27709": "Will you graciously let me kiss your hand?",
  "27710": "Who are you to ask me my business?",
  "27711": "But does not this question make a disturbance outside of political circles?",
  "27712": "What influence can I possibly have over a bandit?",
  "27713": "Is there a carriage at the door?",
  "27714": "Do you still wish to do so?",
  "27715": "At all events, what use was there in delaying?",
  "27716": "And what right had she to be cross?",
  "27717": "What's the good, if you're sick with love for him?",
  "27718": "How should you?",
  "27719": "Is that fine, keen edge upon your soul that gives such avidity for holy things?",
  "27720": "What of the resemblance?",
  "27721": "Why a locksmiths' association in a village?",
  "27722": "Or must I fly the country altogether?",
  "27723": "What would have been the result?",
  "27724": "Back at last?",
  "27725": "What else could this fragment be but the sole surviving remnant of some sumptuous mansion that once had stood on this unrivaled site?",
  "27726": "In relation to what objects?",
  "27727": "You WERE afraid?",
  "27728": "Do you think I am deceiving you?",
  "27729": "How can you know what he is?",
  "27730": "What were you eating there all by yourself for your dinner?",
  "27731": "Are you going to sail in?",
  "27732": "Wonder if you'll ever drag me up there?",
  "27733": "Is there any need to hurry, sir?",
  "27734": "Still I ask you, what is this to me?",
  "27735": "And leave the litter as it is?",
  "27736": "Do you advance with him?",
  "27737": "So perhaps I shall rub on?",
  "27738": "In front or behind?",
  "27739": "And by what authority?",
  "27740": "Yea, what then?",
  "27741": "I really could not say?",
  "27742": "And does he imagine that the coadjutor will put himself out for him?",
  "27743": "Do you think she will ever forget that her son is her safeguard, her shield, the pledge for her dignity, for her fortune and her life?",
  "27744": "You said prince, did you not?",
  "27745": "Was it worth it?",
  "27746": "Shall we turn back?",
  "27747": "At the end of your name stands for?",
  "27748": "Is it not time to decide finally the meaning of the gift of the great fortune now all in your hand, and growing?",
  "27749": "Well, are we going to stand here all day?",
  "27750": "Who would not acknowledge that a poor man or woman, fain to earn daily bread by the sweat of the brow, is far more reprehensible in yielding to the solicitations of love, than a rich lady, whose life is lapped in ease and unrestricted luxury?",
  "27751": "Have we reached the limits of what reason can supply?",
  "27752": "What should I say?",
  "27753": "Did you ever, O king, hear a cat purring over a bowl of broth, or the buzzing of beetles in the twilight, or a shrill tongued old woman scolding your head off?",
  "27754": "What will gladden your heart?",
  "27755": "Are you sure it will be the last time?",
  "27756": "What is that for a man to do?",
  "27757": "Since when?",
  "27758": "Why, soldiers, why?",
  "27759": "How came you to read some of those queerer ones?",
  "27760": "Did you not love your husband either?",
  "27761": "Where is true peace or true glory?",
  "27762": "How is it now?",
  "27763": "Durys?",
  "27764": "Has the reality of them ever been perceived by you through the bodily organs?",
  "27765": "Which girls should love?",
  "27766": "When was it?",
  "27767": "Did you hit her?",
  "27768": "Is there any signal for the general rally?",
  "27769": "About what age is he?",
  "27770": "And why did I come here?",
  "27771": "What mercy can you expect from the man whom you have wronged?",
  "27772": "Have I taken an oath of some sort, then?",
  "27773": "Shall we say, in such a case, that the will of the majority was for the ultimate end?",
  "27774": "You say?",
  "27775": "Do you no longer like to think of your mother?",
  "27776": "What are you doing?",
  "27777": "Why then should a man cling to a longer stay here?",
  "27778": "The symptoms are marked, do you see?",
  "27779": "Whether fate, whose circle surrounds us, exercises a control over our liberty so imperious and compulsory that infractions of the law, committed under the dominion of antinomies, cease to be imputable to us?",
  "27780": "But supposing we had the authority, I would ask what good can result from the examination?",
  "27781": "What am I coming for?",
  "27782": "But settled?",
  "27783": "Did I like his voice?",
  "27784": "How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor?",
  "27785": "Who to?",
  "27786": "And the girl?",
  "27787": "Well, have you had a good hunt, have you botanised successfully?",
  "27788": "And why should you want to spite her?",
  "27789": "What did you pick me up for?",
  "27790": "Have you ever seen it?",
  "27791": "When, then, did father and son exchange shields, and why?",
  "27792": "Would he have been justified in sacrificing his own child, even if he could thereby save another's?",
  "27793": "Why are you only laying one place?",
  "27794": "Loves him?",
  "27795": "Yet who are the folk whom you find HERE?",
  "27796": "Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?",
  "27797": "Who is coming in here?",
  "27798": "What was she going to say, and what reply would she get?",
  "27799": "Can you tell me how to go about getting on the stage?",
  "27800": "What was your idea, then?",
  "27801": "Running from what?",
  "27802": "Valdemar?",
  "27803": "How are you going to manage to get out?",
  "27804": "Have you a portmanteau?",
  "27805": "What does it matter?",
  "27806": "What depth have we now reached?",
  "27807": "What the deuse do we men go to school for?",
  "27808": "If it be called swamp or sky?",
  "27809": "How the devil is he so like?",
  "27810": "Once more, will you undertake it?",
  "27811": "Are not these functions proper to the soul, and can they rightly be assigned to any other?",
  "27812": "How's this, dear niece?",
  "27813": "Do you know who that was?",
  "27814": "Was SHE at the ball too?",
  "27815": "And what made you ask it of me?",
  "27816": "Do you know that if we should ship, it would serve you quite right?",
  "27817": "Where are your wits?",
  "27818": "Is it possible, dear, that what I hear is true?",
  "27819": "No clue?",
  "27820": "Will you give me as far from the river as you can distinguish the belly of a horse?",
  "27821": "So what if he died, how did this concern the boy?",
  "27822": "Build I in the winds my dwelling?",
  "27823": "And what more free than he that desireth nothing upon earth?",
  "27824": "And you have them?",
  "27825": "And are greater miracles to be performed by those who do not follow his footsteps, who healed the body to reach the mind?",
  "27826": "And did I say there was any difficulty?",
  "27827": "Have I not got a brave determination of all my doubts, and a response in all things agreeable to the oracle that gave it?",
  "27828": "Could I leave the lady alone?",
  "27829": "Do you think I'm not sufficiently ruining my health living here amid the continual emanations of the pharmacy?",
  "27830": "How should she be able to compose herself when she should first see him?",
  "27831": "But tell me, what would you have done?",
  "27832": "Confused?",
  "27833": "Wherefrom do they acquire these tendencies, these peculiarities?",
  "27834": "Who first seduced them to that foul revolt?",
  "27835": "If they want to jump down, now, and get into trouble, who objects?",
  "27836": "Do you regard that meaning as offensive?",
  "27837": "And why does the former operation end exactly when the latter commences?",
  "27838": "What is your notion?",
  "27839": "What now was my plain duty?",
  "27840": "And how were they?",
  "27841": "Who told you his name?",
  "27842": "Shall we then raise cuckolds?",
  "27843": "But that I make no admissions?",
  "27844": "Am I deceived?",
  "27845": "What's the good of daylight now?",
  "27846": "Does any man ask himself what profit he has gained from the fulfilment of his dreams, if he must still endure, still undergo hunger and thirst and toil and trouble and care?",
  "27847": "What are the facts?",
  "27848": "Have you nothing to say to us?",
  "27849": "Can you tell when there is a good fire?",
  "27850": "What on earth will she say to me, I wonder?",
  "27851": "Did you anticipate the accident which has happened to your granddaughter?",
  "27852": "What cause had you to make discoveries of his pretended passion?",
  "27853": "Elopement?",
  "27854": "How shall I be able to endure life for thirteen years?",
  "27855": "How deeply sir, you apprehend it?",
  "27856": "Cake or bread and butter?",
  "27857": "Or might you have only travelled for your amusement?",
  "27858": "Who has not seen poor birds caught by their feet in the lime?",
  "27859": "Does not the practice of despoiling an enemy afford an excuse for not facing the battle?",
  "27860": "The place is then, as you know, determined on rebellion?",
  "27861": "And was that the upshot of my life's hardest battle?",
  "27862": "When did you shed tears over lost souls?",
  "27863": "Is it not horrible?",
  "27864": "On plantation?",
  "27865": "When you say it that way it sounds comical, does it not?",
  "27866": "What did you do with the girl?",
  "27867": "Who would want to injure us, or damage the projectile?",
  "27868": "How do you distinguish them?",
  "27869": "Haidee, would it please you not to leave me?",
  "27870": "In the name of the ninth day, what manner of creature are you?",
  "27871": "It is then a service which you propose to render us, count?",
  "27872": "Why a blue coat?",
  "27873": "Are you here for good?",
  "27874": "What was I telling you?",
  "27875": "Snakes?",
  "27876": "Ought she to shrink in this way from the long penance of life, which was all the possibility she had of lightening the load to some other sufferers, and so changing that passionate error into a new force of unselfish human love?",
  "27877": "May I ask you a question?",
  "27878": "And yet does not your honor fear to compromise yourself by allowing such a sum to be carried away for the service of your enemy?",
  "27879": "Then have we got to part?",
  "27880": "But what do you want to do with these chickens?",
  "27881": "Do you suggest that I should do that to a similarly garbed female?",
  "27882": "What is going on here?",
  "27883": "Can I see her first?",
  "27884": "And the profits are large?",
  "27885": "You let him go?",
  "27886": "How can he save them?",
  "27887": "All right, is it?",
  "27888": "Is that the sort of fellow?",
  "27889": "And that's all you want?",
  "27890": "Well, now, when you orators get that off next year, and, may be, this very year, how would you like some old grizzled farmer to get up in the grove and deny it?",
  "27891": "Fluffed in his lines, did he?",
  "27892": "But was resistance and, in the last place, victory possible?",
  "27893": "Ought not a son to love his father, whatever happens?",
  "27894": "Why, you wished to have a talk with me when the others left?",
  "27895": "Have you ever heard anything particular respecting his birth?",
  "27896": "But how did we become engaged?",
  "27897": "Did this man belong to the double enigma of order and disorder?",
  "27898": "Then he has travelled?",
  "27899": "Will you not take my word?",
  "27900": "I pray you say, what would you ask?",
  "27901": "What is the name of this obliging youth?",
  "27902": "Have they sentenced you?",
  "27903": "I am the ghost's accomplice?",
  "27904": "And has not this been our own case in the matter of equals and of absolute equality?",
  "27905": "And if I do my duty and do right, you will sustain me, will you not?",
  "27906": "Do not you also?",
  "27907": "And yet they say that war is like a game of chess?",
  "27908": "But what does he want of them?",
  "27909": "But what's your real name?",
  "27910": "Then why did you stay with us, and blast your prospects?",
  "27911": "And the salary?",
  "27912": "Have you heard the news, sir?",
  "27913": "Or to what port are we bound?",
  "27914": "Why, then, is it, when neither law nor justice forbids it, that we are asked to spend our time and money in inquiring into its truth?",
  "27915": "And what will all her learning and her daintiness do for her, now?",
  "27916": "How has this terrible past been recalled?",
  "27917": "Am I to feed upon wisdom like a dog?",
  "27918": "Indeed, why not?",
  "27919": "Could not you, sir, estimate their maximum?",
  "27920": "Is this the fact?",
  "27921": "Barsad?",
  "27922": "And our poor cactuses, where are they?",
  "27923": "What muscles he had?",
  "27924": "No, but what can I do?",
  "27925": "Have they allowed the headsman to escape?",
  "27926": "Is perseverance a virtue?",
  "27927": "Can you ever forgive me?",
  "27928": "You really think that your solution must be correct?",
  "27929": "Have we not already seen enough of the fallacy and extravagance of those idle theories which have amused us with promises of an exemption from the imperfections, weaknesses and evils incident to society in every shape?",
  "27930": "You have nothing further to say to me?",
  "27931": "Shall I cut away?",
  "27932": "Now, what's up?",
  "27933": "PISTHETAERUS I?",
  "27934": "Is there anything you dislike in me that you act so contrarily to my wishes?",
  "27935": "Anger?",
  "27936": "Is it not some bad affair?",
  "27937": "I wonder how many I shall meet going back?",
  "27938": "Could it be possible that they had escaped?",
  "27939": "Had he any weapons?",
  "27940": "Was there no way by which I might have enjoyed in freedom comforts even greater than those which I now earn by servitude?",
  "27941": "What is spirit?",
  "27942": "Then why were you taught to shoot?",
  "27943": "What good comes of it?",
  "27944": "What happened to me?",
  "27945": "What was it that set our two hearts eternally apart and made hope impossible?",
  "27946": "The captain?",
  "27947": "Ruinous, why?",
  "27948": "Was she really a stenographer?",
  "27949": "Is it possible that he died in the bitter frame of mind he was then in?",
  "27950": "And what do you reckon your outfit will cost?",
  "27951": "Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?",
  "27952": "But, by the holy city, why does he make me pay for what anybody else could have for nothing?",
  "27953": "What did he talk about?",
  "27954": "Who was it you were talking with over there?",
  "27955": "You have a chamber?",
  "27956": "What was I doing with the lady?",
  "27957": "What did they understand by it?",
  "27958": "What does he wish to gain by it, I wonder?",
  "27959": "Is it not a beautiful language and admirable?",
  "27960": "You do not add imagination to your other great qualities, but if you could for one moment put yourself in the place of this young man, would you choose the very night after the will had been made to commit your crime?",
  "27961": "Sdeath, what's this to me?",
  "27962": "Why, what other strangers are coming in?",
  "27963": "Why does the parent turn away from his child, and forbid him his presence for a time?",
  "27964": "And you ask me, whether I am an adherent of that church which maligns and damns you?",
  "27965": "You are rich?",
  "27966": "Do you know him still?",
  "27967": "If they were all bad, who had made them so?",
  "27968": "What encouraged me not to become your surety, but to patronize you?",
  "27969": "Who ever gave again the breath of a life lost?",
  "27970": "Did he say when he would be back?",
  "27971": "Yes or no, is it an honorable indemnity?",
  "27972": "As how?",
  "27973": "Do you imagine that this anaemic youth was capable of so frightful an assault?",
  "27974": "How many would you have?",
  "27975": "Otherwise why should she thus have concealed herself, fled from the face of others?",
  "27976": "Any money?",
  "27977": "Where stand his coursers?",
  "27978": "What are we coming to?",
  "27979": "And why is one person to be singled out from among millions, and arraigned before posterity as a traitor to his opinions only because events produced on him the effect which they produced on a whole generation?",
  "27980": "But the real cause was heart disease?",
  "27981": "But does he know this secret, then?",
  "27982": "Is he liked for himself?",
  "27983": "What should it be?",
  "27984": "We are overheard, then?",
  "27985": "You other two belong to this division?",
  "27986": "All or one?",
  "27987": "Are you really a connoisseur, now?",
  "27988": "You have an order signed by the cardinal?",
  "27989": "Why should the degree of sterility be innately variable in the individuals of the same species?",
  "27990": "Will you have chains, gold, tablets, rings?",
  "27991": "Where will you begin and where end?",
  "27992": "And what if he does not give in?",
  "27993": "Are you the musical girl?",
  "27994": "A quarrel, and what for, gentlemen?",
  "27995": "I mean your future does?",
  "27996": "Name, sir?",
  "27997": "How will the national workshop, which owes ITS WORKMEN GOOD WAGES, make up this deficit?",
  "27998": "Can I explain it?",
  "27999": "What have you been about?",
  "28000": "Toys?",
  "28001": "To your father?",
  "28002": "Mary?",
  "28003": "Meanwhile, what of the enemy?",
  "28004": "Or if there were any so precious as to be able to support this expense, with what safety could they be transported through the territories of so many barbarous nations?",
  "28005": "And what are these?",
  "28006": "Gering is her husband, eh?",
  "28007": "Why had he lived?",
  "28008": "Do you take for philosophy this twaddle, this intolerable pettifoggery adorned with a few scholastic trimmings?",
  "28009": "Suppose a watchman should pass?",
  "28010": "Who was fool enough to occasion this delay?",
  "28011": "They could be sold, then?",
  "28012": "Can you play anything?",
  "28013": "Ought I to have written?",
  "28014": "Do you care for that young fellow?",
  "28015": "Well, old lady?",
  "28016": "But you want to speak to me, I suppose?",
  "28017": "Where have you been?",
  "28018": "To compete with phrasemongers, incapable of thinking consecutively for sixty seconds?",
  "28019": "Have I the time?",
  "28020": "Tea?",
  "28021": "What did you begin to tell me about the prince?",
  "28022": "YOU think so?",
  "28023": "Can you give me no other weapon?",
  "28024": "Is that the moon?",
  "28025": "Nothing but saddles?",
  "28026": "Or would I have all the daughters at once in a perfect nosegay?",
  "28027": "Shall our eyes gaze on and on, and feast themselves on that sight for all eternity?",
  "28028": "What are you making such a noise about over there?",
  "28029": "What is your opinion of the gentlemen with the silk caps who thrive along the boulevard's on the delightful traffic which you know, and who make a living out of it?",
  "28030": "And your home?",
  "28031": "But perhaps you need not now?",
  "28032": "Of what colour is the tip?",
  "28033": "And now tell me what dress will you have?",
  "28034": "Lorry?",
  "28035": "WHAT'S better?",
  "28036": "Defend himself?",
  "28037": "And the number of those that are to be warmed thus hereafter is?",
  "28038": "Do you see this, monster?",
  "28039": "And how left you mine uncle?",
  "28040": "What necessity was there to seek this situation, and expose myself to misfortunes, affronts and remorse, for the sake of pleasures whose greatest charm was already exhausted?",
  "28041": "Were there no legitimate sons?",
  "28042": "But is it true that the country does wail?",
  "28043": "Our plans for the journey, do you remember?",
  "28044": "Will you tell me?",
  "28045": "Why could he not simply leave the monks alone, and go into the desert to repent?",
  "28046": "Oh, what was that?",
  "28047": "And a pair of oxen?",
  "28048": "Do you think that I felt easy in my mind about you, gentlemen?",
  "28049": "Why not apply the law to human groups, or nations?",
  "28050": "How could it go so far?",
  "28051": "Which is he?",
  "28052": "What would you have said about us then?",
  "28053": "But tell me, how did he?",
  "28054": "What do you demand from me?",
  "28055": "Have you, with her or anyone else, ever?",
  "28056": "Why did I promise?",
  "28057": "Who can it be?",
  "28058": "Is it particularly dangerous to give the keys of the treasury, and the command of the army, into the same hands?",
  "28059": "Are you absolutely obliged to straighten at once what is crooked?",
  "28060": "What is your pleasure now?",
  "28061": "Has anybody got anything to tell?",

  "28067": "What can that have to do with my marriage?",
  "28068": "But why do you ask that?",
  "28069": "Is everything ready?",
  "28070": "How did you know?",
  "28071": "Might I have not known that into the pit it was the object of the burning iron to urge me?",

  "28073": "Do you happen to know where he is stopping at present?",
  "28074": "Faith, how like you the fashion?",
  "28075": "Gentle reader, did you ever feel yourself snubbed?",
  "28076": "None?",
  "28077": "And since?",
  "28078": "And they call it the MUMPS?",
  "28079": "How would I call?",
  "28080": "And what is that great lord's name?",
  "28081": "Sit down, will you?",
  "28082": "Who was he?",
  "28083": "Did I not know the process?",
  "28084": "What for, mademoiselle?",
  "28085": "But what will you do?",
  "28086": "Believe ye, men, in the things called omens?",
  "28087": "When will they be here?",
  "28088": "How far is the nearest village from here?",
  "28089": "It is very terrible, is it not, to be like that?",
  "28090": "When two knights have met in an affray of arms and when one has beaten the other, which of the two do you think is the better?",
  "28091": "And where are these four men?",
  "28092": "And what have you gained?",
  "28093": "Was this possible?",
  "28094": "May I look at it?",
  "28095": "Did you get shook up much?",
  "28096": "You saw the person?",
  "28097": "And shall I caulk the seams, sir?",
  "28098": "Where's the wolf?",
  "28099": "Did they attempt to descend the stream in boats and go to wreck among the rapids?",
  "28100": "Think you not we might give him something to eat?",
  "28101": "So, sire, you say you want a million?",
  "28102": "Where is the old man who has been suffering innocently and in vain?",
  "28103": "Who has been tormenting the child?",
  "28104": "And the cardinal?",
  "28105": "Why should he not throw over his own people altogether, money, position, society, and all, and give himself up to love?",
  "28106": "Are you at all superstitious?",
  "28107": "You approve of him?",
  "28108": "And what was it that had suggested the tremendous tumult?",
  "28109": "Who subscribes?",
  "28110": "Tom, you naughty boy, where's your sister?",
  "28111": "Well, even you?",
  "28112": "And you are to go down at twelve?",
  "28113": "When again shall such infantile transparency be mine?",
  "28114": "But what was the matter with the old lumber nag?",
  "28115": "Or why is it suggested that three or four confederacies would be better than one?",
  "28116": "And you climb up?",
  "28117": "Who else could compare my brother's baby with your boy?",
  "28118": "Will it not be more safe, as well as more simple, to dismiss such vague and uncertain calculations, to examine each power by itself, and to decide, on general principles, where it may be deposited with most advantage and least inconvenience?",
  "28119": "As upon her lips, does she mean?",
  "28120": "You ?",
  "28121": "Why not be casual, drifting along, taking all for what it was worth?",
  "28122": "You want I shall tell you?",
  "28123": "Who are its inhabitants?",
  "28124": "Shall I tell you why?",

  "28140": "Would you tell him?",
  "28141": "Have you really burned it?",
  "28142": "Do you still remember your childhood?",
  "28143": "Well, what is it now?",
  "28144": "Did the old guy say anything more?",
  "28145": "And I shall find your eminence ready?",
  "28146": "Why was his hair tinted with gold?",
  "28147": "You desire to fathom this horrible secret?",
  "28148": "When a boat lies up the pilot has a holiday, and would not any of these jurors have then gone around to the bridge and gotten acquainted with the place?",

  "28155": "What's my name?",
  "28156": "You are the nineteenth century?",
  "28157": "And what was that?",
  "28158": "What is the self?",
  "28159": "And what is it?",
  "28160": "But what has this to do with you being alive?",
  "28161": "How do you need money?",

  "28937": "Was that all right?",
  "28938": "What is it?",
  "28939": "Why is the ardour of youth thus to be damped, and the luxuriancy of fancy cut to the quick?",
  "28940": "If there be no distinction between the pleasing and the disgusting, why does it accept the one or reject the other?",
  "28941": "What consolation does the poor suffering soul find in the superb coffin, in the splendid funeral?",

  "28956": "And you have been in the choir in pursuance of your duties?",
  "28957": "If all is well, why go to the lodge?",
  "28958": "In displaying anxiety for the breath of which he was at present so willing to get rid, might I not lay myself open to the exactions of his avarice?",
  "28959": "By what path did you get thither?",
  "28960": "Can we get behind his track so that they may smell it?",
  "28961": "You have how many new suits?",
  "28962": "How far mus go up, massa?",
  "28963": "Where's that?",
  "28964": "Is she discouraged, does she drag herself about the house and find fault with everything?",
  "28965": "What whole thing?",
  "28966": "Since it was your intention to live alone, why did you throw into the sea the document which put us on your track?",
  "28967": "If this were human life, if these were human beings, living in a complete world, then what was her own world, outside?",
  "28968": "We are at peace and, why then, should they harm us?",
  "28969": "Then you believe the papers?",
  "28970": "What must I do, officer?",
  "28971": "What do you like to talk about?",
  "28972": "Getting a bit hot, eh?",
  "28973": "If she had wished it, would she not have sent to me by this time?",
  "28974": "Or whom oppose?",

  "28976": "You, who refuse to tell me the slightest thing?",
  "28977": "Are we in any great danger?",
  "28978": "Or will a reaction set in which may arrest progress and even undo much that has been done?",
  "28979": "You are only responsible for my body, is it not so?",
  "28980": "But for this imaginary resistance, officially announced, how would it have been possible to justify the spoliations and exactions which ensued?",
  "28981": "How can you deliberately get up such paltry falsehoods?",
  "28982": "Afterwards to me?",
  "28983": "Shall you not all help me?",
  "28984": "What signified the terms to them, so long as we obtained the actual surrender of people who only wanted a good opportunity to give up gracefully?",
  "28985": "Shall I cut it out?",
  "28986": "Would not the doing of this be your best mode of counteracting his raid on your communications?",
  "28987": "After dinner, eh?",
  "28988": "Well, what, my dear girl?",
  "28989": "What would they say if I did not go?",
  "28990": "But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?",
  "28991": "But to what in the world?",
  "28992": "By your leave, do you know me, sir?",
  "28993": "He will be ruined, you mean?",
  "28994": "What of the prisoner?",
  "28995": "Do you not see that by its solidification, it would burst through this field of ice that imprisons us, as, when it freezes, it bursts the hardest stones?",
  "28996": "Then it appears there will be an opposition, and the enterprise will be disputed?",
  "28997": "Will you dine with me?",
  "28998": "Does he ever come back to this neighborhood?",
  "28999": "And, if ignorance of everything which it is needful a ruler should know is likely to do so much harm in the governing classes of the future, why is it, they ask reasonably enough, that such ignorance in the governing classes of the past has not been viewed with equal horror?",
  "29000": "And now, tell me your name?",
  "29001": "Do you fear their finding it here, should they come to search?",
  "29002": "Whither are they going?",
  "29003": "Was it a thicket?",
  "29004": "Was this the beginning of a happy change?",
  "29005": "Sir, may I have a few words with you concerning some business I have just decided upon?",
  "29006": "But where are you really going?",
  "29007": "What am dat?",
  "29008": "I hope there is no reason to distrust his fidelity?",
  "29009": "Of twelve rowers?",
  "29010": "How can one talk or think of such trifles?",
  "29011": "How does it happen that the presence of a woman overwhelms us so?",
  "29012": "Which do you know?",
  "29013": "You ask me what I will do?",
  "29014": "Then, surely, you will not object to lend it to us?",
  "29015": "And do you know what has become of him?",
  "29016": "Can you tell me, please, who is his favourite actor?",
  "29017": "What more could I hope to do by prolonging the interview?",
  "29018": "Pierced?",
  "29019": "What do you expect to get?",
  "29020": "Besides, was he not in the secret?",
  "29021": "Was it of any use to explain?",
  "29022": "Was it after all true that she had been conducting herself in a way that justified the world in thinking that she liked the man?",
  "29023": "And, pray, who are you yourself?",
  "29024": "Is it possible for such a reason?",
  "29025": "Oh, how could we, on your money?",
  "29026": "Why should I give you courage?",
  "29027": "And how much have you got?",
  "29028": "How are you, young man?",
  "29029": "I say, why are you so late?",
  "29030": "Will the job suit you?",
  "29031": "And who charges me with this, monseigneur?",
  "29032": "Shall I go on?",
  "29033": "To what do they seem to you to be like?",
  "29034": "And how stands the total?",
  "29035": "And did they not leave him on the south side of the river, with their prisoners, while they have gone foolishly on the north?",
  "29036": "Or spiders?",
  "29037": "But you receive him at your house?",
  "29038": "Was there a human agency in the matter?",
  "29039": "And what is the coachman like?",
  "29040": "Have we beheld demons?",
  "29041": "What is his religious doctrine to me, if he carries some good notions along with it?",
  "29042": "And when will that be, father?",
  "29043": "Who could have told her?",
  "29044": "That's it?",
  "29045": "How can I describe my sensations on beholding it?",
  "29046": "What can it be that has this double power?",
  "29047": "And yet you have sent for me?",
  "29048": "Why does a chicken cross the road?",
  "29049": "Who's got the job?",
  "29050": "Is she pretty?",
  "29051": "If ever you can get aboard again, says you?",
  "29052": "Shall I fire my rifle off and scare him?",
  "29053": "Have you ever told a lie?",
  "29054": "You have seen it on dozens of girls, and you never found out that it was pretty till now?",
  "29055": "What fiend possesses you to stare back at me, continually, with those infernal eyes?",
  "29056": "Even in the country do we get any rest?",
  "29057": "What is it, my friend?",
  "29058": "Why calls my friend?",
  "29059": "Were you examined at an inquest?",
  "29060": "How do they love it dressed?",
  "29061": "How can they get loose when there's a guard over them, ready to shoot them down if they move a peg?",
  "29062": "Your husband, then, is at last dead?",
  "29063": "Pillage?",
  "29064": "Is everyone all right?",
  "29065": "What do you say of this?",
  "29066": "Which do YOU think it was?",
  "29067": "Why is that gendarme there?",
  "29068": "But what are these beasts?",
  "29069": "You think your sister will come?",
  "29070": "You see him?",
  "29071": "Against the westland clans?",
  "29072": "He did not happen to see our plan of fortifications, did he?",
  "29073": "You are not going out, I hope?",
  "29074": "If a man with a broad basis of popular support like that was proposing to entertain a duke, surely there could be no doubt about his motives?",
  "29075": "Does your majesty grant me this?",
  "29076": "Where was the horse?",
  "29077": "When is it going to be?",
  "29078": "Do you still feel any desire to stand up in his defence?",
  "29079": "Do you know who made you?",
  "29080": "What sort of a watchman, of a checker, are you?",
  "29081": "I hoped it was true?",
  "29082": "After?",
  "29083": "Why will you not grant my last wish?",
  "29084": "Do you pay taxes to an agent that he may destroy your property?",
  "29085": "He would have to fly, and where?",
  "29086": "In a figurative sense, how far, and to what offences, may it be extended?",
  "29087": "And what do you think of him?",
  "29088": "The register of my child's birth?",
  "29089": "Was there one exception, and that one he who needed to have been most happy?",
  "29090": "Who is this maid?",
  "29091": "But what was she to do?",
  "29092": "The peasants are ruined?",
  "29093": "Who but a billionaire could say what was fair exchange for a billion?",
  "29094": "Two pounds, and you bring it back?",
  "29095": "What natural force could have produced such plants, and what must have been the appearance of the earth in the first ages of its formation, when, under the action of heat and moisture, the vegetable kingdom alone was developing on its surface?",
  "29096": "You love me just a little, then, marquise?",
  "29097": "Why are you virtuous?",
  "29098": "Are you far gone with a fool?",
  "29099": "What should I do?",
  "29100": "Is that all?",
  "29101": "Who, sire?",
  "29102": "I think I am a philosopher, perhaps, and who knows, perhaps I do wish to teach my views of things to those I meet with?",
  "29103": "Do I seem one to fear for myself?",

  "29106": "You have seen him, then?",
  "29107": "But, just what did the genewal tell you?",
  "29108": "There's nothing to keep you, is there?",
  "29109": "Nicholas, when when did you break your cameo?",
  "29110": "D'you remember the last time we met?",
  "29111": "What hope could there have been for him then?",
  "29112": "Outside of a private car?",
  "29113": "And what was this spring of the floor under his feet to the dizzy eccentric lurch with which in the old time the trembling ship yielded to the beat of staggering billows, drunk with their power?",
  "29114": "How is she ever to do better?",
  "29115": "You had heard that there was an execution in the house?",
  "29116": "Can you see where he has put his rifle or his bow?",
  "29117": "But who the deuce is he following?",
  "29118": "Are not necessary pleasures those of which we cannot get rid, and of which the satisfaction is a benefit to us?",
  "29119": "Can they understand or explain even their own characters?",
  "29120": "And why so?",
  "29121": "Is he a good doctor, my love?",
  "29122": "And where is your lodging?",
  "29123": "I hope, my dear friend, you will carry out your father's wish?",
  "29124": "You have knocked at all doors?",
  "29125": "Old man, how goes?",
  "29126": "Will you take my arm, sir?",
  "29127": "Is it in my character?",
  "29128": "Uncle, what wood is this?",
  "29129": "Well, what did he say then?",
  "29130": "There they were, the words, and what did she want more?",
  "29131": "What does he desire of me?",
  "29132": "Are you like all the rest?",
  "29133": "How dare you grin at me like that?",
  "29134": "Who will make me that summons?",
  "29135": "Especially with copper toes?",
  "29136": "Was it the effect of the lunar rays?",
  "29137": "What have you said?",
  "29138": "You never find he slights his work when your back is turned?",
  "29139": "Perhaps you would like to pay interest?",
  "29140": "Which is she?",
  "29141": "Is that any reason why we should propose to preserve it for ever in a condition of tutelage?",
  "29142": "And my walking up and down for three hours from the table to the stove?",
  "29143": "Would he choose the peers, for example?",
  "29144": "Why, how are you?",
  "29145": "Who persuaded them into letting him see if he could drive?",
  "29146": "Do you think you can behead me with a single blow?",

  "29156": "It is not so?",
  "29157": "Then I shall really have them?",
  "29158": "So you go back from your promise?",
  "29159": "May she?",
  "29160": "Do you remember what I said when you asked me what I should do if I won all the pots I set my heart on and came through alive?",
  "29161": "Is it too great?",
  "29162": "At it again, hey?",
  "29163": "Which was it?",

  "29177": "How did I survive and surmount such wounds?",
  "29178": "How often we sin, how much we deceive, and all for what?",
  "29179": "Will soon what?",
  "29180": "And we recognize also that this absolute equality has only been known, and can only be known, through the medium of sight or touch, or of some other of the senses, which are all alike in this respect?",
  "29181": "Know you anything of your own family at that time?",
  "29182": "And from a noble client?",
  "29183": "So that, in fact, you have never learned or heard anything in particular?",
  "29184": "What was said or done?",
  "29185": "And where will your worship drink?",
  "29186": "How is it that you have no friends in your prosperity when you had many in adversity?",
  "29187": "King's attorney?",

  "29189": "HERE?",
  "29190": "If he were in love with the lady?",
  "29191": "Why does she come so close?",
  "29192": "And will he be the better for that?",
  "29193": "What's the matter with your nose, there?",
  "29194": "Now I ax what have they to show for their three months' setting?",
  "29195": "Cherries?",
  "29196": "How are we to know them if we do find them?",
  "29197": "What about the other girl, the one you decoyed away over a week ago?",
  "29198": "How could she not be happy?",
  "29199": "It has been a delightful evening, has it not?",
  "29200": "Had they not searched exactly where the document stated?",
  "29201": "How you like it, hey, ole sport?",
  "29202": "But what human language can adequately portray that astonishment, that horror which possessed me at the spectacle then presented to view?",
  "29203": "At best, might not a man in the water lose all his power of direction, and so move in an endless circle until he sank exhausted?",
  "29204": "Does his wife know of it?",
  "29205": "And what is the solar heat?",
  "29206": "If any one were to come in, my dear boy?",
  "29207": "Has your grace taken the precaution to come out in a good stout pair of boots?",
  "29208": "Whet, whoiver knew yah wur coming?",
  "29209": "Where would you wish to go?",
  "29210": "Why do I think of her as dressed in green?",
  "29211": "How could he take the infant from the mother's breast, or abandon the daughter to the fatal influences from which only, by so violent an effort, he could free the son?",
  "29212": "Was that all a human being amounted to?",
  "29213": "But you would not advise me to refuse?",

  "29222": "Want any?",
  "29223": "And could it be believed that it at last seems to us as if the problem had never been propounded before, as if we were the first to discern it, get a sight of it, and RISK RAISING it?",
  "29224": "If you come to that, it's hardly my place to be flung out of the flat like this and have to go to an hotel, what?",
  "29225": "Will you open, yes or no?",
  "29226": "If so, on what does your constitution rest?",
  "29227": "With whom?",

  "29310": "And in what way does he who thinks that wisdom is the discernment of the tempers and tastes of the motley multitude, whether in painting or music, or, finally, in politics, differ from him whom I have been describing?",
  "29311": "What man could be more lovable than such a man as would grow from such a boy?",
  "29312": "Why should not we also enjoy an original relation to the universe?",
  "29313": "Are you thinking I'm safe?",
  "29314": "Well, what of it?",
  "29315": "What's he up to now, I wonder?",
  "29316": "What do you keep on doing it for?",
  "29317": "Did you receive the despatch?",
  "29318": "He is living?",
  "29319": "Shall I really tell you?",
  "29320": "What will our friends think of us, who may chance to be upon the street and witness our frivolous antics?",
  "29321": "Or a subjugator?",
  "29322": "How long have you been married?",
  "29323": "Yet who is there does not sometimes hazard it for the enjoyment of an hour?",
  "29324": "Now for what, my dear friend?",
  "29325": "What was their languid grace but the softness of chambering?",
  "29326": "Was it not natural that, in the indignation excited by their wrongs, they should turn to the man who had laid the axe to the root of the tree which bore such fruit, and at least consider the possibility of profiting by his work?",
  "29327": "Could I count them on my fingers?",
  "29328": "May I come in?",
  "29329": "Are you for the rich or for the poor?",
  "29330": "Whose is he?",
  "29331": "Who has been telling you about him?",
  "29332": "Have you nothing else to tell him?",
  "29333": "Worse?",
  "29334": "What would the best of us be if he were suddenly placed at war with the whole world?",
  "29335": "What are you bothering for?",
  "29336": "Do you seek any guidance from me?",
  "29337": "How on earth should she talk of any one else as long as you are here?",
  "29338": "And a narrative it remains both in the speeches which the poet recites from time to time and in the intermediate passages?",
  "29339": "And others say even that the external world is the work of our organs?",
  "29340": "Am I sorry?",
  "29341": "And, indeed, unless this shoal had a machine in its stomach, how could it change its position with such astonishing rapidity?",
  "29342": "Could the prisoners see each other?",
  "29343": "But why do you ask?",
  "29344": "Are you quite sure, then, that you WILL come to see him often?",
  "29345": "Till then, will you be one, sir?",
  "29346": "And will you undertake to deliver it?",
  "29347": "Well, did you like it?",
  "29348": "Where is my aunt?",
  "29349": "You are horrified?",
  "29350": "Who can say where the dominion of mind over matter ceases?",
  "29351": "But if you think all servitude intolerable, to what purpose serve your complaint against your particular governors?",
  "29352": "If he were so delighted by my visit, why had he not crossed the lawn at once as soon as he saw the car?",
  "29353": "What odds then?",
  "29354": "But what shall it be?",
  "29355": "Oh, it comes out, then, in the photograph?",
  "29356": "Who denies it?",
  "29357": "Will you give me some money?",
  "29358": "Do you love me so much, then?",
  "29359": "Were you there?",
  "29360": "Why so dull and mute, young sinner?",
  "29361": "But he paid your ransom?",
  "29362": "And how is your sister?",
  "29363": "When you shall have taken this money back to your prince, what advice will you give him?",
  "29364": "Is that the way you talk?",
  "29365": "Where the baker who, retiring from business, leaves his customers and his establishment to his assistants?",
  "29366": "No bad?",
  "29367": "And is not their humanity to the condemned in some cases quite charming?",
  "29368": "Is it not because they have not enough at home wherewith to fill their bellies and their pokes?",
  "29369": "You suppose they really TALK of them?",
  "29370": "Do you know, my husband, why I came here?",
  "29371": "What, was it conscience then?",
  "29372": "Why has fate given you two such splendid children?",
  "29373": "It is a good sight to see, I suppose?",
  "29374": "Salted them on me?",
  "29375": "What are you by trade?",
  "29376": "Now, are you ready?",
  "29377": "I wanted to know if, loving her and wishing her happiness, you would consider it good for her to marry me?",
  "29378": "Where are you bound?",
  "29379": "Has he been moved?",
  "29380": "Or shall we not establish our equality in this manner?",
  "29381": "Why had he come to this house?",
  "29382": "And if that is true, what sort of general must he have been?",
  "29383": "What's the case now?",
  "29384": "Why may I not rest me from this restlessness and sleep from this wide waking?",
  "29385": "And do you know this gentleman, monsieur?",
  "29386": "Presently?",
  "29387": "Then I have been your property, have I?",
  "29388": "Is that really the case?",
  "29389": "Are the passes open?",
  "29390": "To go to the bottom?",
  "29391": "If you are going into the operations of commerce who will look after the government?",
  "29392": "What strength had I to dart retaliation at my antagonist?",
  "29393": "Have you seen him?",
  "29394": "And why should we have done it?",
  "29395": "Do you hear that flourish of trumpets?",
  "29396": "How long shall I be your victim?",
  "29397": "What on earth put that into her head?",
  "29398": "And when shall you come back again?",
  "29399": "You say the affair was decisive?",
  "29400": "And how did he make his money?",
  "29401": "Mamma?",
  "29402": "What do you expect me to do?",
  "29403": "About my what?",
  "29404": "So you understand the whole position of our troops?",
  "29405": "How want of love tormenteth?",
  "29406": "What became of this little boy?",
  "29407": "Torpenhow?",
  "29408": "Why, please your ladyship, said her kinsman, what signifies all you say?",
  "29409": "Does he mean that?",
  "29410": "But what do we do?",
  "29411": "You have no doubt of their reality?",
  "29412": "Is my father here?",
  "29413": "You still bear in mind what it means?",
  "29414": "And there you sit, I suppose, all the day long, eh?",
  "29415": "Why, as to improvements, magnify the evil, and stoutly refuse to see any good in them?",
  "29416": "From the earth, in the sky?",
  "29417": "If you shall be a cuckold?",
  "29418": "And the unjust man will strive and struggle to obtain more than the unjust man or action, in order that he may have more than all?",
  "29419": "Why did not you kick him out, and let her in, and say I'll be an honest wife and a noble woman from this hour?",
  "29420": "What, all five out at once?",
  "29421": "Do you think that there is anything so very unnatural or inexcusable in their case?",
  "29422": "What else should I have done?",
  "29423": "And know you the news?",
  "29424": "As lovely as WHO?",
  "29425": "What route must we take?",
  "29426": "And not play too?",
  "29427": "What did she say?",
  "29428": "Was the skull nailed to the limb with the face outwards, or with the face to the limb?",
  "29429": "Could you decide now?",
  "29430": "Made to be amused only?",
  "29431": "And what other wretchedness would come to him?",
  "29432": "You have never heard of papa, I suppose?",
  "29433": "What's to become of you out here?",
  "29434": "Where is he then?",
  "29435": "Now what horrible thing can have happened?",
  "29436": "Should he sacrifice more men, with so few chances of saving those already sacrificed?",
  "29437": "Have you not yourself already had the same fear?",
  "29438": "Have the men taken cover?",
  "29439": "Does he weep?",
  "29440": "Should he find an issue?",
  "29441": "What's the use of our trying to do anything, trying to know anything, trying to be anything?",
  "29442": "What could be better than to combine these accounts, and make up a complete narrative from them all?",
  "29443": "You pledge yourself to that, marshal?",
  "29444": "This humour?",
  "29445": "Say, does my arrow miss or hit the mark?",
  "29446": "From whom did he inherit them?",
  "29447": "What did you say her address was?",
  "29448": "How can we be reconciled?",
  "29449": "Shall I marry and settle down?",
  "29450": "But was he ill?",
  "29451": "How, indeed, could a lasting concord be maintained by two such disparate characters?",
  "29452": "Is THAT spiritual, her bullying, her conceit, her sordid materialism?",
  "29453": "Is?",

  "29458": "Often, in the midst of his gravest souvenirs, after a day of conflict with the whole diplomacy of the continent, he returned at night to his apartments, and there, exhausted with fatigue, overwhelmed with sleep, what did he do?",
  "29459": "Unreservedly?",
  "29460": "Where does discretion end, and avarice begin?",
  "29461": "Is it not evident that this gallery was once the way open to the course of the lava, and that at that time there must have been a free passage?",
  "29462": "And who is the man?",
  "29463": "If we are a bane, why do you marry us?",
  "29464": "Who plucks the bud before one leaf put forth?",
  "29465": "Do you wish to go on the water, sir?",
  "29466": "Why, what has she done?",
  "29467": "Assassinate poor little me?",
  "29468": "But why do you want this settled?",
  "29469": "Why, then, is man thus imposed upon, or why does he impose upon himself?",
  "29470": "Why, how the deuce can I be more explicit?",
  "29471": "I go out?",
  "29472": "Where was this coach, in the name of gracious?",
  "29473": "With what day shall I begin?",
  "29474": "Was that a command to him to go?",
  "29475": "What should social, intelligent, and free beings have learned from this uncertainty of value?",
  "29476": "What has that got to do with it?",
  "29477": "Will gratitude be sufficient for a heart which knows not two manners of bestowing its affections, and feels itself incapable of everything except friendship?",
  "29478": "Is that so much amiss?",
  "29479": "You adhere to that resolution?",
  "29480": "Did you ever hear any woman speak like her?",
  "29481": "Would your honor let me make another turning?",
  "29482": "Do you keep plate in the house, or anything to attract burglars?",
  "29483": "Can we repair the injuries which it may have done to individuals?",
  "29484": "And is this all?",

  "29498": "Did I mean to say any thing against his character?",
  "29499": "And you would agree that to conceive things as they are is to possess the truth?",
  "29500": "Is it like a whale?",
  "29501": "What use do you make of these men?",
  "29502": "After all, who would have looked for such bitter satire from a creature so young, and so exquisitely beautiful?",
  "29503": "Who could tell you that?",
  "29504": "But why not?",
  "29505": "Could the hope of being king do it?",
  "29506": "Shall we start?",

  "29534": "You must know SOMETHING about her?",
  "29535": "Who is that that has just come in?",
  "29536": "And you know what that word means?",
  "29537": "In what month?",
  "29538": "What does the executioner?",
  "29539": "And what is it now what you've got to give?",

  "29551": "Who was that?",
  "29552": "Where is there any to be found?",
  "29553": "Might we get closer to salvation?",
  "29554": "But what can be said in defence of a ruler who is at once indifferent and intolerant?",

  "29562": "Are you going too?",
  "29563": "Does nobody overhear us?",
  "29564": "Whose then?",
  "29565": "Is it not significant that a contact with new ways of thinking has a tendency, at least, to make men broaden their horizon and to revise some of their views?",
  "29566": "Was it respect?",
  "29567": "Do you want my medicine rubbed all over your body?",
  "29568": "Was he good to you?",

  "29573": "What would they, you know, really?",
  "29574": "Now that we have outgrown them why should we go back to them?",
  "29575": "What has he given me?",
  "29576": "If we acted in time, might we not even yet escape before the general alarm was sounded?",
  "29577": "What more?",
  "29578": "Why do you do it?",
  "29579": "Laurie, I want you to do me a favor, will you?",
  "29580": "Then she looks upon you as a stranger?",
  "29581": "And now, vile wretches, do you desire to treat with me by word of mouth?",
  "29582": "Is this your decision, monseigneur?",
  "29583": "And what good does it do you?",
  "29584": "Have you the nerve to go through with it?",
  "29585": "Quaere?",
  "29586": "What can I say to describe the wonderful effects of such a pure and unpolluted air?",
  "29587": "But after all, what did it matter?",
  "29588": "How does the fellow manage to love two of them?",
  "29589": "Why cannot we walk outside like the meteor?",
  "29590": "Did perhaps their hearts despond, because lonesomeness had swallowed me like a whale?",

  "29593": "While we are adjusting our relations with the rest of the world is it not of capital importance that we should clear away all grounds of misunderstanding with our immediate neighbors and give proof of the friendship we really feel?",
  "29594": "When shall I see you again?",
  "29595": "And what may be the ages of these two, ma'am?",
  "29596": "Who, then, would not imagine that such conduct as will inevitably destroy what all are thus labouring to acquire, must generally be avoided?",
  "29597": "Was she going to try to bulldoze him into submission?",

  "29625": "The rickety rafters?",
  "29626": "No son?",
  "29627": "Or what are they ornamented with?",
  "29628": "And they are all in for this examination?",
  "29629": "And the ear has an end and an excellence also?",
  "29630": "You are not angry with me for coming?",
  "29631": "Did you ever see the like of it in your life?",
  "29632": "I trust and hope you never repeated to the count all the foolish remarks we used to make about him?",
  "29633": "Why, let me see, how old are you?",
  "29634": "What else could he do?",
  "29635": "That voice?",
  "29636": "And these men were your friends?",
  "29637": "What better issues could a man want?",
  "29638": "Not to be afraid really to speak?",
  "29639": "I call it a very serious thing, eh?",

  "29641": "What time did you start?",
  "29642": "And with what result?",
  "29643": "And now you will be our companion?",
  "29644": "And what is this way?",
  "29645": "Because?",
  "29646": "Which route must I take?",
  "29647": "Now, what is it you say?",
  "29648": "And do you dare look in my face, after that shameful deed?",
  "29649": "Let me ask, sir, what great exploits have you performed?",
  "29650": "Why have you come?",
  "29651": "What wages do you ask?",
  "29652": "But where are they taking her?",
  "29653": "Doing anything now, are you?",
  "29654": "It relates to some great event, then?",
  "29655": "Have you any letters of hers?",
  "29656": "How should any one coming from a wider world not feel the difference and be attracted by it?",
  "29657": "And how is it she has not pride enough to see it?",
  "29658": "Is she feeling the same as I?",
  "29659": "What is his extent?",
  "29660": "Then the truth is too bad to tell?",

  "29666": "Many of them?",
  "29667": "Oh, you do, do you?",
  "29668": "And this is a letter, is it?",
  "29669": "Where shall I find you?",
  "29670": "Will you fight me?",
  "29671": "Do you love me still?",
  "29672": "Which is the way out, please?",
  "29673": "Now, what's your name?",
  "29674": "How can it, by coming quickly into the eyes and ears, distinguish the pleasing from the disgusting in external objects?",
  "29675": "You love it, do you?",
  "29676": "And, yet, how could it be otherwise?",
  "29677": "Why had this agent preserved silence?",
  "29678": "How can you not know?",
  "29679": "But how came he to be there?",
  "29680": "Do you wish to destroy me?",
  "29681": "And he who is most skilful in preventing or escaping from a disease is best able to create one?",
  "29682": "What remained to her of primitive virtue?",
  "29683": "This, sir?",
  "29684": "Jo, dear, what is it?",
  "29685": "How would you like to have some tableaux in here?",
  "29686": "With this boy?",
  "29687": "Do you know who I am?",
  "29688": "When I spoke in confidence to your brother, could I regard him as an inquisitor?",
  "29689": "Did you court her for her wealth?",
  "29690": "You are acquainted?",
  "29691": "But what would be the use of new continents?",
  "29692": "Have I kept my promise, yes or no?",
  "29693": "There used to be a certain amount of solidity in all things, but now what happens?",
  "29694": "Because I love the court?",
  "29695": "Can one ever tell anyone what one is feeling?",
  "29696": "Who knows how easy it is for ambition to call itself vocation?",
  "29697": "Was it my mother's or my father's act?",
  "29698": "Is this a carelessness, or what?",
  "29699": "Might they not hang him at once, and inquire into his case afterward?",
  "29700": "What do they say?",
  "29701": "Had she really any life of her own behind all her propagandism?",
  "29702": "Do you think this would be the first time a woman had repented of an infidelity?",
  "29703": "Do you think our little girl here need be afraid?",
  "29704": "Can you tell me why you foster the cruel deception?",
  "29705": "What else has the world given me for all that I have done for it?",
  "29706": "And what good will it do you?",
  "29707": "Why joke?",
  "29708": "And is not the truest pity, when a man has a sore point, not to touch it at all?",
  "29709": "Are you satisfied?",
  "29710": "Who would hear her?",
  "29711": "Do you not see that they are all giving me the wink, and wanting me to turn you out by force, only I do not like to do so?",
  "29712": "And what is the pay?",
  "29713": "Has he now some disciples?",
  "29714": "To sleep?",
  "29715": "What'll it be?",
  "29716": "But a little rakish, hey?",
  "29717": "With friends like that, who needs enemies?",
  "29718": "A bride?",
  "29719": "Or what is become of them?",
  "29720": "Is he indeed, sir?",
  "29721": "But is not your eminence going to the queen?",
  "29722": "At once?",
  "29723": "Will it be long first?",
  "29724": "But am I sure?",
  "29725": "Rita?",
  "29726": "Who took that step?",
  "29727": "What's better in him?",
  "29728": "But why should I make a long story?",
  "29729": "If error is possible there, why not here?",
  "29730": "Nothing else?",
  "29731": "Have you not left off your impudent pretensions there yet?",
  "29732": "That is all true, then, is it?",
  "29733": "Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary clothes on?",
  "29734": "May we see it now?",
  "29735": "Was he the only applicant?",
  "29736": "A man who has paid every penalty for wrong, if wrong there was?",
  "29737": "You surely will not do that, my dear count?",
  "29738": "What did this mean?",
  "29739": "Well, sir, what is it?",
  "29740": "In what place, captain?",
  "29741": "Then where are the other people?",
  "29742": "Very bad, eh?",
  "29743": "What do you think of this?",
  "29744": "Where is your justification for inflicting all this pain?",
  "29745": "Why should we consider ourselves, men and women, as broken fragments of one whole?",
  "29746": "Is a man who has a sudden attack of pain in tooth or stomach not to be permitted to go to the nearest druggist's shop and ask for something that will relieve him?",
  "29747": "Then, is she dying?",
  "29748": "Are you all right now?",
  "29749": "Where've you hid your letters?",
  "29750": "What is the matter with her?",
  "29751": "And what favor, pray?",
  "29752": "What do you want to have me here for?",
  "29753": "What mad pursuit?",
  "29754": "Why not?",
  "29755": "But what would you have me do, child?",
  "29756": "Had she tried her strength again, what had that availed?",
  "29757": "Of what complexion?",
  "29758": "Is she to be shown up to your room?",
  "29759": "And, if I said so, to whom would the place belong?",
  "29760": "If they are not, with what propriety can the like power justify such a charge against the national government, or even be urged as an obstacle to its adoption?",
  "29761": "Is no one about who can get in?",
  "29762": "Will you have brilliants, or a castle by the sea, or, perhaps, a yacht?",
  "29763": "Do they follow us so far?",
  "29764": "But even if one might, what feeling except veneration could such a man as my father evoke?",
  "29765": "Who will give it to me?",
  "29766": "Who is so bold as to do it?",
  "29767": "Why did you come here to find me, then?",
  "29768": "English?",
  "29769": "Auntie, what have I done?",
  "29770": "Where's your shells?",
  "29771": "Is it your business, eh?",
  "29772": "Do you see that island?",
  "29773": "You think that she would refuse me?",
  "29774": "Did you sleep badly?",
  "29775": "Is it because we are invited?",
  "29776": "Will you walk a little bit with me?",
  "29777": "Do you deny that you were listening at that door?",
  "29778": "How soon may we hope to get back?",
  "29779": "Is the wind north or south?",
  "29780": "Yet how could he think her capable of deliberately wishing to renew their assignations now?",
  "29781": "Aluminum?",
  "29782": "How could it have been me?",
  "29783": "What makes you say that?",
  "29784": "What's that that has fallen?",
  "29785": "Has judgment been pronounced?",
  "29786": "And who is the criminal?",
  "29787": "Can he spare you?",
  "29788": "Shall we ever know?",
  "29789": "But who the devil has fortified this paltry little place in this manner?",
  "29790": "Do you remember any case at all like it?",
  "29791": "What am I to do now?",
  "29792": "About me?",
  "29793": "It is then the interest of the enemies of this potentate to secure and publish this letter, so as to make a breach between his country and ours?",
  "29794": "Brooke?",
  "29795": "Is it funny?",
  "29796": "But if so, where was the girl, and what had she done with the papers?",
  "29797": "And you did not know any one else on the train?",
  "29798": "You intend to remain?",
  "29799": "No guarantee?",
  "29800": "And if it knew, would it dare?",
  "29801": "And what do you call that little metal ruler?",
  "29802": "What is advantage?",
  "29803": "My little woman, why do you look at me in that way?",
  "29804": "What do you want to say?",
  "29805": "Is yours a long part?",
  "29806": "Gentle?",
  "29807": "What is POLITICS?",
  "29808": "What did their tears imply?",
  "29809": "What shall the court do?",
  "29810": "But what do YOU think?",
  "29811": "If he had not lost his balance, why should he have launched into an almost passionate defence of the physical coward?",
  "29812": "And is it not very rational to conclude, that the women who have not been taught to respect the human nature of their own sex, in these particulars, will not long respect the mere difference of sex, in their husbands?",
  "29813": "What is the object of these questions?",
  "29814": "How much may it amount to?",
  "29815": "Shall I tell him all, then, openly?",
  "29816": "Oswald, have you not your mother to come to the rescue?",
  "29817": "O, do you know me, man?",
  "29818": "And how do you get on with the officers?",
  "29819": "How dare you come when you're not wanted?",
  "29820": "Is it certainly accursed?",
  "29821": "But to do this he must have spoken?",
  "29822": "Have you ever died yet?",
  "29823": "Who would ever suspect me, me, me, especially if I should choose a being I had no interest in doing away with?",
  "29824": "Trust to the sword the fortunes of the world?",
  "29825": "And even if there's a delay, how can it alter the end?",
  "29826": "It will not be opened when the hearing is resumed?",
  "29827": "Then what does he do?",
  "29828": "Have the rebels been successful up to this time?",
  "29829": "You saw this?",
  "29830": "You want a serious duel?",
  "29831": "Are not your people dead?",
  "29832": "Will you lose by him, then?",
  "29833": "Who could have taken it out?",
  "29834": "Your little share?",
  "29835": "Are you hurt?",
  "29836": "And why be at the charge of providing logic of the best quality, when a very inferior article will be equally acceptable?",
  "29837": "Or rather at what he said?",
  "29838": "Then in what do you intend to be married, unnatural girl?",
  "29839": "Have you nearly concluded your argument?",
  "29840": "What, in short, is his character?",
  "29841": "Where can she have come from?",
  "29842": "What's his trade?",
  "29843": "Yet why not?",
  "29844": "Does he not perceive us?",
  "29845": "Has she?",
  "29846": "Who is entitled to the rent of the land?",
  "29847": "Would it not be wise for us to make a change?",
  "29848": "How might he be more brave?",
  "29849": "As, indeed, how should any of those prim and reputable virgins?",
  "29850": "What was that noise about?",
  "29851": "Have you watched?",
  "29852": "Twas shameful, was it not?",
  "29853": "Or is it only because you must?",
  "29854": "Had a bath this morning?",
  "29855": "What shall I say or do?",
  "29856": "Are you then pressed for this money?",
  "29857": "What's that you got?",
  "29858": "Pardon this rascal?",
  "29859": "The sound of the spur?",
  "29860": "Not a civil list?",
  "29861": "Now you laugh?",
  "29862": "And is this true of all opposites?",
  "29863": "She is a living creature, why should she stand anything, just because you choose to make her?",
  "29864": "A minister?",
  "29865": "Who am I?",
  "29866": "Are there many descends between here and the place whither you are going?",
  "29867": "What have we all done, then, dear grandpapa?",
  "29868": "The exact sum?",
  "29869": "I JUSTICE, WHETHER A NATURAL OR ARTIFICIAL VIRTUE?",
  "29870": "My commands?",
  "29871": "Or rather do I not wrong those whom I ought least to wrong?",
  "29872": "Which is best, to draw from nature or from the antique?",
  "29873": "Is he not much handsomer and better built than that great chucklehead?",
  "29874": "Or any greater good than the bond of unity?",
  "29875": "What now could he do for his boy except die?",
  "29876": "And if that's the case, what do they mean by wanting me to believe that he is enchanted?",
  "29877": "What are you saying about the militia?",
  "29878": "A horse and two men?",
  "29879": "You will say nothing to me?",
  "29880": "Looking after your niece when you're dead and gone, and getting a husband for her, eh?",
  "29881": "Will you give me the first son you have?",
  "29882": "Ah, is it you, baron?",
  "29883": "Jeanette?",
  "29884": "How did you get out of it?",
  "29885": "What would you recommend me to READ?",
  "29886": "How do you know she has not seen them?",
  "29887": "Have you brought me any more?",
  "29888": "Have you heard any bad news?",
  "29889": "Where had she been during that strange expedition?",
  "29890": "But what is the meaning of all these soldiers everywhere?",
  "29891": "Was that a work for your hands?",
  "29892": "But how does that knowledge help us?",
  "29893": "Might not the philosopher elevate himself above faith in grammar?",
  "29894": "Where was the ceremony performed?",
  "29895": "Who is he?",
  "29896": "What is it to me, who have passed twenty years between life and death?",
  "29897": "You do not fear, I imagine, that these gentlemen could stave in walls on which the balls of your frigate have had no effect?",
  "29898": "That little log house where there was a pile of pumpkins in the yard?",
  "29899": "Where is everybody?",
  "29900": "But how?",
  "29901": "What's verdigrease?",
  "29902": "But the general and his succor?",
  "29903": "Is the poor gentleman much hurt?",
  "29904": "But what made them let us go?",
  "29905": "What is dreadful?",
  "29906": "And who are these others?",
  "29907": "Then the tyrant is removed from true pleasure by the space of a number which is three times three?",
  "29908": "You must love somebody?",
  "29909": "The last load, eh?",
  "29910": "If you lecture in the schools do you not go to whoever pays you most?",

  "29916": "Well, how do you stand affected towards your lady?",
  "29917": "Yes or no?",
  "29918": "I hope you will be there?",
  "29919": "What use would he make of the power now?",
  "29920": "Are we really going to be walking around the moon inside of thirty minutes?",
  "29921": "Why do you speak of a housemaid so contemptuously?",
  "29922": "If the sense of common interest were not our original motive to obedience, I would fain ask, what other principle is there in human nature capable of subduing the natural ambition of men, and forcing them to such a submission?",
  "29923": "You surely do not suppose that I have nothing better to do than to study such publications as these?",
  "29924": "Will you move quickly?",
  "29925": "You are not wounded, I hope?",
  "29926": "He will grow more and more indolent and careless?",
  "29927": "Is that very embarrassing?",
  "29928": "What will he like him to be called?",
  "29929": "What do you wish me to do?",
  "29930": "Honest man, could not you throw me ashore?",
  "29931": "Who is not a cannibal?",
  "29932": "What other course was left for us to pursue?",
  "29933": "Was that the case, said he, truly, and from your heart?",
  "29934": "Shall you be happy if I do what you wish?",
  "29935": "As I account so largely by sexual selection for the differences between the males of allied species, how can the differences between the females be accounted for in all ordinary cases?",

  "29937": "Whose manner, child?",
  "29938": "What were you doing behind the curtain?",
  "29939": "And therefore a soul which is absolutely a soul has no vice?",
  "29940": "Then in every way the laws will help the citizens to keep the peace with one another?",
  "29941": "What does that mean, romantic?",
  "29942": "Could it?",
  "29943": "Those charming meetings?",
  "29944": "Do you hear the cracking?",
  "29945": "And who shall silence all the airs and madrigals that whisper softness in chambers?",
  "29946": "Ought I before giving him the slap to say a few words by way of preface?",
  "29947": "Where do you get your information from?",
  "29948": "Are you warm, darling?",
  "29949": "What officers?",
  "29950": "But the mark in your hand?",
  "29951": "What right have we human beings to happiness?",
  "29952": "What are you hiding?",
  "29953": "I hope you are pretty well?",
  "29954": "But what did you take?",
  "29955": "What are you trying to suggest?",
  "29956": "So I see, but does it follow that he is your property?",
  "29957": "How dare you stay here when you heard me call?",
  "29958": "But what guarantee have I?",
  "29959": "And why should one ask for advice, who does not expect to gain his health?",
  "29960": "What did you say your name was?",
  "29961": "Who are you?",
  "29962": "Do we?",
  "29963": "What do you mean, sir?",
  "29964": "What else could I think?",
  "29965": "But ask not, to what doctors I apply?",
  "29966": "But does he care for her?",
  "29967": "Are you sure you're well enough?",
  "29968": "What assures me, sir?",
  "29969": "What harm, then, could a man do in the moat?",
  "29970": "Smallweed?",
  "29971": "Does not your heart feel that they imply great earnestness in life?",
  "29972": "Do you ever dream of me?",
  "29973": "Do you think people, if they had received no injury, would come such a journey only to calumniate your father?",
  "29974": "And do you know how pretty you are, child?",
  "29975": "You are sure of that?",
  "29976": "Why did the five fellows out of the higher line run away for that?",
  "29977": "Was this not indeed a veritable hell, peopled by lost souls, dead and damned beyond all hope?",
  "29978": "Oh, suppose we did, and had to stay out all night?",
  "29979": "A young man?",
  "29980": "Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught?",
  "29981": "Whose prisoner was she?",
  "29982": "Anything more, sir?",
  "29983": "Who can have robbed it of the beauty that gladdened it, of the grace and gaiety that charmed it, of the modesty that shed a lustre upon it?",
  "29984": "And indeed what does the price matter, if the trick be well done?",
  "29985": "Confound you, have you been rummaging round among my clothes, then?",
  "29986": "Is it wrong to see the beauty of the almond blossoms, wrong to taste the scented wind?",
  "29987": "Do you know how long it would take for an express train to reach the moon?",
  "29988": "Will you tell me how long you have loved him?",
  "29989": "It's breakfast you want, is it?",
  "29990": "You saw the ventilator, too?",
  "29991": "Then you never believed in the principality?",
  "29992": "And is not my brother dead?",
  "29993": "Where is the green door?",
  "29994": "So now we are friends again, are we not?",
  "29995": "Will you three months hence be in a situation to perform the journey more at your ease than at present?",
  "29996": "But is that case could I have expected more from him than from my own brother?",
  "29997": "You say that I am safe and sound?",
  "29998": "How can one think of him as bad?",
  "29999": "Will I not guard, and cherish, and solace her?",
  "30000": "Why did he hesitate?",
  "30001": "You had my note?",
  "30002": "What sorrows?",
  "30003": "The seen is the changing, and the unseen is the unchanging?",
  "30004": "Hope?",
  "30005": "And who has struck the blow?",
  "30006": "Have yo been sowing wheat long?",
  "30007": "Why should one not explore everything, and study everything?",
  "30008": "You have heard of the magi, perhaps?",
  "30009": "What does he do for a living?",
  "30010": "What toast?",
  "30011": "And why would you be so fond to overcome the famous wrestler?",
  "30012": "Will you write a book?",
  "30013": "Was it some incident, some sorrow, that led you to take life vows?",
  "30014": "Are you there?",
  "30015": "Why should he?",
  "30016": "Why make all these excuses?",
  "30017": "How do you like us?",
  "30018": "What make you here?",
  "30019": "Is he quite gone away?",
  "30020": "Well, what do you say, are we going shooting tomorrow?",
  "30021": "Consoled?",
  "30022": "Do you suppose I want to be told where to go?",
  "30023": "But did there not exist in the island some animal which might supply the place of the horse, ass, or ox?",
  "30024": "Shall I?",
  "30025": "Did she speak of the man?",
  "30026": "What was to be done?",
  "30027": "You do not care if he does?",
  "30028": "Who was the unknown companion of her dream?",
  "30029": "And what a devil is become of them?",
  "30030": "Did you never hear that from the young girls where you come from in the west or south?",
  "30031": "The night porter saw nothing, I suppose?",
  "30032": "For who can guess?",
  "30033": "And so you think that I ought to answer your indictment as if I were in a court?",
  "30034": "What need they?",
  "30035": "Who?",
  "30036": "Regular people who get you a place?",
  "30037": "Is this a practical joke?",
  "30038": "Why should they ever be afraid to dash up and harry us, when they know full well that they run no greater risk at our hands than if we were stumps in their orchards?",
  "30039": "How do you mean?",
  "30040": "Sweeter unpossess'd, have I said of her my sweetest?",
  "30041": "Has this cruelly treated girl been able to walk home?",
  "30042": "But you'll keep your word true?",
  "30043": "It really is rather like me, is it not?",
  "30044": "What did he know about its value, or what did any one know?",
  "30045": "Is this second infinity intelligent also?",
  "30046": "And to which?",
  "30047": "You like them, then?",
  "30048": "Will they establish a censorship to distinguish between men of genius and fools?",
  "30049": "How am I to know?",
  "30050": "Well, and what then?",
  "30051": "But who is she?",
  "30052": "What is that, madame?",
  "30053": "And when is he to be married?",
  "30054": "And what are the other teachers called?",
  "30055": "You have had nothing to eat, my pet?",
  "30056": "When do you expect to be here?",
  "30057": "One asked him if he was going to be married?",
  "30058": "What light is that on the hill?",

  "30064": "How if she will not come?",
  "30065": "What's that you're reading?",
  "30066": "Why have you set upon me in the dark?",
  "30067": "That is your father, is it not?",
  "30068": "What is the voice of history?",
  "30069": "You are setting off, then?",
  "30070": "And he really succeeded?",
  "30071": "You have not heard then of what they are accused?",
  "30072": "Why should he come again?",
  "30073": "What sort of a figure would he make if he escaped?",
  "30074": "How you must have hated me after THAT evening?",
  "30075": "And YOUR cheese, your excellency?",
  "30076": "And yet you saw how she thanked me, with her so beautiful dying eyes, her voice, too, so weak, and she kiss my rough old hand and bless me?",
  "30077": "In what respects?",
  "30078": "Had I caught her off her guard?",

  "30080": "Can you have any difference with your father?",
  "30081": "Going away, sir?",
  "30082": "What's it about?",
  "30083": "Then it is he whom you suspect?",
  "30084": "What is your rank?",
  "30085": "And ruined her character?",
  "30086": "Why wish to fly till you have got your wings?",
  "30087": "Pretty well?",
  "30088": "The executioner, in short?",
  "30089": "A merchant?",

  "30091": "What can I say to him?",
  "30092": "Which did she choose?",
  "30093": "May I ask what position she holds in your household?",
  "30094": "What right have we to say that this is the people's will?",
  "30095": "If he was his confederate, why should he carry his photograph?",
  "30096": "Are beauties there as proud as here they be?",
  "30097": "And if not, what else did she imagine?",
  "30098": "Were you not, gentlemen, both in the musketeers of the late king?",
  "30099": "How long his he been there?",
  "30100": "What is this oven for?",
  "30101": "Nay, will not such a one often rejoice more than any other in the rich show of outer apparel?",
  "30102": "What does that nonsense mean?",
  "30103": "Would the selfish and the cowardly ever lack reasons for yielding to the enemy?",
  "30104": "Do you see any inconvenience in having an army at the end of a year, instead of two regiments?",
  "30105": "Forgiveness?",
  "30106": "Well, in what case is it just that the tax should take the form of a levy on polls?",
  "30107": "Are they dead or alive?",
  "30108": "Do you know anything of it, fellow?",
  "30109": "What preservation can you now desire after the destruction of your temple?",
  "30110": "And what she said to you?",
  "30111": "Did you ever suppose you'd see the day when you'd be adopting an orphan girl?",
  "30112": "I wonder if this can be the person we're looking for?",
  "30113": "First, then, they resemble one another in the value which they set upon wealth?",
  "30114": "What did he repeat to us all the day?",
  "30115": "What are you saying to her?",
  "30116": "You're dancing, are you?",
  "30117": "Hate you, sir?",
  "30118": "Would you know him again?",
  "30119": "If I consent to announce you, may I at least know whom to announce, monsieur?",
  "30120": "What's wrong with my face?",
  "30121": "Had that begun in your time?",
  "30122": "Never been there?",
  "30123": "Is he not in love?",
  "30124": "What did she answer?",
  "30125": "Do you dare to say that I am not right?",
  "30126": "What are the facts?",
  "30127": "Somebody has called?",
  "30128": "What use will peace be when he is no longer here?",
  "30129": "Unable to grasp any thing great, is it surprising that they find the reading of history a very dry task, and disquisitions addressed to the understanding, intolerably tedious, and almost unintelligible?",
  "30130": "The inhabitants of the island and the sailors?",
  "30131": "You've got a mark upon you somewheres or another, I suppose?",
  "30132": "Where are all the listeners and spies who accompany the queen?",
  "30133": "What is this gnawing of conscience I am feeling now?",
  "30134": "What, are they gone, sirs?",
  "30135": "Whom the deuce can it be from?",
  "30136": "Need there now be any secrets between us?",
  "30137": "Was not he sent for?",
  "30138": "But why on earth should you be pursued with such animosity?",
  "30139": "Further, there can be no doubt that a work is spoilt when not done at the right time?",
  "30140": "What is it in your hand?",
  "30141": "Do you remember that I paid it you ten days later, and you put it at the bottom of the tobacco?",
  "30142": "Did he mention the precise order of occupation to which he would addict himself?",
  "30143": "But be seated, and tell us now what is the cause of your docility?",
  "30144": "What the devil right have you to interfere?",
  "30145": "Has he decided to do so?",
  "30146": "And with how many fingers does he bless?",
  "30147": "Do you think I cannot see?",
  "30148": "If I preserve my purity in the society of the trees, why should he who would have me preserve it among men, seek to rob me of it?",
  "30149": "What had happened to bring this shocking change about?",
  "30150": "DID you see all the diamonds those ladies wore?",
  "30151": "How is that?",
  "30152": "With that?",
  "30153": "Did you recognize?",
  "30154": "What have we done, what has this poor thing done, that we are so sore beset?",
  "30155": "Must hate and death return?",
  "30156": "Why not view it often by faith?",
  "30157": "They are not fit for me, are they?",
  "30158": "Any lazy idle loafers that want flogging in this class?",
  "30159": "Why, then, do I not hear them?",
  "30160": "Do you accept my solution of the mystery?",
  "30161": "Not one year, madame?",
  "30162": "Was it right or wrong?",
  "30163": "Have you understood how our dog was so strangely thrown up out of the water of the lake, after his struggle with the dugong?",
  "30164": "How have you defended me?",
  "30165": "What are their sufferings?",
  "30166": "How about the widows and orphans confided to you?",
  "30167": "Is life to be purchased by such a sacrifice?",
  "30168": "What tell you me of fasting days?",
  "30169": "And have the children looked after themselves at all, sir?",
  "30170": "A dress for you, also, is it not, my friend?",
  "30171": "Coavinses?",
  "30172": "Had we a river, a lake, a sea to depend upon?",
  "30173": "But nobody possesses it, so what would you have?",
  "30174": "You have made it up?",
  "30175": "How, then, could they provide for themselves, and when had they time to plough and sow their fields?",
  "30176": "Was her husband, to whom it legally belonged, to make it over to her as a free gift?",
  "30177": "Is what you hear at church, religion?",
  "30178": "And what enlargement do you expect to obtain in this way?",
  "30179": "Plans?",
  "30180": "What might be the consequences?",
  "30181": "Would she have pitied him had she seen him?",
  "30182": "Aronnax?",
  "30183": "In your own heart, do you feel quite certain?",
  "30184": "Or you, my lords, to be my followers?",
  "30185": "It is true?",
  "30186": "Then in time of peace justice will be of no use?",
  "30187": "But how could you guess what the motive was?",
  "30188": "When will you come?",
  "30189": "Is it possible, then, to love, if you are not loved?",
  "30190": "Will you be her servants?",
  "30191": "Would she never issue from it?",
  "30192": "There's nothing wrong?",
  "30193": "NOT a party in anything, ma'am?",
  "30194": "Have I cut my heart into a demd extraordinary number of little pieces, and given them all away, one after another, to the same little engrossing demnition captivater, and can I live to be suspected by her?",
  "30195": "Then what?",
  "30196": "Supper?",
  "30197": "Can anyone do much for anyone else unless by making a will in his favour and dying then and there?",
  "30198": "Then?",
  "30199": "Has anything worried you?",
  "30200": "And who shall then stick closest to ye, and excite others?",
  "30201": "Can I rely upon you?",
  "30202": "Oh, you are the young feller who did that poster?",
  "30203": "Do you know of any houses?",
  "30204": "Do you mean to say that this slip of paper will help us?",
  "30205": "What identity?",
  "30206": "Did you bring the things I mentioned?",
  "30207": "But, my lord, if there be no secret of penitence, will the director consent to my being here?",
  "30208": "Do you have a faith, or a knowledge, you follow, which helps you to live and to do right?",
  "30209": "Is not this what we would have all men do to us?",
  "30210": "You hussy, how dare you talk in that way?",
  "30211": "Now, what shall we do?",
  "30212": "Which should it be?",
  "30213": "Will you follow me?",
  "30214": "What else can I do?",
  "30215": "How would you like to come into a house and find everyone muttering to themselves?",
  "30216": "And can the just by justice make men unjust, or speaking general can the good by virtue make them bad?",
  "30217": "You're sure?",
  "30218": "Are we to see profound wisdom in this?",
  "30219": "Is it not, said she, whispering her husband in his ear, is it not a noble nose?",
  "30220": "Who'll keep THEM quiet?",
  "30221": "Had any difference arisen between him and her papa?",
  "30222": "And what shall I?",
  "30223": "Not so much so?",
  "30224": "May I see it?",
  "30225": "Tell me, do you know what the countess, for whose pardon you are beseeching me, has done?",
  "30226": "Had she not openly avowed her intention of marrying for money if she ever had the chance?",
  "30227": "That the boy may sink and perish?",
  "30228": "Whose there?",
  "30229": "Been there long?",
  "30230": "Which is the way?",
  "30231": "Or his starch'd beard?",
  "30232": "Who knows what may be in store for you yet?",
  "30233": "By this?",
  "30234": "And not long?",
  "30235": "Is that certain?",
  "30236": "Are you asleep?",
  "30237": "Any ideas?",
  "30238": "Have we been deceived by an illusion?",
  "30239": "Was it physical?",
  "30240": "Caution?",
  "30241": "Did not you know that, my dear lord?",
  "30242": "Did not your friend here look like me?",
  "30243": "What are you rattling in there?",
  "30244": "But again, will they tell us that such a nature, placed under favourable circumstances, will not be perfectly good and wise if any ever was?",
  "30245": "Has not one of you a cross?",
  "30246": "And what does the judge affirm to be the life which is next, and the pleasure which is next?",
  "30247": "Was my uncle stark mad?",
  "30248": "Or have we found angels in the forms of kings to govern him?",
  "30249": "More in your brains than in your pocket, eh?",
  "30250": "He has come, then, as they told me?",
  "30251": "The only unofficial detective?",
  "30252": "Have you had lunch yet?",
  "30253": "Far from here?",
  "30254": "Whither is it carrying me?",
  "30255": "And where are they looking for her?",
  "30256": "Who told you this?",
  "30257": "Of what was he thinking?",
  "30258": "Do you think it is too much?",
  "30259": "D'you remember you were rather sniffy about meeting him?",
  "30260": "Is that what you wished to say?",
  "30261": "How much of the ballast of conservatism and of loyalty to tradition is it well to throw overboard in the interest of accelerated motion?",
  "30262": "Shall a similar end be pursued for the ethical purpose of widening the circle of those who shall live and be happy?",
  "30263": "Why have they not seized me?",
  "30264": "When did it happen and what has happened?",
  "30265": "You see?",
  "30266": "How could we like a people who treated us so unjustly?",
  "30267": "When shall the day come when we shall lift our hands?",
  "30268": "Are you then making a thesis?",
  "30269": "Would you like me to bring some rice?",
  "30270": "Who do you want?",
  "30271": "And is my life to be forfeit, is some terrible punishment to come on my poor old head for that which I cannot help?",
  "30272": "You will be frank with me?",
  "30273": "And was that the head and front of his offending?",
  "30274": "And must he not be represented as such?",
  "30275": "But what's he doing here?",
  "30276": "While he indulged himself in this state, amidst a profound silence, the curate, approaching him with great reverence, asked him if he would not be pleased to honour him with his company at dinner?",
  "30277": "He said nothing more?",
  "30278": "And even if he has done wrong, how do I know that he has not condemned himself?",
  "30279": "And do they give you frogs to eat, so's to make you limber?",
  "30280": "A doctor?",
  "30281": "What did you do?",
  "30282": "Would he allow imitation to be the ruling principle of his life, as if he had nothing higher in him?",
  "30283": "Can I spare him?",
  "30284": "What now?",
  "30285": "Armed?",
  "30286": "Or may not all three be properly allotted to it?",
  "30287": "Anything up?",
  "30288": "Is that so?",
  "30289": "You do not wish to hear it, perhaps?",
  "30290": "What does it matter to me?",
  "30291": "And will not a true astronomer have the same feeling when he looks at the movements of the stars?",
  "30292": "Why, what else are they?",
  "30293": "And s'pose he steps in here any minute, and sings out my name before I can throw him a wink to keep quiet?",
  "30294": "And the just is the good?",
  "30295": "How have I deviated from those principles, monsieur?",
  "30296": "But why FOUR pounds?",
  "30297": "And what did you find?",
  "30298": "What has he come here for?",
  "30299": "Are you inside?",
  "30300": "Downright?",
  "30301": "Do you think she'll miss you?",
  "30302": "Why was it necessary to weave the queen into this gloomy web of guilt and crime?",
  "30303": "I suppose that is why you live in town?",
  "30304": "What was the result of that memorable expedition?",
  "30305": "What, then, is the defence?",
  "30306": "What do you mean by risk?",
  "30307": "What would be the use?",
  "30308": "How could she make such nails work?",
  "30309": "Am I not the wife of my husband?",
  "30310": "What came after?",
  "30311": "Supposing her to be as good a woman as any you can find, which she certainly is not, why do you wish to connect yourself with anybody at present?",
  "30312": "What is the proposition?",
  "30313": "So?",
  "30314": "How is the snatchblatch?",
  "30315": "Just?",
  "30316": "Did you hear anything of it when you were in those parts?",
  "30317": "What is in this?",
  "30318": "And through what deplorable madness had she thus ruined her life by continual sacrifices?",
  "30319": "Where are the marks of its fangs?",
  "30320": "Who was this novice in war with the effrontery of a luminary?",
  "30321": "In my precinct?",
  "30322": "May this young lady go with us?",
  "30323": "Has no one come to seek her in this land?",
  "30324": "Then you'll be free?",
  "30325": "Monseigneur?",
  "30326": "Is it not sad?",
  "30327": "Can people enchant each other too much, cajole each other too much, charm each other too much?",
  "30328": "Why do they grease the axles of the wheels?",
  "30329": "If there be doubt as to which of our divisions will get our candidate, is there no doubt as to which of your candidates will get your party?",
  "30330": "What did you take me to your mother for?",
  "30331": "And did they ask you to make a speech?",
  "30332": "But how about money?",
  "30333": "You here at this hour?",
  "30334": "Well, then, was it this eye or that through which you dropped the beetle?",
  "30335": "What did your excellency say?",
  "30336": "Will you then swear to me, that you will never, under any pretext, and from any motive whatsoever, betray to anybody, so much as a single word of what I am now about to tell you?",
  "30337": "Where are you going, you rascal?",
  "30338": "Do you know, my friends, what that plain, seen from the height we are at, resembles?",
  "30339": "What was the good of bringing him?",
  "30340": "Where was it?",
  "30341": "Would she be decent to him, or would she scold him?",
  "30342": "Which is the best wish to wish him?",
  "30343": "Why sadden the poor children, and damp their newly cherished hopes?",
  "30344": "And you feel convinced that you must break with him?",
  "30345": "Alone, where?",
  "30346": "And you saw him frequently?",
  "30347": "Why is she so glad?",
  "30348": "But why do you ask?",
  "30349": "What new treasures lay here for science to unfold?",
  "30350": "Rochester?",
  "30351": "What's coming on?",
  "30352": "Are we to wonder, then, if here and there we find in his works an offensive expression?",
  "30353": "Why not cut it?",
  "30354": "What does the letter mean, mother?",
  "30355": "Are we rising into a fiery furnace?",
  "30356": "What substances will you proscribe?",
  "30357": "And what method of surveillance do you employ?",
  "30358": "Oh, well, as it were, what?",
  "30359": "Of how much?",
  "30360": "But we could not prevent it, could we?",
  "30361": "You get your percentage out o' the purchase, I suppose?",
  "30362": "Food enough for all?",
  "30363": "Has she told you she likes me much?",
  "30364": "Why should I envy them?",
  "30365": "What did he say to you?",
  "30366": "But if he were taken back again he would imagine, and truly imagine, that he was descending?",
  "30367": "My friend, my friend, why thus grieve me?",
  "30368": "How does that strike you?",
  "30369": "Forty pounds?",
  "30370": "But I mean another piece?",
  "30371": "Are all voters enlightened?",
  "30372": "And his level, whether higher or lower, could it possibly be the same as hers?",
  "30373": "What makes you so sure?",
  "30374": "What is it in the nature of the oak that causes it to send its root down into the soil and to drink up of its substance?",
  "30375": "What's he going to read?",
  "30376": "Where shall I go?",
  "30377": "Are then at this time the revolutions of the heavens, the constellations of the firmament, and aspects of the planets such, that whosoever shall lose a hatchet shall immediately grow rich?",
  "30378": "What was the primitive tissue?",
  "30379": "How much do you pay a week?",
  "30380": "And he is named?",
  "30381": "How came you by the knowledge?",
  "30382": "Why not win to freedom?",
  "30383": "And if not in the worst, why is it to follow at all?",
  "30384": "What, pray?",
  "30385": "Wherefore?",
  "30386": "Shall I be that?",
  "30387": "And what shall we say of such things as religious duties, of cheerfulness, of good manners, of personal cleanliness?",
  "30388": "Or, have you been a bad steward to yourself, and wasted your property in lawsuits and the like?",
  "30389": "Ah, who put it up?",
  "30390": "But light?",
  "30391": "What has opened her eyes?",
  "30392": "And would you indeed damn your precious soul?",
  "30393": "Well, did you see her safely off?",
  "30394": "Why, how are all the folks at home?",
  "30395": "Are these persons, then, so rich and powerful?",
  "30396": "Can it give heat to a dead body?",
  "30397": "Where's the use of looking nice, when no one sees me but those cross midgets, and no one cares whether I'm pretty or not?",
  "30398": "And the king has seen the cardinal?",
  "30399": "Detain him?",
  "30400": "And return to life, if there be such a thing, is the birth of the dead into the world of the living?",
  "30401": "Or do you also hate the duke your husband?",
  "30402": "Do you know who it is from?",
  "30403": "Have you been to the opera?",
  "30404": "Not a word to your loving mother, who was growing older too?",
  "30405": "Has your majesty no other orders to give me?",
  "30406": "But what are you going to do with him, now he is alive?",
  "30407": "And what shall I do when papa and you leave me, and I am by myself?",
  "30408": "Why is he sleeping there?",
  "30409": "Had he not told her, yes, told her to make a list, and not to admit anyone who was not on that list?",
  "30410": "Were her fears realized?",
  "30411": "I suppose it bowled the poor blighter over absolutely?",
  "30412": "Who introduced this innovation?",
  "30413": "You are perhaps a tulip fancier?",
  "30414": "May I go in and look?",
  "30415": "When will we be married?",
  "30416": "You're in the habit of shaking hands?",
  "30417": "And which is wise and which is foolish?",
  "30418": "But then he had the woman he loved still remaining?",
  "30419": "All ready forward?",
  "30420": "Is there any one here?",
  "30421": "But can such a head be found?",
  "30422": "And ten?",
  "30423": "Do you think if I drink water it would take off this hiccup?",
  "30424": "And this one opposite, who is this?",
  "30425": "Neither may they imitate smiths or other artificers, or oarsmen, or boatswains, or the like?",
  "30426": "How was it possible for one poor tongue, so reviled and persecuted, so humbled, insulted, and triumphed over, to resist three tongues in league against it?",
  "30427": "What was become of them?",
  "30428": "Shall we gather strength but irresolution and inaction?",
  "30429": "And what was in the sealed iron chest?",
  "30430": "How do you know about it, and who are you, anyhow?",
  "30431": "What next?",
  "30432": "Deserted?",
  "30433": "When did you get in?",
  "30434": "Will it hit us?",
  "30435": "Do you want to be doing the same?",
  "30436": "Who will bring us bread?",
  "30437": "My friend, what do you tell me?",
  "30438": "Their whistle?",
  "30439": "Where in the world did you get that song?",
  "30440": "Is he very clever?",
  "30441": "Who did I get the statues from?",
  "30442": "Will you have some whiskey and water?",
  "30443": "What news?",
  "30444": "Struck me?",
  "30445": "And you are up?",
  "30446": "What point?",
  "30447": "What is the use of one horse for us two?",
  "30448": "The cardinal was your protector?",
  "30449": "Are the other camels better or worse than that?",
  "30450": "What two lines?",
  "30451": "At twenty minutes to nine?",
  "30452": "Whom have I to love?",
  "30453": "And the rocks with their various strata?",
  "30454": "Did I not say right?",
  "30455": "What could he, an old man, do?",
  "30456": "And now what does he do?",
  "30457": "Is he so?",
  "30458": "Then, at all events, he DID sleep here, did he?",
  "30459": "My name?",
  "30460": "And why should I not?",
  "30461": "How could I escape from this situation?",
  "30462": "Which was the more important, which the less important part?",
  "30463": "You call them that, too?",
  "30464": "But by what means?",
  "30465": "Not come yet?",
  "30466": "Ever hear of lones the packer, hey, ole chappie?",
  "30467": "Is it quite original?",
  "30468": "Did he do that?",
  "30469": "Why should he trust himself to a balloon, that would blaze up like a piece of paper?",
  "30470": "You saw it?",
  "30471": "Like him?",
  "30472": "Would you take a seat, sir?",
  "30473": "And yet what else am I to do?",
  "30474": "Well, have you heard from your husband lately, my dear?",
  "30475": "You refused him?",
  "30476": "How did you know that?",
  "30477": "Can she make your real flecky paste, as melts in your mouth, and lies all up like a puff?",
  "30478": "Yes, what is it?",
  "30479": "Should he stay at home with her, her mother and her sisters?",
  "30480": "Would you like to come up and see her?",
  "30481": "What would you like to do tomorrow?",
  "30482": "Will that arrangement suit you?",
  "30483": "And you shall be included in it, in our happiness, do you hear, father?",
  "30484": "FLOATED?",
  "30485": "Have you eaten anything?",
  "30486": "Did she feel as he did?",
  "30487": "Water to drink?",
  "30488": "You will not serve me, sir, will you?",
  "30489": "How should he be?",
  "30490": "Again, has he greater experience of the pleasures of honour, or the lover of honour of the pleasures of wisdom?",
  "30491": "Is it nothing to hold one's peace?",
  "30492": "And you can do nothing until then?",
  "30493": "When, where?",
  "30494": "Yes, but still all this has to be looked after, and who is there to look after it?",
  "30495": "How much will you give me for it?",
  "30496": "What have I to say to them?",
  "30497": "When are you coming back?",
  "30498": "Can anyone be surprised if one gets fond of such a ship?",
  "30499": "Oh, not her?",
  "30500": "If the loyal people united were put to the utmost of their strength by the rebellion, must they not fail when divided and partially paralyzed by a political war among themselves?",
  "30501": "But what is worship?",
  "30502": "In arms against me?",
  "30503": "Do you wish for a proof?",
  "30504": "Where, then?",
  "30505": "Prove?",
  "30506": "Little woman?",
  "30507": "Shall it be said, good reader?",
  "30508": "Are you glad to leave us, dear?",
  "30509": "What had that harsh tyrant of hers done that was good or serviceable for her?",
  "30510": "Can one be well while suffering morally?",
  "30511": "Where would be that thrill if I had been as definite as a timetable?",
  "30512": "How long otherwise?",
  "30513": "Tony, where are you going, my charmer?",
  "30514": "What does this tell us?",
  "30515": "How does she use you?",
  "30516": "In the nick of time?",
  "30517": "How?",
  "30518": "Mind it?",
  "30519": "How can I help myself?",
  "30520": "Where has he gone?",
  "30521": "That visit not succeeding either, you will go again perhaps?",
  "30522": "Husband, are you as kind and gentle toward your wife as you should be?",
  "30523": "For what is death?",
  "30524": "If I see, clearly see, that ladder leading from plant to man, why should I suppose it breaks off at me and does not go farther and farther?",
  "30525": "Lively?",
  "30526": "Another glass?",
  "30527": "Why should he not try rather to fortify himself, to add to his courtiers, to continually obtain new subsidies, and finally to free himself from dependence on the people, the inevitable goal of all power originating in the people?",
  "30528": "Did he take that medicine, men?",
  "30529": "Who would suppose it?",
  "30530": "When was that done which settled the matter?",
  "30531": "What did you say, sir?",
  "30532": "What would be the result of a total extraction of the nitrogen?",
  "30533": "Do you not suspect?",
  "30534": "Did it keep you awake?",
  "30535": "Need any help, officer?",
  "30536": "What's the row now?",
  "30537": "Why are you so bad?",
  "30538": "She never spoke to a soul?",
  "30539": "Could I ever have believed then that I could come to such humiliation?",
  "30540": "Do you belong to the nobility?",
  "30541": "D'you think they care for us?",
  "30542": "You bring me great news, then, monsieur?",
  "30543": "Did I say above, or seem to imply, that the judge sometimes spoke harshly to his wife?",
  "30544": "And we have admitted that justice is the excellence of the soul, and injustice the defect of the soul?",
  "30545": "Did you really?",
  "30546": "What was he doing?",
  "30547": "Is he out of his senses?",
  "30548": "Who then?",
  "30549": "Why do I feel so inclined to tease him?",
  "30550": "What monstrous place is this?",
  "30551": "Where is the use of our reckoning?",
  "30552": "You are AFRAID of it?",
  "30553": "Where is the prisoner?",
  "30554": "Is he generally liked?",
  "30555": "Do you mean write to her myself?",
  "30556": "So soon?",
  "30557": "Genius, or insanity, who can say?",
  "30558": "Will not the guardians be the smallest of all the classes who receive a name from the profession of some kind of knowledge?",
  "30559": "A telegram?",
  "30560": "At whose house?",
  "30561": "Is this possible, count?",
  "30562": "Which of them do you call her best friend?",
  "30563": "Is sugar always to be produced by vital blood?",
  "30564": "Was it a fear that he should deliver this name to the hazards of another memory than his own?",
  "30565": "You think it's certain he's there?",
  "30566": "Would they not have been as unwilling to part with them as with gold, and have compelled them to stay at home with them?",
  "30567": "What could she do but sob?",
  "30568": "What was that you told me before we left the old house?",
  "30569": "Beautiful and lusty?",
  "30570": "And is not the soul almost or altogether indissoluble?",
  "30571": "Buried amongst them, what met my eye?",
  "30572": "Might he not well inform the doctor that he had something to tell him for his advantage?",
  "30573": "Or is this a subject in which new discoveries can be made?",
  "30574": "Has he got to be harnessed up and driven through life like a horse?",
  "30575": "Assuming also, again I say, that physical obstacles can be overcome, is not the time opportune for making a start?",
  "30576": "Are you badly hurt?",
  "30577": "Has he many men, then?",
  "30578": "Will there be mercy for me there?",
  "30579": "I hope your father is well?",
  "30580": "Why then am I dissatisfied if I am going to do the things for which I exist and for which I was brought into the world?",
  "30581": "I tell you?",
  "30582": "You are no longer my father?",
  "30583": "And why, my young friend?",
  "30584": "If we were jurymen, what would we do with this parricide?",
  "30585": "What did they do it for then?",
  "30586": "Can you rely on his word?",
  "30587": "Why the coal country?",
  "30588": "Is that possible?",
  "30589": "What the prime cause of all my woe doth prove?",
  "30590": "Well, brigadier, what is he charged with?",
  "30591": "Look here, what does this mean?",
  "30592": "Liver?",
  "30593": "Will you not speak to them?",
  "30594": "Why, who are you, bold fellow, to range so boldly here?",
  "30595": "You want to speak to me, do you?",
  "30596": "And where is the wounded officer?",
  "30597": "And afterwards?",
  "30598": "What is your illustration?",
  "30599": "He has still hope, but what is it he hopes?",
  "30600": "In a tree?",
  "30601": "The question is, whether it procures most pain or pleasure?",
  "30602": "What's the matter with your legs?",
  "30603": "Who says that?",
  "30604": "How can I play a trick on a monkey?",
  "30605": "What kind of a bird is he?",
  "30606": "But how did you come here?",
  "30607": "Then it is settled?",
  "30608": "Where am I to die?",
  "30609": "What ought to be done?",
  "30610": "How now?",
  "30611": "But will you tell me?",
  "30612": "And do the enchanted sleep, now, senor?",
  "30613": "Is there anything else you would like?",
  "30614": "And you DO think something better of me than you did?",
  "30615": "Shall I not visit for these things?",
  "30616": "And how did it go so fast, so straight ahead, with such staring, staring eyes?",
  "30617": "Do they love?",
  "30618": "What should be done with the elephant, which had been so dearly purchased?",
  "30619": "Was he not handsome?",
  "30620": "In making him a duke?",
  "30621": "How can you dare to speak to me like that?",
  "30622": "Whose was it?",
  "30623": "How did I lose her?",
  "30624": "Well, and what did the lady do?",
  "30625": "This has been done so often, and what good has ever come from it?",
  "30626": "Where do the lord and lady sleep?",
  "30627": "But whither am I wandering?",
  "30628": "With what kind of order?",
  "30629": "Why, then, refuse to follow to the end the road opened by science, and to admit an hypothesis which is the inevitable result of experience itself?",
  "30630": "But do you think we shall find the count at home?",
  "30631": "And what I am, to you my friends, now am I not?",
  "30632": "Do you conceive any thing but merely that perception?",
  "30633": "Who are these men you have brought before us?",
  "30634": "Some one holds you in restraint?",
  "30635": "Did you think he came directly from town?",
  "30636": "What's the news?",
  "30637": "Is not the president's shoulder still bleeding from the blow it has received?",
  "30638": "Wiggins?",
  "30639": "Oh, when are you going?",
  "30640": "Why should I care?",
  "30641": "What could you do for a boy like that?",
  "30642": "Does it think?",
  "30643": "Why should we ask what comes after the experience, when the experience is still unknown to us?",
  "30644": "Was he not the prince of men?",
  "30645": "Are not these dread words for a nation bearing in her bosom so mighty an injustice?",
  "30646": "What has happened?",
  "30647": "On what days?",
  "30648": "Or what hopes have we of deliverance by thus continuing faithful to such wicked wretches?",
  "30649": "Who's accused you?",
  "30650": "But the question again recurs, upon what pretense could he be put in possession of a force of that magnitude in time of peace?",
  "30651": "What can I do for the son?",
  "30652": "What, after the last?",
  "30653": "That I might lose them?",
  "30654": "Who is my mother?",
  "30655": "Why not let me send for this pleasant lady?",
  "30656": "Will somebody obleege me with a spittoon?",
  "30657": "Do you think it is a wig?",
  "30658": "You sat in front of his writing desk?",
  "30659": "Had she no tears for the rough friend who laughed at the silk shoes, and taught her how to hold the reins and never fear that the old pony would run away with her?",
  "30660": "Where could my uncle be at that moment?",
  "30661": "Why should I guard me?",
  "30662": "What am I to say or to do to make you understand that my only idea of happiness is the idea that sooner or later I may get you to be my wife?",
  "30663": "Why did he not tell it?",
  "30664": "What was the reply?",
  "30665": "Did business men commonly go into an expenditure of money which could be of no account to them?",
  "30666": "And then, in the next place, was it probable that the dean would act upon such a letter by filling up the vacancy, even if he did get it?",
  "30667": "And if not, WHO IS IN THE ROOM besides you and me?",
  "30668": "Must it of necessity be admitted that this power is infringed, so long as a part of the old articles remain?",
  "30669": "Had any papers been handed about among them, similar to these lists?",
  "30670": "On what charge do you expect to be arrested?",
  "30671": "But what can we expect from a turnip?",
  "30672": "And what am I now?",
  "30673": "Well, what happened when you did get there?",
  "30674": "You say two faces were familiar to you?",
  "30675": "You opened the letter?",
  "30676": "But what are all these birds doing in heaven?",
  "30677": "Is this, also, some enchanted person?",
  "30678": "But what was it?",
  "30679": "I mean to say, what?",
  "30680": "Ha, friend?",
  "30681": "And what about his wife and family?",
  "30682": "Is it necessary that a bourgeoisie which stands in such need of you should disown you?",
  "30683": "Suppose he were taken prisoner again?",
  "30684": "Now, my good fellow, how are you?",
  "30685": "She was about to say?",
  "30686": "Do you have a teaching?",
  "30687": "Has labor, once so fecund, likewise become sterile?",
  "30688": "A signal for others?",
  "30689": "What then is that which is able to conduct a man?",
  "30690": "Well, what are these buildings?",
  "30691": "What does he want to go out for again?",
  "30692": "You know that great pause that comes upon things before the dusk?",
  "30693": "You wish me, then, to relate the history of my past sorrows?",
  "30694": "What the charm that floats the bowl?",
  "30695": "When did that happen?",
  "30696": "Are you sure they can be relied on?",
  "30697": "What will come of it all?",
  "30698": "Was there any mention made of my uncle or me?",
  "30699": "In what does it consist?",
  "30700": "Then I am not to be allowed to have anything to do with it officially?",
  "30701": "Can I go, can I go?",
  "30702": "Or will you be my friend, as you have been hitherto, and do what I request?",
  "30703": "Do you mean it?",
  "30704": "What is that queer concern going down the river?",
  "30705": "Was that all she said I said?",
  "30706": "But how cast off all the superfluous, devilish burden of my outer man?",
  "30707": "Why then is that rather a misfortune than this a good fortune?",
  "30708": "There now, what is it?",
  "30709": "Oh, my father, must your past career always interfere with my successes?",
  "30710": "Have I furnished it nicely?",
  "30711": "What am I doing here, anyway?",
  "30712": "From what causes do I derive my existence, and to what condition shall I return?",
  "30713": "Who put that paper there?",
  "30714": "Will you tell me what you're going to do with the skin?",
  "30715": "Do you suppose I am going to bring my ropes, my windlass, and set it up, and go down there with my boy and let myself be bitten, perhaps, by your cursed dog for the pleasure of giving it back to you?",
  "30716": "What will you do, then?",
  "30717": "What sort of a life could we build on such foundations?",
  "30718": "Ay, said I, but who can help constitution?",
  "30719": "Not chilled, pet, are you?",
  "30720": "Gone?",
  "30721": "Where had you seen me before?",
  "30722": "And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a fait accompli?",
  "30723": "And to sign the contract in three days?",
  "30724": "Was it wonderful that I was misanthropic and sullen?",
  "30725": "Who compels me to this?",
  "30726": "What had she done?",
  "30727": "Do you love him?",
  "30728": "Not even by lightening it, as they lighten an overloaded vessel?",
  "30729": "Is there any other witness?",
  "30730": "Do you think I am so poor and short of clothes, or that I have so few cloaks and as to be unable to find comfortable beds both for myself and for my guests?",
  "30731": "Meg, shall we ever learn to talk less?",
  "30732": "What then, when that's once done?",
  "30733": "Then why did you come here, my dear?",
  "30734": "Why should my courtesie to these knights go all for naught?",
  "30735": "Was I, then, a monster, a blot upon the earth, from which all men fled and whom all men disowned?",
  "30736": "Could the latter for a moment suppose that the son would not offer the best part to the father?",
  "30737": "Why should she be sorry?",
  "30738": "And so?",
  "30739": "Seek introductions, draw petitions up?",
  "30740": "How do we know what is at the bottom of his sudden interest in you?",
  "30741": "Wherefore?",
  "30742": "How do you account for this?",
  "30743": "And on what occasions have such favors been bestowed upon you?",
  "30744": "Do you think that will be really necessary?",
  "30745": "And where the prudence now that awed mankind?",
  "30746": "What will the ladies take for breakfast?",
  "30747": "Where did you learn how I speak of others?",
  "30748": "Does it hurt you so much?",
  "30749": "You are not angry with me?",
  "30750": "What if her interest in him were not so entirely that of a relative as it had formerly been?",
  "30751": "Did you see them off, before you came away?",
  "30752": "What on earth are we to do with him?",
  "30753": "Does it consist in the greater security afforded by a greater variety of parties, against the event of any one party being able to outnumber and oppress the rest?",
  "30754": "Should you like to sleep?",
  "30755": "Why, it may be asked, has the supposed creative force produced bats and no other mammals on remote islands?",
  "30756": "Should he not have a regard for his health and efficiency?",
  "30757": "Shall I tell you each ornament of your toilet?",
  "30758": "How does he get it, then?",
  "30759": "Can it be believed that they would thus act to no purpose during their courtship?",
  "30760": "How know you this man has?",
  "30761": "And as it is to so go at all events, may we not agree that the sooner the better?",
  "30762": "And why were you not willing?",
  "30763": "May I suppose that you have this distinction of the visible and intelligible fixed in your mind?",
  "30764": "What's the good of getting away?",
  "30765": "Is it not adherence to the old and tried, against the new and untried?",
  "30766": "What can I do?",
  "30767": "Are or are not our interests conflicting?",
  "30768": "And by whom were they recommended to you?",
  "30769": "Paid according to the labor that they had performed, of what could they complain?",
  "30770": "And if it is proper to demand proof that justice should be done and the truth spoken, why may one not demand proof that men should be prudent and benevolent?",
  "30771": "What would his guards think if they heard him shout like a madman?",
  "30772": "How about the lion and the lioness?",
  "30773": "Does the reader wish to know where the majority of the songs of the galleys, those refrains called in the special vocabulary lirlonfa, have had their birth?",
  "30774": "Had they been heard?",
  "30775": "You are pleased it is a girl?",
  "30776": "Why should not schools be established, a comfortable hotel be erected, a church be built?",
  "30777": "What the devil is the meaning of all this?",
  "30778": "I suppose your people will be here to meet you?",
  "30779": "What could hinder the poor canoe, followed by sea and watched from the shore, from succumbing before the end of the day?",
  "30780": "The lord of the soil has all wefts and strays here, has he not?",
  "30781": "When will he be able to be moved?",
  "30782": "What is the matter, then?",
  "30783": "Then this child is not yours?",
  "30784": "What is to be done, then?",
  "30785": "Are you on public, or private business?",
  "30786": "But why did you change your purpose?",
  "30787": "What branch of human affairs is there in which these sparks of individual spirit have not made their appearance, surmounting all formal considerations?",
  "30788": "Incense?",
  "30789": "That so?",
  "30790": "That one?",
  "30791": "Was there an accident?",
  "30792": "May it be?",
  "30793": "Is it common sense, I ask you, to leave up windows which shut out all the daylight, and even confuse the eyes by throwing patches of colour, to which I should be hard put to it to give a name, on a floor in which there are not two slabs on the same level?",
  "30794": "Have you a name, then?",
  "30795": "You're not getting into a state, are you?",
  "30796": "But did you ever like knocking about in such discomfort?",
  "30797": "Where was it to come from?",
  "30798": "How did he manage it?",
  "30799": "Now then, what is it, my young woman?",
  "30800": "What can we do for you?",
  "30801": "What commission is this you give me, and what do you charge me to tell his majesty, monsieur?",
  "30802": "It's capital for us here, but what of him?",
  "30803": "Where, where?",
  "30804": "Why are you not so now?",
  "30805": "I should?",
  "30806": "What then would be those convulsed regions upon which we were advancing, regions subject to the dire phenomena of eruptions, the offspring of volcanic explosions and subterranean convulsions?",
  "30807": "Are not you bruised, and cut over your chest and shoulders?",
  "30808": "Ask we what makes one keep, and one bestow?",
  "30809": "What song?",
  "30810": "How did you find out that?",
  "30811": "Are you sure she's married?",
  "30812": "So why should I not stay at his house?",
  "30813": "Will we play our part well?",
  "30814": "Can you not see the hint there is in the practice to such as go searching for secrets?",
  "30815": "You truly wish me to go?",
  "30816": "But then you yourself are known to others?",
  "30817": "And who thus advised you?",
  "30818": "Well, have you any news?",
  "30819": "Drunk or mad?",
  "30820": "Can you not use your eyes?",
  "30821": "Where, then, shall I look?",
  "30822": "Is it not marvelous?",
  "30823": "Is it best for you to injure your prospects for such a voluptuous, idle woman as that?",
  "30824": "But what's the good of them?",
  "30825": "How was he to rouse her?",
  "30826": "Can I bring the dead to life again?",
  "30827": "Am I quite mistaken, or have we returned to the surface of the earth?",
  "30828": "What does he keep reading philosophy of some sort for all this year?",
  "30829": "How's one to rent it nowadays?",
  "30830": "But which system shall be adopted?",
  "30831": "May I ask what that was?",
  "30832": "Exile yourself, did you say?",
  "30833": "What the devil does he want with me?",
  "30834": "And did you not remonstrate against such infamy?",
  "30835": "Does she remind your highness of any one?",
  "30836": "Who, then, are you?",
  "30837": "And is this his mark?",
  "30838": "My wife?",
  "30839": "What was the aim of that visit?",
  "30840": "When did you come?",
  "30841": "Where is your fellow?",
  "30842": "You did not like it, papa?",
  "30843": "Jugwater?",
  "30844": "How you know dat?",
  "30845": "Are you sorry for our agreement?",
  "30846": "Is that the only comment you can find to make?",
  "30847": "What do you mean by so much the worse?",
  "30848": "Why, doctor, can you light up such darkness as this?",
  "30849": "Salvation of what?",
  "30850": "Shall I speak to him?",
  "30851": "Where would he make himself a prisoner and how?",
  "30852": "Did ever anybody hear the like ?",
  "30853": "How did it come about?",
  "30854": "But who done it?",
  "30855": "Have you recognised him, monsieur?",
  "30856": "Must one then curse immediately, when one doth not love?",
  "30857": "And why is that?",
  "30858": "What of the hunting, hunter bold?",
  "30859": "Who's equal to the place?",

  "32652": "Just what could he do?",
  "32653": "What would you ha' me do?",
  "32654": "How can you require faith of the people, when under their own eyes the court turns faith to ridicule, and when infidels find at court aid and protection?",
  "32655": "But why any proclamation on this subject?",
  "32656": "Well, where shall I begin?",

  "33314": "What have I been waiting for?",
  "33315": "Morrel?",
  "33316": "Or what does she mean?",
  "33317": "Has he got the financial basis arranged then?",
  "33318": "A little?",
  "33319": "Who goes there, yourselves?",
  "33320": "Will nothing of it remain?",

  "33340": "Are you superhuman?",
  "33341": "But what good effect can the latter mode of worship have on the moral conduct of a rational being?",
  "33342": "Why, how, when my money is gone, my complexion gone, my life gone, and my slipper gone?",
  "33343": "Do we desire to make such ruthless combinations and monopolies lawful?",
  "33344": "Whose sword?",
  "33345": "There, do you hear?",
  "33346": "You do believe in my grandmother, then?",

  "33593": "Oh, is he?",
  "33594": "Therefore you kept your visit to yourself last night?",
  "33595": "When you sat down on that chair yesterday, did you do so in order to conceal some object which would have shown who had been in the room?",
  "33596": "Does she want to marry again?",
  "33597": "How can you ask such funny questions?",
  "33598": "No, why should it?",
  "33599": "And if she did, would he acknowledge her?",
  "33600": "Why could one not see into people's souls?",
  "33601": "Might it not be better to write first, and say that she was going?",
  "33602": "And, consequently, at what moment ought it to be discharged in order that it may touch the moon at a particular point?",
  "33603": "That is only for their steps, of course?",
  "33604": "Its susceptibility of being produced?",
  "33605": "Does not this pierce your grandfather's territory?",
  "33606": "Then your worship understands rhyming too?",
  "33607": "None?",
  "33608": "Was this to be given up?",
  "33609": "Why are you calling the chickens?",
  "33610": "Did you ever see anything so wonderful?",
  "33611": "Why do you want to frighten us?",
  "33612": "So how can I suppose you a flirt?",
  "33613": "What shall we do about that?",
  "33614": "But how can you go alone?",
  "33615": "How long should I have to hold out?",
  "33616": "Surely, if she's willing, you must wish it as much as I?",
  "33617": "Do you hear, missy?",
  "33618": "Do you not violate and disregard your oath?",
  "33619": "Where have you travelled?",
  "33620": "How many scores have you?",
  "33621": "When did this change take place?",
  "33622": "Did he wish to reach the pole?",
  "33623": "Do you call that a rational system?",
  "33624": "Now how on earth am I to announce a man like that?",
  "33625": "Why do you forbid us to walk abroad or to be caught peeping out?",
  "33626": "You think he'll cut up rough?",
  "33627": "Jobson?",
  "33628": "Doth shame not fill your parents' hearts?",
  "33629": "Do you regret them?",
  "33630": "Has he turned up?",
  "33631": "Establish a tariff of prices and wages, and fix the value of things by sovereign authority?",

  "33633": "Where were the pirates now?",
  "33634": "May we be allowed to imagine the minds of men everywhere working together during many ages for the completion of our knowledge?",
  "33635": "You did not go with her?",
  "33636": "Whatever can that be?",
  "33637": "Well, you do not answer, cardinal, what do you think about it?",
  "33638": "Do you notice that it lies at the easterly end of a large lake?",
  "33639": "What does it matter whether they are true if they are wrong?",
  "33640": "Vozdvizhenskoe, the manor house?",
  "33641": "But why are apologies needed?",
  "33642": "Do you know if there is anything in being brought up by hand that ought to make people who are brought up that way better than other people?",
  "33643": "In a word, have you, dear madam, any ladies on your list, whose services might be made available to my kind friend and neighbour?",
  "33644": "Did you ever meet one of them, or do you find any of their books securing the respectful attention of those competent to judge concerning them?",
  "33645": "Whose portmanteau?",
  "33646": "No what?",
  "33647": "But why not up to now?",
  "33648": "What could be his intentions towards him?",
  "33649": "Was it well done, sir, if you're upon that subject, to deliver what I entrusted to yourself, to the care of another sir?",
  "33650": "Alas, was THIS perhaps the higher man whose cry I heard?",
  "33651": "Heah him crowin' now?",
  "33652": "And have no doubt searched all the huts until you came to this one?",
  "33653": "Do you possess this knowledge?",
  "33654": "I often told you that?",
  "33655": "What can have induced him to behave so cruelly?",
  "33656": "Why should I be surprised?",
  "33657": "Was there any hope there?",
  "33658": "What's the use of thunder?",
  "33659": "But who should negociate?",
  "33660": "How could we do less?",
  "33661": "That being so, monseigneur, what is it?",
  "33662": "What shall I do with it?",
  "33663": "How then is it that such vast classes of mankind as are distinguished by the appellation of the vulgar, or the ignorant mob, are so numerous in all old countries?",
  "33664": "About myself, sir?",
  "33665": "Is she the same that I left her?",
  "33666": "And the chausses?",
  "33667": "Or if it had, what then?",
  "33668": "Will that happy time ever return?",
  "33669": "Shall I ever have the courage to carry it through?",
  "33670": "Was it politics, then, or was it a woman?",
  "33671": "Well, my dear, what are you doing here?",
  "33672": "Am I to suppose that this capricious tone is serious?",
  "33673": "What can they give?",
  "33674": "Nor of an astral plane?",
  "33675": "Matthew, did you ever study geometry when you went to school?",
  "33676": "Are we sure of victory?",
  "33677": "How could the politics of an experienced man of the world be those of an ardent young student?",
  "33678": "No one came and disturbed us, I suppose?",
  "33679": "What, you are desirous of quitting my service, monsieur?",
  "33680": "Now do you really imagine that I could have survived all these years, if I had led a public life, supposing that like a good man I had always maintained the right and had made justice, as I ought, the first thing?",
  "33681": "Who shall say?",
  "33682": "And who are the rest of them?",
  "33683": "How does it not exist, when a man risks dying a terrible death?",
  "33684": "But what could it be?",
  "33685": "He will not dare touch the treasure, will he?",
  "33686": "What good is religion if it collapses under calamity?",
  "33687": "But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject?",
  "33688": "Why should I not die if I wish?",
  "33689": "Is there anything else?",
  "33690": "Was it giddiness, or worse still, suffocation, caused by the high temperature?",
  "33691": "Is it far in the cave?",
  "33692": "But what do you want of one?",
  "33693": "That is some distance away?",
  "33694": "Am I about to do it?",
  "33695": "Is not to have lost the truth an evil, and to possess the truth a good?",

  "33700": "Do you remember we used to go up there?",
  "33701": "Should he make himself known to them?",
  "33702": "Would you like such a post?",
  "33703": "When did you say you paid this call?",
  "33704": "You quite understand?",
  "33705": "Got any supper for a hungry man?",
  "33706": "What would you do to me?",
  "33707": "Why these churches and this singing and this humbug?",
  "33708": "Why do you speak in such a strange way?",
  "33709": "So, where, where was it?",
  "33710": "And you would like your boy's to be the same?",
  "33711": "Before the music or after?",
  "33712": "Why have I never taken part in a review?",
  "33713": "Wherefore should I beware?",
  "33714": "Is it true what the servant man said?",
  "33715": "Did you do it on your own responsibility?",
  "33716": "Will you have gold or silver?",
  "33717": "Should I not appear a most arrogant and shallow coxcomb if I gravely represented that there was any danger of her falling in love with me?",
  "33718": "What are you about there?",
  "33719": "What does it mean to my future?",
  "33720": "What boots it to say more?",
  "33721": "Now is there, then, no kind of oil which is capable of diminishing this friction?",
  "33722": "You have seen the stranger?",
  "33723": "Banns will do?",
  "33724": "And by whom was your wife abducted?",
  "33725": "What name, then, shall we give to the darkness of hell which is to last not for three days alone but for all eternity?",
  "33726": "Ah, what does it all mean?",
  "33727": "Have a wife?",
  "33728": "Do you see me today?",
  "33729": "Who else could lay it there save you or me?",
  "33730": "Why would they not be gone?",
  "33731": "Or, after all, they may be in the right, and poets do really know the things about which they seem to the many to speak so well?",
  "33732": "But would any of your guardians think or speak of any other guardian as a stranger?",
  "33733": "Do you see here this little bunch, to which they are going to give t'other wrench?",
  "33734": "What do you know about it?",
  "33735": "Why, by your silence, have you unchained egoism within me?",
  "33736": "Then why are you so ruffled?",
  "33737": "And why no arrest?",
  "33738": "Is it becoming a philosopher to alter his method of reasoning, and run from one principle to its contrary, according to the particular phaenomenon, which he would explain?",
  "33739": "Where did you get that scratch?",
  "33740": "Should I, if I had a wife, suffer myself to be thus passionately carried to and fro with the stream of her humour, and neglect my deepest affairs, to serve her affections?",
  "33741": "But what do you suppose you are in the world for?",
  "33742": "Snivelling again?",
  "33743": "Three good suits, say you?",
  "33744": "Nor the general?",
  "33745": "Mina, dear what is it?",
  "33746": "How long is it now before daylight?",
  "33747": "Do you know what is done then?",
  "33748": "Is it a volcano?",
  "33749": "Have you been to look at the pictures?",
  "33750": "I do not think that this counting is constitutionally essential to the election, but how are we to proceed in the absence of it?",
  "33751": "These things happened so often at balls, and why not by the morning light, when the complexion showed all the better for it?",
  "33752": "Then you turn me away?",
  "33753": "Do you keep a journal?",
  "33754": "Does it not bear the same relation to it as the motions upon a ship to the motion of the ship itself?",
  "33755": "What is he doing here?",
  "33756": "How, said I?",
  "33757": "A special guard about the castle, in which your lodging is to be, is it not?",

  "33760": "What, will he hang himself?",
  "33761": "And the silver?",
  "33762": "How did he come to consider that he ought to be good and ought not to be bad?",
  "33763": "Secondly, will not a movement of our army be a relief to the cavalry, compelling the enemy to concentrate instead of foraging in squads everywhere?",
  "33764": "Small, what will it be?",
  "33765": "What is going to happen?",
  "33766": "What did you come for?",
  "33767": "How long did the queen remain out of the chamber?",
  "33768": "Do you accept the bargain?",
  "33769": "And we have admitted, I said, that the good of each art is specially confined to the art?",
  "33770": "And you think there was something of this sort here, do you?",
  "33771": "And she became what you called your wife?",
  "33772": "But what I want to know is, who shifted the carpet, and why?",
  "33773": "How on earth did you know that?",
  "33774": "Would you advise that the authority be given him?",
  "33775": "Well, and what do you think, friend?",
  "33776": "If the trees at moonlight sang always so harmoniously?",
  "33777": "Or perhaps they amuse your honor?",
  "33778": "And who else save an executioner would have wished to fill that horrible office?",
  "33779": "On what will the worm feed that is never to die?",
  "33780": "Why should there be one law for men, and another for women?",
  "33781": "If we should wish to retreat, how ought we to pursue?",
  "33782": "Have you washed your hands and face this morning?",
  "33783": "I wonder if the medicine has gone through the same channels in both?",
  "33784": "Then the wit going toward him, asked him what he had got in his knapsack?",
  "33785": "Is not all this obvious?",
  "33786": "Why, what is the matter?",
  "33787": "Is it a heron or a swan?",
  "33788": "Either afield or here has he been seen?",
  "33789": "Where is my son?",
  "33790": "And, indeed, why do I relate these particular calamities?",
  "33791": "Are you foolish enough to believe that it's done for the public?",
  "33792": "Where did you grow?",
  "33793": "What's the matter with him?",
  "33794": "What will you have?",
  "33795": "Who means the smith any harm?",
  "33796": "But the king is king, I suppose?",
  "33797": "What did you talk about?",
  "33798": "Why does the king set me at liberty?",
  "33799": "Who is there so much his country's enemy, or so unmanly, and so desirous of living, as not to repent that he is still alive?",
  "33800": "You'll hev to wait till you see your pa to reward me, then?",
  "33801": "Did you give my note?",
  "33802": "Where's your curls, gal?",
  "33803": "And whether you did not submit to be coughed and groaned down in the very first debate of the session, and have since made no effort to effect a reform in this respect?",
  "33804": "Did he dread, that after having touched him with his icy hand, he would still suffer him to linger upon earth?",
  "33805": "But nothing that might not be sent to a pattern young lady?",
  "33806": "How can I have the conscience to marry after having driven two women to their deaths?",
  "33807": "Why is it?",

  "33811": "And how, pray, could due participation be obtained, if there were no removals?",
  "33812": "Thinking of more important matters, I forget where you said he lived?",
  "33813": "But what chanced next?",
  "33814": "And what were his first words?",
  "33815": "Can we conclude a treaty with the sea?",
  "33816": "Who is that tub there?",
  "33817": "And what are they doing, all these courtiers?",
  "33818": "Are you, sir knight, in love perchance?",
  "33819": "What does that grave smile signify?",
  "33820": "I expect you hurt yourself when you fell down?",
  "33821": "But you, I presume, have decided to assert your pretensions viva voce?",
  "33822": "Do you wish to hear what I have to say?",
  "33823": "Where the devil have the leg bands been shoved to?",
  "33824": "What became of them, deprived of the dear garden of former days, with its mazes, its odor of the past, and the graceful windings of its hedges?",
  "33825": "What be they?",
  "33826": "Do you know what that is?",
  "33827": "Was it indeed such spiritual guidance that was coming to me in my sleep?",
  "33828": "Are you going to spend your life saying ought, like the rest of our moralists?",
  "33829": "From what can it proceed?",
  "33830": "Whether he could go into the next street, and open a chemist's shop?",

  "33833": "Have you any business to attend to?",
  "33834": "But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that hole?",
  "33835": "With whom am I going to work the system, allow me to ask?",
  "33836": "What have you got?",
  "33837": "With respect to the employments of a soldier, a senator, and a judge, which are evidently necessary to the community, shall they be allotted to different persons, or shall the same person execute both?",
  "33838": "Who are we ourselves?",
  "33839": "Rather costly, I suppose, my dear, was it not?",
  "33840": "How could I answer her arguments?",
  "33841": "Billie?",
  "33842": "And indeed, what is there in the idea of measuring, and consequently of fixing, value, that is unscientific?",
  "33843": "And do you call a man your friend whom you have only known for eight or ten days?",
  "33844": "And what do you do, sire?",
  "33845": "So, now then, who is this abbot?",
  "33846": "You yourself came only yesterday, you say?",
  "33847": "Was it foreseen?",
  "33848": "Whom was it to?",
  "33849": "Did he know that?",
  "33850": "And when the vault is open?",
  "33851": "Is not truth a treasure think you?",
  "33852": "You quite follow me?",
  "33853": "Did not he pay his son's debts?",
  "33854": "Do you take me for a weasel?",
  "33855": "That will cheer you, will it not?",

  "33875": "Are you sure we are on the right track, lieutenant?",
  "33876": "May not the minor party possess such a superiority of pecuniary resources, of military talents and experience, or of secret succors from foreign powers, as will render it superior also in an appeal to the sword?",
  "33877": "What ideas have they been filling your head with, you young girls of today?",
  "33878": "Was it worth while to wish me to swear this morning that I would mention the appointment to no one?",
  "33879": "Or what is it commonly, that gives us any participation in it, even while alive and present, but our affection and regard to him?",
  "33880": "Could you give me the facts which prompted you to telegraph?",
  "33881": "Tib?",
  "33882": "Will you give me one of the cakes you are carrying?",
  "33883": "And no ba'dy gaieties, I suppose?",
  "33884": "All out?",
  "33885": "Who made it to be like that, a bestial part of the body able to understand bestially and desire bestially?",
  "33886": "Does the court accompany him?",
  "33887": "Are you sure there's nothing you'll want?",
  "33888": "What's the blow now?",
  "33889": "Returning?",
  "33890": "No carriages or horses?",
  "33891": "But to what?",
  "33892": "Where do you feel bad?",
  "33893": "You must guess what I should like best, do you hear?",
  "33894": "What then is the real object of them?",
  "33895": "Is there anything else you wish to retrench or alter, gentlemen?",

  "33902": "And when I tell you that it is my business, mine of right, does that go for nothing with you?",
  "33903": "And yet you were acknowledging a little while ago that knowledge is not the same as opinion?",
  "33904": "Do you not see that society is dissolving, that a spirit of infatuation is carrying us away?",
  "33905": "Well, it's very pleasant to have you back again, and you understand all about art now, eh?",
  "33906": "And would you know what I would do unto him?",
  "33907": "You do not know me?",
  "33908": "But what is there to investigate, sir?",
  "33909": "I may read this?",
  "33910": "But if he should rob you of it?",
  "33911": "Can this be death?",
  "33912": "Did he tell you so?",

  "33917": "What was the question you put to the officer at the gate?",
  "33918": "Could we handle that dumb thing, or would it handle us?",
  "33919": "What, then, was the change which now took place?",
  "33920": "Of what other things have you got hold?",
  "33921": "Do you take it for a printed book, you ignorant fool?",
  "33922": "What earthly right have you to use such language to me?",
  "33923": "And now what is their manner of life, and what sort of a government have they?",
  "33924": "And that one?",
  "33925": "And if we refuse?",
  "33926": "And the young should be trained in both kinds, and we begin with the false?",
  "33927": "Or do you think that my having been unfortunate is a sufficient reason why our relative positions should be changed, and that she should command and I should obey?",
  "33928": "Do you understand what you're saying?",
  "33929": "Have you a boat?",

  "33933": "Fix'd in the heart, how can the heart forget her?",
  "33934": "That young man who was to be burned yesterday, was your son?",
  "33935": "Who can help it?",
  "33936": "How far off?",
  "33937": "You have tied him up well, hein?",
  "33938": "Where got you that wit?",
  "33939": "Then why have you not sung before?",
  "33940": "Could she help giving her hand to the man who had won her heart?",
  "33941": "Then they are saved?",
  "33942": "Why should you not be open with me?",
  "33943": "What is the use of talking of it?",
  "33944": "What do men talk about when they sit out?",
  "33945": "And who are my brethren?",
  "33946": "Who sent you?",
  "33947": "Do you drink?",
  "33948": "You only think?",
  "33949": "And when did it begin?",
  "33950": "Well, have you brought it?",
  "33951": "What are they, your excellency ?",
  "33952": "Who could tell what the future might have in reserve?",

  "33959": "My niece is not with you by any chance?",
  "33960": "Now, what must I give you to agree to this?",
  "33961": "Is it enough?",
  "33962": "A large scale map, I presume?",
  "33963": "What am I accused of?",
  "33964": "Where can he have come from?",
  "33965": "Can any one comprehend such a thing?",
  "33966": "Yours?",
  "33967": "Is he one of them, do you think?",
  "33968": "Did not that king accept of money from our king on this condition, that he should not destroy the city, and yet, contrary to the oath he had taken, he came down to burn the temple?",
  "33969": "You love me, my beautiful queen, and you will weep for me?",
  "33970": "Or a drop of dew?",
  "33971": "Found your way back at last, have you?",
  "33972": "Is he a gentleman?",
  "33973": "What are their names?",
  "33974": "You're not asleep?",
  "33975": "Where are you?",
  "33976": "Indeed?",
  "33977": "Who can wonder that princes should be under such a delusion, when they are encouraged in it by the very persons who suffer from it most cruelly?",
  "33978": "I know it meets your approval?",
  "33979": "Your highness's signature?",
  "33980": "Why so many precautions?",
  "33981": "You have seen how it was fastened about my throat?",
  "33982": "Omen?",
  "33983": "How cast off?",
  "33984": "Why did I not think of bringing provisions?",
  "33985": "Gone into my house?",
  "33986": "Has her case been heard or not?",
  "33987": "Has this action of hers not set me free?",
  "33988": "And who is there, whatever might be their former conduct, that she would think capable of such an attempt, till it were proved against them?",
  "33989": "Who has consoled me in my sorrow but he?",
  "33990": "Do you forgive me?",
  "33991": "Was she not splendid in the last scene?",
  "33992": "And then, what would the doctor have said?",
  "33993": "And you married her at last, notwithstanding the opposition of her family?",
  "33994": "What made you come here?",
  "33995": "Do you see anything?",
  "33996": "Nothing more than two articles of belief?",
  "33997": "How old be these?",
  "33998": "How did they guess that it is help, just help that one wants?",
  "33999": "Can you?",
  "34000": "Is he changed?",
  "34001": "Well, what do you think?",
  "34002": "Sin?",
  "34003": "But who were they whom the sea had drunk?",
  "34004": "What say you, sir?",
  "34005": "Have you changed your mind?",
  "34006": "Now after what manner are they related to ourselves?",
  "34007": "What think you?",
  "34008": "His tale and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be a creature of fine sensations, and did I not as his maker owe him all the portion of happiness that it was in my power to bestow?",
  "34009": "Can I be mistaken?",
  "34010": "HyroQwhich?",
  "34011": "What is it that we really desire?",
  "34012": "You will do me this service, will you not?",
  "34013": "Is that what you did?",
  "34014": "Do you mean danger from this family fiend or do you mean danger from human beings?",
  "34015": "What PUT it dar?",
  "34016": "Actually married?",
  "34017": "Stout of teeth, and strong of tongue?",
  "34018": "What have they done to you?",
  "34019": "How otherwise could he keep himself before the world?",
  "34020": "How do you think a man can make friends unless he keeps a good table?",
  "34021": "Upon what subject, sire?",
  "34022": "What do you advise me?",
  "34023": "Knew who?",
  "34024": "You refuse?",
  "34025": "Who are you that you should take it on yourself to ask such things?",
  "34026": "For how long?",
  "34027": "Or is she at variance with them?",
  "34028": "But where is he?",
  "34029": "What therefore did he mean by these precautions, delays, and mysteries?",
  "34030": "Have I been remiss in anything?",
  "34031": "Will you come with me?",
  "34032": "But he IS handsome?",
  "34033": "What have you done to him?",
  "34034": "They are not identical, then?",
  "34035": "Are we not going to find him?",
  "34036": "As to this terrible person of yours, where is he?",
  "34037": "Why should I stay for her?",
  "34038": "Is it not possible that the emperors established an authority to be consulted by the judges?",
  "34039": "Which way are you walking, may I ask?",
  "34040": "You are the inspector of prisons?",
  "34041": "Is the world filled with tigers and crocodiles?",
  "34042": "Do you live all alone here?",
  "34043": "Suppose the stairs get steeper?",
  "34044": "You have neither of you any doubt as to your son's guilt?",
  "34045": "You have already been assaulted?",
  "34046": "You belong to the gentry?",
  "34047": "An evil huntsman was I?",
  "34048": "What can be the good of weakening a corps by placing the right here, and the left there?",
  "34049": "Shall we take some for breakfast?",
  "34050": "Is it then right to give them a home?",
  "34051": "Well, what would you think?",
  "34052": "Where have they been?",
  "34053": "Can it oblige neighbors to destroy each other?",
  "34054": "This is a surprise, what?",
  "34055": "And why the minute?",
  "34056": "THAT place?",
  "34057": "And have I any right to go and peep under their cloaks to see what is not there?",
  "34058": "And then, sire?",
  "34059": "And what do you think?",
  "34060": "Am I not to read it?",
  "34061": "What was to be done?",
  "34062": "What fell out upon it?",
  "34063": "What els?",
  "34064": "You little coarse monster, what do you think of me now?",
  "34065": "There'll be a rehearsal this afternoon, I suppose, sir?",
  "34066": "What shall I promise?",
  "34067": "I suppose you're making for the hill?",
  "34068": "But is there anything better on earth than that we should love one another?",
  "34069": "You left it somewhere, then, in the meantime?",
  "34070": "What about the little boy?",
  "34071": "Would you say that all men are equal in excellence, or is one man better than another?",
  "34072": "Have you never been anywhere even for a trip?",
  "34073": "And why the missing ring?",
  "34074": "But upon what principle is the discrimination of the places of election to be made, in order to answer the purpose of the meditated preference?",
  "34075": "Get out?",
  "34076": "Whether party, in religion or politics, were observed to be of any weight in the scale of justice?",
  "34077": "Are you ill?",
  "34078": "Did he get well again?",
  "34079": "I guess you expect to raise your bread ready made, dont you?",
  "34080": "How is it, sir?",
  "34081": "How about that now?",
  "34082": "Then your only fear in aiding me to escape is that your fellow mortals may discover your duplicity?",
  "34083": "Are there, then, two parliaments?",
  "34084": "Composing songs for fools to get by heart?",
  "34085": "You really think that?",
  "34086": "There, at home, what do they do?",
  "34087": "Suppose she should come out now, what would you do?",
  "34088": "What will be the end of all this?",
  "34089": "What maidens loth?",
  "34090": "Can you direct me?",
  "34091": "What do you wish me to say to you?",
  "34092": "And was he after all to become a mere stone of stumbling and a rock of offence?",
  "34093": "What is that, mon cher ami?",
  "34094": "Why SHOULD she, of a sudden, at this particular moment, desire to ship you off together and to remain here alone with me?",
  "34095": "Was this strange man glad of this decision?",
  "34096": "Would you like to drink some water?",
  "34097": "I hope you've not been waiting long?",
  "34098": "Will it please your worship to accept of my poor service?",
  "34099": "Hot cakes?",
  "34100": "I hope your hair curls naturally, does it?",
  "34101": "An accident?",
  "34102": "You consider it so?",
  "34103": "Was he thus to think of his father, whose face was always lighted up with pleasure when his boy came near to him, and so rarely bright at any other time?",
  "34104": "Are you afraid now in daylight?",
  "34105": "What is fasting?",
  "34106": "Whither art flying?",
  "34107": "Did you not see it?",
  "34108": "And, finally, what must be done with them when under the ramparts of that town, if we should be able to take them there?",
  "34109": "How do you mean, ask them questions?",
  "34110": "What are you about?",
  "34111": "Is not reason in error as regards advantage?",
  "34112": "Might it not be an excess of speed?",
  "34113": "Head off?",
  "34114": "Have they not a position as citizens of this common country, and have we any power to change that position?",
  "34115": "Is not the midnight brighter?",
  "34116": "And if the entire social structure is built upon this absolute impossibility of property, is it not true that the government under which we live is a chimera, and our present society a utopia?",
  "34117": "How can I find out?",
  "34118": "Studying botany, or is it archaeology?",
  "34119": "How are we going to get into the castle?",
  "34120": "Shift ho?",
  "34121": "Would you mind telling me who or what you think I am?",
  "34122": "So, sir, you've been paying ten per cent for money which you've promised to pay off by mortgaging my land when I'm dead and gone, eh?",
  "34123": "I mean, what did the general say when the purse turned up under the chair?",
  "34124": "I say, why is the king taken prisoner?",
  "34125": "Do we admit the existence of opinion?",
  "34126": "I guess that's enough for any on us, now aint it?",
  "34127": "Then he will tell me, too?",
  "34128": "Who's it from?",
  "34129": "Was he unkind to you?",
  "34130": "And did you ever hear that my father was an avaricious, grasping man?",
  "34131": "What do you see?",
  "34132": "What was feudalism?",
  "34133": "Well, was he very glad?",
  "34134": "Who would ever have believed this?",
  "34135": "What do I make of it?",
  "34136": "What am I to say?",
  "34137": "Are not the inhabitants happy?",
  "34138": "Are we not to follow the man that was born to lead us?",
  "34139": "What have wealth or grandeur to do with happiness?",
  "34140": "In short, why are so many destined to be unlucky and so few to be lucky?",
  "34141": "What else could it be?",
  "34142": "And what have I been thinking of till now?",
  "34143": "Was it you?",
  "34144": "But of what sort?",
  "34145": "Is it possible, then, to make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after separation than before?",
  "34146": "Be there many soldiers hereaway, after us?",
  "34147": "Is not the suppression of these notes my perpetual effort, my undying despair?",
  "34148": "Would he speak them?",
  "34149": "Whom can it injure?",
  "34150": "Well, my lad, and what may you want up here?",
  "34151": "In the daytime?",
  "34152": "Is that loving?",
  "34153": "How cold is it?",
  "34154": "And, finally, would you take the great pains to conceal the body, and yet leave your own stick as a sign that you were the criminal?",
  "34155": "You have given your word, then?",
  "34156": "Is it possible that it is all over?",
  "34157": "When did this change begin?",
  "34158": "You do believe I'm not a hypocrite?",
  "34159": "How are you, mon cher?",
  "34160": "Do you want me to lend you some?",
  "34161": "But of what is he dying?",
  "34162": "What's yours?",
  "34163": "Terrible?",
  "34164": "You're a pianist yourself, I believe?",
  "34165": "What's the good of suggesting anything?",
  "34166": "Had she any plan or idea?",
  "34167": "What does she think about me?",
  "34168": "What place therefore needed purification except the hall and courtyard?",
  "34169": "If it were as you say, what could be sadder than so much ardent labor all in vain?",
  "34170": "In full, or on account?",
  "34171": "What wonder?",
  "34172": "What is the cause of this wonderful difference between the dead particle and the living particle of matter appearing in other respects identical?",
  "34173": "Or shall it vary according to the different formation of the government?",
  "34174": "What was to be done in this horrible dilemma?",
  "34175": "Why should it not be the same with the internal heat?",
  "34176": "Can you see those tracks upon the path?",
  "34177": "Or will she come herself?",
  "34178": "But if any person prefers a kingly government in a state, what is to be done with the king's children?",
  "34179": "At four, then, we may expect you?",
  "34180": "Who is that young man over there?",
  "34181": "Could you go in and persuade your sister to come out?",
  "34182": "Did you know?",
  "34183": "Besides, has he not had his full share of the blessings of mortality?",
  "34184": "Had he been able to swim to shore?",
  "34185": "Taking her down south?",
  "34186": "Are we come to that pass?",
  "34187": "Can you transform them all at once?",
  "34188": "Do I understand that the whole estate is found to have been absorbed in costs?",
  "34189": "Successful with the ladies, then?",
  "34190": "Is this love?",
  "34191": "What is there in them?",
  "34192": "Has she been ill, then?",
  "34193": "What could be the reason of his overpowering terror?",
  "34194": "Do you know that positively?",
  "34195": "And the hotel bill?",
  "34196": "How can you chuck it in like that or shove it under the cord where it'll get rubbed?",
  "34197": "He had no rival?",
  "34198": "Was he in the wars?",
  "34199": "A real father?",
  "34200": "Did escape occur to him?",
  "34201": "Has she been in his service ever since?",
  "34202": "And you yourself, do you love him?",
  "34203": "Who's that?",
  "34204": "Fernand?",
  "34205": "And have you heard from him often?",
  "34206": "Whom have you seen, then?",
  "34207": "But might not a time come when all their science would be at fault?",
  "34208": "Is it supported by REASON?",
  "34209": "But will the sun show himself through this fog?",
  "34210": "Seriously?",
  "34211": "Where are your papers?",
  "34212": "Stew?",
  "34213": "Doth the goldsmith that makes the crown, make the virtue also?",
  "34214": "And yet there is a sense in which the painter also creates a bed?",
  "34215": "You would have done that?",
  "34216": "By what means could inflammation be prevented?",
  "34217": "Whether a profound genius or a sure judgement?",
  "34218": "The telegraph?",
  "34219": "Are there any papers form the office?",
  "34220": "Why the devil, then, do you come to me for advice?",
  "34221": "What had he seen?",
  "34222": "And who knows whether a felicitous and blissful future may not still await us?",
  "34223": "Had his keener powers enabled him to recognize the unknown?",
  "34224": "When you going to start the gang and turn robbers?",
  "34225": "How can I look at you otherwise when I love you?",
  "34226": "Could I have anticipated this treachery?",
  "34227": "Is't not well penned?",
  "34228": "Do you see what swarms of birds are gathering here?",
  "34229": "What's he like?",
  "34230": "I have already recorded sentence of death, five or six times, against the movers of political conspiracies, and who can say how many daggers may be ready sharpened, and only waiting a favorable opportunity to be buried in my heart?",
  "34231": "Then it was not till your return to the ship that you put the letter in the portfolio?",
  "34232": "It seems he addressed the young man first, threatening him with his vengeance for having trespassed on his demesnes, and asking him if he knew in whose presence he stood?",
  "34233": "How could he make the man understand?",
  "34234": "Are you cold?",
  "34235": "How could he spring away with his four legs in the air above him?",
  "34236": "Why do you tie up your bell?",
  "34237": "What was degrading?",
  "34238": "What am I fit for?",
  "34239": "In that respect, what made you of him?",
  "34240": "Would you like me to show you?",
  "34241": "What difference does it make?",
  "34242": "Well, would you like to look round the cells now?",
  "34243": "Whatever have I done?",
  "34244": "Am I not encompassed with the banners of a potent and invincible army?",
  "34245": "What has that are critter done that he should be sold arter that fashion?",
  "34246": "Of her answer?",
  "34247": "Where is the soap industry concentrated?",
  "34248": "What do you live on?",
  "34249": "Did the young man recognize that face by the light of the lantern in his tilbury, or was he merely struck with the horrible appearance of his interrogator?",
  "34250": "And your father?",
  "34251": "What are you all standing up for, gentlemen?",
  "34252": "Which were we to take?",
  "34253": "Oh, why so?",
  "34254": "But who will give me notice?",
  "34255": "But then, why did he marry her?",
  "34256": "Where does this path lead to?",
  "34257": "But the willow bark?",
  "34258": "Can it have been only a momentary mood, and will it pass and leave no trace?",
  "34259": "Why did he not tell them he knew nothing about this affair?",
  "34260": "Was it true what that man said?",
  "34261": "Well, how am I so?",
  "34262": "Tell me also about my father, and the son whom I left behind me, is my property still in their hands, or has some one else got hold of it, who thinks that I shall not return to claim it?",
  "34263": "Does he not look like a clown?",
  "34264": "Would you have acted differently, captain?",
  "34265": "We get on very well together, you and I, and I've not behaved badly to you, have I?",
  "34266": "Is it likely I would try to make her what I am myself, knowing what I am myself, so well?",
  "34267": "Will you tell us that?",
  "34268": "Why did he detain her?",
  "34269": "Did it not measure about six yards?",
  "34270": "This is the church where she attends mass, is it not?",
  "34271": "Now that I feel nothing, it has stopped, has perhaps gone down again into its darkness, from which who can say whether it will ever rise?",
  "34272": "Are you making fun of me?",
  "34273": "What is it that I can do then?",
  "34274": "And why, sire?",
  "34275": "Is the ocean spread above our heads?",
  "34276": "And why presently?",
  "34277": "Was it known how it originated?",
  "34278": "Is not that sufficient?",
  "34279": "Have you ever had any such feeling?",
  "34280": "Living or dead?",
  "34281": "What DO you mean?",
  "34282": "What did he say to her?",
  "34283": "An fyre?",
  "34284": "Is she going by herself?",
  "34285": "But why do you wish to go back to the island?",
  "34286": "Are there not some which not only have not been included but cannot possibly be included under any classification?",
  "34287": "Was he?",
  "34288": "How can I advise him?",
  "34289": "Doth not he die like a good fellow that dies with a stiff catso?",
  "34290": "Could I behold this and live?",
  "34291": "What document?",
  "34292": "What could she say?",
  "34293": "Is it as bad as that?",
  "34294": "Was that all that prevented you?",
  "34295": "You ate it?",
  "34296": "These then may be truly said to be the ends of these organs?",
  "34297": "Who are the company?",
  "34298": "Timbuctoo?",
  "34299": "What motive have you in your mind?",
  "34300": "What was the cause of your quarrel?",
  "34301": "Every day?",
  "34302": "Is this a juggle?",
  "34303": "What did I hear?",
  "34304": "How be I to keep him from it, if he chooses?",
  "34305": "What means this outcry?",
  "34306": "What must I tell?",
  "34307": "Do you really look for anything when you go out?",
  "34308": "Oh, my brethren, is not everything AT PRESENT IN FLUX?",
  "34309": "We follow the vein, we mine and accumulate our treasure, but who can tell which way the vein may trend?",
  "34310": "Impossible?",
  "34311": "And he who lives well is blessed and happy, and he who lives ill the reverse of happy?",
  "34312": "Do you never catch cold?",
  "34313": "At it again?",
  "34314": "I married?",
  "34315": "In this flowing stream then, on which there is no abiding, what is there of the things which hurry by on which a man would set a high price?",
  "34316": "If this be so, how can I, who love you, wish for such a marriage?",
  "34317": "What has happened, dear lady?",
  "34318": "Why is all this, except from the utter ignorance as to the simplest laws of their own animal life, which prevails among even the most highly educated persons in this country?",
  "34319": "Sure he saw the prisoner with these lists?",
  "34320": "Why do you not come back to her?",
  "34321": "Why was this man off here alone?",
  "34322": "In what has the chevalier been inconsiderate enough to displease your majesty?",
  "34323": "And why not, captain?",
  "34324": "How, then, shall we find the relation between two unknowns which, according to political economy, cannot be determined?",
  "34325": "Where are you taking him at that speed?",
  "34326": "Where are the other papers?",
  "34327": "Can he box?",
  "34328": "And why had she made it so cold?",
  "34329": "By what means shall we fortify against it?",
  "34330": "Do you remember your promise yesterday to give me a kiss?",
  "34331": "What is a guardian for?",
  "34332": "You swear to me, my father, that no danger threatens him if he comes?",
  "34333": "Do you not think that there are things which you cannot understand, and yet which are, that some people see things that others cannot?",
  "34334": "How could that be, if the cost of the national workshops is higher than that of the free workshops?",
  "34335": "Well then, you must know I mean have you had any desire to do what cannot be avoided?",
  "34336": "On what, then, have you relied, legislators?",
  "34337": "Have you never felt one little bit of what you used to feel when we were at the dairy?",
  "34338": "Is no distinction to be made in the intensity of desires?",
  "34339": "Willoughby, where was your heart when you wrote those words?",
  "34340": "Can I do more?",
  "34341": "Are these her rooms?",
  "34342": "What is all human conduct but the daily and hourly sale of our souls for trifles?",
  "34343": "Is it not very reasonable, therefore, she should cultivate both?",
  "34344": "Could you help us at all?",
  "34345": "You are then the person who requested to meet me here at this unusual hour?",
  "34346": "Do you know that mood when one could scream because a mat is crooked?",

  "35470": "Do you doubt it?",
  "35471": "But why not, my dear?",
  "35472": "But how did he account for it?",
  "35473": "Danae means a shower of gold, does it not?",

  "35485": "And what do you?",
  "35486": "Are they or their descendants to embrace our faith?",
  "35487": "Where is the church?",
  "35488": "Nor by reason of a knowledge which advises about brazen pots, I said, nor as possessing any other similar knowledge?",
  "35489": "Who shall judge of the continuance of the danger?",
  "35490": "Are you sure we are alone?",
  "35491": "Are you quite sure that this is a man, or that he has ever been one?",

  "35501": "Their feet?",
  "35502": "The thing was proven upon him?",
  "35503": "Do you feel rather easier?",
  "35504": "Then, for all your valour, you would save your life?",
  "35505": "Guilty of what?",
  "35506": "Why, is any day old and new?",
  "35507": "Nor would you say that medicine is the art of receiving pay because a man takes fees when he is engaged in healing?",
  "35508": "You have, at least, money to receive, as you have an order?",
  "35509": "How she does?",

  "36307": "How do you know she has?",
  "36308": "It was running wild after the girls may be?",
  "36309": "He sent some one?",
  "36310": "Who would know so well as you how to teach the lesson of endurance to others?",
  "36311": "Did I not think so?",
  "36312": "By making them stronger for each other's aid, will you make her less willing to discharge a lighter than a greater responsibility?",
  "36313": "But when your father comes back tomorrow what am I to tell him?",
  "36314": "Oh, do you then know him?",
  "36315": "And you think it quite right?",
  "36316": "Then, again, within the city, how will they exchange their productions?",
  "36317": "Believe what?",
  "36318": "Perhaps, concerned only for his imminent doom, he had not had sincere sorrow for his sin?",
  "36319": "How can we help?",
  "36320": "How could a man like him be expected to have any pleasure in such a discovery?",
  "36321": "So it was YOUR cry of distress that I heard?",
  "36322": "But do you suppose that if I had been I should have asked you to let me go and live with him?",
  "36323": "Are you coming?",
  "36324": "Is it strife?",
  "36325": "What needs he the defence this arm can make?",
  "36326": "Do I understand it?",
  "36327": "What about the general?",
  "36328": "Your brother was, I believe, unmarried, was he not?",
  "36329": "Less pedigree?",
  "36330": "What was then to be done?",
  "36331": "Why did not you all learn?",
  "36332": "Does it apply well to my suit?",
  "36333": "What does he think I can do with his five francs?",
  "36334": "What lunacy are you talking?",
  "36335": "How could he hope ever to grow up to be as good and wise as they, or even tolerably good and wise?",
  "36336": "Lie down?",
  "36337": "More smart, is it?",
  "36338": "Can it be with me?",
  "36339": "Lord?",
  "36340": "What is the matter with you that you know them?",
  "36341": "What does he mean by using a shotgun when silence was his one chance of escape?",
  "36342": "Is the time ripe now?",
  "36343": "But why are we standing here?",
  "36344": "But who knows, madam, but somebody that shall be nameless would like me best with all my little finery about me?",
  "36345": "Why had he wasted his time hunting?",
  "36346": "What is there in your mind?",
  "36347": "You really love, then, no lady at this court?",
  "36348": "Will she be safe over there?",
  "36349": "Have you a mind to teach the beavers to sing?",
  "36350": "Why was this?",
  "36351": "What have you got to say next?",
  "36352": "How soon can he be here?",
  "36353": "How you come to fall out?",
  "36354": "Will he come again?",
  "36355": "Can you provide that they shall be separated at bed and board?",
  "36356": "Did anything happen this time?",
  "36357": "Where does my father get all that iron rust from?",
  "36358": "And you choose that time for grazing?",
  "36359": "If I could do that, simpleton, where would the danger be?",
  "36360": "A natural death is better than an artificial life, surely?",
  "36361": "Children dear, were we long alone?",
  "36362": "Is this number seven?",
  "36363": "Why do you suppose that I should look severely on your affection for that young man?",
  "36364": "Is this a weather to send benevolence?",
  "36365": "Who was the criminal, then?",
  "36366": "And what reason is that?",
  "36367": "Where was the difficulty?",
  "36368": "What do I care about blood?",
  "36369": "What is that stupid fellow troubling himself about?",
  "36370": "Is this a preparation for immortality?",
  "36371": "Had I ever seen so much loathing and pale horror on one countenance?",
  "36372": "When shall we start?",
  "36373": "Did I, sir?",
  "36374": "And who can tell when these happy hours may return?",
  "36375": "We were saying that the parents should be in the prime of life?",
  "36376": "Are these no capital?",
  "36377": "Why did I at once experience a shock?",
  "36378": "Cannot I cut off the part and restore you by a sweat bath?",
  "36379": "Should art be taken seriously?",
  "36380": "But how are you to get that balance?",
  "36381": "Why this hostility of interests?",
  "36382": "What availed the noise and bustle of cheerful morning, which penetrated even there, to him?",
  "36383": "When shall it be?",
  "36384": "Can you turn a strain to the ladies, sir?",
  "36385": "Over whom?",
  "36386": "Would not jets of boiling water, constantly injected by the pumps, raise the temperature in this part and stay the congelation?",
  "36387": "What difference would that make?",
  "36388": "Or look you I should play the orator?",
  "36389": "Doth not wealth satiate, and become nauseous, and no longer serve to satisfy or pleasure, or to buy an hour's peace of mind?",
  "36390": "You were going to say, thirdly?",
  "36391": "Into a new light?",
  "36392": "Did she want to stay at home?",
  "36393": "Which building?",
  "36394": "But why should I consort, I, a brave man, with the abominable?",
  "36395": "Can you guess, now, what this is?",
  "36396": "Suppose you were a foundling and were shown our faith and yours, and asked for which you would decide, which would you choose?",
  "36397": "And how on earth would she ever manage to hold her tongue during school hours?",
  "36398": "Are we afraid of foreign gold?",
  "36399": "Was it a double tooth, hey?",
  "36400": "And how can it all be done by daybreak?",
  "36401": "After these, what resentment can remain in the heart?",
  "36402": "But if she has so absolutely failed, what then had she done?",
  "36403": "And you remember, too, the period when he began to grow fatter?",
  "36404": "What is nature?",
  "36405": "What was it that was borne in upon my mind when she stood still and looked attentively at me?",
  "36406": "And you're not frightened?",
  "36407": "Are you a politician, friend?",
  "36408": "Have you not got all the plants and stones you want?",
  "36409": "What time was it?",
  "36410": "Is it obeying your husband to disobey him on the wital subject of his business?",
  "36411": "On what grounds?",
  "36412": "What is your address in the country?",
  "36413": "How will he ever know the truth, since I shall not tell him of it?",
  "36414": "It was he who rescued you?",
  "36415": "What, for instance, do you mean by all that humbug about the soul?",
  "36416": "Cannot I answer your purpose?",
  "36417": "To whom did he give up his sword?",
  "36418": "Would not that be a sacrifice of higher prospects for you?",
  "36419": "Say, what can cause such impotence of mind?",
  "36420": "But the doctor?",
  "36421": "What business have I with this pipe?",
  "36422": "You have a recipe for it?",
  "36423": "But she?",
  "36424": "Do you know anything about fortifications?",
  "36425": "Is there no merit in repentance?",
  "36426": "What became of you, dear?",
  "36427": "Well, what is to be done, mademoiselle, when so many wills are leagued against me?",
  "36428": "And besides, what is truth to us but the continuous progress of our mind from poetry to prose?",
  "36429": "Is there any point to which you would wish to draw my attention?",
  "36430": "Shall we go in?",
  "36431": "And how would I do it, think you?",
  "36432": "At least we can have a window?",
  "36433": "Must one die like a dog?",
  "36434": "What does that wagon contain?",
  "36435": "What's the matter with your leg?",
  "36436": "Might not some curious eye fasten on it, and divine its contents?",
  "36437": "What is the difference?",
  "36438": "Who's the other fool?",
  "36439": "Well, do you understand, monsieur?",
  "36440": "Now, how does a man search a revolving bookcase?",
  "36441": "On what ground do you venture to interfere with me, messieurs?",
  "36442": "What ails ye, man?",
  "36443": "What would be your surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness?",
  "36444": "In the office?",
  "36445": "Ah, precious one, why does your lover live to see you dead?",
  "36446": "Could she be deceived as to the meaning of this?",
  "36447": "Do you really mean to say that that leg of yours is better already?",
  "36448": "Do you not think perhaps that some of the shortcoming lies with yourself?",
  "36449": "How can that be, monsieur?",
  "36450": "And suppose he can obtain his desires, is that so bad as cutting her throat?",
  "36451": "Look here, do you intend to take up you abode with us?",
  "36452": "What do you want to drink now?",
  "36453": "Carey?",
  "36454": "Happy?",
  "36455": "How old are you?",
  "36456": "Is it such as they that we are to follow?",
  "36457": "Do you not think that I also long for forgetfulness?",
  "36458": "What is the captain about?",
  "36459": "Why had he not let them know that he was still working on the case?",
  "36460": "A ghost?",
  "36461": "Will you work?",
  "36462": "Where have you been, this long, long while?",
  "36463": "What might not have happened to men?",
  "36464": "With what color of propriety could the force necessary for defense be limited by those who cannot limit the force of offense?",
  "36465": "Is it bright?",
  "36466": "How could I know he hated him?",
  "36467": "And all this, for what, I pray?",
  "36468": "Who told you that I loved him?",
  "36469": "Is that what you meant?",
  "36470": "And did I do it for my country's sake?",
  "36471": "But what exactly am I to tell you about them?",
  "36472": "Now where will it be agreeable to you that we hold our conference?",
  "36473": "Why does fate play such tricks with poor, helpless worms?",
  "36474": "Have you ever seen a snake rise up on your path?",
  "36475": "Do passive indolent women make the best wives?",
  "36476": "What would you feel, if a man were faithless to you?",
  "36477": "Has a dog money?",
  "36478": "What do you want there?",
  "36479": "Eliza, girl, what ails you today?",
  "36480": "Is there fate amongst us still, send down from the pagan world of old, that such things must be, and in such way?",
  "36481": "Then you had some grounds for supposing he might be the culprit?",
  "36482": "How on earth did you manage to become the favorite of the king, you who have never spoken to him more than twice in your life?",
  "36483": "And your second wish?",
  "36484": "If the view from below had been most interesting and singular, how shall I describe its appearance as seen from above?",
  "36485": "Not so dusty, what?",
  "36486": "Till death itself?",
  "36487": "To defend him would be to accuse herself, would it not?",
  "36488": "But do you think it will rise?",
  "36489": "As bad as all that?",
  "36490": "May it not be spoken except in private?",
  "36491": "For the story?",
  "36492": "But not as a CELEBRITY?",
  "36493": "Is it possible that you do not know that comparisons of wit with wit, valour with valour, beauty with beauty, birth with birth, are always odious and unwelcome?",
  "36494": "May he share your hopes?",
  "36495": "Do you place it out at interest?",
  "36496": "Then he is on board?",
  "36497": "Do you find the study of the lower orders interesting?",
  "36498": "Can you make any objection?",
  "36499": "It is quite decided, then?",
  "36500": "What shall I pay you for the body?",
  "36501": "Would he not rather say or do the same as his like in the same case?",
  "36502": "Stryver?",
  "36503": "But how do you and your neighbour get on about the disputed right of way?",
  "36504": "Would he have to abdicate his precentorship, as he had his wardenship, and to give up chanting, as he had given up his twelve old bedesmen?",
  "36505": "What is he waiting for?",
  "36506": "Do you remember that's what you used to call them?",
  "36507": "And where is coldness so ugly as between brothers?",
  "36508": "You know you let me call you so?",
  "36509": "Where is he, then?",
  "36510": "Does the cardinal refuse to receive the king?",
  "36511": "Theurgy, magic, and sorcery?",
  "36512": "What can have happened to them all this time?",
  "36513": "What did you talk about?",
  "36514": "Why on earth do you say that?",
  "36515": "Eyebrows?",
  "36516": "Could I forget them?",
  "36517": "Number and date taken, I suppose?",
  "36518": "Have I not borne secrets heavier than this?",
  "36519": "But, then, accidents?",
  "36520": "Do you think it would be any harm?",
  "36521": "Why not add to the first class the pachydermatous indifference to rebuffs which is of such service to the social climber, and, to the second, taste in dress and the habit of not repeating stories?",
  "36522": "Conrad, what is it?",
  "36523": "Bless me, how shall I behave?",
  "36524": "What harm can I do to you or to her?",
  "36525": "On me, uncle?",
  "36526": "Somebody has stolen a rabbit?",
  "36527": "Why enter into painful details, so easily divined by the intelligent reader?",
  "36528": "How do you come here?",
  "36529": "Does any answer come out of it?",
  "36530": "How can he find out his strength or weakness otherwise?",
  "36531": "Have you never made others labor?",
  "36532": "Ist I will be reueng'd?",
  "36533": "Does he give you sharp answers?",
  "36534": "Do we want to contemplate his mercy?",
  "36535": "What is your theory, then, as to those footmarks?",
  "36536": "And how did you find out?",
  "36537": "Are your things sent off?",
  "36538": "Why did they fancy you?",
  "36539": "So, then, am I her enemy?",
  "36540": "Saturday?",
  "36541": "How do you keep it on?",
  "36542": "Well, what if there is a trial?",
  "36543": "What are you yourself seeking?",
  "36544": "Would I be quiet and talk rationally?",
  "36545": "Well, what can you do?",
  "36546": "But what would grammar matter if he really loved her?",
  "36547": "Has he marked himself?",
  "36548": "I ask by whose authority?",
  "36549": "Why need he bother about my tuft?",
  "36550": "Farfrae's?",
  "36551": "Are you turning up your noses?",
  "36552": "What then remained?",
  "36553": "You're getting too proud to own me afore company, are you?",
  "36554": "Your father was fortunate, then?",
  "36555": "Do you really believe that such is our aim?",
  "36556": "Could he, as he asked, stop the sea with his hands?",
  "36557": "What has she done?",
  "36558": "I've fretted my gizzard green about it, maister, but what can I do?",
  "36559": "Quite for ever?",
  "36560": "Is it ketching?",
  "36561": "Your opinion, if you please, on this difficult matter?",
  "36562": "As her husband was a man of means, and had doubtless returned by this time, could she not send them the money?",
  "36563": "And dark?",
  "36564": "What name would your friend like to put on it?",
  "36565": "What are you going to tell me?",
  "36566": "And if you wished to die, you would choose this death, count?",
  "36567": "What are you doing out of your studio at this hour?",
  "36568": "Is love the only thing?",
  "36569": "For that only?",
  "36570": "And I hope you're good children, are you?",
  "36571": "How was it that no one else saw it?",
  "36572": "In our own house?",
  "36573": "Cannot you inform him that it is frightful earnest?",
  "36574": "Well, what shall we do?",
  "36575": "Well, then, are you the brave captain, are you the valiant blade who dispersed those who wished to burn the condemned?",
  "36576": "Will you please look into the case and restore the old man to his home if the public interest will admit?",
  "36577": "Why should we not imagine this the apartment of an honest mother?",
  "36578": "No bid?",
  "36579": "He comes to live with us?",
  "36580": "Have they come from the town?",
  "36581": "But who told you I was inactive?",
  "36582": "Can you remember any breakfast that I've had today?",
  "36583": "And what are they, captain?",
  "36584": "Well, what of it?",
  "36585": "What am I to do?",
  "36586": "Why did you leave there?",
  "36587": "What can you suppose?",
  "36588": "What drawer or tiring do you mean?",
  "36589": "Martha knew about you all the time?",
  "36590": "Why did you paint him?",
  "36591": "Come, who is this man who is in the basket?",
  "36592": "Because I like his company?",
  "36593": "You've got them at last?",
  "36594": "Then why so hurry me?",
  "36595": "Why do you grovel before it?",
  "36596": "Is it all a quite dead garden?",
  "36597": "Now, do you know what all this means?",
  "36598": "Can nothing save him?",
  "36599": "You know his guilt?",
  "36600": "What was that miracle?",
  "36601": "And what may you have to say to him?",
  "36602": "Oh, madam, let me bring you a little something?",
  "36603": "Well, now, what are your conditions, if I employ you?",
  "36604": "You have as good as informed me, sir, that you are going shortly to be married?",
  "36605": "Do you think he wants to die?",
  "36606": "The only question was, had she ten or twelve?",
  "36607": "What faces are the most distinct to me in the fleeting crowd?",
  "36608": "What should you prefer?",
  "36609": "Why not, if it amuses him?",
  "36610": "And pray, where do you consider modern music to begin?",
  "36611": "Why do we hate?",
  "36612": "And if she cast it aside, her loyalty, her promise?",
  "36613": "A prisoner?",
  "36614": "But, even relying on his good faith, would be he able to keep his promise?",
  "36615": "Haow soon?",
  "36616": "But what can I do?",
  "36617": "And the walks in the avenues?",
  "36618": "Who shall reveal the burning anxiety with which he throbbed to see beyond that cruel wall?",
  "36619": "To whom shall I give the list of the children's linen?",
  "36620": "What have you said, but that I am to stay a fortnight longer?",
  "36621": "What do you think of a bite of a mouth like that?",
  "36622": "Shall I rise, madam, and pay my duty to my new aunt?",
  "36623": "Emp'ror?",
  "36624": "What other course could it pursue?",
  "36625": "Where's my ulster?",
  "36626": "What to do next?",
  "36627": "Is she also taken away from me for ever?",
  "36628": "Would not the general loss be too great to justify such relief?",
  "36629": "How many did you get?",
  "36630": "But you like me in spite of it?",
  "36631": "Have you come from a great distance?",
  "36632": "What right have we to argue?",
  "36633": "With the king's command?",
  "36634": "And is she possessed with a devil?",
  "36635": "Upon what is opinion settled?",
  "36636": "Was it an accident?",
  "36637": "What is the good of all this romancing?",
  "36638": "Why on earth not?",
  "36639": "Montmartre?",
  "36640": "What occasions?",
  "36641": "Know not the living that the grave will swallow them up after a life of sadness and cruel misery?",
  "36642": "So, with the springtime, what was more likely than that the wild idea of escaping had come to him?",
  "36643": "He stopped hard by me, and asked if I knew who he was?",
  "36644": "What could be inside it?",
  "36645": "She is your daughter?",
  "36646": "Where could it a come from?",
  "36647": "A murderous attack?",
  "36648": "Has this place any local appellation?",
  "36649": "Shall I strike it, sir?",
  "36650": "Why do you talk to me like this?",
  "36651": "What can he do here?",
  "36652": "You're not racing?",
  "36653": "Shall it lie unproductive in the public vaults?",
  "36654": "What are you looking at now?",
  "36655": "Why went he there?",
  "36656": "Oh, is that all?",
  "36657": "Or is this not true, is there no such thing as pure accident?",
  "36658": "Alas, who shall now comfort the good margrave's wife?",
  "36659": "That book is quite closed?",
  "36660": "What do you expect me to say?",
  "36661": "Why all this coldness, O my best beloved?",
  "36662": "Well, but where have you left the ladies?",
  "36663": "Have you come to meet me?",
  "36664": "And suppose that they were to attack the upper part of the balloon, what would you do?",
  "36665": "Leave?",
  "36666": "Ever, as long as you live?",
  "36667": "Was ever such an account of a dynasty given?",
  "36668": "Is the cloth taken?",
  "36669": "Adam?",
  "36670": "How did you receive that wound on your face?",
  "36671": "But what did you do yesterday after you left me?",
  "36672": "And the harmonious soul is both temperate and courageous?",
  "36673": "Now, how should I, that ne'er have squealed in your sty, know all the swine therein?",
  "36674": "And what do you suppose it's made of?",
  "36675": "Would you have your husband constantly at your feet?",
  "36676": "Where shall you be yourself?",
  "36677": "How many times have I told you to tell me at once?",
  "36678": "Is not that so?",
  "36679": "Is it more afflicting to him to leave the graves of his fathers than it is to our brothers and children?",
  "36680": "And what of passion, or spirit?",
  "36681": "And will you punish him because he cannot become so?",
  "36682": "To you alone, then, may I confide my sorrows and my hopes?",
  "36683": "Shall I be believed?",
  "36684": "Well, and what good would that be?",
  "36685": "It was you, then, that hit me?",
  "36686": "What amount is wanting?",
  "36687": "Do all your people grow on bushes?",
  "36688": "Were all the infinitely numerous kinds of animals and plants created as eggs or seed, or as full grown?",
  "36689": "And what is one?",
  "36690": "What the deuce are you driving at now?",
  "36691": "Who's he?",
  "36692": "Did she?",
  "36693": "Do you think he'll give us a good ride?",
  "36694": "Then how used you it?",
  "36695": "Shall it be the bride or bridegroom?",
  "36696": "Will he be poison'd with a simile?",
  "36697": "Where are we going to now?",
  "36698": "What, CAPITAL?",
  "36699": "But how shall I leave him dreeft?",

  "36736": "These relics have a history then?",
  "36737": "This screaming mob, are they, or are they not, my subjects?",
  "36738": "Would it be much out of the way, to take me in, near the great cathedral door between the two towers?",
  "36739": "But how came you to tell me that he was so disagreeable?",

  "36751": "Are there many?",
  "36752": "Does preparation advance at all?",
  "36753": "What have any of you cussed cattle to do with thinking what's right?",
  "36754": "Was it really, was it really necessary to have so fresh and young a face, a forehead so shy and always ready to cover itself with the pink blush of modesty in order to pass in the lonely night, in a carriage and pair, accompanied by a mysterious lover?",
  "36755": "Have they demolished it stone by stone, and uprooted the soil to the last tree?",
  "36756": "What is it about the sight of sheep that excites one so?",

  "36792": "What time might it be?",
  "36793": "What do I mean by that?",
  "36794": "All your arrangements were made?",
  "36795": "So this was the game, was it?",
  "36796": "Of what blood are you, young gentleman?",
  "36797": "Upon what point?",
  "36798": "It is impossible?",
  "36799": "How, then, is life sustained there and kept up in continuous birth after birth?",
  "36800": "I think I may ask, why do you trouble me?",
  "36801": "What could she say?",
  "36802": "What does your worship want to strip for?",
  "36803": "Have you any chamber on the ground floor where these gentlemen can wait near a good fire?",
  "36804": "Is he not here, then?",
  "36805": "Do you remember you attacked me for seeking enjoyment in life?",
  "36806": "Did I not tell you the lesson I learned over the CHANT HINDOU?",

  "36811": "To the north or south?",
  "36812": "Why did you think I invited you out here?",
  "36813": "Was each man, of whatever color, entitled to the fruits of his own labor, or could one man live in idle luxury by the sweat of another's brow, whose skin was darker?",
  "36814": "Who's sitting there?",

  "36821": "It's you, young ladies, is it?",
  "36822": "How can he know so many dishes, and so fine ones withal?",
  "36823": "Or shall the magistrates differ as the communities differ?",
  "36824": "Who said I were?",
  "36825": "Now, what did the proletaires wish?",
  "36826": "How old is he?",
  "36827": "And beyond that?",
  "36828": "Was it not well worth my while paying you that slight commission in return for a guarantee of your future silence?",
  "36829": "If she could have been but just created, to discover herself as a spouseless mother, with no experience of life except as the parent of a nameless child, would the position have caused her to despair?",
  "36830": "Will I be in time?",
  "36831": "And how did you find out that they belonged to me?",
  "36832": "Not blows, father?",
  "36833": "Certainly, how is it likely I should know where I should stay?",
  "36834": "Whom did you go with?",
  "36835": "Is there not a constant repetition going on of the story of the fable where the storm, blow as it will, cannot tear the cloak from the shoulders of the traveler, while the first warm rays of sunshine make him throw it off immediately?",
  "36836": "Well, what, general?",
  "36837": "Your majesty would condemn me to the lowest, when I have gained the highest?",
  "36838": "The thin, spare man?",
  "36839": "Have you ever met him?",
  "36840": "What's it matter what she says?",
  "36841": "But after that, what did you do, my friend?",
  "36842": "You did not wish to die on the field, you wished to die at home, did you?",
  "36843": "Did he read my letter?",
  "36844": "Do I not know that that is infinite space, and that it is not a round arch?",
  "36845": "And where would they get the money to rescue us if we was to let on we're no worse than other people?",
  "36846": "What will we do, if we get thirsty?",
  "36847": "Tell me, my dear host, if you do not remember this gentleman?",
  "36848": "Should we not feel we had done you wrong, and taken advantage of you?",
  "36849": "Wherefore this desolation of spirit, this anguish of heart?",
  "36850": "And then, no wages, do you hear, my boy?",
  "36851": "But how live in that city?",
  "36852": "Could you?",
  "36853": "How did he get ahead of us?",

  "36856": "Who is it, I say?",
  "36857": "What news have you brought me?",
  "36858": "Then why was he so overwhelmed now, having seen them as he expected?",
  "36859": "Where then are those people whom you are to have for your auxiliaries?",
  "36860": "What would the subjects of the extracts I should have had to make from books, or even the books themselves, have signified to me?",
  "36861": "Can any reasons be given for the prevalence of any one or all of the methods?",
  "36862": "But do you think as they've done her in, sir?",
  "36863": "Why should he strive?",
  "36864": "If the lady is hurt as bad as you say, who was it that wrote this note?",
  "36865": "Does your mother wash?",
  "36866": "What would you have done if you had had to go into the army, to go and fight beneath the standard?",
  "36867": "And whom have you for an advocate?",

  "36873": "Is't night?",
  "36874": "Would you care for a cup of tea?",
  "36875": "Who can say whether we shall ever see them again?",
  "36876": "Well, what am I to do?",
  "36877": "Am I on an island, or is this the sea board of some continent?",
  "36878": "Then turning about towards me, asked what were my commands?",
  "36879": "Why should she think I would reproach her?",
  "36880": "How, then, are we to find her?",
  "36881": "Is it news of my murder?",
  "36882": "As he had a battle to fight, might it not be best to put a bold face upon it?",
  "36883": "And what was the result of those duels?",
  "36884": "Do you mean to say the climate has really any such influence?",
  "36885": "May not the same remark be applied to women?",
  "36886": "Roof ever meet, while they are separated by the four walls, that lie in a contrary position?",
  "36887": "Where are the cards?",
  "36888": "And are not her words too true?",
  "36889": "Is there not time enough for that?",
  "36890": "You'll have some meat?",
  "36891": "Well, what's the matter?",
  "36892": "Why should they ask us?",
  "36893": "Is it not a greater wonder that they should be kept up anywhere?",
  "36894": "Why did the old folly end now, and no later?",

  "36907": "Do you care for me?",
  "36908": "Where to get the money?",
  "36909": "Is it because you are sorry for the professor?",
  "36910": "What is that thing there?",
  "36911": "Have you seen the cardinal?",
  "36912": "And if the end were attained, if at last you emerged from the trial ever beautiful and ever young, defying time and evil, and lifted above the natural decay of flesh and intellect, who shall say that the awesome change would prove a happy one?",

  "37090": "Why cannot I now, as three months ago, draw fresh moral strength from your look, so gentle, calm, and penetrating, a look I loved so well and seem to see before me as I write?",
  "37091": "What use is it for mothers to say anything?",
  "37092": "A bit of shadowing, maybe, or such like?",
  "37093": "Have you ever experienced religion?",
  "37094": "Is it hard to know?",
  "37095": "I am, then, your prisoner?",
  "37096": "What is the use of seeing me after we have made all our arrangements?",
  "37097": "What quality?",
  "37098": "And will nothing be done to them?",
  "37099": "Ever been in prison?",
  "37100": "Why should I do it?",
  "37101": "Mine, sir?",
  "37102": "What is there against him?",
  "37103": "Now where shall we put this most excellent man?",
  "37104": "How much did you say he took?",
  "37105": "Win anything?",
  "37106": "Have you got what you looked for?",
  "37107": "Where are their females?",
  "37108": "Will not it come of its own accord when I am a woman grown?",
  "37109": "What sweets are we going to have?",
  "37110": "Say you have not?",
  "37111": "Or, on the other hand, might it not be attracted to the great central source of light and heat, and be absorbed in it?",
  "37112": "But where shall we find him?",
  "37113": "S'pose they'd have me thar?",
  "37114": "What was that you said about seeing someone up there on top of the hill?",
  "37115": "Had he resisted, and been overcome in the struggle?",
  "37116": "Why was he able to stand in the place of the scarecrow, hidden by nothing but an old hat?",
  "37117": "Who would not have expected them to be insipid likenesses of each other?",
  "37118": "What has he said to you?",
  "37119": "That is no business of yours either, is it?",
  "37120": "That I was so happy as I was?",
  "37121": "Which of us is happy in this world?",
  "37122": "Where do you think to go to?",
  "37123": "Why did he come in?",
  "37124": "Why will you ask him in terms that he does not comprehend?",
  "37125": "And shall I ever neglect her, or hurt her, or even forget to consider her?",
  "37126": "Well, how is he?",
  "37127": "Am I, then, so very revolting?",
  "37128": "Ought I to vanish?",
  "37129": "Where are you taking us to?",
  "37130": "Whither was he to flee from universal famine?",
  "37131": "And have you handed in the petition?",
  "37132": "I mean, are you going to stay on in your cottage?",
  "37133": "May I have the use of your skiff?",
  "37134": "What sin of mine could merit such a rod?",
  "37135": "Do you even know whether higher prices for articles of luxury would not be an obstacle to the cheapness of necessary objects, and whether, in trying to favor the most numerous class, you would not render the general condition worse?",
  "37136": "Indeed?",
  "37137": "When shall we be there?",
  "37138": "And if they were able to converse with one another, would they not suppose that they were naming what was actually before them?",
  "37139": "Why does my blood rush into a hell of tumult at a few words?",
  "37140": "But in what does a strong association between a word and an idea differ from a weak one?",
  "37141": "And wha will glove my hand?",
  "37142": "And how is this accomplished well except by general principles, some about the nature of the universe, and others about the proper constitution of man?",
  "37143": "Do you wonder that I avow this to you?",
  "37144": "You like that better than all your playthings, eh?",
  "37145": "Yet why be afraid?",
  "37146": "Do you find any dazzling sensation before the eyes?",
  "37147": "It's the right one, I suppose?",
  "37148": "And why wonder at that?",
  "37149": "Why, what is a silhouette party?",
  "37150": "How do you mean, I too?",
  "37151": "What sort of a fatality, in short, is that which is contradicted every instant by the facts which take place within its bosom?",
  "37152": "And do you really love him quite well enough?",
  "37153": "But how did these women bear themselves amid toils so arduous?",
  "37154": "Volumnia, do I make myself intelligible?",
  "37155": "Is all the spilt wine swallowed?",
  "37156": "And where is that letter?",
  "37157": "What would become of his wife if he should be convicted?",
  "37158": "He who had ever been so good to her, why had he now failed her so grievously?",
  "37159": "You are great friends, eh, all together?",
  "37160": "Do you find any trouble or disquiet in your body by the importunate stings and pricklings of the flesh?",
  "37161": "Well, then, where do we dine?",
  "37162": "Find we no cure for wounds?",
  "37163": "Where did you go?",
  "37164": "Ah, how would she feel then?",
  "37165": "Did he wear a vest?",
  "37166": "Now, do you honestly think they can?",
  "37167": "What is its breadth?",
  "37168": "It's a bad business, eh?",
  "37169": "Do you waltz?",
  "37170": "How could I?",
  "37171": "Are you content with yourself and with your life?",
  "37172": "And what does the author mean to do?",
  "37173": "Was it intentionally?",
  "37174": "May I ask your reason for such an insulting supposition, sir?",
  "37175": "What was the force of that army?",
  "37176": "But of what?",
  "37177": "Do you know where we are going?",
  "37178": "What's the use of it?",
  "37179": "What year?",
  "37180": "But, woe is me, wherefore do I complain?",
  "37181": "Have you a garden of your own?",
  "37182": "Why is not this principle universal?",
  "37183": "And was the sum a large one?",
  "37184": "Why, we are all mortal, are we not?",
  "37185": "Philip, how can you be so unkind?",
  "37186": "Where is he now?",
  "37187": "Will your majesty please proceed?",
  "37188": "And, besides, what is paying it but submission to tyranny?",
  "37189": "But why all this secrecy?",
  "37190": "Oh, gosh?",
  "37191": "Not much in the habit of such travelling yourself, I think, sir?",
  "37192": "But what's the matter with you?",
  "37193": "Besides, what could you have to tell me?",
  "37194": "You know that you are recalled to life?",
  "37195": "Will she be back soon?",
  "37196": "Airing yourself, as I am doing, before you go to bed?",
  "37197": "And the sometime greater to the sometime less, and the greater that is to be to the less that is to be?",
  "37198": "Is the hand not always pointing there?",
  "37199": "But who was the spy who stole the papers?",
  "37200": "And yet the cardinal was attached to you?",
  "37201": "But, such being the case, where could you have heard the same report?",
  "37202": "Why had he not told her everything?",
  "37203": "Who is that BRAHMA?",
  "37204": "What offence did I commit?",
  "37205": "Where am I to find them?",
  "37206": "What paper have you written for?",
  "37207": "How should the leman of a vassal become a king's wife?",
  "37208": "Where are you from?",
  "37209": "Is it he?",
  "37210": "And these other instruments, the use of which I cannot guess?",
  "37211": "She will pay, only when?",
  "37212": "Do you mean write it to her?",
  "37213": "How do you make that out?",
  "37214": "Russian books, indeed ?",
  "37215": "To whom then?",
  "37216": "You prefer to stay here and imagine that all the world is gaping at your pictures?",
  "37217": "What know I of the minister's heart?",
  "37218": "And why among us four?",
  "37219": "You were looking for me out of the window?",
  "37220": "Has he not already forgotten she ever existed?",
  "37221": "Is he not solid gold?",
  "37222": "What are their secret counsels?",
  "37223": "Who'll say a guinea?",
  "37224": "Do you think I particularly like you?",
  "37225": "Who is he, my dear?",
  "37226": "And did you?",
  "37227": "Shall I ever know any thing?",
  "37228": "Where is that murderer?",
  "37229": "Oh, is it broken?",
  "37230": "For not alluding to your leaving us?",
  "37231": "What then must be the result?",
  "37232": "What is all settled?",
  "37233": "Saw you those meteors?",
  "37234": "And what will that good treatment be?",
  "37235": "Well, but is there any war on record which was carried on successfully by him, or aided by his counsels, when he was alive?",
  "37236": "Do you want a map?",
  "37237": "But what other is there?",
  "37238": "You understand the rest, then?",
  "37239": "Where were we?",
  "37240": "Why was it?",
  "37241": "What made you choose that particular direction?",
  "37242": "Then the cost of this vessel is great?",
  "37243": "Socrates, has taken possession of you all?",
  "37244": "Have you seen for YOUR self?",
  "37245": "Bore me, my dear?",
  "37246": "How can I ever pay you?",
  "37247": "Give me one little sip more, and tell me from whom you received the noble gift?",
  "37248": "But the orders?",
  "37249": "How here?",
  "37250": "Did he not, my dear father and mother, deserve all the truth to be told?",
  "37251": "You think that likely?",
  "37252": "Can we not better make the attempt after dark?",
  "37253": "Carver, you DO think him witty?",
  "37254": "Giry?",
  "37255": "Why are they leaving the town?",
  "37256": "What is the meaning of that noise?",
  "37257": "And did you go alone?",
  "37258": "What good wind brings you here?",
  "37259": "And if he were dead, to what height of fury would not the violence of the people lash the legionaries?",
  "37260": "You see I am generous, am I not, mother?",
  "37261": "What charm has gone from the twilight?",
  "37262": "What is it, sir?",
  "37263": "And what brought you here?",
  "37264": "Could he have any, do you suppose?",
  "37265": "FOOD FOR THE VULTURES?",
  "37266": "Is it as nice as it sounds?",
  "37267": "You're no wiser than the rest of us, are you?",
  "37268": "Still dreaming and staring?",
  "37269": "How dare you say such things about me?",
  "37270": "Is it not true that legists are governed by caprice in giving and taking away rights?",
  "37271": "Will you go over and get some canned peaches?",
  "37272": "Do not you think that if I were about any king, proposing good laws to him, and endeavouring to root out all the cursed seeds of evil that I found in him, I should either be turned out of his court, or, at least, be laughed at for my pains?",
  "37273": "And you heard nothing, and saw nothing?",
  "37274": "When did he go to church last?",
  "37275": "Which then shall we prefer?",
  "37276": "What more inconstant than the desires of man?",
  "37277": "And you obeyed?",
  "37278": "Which should he take?",
  "37279": "What's the matter?",
  "37280": "Does it not make you shudder?",
  "37281": "What infernal noise?",
  "37282": "Jellyby's?",
  "37283": "Do any of you know of one?",
  "37284": "They did not, and why not?",
  "37285": "When do you leave town?",
  "37286": "He knows what YOU know?",
  "37287": "What are you bothering him for?",
  "37288": "How, sir?",
  "37289": "Whom shall we call, lest spectres should appear?",
  "37290": "Differently?",
  "37291": "And how am I to cross?",
  "37292": "But what am I going to eat?",
  "37293": "How often am I to call you?",
  "37294": "Is it not a source of mortification to a class of men that they are excluded from political power?",
  "37295": "A murder do you call it?",
  "37296": "Who does not love you?",
  "37297": "How like you her wit?",
  "37298": "Have you got anything of your own?",
  "37299": "But where are the folk?",
  "37300": "But shall I not use tobacco at all?",
  "37301": "Will you never be done getting me into trouble?",
  "37302": "Françoise, all these young fellows not caring two straws for their lives?",
  "37303": "Why, tell me, said he, what answer you would make?",
  "37304": "What can be done with four?",
  "37305": "Was he not contented with his children?",
  "37306": "Can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws?",
  "37307": "And, as he so resolved, he could not but ask himself the question, whether the charge of the parish ought to be left in the hands of such a man?",
  "37308": "You told him that?",
  "37309": "Would you advise me, whilst able to fight, to throw the arms I hold in my hand to the ground?",
  "37310": "Now, what do you want with me?",
  "37311": "What are people planning against him?",
  "37312": "Forever a footman?",
  "37313": "But where are we, uncle?",
  "37314": "Who forced my hand, as was the lawful cap'n?",
  "37315": "Will your majesty do me the honor to explain yourself?",
  "37316": "Who could this young woman be, I wonder?",
  "37317": "The beginning of what?",
  "37318": "Why does the theatre draw me so that I am willing to sacrifice for it even those I love?",
  "37319": "Can you remember?",
  "37320": "But why should these rough drafts of letters be regarded as anything else than what they actually and obviously are?",
  "37321": "Why had he married the eyes in the photograph?",
  "37322": "Ned, my dear fellow, will you mention what we agreed upon?",
  "37323": "Do you know what that is?",
  "37324": "Was he satisfied?",
  "37325": "He whom your aunt intends for you?",
  "37326": "I was to leave town the next day for a fortnight's absence, and whom had they to see to them?",
  "37327": "What do I ask now?",
  "37328": "What shall we do for dessert?",
  "37329": "Who do you give your casting vote to?",
  "37330": "How is it that this difference happens?",
  "37331": "What became of the two men?",
  "37332": "And has not the body itself less of truth and essence than the soul?",
  "37333": "Better?",
  "37334": "She did, hey?",
  "37335": "Why did his condition improve?",
  "37336": "Will they permit me to enter?",
  "37337": "Was she lying?",
  "37338": "Jane, are you ready?",
  "37339": "Then you suppose it was the people alone who wished to burn the condemned?",
  "37340": "Is it a strict moral obligation?",
  "37341": "Who came hither?",
  "37342": "How will you judge the counterfeit, if you have no guarantee?",
  "37343": "Damn it now, what's his name?",
  "37344": "Is there ony room at your feet?",
  "37345": "May I count on you?",
  "37346": "And where am I to sit?",
  "37347": "Where has she taken refuge?",
  "37348": "Why should I go to see them, therefore?",
  "37349": "And if he found them differing as much from one another as from his first counsellors, would he not act prudently in trying the experiment unanimously recommended by the latter, rather than be hearkening to those who could neither deny the necessity of a speedy remedy, nor agree in proposing one?",
  "37350": "Are there not the unjust who are fortunate, while the just are unfortunate?",
  "37351": "What would he think of me, of my lack of will?",
  "37352": "Is the imp altogether evil?",
  "37353": "In this new revolution thus established forever, who shall decide which is the sun and which is the moon?",
  "37354": "Of THEMSELVES?",
  "37355": "What are you saying to me?",
  "37356": "What is yonder?",
  "37357": "When did you lie, the last time or now?",
  "37358": "Did he live his life again in every detail of desire, temptation, and surrender during that supreme moment of complete knowledge?",
  "37359": "Did you see him?",
  "37360": "What prompted me then to disturb the memory of the buried dead?",
  "37361": "How shall we destroy him?",
  "37362": "Am I not your mother also?",
  "37363": "And the bridegroom?",
  "37364": "What are young men to rocks and mountains?",
  "37365": "I am her father, am I not?",
  "37366": "Going to be in town long?",
  "37367": "But when will that be?",
  "37368": "But what have I done to you?",
  "37369": "Yours is a long life to look back upon, sir?",
  "37370": "Why have you come?",
  "37371": "And that we may dismiss you to the moor and the rainy night?",
  "37372": "Will it come off?",
  "37373": "Why is there so much negation and abnegation in your hearts?",
  "37374": "And is there any greater or keener pleasure than that of sensual love?",
  "37375": "You know the consequences of mixing them?",
  "37376": "Did you think a gentleman would be likely to take any interest in you?",
  "37377": "But what reference has that to me?",
  "37378": "You were her first love?",
  "37379": "Who were they?",
  "37380": "Do you want him to be fond of you?",
  "37381": "Where would you go?",
  "37382": "What advantages had she?",
  "37383": "Well, how has all gone off?",
  "37384": "Do we pay no money?",
  "37385": "What weapon would he choose?",
  "37386": "Why did he not go on?",
  "37387": "What will you take for it?",
  "37388": "Anything for me?",
  "37389": "What is there more?",
  "37390": "Is your majesty satisfied to see the earl and the queen make their appearance at this meeting?",
  "37391": "What possessed you to tell those stories about my saddle, and the hats and boots, and all the rest of it?",
  "37392": "Perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him?",
  "37393": "Was I, then, not yet aware that what I felt, myself, for her, depended neither upon her actions nor upon my desires?",
  "37394": "Even as a man who rides a horse is called a horseman?",
  "37395": "Not to me, I hope?",
  "37396": "Has he any objection to make to them which would justify him in overturning them?",
  "37397": "A young gentleman, is he not?",
  "37398": "But have you reflected seriously?",
  "37399": "Is this your indifference, your uninteresting conversation?",
  "37400": "Then one may smoke on board?",
  "37401": "Why should not she be a maid of honor, as well as myself?",
  "37402": "What will come out of those three elements when I am no longer present to combine them?",
  "37403": "Stopping here?",
  "37404": "Sed?",
  "37405": "As princes of the blood, in fact?",
  "37406": "What, faithless?",
  "37407": "What else do you want?",
  "37408": "Why has she been crying?",
  "37409": "What can they have done with him?",
  "37410": "Do you love me, then?",
  "37411": "Will they neither obey nor make room for those who will?",
  "37412": "At what point shall we expect the approach of danger?",
  "37413": "But shall not we, ourselves, the truth maintain?",
  "37414": "But, after all, what is this metaphor called a crown, or rather what is monarchy?",
  "37415": "Is the aggregate power of the general government greater than ought to have been vested in it?",
  "37416": "And that other gentleman?",
  "37417": "What would your excellency like to eat?",
  "37418": "How much do a king git?",
  "37419": "How many times?",
  "37420": "Why should she not be his?",
  "37421": "How do you maintain discipline among your men?",
  "37422": "What make do you like?",
  "37423": "What is the bridge for?",
  "37424": "You think I was concerned in the plot which brought about the rupture, do you not?",
  "37425": "Who was by him at night?",
  "37426": "Fit, I hope?",
  "37427": "Less than two minutes?",
  "37428": "Nor lay before your eyes what afflictions you yourselves have undergone?",
  "37429": "Mind?",
  "37430": "Suppose, then, a man speak an idle word, and die suddenly, before he has time to repent and confess his sin, will he be lost everlastingly?",
  "37431": "You were also married before you had this wife?",
  "37432": "Was the cause of death mentioned?",
  "37433": "The little princess?",
  "37434": "And that door is locked?",
  "37435": "Yes, or no?",
  "37436": "Found what?",
  "37437": "Why do you give the poor fellow no hope?",
  "37438": "Ah, what have you done to me?",
  "37439": "But what in the name of goodness could provoke you to tempt your fate so long?",
  "37440": "What can more exactly answer the rule laid down, to recommend even those representations of things which have so many other just objections leaving against them?",
  "37441": "Has such and such a perfume done anything for me?",
  "37442": "You want big things that you can make your teeth meet in?",
  "37443": "Why did you tell me those things?",
  "37444": "I am not exempt, and ask now, shall I tend the herds?",
  "37445": "Where have you hurt yourself?",
  "37446": "Did such a being exist?",
  "37447": "Wherein do the principles of scientific management differ essentially from those of ordinary management?",
  "37448": "How's his heart?",
  "37449": "But what's in this chest?",
  "37450": "Quite a big girl, I expect?",
  "37451": "You think not?",
  "37452": "Did I shoot straight, nurse?",
  "37453": "Agnes, shall I tell you what about?",
  "37454": "Explained nothing?",
  "37455": "And my position with regard to money?",
  "37456": "What's got into the beast?",
  "37457": "What colour?",
  "37458": "What's the meaning of this, madame?",
  "37459": "Have you a heart?",
  "37460": "You find it so?",
  "37461": "Why, in a word, by thus speaking, do you prevent me from being frank in my turn?",
  "37462": "Can you prove that they aim at my crown?",
  "37463": "Whither are you leading us?",
  "37464": "Are you hungry?",
  "37465": "Give the little lad some more?",
  "37466": "Who caused you to suppose so?",
  "37467": "And in what did all this training end?",
  "37468": "Can it be me?",
  "37469": "But may I ask you one question?",
  "37470": "Went off to die?",
  "37471": "So he has not left his new address?",
  "37472": "I shall?",
  "37473": "My schemes, my labours, and my hopes be vain?",
  "37474": "And what do you mean to do?",
  "37475": "Sally with you too?",
  "37476": "Reader, were you ever present at the examination of a criminal?",
  "37477": "Is there not sad stuff?",
  "37478": "Could you take me away?",
  "37479": "What's brewing?",
  "37480": "Where and why are you going, when you might remain here?",
  "37481": "Shall you be glad to see him?",
  "37482": "Is it as your leader says?",
  "37483": "Schon fleissig?",
  "37484": "How did she bear it?",
  "37485": "Do you truly love me?",
  "37486": "What answer was possible to such stupid complimenting?",
  "37487": "Did you feel as if you hated people?",
  "37488": "But what shall we drink to, so as to avoid wounding any susceptibility?",
  "37489": "What does it matter who fires across you?",
  "37490": "Were you at the opera yesterday?",
  "37491": "Do you not find it so, queen?",
  "37492": "What kind of soothsaying do you want?",
  "37493": "Oh, is it raining?",
  "37494": "Did you speak, sir?",
  "37495": "Supposing she is not able to give one?",
  "37496": "Then, why on earth does he come here?",
  "37497": "But, then, would these two men tacitly have come to one of these infamous little agreements so common in society?",
  "37498": "Is it like cudgel playing or other sportful forms of bloodshed?",
  "37499": "And mine a part of yours?",
  "37500": "Why rake into those corners of nature which spread a nuisance all around?",
  "37501": "And she prefers the duke?",
  "37502": "Shall I call him down?",
  "37503": "What can we do?",
  "37504": "Your excellency is safe and sound?",
  "37505": "Are there no love stories?",
  "37506": "How can I put it into words?",
  "37507": "Where is that common stock and why will certain germs acquire certain tendencies and other germs retain other peculiarities?",
  "37508": "Has he assassinated any one?",
  "37509": "Another projectile?",
  "37510": "His daughter?",
  "37511": "How could it be anything but damp in such a situation?",
  "37512": "What at?",
  "37513": "What's wrong naow?",
  "37514": "Catharine does not love the king?",
  "37515": "And two?",
  "37516": "And both pleasure and pain are motions of the soul, are they not?",
  "37517": "And who are the people you amuse?",
  "37518": "Why do you object?",
  "37519": "Are you afraid that I will not pay you?",
  "37520": "What means her lay?",
  "37521": "Of what use is professional education, of what good are agricultural and commercial schools, if your students have neither employment nor capital?",
  "37522": "What have you to say in your defence?",
  "37523": "You mean that learned sixteenth century savant, a naturalist, a chemist, and a traveller?",
  "37524": "A man or a woman?",
  "37525": "Do you believe that cock and bull story about his having been stowed away on board ship?",
  "37526": "What do I think of whom?",
  "37527": "What was a bachelor like you asked here for?",
  "37528": "Is it not true that you only bought this house five or six days ago?",
  "37529": "In that case, why did the later interpolating poets introduce iron as the special material of tools and implements, knives and axes, in an age when they knew that there was no iron?",
  "37530": "Did he not become a benefactor to the whole district?",
  "37531": "What good does it do to magnify an expression, and play with equivocations, as if we expected to change the reality thereby?",
  "37532": "And how long had you to take care of him?",
  "37533": "What do you deduce from it?",
  "37534": "But who, my dear, could have expected to meet you here, in this frightful place, so far from home?",
  "37535": "Do you suffer much?",
  "37536": "Who was this goodman?",
  "37537": "Is it right, boy?",
  "37538": "In what land?",
  "37539": "In to the political prisoners?",
  "37540": "D'you mean to say you have to work all that time and spend a small fortune just to earn three pounds a week at the end of it?",
  "37541": "Oh, indeed, sir?",
  "37542": "You remember what farcybuds are like?",
  "37543": "Yes, and how quick do you think they would let me go, if I did?",
  "37544": "You imagine, poor child, that the wretches are in love?",
  "37545": "Who cares?",
  "37546": "But, what can any individual do?",
  "37547": "Where were these lovely creatures housed?",
  "37548": "You know what artists do?",
  "37549": "Why do you doubt it?",
  "37550": "How make a road, a canal, or clear a greatly obstructed river?",
  "37551": "You have heard from me lately?",
  "37552": "And what had become of them?",
  "37553": "For love?",
  "37554": "And of monsieur le surintendant?",
  "37555": "Had he that sorrow too?",
  "37556": "For two hours, then?",
  "37557": "By delicate attentions?",
  "37558": "What is their value?",
  "37559": "Are you gloomy or cheerful?",
  "37560": "Can you doubt it?",
  "37561": "And your message?",
  "37562": "Does he know that?",
  "37563": "And why not marry her if she really has so much money?",
  "37564": "How will we give the things?",
  "37565": "But how came you to stay out so late, my dear?",
  "37566": "Well, who but I?",
  "37567": "What has put that into your head?",
  "37568": "Do you comprehend the full meaning of these words?",
  "37569": "Have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?",
  "37570": "It is there, then?",
  "37571": "Should we be hurled to the ground?",
  "37572": "What benefit have they been to the colony?",
  "37573": "But your child has come back?",
  "37574": "Adele may accompany us, may she not, sir?",
  "37575": "Are you living with your mother?",
  "37576": "And what have I done, dear grandpapa, that you should be angry with me?",
  "37577": "Even if witnesses were present when I borrowed the money?",
  "37578": "How the devil does he come to be one of the wedding party?",
  "37579": "And of what nature am I now making it?",
  "37580": "Rostov, where are you?",
  "37581": "What's the matter with your foot?",
  "37582": "What in the name of all that's fantastic can you dream that I have to complain OF?",
  "37583": "For what?",
  "37584": "You will?",
  "37585": "Who are you callin mate?",
  "37586": "Which way did she go?",
  "37587": "Has any one been speaking to you against me?",
  "37588": "How many sick persons?",
  "37589": "Then who will be caught?",
  "37590": "Is it true?",
  "37591": "Are you angry with me?",
  "37592": "Why are you blushing?",
  "37593": "And now why do you not me?",
  "37594": "Then wherefore should you ask me such a question?",
  "37595": "What course shall we then take?",
  "37596": "Help it?",
  "37597": "Being my limbs, what does it signify?",
  "37598": "But what then has happened, from one day to the other, to HER?",
  "37599": "Tantae animis coelestibus irae?",
  "37600": "Did he not think her good looking, then?",
  "37601": "If, on the contrary, we ought to exceed this point, where can we stop, short of an indefinite power of providing for emergencies as they may arise?",
  "37602": "Are you not pleased with it?",
  "37603": "Have we anything else to stay for?",
  "37604": "And where be our family mansions and estates?",
  "37605": "But am I talking too much?",
  "37606": "Any orders, sir?",
  "37607": "Why do you say all this to me?",
  "37608": "Idleness?",
  "37609": "Oh, you run away from home, did you?",
  "37610": "What does the end look like?",
  "37611": "But where was this water from?",
  "37612": "Did she say that to me?",
  "37613": "These are, doubtless, your family arms?",
  "37614": "Was it to them an unknown island, ready to become a magazine for stolen cargoes?",
  "37615": "Then why not change it?",
  "37616": "Yours?",
  "37617": "Who can tell of the mending and patching, of the very wearing midnight hours of needlework which were accomplished before the poor girl went, so that she might not reach her friend's house in actual rags?",
  "37618": "Now who is it in this ship to whom the letters will be shown?",
  "37619": "What should not you mind?",
  "37620": "When will the gaoler bring us our pottage?",
  "37621": "But where are you going?",
  "37622": "James sweet on her, hey?",
  "37623": "Did anyone know that these proofs would be there?",
  "37624": "Oh, they was, eh?",
  "37625": "Is it mad yous are?",
  "37626": "WHAT do you think she'd do if she caught us?",
  "37627": "Who can doubt this?",
  "37628": "Is he her father?",
  "37629": "How do, my dear?",
  "37630": "But, alas?",
  "37631": "What CAN I do?",
  "37632": "How could they win him over to rejoin them?",
  "37633": "You lodge me in your house, close to yourself like this?",
  "37634": "Do you want me to help you or not?",
  "37635": "Or that they, who see different and dissimilar parts, should judge differently from each other?",
  "37636": "But why should one take trouble to insist upon the advance of science and art in the medieval city?",
  "37637": "How should I not be?",
  "37638": "Hannah, is that milk?",
  "37639": "Who could have believed it?",
  "37640": "And you will call on that atheist?",
  "37641": "What need to make a long discourse of what followed?",
  "37642": "And it is?",
  "37643": "Will she not depart as suddenly as she came?",
  "37644": "Can I have also been like that?",
  "37645": "Can you count in your head?",
  "37646": "To whom shall I yield me?",
  "37647": "Why, when, knaves?",
  "37648": "He was undone, for how could he ask the general for his place again?",
  "37649": "How did you know that I was a prisoner in that tent?",
  "37650": "Where is mother?",
  "37651": "Who is?",
  "37652": "Who ran to catch me when I fell, and kissed the place to make it well?",
  "37653": "Do you hear sir?",
  "37654": "Do you know that passage?",
  "37655": "Does he wish to be a bishop?",
  "37656": "What brings you here?",
  "37657": "I came, then, to inquire how monsieur had passed the night, and if monsieur intended to keep this apartment?",
  "37658": "Just now?",
  "37659": "And would not the chamberlains have a right to be vexed by it?",
  "37660": "Your majesty has the plan?",
  "37661": "Who would believe this childish discipline, received at eight years old, from the hands of a woman of thirty, should influence my propensities, my desires, my passions, for the rest of my life, and that in quite a contrary sense from what might naturally have been expected?",
  "37662": "Tomorrow?",
  "37663": "Seen her?",
  "37664": "What was that I was saying about denouncing myself?",
  "37665": "Have you got your divorce then?",
  "37666": "Why, what's the matter, trow?",
  "37667": "Monsieur would wish to see my camp, and witness for himself our numbers, and the impossibility of his resisting them with success?",
  "37668": "My friends, do you know what those creatures use for wads?",
  "37669": "Was it worth while, I asked myself, to invent such rubbish at such a moment?",
  "37670": "Is that long ago?",
  "37671": "Ernest was annoyed and surprised, for had not his father and mother been wanting him to be more religious all his life?",
  "37672": "Oh, was it right my asking him to dinner?",
  "37673": "Will you cause that to be done for me?",
  "37674": "Was his whole life to be shown up as a useless sham a second time?",
  "37675": "Does that please you?",
  "37676": "Kingsford?",
  "37677": "What prevented it?",
  "37678": "Of what nature are they?",
  "37679": "Were they then so many?",
  "37680": "The solemn song be sung ?",
  "37681": "How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains?",
  "37682": "Where's the little scamp got to?",
  "37683": "Pardon for whom?",
  "37684": "What does it ALL mean?",
  "37685": "What are those men in those carts?",
  "37686": "Horrid little bird, why did it eat all my starch?",
  "37687": "Surely I was serious enough?",
  "37688": "But above all things, I am a marvel to you?",
  "37689": "Were you ever up there?",
  "37690": "Was it then that you found her again?",
  "37691": "Of what sort had been the life of the man who had stood for years at the top of a pillar?",
  "37692": "What do you think is the cause of so strange a sound?",
  "37693": "And, as it is our last evening together under quite the same circumstances as during all these weeks, will you agree to a plan of mine?",
  "37694": "Do you know that you have composed some of the most beautiful music in the world?",
  "37695": "Were the distinction or separation of possessions entirely useless, can any one conceive, that it ever should have obtained in society?",
  "37696": "Yet, after all, what is there in it that should surprise us?",
  "37697": "What would you not tell her?",
  "37698": "Not by his daughter?",
  "37699": "Who wants them?",
  "37700": "Ah, why?",
  "37701": "And when this principle measures and certifies that some things are equal, or that some are greater or less than others, there occurs an apparent contradiction?",
  "37702": "There was a row, was there?",
  "37703": "It's you, is it, who played this trick on me?",
  "37704": "To my sister?",
  "37705": "You have, eh?",
  "37706": "What interest have they in your death?",
  "37707": "Do you know how to sew?",
  "37708": "How, then, could power take up the defence of that which the law did not foresee or define, of that which is the opposite of the rights recognized by the legislator?",
  "37709": "What do you mean by locking the door when decent people come to call upon us?",
  "37710": "Was a miner a good miner?",
  "37711": "Biscarrat is a prisoner?",
  "37712": "She is very amiable, then, is she not?",
  "37713": "Do we not wish for an outlet for our surplus population, if I may so express myself?",
  "37714": "Why should she spare others?",
  "37715": "What may that mean now?",
  "37716": "If she looked favorably upon another, do you mean, monsieur?",
  "37717": "Was he to make her over, to make any portion of her over to others, if, by doing so, she might be able to share the wealth, as well as the coarse manners and uncouth society of her at present unknown connexions?",
  "37718": "How is this strange silence to be accounted for?",
  "37719": "But, putting that aside altogether, what would they live on?",
  "37720": "But how and where?",
  "37721": "Come, will you take me as I am?",
  "37722": "And wherefore?",
  "37723": "What is the matter with me?",
  "37724": "But, pray, when you have been pumped dry one day, what have you got the next?",
  "37725": "You'd like to see the room, young man?",
  "37726": "Who knows where the winds will carry this case, and in whose hands it will fall?",
  "37727": "Have we not authorized you to give yourself entirely up to this love?",
  "37728": "The vault under the altar?",
  "37729": "Did he voluntarily ignite his own funeral pyre?",
  "37730": "Well, when can you?",
  "37731": "Is it his own, do you think?",
  "37732": "Is it dread of the unknown?",
  "37733": "She has a carriage, then, this niece of the doctor?",
  "37734": "What would you do then?",
  "37735": "And are they going farther westward?",
  "37736": "But what says the scout?",
  "37737": "Was it warm out there, sonny?",
  "37738": "Not do it?",
  "37739": "But supposing you did?",
  "37740": "Where did it lead to?",
  "37741": "Where are the street cars and the motors?",
  "37742": "Quarrelled?",
  "37743": "Would you care to take it?",
  "37744": "For one thing, what do we know of you?",
  "37745": "Have you ever had any experience upon the stage?",
  "37746": "On the jury, are you?",
  "37747": "Your excellency knows him?",
  "37748": "We know that the first has been here, but where are the signs of the other?",
  "37749": "How many chloral tabloids did you take?",
  "37750": "And what injury would they do to others?",
  "37751": "Why does it stop there?",
  "37752": "Are you getting about again yet, old fellow?",
  "37753": "Have you any means of transport?",
  "37754": "Why should you put things so bitterly, dearie?",
  "37755": "The millionaire's mite, eh?",
  "37756": "Are they real?",
  "37757": "And for what purpose?",
  "37758": "Do you suppose the boat will sail promptly?",
  "37759": "What was its standard?",
  "37760": "Do you remember how silent I was on the drive back?",
  "37761": "I ask, therefore, if a man, in this situation, and guilty of these two errors, is to be regarded as vicious and criminal, however unavoidable they might have been?",
  "37762": "Besides, why were they not allowed to escape?",
  "37763": "Were we really there half an hour?",
  "37764": "Does that satisfy you?",
  "37765": "Do you see that, my dear?",
  "37766": "The circumstances?",
  "37767": "Would you imagine it?",
  "37768": "O, is't the custom?",
  "37769": "How many had I?",
  "37770": "What does he want me to do, I wonder?",
  "37771": "What, outside our line?",
  "37772": "That he should appear only at that point?",
  "37773": "What are you saying?",
  "37774": "Foolish indeed?",
  "37775": "Quite strong and well, I hope?",
  "37776": "Is his power of speech gone?",
  "37777": "Would he not have done better to have kept the water that he had decomposed in pure loss, in order to sustain him in the air?",
  "37778": "And he might have asked also, where the industry so necessary for such a trade?",
  "37779": "Was he so awfully hot?",
  "37780": "Where she would be settled?",
  "37781": "Has madame come in yet?",
  "37782": "And which I can have?",
  "37783": "For who would understand the work within him?",
  "37784": "The spider?",
  "37785": "Where can we be going in such a tiny pool of water?",
  "37786": "Had you heard that?",
  "37787": "But what then, made her so unhappy?",
  "37788": "No brother at all?",
  "37789": "The question I have to ask myself is, shall I marry him?",
  "37790": "Perhaps two o'clock will suit you better?",
  "37791": "Anyone in the room could get out?",
  "37792": "A dream?",
  "37793": "And his eminence, the cardinal?",
  "37794": "Did you answer it yourself?",
  "37795": "And what does she come worming herself in here for?",
  "37796": "What comes next?",
  "37797": "This prisoner, who was he?",
  "37798": "Do you recollect me?",
  "37799": "The lieutenant of musketeers?",
  "37800": "You wish to be, according to your tastes or private friendships, free to destroy my plans and save my enemies?",
  "37801": "If I be right in this, how could we make any entirely new improvement by means of tonnage duties?",
  "37802": "Wherein differ the sea and the land, that a miracle upon one is not a miracle upon the other?",
  "37803": "Will you leave that spinning wheel be, you young devils?",
  "37804": "You're wretched, he's wretched, and what good can come of it?",
  "37805": "You have received a regular letter of advice?",
  "37806": "What was that awful noise?",
  "37807": "I asked him where he meant to go?",
  "37808": "And light of foot?",
  "37809": "Do you feel unwell?",
  "37810": "What is a fontis?",
  "37811": "And will not their wives be the best women?",
  "37812": "How, then, did you deduce the telegram?",
  "37813": "I have heard a party was to leave the encampment this morning for the lake shore?",
  "37814": "What do you call important?",
  "37815": "And, really, what is the result of all this?",
  "37816": "What do you do in your cottage when it rains like this?",
  "37817": "If so, what we are afraid of, when we but suspect our enemies will inflict it on us, shall we inflict it on ourselves for certain?",
  "37818": "But where are you going really?",
  "37819": "Did not the sun shine upon him with a halo, so that he was bright as an angel?",
  "37820": "No dinner?",
  "37821": "How much does the proprietor increase the utility of his tenant's products?",
  "37822": "You've never worked at anything like this before, have you?",
  "37823": "Did you see us?",
  "37824": "But who could ever repay half the debt we owe you?",
  "37825": "Could he have thrown down the statue after he'd stripped the corpse?",
  "37826": "Shall we say in one hour's time?",
  "37827": "First of all, what did you see?",
  "37828": "Why, where ever did you go?",
  "37829": "You mean the rascals?",
  "37830": "Is it really calling us?",
  "37831": "Do they not think, they will have their own ends, and be truer to themselves, than to them?",
  "37832": "What humour's this?",
  "37833": "How about when you lose?",
  "37834": "But how about the new orbit in which we are moving?",
  "37835": "Shall I lead the way?",
  "37836": "Where was the poor devil to go?",
  "37837": "Would they not willingly sacrifice a little gift in order to obtain everlasting life?",
  "37838": "Where else could he have put it?",
  "37839": "Why are you explaining?",
  "37840": "Well, did he?",
  "37841": "What the deuce have you done with yourself this last month?",
  "37842": "Why should we load ourselves with a useless burden?",
  "37843": "Had he, beneath the childish face, already recognized the passionate, proud woman?",
  "37844": "What is the reward?",
  "37845": "Why, why, why, are there no harbours of refuge for grown men who have not yet lost them?",
  "37846": "To what good?",
  "37847": "Do you know why I came clear out here afoot?",
  "37848": "Is he dead?",
  "37849": "Look here, captain, to speak candidly, do you mean to say that there is anything marvelous in the occurrence?",
  "37850": "What was his purpose?",
  "37851": "There were brave men among them, but of what use was courage when their weapons were powerless against the monster?",
  "37852": "Who is this youth?",
  "37853": "Not named?",
  "37854": "How can we truly open the doors, and set free the full genius of our people?",
  "37855": "This what?",
  "37856": "But, it will be asked again, can we on these grounds, admit the existence of a wise and omnipotent author of the world?",
  "37857": "You have taken them away?",
  "37858": "Save it?",
  "37859": "To do with you, my lord?",
  "37860": "What boots it to deplore?",
  "37861": "How do you manage yours?",
  "37862": "What other dreadful things may happen, who can tell?",
  "37863": "How now, what noise is that?",
  "37864": "What is that house, then?",
  "37865": "Did he cut you out?",
  "37866": "You want to know the crime of which you are accused?",
  "37867": "How could we both be deceived?",
  "37868": "How was her girl to have guarded herself from a love so unfortunate, or have avoided the rock on which her vessel had been shipwrecked?",
  "37869": "Can it establish a maximum?",
  "37870": "You take a roundabout way, then, to inform me that I am very ill?",

  "38268": "Yet, what can the votary be justly said to have lost of his present happiness?",
  "38269": "Or what other reason can we ever assign for these affections, but the original fabric and formation of the human mind, which is naturally adapted to receive them?",
  "38270": "And yet, what is life worth to you if you be deprived of these enjoyments?",
  "38271": "What matters it, if you avoid them?",
  "38272": "You have had your eye on the business, my young friend, have you?",
  "38273": "And what are you going to buy for it?",
  "38274": "And therefore, previously?",
  "38275": "And long ago?",
  "38276": "A name?",
  "38277": "Or that induces the patriot to die for his country?",
  "38278": "To carry this accusing witness about with me everywhere?",
  "38279": "Then I must give up the idea?",
  "38280": "Is it intelligent?",
  "38281": "What good, pray, would this do you?",
  "38282": "How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love?",
  "38283": "Was it all real?",
  "38284": "Am I right behind, mama?",
  "38285": "George?",
  "38286": "But do you not admire, I said, the coolness and dexterity of these ready ministers of political corruption?",
  "38287": "Was he fair or dark?",
  "38288": "Would you?",
  "38289": "Do you agree to it?",
  "38290": "It was the cardinal, then, who informed you of this fete?",
  "38291": "Can you really remember it all?",
  "38292": "Angina?",
  "38293": "Then he said, she came from the country, he saw?",
  "38294": "And see the blue heron by the lotus flowers?",
  "38295": "Oh, you are, are you?",
  "38296": "Was it soil?",
  "38297": "Is it not a pitiful sight?",
  "38298": "D'you call life a bad job?",
  "38299": "You will not be my comforter, my rescuer?",
  "38300": "And who were the others?",
  "38301": "Do you understand?",
  "38302": "How much does he spend yearly?",
  "38303": "O, was it no otherwise?",
  "38304": "How could I doubt such a thing?",
  "38305": "How dare you cross my threshold?",
  "38306": "You'll like that?",
  "38307": "And is her name a secret?",
  "38308": "Uneasy?",
  "38309": "But how came you upon the roof, man?",
  "38310": "La sakes, now, does it?",
  "38311": "Hear you?",
  "38312": "Will they never cease to expect corn from tares, and figs from thistles?",
  "38313": "Why SHOULD you hold out forever?",
  "38314": "Then what was it?",
  "38315": "Else, why should it be let so cheaply?",
  "38316": "Is it possible that there can be many such people on earth?",
  "38317": "And might a man be thirsty, and yet unwilling to drink?",
  "38318": "What is the secret, then?",
  "38319": "But was it on her own account, or on account of another, that she exposed herself to such hazards?",
  "38320": "Shall I tell YOU?",
  "38321": "Whuzzamatter wiz you, hey?",
  "38322": "And you have heard his fortune mentioned?",
  "38323": "Is there in the world, anything outside of the tribunals, executory sentences, the police and the authorities?",
  "38324": "Yeobright?",
  "38325": "Do you accept the wager?",
  "38326": "Now, who the deuce do I know?",
  "38327": "Very well, sir, what next?",
  "38328": "Can it be possible to see anything equal to what we have seen?",
  "38329": "Ha, what is he, man?",
  "38330": "You are pretty strong, eh?",
  "38331": "Why such a large land army?",
  "38332": "What is it my father does not know?",
  "38333": "Is their spiritual condition, I often wonder, much higher than their physical one?",
  "38334": "Heard what?",
  "38335": "Shall I describe his life to you?",
  "38336": "Would they stop short at the hairy cuticle, or would they attack the brain?",
  "38337": "How long then?",
  "38338": "My letter?",
  "38339": "Is he as soft as ever?",
  "38340": "Where were you thinking of going?",
  "38341": "Do you hear the guns, pray?",
  "38342": "Should we not rather say JURISIGNORANCE?",
  "38343": "For what is it we call a man of birth, but one who is descended from a long succession of rich and powerful ancestors, and who acquires our esteem by his connexion with persons whom we esteem?",
  "38344": "But what about a thing like this?",
  "38345": "Was not that better than taking him prisoner?",
  "38346": "What was the name that he mentioned?",
  "38347": "Are you ready to be tested?",
  "38348": "How could I have exposed myself in their presence?",
  "38349": "Marguerite, CHERIE, what is it?",
  "38350": "Done?",
  "38351": "Why, have you not got any water?",
  "38352": "How could he hope to escape them?",
  "38353": "Here I have served him faithfully for years, and instead of allowing me to end my days comfortably and in peace, he is going to let me be cut up by the butcher, and my poor body is to be roasted and stewed and eaten?",
  "38354": "Now, how little do I look like being carried away trembling?",
  "38355": "To men who had risked their lives for him, and besides had done him a great service?",
  "38356": "Is it to be so?",
  "38357": "What other thing do you think I could dream of doing?",
  "38358": "Which house is it?",
  "38359": "By whom?",
  "38360": "But has the problem been well put?",
  "38361": "Could any thing in womanhood be so vile?",
  "38362": "There were two parts in our former scheme of education, were there not?",
  "38363": "Shall I tell you what I always think of you and the fortune yet to come for you, my love?",
  "38364": "Who is the fellow?",
  "38365": "Pleased to be thus undeceived, I laughed at his consternation, and asked what brought him thither?",
  "38366": "Was he losing his reason and thinking he heard things which were not for human ears?",
  "38367": "How far may the idler take advantage of the laborer?",
  "38368": "Why are you going?",
  "38369": "Perhaps you could stop stuffing your nostrils with that dirty snuff?",
  "38370": "What became of the whales in that time?",
  "38371": "Who could attempt to pursue him?",
  "38372": "Genius banished?",
  "38373": "How dare I?",
  "38374": "Well, prince, whom are we to suspect, then?",
  "38375": "I think you had some good reason for giving up the habit of going there?",
  "38376": "Is he mad, then, that mysterious old fellow?",
  "38377": "But what sort of a sailor are you?",
  "38378": "Who can resist them?",
  "38379": "You think the count will be angry with me?",
  "38380": "But where?",
  "38381": "Did you ever hear the like?",
  "38382": "Who is this man?",
  "38383": "Who wishes you would?",
  "38384": "Is he here now?",
  "38385": "What was it you said to me?",
  "38386": "You in bed?",
  "38387": "Am I wanted?",
  "38388": "How came you to be here?",
  "38389": "Can they have gone out?",
  "38390": "Is it of being poor, forsaken, wretched, that you accuse me?",
  "38391": "What was jour offence?",
  "38392": "Who forbade you?",
  "38393": "What is your name, my gentle angel?",
  "38394": "In the sunshine of the morning, beneath the wide, blue heavens, with a fresh wind astir, what fears, except the most desperate, can find a harbourage?",
  "38395": "So this is our minstrel?",
  "38396": "Yes, why should I stay here?",
  "38397": "Were you then permitted the use of pens, ink, and paper?",
  "38398": "A dog, for instance?",
  "38399": "Can the cannon support the shock of the pyroxyle?",
  "38400": "Have I ever done that?",
  "38401": "Was there any large school near?",
  "38402": "But are they rich?",
  "38403": "What decision did he come to?",
  "38404": "What am I to say to the creature?",
  "38405": "How would you like to be treated so?",
  "38406": "Is there any one closer to me nor you, or is it likely I'd be listening to stories brought against you?",
  "38407": "And can you not see, sir, the truth that's in me?",
  "38408": "Well, young fellow, are you glad to come to school?",
  "38409": "As how, good signior?",
  "38410": "Has not that been admitted?",
  "38411": "At a registrar's?",
  "38412": "Have you read this bulletin?",
  "38413": "He of whom I have such just apprehensions?",
  "38414": "Did a woman arrive at this place night before last?",
  "38415": "Does anything occur to yourself?",
  "38416": "Then what are they?",
  "38417": "Your father, eh?",
  "38418": "Have they not obeyed me?",
  "38419": "What have you got, broth, is it?",
  "38420": "Where are my amusements?",
  "38421": "What has a father to do with it?",
  "38422": "Do I take you with me?",
  "38423": "Do you understand the theory of that affair?",
  "38424": "Do you hear the way she'll be rating at your own self when a week is by?",
  "38425": "But, still, what sort of danger?",
  "38426": "No more than this?",
  "38427": "Where were the keys?",
  "38428": "Nobody know what this fudge can be?",
  "38429": "Come, what is it?",
  "38430": "Is loyalty too weak?",
  "38431": "What result, then, has ensued?",
  "38432": "Would not it be said by my presumptive remorse that, by my gallantry, manner and dress, I was going to seduce her?",
  "38433": "Never before?",
  "38434": "Did they try it on you?",
  "38435": "Are you thirsty?",
  "38436": "Will monseigneur give me the order?",
  "38437": "Would it not be well that he should put an end to himself, and thus escape?",
  "38438": "Is it not generous of him?",
  "38439": "What is the matter with you?",
  "38440": "You hear them when the window is open?",
  "38441": "You can?",
  "38442": "Now, what is the good of driblets?",
  "38443": "In fact, this bullet must have issued from a firearm, and who but a human being could have used such a weapon?",
  "38444": "Then you sat there like that, just you and she, all by yourselves?",
  "38445": "Why have I not seen you?",
  "38446": "Is the one right any better than the other?",
  "38447": "Am I cut off from the last fond pride of meanest shipwrecked captains?",
  "38448": "To which dialect was he indebted?",
  "38449": "Can you play on the piano?",
  "38450": "You have no money coming in on which you can rely?",
  "38451": "From such a kind family?",
  "38452": "Why did you leave us?",
  "38453": "Who was there among all whom she knew to whom she could appeal for sympathy?",
  "38454": "Well, and you?",
  "38455": "But what is it, then?",
  "38456": "But who, then was this man?",
  "38457": "Then they do not know it yet?",
  "38458": "Be so kind as to walk home with him, will you?",
  "38459": "Richard?",
  "38460": "What is a prison?",
  "38461": "Are you sure?",
  "38462": "Oh, will you be quiet, and help me to carry her?",
  "38463": "Have you not read your bulletin?",
  "38464": "Shall domestic manufactures be encouraged, and in what degree, by restrictions on foreign manufactures?",
  "38465": "Or shall we say they may be continued as long as the danger which occasioned their being raised continues?",
  "38466": "Can you tell me any ill he has done?",
  "38467": "What is government?",
  "38468": "How could I forget?",
  "38469": "But why should they suppose that I despise generals?",
  "38470": "So both the brothers escaped the common fate?",
  "38471": "Where are we to live?",
  "38472": "What reason do they give?",
  "38473": "Do you suppose I want to shoot myself?",
  "38474": "Whether they were always so free from avarice, partialities, or want, that a bribe, or some other sinister view, could have no place among them?",
  "38475": "Is it not good?",
  "38476": "Was that a trick to make me say which one I prefer?",
  "38477": "And get enchanted again?",
  "38478": "Why not, if what you assert is untrue?",
  "38479": "What's the odds where it comes from?",
  "38480": "Could she go back to the former quiet pleasures of those faraway days before the concert?",
  "38481": "Well, will you go if I change my clothes?",
  "38482": "Oh, he mentioned his name, did he?",
  "38483": "Can you let me sit by the fire?",
  "38484": "Then how?",
  "38485": "How is it possible to hear her?",
  "38486": "How are we going to get back?",
  "38487": "Need you say it face to face?",
  "38488": "Wooster?",
  "38489": "Will he get used to it?",
  "38490": "Who may the four be?",
  "38491": "Do I look as if I liked it?",
  "38492": "Then a man may feel for years that he is good solid company, and be wrong about himself after all?",
  "38493": "Are we only half way up?",
  "38494": "Pray, when, sir, shall I see you at my house?",
  "38495": "But when is this ball to take place?",
  "38496": "And my son?",
  "38497": "But will you gi'e me all the ground the goose flew over?",
  "38498": "Who denies you this right?",
  "38499": "What is the rule in such a case?",
  "38500": "Can you guess how he will be likely to behave towards his flatterers and his supposed parents, first of all during the period when he is ignorant of the false relation, and then again when he knows?",
  "38501": "If you see us among scores of women, will you look upon us?",
  "38502": "Where does the remainder go?",
  "38503": "Did any of you see him trailing us?",
  "38504": "And was he sure of what he said?",
  "38505": "I wrote to you for some grammars, if you recollect, and you sent them?",
  "38506": "But shall we go down and watch this absorbing match?",
  "38507": "My plans?",
  "38508": "Do you believe in my instinctive feelings?",
  "38509": "Are you sure I can get all the things I want there?",
  "38510": "On the front?",
  "38511": "Do you not see then, sire, that this is a covert and indirect accusation against yourself, and that while he praises pardoning love, he at the same time condemns and accuses your righteous and punitory wrath?",
  "38512": "Why weary, and palsy the arm at the oar, and the iron, and the lance?",
  "38513": "What difference did it make?",
  "38514": "Are my purposes wont to be so shallow?",
  "38515": "Have you had any tea, by the by?",
  "38516": "Who finds them?",
  "38517": "What are you doing there, my friend?",
  "38518": "Did you treat anybody, sir?",
  "38519": "And why was I running after her?",
  "38520": "What if the acts he had reconciled himself to because they made him a stronger instrument of the divine glory, were to become the pretext of the scoffer, and a darkening of that glory?",
  "38521": "Must I ever be on the way?",
  "38522": "But could you BEAR to have it swinging to your boat?",
  "38523": "Why, what's the reason, sir?",
  "38524": "What might I not get to know, nearly concerning you?",
  "38525": "What do they mean?",
  "38526": "What do they want?",
  "38527": "What is it like?",
  "38528": "And do you care?",
  "38529": "Count on my assistance?",
  "38530": "Where are they to be found?",
  "38531": "Must I always be the same?",
  "38532": "Why, pray, did you laugh at this?",
  "38533": "And were you warm?",
  "38534": "Where are we?",
  "38535": "If I told her all my fortune is lost?",
  "38536": "Who is a foolish man?",
  "38537": "What matter?",
  "38538": "Have you anything to say to me?",
  "38539": "Who are you?",
  "38540": "What was he doing?",
  "38541": "So you and the cardinal have been talking about me?",
  "38542": "Have we not botanical gardens?",
  "38543": "Why will you increase my distress by this groundless dispute?",
  "38544": "Is that called a funnel?",
  "38545": "Do they look like that sort of thing?",
  "38546": "How shall I ever repay you?",
  "38547": "Are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and reconciliation?",
  "38548": "Fwhat's she doin' outside?",
  "38549": "And what do you know about the state you talk of?",
  "38550": "Can any man of serious reflection hazard his future happiness upon the belief of a story naturally impossible, repugnant to every idea of decency, and related by persons already detected of falsehood?",
  "38551": "And why should I hesitate to betray that monster, sir?",
  "38552": "Nay, what is there that is not open to your very enemies?",
  "38553": "What is she to us?",
  "38554": "What are you?",
  "38555": "Am I to pay the piper?",
  "38556": "Who is this beauty and where is she to be seen, when she was not seen before till you saw her, if you did see her?",
  "38557": "Is it to do us some ill turn?",
  "38558": "What is it they're going to play?",
  "38559": "You wretch, eat up your visitors in your own house?",
  "38560": "Who's she?",
  "38561": "Where and when have you seen me trifle with a friend's heart and a king's life?",
  "38562": "Even when no one can hear us, may I, by no syllable, by none, not the slightest intimation, remind you of our love?",
  "38563": "Yes, it is a child, but who brought it here?",
  "38564": "Have you made anything out of the tangle?",
  "38565": "Am I to be left here in my old age, not a rational soul to speak to, and no other place in the village where there's a drop of decent punch to be had?",
  "38566": "What are you making such a fuss about?",
  "38567": "Well, then, whom does it concern?",
  "38568": "Do you not deduce something from that?",
  "38569": "But who could have taken it?",
  "38570": "One figure whose movements you follow with at least curiosity?",
  "38571": "One?",
  "38572": "What's to become of him?",
  "38573": "May I read it over again?",
  "38574": "How shall I ever mourn enough for all my kinsmen?",
  "38575": "Shall a man not come back to the loveliest lady in all the wide world?",
  "38576": "How long will you be with us?",
  "38577": "Does she know it?",
  "38578": "You heard of the duel?",
  "38579": "Can you show me the place as I go back?",
  "38580": "What else could I do?",
  "38581": "And do you think we have nothing to fear if we land?",
  "38582": "And are you going to make a fisherman of him?",
  "38583": "What kind of spectacle would its hidden hemisphere present to our terrestrial spheroid?",
  "38584": "Would you have doomed me, at any time, to the frost and blight that have hardened and spoiled me?",
  "38585": "A secret ambassador?",
  "38586": "Do you not constantly argue that this is not the right place to oppose it?",
  "38587": "Then you have some secret hope to buoy you up and please you with whispers of the future?",
  "38588": "And how should you understand him?",
  "38589": "A coward?",
  "38590": "What have you done about it?",
  "38591": "Do you know whom she reminds me of?",
  "38592": "The accusation?",
  "38593": "Now I ask, what idea do we form of these bodies or objects, to which we suppose solidity to belong?",
  "38594": "But am I in time?",
  "38595": "Will he not utterly hate a lie?",
  "38596": "Can you understand the happiness I get out of my absinthe?",
  "38597": "How know you that?",
  "38598": "Now?",
  "38599": "And what kind of fool?",
  "38600": "Casaubon?",
  "38601": "Is it KETCHING?",
  "38602": "Can you wash dishes right?",
  "38603": "But do they not rather demonstrate the absence of a gang?",
  "38604": "Do you think I'm a presumptuous fool?",
  "38605": "Why need I insist further?",
  "38606": "Is he a poet?",
  "38607": "Am I alive and a reality, or am I but a dream?",
  "38608": "Then the moon was once inhabited?",
  "38609": "Nothing the matter?",

  "38611": "But tell me, how does he produce the appearance of death?",
  "38612": "Know you what such a moment holds for me?",
  "38613": "Now, my ladies, you strike him not?",
  "38614": "Is that the idea?",
  "38615": "Will that be necessary?",
  "38616": "You're proud of them?",
  "38617": "Gone where?",
  "38618": "What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman?",
  "38619": "Did ever any one see such a fine piece of beef so completely ruined?",
  "38620": "Yea, is it so bad as that?",
  "38621": "Who does me this?",
  "38622": "And people think it so?",
  "38623": "Did the gentleman give a name?",
  "38624": "Were they then so soon to lose him whom they had snatched from an agonizing death?",
  "38625": "And what shall you do?",
  "38626": "But why so?",
  "38627": "He was disposed to interfere too much, was he?",
  "38628": "Hot and moist?",
  "38629": "Any guerrillas?",
  "38630": "Is he goodly enough?",
  "38631": "And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?",
  "38632": "He is a rebel, then?",
  "38633": "What were we who had strayed in here?",
  "38634": "Have I not sworn to you that I loved you in return?",
  "38635": "Had it struck on a submerged rock, or on an enormous wreck?",
  "38636": "But what if it all had been lost?",
  "38637": "Why had that man taken to flight on the arrival of the police, instead of entering a complaint?",
  "38638": "But the light?",
  "38639": "And what happens?",
  "38640": "Kindly?",
  "38641": "But what step would you propose to me?",
  "38642": "Why should you want to spite her?",
  "38643": "Can men refuse to be pleased with words of gentle advice?",
  "38644": "And just actions cause justice, and unjust actions cause injustice?",
  "38645": "Shall he live?",
  "38646": "Do you think he can last till morning?",
  "38647": "What, if I am steeped in poverty?",
  "38648": "An advice?",
  "38649": "No one?",
  "38650": "Is it in this mode that the spirit of mutual support and common effort for the common good, is to be cultivated?",
  "38651": "You will not do that?",
  "38652": "Oh, what are you doing?",
  "38653": "Where is the corpse lying?",
  "38654": "Is not this so?",
  "38655": "How many of their friends must have fallen in the struggle?",
  "38656": "Do you see this woman sitting beside me?",
  "38657": "And when you see the same evils in the tyrannical man, what do you say of him?",

  "39039": "But, in admitting that the sun does not go out, might it not happen that the earth might move away from it?",
  "39040": "Do you mean where have I been while supper was getting ready?",
  "39041": "So, you will go?",

  "39049": "Have you weaned her yet?",
  "39050": "Is there still no end to the bloodshed?",
  "39051": "Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up to the grand northern lights?",
  "39052": "Do you believe there is a consideration in the world that would induce her to take such a step against her favourite son?",
  "39053": "What is he looking at?",
  "39054": "But was not her father the head of the community?",
  "39055": "How could you be so careless?",
  "39056": "What are we to do?",
  "39057": "How is your life in danger here?",
  "39058": "Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?",
  "39059": "Again, upon the supposition that the soul is a harmony, why is one soul better than another?",
  "39060": "How did I deserve such pay?",

  "39066": "Andy, where's your gun?",
  "39067": "So much as that?",
  "39068": "And have whole streams of blood been spilt in vain?",
  "39069": "But what is there to say about me?",
  "39070": "How were we going to begin to bring order out of this chaos?",
  "39071": "Do you recognize the carriage?",
  "39072": "Why was she stumbling about amongst the rubble and catching her dress in brambles and burrs?",

  "39093": "But where to now?",
  "39094": "Aramis here?",
  "39095": "How can you imagine it, since he has so lately declined everything from you?",
  "39096": "And what for?",
  "39097": "There's no likelihood of her running away or eloping?",
  "39098": "But who can see her as I have seen, who can know what her life has been, and not love her?",
  "39099": "Do you think any hint has reached her?",

  "39124": "Do you mean to state what your complaint against this boy is, man, or do you not?",
  "39125": "Now what?",
  "39126": "What did he see?",
  "39127": "Is it not the rushing of the wolves you have mentioned?",
  "39128": "For what?",
  "39129": "Should he impose his galleys on those two dazzling children, or should he consummate his irremediable engulfment by himself?",
  "39130": "What mercies or what sins of men are you talking of?",
  "39131": "Do you require the word?",
  "39132": "What place and what season can be goodlier than this?",
  "39133": "To what do you allude, monsieur?",

  "39144": "Have you heard the news?",
  "39145": "Will you kindly tell us which way your mother went to get on top the earth?",
  "39146": "Is that what you have made of him?",
  "39147": "It feels nervous and strange to be coming here again after all these years?",
  "39148": "Who was she that he danced with?",
  "39149": "How many persons is the prison built to hold?",
  "39150": "But what can he do?",
  "39151": "And what are those words THERE, on THAT line?",

  "39153": "How is it pointing?",
  "39154": "Change places with him, and would you have been looked at by those blue eyes as he was, and commiserated by that agitated face as he was?",
  "39155": "Is that your conclusion, lieutenant?",
  "39156": "What qualities have you, my friend, which would make your services so valuable?",
  "39157": "And may we not say the same of all things?",
  "39158": "And then if we look at things from a still more lofty point of view, why do we speak of civil war?",
  "39159": "Where did her dignity come from?",
  "39160": "Do you know what the question is here?",
  "39161": "Why, what harm was there in that?",

  "39169": "Are you mad, to talk to me thus?",
  "39170": "How is it that from beauty I have derived a type of unloveliness?",
  "39171": "Does his island produce him such a revenue?",
  "39172": "Can he give any definition of it, that will not be the same with that of causation?",
  "39173": "For two good names, hey?",

  "39189": "Must I do that?",
  "39190": "How is that all too brief period spent at present?",
  "39191": "What do we here?",
  "39192": "Been back long?",
  "39193": "Lyon?",
  "39194": "What more is to be said?",
  "39195": "You would, would you?",
  "39196": "What do you mean by special privileges?",
  "39197": "And pray, what sort of a road may that be?",
  "39198": "I?",
  "39199": "And what do those girls do?",

  "39201": "Why should I spare him?",
  "39202": "How happens it, if man is good, that he has not succeeded in levelling by his goodness this wholly metaphysical obstacle, and that, instead of strengthening the fraternal tie that binds men, pitiless necessity breaks it?",
  "39203": "But how can the steersman follow the route in the middle of the waters?",
  "39204": "Go long, will ye?",

  "40212": "Sir, you are tempting me?",
  "40213": "But should we not find any fisherman and should the wind shift to the north?",
  "40214": "Is it in such a situation, with such notions, that the sentiments of nature unfold themselves, or habits of education become mild and peaceful?",
  "40215": "What feed shall I use?",
  "40216": "Then it's a very merry place, I suppose?",
  "40217": "Suppose the queen should refuse to ratify it?",
  "40218": "And how could you have hoped to escape, after you had struck me thus in the midst of my soldiers?",
  "40219": "Did not I say that things would come right of themselves?",
  "40220": "O how could they laugh about it that way?",
  "40221": "And why is it contrary, unless it be more shocking than any delicate satire?",
  "40222": "What, then?",
  "40223": "And why does your mother say so?",
  "40224": "Do you know my crime, my lord?",
  "40225": "Had he failed?",
  "40226": "Why was it bad?",
  "40227": "His luggage?",
  "40228": "Do you intend opening the door?",
  "40229": "Lui, marchand?",
  "40230": "Then what are you going to look for?",
  "40231": "But now what is to be done?",
  "40232": "Is he convicted of robbery?",
  "40233": "Were my parents so, when they gave me to you?",
  "40234": "They do me no harm, I hope?",
  "40235": "Could it be possible?",
  "40236": "And we start in his carriage, then?",
  "40237": "Why in thunder should anyone follow or watch me?",
  "40238": "Is my house come to that?",
  "40239": "But you are not so much so on my account?",
  "40240": "Do you want to see me in the prisoner's dock with criminals, in a court of justice?",
  "40241": "Seventeen, you mean?",
  "40242": "I am told it is a delightful place?",
  "40243": "You heard about that, I suppose?",
  "40244": "What did he do yesterday?",
  "40245": "What madness or folly leads me to speak of the faults of others, when there is so much to be said about my own?",
  "40246": "Was he rehearsing some speech in his sleep, or was it a fragment of a phrase from some newspaper article?",
  "40247": "Why do we hold ourselves under obligations to pass such a law, and abide by it when it is passed?",
  "40248": "Are fires kindled on graves, why, and at what time, and for how long?",
  "40249": "Might I have expected it?",
  "40250": "Who had placed those rocks and stones like cromlechs of prehistoric times?",
  "40251": "Is it heaven that opens before me?",
  "40252": "So you'd have them burned?",
  "40253": "What is that noise?",
  "40254": "Excellency, how could I, how could I prevent it?",
  "40255": "Do you know what they do?",
  "40256": "How long?",
  "40257": "Why spoil the pleasure of our friends by inflicting on them fashionable toilettes on this day of vigorous exercise in the country?",
  "40258": "Why are you the officer in charge now?",
  "40259": "You like music too?",
  "40260": "ARE we safe?",
  "40261": "Would it suit you to see them in the darkness of the night?",
  "40262": "Or doth it sit behind a big stone and catch flies?",
  "40263": "And then will he slay me?",
  "40264": "Regarding that as done, is there nothing I can do for you yourself?",
  "40265": "If he wished to injure it why could he not do it there?",
  "40266": "And it turned out that it was not at all because of you he was taken up?",
  "40267": "Why, pray, did you not tell me this, then, but excited with hopes a rustic and aged man?",
  "40268": "Is she HERE?",
  "40269": "The cowardliest?",
  "40270": "Would the doctor assist him in preventing this marriage?",
  "40271": "Is there?",
  "40272": "Yes, but are you good enough for it?",
  "40273": "To seek me?",
  "40274": "It is not he, is it?",
  "40275": "What is life?",
  "40276": "The very course he swung to this day noon?",
  "40277": "Now, what is the difference between such actions, when performed by an uncultivated man, and by one of the higher animals?",
  "40278": "And had I not been miserable with less dishonor, if I had met with a more severe and inhuman enemy?",
  "40279": "Have they fed him?",
  "40280": "But who knows whether then you will still wish to elevate him whom you now love, to be your husband?",
  "40281": "Is there no other road?",
  "40282": "Do you mean a whopper?",
  "40283": "Easy you think, eh?",
  "40284": "And your present happiness, has it softened your heart?",
  "40285": "How dare you think of staying here one moment, and refuse my wife the honours that belong to her as such?",
  "40286": "Anyone else?",
  "40287": "And why did I rush off to him just now like a lunatic, and drag him back here?",
  "40288": "Of spiritual profit?",
  "40289": "What is this bird?",
  "40290": "A professor?",
  "40291": "How are we to know whither chance will carry us?",
  "40292": "Are you stopping here?",
  "40293": "Or which must end me, a fool's wrath or love?",
  "40294": "Now, has she deserved this punishment?",
  "40295": "And may I not paint one like it for you?",
  "40296": "Why?",
  "40297": "What on earth will they expect me to talk about?",
  "40298": "Are you strong enough to stand?",
  "40299": "So I may give him your word of honour, may I, that in case of extremity you will stand by her?",
  "40300": "Would that do?",
  "40301": "You fear to see my naked blade?",
  "40302": "My idea?",
  "40303": "Why is she unhappy, I wonder?",
  "40304": "May I use it?",
  "40305": "Have I ever seen one?",
  "40306": "Months?",
  "40307": "You have abandoned the king?",
  "40308": "Where were you when you began to feel bad?",
  "40309": "Who let you loose?",
  "40310": "Is any one the less ill because one does not know the name of one's malady?",
  "40311": "I ridiculous?",
  "40312": "Are you armed?",
  "40313": "But may there not be a more or less vague and evanescent sense of tension, and some psychic fact which may be regarded as the shadowy forerunner of the consciousness of the release of tension which, on a higher plane, reveals itself as the consciousness of will?",
  "40314": "Do you know me, madame?",
  "40315": "Crack my son over the head, will you, you hardhearted, murtherin' divil?",
  "40316": "By what wickedness cometh this child here?",
  "40317": "Was he feeling badly?",
  "40318": "Is not this the most profound ignorance of human nature?",
  "40319": "Do you think I should remember all about my mother's death if I were out of my mind?",
  "40320": "Do you forget that?",
  "40321": "And if each proprietor is sovereign lord within the sphere of his property, absolute king throughout his own domain, how could a government of proprietors be any thing but chaos and confusion?",
  "40322": "Was it very edifying and instructive?",
  "40323": "Must this last formality take place in your presence, sir?",
  "40324": "Who knows, when I shall be at liberty, that I may not satisfy your curiosity?",
  "40325": "Was it the devil who rang it?",
  "40326": "Is it unfaithfulness to my husband?",
  "40327": "The train is at three?",
  "40328": "Did you ever see me carry dishes?",
  "40329": "How is such a man to be worked on?",
  "40330": "What murderous spectacle is this?",
  "40331": "What do you suggest?",
  "40332": "Have you nothing to show your cousin anywhere about, not even a rabbit or a weasel's nest?",
  "40333": "Have you ever heard of him?",
  "40334": "Had he not corn enough?",
  "40335": "What weapons shall you select?",
  "40336": "Mamma, how can you go back in that way?",
  "40337": "Then no misfortune has happened to you?",
  "40338": "Is the island inhabited then?",
  "40339": "Who's that curtseying there?",
  "40340": "What happens?",
  "40341": "You have plenty of vermin to deal with, I suppose?",
  "40342": "You have news for me?",
  "40343": "Are we not arriving too late?",
  "40344": "Is he not?",
  "40345": "Outside?",
  "40346": "Can it be possible we could be like husband and wife, alone, your family with you?",
  "40347": "What is the matter with him?",
  "40348": "Dare I look at her?",
  "40349": "Do you make money or do you not make it?",
  "40350": "I had seen the man robbed, what else could I have done?",
  "40351": "You're not sending the horses off yet?",
  "40352": "What atones?",
  "40353": "What shall we do exactly?",
  "40354": "Why does she say that?",
  "40355": "What do you advise me to do?",
  "40356": "And therefore to acknowledge that bad and good are the same?",
  "40357": "Shall I tell him to wait?",
  "40358": "What do we find?",
  "40359": "Is that right?",
  "40360": "Well, my dear, and how are we getting on?",
  "40361": "How many men have you here?",
  "40362": "What are you going as?",
  "40363": "You mean if there's a weak place?",
  "40364": "WHAT OUGHT I TO DO?",
  "40365": "Does he know I am his mother really?",
  "40366": "May I make a compact with you?",
  "40367": "Who and what are the two men of whom you speak?",
  "40368": "What are you saying, doctor?",
  "40369": "Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I WAS uncivil?",
  "40370": "Did you find him?",
  "40371": "Where is he?",
  "40372": "And since when have you become afraid of a quarrel?",
  "40373": "Where are they taking you to, you poor dear?",
  "40374": "Why, how wet it is?",
  "40375": "Suppose he finds out, and your brother, and your betrothed?",
  "40376": "Did he give any explanation of his conduct?",
  "40377": "Corcoran?",
  "40378": "How ever did you get along in a sledge?",
  "40379": "Ah, indeed?",
  "40380": "Does it exist?",
  "40381": "How many?",
  "40382": "In what manner?",
  "40383": "Will it drive me out of my mind?",
  "40384": "Pretty?",
  "40385": "Well, have you seen him?",
  "40386": "Is this one also a complementary colour?",
  "40387": "Farebrother?",
  "40388": "I wonder who he was?",
  "40389": "And when can I see this young lady, for whom I already feel so great a sympathy?",
  "40390": "Let him profit by the means as I found out?",
  "40391": "What's that about six pound a year?",
  "40392": "What is it, then, sire?",
  "40393": "You are quite sure that you do not want to sell your land?",
  "40394": "How are delights and miseries to be weighed, and reasonably balanced?",
  "40395": "In exchange for that you refuse me?",
  "40396": "Are you going to tell me that it is impossible?",
  "40397": "May I look?",
  "40398": "And what did you learn from him?",
  "40399": "How was the play?",
  "40400": "But does it shut equally well?",
  "40401": "What's yo' name?",
  "40402": "How near do you get to it?",
  "40403": "And who is the magistrate who has reason to complain of the agent?",
  "40404": "Who are you talking of?",
  "40405": "I wonder if I shall ever be happy enough to have real lace on my clothes and bows on my caps?",
  "40406": "Come, now?",
  "40407": "Marry whom?",
  "40408": "Was it not unhealthful?",
  "40409": "What happened during the night?",
  "40410": "If two and two made four when we were happy together, surely they make four now?",
  "40411": "How near to you?",
  "40412": "Has the queen any further commands for me now?",
  "40413": "May it not frighten her terribly?",
  "40414": "Are the oysters good?",
  "40415": "Which colour strikes most?",
  "40416": "When the devil would you have a man be afraid but when there is so much cause?",
  "40417": "But what happened ?",
  "40418": "But how came that first note to be inserted in your journal?",
  "40419": "Then addressing herself to me, asked, with ineffable complacency, if I was the person who had been so cruelly used by robbers?",
  "40420": "But why could he not tell you this?",
  "40421": "Unseen then?",
  "40422": "Will you give me an egg to eat?",
  "40423": "Would she ever live to see it?",
  "40424": "A cart?",
  "40425": "Will you sell your rapier?",
  "40426": "What is the reader's conceived opinion of the duties and labors of a missionary in a heathen land?",
  "40427": "But if his daily death was the theme of the legend, why was it celebrated by an annual ceremony?",
  "40428": "Old fellow, can you let me have thirty pounds?",
  "40429": "How do you manage to get people to talk about it?",
  "40430": "Did not you see me tip you the wink to leave off in time?",
  "40431": "Rid myself of that nightmare?",
  "40432": "Could there possibly have been a more exact guide?",
  "40433": "Why, do you think I should be any happier if I were to feel disturbed about the excavations you tell me of?",
  "40434": "But how am I to climb?",
  "40435": "What is your love to mine?",
  "40436": "Love covers a multitude of sins, and of whom could you ask more freely than of him?",
  "40437": "And who is she, this woman that you want to see?",
  "40438": "Still, are they going to do it shortly?",
  "40439": "And of what other trees?",
  "40440": "May we not conjecture that they belonged to the people who resided in the town, and who were victorious in the engagement?",
  "40441": "Could a man be born to a more perfect glory?",
  "40442": "You are vexed?",
  "40443": "You'll not say anything about it at home, will you?",
  "40444": "To our journey's end?",
  "40445": "To what unexpected good fortune, to what accident, am I to ascribe this happy meeting?",
  "40446": "How did it fare with the missions in these days of woe and terror?",
  "40447": "And how is everybody?",
  "40448": "With what object?",
  "40449": "Or is it the matter?",
  "40450": "Do you wish a step, or some place in the government?",
  "40451": "Would it not be better to rest now?",
  "40452": "But what then?",
  "40453": "Am I right or not?",
  "40454": "It is agreed, then, that I carry you off with me?",
  "40455": "Quite seriously?",
  "40456": "Who should prevent you?",
  "40457": "The vastness of this word?",
  "40458": "Whose horse is waiting at your gate?",
  "40459": "Why did you light the thirsty lamp?",
  "40460": "Would he be in time to rescue?",
  "40461": "How did he come to be there?",
  "40462": "The meeting?",
  "40463": "Why do you look first on one side and then on the other, as if you were afraid of being arrested yourself, you whose business it is to arrest others?",
  "40464": "Will your majesty deign to excuse me?",
  "40465": "Shall we say it is because we have won an empire?",
  "40466": "What do you talk about?",
  "40467": "How can his readers take on trust his statements concerning the births, marriages, divorces, and deaths of a crowd of people, whose names are scarcely known to this generation?",
  "40468": "Or why should not all the three walk abreast?",
  "40469": "And is it so, maidy?",
  "40470": "Were they hungry?",
  "40471": "Do your ears tell you that they have traced our retreat?",
  "40472": "What made you sit in such an awkward position?",
  "40473": "Is not this the way in which the large landed proprietors have gradually raised their rents, as fast as they have ascertained by the increase in population and the development of industry how much society can produce from their property?",
  "40474": "Why are you so very shy, and so very sombre?",
  "40475": "What other initiative, what greater authority, do you ask?",
  "40476": "Why do you serve in this capacity?",
  "40477": "What month?",
  "40478": "More than in other years?",
  "40479": "But could he be sure that this was all that was to be said about this enigma, and that he should never arrive at a solution?",
  "40480": "Half a mile, you say?",
  "40481": "Has anything happened, ma'am?",
  "40482": "Where is the man who brought the letter?",
  "40483": "Whither am I going?",
  "40484": "Shall I have it, or shall I not?",
  "40485": "And all my limbs unbroken?",
  "40486": "Why did they?",
  "40487": "Do you know where we could get one?",
  "40488": "Well, and you want your fortune told?",
  "40489": "Was it his wife, or else as like her as any sister could be?",
  "40490": "Does that mean that all men have a right to all property?",
  "40491": "And can bear to have my morsel of bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my cup?",
  "40492": "One thing and another commit?",
  "40493": "Can you tell me, this last time, that you feel quite, quite sure, no new affections of mine, and no new duties of mine, will ever interpose between us?",
  "40494": "You remember all this quite clearly, but how is it that your reason calmly accepted all the manifest absurdities and impossibilities that crowded into your dream?",
  "40495": "What troops are these that seem to be passing through the wood?",
  "40496": "You'd never think it to look at me, would you?",
  "40497": "Is there no gentleman or lady of virtue in this neighbourhood, to whom I may fly, only till l can find a way to get to my poor father and mother?",
  "40498": "What object could they have?",
  "40499": "And do you suppose she understands nothing?",
  "40500": "Could I have caused that girl's death and procreated this being?",
  "40501": "Well, sir?",
  "40502": "And I must cross it with silver, I suppose?",
  "40503": "A letter?",
  "40504": "Whom follow?",
  "40505": "What means this profession of faith?",
  "40506": "Again, if the uncooling or warm principle were imperishable, the fire when assailed by cold would not have perished or have been extinguished, but would have gone away unaffected?",
  "40507": "His wife?",
  "40508": "What place is that?",
  "40509": "Is not this thing which you advise me to do a little cowardly?",
  "40510": "Who has paid adulation to the nation while claiming for it a sovereignty which it was incapable of exercising?",
  "40511": "Have you not wished to go?",
  "40512": "Died he of sickness or through treachery?",
  "40513": "To how much?",
  "40514": "Why, why are people all balls of bitter dust?",
  "40515": "You tell me nothing?",
  "40516": "What means this?",
  "40517": "Who calls?",
  "40518": "Why should I deny it?",
  "40519": "What is the matter with them?",
  "40520": "Is it not inconceivable, that a tribune should have power to imprison a consul, and the people have no authority to degrade him when he uses that honor which he received from them, to their detriment?",
  "40521": "Now, children, which is it to be?",
  "40522": "Is the doctrine warranted by FACTS?",
  "40523": "Then what will you do with me then?",
  "40524": "Can anyone grasp what such an offer meant at such a spot, made to a man who, to tell the truth, is very fond of a smoke after meals?",
  "40525": "From whom had they that information?",
  "40526": "Then your duchess is still at the waters?",
  "40527": "Have you heard anything of the case?",
  "40528": "Do you wish to try to do so?",
  "40529": "After all, he said in his bitterness, what can a woman care about so much as house and furniture?",
  "40530": "What was his devotion worth to her?",
  "40531": "I suppose I could walk with the rest?",
  "40532": "But why waste more words on them?",
  "40533": "What was it fell last night from the evil moon?",
  "40534": "Just as she was, in a manner, pretending to listen?",
  "40535": "Two words?",
  "40536": "It was he who told you to invite me to appear with these studs?",
  "40537": "And how were they treated?",
  "40538": "Do you bring me a message from the king, or have you made a bold hit, and wish me to take you again under my protection?",
  "40539": "How many times have we seen it?",
  "40540": "Well, then, what possessed you to go down there this time of night?",
  "40541": "And do you know who is his lieutenant?",
  "40542": "I suppose that's what your humanity would suggest?",
  "40543": "How long a delay do you wish for?",
  "40544": "Well, what will you give for it?",
  "40545": "But should you not interfere?",
  "40546": "Mademoiselle, how could you believe that?",
  "40547": "You mean it makes you feel that you have nothing?",
  "40548": "But what about women?",
  "40549": "Besides, how could one land on the opposite bank among willows which would scuttle the boat, and with a flood of unknown extent?",
  "40550": "Have I, indeed, said anything you should answer with such a cruel remark?",
  "40551": "What hinders it?",
  "40552": "So what have you done with it?",
  "40553": "What is there to surprise anyone in that?",
  "40554": "If I only had it here, wretch that I am, what more should we want?",
  "40555": "Well, monseigneur?",
  "40556": "Do you wish me to begin admiring the peoples?",
  "40557": "Do I not myself know that I am at this moment in want of a dozen pages, and that I am sick with cudgelling my brains to find them?",
  "40558": "Did you observe any one during the first act?",
  "40559": "Have you heard the news?",
  "40560": "Why deceive us further?",
  "40561": "And by whom are you forbidden?",
  "40562": "And who was that man?",
  "40563": "What happened to you?",
  "40564": "What put her up to clearing out?",
  "40565": "Well, sire?",
  "40566": "Any answer?",
  "40567": "How do you do?",
  "40568": "And so, is it quite certain he is coming?",
  "40569": "If nobody were rich, who would employ the poor?",
  "40570": "And what do you expect the king to reply?",
  "40571": "Where is he who could say it no?",
  "40572": "I have surely not been dreaming, have I?",
  "40573": "Shall we light a fire, so as to signal our presence on the coast?",
  "40574": "Do you think of dying, my lord?",
  "40575": "What do you believe, what do you KNOW?",
  "40576": "How's my poor brother?",
  "40577": "Is he so hard, then?",
  "40578": "Why did you come?",
  "40579": "Oh, mother, what is the matter?",
  "40580": "And what house is this?",
  "40581": "Will fish go down with them?",
  "40582": "May it not, theoretically, include as much of the universe as is known to man?",
  "40583": "Is it my affair?",
  "40584": "I, madame?",
  "40585": "Who is this ancient teacher or who is his prototype if he is an ideal being?",
  "40586": "What could those words mean?",
  "40587": "Did you never do any robbery in your life?",
  "40588": "What devil?",
  "40589": "Why are we less prompt to provide for our own safety than the rest of the citizens?",
  "40590": "I said, do you hear me?",
  "40591": "Is his hour past?",
  "40592": "Do you know of any other?",
  "40593": "For how, under different wills, should we find complete unity of ends?",
  "40594": "Did you ever see anything to equal it, as you steam away in the sunset?",
  "40595": "Were you thinking of your birth then?",
  "40596": "Look at a plant in the midst of its range, why does it not double or quadruple its numbers?",
  "40597": "Am I too heavy?",
  "40598": "Shall we agree to this plan, or not?",
  "40599": "Do they begin by exciting the detestation of the very instruments of their intended usurpations?",
  "40600": "Up so early?",
  "40601": "Do I know you?",
  "40602": "His things and his bag are with him?",
  "40603": "Another shock, eh?",
  "40604": "Can I trust you?",
  "40605": "Other people's?",
  "40606": "And fought?",
  "40607": "Was there no other who contributed?",
  "40608": "Under what obligation do I lie of making such an abuse of time?",
  "40609": "Could any other man express what they knew so well how to express in tones and in words?",
  "40610": "But what book is that next it?",
  "40611": "It surely cannot be you who made shoes for me at the l'ecole militaire?",
  "40612": "But how, sir, said I, did you part?",
  "40613": "Where was the first lion?",
  "40614": "What is its name?",
  "40615": "That is, you mean that sin keeps him back?",
  "40616": "To whom was this letter addressed?",
  "40617": "Carlo, did I offer any violence?",
  "40618": "But if there be anything which is of such a nature as to be and not to be, that will have a place intermediate between pure being and the absolute negation of being?",
  "40619": "Who are your uncles and aunts?",
  "40620": "What was he saying yesterday?",
  "40621": "If much comfort cannot be expected from the friendship of a reformed rake of superior abilities, what is the consequence when he lacketh sense, as well as principles?",
  "40622": "And do you think I ever shall?",
  "40623": "Why do you want me?",
  "40624": "I ask you what year is it?",
  "40625": "What sent you hither?",
  "40626": "Was such a thing ever heard of?",
  "40627": "What had she to do with the justice or injustice of other people?",
  "40628": "Which is it to be, death or life?",
  "40629": "How will they proceed?",
  "40630": "Not a cloud?",
  "40631": "What has that boy been about?",
  "40632": "Or any other time?",
  "40633": "Are they not already in the land?",
  "40634": "What did they want there?",
  "40635": "To which?",
  "40636": "The surface of a sphere?",
  "40637": "Are they happy?",
  "40638": "Is it a good road, and how far?",
  "40639": "And the lord chamberlain?",
  "40640": "Mayor?",
  "40641": "Had you ever any reason to complain of him?",
  "40642": "Will you promise me then to be at peace?",
  "40643": "A voyage?",
  "40644": "And they found the child?",
  "40645": "Yet what will the energy of true genius not effect?",
  "40646": "What is there to hinder?",
  "40647": "Is it a lonely farm?",
  "40648": "And can I play with him, too?",
  "40649": "Why do I want to go?",
  "40650": "What business, said she, had you to read my letter?",
  "40651": "Or, if it ought to give any, what are the different parts of education which it ought to attend to in the different orders of the people?",
  "40652": "What time did he set off for town?",
  "40653": "And are you coming with us?",
  "40654": "When had that question been settled?",
  "40655": "Had he travelled?",
  "40656": "And why have you such an air of sadness aboard?",
  "40657": "Was it an instant of enchantment only or long hours and years and ages?",
  "40658": "Is the lady so very alarming?",
  "40659": "And how is it possible to help losing a stronghold that is not relieved, above all when surrounded by a host of determined enemies in their own country?",
  "40660": "Your marriage?",
  "40661": "Your aunt?",
  "40662": "By means of what organ?",
  "40663": "What DOES the face matter?",
  "40664": "All of it?",
  "40665": "Is he lost, I wonder, in this desert?",
  "40666": "Can you enlighten me on that point?",
  "40667": "What makes her want to see ye?",
  "40668": "Are you quite well?",
  "40669": "And what this?",
  "40670": "Did not his land produce sufficient of everything?",
  "40671": "When did it break out?",
  "40672": "Why add up the elements of resistance and anarchy?",
  "40673": "And pray, if you are so good, who ventures to affirm that?",
  "40674": "What for?",
  "40675": "What are you thinking of doing?",
  "40676": "How could we live and where could we live?",
  "40677": "But what do I say?",
  "40678": "Whom does this belong to?",
  "40679": "Who are you, my good man?",
  "40680": "Had I dreamt?",
  "40681": "Why did she so lose courage?",
  "40682": "And can you not understand why I said fortune favours us?",
  "40683": "What's the use of living?",
  "40684": "Are you well and happy?",
  "40685": "What to do?",
  "40686": "Did the sun, which shone so brightly everywhere else, really fall upon him?",
  "40687": "And if there is truth in what has preceded, he will be wedded to an image of pleasure which is thrice removed as to truth from the pleasure of the oligarch?",
  "40688": "What brings you here, dear heart?",
  "40689": "You understand what I say?",
  "40690": "Will it be said that the opposition between man and the divine being is illusory, and that it arises from the opposition that exists between the individual man and the essence of entire humanity?",
  "40691": "Are they in safety?",
  "40692": "I'm not?",
  "40693": "Have you forgotten that a son ought to love and honour his father and mother?",
  "40694": "Had the remembrance of her teaching utterly vanished, and the last trace of her maternal influence quite faded away?",
  "40695": "You are staying the whole evening, I hope?",
  "40696": "What weight would that carry?",
  "40697": "Good gracious, what noise is that?",
  "40698": "Have you seen the princess?",
  "40699": "Is it because there is no word tender enough to be your name?",
  "40700": "Did it not show that he comprehended his relations with her?",
  "40701": "What need of positive law where natural justice is, of itself, a sufficient restraint?",
  "40702": "But how was it settled between you, mamma?",
  "40703": "What means this?",
  "40704": "What is it that is strange?",
  "40705": "Coming in to have a short time?",
  "40706": "Do you reproach me?",
  "40707": "And what do you pick your teeth with, after devouring that fat goose?",
  "40708": "Had not his books taught him that he was a man?",
  "40709": "And will you mention to me the yearly sum which would repay you for managing these affairs which we have discussed together?",
  "40710": "But then, what are we here for?",
  "40711": "You have?",
  "40712": "De qui?",
  "40713": "What was it, my dear?",
  "40714": "She was young, you say?",
  "40715": "His effect?",
  "40716": "What is life to you?",
  "40717": "Where are you living now?",
  "40718": "Have they?",
  "40719": "Shall my messenger, in your name, tell your people to give in?",
  "40720": "And does he still tip you?",
  "40721": "If he forsakes his faith, how doth it profit you?",
  "40722": "Why do you do such a strange thing?",
  "40723": "Why did you think so?",
  "40724": "Does he say so now?",
  "40725": "And both should be in harmony?",
  "40726": "Why, you love him, do you not?",
  "40727": "I hope I am doing nothing wrong in asking it again?",
  "40728": "Had he spoken of himself, of himself as he was or wished to be?",
  "40729": "If he did not, what would she do?",
  "40730": "And ought not the same natures to have the same pursuits?",
  "40731": "What next?",
  "40732": "Why did it happen?",
  "40733": "But our troop horses?",
  "40734": "Nay, tell me, how many histories are there filled with these marvels?",
  "40735": "Do you mind my smoking?",
  "40736": "How, then, does this passion for gain, abandoned to itself, turn to the prejudice of society?",
  "40737": "If a kiss had been imprinted?",
  "40738": "Well, do you attend the function tonight?",
  "40739": "But they have wisdom, else what is the use of having died?",
  "40740": "Have I given no testimony of my sincerity and of my passion?",
  "40741": "That's everything?",
  "40742": "Is this the same lemonade of which you partook?",
  "40743": "But the horses?",
  "40744": "In summer?",
  "40745": "And what the devil was the matter with his head?",
  "40746": "Why do we love?",
  "40747": "And what do the rulers call the people?",
  "40748": "And how much was the residue?",
  "40749": "What do you think he replied?",
  "40750": "Or is it equally criminal in every body?",
  "40751": "Perhaps you think I shall abandon you, dear grandpapa, and that I shall forget you when I am married?",
  "40752": "Suppose we had attained our end, would it not have been better to have found continents in broad daylight than a country plunged in utter darkness?",
  "40753": "Did your father speak of it?",
  "40754": "What was that noise?",
  "40755": "What made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here?",
  "40756": "An old hag who said her son had the plague?",
  "40757": "How then was it closed?",
  "40758": "But, if from their birth men and women are placed in a torrid zone, with the meridian sun of pleasure darting directly upon them, how can they sufficiently brace their minds to discharge the duties of life, or even to relish the affections that carry them out of themselves?",
  "40759": "What is the cause of all this?",
  "40760": "What do I seek on the height?",
  "40761": "Have the enemy called in any foreign help?",
  "40762": "Lost her memory, eh?",
  "40763": "And pray who are the persons who exhaust your fortune?",
  "40764": "You did not recognise me?",
  "40765": "How shall I break through them?",
  "40766": "That your own bunk over on that side?",
  "40767": "Is this a fact?",
  "40768": "But where, where was this self, this innermost part, this ultimate part?",
  "40769": "What have I to consider?",
  "40770": "Had she succeeded in extracting the secret, and awakening in that adamant heart a last faint touch of pity?",
  "40771": "And will you transfer me to your brother?",
  "40772": "Indeed formerly you were wont to give us some freely, and will you not now let us have any for our money?",
  "40773": "How did it come about, I wonder, that the elder officers are not here to interfere with anything you do?",
  "40774": "Natasha, what is it about?",
  "40775": "I may turn my back on this town a few hours sooner than I intended, but what of that?",
  "40776": "How are they?",
  "40777": "Divide it by three, and what is the result?",
  "40778": "Would I speak to you if he did?",
  "40779": "Where shall I go to find you?",
  "40780": "And the casks?",
  "40781": "Said I, is there here a new world?",
  "40782": "Hamlet's which?",
  "40783": "And suppose some learned traveller should come across these specimens, eh?",
  "40784": "Dare you pretend to rouse him against me?",
  "40785": "Is it possible that you consider the sea to be greater now than formerly?",
  "40786": "Where are your reindeer?",
  "40787": "Why was it I wanted to tell him and did not tell him?",
  "40788": "Have I not a wife?",
  "40789": "What time are you supposed to return?",
  "40790": "Why, what are these doing, who are bent down so much?",
  "40791": "Five pounds?",
  "40792": "But why do you wish to bind yourself?",
  "40793": "Say, is it possible?",
  "40794": "You've bought our inn?",
  "40795": "If he were not only to sink from his highest resolve, but to sink into the hideous fettering of domestic hate?",
  "40796": "Must one not surrender his right when he is unable to recover it?",
  "40797": "Why are you so careful, so tender, of this one wrong and no other?",
  "40798": "How am I to pay them?",
  "40799": "You hear that?",
  "40800": "I hope you will not object to my remaining at home, sir?",
  "40801": "And you have brought him back here?",
  "40802": "Should he speak to her?",
  "40803": "And the first?",
  "40804": "How can one describe a man?",
  "40805": "Do you know what you look like, all together, as you are armed and guarded by your lackeys?",
  "40806": "Besides, if women are educated for dependence, that is, to act according to the will of another fallible being, and submit, right or wrong, to power, where are we to stop?",
  "40807": "Now, what are you waiting for?",
  "40808": "Have you got the pipe?",
  "40809": "Is it surprising, that such a tasteless being should rather caress this dog than her children?",
  "40810": "Of how many does it consist?",
  "40811": "How could they learn, how calculate, in the midst of this night?",
  "40812": "What satisfaction could a woman of delicacy promise herself in a union with such a man, when the very artlessness of her affection might appear insipid?",
  "40813": "Are not the two sexes made for one another?",
  "40814": "Are these bears here?",
  "40815": "No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of mine?",
  "40816": "When will he come?",
  "40817": "Were they TO BE or BORN TO BE?",
  "40818": "When you get through working your horses this fall, will you turn them out in the snow?",
  "40819": "If it's all wrong, why does he read them?",
  "40820": "This famous invention of yours?",
  "40821": "But what are you shouting for?",
  "40822": "Or what is your name?",
  "40823": "Do you mind him only having two noises?",
  "40824": "Was that poetry?",
  "40825": "Have we done?",
  "40826": "Why take less critical utilitarians as the only exponents of the school?",
  "40827": "And where do you find them?",
  "40828": "Should he, on the very threshold of such an errand, be afraid?",
  "40829": "Are you married, or are you not?",
  "40830": "The lamps are right, are they?",
  "40831": "For what purpose is your question?",
  "40832": "No luck for old fellows, then, my sweet bud of the wilderness?",
  "40833": "Did the other boys do so?",
  "40834": "Is it possible to transmit a projectile up to the moon?",
  "40835": "Would you like my carbine?",
  "40836": "So you do remember some things?",
  "40837": "Off I go where?",
  "40838": "And would not my four months' silence appear to him a tacit acceptance of our situation?",
  "40839": "Pray is your lodger within?",
  "40840": "What is easier, you know?",
  "40841": "What, you must leave?",
  "40842": "But how can I?",
  "40843": "What is it you want, dear grandpapa?",
  "40844": "Shall the air never again be lighted with the glare of our guns?",
  "40845": "Had this sphinx his fore paws in crime and his hind paws in authority?",
  "40846": "Was he sure of his man?",
  "40847": "You have already sworn the oath of secrecy and fidelity, and you are aware that the punishment for any breach of it is instant and inevitable death?",
  "40848": "Now what is this?",
  "40849": "Your excellency, how come you to be here?",
  "40850": "Well, then, a horse?",
  "40851": "As valiant as was that other?",
  "40852": "Alas, but that sentence is a puddle, is it not?",
  "40853": "I really, my dear, described to you a manner?",
  "40854": "You pelief, ten, in te possibilty of te odd ?",
  "40855": "Why is man, who was born for society, not yet associated?",
  "40856": "Yet in what respect can she be termed good?",
  "40857": "If it makes you invis'ble, why do you eat it?",
  "40858": "When do you wish me to go and find your father?",
  "40859": "And what news hear you?",
  "40860": "Might I see you sew it up?",
  "40861": "Is he a deputy?",
  "40862": "But how?",
  "40863": "Is it very late, mother?",
  "40864": "How are ye, lads?",
  "40865": "What next, I mean?",
  "40866": "And now, what must we do?",
  "40867": "Will this closet suit you, my brother?",
  "40868": "How could I answer?",
  "40869": "What of that?",
  "40870": "Is there any particular and special reason for your being unable to do either?",
  "40871": "Why will not the marechal advance me a portion of my patrimony?",
  "40872": "What were you crying for?",
  "40873": "Will you mount?",
  "40874": "Did you never observe, I said, the effect on the mind itself of exclusive devotion to gymnastic, or the opposite effect of an exclusive devotion to music?",
  "40875": "Still attracts a little, eh?",
  "40876": "Did his spirit sink as he approached his dreary home, oppressed with a dark foreboding of what the future should bring forth?",
  "40877": "So you DID get here, after all?",
  "40878": "Early?",
  "40879": "What is it that really happens?",
  "40880": "Equally?",
  "40881": "And now, how can I retrace the impression left upon me by that walk under the waters?",
  "40882": "How can she know how much we think of our darling?",
  "40883": "A being?",
  "40884": "Will you not come and choose your own beasts tomorrow?",
  "40885": "What can I say on the matter?",
  "40886": "And how was she to divide the guests between the marquee and the parlour?",
  "40887": "Did you get my note?",
  "40888": "Well, then, what can be done?",
  "40889": "Sell them?",
  "40890": "Well, is the plaid dry?",
  "40891": "What wonder was it that this spot exercised a strong attraction upon each of us at the moment when we were to turn our backs upon it for good?",
  "40892": "Are all voters true to their high responsibilities?",
  "40893": "What can that matter to him?",
  "40894": "What do you think of her?",
  "40895": "Did she also see slowly, but surely, increasing traces of those long wrinkles on the forehead, those slender serpents that nothing can check?",
  "40896": "But how can I wear ornaments if you, who are the elder sister, will never wear them?",
  "40897": "But what matters that?",
  "40898": "What kind of country should we have to deal with?",
  "40899": "Had the word lost its power, or could the failing eye and weary sense no longer answer to the touch of that mighty inspiration?",
  "40900": "At their age?",
  "40901": "What would therefore be more open to him than to keep her in love with him?",
  "40902": "Not to your ladyship's knowledge, perhaps?",
  "40903": "I hope you are not angry with him?",
  "40904": "Why do you look at the thing, then?",
  "40905": "McNabbs?",
  "40906": "Do you wish me to lend you some?",
  "40907": "Can you use your sails?",
  "40908": "Towards what?",
  "40909": "But what shall you do with him?",
  "40910": "But can there be any difficulty in proving, that vice and virtue are not matters of fact, whose existence we can infer by reason?",
  "40911": "Since a puff of tobacco can cloud it, shall I follow the fitful fire?",
  "40912": "When was that first hateful moment in which she had been conscious of a feeling that clashed with her truth, affection, and gratitude, and had not shaken it from her with horror, as if it had been a loathsome thing?",
  "40913": "Is that right?",
  "40914": "And yet you will let me perish with hunger?",
  "40915": "Why cannot I speak out?",
  "40916": "And why YOU?",
  "40917": "Are they and we no longer the same men?",
  "40918": "You feel quite at home here again, I dare say?",
  "40919": "Has any thing happened?",
  "40920": "When went he?",
  "40921": "Gone already?",
  "40922": "Does she not share in the general jubilee?",
  "40923": "Which way?",
  "40924": "And did you give it to him?",
  "40925": "What became of the poor woman?",
  "40926": "How could you send me such reports as these?",
  "40927": "Oh, ciphers is it?",
  "40928": "Had always the headache?",
  "40929": "Can any of them read?",
  "40930": "Have I the pleasure of seeing that gentleman before me?",
  "40931": "When?",
  "40932": "Why do you want water?",
  "40933": "Is she married?",
  "40934": "Is there any such foolish thing in the world, ha?",
  "40935": "Did any one of the thirteen colonies entertain such a design or expectation?",
  "40936": "Why, what has happened?",
  "40937": "What soul his future conduct can foresee?",
  "40938": "What praise shall we bestow?",
  "40939": "Well, sir, and what profession are you meant for?",
  "40940": "What man is that?",
  "40941": "You cannot seriously wish me to stay idling at home all day?",
  "40942": "Could you have believed such a thing possible?",
  "40943": "Do they take good care of you?",
  "40944": "What about it?",
  "40945": "Then he is here?",
  "40946": "And what do you say to all this?",
  "40947": "Where were you last night?",
  "40948": "Are all the rest of our men gone?",
  "40949": "What disturbs you?",
  "40950": "Have you given her warning for good?",
  "40951": "Truths?",
  "40952": "And did you not bring me to this cave?",
  "40953": "If you, who are the valet, hope for dispensation to commit a crime, shall not I, the friend of your bishop, have dispensation for eating meat at the call of my stomach?",
  "40954": "And what is the revolution that we shall cause?",
  "40955": "What the devil have you seen, then?",
  "40956": "Do you travel far?",
  "40957": "Why should you, for a mere passing pleasure, risk the loss of those great powers with which you have been endowed?",
  "40958": "And where are you off to now?",
  "40959": "And what is a portrait of a woman?",
  "40960": "Do you think that excuses his assaulting his passengers?",
  "40961": "How could she have while living such a rough life as this?",
  "40962": "Could I stand against the two?",
  "40963": "To hear you converse, to witness your resignation, one might almost believe that you liked your imprisonment?",
  "40964": "Would he find any demand on the part of his audience for a long series of statements, which to a modern seem to interrupt the story?",
  "40965": "Messala escaped?",
  "40966": "Is that clear?",
  "40967": "There, you hear that?",
  "40968": "I told you I was going out of town?",
  "40969": "Is there anything more you want?",
  "40970": "To have it reported on all sides and wherever you wished to stand well that you were a man of wit?",
  "40971": "Can it be that they will take me too?",
  "40972": "May we examine some of these articles?",
  "40973": "Who'll drive it across?",
  "40974": "What wine?",
  "40975": "When?",
  "40976": "Just so what is morality but high intelligence?",
  "40977": "Has he not given you rhymes and verses and tricks?",
  "40978": "Who the plague is hurt with all this nonsense?",

  "42165": "Where in the name of all that is wonderful did you get those names?",
  "42166": "At what place on the river are the people?",
  "42167": "Is not that somewhat premature?",
  "42168": "Is he muttering in his sleep?",
  "42169": "Now, I wonder who it can be about?",

  "42176": "Admitting this to be true of desire generally, let us suppose a particular class of desires, and out of these we will select hunger and thirst, as they are termed, which are the most obvious of them?",
  "42177": "May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?",
  "42178": "What baby?",

  "42220": "Have you nearly done?",
  "42221": "What did most of the people do?",
  "42222": "Surely you are mistaken?",
  "42223": "By exalting himself, or endeavoring to abase me?",

  "42240": "Now, what are these feline creatures?",
  "42241": "Of course it's just waste of money keeping me on at school, but what does he care?",
  "42242": "How do you do, sir?",
  "42243": "What a GIGANTIC strength of will, eh?",
  "42244": "And against whom?",
  "42245": "And have you any children?",
  "42246": "And I see you think he's a horrid man?",
  "42247": "Will I take the peas with me?",
  "42248": "Counsels upon what, sire?",
  "42249": "Where is your proof?",

  "42252": "Whose fault is it?",
  "42253": "But what was that mangled shape lying over there among the sandbags?",
  "42254": "And you are, then, perfectly sure of our victory?",
  "42255": "Did my father that?",
  "42256": "How could the thing be possible?",
  "42257": "What is his name?",
  "42258": "Was it possible that perhaps he might find him changed a little for the better and that he might overcome his shrinking from him?",

  "42270": "Were you an accomplice of that abandoned wretch, I wonder, of whose vile arts he became a victim, and of whom you used to be such an admirer?",
  "42271": "On earth, has he not pray'd?",
  "42272": "Did he still believe, now that the door of this prison was closed upon him, that he would succeed?",
  "42273": "What shall we think of the motives which could induce men of sense to reason in this manner?",

  "42912": "Do you see yonder, close by our ship, two barks, three sloops, five ships, eight pinks, four yawls, and six frigates making towards us, sent by the good people of the neighbouring island to our relief?",
  "42913": "Well, is she cheerful?",
  "42914": "What was his view about the value of silence?",
  "42915": "Do you think man is like a beast, that dies and is ended?",
  "42916": "How he shaped?",
  "42917": "What will be the use of the monarch whom the accidents of inheritance, such as we know them to be, must upon an average bring us just then?",
  "42918": "What will we buy?",
  "42919": "How can she look her friends in the face tomorrow?",
  "42920": "Why have I not had reason to shed them more frequently?",
  "42921": "What, not one bit for me?",
  "42922": "Quel nom a cetter jeune demoiselle en les pantoulles jolis?",
  "42923": "Will you send her on before and walk towards your house with me?",
  "42924": "That I, who have stood in the streets, and taken my people to my heart, and talked of the holiest and greatest things with them, could ever turn back and chatter foolishly to fashionable people about nothing in a drawingroom?",
  "42925": "Ought we not, then, to adopt every measure which may be necessary to perpetuate them?",
  "42926": "Now, then, tell me, if you please, what possible result of good would follow the issuing of such a proclamation as you desire?",
  "42927": "Indeed, how could they?",
  "42928": "And the note?",
  "42929": "In that case, supposing under the influence of liquor you left your purse behind when you leave here and I picked it up, why do you imagine that I should return it to you?",
  "42930": "Do you not sorrow for your daughter's death?",
  "42931": "Belstairs?",
  "42932": "Why should they be?",
  "42933": "How can it be even called life, when it produces so many deaths and plagues?",
  "42934": "Was he to go into society?",
  "42935": "What is his name?",
  "42936": "Had he ever been a spy himself?",
  "42937": "And who built such a wall?",
  "42938": "Is't not good?",
  "42939": "And how about you?",
  "42940": "You want to prepossess him in your favour?",
  "42941": "Have you been guiltless of perjury in respect of your vows and your love?",
  "42942": "But if the boat's there, where on earth's SHE?",
  "42943": "May I ask when you came?",
  "42944": "Anne, WHERE will this end?",
  "42945": "That's what you mean, I suppose?",
  "42946": "How could I forget when I had given my word?",
  "42947": "Are you surprised at this want of springs?",
  "42948": "In what cases?",
  "42949": "As for me, have I not, I ask you, made sufficient advances to him?",
  "42950": "What do you mean by saying not for us?",
  "42951": "How can you expect that he'll love his father?",
  "42952": "Then you profess ignorance of the crime with which you are charged?",
  "42953": "Think you the honours of the dead would still abide, if the souls of the departed were altogether powerless?",
  "42954": "Do you mean grave for me?",
  "42955": "But would it act in time?",
  "42956": "What's the sail got to do with you?",
  "42957": "What are you dreaming of?",
  "42958": "What's your honour's wull?",
  "42959": "Mamma, is it true?",
  "42960": "Are your feet any better than mine?",
  "42961": "By the way, would you like some supper?",
  "42962": "Oh, my eyes and limbs, what do you want?",
  "42963": "Well, my dear, how am I to know?",
  "42964": "Shall we pity him?",
  "42965": "What is the use of following the alleys?",
  "42966": "Which would get the upper hand, he or the secret?",
  "42967": "Well, then, when do you think of going?",
  "42968": "On what ground can religion or morality rest, when justice is thus set at defiance?",
  "42969": "But why, mother?",
  "42970": "May I come again?",
  "42971": "But what can be done against illuminism?",
  "42972": "What has come of all this?",
  "42973": "Of that you're sure?",
  "42974": "And now, what do you want?",
  "42975": "Draw lots, do you?",
  "42976": "My pythons and hamadryads?",
  "42977": "Had your breakfast?",
  "42978": "And how am I to keep his love?",
  "42979": "WHAT IS PROPERTY?",
  "42980": "What do you deserve to have done to you?",
  "42981": "What, what is it you want to make me feel, eh?",
  "42982": "Watson, this knife is surely in your line?",
  "42983": "Pedlar, I suppose you mean?",
  "42984": "Had he feigned a regard for her which he did not feel?",
  "42985": "Ah, is it you, cousin?",
  "42986": "King and friend, wherefore are you not here?",
  "42987": "Must I leave you, then?",
  "42988": "Has it not got down as thin as the homeopathic soup that was made by boiling the shadow of a pigeon that had starved to death?",
  "42989": "How on earth did you do that?",
  "42990": "What's that youse say?",
  "42991": "This?",
  "42992": "Were they, then, so necessary?",
  "42993": "Have you left me any honour?",
  "42994": "Did you ever see so many crocodiles?",
  "42995": "Are we in a healthful political state?",
  "42996": "Have you written much?",
  "42997": "Who am I who now address you?",
  "42998": "Can you take me?",
  "42999": "HIM?",
  "43000": "Are not arrangements already made for their convenience?",
  "43001": "And what is the origin of this name?",
  "43002": "Venn?",
  "43003": "Have you ever been in love with disease and suffering, like our nurses and philanthropists?",
  "43004": "She asked you to sup with her?",
  "43005": "And is it not a palpable, unquestionable good if a peasant, or a woman with a baby, has no rest day or night and I give them rest and leisure?",
  "43006": "But how do you know he'll be there when we return?",
  "43007": "In short, was the soul returning to the body?",
  "43008": "What were the fortunes of that oldest of all old kernels?",
  "43009": "Do with you?",
  "43010": "Yes, what?",
  "43011": "Have I not heard her footstep on the stair ?",
  "43012": "Have you any sense at all?",
  "43013": "Will it not be pleasant to do so again?",
  "43014": "Do you understand it?",
  "43015": "An accident, I presume?",
  "43016": "Lord, who can say, monsieur?",
  "43017": "To vile reproach what answer can we make?",
  "43018": "What are they going to bring us?",
  "43019": "Will you play again?",
  "43020": "How should he be strong, living as he has done?",
  "43021": "Well, what ails you?",
  "43022": "Or who standing by a large fire, feeleth not from thence a little of its heat?",
  "43023": "WHO'S going to do that?",
  "43024": "You told her I was here?",
  "43025": "Muishkin?",
  "43026": "And about to become the husband of a young and lovely girl?",
  "43027": "You go out at the gate by which you brought me in?",
  "43028": "Was there any feature of interest?",
  "43029": "A scientific interest, I suppose?",
  "43030": "You are not sure that he is dead, then?",
  "43031": "You will conduct us yourself, then, to that door?",
  "43032": "Come on, will you?",
  "43033": "When did he say this?",
  "43034": "How vain, if of these parents I was born?",
  "43035": "Before the angel's door?",
  "43036": "Why should we defer it?",
  "43037": "You ARE going to be married, are you not?",
  "43038": "Will you enlist?",
  "43039": "Are you speaking the truth about him now?",
  "43040": "Our tremulous lives are so different from theirs, are they not?",
  "43041": "What reason have you to be merry?",
  "43042": "Save you from what?",
  "43043": "Who arranged everything for you?",
  "43044": "And shall I let myself be bled as if I were a chamois among these innocent mountains?",
  "43045": "What are you really seeking?",
  "43046": "What is it, dear?",
  "43047": "Will she forever summon in vain to her assistance the lance of light of the ideal?",
  "43048": "When did it strike you?",
  "43049": "Where are our bundles?",
  "43050": "And when would his name have been mentioned, but with the makers of potable gold and malleable glass?",
  "43051": "Had he played faro?",
  "43052": "Perhaps she might be here still, who knows?",
  "43053": "What if my dear husband's death might still be avenged?",
  "43054": "Any flour or grain?",
  "43055": "Who are you, in the first place, to ask me to take a turn with you?",
  "43056": "Does this man know your majesty personally?",
  "43057": "How was she dressed?",
  "43058": "Barker?",
  "43059": "And, as involved in, and underlying all these questions, how ought they to be educated?",
  "43060": "Does the male parade his charms with so much pomp and rivalry for no purpose?",
  "43061": "Is not the famine already come against us?",
  "43062": "And so it's she that you think so wonderful?",
  "43063": "Are you, then, so easily turned from your design?",
  "43064": "Tell me, can I hope?",
  "43065": "Mother, how could you ever put such stuff into their heads?",
  "43066": "Are the fruits gray like dust or bright like blood?",
  "43067": "Oh, you mean the thing?",
  "43068": "What is there impossible in what I propose?",
  "43069": "But suppose you have made some error?",
  "43070": "Got it with you?",
  "43071": "Will you take some?",
  "43072": "By whom will Z be paid?",
  "43073": "Was it pleasant?",
  "43074": "Would he not at least have gone down to his death fighting heroically to the last?",
  "43075": "Shall I tell madame that monsieur will be here shortly?",
  "43076": "Had she been faithless to the earth?",
  "43077": "Did you take it?",
  "43078": "Who brought her father to life?",
  "43079": "This, then, is the friendly service which you swore to me?",
  "43080": "I wonder what her fate will be?",
  "43081": "What doth this gold profit us?",
  "43082": "What an innocent mutton, hey?",
  "43083": "Had she not accused the queen of having meetings by night with the earl in the deserted tower?",
  "43084": "What about the money?",
  "43085": "Is there, has there ever been, any question that by the law of war, property, both of enemies and friends, may be taken when needed?",
  "43086": "Kennedy?",
  "43087": "Despotic, passionate, ready for any violence as he was, what was he meditating, what had he made up his mind to do?",
  "43088": "Does he still write on his back?",
  "43089": "You must agree with me?",
  "43090": "Why have you not told me what to do?",
  "43091": "How shews it by night?",
  "43092": "Would he do her any hurt?",
  "43093": "Should not he be scalded first?",
  "43094": "Would you say that knowledge is a faculty, or in what class would you place it?",
  "43095": "What in the world are you doing here?",
  "43096": "Is that which may be so applied given to help the poor, who cannot pay for education, or does it virtually subsidise the comparatively rich, who can?",
  "43097": "Do you want me to be your best man?",
  "43098": "But know you who he was?",
  "43099": "Shall we go home, my father?",
  "43100": "Well, what does that mean?",
  "43101": "And what did you do with the child?",
  "43102": "Create national workshops, assure a minimum to unemployed workmen, and assign to employees a share of the profits?",
  "43103": "By the king?",
  "43104": "Did you venture so far?",
  "43105": "By looking like fools?",
  "43106": "What is the score?",
  "43107": "In the place of your laws of monopoly, the limits of whose circle your imagination is powerless to overstep?",
  "43108": "What is this rule, this measure, this criterion of progress, the violation of which is the perpetual cause of poverty?",
  "43109": "The whole nine?",
  "43110": "Why, what in the nation do you mean?",
  "43111": "Shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?",
  "43112": "Before a siege?",
  "43113": "What then can we look for from this confusion of groundless and extraordinary opinions but error and falshood?",
  "43114": "What, dollars?",
  "43115": "What did she care?",
  "43116": "How could he?",
  "43117": "Who is it that I hear?",
  "43118": "What are you afraid of?",
  "43119": "Where, when, and how was it built?",
  "43120": "Why are you shuddering?",
  "43121": "And what is the next question?",
  "43122": "Wherefore so?",
  "43123": "Suppose the man says to me seven and sixpence?",
  "43124": "What made you deceive me so?",
  "43125": "Express the object or purpose of so doing?",
  "43126": "Nay, what was the thing in which we knead our flour?",
  "43127": "Would you be so good?",
  "43128": "Where are the others?",
  "43129": "Have you any meat?",
  "43130": "Shall we keep on long in this way?",
  "43131": "Was he going to throw her down?",
  "43132": "How's a poor man to live that way?",
  "43133": "Did she place it on her head?",
  "43134": "This is clear enough, I suppose?",
  "43135": "What is that you have in your hand?",
  "43136": "Is it necessary, that the peasants should work to the very limits of their strength and never have sufficient to eat while we are living in the greatest luxury?",
  "43137": "And your companions?",
  "43138": "I am to be a soldier then?",
  "43139": "Well, why not?",
  "43140": "Do you believe he will come?",
  "43141": "And his body?",
  "43142": "How old do you think she is?",
  "43143": "But what are we to do with it?",
  "43144": "Natasha, you love me?",
  "43145": "Who recommended you to come here?",
  "43146": "Strange, is it not, that the thunder birds flap so heavily along the west at that moment and a peal of laughter sounds from the lake?",
  "43147": "Is it a secret, sir?",
  "43148": "Well, what do you want us to do?",
  "43149": "Bounds, my dear?",
  "43150": "What the hell is it to you who are my friends?",
  "43151": "What you said, is it?",
  "43152": "He wants words?",
  "43153": "There has been some new development?",
  "43154": "And now amid these things what shall I say?",
  "43155": "Can you tell what we may have to go through yet?",
  "43156": "How, then, am I going to stop him?",
  "43157": "How lost you your name, my most kind virgin?",
  "43158": "Who is to lead, and who to follow?",
  "43159": "Has that infernal dog torn up those geraniums again?",
  "43160": "And our guardian is both warrior and philosopher?",
  "43161": "Well, did you grieve very much for her?",
  "43162": "Are you kidding?",
  "43163": "And what did you do meantime?",
  "43164": "What's that on the arm of the chair, a fur cloak or some beast?",
  "43165": "Now, what can you do?",
  "43166": "You will go down slow, sir, I suppose?",
  "43167": "Whuzzat you say?",
  "43168": "Will you come again and help me to do it?",
  "43169": "What is the debt?",
  "43170": "And shall I nail down the lid, sir?",
  "43171": "Do you wish for a notary?",
  "43172": "What was it she bore in her arms, the little bundle that she held tight to her breast to shield it from the falling snow?",
  "43173": "What is the use of trying any more?",
  "43174": "Have you found them?",
  "43175": "Ca vous amuse, la vie?",
  "43176": "Would you kindly wait?",
  "43177": "How did the burglar know no one would hear it?",
  "43178": "Can you desire that I should ever find reason to regret the favorable opinion of the senate?",
  "43179": "Do you use whistles in your country?",
  "43180": "What, and scaped?",
  "43181": "Of what family is he, and where is his estate?",
  "43182": "You with a pleasant home?",
  "43183": "All alone?",
  "43184": "And have they keys of the grating?",
  "43185": "If I do, will you grant me common sense, then, for the future?",
  "43186": "Why, once you are rid of them, should you pester criminals to respect an uncongenial standard of conduct?",
  "43187": "And what is it we are watching for?",
  "43188": "Cannibals?",
  "43189": "On what then are you to live?",
  "43190": "You are wounded?",
  "43191": "Perhaps he would not see her any more?",
  "43192": "Do you complain of that?",
  "43193": "Who has told them not to capture me these twenty times over?",
  "43194": "What is the cause of this exclusion?",
  "43195": "But how came you in the bag?",
  "43196": "Let us hide him away, and who is the wiser?",
  "43197": "How acts the judge?",
  "43198": "Have you any ideas?",
  "43199": "You heard?",
  "43200": "What's to be the wonder now?",
  "43201": "But was he himself convinced of the accuracy of this explanation?",
  "43202": "Did you lose some of your teeth, the reason your voice sounds so funny?",
  "43203": "Hang it, what's that?",
  "43204": "How like you them, signior?",
  "43205": "What has she been saying to you?",
  "43206": "Why should he take all this trouble?",
  "43207": "Can you manage that?",
  "43208": "What payment?",
  "43209": "Till what?",
  "43210": "Or, if obtained, what can it amount to, but new disgraces, contentions and quarrels?",
  "43211": "I, sir?",
  "43212": "Is not general incivility the very essence of love?",
  "43213": "You persist, then?",
  "43214": "What is this story?",
  "43215": "So we're as we were?",
  "43216": "Do you still see as much of him as ever?",
  "43217": "Forever?",
  "43218": "You are happy, my dear father?",
  "43219": "Can I spare the time to walk with you, sir?",
  "43220": "You know, I suppose, who I married?",
  "43221": "Must not people take their chances in this world?",
  "43222": "Where were you, then?",
  "43223": "Is there life in the moon?",
  "43224": "How is that?",
  "43225": "What's his game in the matter?",
  "43226": "And why should the entire nation be thrown into the perilous convulsions of a revolution more truly formidable than any yet attempted on earth?",
  "43227": "But what had it to do with the crime?",
  "43228": "Well, if you did?",
  "43229": "And you said nothing?",
  "43230": "Well, are you ready?",
  "43231": "Can you get near enough to throw shells into the city?",
  "43232": "How could they then prevent the pirates from landing?",
  "43233": "Shall we expect some transatlantic military giant to step the ocean and crush us at a blow?",
  "43234": "Was it possible for me to expect in a lady of such high rank, a constancy proof against my want of address to support it?",
  "43235": "How do you account for what my father saw and heard there?",
  "43236": "Do you come a long way from here?",
  "43237": "You have a message for me?",
  "43238": "Where, sire?",
  "43239": "What do you mean by wrong?",
  "43240": "Has he not thrice refused?",
  "43241": "O, whither shall I flee?",
  "43242": "But what did that amount to?",
  "43243": "Can you produce him?",
  "43244": "If I am here at six it will do, I suppose?",
  "43245": "What else do we need?",
  "43246": "But shall I put my foot on his neck, I, of all men, when he is falling a prey to the intrigues of a pack of women and clerks?",
  "43247": "That surprises you, does it?",
  "43248": "If there be no life similar to ours in animals, how could we sustain our life by subsisting on them?",
  "43249": "Could this be a desirable condition for a young country to be in?",
  "43250": "How, then, could the attractiveness of labor serve us as a principle and lever, when it is still our object and our end?",
  "43251": "Finished with your uncle?",
  "43252": "Do the pale faces love their children less in the morning than at night?",
  "43253": "Were his companions dead with him?",
  "43254": "Boots, clothes, bread?",
  "43255": "In all candor let me ask, was such a system for benefiting the few at the expense of the many ever before devised?",
  "43256": "Would they perceive peoples, herds of lunar animals, towns, lakes, seas?",
  "43257": "Ha?",
  "43258": "And for what do you take us, then?",
  "43259": "And the nose?",
  "43260": "And WHO is it that must come some day?",
  "43261": "I wonder what'll become of MY name when I go in?",
  "43262": "What happened to the roses?",
  "43263": "And you knew how to make that calculation?",

  "44096": "Is not this true?",
  "44097": "But what has happened?",
  "44098": "What at our hands demand ye?",

  "44122": "Do you mean that there is no such maker or creator, or that in one sense there might be a maker of all these things but in another not?",
  "44123": "Well, little girl, what is it?",
  "44124": "Do not you feel a certain vibration of the soil?",
  "44125": "What is that machine?",
  "44126": "Had he reached the point where he could no longer recognize the reef, could no longer divine the snare, no longer discern the crumbling brink of abysses?",

  "44133": "Now what does this mean?",
  "44134": "What does it matter to you now, in any case?",
  "44135": "Our father?",
  "44136": "Never mind, never mind, what does it matter?",
  "44137": "What o'clock was this?",
  "44138": "And would you just throw in a nod when I seem to ask you for it?",
  "44139": "What was he to say?",
  "44140": "And what is your success?",
  "44141": "That's a most puzzling expression for a natural science man, do you understand?",
  "44142": "Was he not made?",
  "44143": "Would an exchange of name be an exchange of rights?",
  "44144": "And have we, any on us, yet come so low as he come?",

  "44163": "Why did he not break it there, since it is evident that every yard that he carried it increased the risk of someone meeting him?",
  "44164": "Which I took hold of and was merrily asking him what he would take to have it said for my honour that it was of my getting?",

  "44203": "What would they do in that case?",
  "44204": "You have not counted me out as equal to so much land, and calculated on me as a balance at your banker's?",
  "44205": "Do you know what this plant is?",
  "44206": "Was he awake, or was it but a dream?",
  "44207": "I wonder where we can go next?",
  "44208": "Are you thinking, if I'm drunk itself, I'd leave my daughter living single with a little frisky rascal is the like of you?",
  "44209": "And what awaits you if you remain faithful to your oath, and obey the commands given you?",

  "44218": "Can we really affect the adversary's will?",
  "44219": "Shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the sea?",
  "44220": "Would you say that these, or any similar impertinences which private individuals are supposed to address to their rulers, whether in verse or prose, are well or ill spoken?",

  "44223": "D'you like all that frilly, bunchy stuff at the throat?",
  "44224": "What purpose do they serve?",
  "44225": "Oh is it?",
  "44226": "Were all those dear, sorrowful, valiant, charming or tragic beings merely dreams?",
  "44227": "Is there anything of the feminine gender among them?",

  "44873": "But how shall I address the minister?",
  "44874": "What's his name going to be?",
  "44875": "He defies the usurer, does he?",
  "44876": "What's true?",
  "44877": "Have I guessed truly?",
  "44878": "Devil take it, what did you do in there?",
  "44879": "But be their shortcomings ever so great and many, who would dispense with these works?",
  "44880": "These and many other questions arise in my mind, but what is the good of asking them now?",
  "44881": "Do you know what you have done?",
  "44882": "What key?",
  "44883": "Fine sentiments, you say?",
  "44884": "Who be ye?",
  "44885": "If you are so ready, young ladies, to chop and change, do you suppose that she is?",
  "44886": "Shall man its search endure?",
  "44887": "Who should I halt for?",
  "44888": "Do they know him?",
  "44889": "Did she return home?",
  "44890": "She's been talking, has she?",
  "44891": "You do?",
  "44892": "Or does she exert a choice, and prefer certain males?",
  "44893": "And you did not awaken me?",
  "44894": "What took place between these two beings?",
  "44895": "You supposed that I was alone?",
  "44896": "What do you wish to say about it?",
  "44897": "How can I now thrum the tunes, sith I have lost my hand?",
  "44898": "What has effected this revolution?",
  "44899": "Granton?",
  "44900": "Also they are utterly unjust, if we were right in our notion of justice?",
  "44901": "What's demoralized you?",
  "44902": "Aire?",
  "44903": "Waiter, who's been helping himself to my whiskey?",
  "44904": "And yet what is the feeling of lovers when they recognize a lyre, or a garment, or anything else which the beloved has been in the habit of using?",
  "44905": "As if one were frighted?",
  "44906": "Is there any one here who has stout loins and heart?",
  "44907": "Is it doubted, then, that the plan I propose, if adopted, would shorten the war, and thus lessen its expenditure of money and of blood?",
  "44908": "How dare you cast eyes on him when I had forbidden it?",
  "44909": "Would it not be expedient that he should take the lady at her word and escape?",
  "44910": "The poor lieutenant?",
  "44911": "What will mother and father live on now?",
  "44912": "Did you lose each other in the confusion?",
  "44913": "What do the circumstances of life matter if your dreams make you lord paramount of time and space?",
  "44914": "You'll take a morsel of something?",
  "44915": "What shall I talk about?",
  "44916": "Is it not right to resign ourselves entirely, whatever may be denied us?",
  "44917": "Because you've made up your mind?",
  "44918": "What does the warrior want with the scalps of women?",
  "44919": "Those that sweeten and those that embitter?",
  "44920": "Can you endure to think of the dismemberment of our country?",
  "44921": "Do you think I am to be imposed upon by that northern accent, which you have assumed?",
  "44922": "I suppose you've heard of me?",
  "44923": "You like my new suit?",
  "44924": "What, then, do you suppose?",
  "44925": "Julie?",
  "44926": "Now you understand me?",
  "44927": "Candy man, have you a sweetheart anywhere with hair as long and soft as that?",
  "44928": "How can she stay in the town where you are?",
  "44929": "Who's sending him back?",
  "44930": "Or, why are so many witnesses summoned, and so many artifices practised, to discover what so easy an experiment would infallibly reveal?",
  "44931": "Can I appoint you my executor?",
  "44932": "How about the horses?",
  "44933": "Do you really know any others who have it?",
  "44934": "How will you give me notice of it?",
  "44935": "And the goldsmith?",
  "44936": "Why, I hope you will not a hawking now, will you?",
  "44937": "How know you it?",
  "44938": "How had he come to such a pass?",
  "44939": "But why should not I wear pink ribbons?",
  "44940": "For who could have forborne?",
  "44941": "But what do you propose to do?",
  "44942": "How could you so cruel?",
  "44943": "That is to say, you would rather not?",
  "44944": "Could this have any connection with the crime?",
  "44945": "Why am I asked what next shall see the light?",
  "44946": "Why did he feel that it was not unwatchful?",
  "44947": "Where's that other beast?",
  "44948": "Now, where is the romance in all that?",
  "44949": "And the same wages as he had?",
  "44950": "No one will be less likely to commit adultery, or to dishonour his father and mother, or to fall in his religious duties?",
  "44951": "That you think it would be so charming?",
  "44952": "What means it?",
  "44953": "Does it belong to the smaller or to the larger of the two?",
  "44954": "Are we to have nothing tonight?",
  "44955": "Why, my brave horses, why be left behind?",
  "44956": "That their genius should not have in it, even after the lapse of ages, some little of heaven?",
  "44957": "Why, cannot you see that they are all infatuated with pride and vanity?",
  "44958": "Had she not guessed anything, seen anything, comprehended anything?",
  "44959": "Which is the best?",
  "44960": "Wherefore, then, should I be dissatisfied?",
  "44961": "How are my father and mother?",
  "44962": "How much had he written away?",
  "44963": "Will your excellency be so good as to mount the shoulders of two of our men, they will carry you ashore?",
  "44964": "You see that pile of pig iron?",
  "44965": "What could he wish or look for that he would not have obtained through my friendship?",
  "44966": "Here, take this,' continued he, after rapidly writing the few lines I brought to your excellency, and upon receipt of which you deigned to receive me into your service, and proudly I ask whether your excellency has ever had cause to repent having done so?",
  "44967": "Are you?",
  "44968": "Can you tell a good many fighting stories?",
  "44969": "What bride?",
  "44970": "Boythorn?",
  "44971": "Will that suit you?",
  "44972": "Where is the boat in which you came, gentlemen?",
  "44973": "What news?",
  "44974": "Is there any city which he might name?",
  "44975": "Will your majesty permit me to express a contrary opinion?",
  "44976": "What little gell's this?",
  "44977": "Who's the stranger?",
  "44978": "Did you hear us?",
  "44979": "Do the dead come back?",
  "44980": "Your wound?",
  "44981": "Why, did you know her, papa?",
  "44982": "Why was that corner chosen to write it on?",
  "44983": "How can one believe a woman after that?",
  "44984": "What do you think he wants to do?",
  "44985": "What ails us gazing where all seen is hollow?",
  "44986": "And when you want to buy a ship, the shipwright or the pilot would be better?",
  "44987": "How could it be possible for us to disobey your commands?",
  "44988": "But in what sense?",
  "44989": "About whom?",
  "44990": "Where, where are you going to?",
  "44991": "Why not you also?",
  "44992": "After her having been what she was?",
  "44993": "It was you, then, who wrote to him?",
  "44994": "How can I dare to form a scheme, when I am aware that the chance of success must be so strong against me?",
  "44995": "Have you gone cracked, my good friend?",
  "44996": "How else can we explain her frenzied anxiety that her second one should not enter it?",
  "44997": "If this be the design of it, who can so properly be the inquisitors for the nation as the representatives of the nation themselves?",
  "44998": "Why spoil those apples?",
  "44999": "If the charge be incapacity, what evidence will support it?",
  "45000": "Do you play then?",
  "45001": "Will he ever return?",
  "45002": "If you have to draw a man who is in motion, or lifting or pulling, or carrying a weight equal to his own, in what way must you set on his legs below his body?",
  "45003": "What is life, and what is death?",
  "45004": "What would happen then?",
  "45005": "Was this the banquet he prepar'd for us?",
  "45006": "What then gives us so great a propension to ascribe an identity to these successive perceptions, and to suppose ourselves possest of an invariable and uninterrupted existence through the whole course of our lives?",
  "45007": "If so, what became of them in those dreadful days?",
  "45008": "How can we here?",
  "45009": "Did he understand that he had made a grave mistake?",
  "45010": "Nor courage either?",
  "45011": "Now will you do what I want you to?",
  "45012": "No light repartee, have you, old bean?",
  "45013": "How did you word your inquiries?",
  "45014": "Can we not avoid them by keeping to the shore?",
  "45015": "Is it improper and unsafe to intermix the different powers of government in the same body of men?",
  "45016": "Do you promise to deliver it?",
  "45017": "How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil?",
  "45018": "Who are you?",
  "45019": "What is your name?",
  "45020": "Did you see him then?",
  "45021": "How could the fruits follow?",
  "45022": "His name?",
  "45023": "Why the devil have they any stairs with such windows?",
  "45024": "What made you open it?",
  "45025": "You have seen him at work?",
  "45026": "Where else can I ask him?",
  "45027": "But can we not descend?",
  "45028": "Pip, will you tell me something?",
  "45029": "What lunacy is this, that haunts this man?",
  "45030": "Say, how long are you going to stay here?",
  "45031": "How shall I make my music now?",
  "45032": "Can I never act for you, and you for me?",
  "45033": "Do you think it is true?",
  "45034": "How would you like that?",
  "45035": "That is your affair?",
  "45036": "What noise was that?",
  "45037": "What would you give that you could help loving me?",
  "45038": "Do we suppose that principle, whatever it may be in man, which has to do with justice and injustice, to be inferior to the body?",
  "45039": "Yes, what it is?",
  "45040": "Where had he seen those lineaments?",
  "45041": "Of what was I speaking?",
  "45042": "Never in moderation?",
  "45043": "Is the other one stuffed also?",
  "45044": "What best wishes?",
  "45045": "Why, who else could I possibly suspect?",
  "45046": "What made you leave me to come here alone?",
  "45047": "Something will turn up?",
  "45048": "Abandon this subject altogether, and again jeer at the monks and ridicule the nuns?",
  "45049": "Have these very matters ever produced any difficulty amongst us?",
  "45050": "Have I not also critics who do not spare me?",
  "45051": "What avails recrimination over matters wholly past recall?",
  "45052": "It die?",
  "45053": "But if he had escaped?",
  "45054": "Who was that insolent fellow?",
  "45055": "What new mystery was this?",
  "45056": "Is not this unavoidable?",
  "45057": "Could it be for any other reason than that he did not want to see it, and if so was he not a traitor to the cause of truth?",
  "45058": "Why are better results attained under scientific management than under the other types?",
  "45059": "Ah, a weapon?",
  "45060": "What was he, then?",
  "45061": "Matter?",
  "45062": "Run away?",
  "45063": "What does he say?",
  "45064": "Why is it that the peace of the country is disturbed in order that one people may assume to judge of what another people should do?",
  "45065": "So you think he'll make her an offer today?",
  "45066": "But where is he?",
  "45067": "It was the only letter you had?",
  "45068": "You have no explanation yourself of the tragedy?",
  "45069": "What do you mean by having made a stiff?",
  "45070": "What different armour should I need?",
  "45071": "Should he abandon her?",
  "45072": "Who is with him?",
  "45073": "Can you bear witness that you're no better than a fool?",
  "45074": "What should I do with a translation?",
  "45075": "You did not get my letter?",
  "45076": "By whom was she espied, and how entrapped?",
  "45077": "Is she a very massive person?",
  "45078": "And what is your opinion?",
  "45079": "According to scientific notions of inertia and force, what ought to be the result?",
  "45080": "And your address?",
  "45081": "What sort of husband can he be?",
  "45082": "How do they use to be?",
  "45083": "What are you doing there, you rascal?",
  "45084": "Convicts?",
  "45085": "Why, then, are you about to betray it to me?",
  "45086": "But even in that case, may he have no object beyond his present station, to which he may sacrifice his independence?",
  "45087": "And powder, and bullets?",
  "45088": "If your husband thinks fit to keep you in the dark over this matter, is it for me, who has only learned the true facts under the pledge of professional secrecy, to tell what he has withheld?",
  "45089": "Have you had one of your bad nights?",
  "45090": "What, my friends, must be the consequences of this agitation?",
  "45091": "Can I do anything for you, gentlemen?",
  "45092": "Could he still rise and regain his footing in his conscience upon something solid?",
  "45093": "Is it not indeed great enough, sire?",
  "45094": "Are you ambitious, and do you seek after the greatnesses of the earth?",
  "45095": "When they have no leaves and look gray and brown and dry, how can you tell whether they are dead or alive?",
  "45096": "Would we be able to see those pictures?",
  "45097": "And you never confined your patients?",
  "45098": "How could you be so obstinate?",
  "45099": "Tom, what on earth ails that cat?",
  "45100": "What is to be done with her, then?",
  "45101": "Do you know what it is?",
  "45102": "Which way went he, young man?",
  "45103": "Are you coming to this ball?",
  "45104": "Why did he not correct our judgment at the start?",
  "45105": "How can one deceive these dear little birds, when they look at one so sweetly and confidingly?",
  "45106": "What is the matter at home?",
  "45107": "Is there any sense in it?",
  "45108": "And where is he going?",
  "45109": "Well, what have I to do with that?",
  "45110": "Do you not consume supplies as fast as you get them forward?",
  "45111": "But, what am I saying?",
  "45112": "Shall we try argument?",
  "45113": "Verdurin?",
  "45114": "Then I asked if there were many clerks?",
  "45115": "How can he talk like that?",
  "45116": "But who gave you leave to cease eating mutton?",
  "45117": "And what can one do?",
  "45118": "Yes, that is the doctor we've been sewing for, is it?",
  "45119": "What pamphlet is this?",
  "45120": "Was it not for these causes that you send for me when the great trouble came?",
  "45121": "May I live with you, and tend upon you as I used to do?",
  "45122": "Do you see this same ram?",
  "45123": "Shall I go and offer her my services?",
  "45124": "And why does the minister keep his hand over his heart?",
  "45125": "Who keeps house here?",
  "45126": "Are they not bubbles?",
  "45127": "How is all with you?",
  "45128": "Tasting?",
  "45129": "What are his qualifications?",
  "45130": "Where did you start from?",
  "45131": "Could anything cause us to swerve to one side?",
  "45132": "And are not both the city and the entire temple now full of the dead bodies of your countrymen?",
  "45133": "You dine and sleep here, of course?",
  "45134": "What else could I look for, being what I am, and leading such a life as mine?",
  "45135": "Where is this poor giant, or this poor wretch of a vanquished knight, to find her?",
  "45136": "It is the first time, then, that you ever went to that house?",
  "45137": "How may we pass that which is impassable?",
  "45138": "In what stables champed these sleek, nervous horses and rested the gorgeous carriages?",
  "45139": "And what am I to tell your father?",
  "45140": "My father is well, is he not?",
  "45141": "Was it going farther from, or nearing, the disc?",
  "45142": "Recollect, my lord, if he did not say something a little like that to you?",
  "45143": "Is he really her cousin, as he says?",
  "45144": "Who's to prevent me?",
  "45145": "Why dig up the pestilence from the pit in which it is buried?",
  "45146": "I may go on?",
  "45147": "And by whom?",
  "45148": "It is true, then?",
  "45149": "Should an ass exceed me in fortitude?",
  "45150": "Would the island hold together till then?",
  "45151": "No, why should you?",
  "45152": "What can I do sir?",
  "45153": "Should I have remained in that house, near you and them, if I did not love them?",
  "45154": "And this letter?",
  "45155": "And if it be so, what is it?",
  "45156": "Mother, what are you crying for?",
  "45157": "Were I to allow you to march out, what security can I have that you will not join them, and afterwards fight against me?",
  "45158": "Reinforcements?",
  "45159": "What's up with you?",
  "45160": "Should it ever be said that he had robbed those old men, whom he so truly and so tenderly loved in his heart of hearts?",
  "45161": "What made you think he'd ceased to take any interest in the case?",
  "45162": "Is it anything I have done that has pulled you down like that?",
  "45163": "What could my father mean by sending me to be an inmate in this strange family?",
  "45164": "You mean you'll have no quarrel with me?",
  "45165": "Was he awake or was he asleep?",
  "45166": "Well, but if I bought the mill, and allowed your husband to act as my manager in the same way, how then?",
  "45167": "What am I to do if I love him and the other one too?",
  "45168": "And have you come from far like this?",
  "45169": "Could she, who had been so active in the getting up of the funeral triumph, do less than exult?",
  "45170": "Who now will tell the ladies that I would hie me thither?",
  "45171": "What is genius?",
  "45172": "You have taken care, I hope, of the casket I sent you to lock up?",
  "45173": "What evils?",
  "45174": "And is it wounded?",
  "45175": "What recollections of boyhood and innocence might have been flitting across his brain?",
  "45176": "What noise is that?",
  "45177": "No dignity in whaling?",
  "45178": "Why could they not wait a little?",
  "45179": "What are you thinking of?",
  "45180": "Why should we be unable to preserve a remembrance of them?",
  "45181": "There is something else you wanted to say?",
  "45182": "Was I not right in saying at the outset that, relatively to the tax, we are behind our institutions?",
  "45183": "What charge, sir?",
  "45184": "Did you see no one?",
  "45185": "Oh, may I get this rose?",
  "45186": "He asked me whether I would go with him?",
  "45187": "Why did you leave him on the road?",
  "45188": "And in such a case what is one to say?",
  "45189": "But as I am not bound to give in to your plans, any more than you are compelled to submit to mine, may I ask to know if you have formed any which depend on my assistance?",
  "45190": "Yes, why?",
  "45191": "To which of us?",
  "45192": "Could we not break it?",
  "45193": "What does he drink?",
  "45194": "Is this the part of wise men, engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty?",
  "45195": "Cannot you describe her?",
  "45196": "And that which is not more or less a harmony is not more or less harmonized?",
  "45197": "A joke?",
  "45198": "What is his folly?",
  "45199": "I must, then, remain here?",
  "45200": "Who were they?",
  "45201": "Mercenary, mem?",
  "45202": "Is that worth talking about and making so much ado?",
  "45203": "When are you starting?",
  "45204": "You want no treasures and no castles?",
  "45205": "Now then, gentlemen, shall I break the seal or not?",
  "45206": "It must have been on the boulevard?",
  "45207": "Could a statue of marble have been more impassive and more mute?",
  "45208": "Would you like to?",
  "45209": "Do you call yourself a raw country girl?",
  "45210": "And, then, do you think that my stumps are pretty?",
  "45211": "Sure it's he?",
  "45212": "Whose fault?",
  "45213": "What matter?",
  "45214": "And wherefore has he not been to see me?",
  "45215": "Shall we really try it?",
  "45216": "Doth any praise himself?",
  "45217": "I tried to decline taking the guinea on the first occasion, but with no better effect than causing her to ask me very angrily, if I expected more?",
  "45218": "What has age to do with it?",
  "45219": "What besides?",
  "45220": "Separate, my dear?",
  "45221": "And alone?",
  "45222": "Why should I pull her into it?",
  "45223": "No cheering news, then?",
  "45224": "And with what object?",
  "45225": "What do you keep SAYING you will for?",
  "45226": "But the earl?",
  "45227": "Do you see, now, one reason why I have let you go thus early into the world?",
  "45228": "Will you show me your plan?",
  "45229": "What needs appealing in a fact so plain?",
  "45230": "Bast?",
  "45231": "What was it you wanted to ask, sir?",
  "45232": "Did you ever hear such a name?",
  "45233": "Can it attack it beneath the waves?",
  "45234": "Are we to expect nothing but chivalric tenderness and compassion from men who made war on a tolerant government to make more secure their barbaric system of oppression?",
  "45235": "If we had to keep account of our amours, we should be just as embarrassed as this cytisus which you apostrophized would be in counting up his descendants, should we not?",
  "45236": "To those who love as ourselves, in what respect differs a year from an hour?",
  "45237": "And you think that just?",
  "45238": "You will start at once?",
  "45239": "To what point of the continent?",
  "45240": "Will you play?",
  "45241": "And what was the policy of that ally?",
  "45242": "But who should tell him so?",
  "45243": "Her voice when she talked to them?",
  "45244": "Would the militia, in this supposition, be more ready or more able to support the federal authority than in the case of a general union?",
  "45245": "Is he in favor of all these things at once?",
  "45246": "How are they represented, whose very sweat supports the splendid stud of an heir apparent, or varnishes the chariot of some female favourite who looks down on shame?",
  "45247": "Or show you restless, miswandering, misclimbing ones, new and easier footpaths?",
  "45248": "Do you think the thing possible?",
  "45249": "Is the door shut?",
  "45250": "But what will you do?",
  "45251": "Well, then, have you any better plan to propose?",
  "45252": "What, have you a wife, then?",
  "45253": "But does nothing depend on it for them?",

  "45646": "Open it with one of these here keys?",
  "45647": "Did you bury him then?",
  "45648": "And the inharmonious is cowardly and boorish?",
  "45649": "Who is it that's starving us?",
  "45650": "Could you let me have a meal ticket?",
  "45651": "You think there is someone behind him?",
  "45652": "What do you suppose my name is?",
  "45653": "Or that his nature, being such as we have delineated, is akin to the highest good?",
  "45654": "Does he dare to deny that?",
  "45655": "Had they formerly invaded it, so that certain unaccountable peculiarities might be explained in this way?",
  "45656": "Whom are you attacking?",
  "45657": "How, cannot be?",
  "45658": "But how will you do about dining with them?",
  "45659": "Do you not find it interesting?",
  "45660": "How can you expect me to see the show if you stand right in front of me?",
  "45661": "Has not your insatiable ambition brought us to this?",
  "45662": "I, the unkind, ungrateful?",
  "45663": "How may this be unless you first lay open to him the wound or trouble in your soul?",
  "45664": "Will you be kind enough to lend me a couple of shillings?",
  "45665": "Is my wife gone forth?",
  "45666": "Who shall decide when doctors disagree?",
  "45667": "And who that thinks with me will not fearlessly adopt the oath that I take?",
  "45668": "As ugly as that?",

  "45675": "But how will you kindle it?",
  "45676": "Is it meant for anybody in particular?",
  "45677": "What could he say to so trouble you?",
  "45678": "Worse off?",
  "45679": "The daffodils were pretty, but who could see them?",
  "45680": "What is it then?",
  "45681": "No, replied she, I will know first what reason you can give for not accepting my proposal, if you are innocent?",
  "45682": "And who then are you, whose name should create so deep a feeling of terror?",
  "45683": "I wonder if we shall see the robin?",
  "45684": "Is all that fever gone, and is he strong and hearty?",
  "45685": "What are you to say of a scientist like that?",
  "45686": "But how was this information to he obtained?",
  "45687": "Would such an arrangement be any satisfaction to you?",

  "45693": "Well, cousin, are you ready to go to meeting?",
  "45694": "And because we think right to destroy you, do you think that you have any right to destroy us in return, and your country as far as in you lies?",
  "45695": "How long will we be gone?",
  "45696": "Where could they commence a fresh quest?",
  "45697": "We must recollect that the individual in whom the several qualities of his nature do their own work will be just, and will do his own work?",
  "45698": "And your order?",
  "45699": "Then you do not require me to pay?",
  "45700": "Did the veteran make himself disastrously felt in the leader?",
  "45701": "Upon what should he decide?",
  "45702": "Why not do it?",
  "45703": "Are they what?",
  "45704": "Has not this dead man whom you have just helped to bury, taught you the vanity of human affairs?",
  "45705": "And why should he not have this?",
  "45706": "But was it the candy man?",
  "45707": "Did you go into these houses with her?",
  "45708": "What is a piece of money, in fact?",
  "45709": "What'll you take for him?",

  "45711": "Remove the eye of authority and where are you?",
  "45712": "And is such a girl to be my nephew's sister?",
  "45713": "What promise?",
  "45714": "Oh, what shall I do?",
  "45715": "The queen asked him if he had forgotten who it was he was speaking to?",
  "45716": "But what would have become of our story and all our friends, then?",
  "45717": "How can you call it a GOOD night when you know it must be the very worst night I've ever had?",
  "45718": "I've provided for men and shipmates times enough, but I'm as ignorant as a child how many glasses of grog a woman, that's not a drinking woman, is expected to consume at these ceremonies?",
  "45719": "Why was some one so anxious to get possession of it?",
  "45720": "Why, child?",
  "45721": "What do you feel?",
  "45722": "Was it you, then, I saw under the willow tree the other night?",
  "45723": "How could you be so cruel?",
  "45724": "And what do you do now, you pernicious villains?",
  "45725": "What will he do with the third?",
  "45726": "What did you ask her?",
  "45727": "You will be satisfied with it?",
  "45728": "Why destroy me?",
  "45729": "What is it, monseigneur?",
  "45730": "Good heavens, what are you telling me?",
  "45731": "Find him?",
  "45732": "Is that you, miserable wretch?",
  "45733": "What were we talking about?",
  "45734": "Come, what do they say about the new act I have got passed in the council?",
  "45735": "Where were you last night?",
  "45736": "Is that what you affirm?",
  "45737": "But what could she say or do?",
  "45738": "I hope you want nothing?",
  "45739": "And joy, the joy of the theatre, would that, too, be taken away?",
  "45740": "Why not tonight?",
  "45741": "And is there naught to show that man dwells there?",
  "45742": "Was it to everyone?",
  "45743": "Shall I tell you my guess?",
  "45744": "How do you prepare it for eating?",
  "45745": "And is not this daughter dead?",
  "45746": "Come, what's the matter, old fellow?",
  "45747": "Sblood, let them keep themselves, they are no sheep, are they?",
  "45748": "Do you see that you have given offence?",
  "45749": "Why did you leave them?",
  "45750": "What do you allude to?",
  "45751": "But what is it?",
  "45752": "But what would induce them to rise in insurrection, when they are so happy and contented as you have described?",
  "45753": "Will you buy it, my dear?",
  "45754": "What more do you want?",
  "45755": "But why?",
  "45756": "If monarchy is a useless thing, why is it kept up anywhere?",
  "45757": "Five?",
  "45758": "Get my note?",
  "45759": "Who could want me?",
  "45760": "I wish to know whether you desire this arrangement or whether you do not?",
  "45761": "Is it the story he would not understand, or the storyteller?",
  "45762": "Would not one of these have served?",
  "45763": "Are you thinking them's his boots?",
  "45764": "For the purpose of making investigations there?",
  "45765": "I ask you where are you going, you villain?",
  "45766": "And if it is still empty?",
  "45767": "Or in case we prefer neither of them, but successively assent to both, as is usual among philosophers, with what confidence can we afterwards usurp that glorious title, when we thus knowingly embrace a manifest contradiction?",
  "45768": "But are you under the impression that you have so great a mind that you can understand the most profound writer at a first reading?",
  "45769": "Do you like sitting alone?",
  "45770": "Such a revelation, do you say?",
  "45771": "Then why are they sent out?",
  "45772": "But after all, what is it?",
  "45773": "What is the matter with him today?",
  "45774": "Of course, you will stop and take your midday meal with me?",
  "45775": "Why are the bass strings loaded with coils of wire?",
  "45776": "Kryltzoff, it's true that the doctor has prescribed cough mixture for me, is it not?",
  "45777": "If everything's so all right what is there to make up for?",
  "45778": "Cake?",
  "45779": "Was there no one else to pay for you?",
  "45780": "Come, what is your competence?",
  "45781": "And that those who are never improper should so often be dull and heavy?",
  "45782": "Will you speak for me?",
  "45783": "Had not you better sell them?",
  "45784": "How do things go aboard?",
  "45785": "You understand me?",
  "45786": "Your presentiments?",
  "45787": "Where are your papers?",
  "45788": "Whose fault is that?",
  "45789": "Why, what did you call it yesterday, then, leaving your sister's house in a tantrum?",
  "45790": "Is reason, then, synonymous with intelligence?",
  "45791": "What is there to say to such a question?",
  "45792": "What should be our attitude toward separate schools?",
  "45793": "Or is it to be decided by your own laws, by your own rules of judicature?",
  "45794": "Do you see that brooch?",
  "45795": "You were there the next morning about noon?",
  "45796": "Why did you not tell me that you contemplated ambushing those fellows?",
  "45797": "The littlest key?",
  "45798": "Why should he turn like this?",
  "45799": "Now, what call have you to say that?",
  "45800": "You do, do you?",
  "45801": "If it is useless, are they poorer?",
  "45802": "Why must you?",
  "45803": "But have you tried?",
  "45804": "What more did he ask you?",
  "45805": "Does not this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practical resolution in facing death?",
  "45806": "Shall I serve them up?",
  "45807": "What hotel is he stopping at?",
  "45808": "You know that your aunt believes you will go back?",
  "45809": "Can any one doubt as to the reason of it?",
  "45810": "But you will not mind for one evening, dear?",
  "45811": "But what could a ball do against the scaly armour with which these enormous beasts were clad?",
  "45812": "Saturday?",
  "45813": "Why may not I take sword and indulge the passion of war?",

  "45819": "Is it from mere humanity you bid me live?",
  "45820": "You can bear a little more?",
  "45821": "The next question was, who should reign?",
  "45822": "What is there on the reverse side of the picture?",
  "45823": "What can bring her here so often?",
  "45824": "How dare you insult me thus?",
  "45825": "Who was it got them to give him a lift?",
  "45826": "What proof had he of this?",
  "45827": "Escaped?",
  "45828": "Where?",

  "45832": "Where'll I hide my poor body from that ghost of hell?",
  "45833": "But are the beasts as wise as the men?",
  "45834": "Have you forgotten?",
  "45835": "Do you not think, earl, that this will be an amusing spectacle, and one refreshing to the heart, to see how the tiger and dove struggle with each other?",
  "45836": "How am I?",
  "45837": "What is the good of making him inhale ammonia and all that parcel of drugs?",
  "45838": "Why should you not be there?",
  "45839": "How on earth am I to tell her that I am a respectable, engaged member of society and it's all over between us?",
  "45840": "And you have it still?",
  "45841": "And how do you know it?",
  "45842": "Shall I be baffled thus?",
  "45843": "Should she unclasp it, should she not?",

  "45849": "Do you call that LESS?",
  "45850": "Can it be he?",
  "45851": "Why do I tell myself lies?",
  "45852": "But does he therefore confer no benefit when he works for nothing?",
  "45853": "Had he not saved her, and was he not entitled to this honour?",
  "45854": "Is it in property?",
  "45855": "But how was I to write?",
  "45856": "Are you glad, papa?",
  "45857": "Suppose her majesty refuses?",
  "45858": "Oh, you be, be you?",
  "45859": "Tell me, do you think the number of your company is greater than mine?",

  "45861": "Would you like to give me a kiss for a poem?",
  "45862": "Will you not bring me a little water?",
  "45863": "What are you all thinking about?",
  "45864": "How could a woman be a tower of ivory or a house of gold?",
  "45865": "How is a mere girl, saving your presence, to do this at all?",
  "45866": "About the property?",
  "45867": "Is it possible the king could have condescended so far as to express himself so favorably of me?",
  "45868": "Is there any wrong you consider I've done you?",
  "45869": "Who gave you leave to do so?",
  "45870": "Was I right to play the part, or wrong to play the part?",
  "45871": "Not bad news, I hope?",
  "45872": "Could I seek to woo, and rivet to myself forever, the entire and virgin affections of another while there was a possibility that I might compare and regret?",
  "45873": "Do you think I could suffer more?",
  "45874": "Could it ever have been imagined that the correspondence of the army, to whom he addressed this proclamation, teemed with accusations against him?",
  "45875": "Can you understand this monstrous punishment, this slow, perpetual laceration of a mother's heart, this abominable, endless waiting?",
  "45876": "Of what importance, then, is the materiality of the punishment?",
  "45877": "What can we do to save him?",
  "45878": "Have you experienced it?",
  "45879": "Had the hour of adversity come?",
  "45880": "Do you mean to say he has the presumption to hope to pass from intendant to superintendent?",
  "45881": "Tell me how?",
  "45882": "What did it taste like?",
  "45883": "Why should we disappear and give place to others, when we may still, if we choose, remain in the front rank and lead the battle?",
  "45884": "How will the document read?",
  "45885": "But why in the world do these look upon the ground?",
  "45886": "How do you pig together?",

  "45893": "What is there yet in a sonne?",
  "45894": "The inevitable?",
  "45895": "And if he was invis'ble, and the bears invis'ble, who knows that they really ate him up?",
  "45896": "What did you mean to complain of today?",
  "45897": "What do you mean by letting any one in here?",
  "45898": "But is it a just idea?",
  "45899": "What if the chains should break under its enormous weight?",

  "45907": "And what were the reforms of which we speak?",
  "45908": "It was a good trick you played on us last year?",
  "45909": "Is it doubted that it would restore the national authority and national prosperity and perpetuate both indefinitely?",
  "45910": "How much is it worth?",

  "45914": "To what do you refer?",
  "45915": "What do you say of that young man?",
  "45916": "Of the three individuals, which has the greatest experience of all the pleasures which we enumerated?",
  "45917": "Why did you not wait for me, sir, to escort me downstairs?",
  "45918": "Would you like to go into my study?",
  "45919": "Have you not taken a bastion?",
  "45920": "You wish to speak to me alone?",
  "45921": "Passepartout?",
  "45922": "Who said that you were to go away?",
  "45923": "And, if he did not assist her, who would do so?",
  "45924": "So you're not afraid of getting fat?",
  "45925": "What science can there be in a matter in which, as in all practical matters, nothing can be defined and everything depends on innumerable conditions, the significance of which is determined at a particular moment which arrives no one knows when?",
  "45926": "Well, and what have you to say to me?",
  "45927": "Did you not?",
  "45928": "Am I taken prisoner or have I taken him prisoner?",
  "45929": "Do you think that a good man and a bad must share the same fate, and alike die, and end?",
  "45930": "What do you go for, then?",
  "45931": "What is this, then?",
  "45932": "Did you want him too to go sailing about amid all kinds of hardship while others are eating up his estate?",
  "45933": "You do like it?",
  "45934": "And now you know all that you want to know, do you not?",
  "45935": "How should he dare to seek the bottom of it?",

  "45938": "In what way did you go thither?",
  "45939": "Well, what do you want me to do?",
  "45940": "You know something about him, do you not, madame?",
  "45941": "Presumed?",
  "45942": "Will not the man of the learned profession, who will feel a neutrality to the rivalships between the different branches of industry, be likely to prove an impartial arbiter between them, ready to promote either, so far as it shall appear to him conducive to the general interests of the society?",
  "45943": "Is it all right?",
  "45944": "Can they go on, my father?",
  "45945": "Shall we go on upstairs?",
  "45946": "Or is this a season to revel in?",
  "45947": "You've j'ined a college by this time, I suppose?",
  "45948": "And exactly the same thing happened to both of you?",
  "45949": "Shall we follow you?",
  "45950": "Why not exclude every man convicted of any degrading legal crime, even petty larceny?",
  "45951": "You surely do not mean to let the child dine at eight o'clock?",
  "45952": "Well, what are we to do?",
  "45953": "By whom can he have been instigated?",
  "45954": "Has he taken off his doublet?",
  "45955": "Have you a sumptuous table, a dashing wife, and gold to scatter, in order to attract them to your suite?",
  "45956": "Did I not understand you to say that, as the consequence of the collision, the character of the comet's orbit has been changed?",
  "45957": "Why, too, should he write a letter now, rather than six years ago?",
  "45958": "All ready?",
  "45959": "Might she have loved me?",
  "45960": "What can you do then?",
  "45961": "Your daughter?",
  "45962": "But where is she?",
  "45963": "But can this be possible?",
  "45964": "No, you do not, do you?",
  "45965": "What help do you want from me?",
  "45966": "Tell me at once that I want to assassinate you?",
  "45967": "Is it not those very persons who mourn for him?",
  "45968": "Did you ever know anybody who was born to it besides myself?",
  "45969": "The first?",
  "45970": "Will he continue, then, to keep our secret?",
  "45971": "All your naughty purposes, I make no doubt, were quite changed?",
  "45972": "Despair?",
  "45973": "What does that mean?",
  "45974": "SHALL I TURN THE SCORPION?",
  "45975": "No letter that can possibly have been overlooked?",
  "45976": "Now, father, may I marry my lass?",
  "45977": "Can I, in a theatre, occupy at the same time one place in the pit, another in the boxes, and a third in the gallery?",

  "45983": "What would the minister have said, mother?",
  "45984": "Do you suppose that I am afraid to die?",
  "45985": "How many all told?",
  "45986": "What letters?",
  "45987": "Will it not be better that she should keep the resentment of the insult for ever?",
  "45988": "What could be the cause of this phenomenon?",
  "45989": "Or whether it eats and drinks?",
  "45990": "But what would you say in it?",
  "45991": "May I go up and speak to her?",
  "45992": "Manager of the company or the house?",
  "45993": "Did he think I'd flinch from his bottle?",
  "45994": "Did they want to cut his chin off?",
  "45995": "But how did my father know that I had gone this road and in this dress?",

  "46007": "But what I mean is, where do I come in?",
  "46008": "If you have an officer and he does wrong, do you suffer him to remain in office, or do you set up another in his stead?",
  "46009": "Where, then, does monopoly get this singular virtue, which the etymology of the word and the vulgar aspect of the thing would never lead us to suspect?",
  "46010": "Do you understand what that means?",
  "46011": "What are you up to?",
  "46012": "It is only, is it, because we have made no defence, and have led them into a false supposition?",
  "46013": "Are they equals in the same sense in which absolute equality is equal?",
  "46014": "What does he do to prevent further misfortune?",

  "46423": "You have the means, then, of touching him?",
  "46424": "He was the only passenger who came on board in the dead of the night?",
  "46425": "Will you hear what my idea is, the plan I have conceived?",
  "46426": "What can we say?",
  "46427": "What did you say of me, that I did not deserve?",
  "46428": "Then when the person who asks me is not in his right mind I am by no means to make the return?",
  "46429": "Will you wait?",
  "46430": "What's on?",

  "46473": "And what shall I do?",
  "46474": "What is his general condition?",
  "46475": "But what was he to do there?",
  "46476": "Is there anything you want?",
  "46477": "Citizens, whither are we going?",
  "46478": "How was that?",
  "46479": "Having effected this, they will proceed to trace an outline of the constitution?",
  "46480": "Whereabouts is the one you are speaking of?",
  "46481": "Why, what share have you got?",
  "46482": "The speeches made to them by the emperors, were they not at length of the same nature as those formerly pronounced to the people by the consuls and the tribunes?",
  "46483": "Even the longing for the tiara?",
  "46484": "In whose interest are you acting, may I ask?",
  "46485": "But can I help it, if I love him?",
  "46486": "Why, how do I know?",
  "46487": "Have you been satisfied with him this voyage?",
  "46488": "Have you been engaged to be married?",
  "46489": "Of what materials was I made that I could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of the wheel, continually renewed the torture?",
  "46490": "Can you tell me that?",
  "46491": "But what did I gain by this?",
  "46492": "And you, cadi, why do you act so?",
  "46493": "I think that even in your day you had found one or two of the easier, the bigger ones?",
  "46494": "Besides, of what use are the husbandmen to this community?",
  "46495": "When can you come?",
  "46496": "How did you manage it?",
  "46497": "Pip, what time is it?",
  "46498": "Was he to be pointed at as the consumer of the bread of the poor, and to be allowed no means of refuting such charges, of clearing his begrimed name, of standing innocent in the world, as hitherto he had stood?",
  "46499": "But if he should be a cavalier?",
  "46500": "Sure?",
  "46501": "And do you not also think, as I do, that the harsh feeling which the many entertain towards philosophy originates in the pretenders, who rush in uninvited, and are always abusing them, and finding fault with them, who make persons instead of things the theme of their conversation?",
  "46502": "What do you think your uncle would say if he knew?",
  "46503": "Had she not prayed for guidance?",
  "46504": "What is this new business?",
  "46505": "Do you know what it was?",
  "46506": "What news, what news, good woman?",
  "46507": "Is anything gained by that?",
  "46508": "And on whose part does this messenger come?",
  "46509": "It's impossible?",
  "46510": "Would it have been desirable to have composed the court for the trial of impeachments, of persons wholly distinct from the other departments of the government?",
  "46511": "But what do I care?",
  "46512": "What is your address there?",
  "46513": "But where is the cart?",
  "46514": "What, then?",
  "46515": "Are there any flowers that look like bells?",
  "46516": "Now what idea have we of these bodies?",
  "46517": "How, what?",
  "46518": "Terrible?",
  "46519": "Large tract of marshes about here, I believe?",
  "46520": "What will you have if you go back?",
  "46521": "And what do I care, what do I care about you, and whether you go to ruin there or not?",
  "46522": "Which gate did you come to?",
  "46523": "He is well?",
  "46524": "Who will these men be?",
  "46525": "Shall I come to seek your majesty, or shall I wait?",
  "46526": "How many do you suppose there were?",
  "46527": "What is, after all, this electoral reform which the people grasp at, as if it were a bait, and which so many ambitious persons either call for or denounce?",
  "46528": "What will be the result, then?",
  "46529": "What are you looking at?",
  "46530": "First met with father here?",
  "46531": "I never heard of one refusing to trade for greenbacks, and if the men on guard could not be restrained by these stringent laws, what hope could there be of restraining anybody else?",
  "46532": "You did not fight, then?",
  "46533": "What have we gained by your expedition?",

  "46535": "Why are you crying?",
  "46536": "How did you get such thick thick knees?",
  "46537": "Meaning mine, sir?",
  "46538": "Of what nature?",
  "46539": "Where is law?",
  "46540": "It's interesting, eh?",
  "46541": "Has any of your friends ever picked a flower from the wonderful plant?",
  "46542": "I pray, then, that I may be told how it is possible to make appeal to the principles of sociability, fraternity, and solidarity, when society itself rejects every solidary and fraternal transaction?",
  "46543": "Will you promise not to press one question on me, if I beg you not to ask it?",
  "46544": "Tell me, monsieur, is the office of superintendent a permanent position?",
  "46545": "The whale no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler?",
  "46546": "What else was government for?",
  "46547": "And what man was ever able to give a more touching proof of his affection than you can to now?",
  "46548": "Come, shall I call mamma?",

  "46552": "Florestan?",
  "46553": "You are not going to, after all?",
  "46554": "What is that?",
  "46555": "Is it not advisable to provide some measure of equitable retaliation in our relations with governments which discriminate against our own?",

  "46788": "What at my glory ever looks askance?",
  "46789": "Could you tell me if this was so?",
  "46790": "Had his astute mind guessed the secret, then?",
  "46791": "Is not that it, sire?",
  "46792": "Would you have them turning on me the way that I'd be roaring to the dawn of day with the wind upon my heart?",
  "46793": "So that, but for this marriage, she would have been your heir?",
  "46794": "Why was one to be forced to affirm it?",
  "46795": "Do not all words lie to the light ones?",
  "46796": "But how are we to educate the people?",
  "46797": "And what IS your remedy?",

  "47575": "And now why are you here?",
  "47576": "Ratafia, fool?",
  "47577": "If you have, how can you keep away from me?",
  "47578": "You will remember what I said?",
  "47579": "But the boat?",
  "47580": "You were not certain my child was dead, and you buried it?",
  "47581": "What does it matter to you?",
  "47582": "What is the amount of truth that springs from your laws, and what amount of justice springs from your tribunals?",
  "47583": "O wheres the author of this endles woe?",
  "47584": "But pray what did he say, when I was gone?",
  "47585": "Having found so many good people in my youth, why do I find so few in my age?",
  "47586": "You only intend, then, to dispose of that part of your fortune which the law allows you to subtract from the inheritance of your son?",
  "47587": "And the fault of the parents on whom?",
  "47588": "You are alone?",
  "47589": "Do my countrymen need any assurance that such a catastrophe is not to overtake them while I possess the power to stay it?",
  "47590": "And why do I ask you?",
  "47591": "Am I to drive you to the entrance?",
  "47592": "How has he accomplished this?",
  "47593": "What were you doing, sir, up in that billiard saloon?",
  "47594": "To hang me out for the scorn of all my acquaintance?",
  "47595": "What would have happened if she had not lost that necklace?",
  "47596": "But since he admits, that all their property may be increased fivefold, why should he not allow the same increase to the country?",
  "47597": "Wherefore all these ceaseless toilings?",
  "47598": "If a thing is iron, then what?",
  "47599": "Did you believe that I was a deserter?",
  "47600": "And what about the maid?",
  "47601": "Her letting you see?",
  "47602": "Where to?",
  "47603": "Is it not our interest, sir, to betray distrust?",
  "47604": "How can you do it?",
  "47605": "Was she unique?",
  "47606": "Am I hindering anyone?",
  "47607": "How have you done all this week?",
  "47608": "Has it ever happened to you?",
  "47609": "And wherefore was it glorious?",
  "47610": "Is it likely to be more terrifying than my captivity has been sad and gloomy?",
  "47611": "His name?",
  "47612": "Anything new at the office?",
  "47613": "Lay hold on me, sir, for what?",
  "47614": "Was there any use?",
  "47615": "To get married?",
  "47616": "On what ground, we ask, is the proprietor entitled to this rent?",
  "47617": "Where does it lead to?",
  "47618": "And do you take the oldest or the youngest, or only those of ripe age?",
  "47619": "But I want to know where from?",
  "47620": "Who's somebody?",
  "47621": "That is your opinion, is it not?",
  "47622": "Then what do you suggest that we do?",
  "47623": "Could any amount of immorality have placed him in a much worse one?",
  "47624": "Do you see that there is a way in which you could make them all yourself?",
  "47625": "You were one of my pupils, you say?",
  "47626": "Will the reader believe it?",
  "47627": "You never find that anything goes off here accidentally, do you, my dear friend?",
  "47628": "At what hour does the examination take place?",
  "47629": "Which way did he go?",
  "47630": "Then labor is not to be paid alike?",
  "47631": "And you, queen?",
  "47632": "Will you both come to the shop with me?",
  "47633": "Now whither can I turn?",
  "47634": "If the dogs had scratched the sand up in excavating, how had they carried it so far?",
  "47635": "You will bring him, then?",
  "47636": "What is he, after all, they would say?",
  "47637": "Again?",
  "47638": "He has not, has he?",
  "47639": "Are you in debt again?",
  "47640": "Which of them is it that you seek?",
  "47641": "Are the great old houses gaols?",
  "47642": "Did that other creature come to the same end?",
  "47643": "How much money have you?",
  "47644": "Now I am sure you can eat another breakfast?",
  "47645": "And my silliness is part of my charm?",
  "47646": "Archer?",
  "47647": "THAT wretched creature?",
  "47648": "Should I, who never do ill to any person, be the innocent means of doing it to my friends?",
  "47649": "What has he been doing all this time?",
  "47650": "Shall I, the queen, be able, then, to bear off no prize?",
  "47651": "What's a single man, I ask you, eating a bit in one house and drinking a sup in another, and he with no place of his own, like an old braying jackass strayed upon the rocks?",
  "47652": "Is it less than just that you should suffer as you have caused others to suffer?",
  "47653": "And what said the abbe?",
  "47654": "Would it do?",
  "47655": "Had all these houses sprung up overnight, and these streets been pushed across the meadows in a day?",
  "47656": "How was I to know?",
  "47657": "And what is the real cost of the land?",
  "47658": "Do you wish it?",
  "47659": "Husband come back?",
  "47660": "Who triumphs now?",
  "47661": "And who was the lady?",
  "47662": "Why are you silent?",
  "47663": "Is it right then that the rich, the few, should have the supreme power?",
  "47664": "And, again, what is the meaning of the colours being widely different in the males and females of certain species, and alike in the two sexes of other species of the same genus?",
  "47665": "Where will you be safe?",
  "47666": "Do?",
  "47667": "Do I make it clear?",
  "47668": "Even hating?",
  "47669": "Are you sure, sir?",
  "47670": "Is that all you want?",
  "47671": "Well, what have you to say?",
  "47672": "How do you dare to disturb me in the exercise of my functions?",
  "47673": "But what manner of man is he, lad?",
  "47674": "What can we do to raise your spirits, dear mama?",
  "47675": "Did he do it?",
  "47676": "And the boy is dying, you say?",
  "47677": "And the chariot?",
  "47678": "How long ago was it?",
  "47679": "Why do you wander so much in it yourself if you so dislike it?",
  "47680": "What in the world for?",
  "47681": "What sort of instances do you mean?",
  "47682": "Why tarry we?",
  "47683": "Word of honor?",
  "47684": "How, so looking, can she pass unnoticed?",
  "47685": "Who was that came in?",
  "47686": "What movement was ever spontaneous in any true sense of the word?",
  "47687": "Who has not an ass's ears?",
  "47688": "Ah, if only he would have made this demand of her?",
  "47689": "What is your name, then?",
  "47690": "Sixteen leagues?",
  "47691": "Are the lads asleep?",
  "47692": "And can all this be true, think you?",
  "47693": "Would not one say he was speaking of a religious community?",
  "47694": "Were they permitted to indulge these cannibal propensities at the expense, not of the flocks, but of the shepherds of the provinces?",
  "47695": "Why, whatever is the matter, my dearest?",
  "47696": "What else could she spect on him?",
  "47697": "How can it be otherwise?",
  "47698": "What have ye, brothers?",
  "47699": "Come, it is worth thinking about?",
  "47700": "Did I?",
  "47701": "What, in the name of peace, do you mean?",
  "47702": "Jane, will you have a flower?",
  "47703": "Now, then, what do you want?",
  "47704": "Shall we go and sit outside on the terrace?",
  "47705": "What is the evidence he produces?",
  "47706": "CAN anyone be unhappy, really?",
  "47707": "Whither does that way go?",
  "47708": "Come now, will you answer?",
  "47709": "But, monsieur, how can I thank you for the great kindness you have done me?",
  "47710": "Are you guilty, or not guilty?",
  "47711": "Outside the pale of that holy thing, justice, by what right does one form of man despise another?",
  "47712": "Moved again?",
  "47713": "Had she understood?",
  "47714": "How would you have had it?",
  "47715": "How long is it since I went down?",
  "47716": "You know me, then?",
  "47717": "What is the cost, sir?",
  "47718": "Have I ever refused my duty, sir?",
  "47719": "What do I here seek?",
  "47720": "You cannot then confide in the nature of my wishes?",
  "47721": "Would you have had me, sir?",
  "47722": "Did you make my gruel?",
  "47723": "I helped her to escape?",
  "47724": "And the anticipations of future pleasures and pains are of a like nature?",
  "47725": "Is there anything in the character of the accused persons which makes the accusation probable?",
  "47726": "Can you recollect all that?",
  "47727": "And why cannot I reconcile myself to the prospect of death?",
  "47728": "Can he stand that ordeal?",
  "47729": "And where is this signature?",
  "47730": "And your reason?",
  "47731": "As an adventuress, or by chance meetings?",
  "47732": "Well, how about the little jaunt?",
  "47733": "What's to prevent our having a person that we CAN depend upon, and enjoying the delight of doing a good action at the same time?",
  "47734": "Really, then?",
  "47735": "Practise meditation?",
  "47736": "Could you have a motive for the trust, that was not honourable and flattering to me?",
  "47737": "How could springs break through such walls as these?",
  "47738": "No, why disturb the old fellow?",
  "47739": "And now did it all end in those ravings of hate, and in that glazing gaze of terror?",
  "47740": "And what about the green mist?",
  "47741": "Where did you put it?",
  "47742": "Now, my friends, are any of you obtuse enough to swallow that?",
  "47743": "Do I perceive the whereabouts of the coach which I hear rattling by my window, or does reasoning play its part in giving me information?",
  "47744": "What would it matter if everybody knew it?",
  "47745": "How shall we find his where, and having found it, how can we destroy?",
  "47746": "Who will go with you?",
  "47747": "What was I asaying?",
  "47748": "Well, a cup of coffee, my friend?",
  "47749": "Had she never asked the gardeners?",
  "47750": "What flowed from the first?",
  "47751": "And for how long?",
  "47752": "Is this the worst fate you can think of for me?",
  "47753": "Are the other effigies, which are burned in the spring and midsummer bonfires, susceptible of the same explanation?",
  "47754": "Was it right to kiss his mother or wrong to kiss his mother?",
  "47755": "Whose, then?",
  "47756": "Suppose I say to a man, how much?",
  "47757": "Do you imagine that all those who came to flatter me were sincere?",
  "47758": "What is holding one's breath?",
  "47759": "I trust, monsieur, you come authorized to treat for the surrender of the place?",
  "47760": "And which are the soft or drinking harmonies?",
  "47761": "Have you succeeded?",
  "47762": "My hay to supply all the farmers in the district?",
  "47763": "Why do you not take your chance and be arrested with me?",
  "47764": "What was his life?",
  "47765": "What generally?",
  "47766": "Shall the despair of success make me assert, that I am here possest of an idea, which is not preceded by any similar impression?",
  "47767": "But wherefore all this labour, all this strife?",
  "47768": "What is this folly?",
  "47769": "And after that?",
  "47770": "Brackish or salt?",
  "47771": "Who is come?",
  "47772": "But the beasts are better than the people, and why should they not have all the good things the people have?",
  "47773": "So you're not angry with me?",
  "47774": "Who are they?",
  "47775": "Here, sire?",
  "47776": "How is your little affair coming along?",
  "47777": "When the eve is cool?",
  "47778": "Had I first sought after his mistress?",
  "47779": "He would not take them?",
  "47780": "What talk is this?",
  "47781": "And, if the moon is lighter than the other elements why is it opaque and not transparent?",
  "47782": "Do you permit us to open this casket?",
  "47783": "Will you refuse me?",
  "47784": "What do you call this or that?",
  "47785": "Me?",
  "47786": "What was your opinion, monsieur?",
  "47787": "Is it agreed?",
  "47788": "What is to be expected of, or by, such profligates?",
  "47789": "What are you in a fright about now?",
  "47790": "Is it not best for it to do so?",
  "47791": "When does the porter open that door?",
  "47792": "The government's?",
  "47793": "Who do you mean?",
  "47794": "Impossible?",
  "47795": "Is that your name?",
  "47796": "Was there nothing to identify this man?",
  "47797": "Have you kitchens here?",
  "47798": "What was I saying?",
  "47799": "Yes, what about them?",
  "47800": "How do you expect me to find any if I hide in the woods?",
  "47801": "What did he say in his last hours?",
  "47802": "Of what materials can that heart be composed, which can melt when insulted, and instead of revolting at injustice, kiss the rod?",
  "47803": "Who was her mother?",
  "47804": "May I ask you to be so good as to leave this room?",
  "47805": "What do you see in her out of the way?",
  "47806": "Do you yet doubt?",
  "47807": "Shall I give you an illustration?",
  "47808": "And have you those excellent receipts, madam, to keep yourselves from bearing of children?",
  "47809": "But how is there a session before the recent election returns are in?",
  "47810": "Well, what are you standing there for, you sca'cwow?",
  "47811": "It has more than one, then, miss?",
  "47812": "Much more, how comprehend his face, when face he has none?",
  "47813": "Well, and your wife?",
  "47814": "What desperate debt are you thinking of?",
  "47815": "What shall be the measure of retribution?",
  "47816": "Can it be sin to know?",
  "47817": "And that I there met with a very lucky chance?",
  "47818": "And you veiled it?",
  "47819": "That's another way of fighting, I suppose?",
  "47820": "But the writing?",
  "47821": "Of course, sir, you will begin soon to educate your son yourself?",
  "47822": "Did you observe any thing peculiar about it?",
  "47823": "If the act is not repealed, what do you think will be the consequences?",
  "47824": "Is it too late?",
  "47825": "Is it true?",
  "47826": "Would you deal lighter blows rather than heavier ones?",
  "47827": "Will you allow me to live there with them?",
  "47828": "What can you possibly want to know of circuses then?",
  "47829": "And now will this attempt, unprecedented in the annals of travels, lead to any practical result?",
  "47830": "What portion awaited those enemies?",
  "47831": "But where is my court?",
  "47832": "With what intention?",
  "47833": "He'll simply, he'll insistently have lied?",
  "47834": "What does he want to advertise for?",
  "47835": "Has he been here since?",
  "47836": "But who may abide the day of his appearing?",
  "47837": "In falsetto?",
  "47838": "Will the best of those we bade come hither to this land?",
  "47839": "Think I'm afraid of such as you?",
  "47840": "But you, gentlemen, then, have never heard the catastrophe of the BRITANNIA, mentioned?",
  "47841": "Yes?",
  "47842": "Are you dying for him?",
  "47843": "Did it lie in some tangled depth of philosophy?",
  "47844": "In what place, sir?",
  "47845": "Will you not embrace it?",
  "47846": "Can you tell me where I could get employment of any kind?",
  "47847": "But what is temptation?",
  "47848": "Would you put tricks upon travellers?",
  "47849": "What will you give me if I deliver you from the sheep?",
  "47850": "Wish to tend to him?",
  "47851": "But what could she do?",
  "47852": "Do you believe that he thinks of it much?",
  "47853": "Is this carriage for me?",
  "47854": "But what about her husband?",
  "47855": "Has the latter a right to prevent D from selling?",
  "47856": "Then, who taught you?",
  "47857": "Before the end of the week?",
  "47858": "You say?",
  "47859": "Did you really think I was the kind of girl to roll about on the floor and whine for mercy?",
  "47860": "And again I ask, what is all this labor to do for you?",
  "47861": "Say you so?",
  "47862": "Are you an independent woman?",
  "47863": "Unwell?",
  "47864": "And why do you believe that?",
  "47865": "How do you know it is the doctor?",
  "47866": "O my brethren, is not everything AT PRESENT IN FLUX?",
  "47867": "What philosophy taught this doctrine?",
  "47868": "Did she really imagine that he and she could live like this?",
  "47869": "Have they sold me up, then?",
  "47870": "Why, did she swim in some special way, then?",
  "47871": "Do you think they do?",
  "47872": "When you were young?",
  "47873": "Dare he risk it?",
  "47874": "Are they any wiser?",
  "47875": "Some one?",
  "47876": "Naccident?",
  "47877": "You know my conditions?",
  "47878": "But suppose you had really fallen short, do you think your superlative merit entitles you to greater indulgence than others?",
  "47879": "Is it possible, that the conclusion, which is here justly quoted, can any ways follow from the doctrine laid down?",
  "47880": "And what shall I do?",
  "47881": "Why should I be calm?",
  "47882": "What could he do now but marry her or run away?",
  "47883": "But how about you?",
  "47884": "Is the king asleep?",
  "47885": "Is there one among the sex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?",
  "47886": "What wonder, then, that pity and benevolence, malice, and anger, being the same desires arising from different principles, should so totally mix together as to be undistinguishable?",
  "47887": "What was this excess of love?",
  "47888": "Are you going?",
  "47889": "What did she pretend was going to happen, and what, at the worst, could the poor girl do, even granting she wanted to do anything?",
  "47890": "You will intrust it to me?",
  "47891": "D'you reckon he could see anything?",
  "47892": "Do you know all the mystery of life and death?",
  "47893": "Sir?",
  "47894": "You are not joking, are you?",
  "47895": "Then the diamond is safe?",
  "47896": "What is the end and aim of our training?",
  "47897": "Perhaps now you will ask how much you are worth?",
  "47898": "What took place during that fatal minute?",
  "47899": "Get me to tell?",
  "47900": "Where, then, is the wonder, that they who see only a small part should judge erroneously of the whole?",
  "47901": "Is there anything more I can have the honour of doing for you, sir?",
  "47902": "What do you want to do to this good man?",
  "47903": "Would it not, my friend, be the height of rashness and presumption in you to prefer your private opinion to this immense weight of learning, sanctity, and authority?",
  "47904": "And what's our aid against so great a prince?",
  "47905": "You'd like to see it on, sister?",
  "47906": "With this offer?",
  "47907": "How can I tell?",
  "47908": "Have you ever been there?",
  "47909": "And you do not lie dead in some ditch under some stream?",
  "47910": "Do you think there will be a fight?",
  "47911": "Goes on how, my dear?",
  "47912": "Would you submit to those who govern ill?",
  "47913": "Expects me?",
  "47914": "And you think that will tell you anything?",
  "47915": "You know upon what I laid the greatest stress at the beginning of our conversation?",
  "47916": "And my head?",
  "47917": "What is any public question but a conglomeration of private interests?",
  "47918": "Why not get half a dozen cats to deal with them?",
  "47919": "Who could avoid loving him?",
  "47920": "What do I want with half your estate?",
  "47921": "What is that flicker in the sky?",
  "47922": "Let's know that first?",
  "47923": "Do you want to speak to me?",
  "47924": "Do you understand me?",
  "47925": "What prevents?",
  "47926": "Who could be this new suitor?",
  "47927": "Then they've not gone to bed yet?",
  "47928": "Do you think your friend in the city would like a piece of advice?",
  "47929": "Oh, will you take me to my husband?",
  "47930": "Hell do you call it?",
  "47931": "In what light, therefore, could I consider her false and mysterious conduct?",
  "47932": "What monk?",
  "47933": "Perhaps you have met him?",
  "47934": "Is he ready to go?",
  "47935": "Why does everyone, everyone worry and torment me?",
  "47936": "Are we not at the same time describing them both in superlatives, only that we may satisfy the demands of rhetoric?",
  "47937": "What are benefits, what is constancy, or merit?",
  "47938": "Fabantou?",
  "47939": "Have you seen him lately?",
  "47940": "What new calamity?",
  "47941": "Then you really consider we shall not be intruding if we pay our respects to him directly?",
  "47942": "Ergo tua perpetuus speeliuit limunia somnus?",
  "47943": "What did she say to you?",
  "47944": "How did his uncle think he was living?",
  "47945": "Is it not evident that a degree of local information and preparatory labor would be found in the several volumes of their proceedings, which would very much shorten the labors of the general legislature, and render a much smaller number of members sufficient for it?",
  "47946": "Do we see in nature any other higher form evolved out of the human body?",
  "47947": "Publicly?",
  "47948": "Why, then, should he, who was going in quest of such treasure, set any store by the poor utensils of his past life?",
  "47949": "Who can explain why certain young temperaments are liable to terrible emotions for the slightest cause, and may eventually become morbid and incurable?",
  "47950": "The captain has brought this condition upon himself, so why then should I risk subjecting my wife to unthinkable horrors in a probably futile attempt to save him from his own brutal folly?",
  "47951": "Do you know what my name is?",
  "47952": "But the baby?",
  "47953": "Is a doctrine conceivable which would so elevate the mind above this present state, and teach it so successfully to dare difficult things, and to be reckless of danger and pain?",
  "47954": "Am I in the other world?",
  "47955": "How do you think of acting?",
  "47956": "What have you done?",
  "47957": "A glass of srub and water, now?",
  "47958": "Do you see that idle lad riding while his old father has to walk?",
  "47959": "Cartouche?",
  "47960": "Now would I know whether you would have us understand by this same saying, as indeed you logically may, that formerly men were fools and in this generation are grown wise?",
  "47961": "Who could there be?",
  "47962": "What trick would it be?",

  "49164": "Do you want to hire any men?",
  "49165": "Did you come here to fetch me?",
  "49166": "In praising his generosity, who can mingle any censure for such manifest prudence?",

  "49178": "What sort of grim adventure was it on which I had embarked?",
  "49179": "Would you have done it?",
  "49180": "Will you not give up this plan?",
  "49181": "But could you not be mended?",
  "49182": "Does that seem like too much work?",
  "49183": "Who are these creatures?",

  "49203": "Are we really quite lost, your excellency?",
  "49204": "Look here, dear prince, BE so kind, will you?",
  "49205": "Is it not well that such men should be brought low?",
  "49206": "Do you not see how the old man who drives a cart looks anxiously about?",
  "49207": "What will you eat?",
  "49208": "You are right, clearness is what you wish, is it not?",
  "49209": "And you say this young man behaved himself well?",

  "49230": "So you're a messenger of victory, eh?",
  "49231": "Had he eyebrows like that?",
  "49232": "What is there I care for?",
  "49233": "Was it still night?",
  "49234": "Who was this almost beardless young man, who was so glacial and so generous, who knew people's names, who knew all their names, and who opened his purse to them, who bullied rascals like a judge, and who paid them like a dupe?",
  "49235": "Why came I here to cast away my life?",

  "49344": "Who cares for me?",
  "49345": "When passed?",
  "49346": "How is it going?",
  "49347": "If, however, your wish should be one impossible to fulfill?",

  "49409": "Why should they care if they were known?",
  "49410": "Man to beast?",
  "49411": "But what's the use of talking?",
  "49412": "Carter?",
  "49413": "A pair of gloves?",
  "49414": "Why, for instance, should it be said that the liberty of the press shall not be restrained, when no power is given by which restrictions may be imposed?",
  "49415": "Heard what?",

  "49428": "Is it not natural that the madman, ignorant of his folly, should attempt things beyond his power?",
  "49429": "What do you call succeeding?",
  "49430": "You leave me, then?",
  "49431": "Then you have some new idea?",
  "49432": "And what is that to you?",
  "49433": "Is it the like of that murderer?",
  "49434": "But what can be their aim?",
  "49435": "I suppose there is no doubt that the mark was there yesterday?",

  "49460": "Do such people trouble themselves about the problems of social economy?",
  "49461": "What did I say?",
  "49462": "Did she strike you?",
  "49463": "Why do you not obey my orders to report strength and positions of your command?",
  "49464": "Should not a magistrate be not merely the best administrator of the law, but the most crafty expounder of the chicanery of his profession, a steel probe to search hearts, a touchstone to try the gold which in each soul is mingled with more or less of alloy?",

  "49505": "And was it only fancy which induced me to believe that, with the increase of my own firmness, that of my tormentor underwent a proportional diminution?",
  "49506": "Your hour?",
  "49507": "How did it happen that such a man had not been brought before a provost's court, on the return of the legitimate princes?",
  "49508": "Am I a captive?",
  "49509": "It was real, then?",
  "49510": "Is it a year, or more, or less?",
  "49511": "Why not possible?",

  "49525": "Why stop them?",
  "49526": "What if he gave me a place near him?",
  "49527": "Where would he naturally go?",
  "49528": "What is a sensitive person?",
  "49529": "Does he think it's manly, to torture a horse?",
  "49530": "What is the matter with you today?",
  "49531": "Why he not help my papa?",
  "49532": "Shall I come for a walk with you tonight when I've put the children to bed?",
  "49533": "What have I deserved for my sins but hell and everlasting fire?",
  "49534": "And how about food?",
  "49535": "What's that for?",
  "49536": "Two?",
  "49537": "But how will you bestow your time, when you will have no visits to receive or pay?",
  "49538": "Then they allow the lackey to remain with him?",
  "49539": "How long ago is it?",
  "49540": "Well, so much being disposed of, what is left?",
  "49541": "What is it you fear?",
  "49542": "Spilett?",
  "49543": "May I go with you, father?",
  "49544": "Whoever heard of a man sending for the police against himself?",
  "49545": "Will he have a grain of respect for you?",
  "49546": "For how, sir, shall you be able to learn whether or no I am superior to others of my sex both in goodness of heart and understanding, if I let you dine in my cloisters squalid and ill clad?",
  "49547": "Sir, are you here?",
  "49548": "But in extreames what patience shall I vse?",
  "49549": "How is my heart still moved when I think of your goodness?",
  "49550": "A lord?",
  "49551": "Do you leave me?",
  "49552": "Whether advocates and orators had liberty to plead in causes manifestly known to be unjust, vexatious, or oppressive?",
  "49553": "Where are you going, marechal?",
  "49554": "Who could hear unmoved of the fall of that which had been so great, and which had stood so long?",
  "49555": "Did he wish to wait until night, and leave the submarine passage secretly?",
  "49556": "Is there anything more?",
  "49557": "Because you're so sure he so really wants my company?",
  "49558": "And you have given up your cathedral work here?",
  "49559": "Am I to govern by another's will?",
  "49560": "What is it now?",
  "49561": "What of this kingdom?",
  "49562": "So we may not enter into transgression?",
  "49563": "Who dares mock at him?",
  "49564": "And these other people?",
  "49565": "But where are these latter stepping?",
  "49566": "But who made all those worlds, beaming so gloriously above us?",
  "49567": "Again, is not the passionate element wholly set on ruling and conquering and getting fame?",
  "49568": "Would they live years and years if no one helped them?",
  "49569": "So etherealised by spirit as he was, and so apotheosised by worshipping admirers, did his footsteps, in the procession, really tread upon the dust of earth?",
  "49570": "Both them ar chaps parsons?",
  "49571": "May I depart, monseigneur?",
  "49572": "What, straight from the station to my house?",
  "49573": "How do you think these garments fit me?",
  "49574": "What is all this for?",
  "49575": "Will it seem odd if I ask?",
  "49576": "Who or what speaks?",
  "49577": "Tell me, mind you ever to have had a lover?",
  "49578": "Does that person want you?",
  "49579": "Will he explain it?",
  "49580": "Was he to be carried back by the wind which had blown him there?",
  "49581": "What is to be done then?",
  "49582": "Where is a candle?",
  "49583": "May they not have believed, in fact, that it was a plant fallen from the sky, a gift of the divinity?",
  "49584": "Hearty, I thank you, said he, how be you?",
  "49585": "Whuzya think, hey?",
  "49586": "And why, then, did you not refuse him?",
  "49587": "Are you my friend?",
  "49588": "But the point is, had he money?",
  "49589": "What does he say?",
  "49590": "Am I to go to him and make a deed of conveyance?",
  "49591": "What is its consistency, if it extends many million miles from the sun's surface?",
  "49592": "Have you any one to depend on for assistance?",
  "49593": "What was the meaning of that fatigue, my friend?",
  "49594": "Perhaps it was only a false alarm that troubled you, and the enemy are not advancing?",
  "49595": "But now, how do you arrange your documents?",
  "49596": "Jacob's?",
  "49597": "No one else in your room?",
  "49598": "In his inexperience, he now asked himself with terror what game the girl was playing?",
  "49599": "Monsieur does not postpone an interview through prudence?",
  "49600": "How can I want to quarrel with you?",
  "49601": "Why had he disobeyed his father, who had been always so generous to him?",
  "49602": "Of what are you talking?",
  "49603": "Beauty?",
  "49604": "Are there women or are there not?",
  "49605": "Set out?",
  "49606": "Yet did I not first roughly kiss her as we danced?",
  "49607": "Well, and what may you have to say against this name?",
  "49608": "How do you like them?",
  "49609": "And he who is not on a voyage has no need of a pilot?",
  "49610": "But who will lead?",
  "49611": "But, my dear, is not this rather out of character?",
  "49612": "Or a woman?",
  "49613": "Well, if so, why do you object to my doing so?",
  "49614": "Are you the boy I've read of in the papers?",
  "49615": "Oh, what's wrong?",
  "49616": "And if he let go his hold?",
  "49617": "In what way has it a tendency to prove that?",
  "49618": "Who is at the door other than he?",
  "49619": "Are you still resolved to accompany me?",
  "49620": "What does he do?",
  "49621": "Why did you keep me waiting so long?",
  "49622": "Can I say of her innocent and girlish beauty, that it faded, and was no more, when its breath falls on my cheek now, as it fell that night?",
  "49623": "Do you know why?",
  "49624": "Why, what's the MATTER with you?",
  "49625": "My dear friend, what has happened?",
  "49626": "You had no idea of your impending good fortune, in those times?",
  "49627": "Do you think you can better yourselves, on that subject, by leaving us here under no obligation whatever to return those specimens of your movable property that come hither?",
  "49628": "Nice?",
  "49629": "Yet still I have my uses, uses that vanish in monotony, and still I must ask why should we bury the talent of these bright sensations altogether?",
  "49630": "And what was it this time last year?",
  "49631": "But what is theory?",
  "49632": "Then, sir, you are satisfied?",
  "49633": "And what if he had?",
  "49634": "And why is he here?",
  "49635": "That is your final decision?",
  "49636": "Do you remember what fun it often was when guests came in the evening?",
  "49637": "Well, how can I he of service to you?",
  "49638": "What was the use of squandering the days of his youth in an office when the world was beautiful?",
  "49639": "But, tell me, have they all one motion, both situ et tempore?",
  "49640": "And you selected it yourself?",
  "49641": "I know it, but in asking for news, I mean, have you done anything for me?",
  "49642": "What on earth have I done now?",
  "49643": "When does it become an idolum specus, the unreasonable pertinacity of a too sceptical mind?",
  "49644": "When will he be here?",
  "49645": "Something extraordinary must await us farther on, but, what?",
  "49646": "And do you really flatter yourself that I shall yield to all your caprices, and quietly and humbly await the time of again being received into your good graces?",
  "49647": "What had he come there to do?",
  "49648": "And how stands the fact?",
  "49649": "Do you ever work, child?",
  "49650": "You hear, sir?",
  "49651": "What would you do if you were in my place?",
  "49652": "The gentleman to whom I had the honour of being introduced?",
  "49653": "What am I to tell him?",
  "49654": "Where do you come from?",
  "49655": "Then why are we here, my friends?",
  "49656": "Boats in the royal service?",
  "49657": "What is your religion?",
  "49658": "Must it not, indeed, be told to the whole circle of her acquaintance before she could be made to stand all right with them?",
  "49659": "Verily, do I still live?",
  "49660": "All as it should be, is it not?",
  "49661": "Is that strong on him still?",
  "49662": "Do you want to go to all of them?",
  "49663": "What shall I think of this?",
  "49664": "Come, now, what do you want?",
  "49665": "Daae not see you come down from your room by the curious road which you selected?",
  "49666": "But as a man of honor should answer another, tell me fairly, shall you pay these with the same punctuality?",
  "49667": "And when doth this take place?",
  "49668": "But his stables had been searched?",
  "49669": "But, it will be asked further, can I make any use of this conception and hypothesis in my investigations into the world and nature?",
  "49670": "Of his own desire?",
  "49671": "Why should anyone pay?",
  "49672": "What do you wish of me?",
  "49673": "Pay?",
  "49674": "Home?",
  "49675": "And when?",
  "49676": "Does aught lie on it?",
  "49677": "Where have you sprung up from?",
  "49678": "To what class of society does he belong?",
  "49679": "How come?",
  "49680": "Where now are all your high resolves at last?",
  "49681": "And will no murmurs fill the courts above?",
  "49682": "When?",
  "49683": "Marriage?",
  "49684": "Then that is all quite settled, is it not?",
  "49685": "Or cometh it in person?",
  "49686": "What more can we do?",
  "49687": "What in the world does the man mean?",
  "49688": "What does anybody want here?",
  "49689": "Why, do you know how pretty you are, child?",
  "49690": "Will you not allow that I have as much of the spirit of prophecy in me as the swans?",
  "49691": "Shall we wait, or shall we charge?",
  "49692": "Ere I was old?",
  "49693": "What is this dim and ambiguous consciousness which, after a certain time, becomes purified, rectified, and, instead of taking itself for another, definitively apprehends itself as such?",
  "49694": "Do you know his man?",
  "49695": "Will you so?",
  "49696": "Who are the true martyrs, of those who are slain on my side, or on that of my enemies?",
  "49697": "Well, what hinders your sleeping?",
  "49698": "May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?",
  "49699": "What do you mean to say?",
  "49700": "How about prying?",
  "49701": "Then he could not have retreated down the road, and you say that there are no side roads?",
  "49702": "Yea, why should his father let him, if it come to that?",
  "49703": "Briefly, what did you glean?",
  "49704": "Gone, you say she is?",
  "49705": "Why does there come an hour when one emerges from this azure, and why does life go on afterwards?",
  "49706": "Do you think you will find that spring soon?",
  "49707": "How was I?",
  "49708": "And why do the children, the grandchildren, all the descendants of the first parents always return here?",
  "49709": "But then, what?",
  "49710": "Arm's length?",
  "49711": "Him as wos dead?",
  "49712": "What is its object?",
  "49713": "Are we never to educate ourselves to foresee such dangers and to prevent them before they happen?",
  "49714": "Why was she brought here?",
  "49715": "I, my lord?",
  "49716": "Am I really wonderful?",
  "49717": "Well, was there?",
  "49718": "What is she sentenced to?",
  "49719": "And how much for one that's all chewed up like this one?",
  "49720": "Were you alone during this conversation?",
  "49721": "Shall I have a nurse?",
  "49722": "Do you want to drown yourselves, or dash yourselves to pieces among these wheels?",
  "49723": "Was he anywhere near the big shed where we build the machines?",
  "49724": "But have we hydrogen enough to inflate a balloon?",
  "49725": "Has it a copper leg?",
  "49726": "What had she better do, or how was it expedient that she should treat him?",
  "49727": "The door key?",
  "49728": "Looked?",
  "49729": "What of that?",
  "49730": "Shall we let him in or not, if you are asleep?",
  "49731": "Repellently and stunningly clever?",
  "49732": "Where could you keep it?",
  "49733": "And that of a fluid body?",
  "49734": "Had HE his idea, and has he now, with you, anything more?",
  "49735": "Who took any?",
  "49736": "Was he true to them?",
  "49737": "Why should he not?",
  "49738": "Afraid of being heard?",
  "49739": "Will this ever take place in reality?",
  "49740": "What garden?",
  "49741": "Why should I go?",
  "49742": "On your life?",
  "49743": "No more?",
  "49744": "Is it you, sir?",
  "49745": "You will wait for me, then?",
  "49746": "Was it through the chimney?",
  "49747": "But what can I do, sister?",
  "49748": "Well, are you coming?",
  "49749": "It was from your wife, we supposed?",
  "49750": "And had I wasted some of the best years of my life to obtain a shadow?",
  "49751": "Ernest was much distressed, for he liked the cook, and, of course, wanted to know what all the matter was, who it was that had just gone off in the pony carriage, and why?",
  "49752": "It is, then, the cardinal's custom to walk in his orangery?",
  "49753": "Oh how great a confidence shall there be to the dying man whom no affection to anything detaineth in the world?",
  "49754": "He paid for them, did he not?",
  "49755": "And if the world perceives that what we are saying about him is the truth, will they be angry with philosophy?",
  "49756": "Can such men fall away from reality?",
  "49757": "Are those our barks, yonder?",
  "49758": "How dare you come here?",
  "49759": "What is a magician?",
  "49760": "How can one be in doubt about what one has heard with one's own ears and seen with one's own eyes?",
  "49761": "By some happy device?",
  "49762": "Is the wind favourable?",
  "49763": "Why did you let me do such a silly thing?",
  "49764": "What happiness on earth could be greater than the possession of such a love, had the true possession been justly and honestly within her reach?",
  "49765": "Why did he wish it?",
  "49766": "Excuse him?",
  "49767": "Can you get me the grammars if I promise to say it hereabout?",
  "49768": "Would he startle him with sudden fear?",
  "49769": "How would you like to come in on that with me?",
  "49770": "But are you flesh and blood?",
  "49771": "She's not in this house, for instance?",
  "49772": "What time do you get up to get breakfast?",
  "49773": "Have you not observed that the captain of your little vessel, on entering the roadstead, sent forward, in order to obtain permission to enter the port, a little boat bearing his logbook and the register of his voyagers?",
  "49774": "Well, and what do you mean to do with me?",
  "49775": "And you went asking money of him, or making talk of getting a wife would drive him from his farm?",
  "49776": "You include the grounds about the houses?",
  "49777": "What, then, remains?",
  "49778": "But are we not made better for the effort and sacrifice, and are not those we serve lifted up and blessed?",
  "49779": "What ship sail home to her haven?",
  "49780": "If a law is wrong how are we to make its immorality evident?",
  "49781": "You hear the charge?",
  "49782": "But what do I see?",
  "49783": "Jane, you understand what I want of you?",
  "49784": "How did feudalism end?",
  "49785": "How about the license?",
  "49786": "Price?",
  "49787": "What think you sir?",
  "49788": "Good faith?",
  "49789": "Confess what?",
  "49790": "Is this a time to be offering pardons, or renewing the long forgotten subjects of charters and taxation?",
  "49791": "Would you care to come and dine with me?",
  "49792": "What could she have done to you?",
  "49793": "And shall we begin at once?",
  "49794": "But would you be able for it, my boy?",
  "49795": "Surprised at this emphasis, I surveyed my valet, and, perceiving a wildness in his looks, asked if he had seen his grandfather's ghost?",
  "49796": "But you could find out?",
  "49797": "Was she pretty?",
  "49798": "Or will he say that to abolish corruption is a bad thing?",
  "49799": "With freedom to go everywhere, with easy access everywhere, with no dread of difficulties about language, coinage, custom, or law, why should everyone continue to go to just a few special places?",
  "49800": "And why did the body conceal itself?",
  "49801": "Jo, how could you?",
  "49802": "Is not all here yours?",
  "49803": "What other possible reason could there have been for her so blushing ?",
  "49804": "What made him seek this quarter of the house at an untimely season, when he should have been asleep in bed?",
  "49805": "Where can they have crossed?",
  "49806": "If such things are done in the green wood, what will be done in the dry?",
  "49807": "And whom he brought back this morning?",
  "49808": "Any references?",
  "49809": "Was not he believed to be dead?",
  "49810": "With whom are you going to fight?",
  "49811": "And why think you that will make him sad?",
  "49812": "But when will you come and see my study?",
  "49813": "My friends, why with us?",
  "49814": "What a carriage that was, and where did it come from, eh?",
  "49815": "But is that all your evidence?",
  "49816": "Why did you give him six pistoles?",
  "49817": "You deny it?",
  "49818": "Do you feel that you are a sufficiently practical man?",
  "49819": "How do you mean sad?",
  "49820": "What crime, then, have you committed?",
  "49821": "Did I tell you?",
  "49822": "Fwhat are you talkin' of?",
  "49823": "How could she, indeed?",
  "49824": "But, surely, there is some one in the world whom you love?",
  "49825": "And where is his corpse?",
  "49826": "Well, do you know what is taking place at this moment?",
  "49827": "And would you like to be here alone with her for a month?",
  "49828": "For instance, if you lived in the penal days?",
  "49829": "I say, what on earth's the matter?",
  "49830": "She has gone to visit friends?",
  "49831": "But why did men who were interpolating bronze corslets freely introduce bronze so seldom, if at all, as the material of greaves?",
  "49832": "And the men?",
  "49833": "Do you s'pose they would?",
  "49834": "Are you making fun of me?",
  "49835": "How could he possibly have doubted it?",
  "49836": "What is your theory, then?",
  "49837": "How may I tell you for what we were sunk here, when I do not know, unless it was because we were rich?",
  "49838": "But what good can one do oneself?",
  "49839": "And you're so great a favourite there, you say?",
  "49840": "Give up?",
  "49841": "When shall I have you here again?",
  "49842": "If she's charming, how can she help it?",
  "49843": "And discarding all consideration of political consequences, what unspeakable personal glory there would then be to him as a man?",
  "49844": "You'll not tell, will you?",
  "49845": "How could she ever suppose such a thing?",
  "49846": "Was it the same desperate confusion, or would the ground offer better facilities?",
  "49847": "Why, but will you leave him with so slight command, and infuse no more charge upon the fellow?",
  "49848": "You have the unspeakable effrontery to stand there and admit it?",
  "49849": "True?",
  "49850": "Who has not remarked the readiness with which the closest of friends and honestest of men suspect and accuse each other of cheating when they fall out on money matters?",
  "49851": "Very distant?",
  "49852": "Does his conscience ever entertain the question of his right to such subsidies?",
  "49853": "How shall I defile them?",
  "49854": "Can you strike a man to the heart and leave no mark on him?",
  "49855": "What's your hurry?",
  "49856": "If it be, how can that question have place, concerning the subsistence of self, under a change of substance?",
  "49857": "That?",
  "49858": "And in what light must I appear to the world?",
  "49859": "Marilla, have I really a pretty nose?",
  "49860": "On the other hand, what do we see?",
  "49861": "But what should we have been then?",
  "49862": "For are not milliners and mantuamakers reckoned the next class?",
  "49863": "She used to speak of me then?",
  "49864": "Could I ever forget?",
  "49865": "You think not, sir?",
  "49866": "Ran away with her?",
  "49867": "But do you?",
  "49868": "What sort of weather was it?",
  "49869": "And all for what?",
  "49870": "So that was the way they did it, eh?",
  "49871": "What admission?",
  "49872": "Should not each look after his own happiness, and will not the world be best carried on if everyone minds his own business and leaves other people to mind theirs?",
  "49873": "How can we get it?",
  "49874": "To enter in the wall?",
  "49875": "Is it important business?",
  "49876": "How dare you, sir, break it?",
  "49877": "Would you not sooner stay with me than with them?",
  "49878": "Do you fear that they might be stolen?",
  "49879": "Does she know it?",
  "49880": "What do you think of me?",
  "49881": "Who is it, and what's wanted?",
  "49882": "How it happened?",
  "49883": "What is it gives her the power to look down on everything, to be calm independently of everything?",
  "49884": "Tom, what is the matter?",
  "49885": "If upon the ocean, would any passing vessel be within hail to rescue them from their critical position?",
  "49886": "What is the use of your exertion, they would say, in accumulating wealth, which is doomed to melt away in the twinkling of an eye?",
  "49887": "But if you yourselves should be struck?",
  "49888": "Where shall the little boy ride to?",
  "49889": "And you owned up?",
  "49890": "Why did you, if you regret it?",
  "49891": "May I see if they have more scent than the others?",
  "49892": "To do what?",
  "49893": "Oh say, what sums that generous hand supply?",
  "49894": "But what must be done?",
  "49895": "Is there no wizardry within it?",
  "49896": "Davy?",
  "49897": "What position do you hold?",
  "49898": "Do you mean I'm to clean pots and pans and things?",
  "49899": "Is it empty?",
  "49900": "But how to get to him in safety?",
  "49901": "And why did he fire at us?",
  "49902": "Has he built one here, then?",
  "49903": "Will that satisfy you?",
  "49904": "Soft, who be these?",
  "49905": "What upon earth is to make them so?",
  "49906": "James's?",

  "50042": "What would your aunt have said to it?",
  "50043": "Could he be certain that some conjuncture would not occur which would bring the mysterious personage on the scene?",
  "50044": "Surely that is all simple and obvious?",
  "50045": "What is it that drove you, impelled you, to separate yourself from the great natural path of marriage and the family?",

  "50089": "Why are you so melancholy, brother?",
  "50090": "But let me see, how was it done?",
  "50091": "But we have no naval imagination, and who am I, that I should advance an opinion?",
  "50092": "Or to snare stags with cords and caltrops?",

  "50191": "Have I ever broken my word?",
  "50192": "How could it occur to her to examine the letter, to look at it critically as a profession of love?",
  "50193": "Since you had already given the matter publicity, why did you object just now, when I began to speak of it to my friends?",
  "50194": "So that old scoundrel's dead, is he?",
  "50195": "Now, what is the cause of this difference in the fortune of the philosopher and the mathematician, the former of whom follows the path of conceptions, while the latter pursues that of intuitions, which he represents, a priori, in correspondence with his conceptions?",

  "50206": "Deliciously restful, and you, my dear child, how did you sleep?",
  "50207": "Endless, did I say?",
  "50208": "Is it an insurrection?",
  "50209": "And if this person be not a smuggler, who is he?",
  "50210": "Care?",
  "50211": "You had worked that out, had you?",
  "50212": "What is the matter with you, my friend?",

  "50299": "The treaty?",
  "50300": "What happened to you?",
  "50301": "The sun is beautiful, is it not?",
  "50302": "Why should I preserve faith with him who never kept any with me?",
  "50303": "What kind of stock?",
  "50304": "You were at the festival of your marriage?",
  "50305": "When are you to be married?",
  "50306": "How did I ever bear it?",
  "50307": "Did he show it you himself?",
  "50308": "Warm?",
  "50309": "And his dreadful fate did not check the efforts of others to explore that river?",
  "50310": "And you'll be sure to come?",
  "50311": "And you'll drink something?",
  "50312": "Tell me, was it true?",
  "50313": "Now, then, do you wish for anything else?",
  "50314": "Neveroff a dreamer?",
  "50315": "And this man, my lord?",
  "50316": "Is she all he thinks her?",
  "50317": "Is it not mere tautology?",
  "50318": "What degree of authority does she claim for herself in virtue of the apostolical succession of her ministers?",
  "50319": "But you do forgive me?",
  "50320": "Is it probable that such a combination would exist at all?",
  "50321": "Then the fun would begin?",
  "50322": "What's wrong with you?",
  "50323": "Will your folks worry?",
  "50324": "What did I say?",
  "50325": "Now if it be true that the living come from the dead, then our souls must exist in the other world, for if not, how could they have been born again?",
  "50326": "After him?",
  "50327": "Who has the countersign?",
  "50328": "What does it all mean?",
  "50329": "Manage what?",
  "50330": "And what of the maker of the bed?",
  "50331": "What makes you think that poor young fellow could be an assassin?",
  "50332": "Should wages be governed by labor?",
  "50333": "Did you have any idea what sort of part you would like to get?",
  "50334": "To what circumstance do you allude?",
  "50335": "But you yourself?",
  "50336": "What vexed you?",
  "50337": "Or would she turn coldly away like all the hollow world?",
  "50338": "What did it matter how young or how old the girl might be?",
  "50339": "Is there none who holds the secret of these terrible bars?",
  "50340": "But she can make him keep her if he's married her?",
  "50341": "Was it right, for the sake of either of them, that an offer of marriage should be made at such a moment as this?",
  "50342": "What, what's the truth?",
  "50343": "To join the hussars?",
  "50344": "Why is that?",
  "50345": "Did you take any cold that night you half drowned me?",
  "50346": "And the cargo?",
  "50347": "What's he talking about?",
  "50348": "Is there a telegram for me?",
  "50349": "What do you think of that exploit, my lord?",
  "50350": "What is too heavy a price to pay for having duty made at once clear and easy of fulfilment instead of very difficult?",
  "50351": "What is she doing?",
  "50352": "Why is that?",
  "50353": "Why have the economists kept silent?",
  "50354": "Cause the people to enjoy the benefits of education?",
  "50355": "Still by one of your forty methods, your highness?",

  "50357": "Who asked my sister down to meet him?",
  "50358": "Must we make an autopsy?",
  "50359": "And permanently so?",
  "50360": "Are you coming along with me?",
  "50361": "What answer could be made to this?",
  "50362": "Shropshire?",
  "50363": "Are you going to drown me?",
  "50364": "Was he doing this?",
  "50365": "And how do you maintain yourselves in the requisite medium?",
  "50366": "Is it like anyone you know?",
  "50367": "And their driver?",
  "50368": "Would it be right for me to do so too?",
  "50369": "But why did you come hither?",
  "50370": "To believe what?",
  "50371": "What should I do then?",
  "50372": "Do you want to spread it all over?",
  "50373": "Is not this indeed, to understand charity well?",
  "50374": "On what principle is it that, when we see nothing but improvement behind us, we are to expect nothing but deterioration before us?",
  "50375": "If it is, in what does that necessity consist, what service does it perform, what is its business, and what are its merits?",
  "50376": "You are a financier, monsieur, I believe?",
  "50377": "Are you the gentleman?",
  "50378": "Where do you wish us to go?",
  "50379": "Should I marry?",
  "50380": "Does light require enlightenment?",
  "50381": "You are so false, and untrue, how could you know anything?",
  "50382": "Ah, you understand not a word of what she says?",
  "50383": "What is the intention of this fool's play, say then?",
  "50384": "Why should it be secret?",
  "50385": "Did you think I'd forget?",
  "50386": "Is his wife with him?",
  "50387": "Might we get closer to enlightenment?",
  "50388": "Is it a revolt?",
  "50389": "Why does he not come on?",
  "50390": "Your horse?",
  "50391": "What, silent still?",
  "50392": "Will you mind it, if I say something very, very silly?",
  "50393": "Were not the hours sometimes tedious even at home?",
  "50394": "What did he come for, then?",
  "50395": "Did you hear that are snap?",
  "50396": "What, has she been here?",
  "50397": "Fernand, do you mean?",
  "50398": "And also to be within and between them?",
  "50399": "Was this possible or that possible?",
  "50400": "You call me a cobweb?",
  "50401": "And you are ruined?",
  "50402": "Well, do you want to get in a comedy or on the vaudeville or in the chorus?",
  "50403": "What do you want to unsettle me for?",
  "50404": "Do you threaten me, madame?",
  "50405": "Must I confess?",
  "50406": "Are you unbaptized?",
  "50407": "My own showing?",
  "50408": "Was I mistaken?",
  "50409": "Who will discover this wonderful something?",
  "50410": "Destroyed?",
  "50411": "Did he excavate it?",
  "50412": "And where is the speaker?",
  "50413": "How are you and he getting on with your studies?",
  "50414": "Now is not this too bad?",
  "50415": "Besides, who but a prig would set himself high aims, or make high resolves at all?",
  "50416": "When, how, why had this hair been shut up in this drawer?",
  "50417": "How much weighs each bag of tools?",
  "50418": "Is she a political one?",
  "50419": "Does his mother then, keep poisons in her laboratory?",
  "50420": "Did I hinder you?",
  "50421": "Which was he to take?",
  "50422": "Who's that?",
  "50423": "Can you tell me?",
  "50424": "Or is she an elfish spirit, who, as the legends of our childhood taught us, is forbidden to cross a running stream?",
  "50425": "Why ask me?",
  "50426": "Which means?",
  "50427": "But in a government which is to be well founded, will it be best to admit of a community in everything which is capable thereof, or only in some particulars, but in others not?",
  "50428": "Will he agree?",
  "50429": "Shining, is it?",
  "50430": "Can he leave the island if he likes?",
  "50431": "But how is he now?",
  "50432": "A bird or a peacock?",
  "50433": "Speak, you old cent per cent fornicator?",
  "50434": "If it's any of my business, how the devil did you ever get into that bally jungle?",
  "50435": "Where does man come in?",
  "50436": "Should we be here now if they were brave?",
  "50437": "Sir?",
  "50438": "What had happened?",
  "50439": "Where is she staying?",
  "50440": "Did it spread towards other parts of the island?",
  "50441": "The garden?",
  "50442": "Do you think it's possible?",
  "50443": "I suppose they were government matches, then?",
  "50444": "You knew him?",
  "50445": "What was the fair lady's game?",
  "50446": "Is it war?",
  "50447": "I am still young, am I not?",
  "50448": "A great man?",
  "50449": "How did you get in if both houses were empty?",
  "50450": "Where could she be?",
  "50451": "Will you take me in your company?",
  "50452": "How do you expect me to know such things?",
  "50453": "Then the just soul and the just man will live well, and the unjust man will live ill?",
  "50454": "And how does he clean the boots?",
  "50455": "Has C, a hatter, the right to force D, his neighbor and also a hatter, to close his shop, and cease his business?",
  "50456": "When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did they not lick his blood?",
  "50457": "Where do you land?",
  "50458": "Yet you cried out?",
  "50459": "Perhaps the other gentleman called, sir?",
  "50460": "Do you know what that is a warning of?",
  "50461": "Have you turned the case over in your mind?",
  "50462": "Why should I not confess it, gentlemen?",
  "50463": "Am I worse than I believe myself to be?",
  "50464": "How about moving that drugget?",
  "50465": "But you had a gun and bayonet besides?",
  "50466": "Do I sing?",
  "50467": "What do I want?",
  "50468": "What man?",
  "50469": "At good profit?",
  "50470": "Carton?",
  "50471": "And advancing?",
  "50472": "Do you know any who belong to the latter category?",
  "50473": "Now, what do you say about her doctor?",
  "50474": "Who are these people?",
  "50475": "Could it be an impartial one?",
  "50476": "What do you down here, my friend?",
  "50477": "Could he suspect my true identity?",
  "50478": "And the women?",
  "50479": "Suppose I do not want to be happy, what is the source of the obligation?",
  "50480": "Or the generous deed out of selfishness?",
  "50481": "She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?",
  "50482": "Will he always come when you call him?",
  "50483": "And what has that to do with me?",
  "50484": "Why compliment him on being a romantic reactionary aristocrat?",
  "50485": "In the first place, and before everything else, sir, is the news as bad in your opinion as I am asked to believe?",
  "50486": "But how was it that the grooms knew it?",
  "50487": "Will you appoint a meeting for six months hence?",
  "50488": "Find it easy?",
  "50489": "Were they going over to the other side?",
  "50490": "So you will send me that book, dear count?",
  "50491": "But it's over now?",
  "50492": "Am I talking?",
  "50493": "And to what?",
  "50494": "How does he use it?",
  "50495": "You will sing with me?",
  "50496": "Grant?",
  "50497": "What did I borrow?",
  "50498": "Am I not clearly designated in that, captain?",
  "50499": "And with what purpose could he do that?",
  "50500": "What is it that this polypragmonetic ardelion to all the fiends of hell doth aim at?",
  "50501": "What means, then, this dithyramb upon property?",
  "50502": "What reason was there for assuming any probability of an uprising in the city?",
  "50503": "Ah, friends, what shall I do?",
  "50504": "Do we not both take from the poor people that which they can ill spare?",
  "50505": "What is the place, then, upon which we stand?",
  "50506": "Is he a man of fortune?",
  "50507": "How dare to repeat experiments that had failed so often?",
  "50508": "There is still another influence, what do you say to that?",
  "50509": "What makes you ask?",
  "50510": "Now, who can this other letter be from?",
  "50511": "But how is it he is not already returned?",
  "50512": "What is to be the manner of her death?",
  "50513": "Wizard?",
  "50514": "And, conversely, that which has less of truth will also have less of essence?",
  "50515": "You mean that they would shipwreck?",
  "50516": "Swinging by the chain?",
  "50517": "What put it into your head, little mother?",
  "50518": "Then it is very thin wine?",
  "50519": "Did I offer to hit him or did I not?",
  "50520": "And what temperature may that be?",
  "50521": "Have you a pair of silent shoes?",
  "50522": "Who else should do so?",
  "50523": "And to what effect?",
  "50524": "I shall meet them there, and who knows what future advantages may result from the interview?",
  "50525": "Could it have been aught but a shipwreck which had drawn it under the water?",
  "50526": "The song?",
  "50527": "Shall you go?",
  "50528": "How are you, my dear?",
  "50529": "Why then not trace the rights of man to the creation of man?",
  "50530": "How did you know about it?",
  "50531": "How about that?",
  "50532": "Who knows it?",
  "50533": "You were alluding to the jerking movement of my hand every time I try to reach for anything?",
  "50534": "What the devil was you afraid of?",
  "50535": "What did he do before he went?",
  "50536": "Your alphabet?",
  "50537": "What's up?",
  "50538": "Which house is that?",
  "50539": "What's your real name?",
  "50540": "Why were they so strangely silent?",
  "50541": "Is it an amusing story?",
  "50542": "Do you find the answer?",
  "50543": "Time to start?",
  "50544": "You understand?",
  "50545": "But how did you know that I was a prisoner back there?",
  "50546": "Wherein?",
  "50547": "Which do you prefer?",
  "50548": "What can be more gratifying than such a retrospect as this?",
  "50549": "Oh, indeed?",
  "50550": "Besides, which am I to choose?",
  "50551": "Instead, then, of consecrating monopolies from which the holders are to derive no privilege save that of straightway losing, with the income, all the enjoyment thereof, why not decree the agrarian law at once?",
  "50552": "But how could I, a poor dazed village lad, avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best and wisest of men fall every day?",
  "50553": "Well, why not?",
  "50554": "What does it all mean?",
  "50555": "Your father is dead?",
  "50556": "Of whom?",
  "50557": "Natasha, you would not deceive me?",
  "50558": "What were you doing in the battle, my friend?",
  "50559": "But does not this expose himself more than me?",
  "50560": "And is not this the reason why of old love has been called a tyrant?",
  "50561": "Why not take a number of banths and set them loose before us above ground?",
  "50562": "How long did he wear it?",
  "50563": "Is he not a prey which will always be within your grasp?",
  "50564": "What instructing do you think I should do?",
  "50565": "What took her away?",
  "50566": "Yes, how long?",
  "50567": "Is it not the separation of soul and body?",
  "50568": "It is said to have been a congestion of the brain, or apoplexy, which is the same thing, is it not?",
  "50569": "Executions?",
  "50570": "Have commissioned you to tell me what you have just stated?",
  "50571": "Remorse or regret?",
  "50572": "How am I to describe it?",
  "50573": "Tulkinghorn?",
  "50574": "Why are you smiling, prince?",
  "50575": "And if he had not, why did he take her again?",
  "50576": "That is your intention, is it not?",
  "50577": "Will it pass?",
  "50578": "Why did you pick him?",
  "50579": "Do you suppose these stoneless mounds hide no dust of what were men just as good?",
  "50580": "Where are those passionate eyes that appeal'd to my eyes in passion?",
  "50581": "What did she send?",
  "50582": "Should he find him at all?",
  "50583": "Why should I meddle?",
  "50584": "The earlier it might be, would it not be better?",
  "50585": "The theories say that, do they?",
  "50586": "And what hope was there that these designs would fail?",
  "50587": "Not from the photos I have showed you?",
  "50588": "Have you ever noticed that the ones we would love the most distractedly are those whom we never meet to know?",
  "50589": "Well, then, my lord, say, are you satisfied?",
  "50590": "Gentlemen, do you stare?",
  "50591": "Well, what do you want?",
  "50592": "Why, monsieur, what secret can you expect to find in the hollow head of a soldier?",
  "50593": "Are you going to return there?",
  "50594": "What need has it of exaggeration?",
  "50595": "What if she loves you now better than anyone?",
  "50596": "Do you happen to know any one in this neighbourhood who would receive him for a while on my paying for him beforehand?",
  "50597": "He has done his best, but what does a fish's best come to when the fish is out of water?",
  "50598": "You are a reactionary, then?",
  "50599": "What's up, anyhow?",
  "50600": "Will there, indeed?",
  "50601": "Who drove you to it?",
  "50602": "You are a wheelwright?",
  "50603": "Does that suit you?",
  "50604": "And shall we just carelessly allow children to hear any casual tales which may be devised by casual persons, and to receive into their minds ideas for the most part the very opposite of those which we should wish them to have when they are grown up?",
  "50605": "But did be profess any attachment?",
  "50606": "Who are you, madame?",
  "50607": "Boomer?",
  "50608": "Does he mean to say that?",
  "50609": "How much fudder is got for go?",
  "50610": "And when hereafter, for any cause, the people in this place shall desire to find new homes, if they wish to be rid of the institution, where will they find the place to go to?",
  "50611": "And what would their parents think of me, if they saw or heard the children rioting, hatless, bonnetless, gloveless, and bootless, in the deep soft snow?",
  "50612": "Will that suit you?",
  "50613": "Have I not explained your wishes, grandpapa?",
  "50614": "Did you see it?",
  "50615": "And, to be frank, my lord, was I wrong?",
  "50616": "From what?",
  "50617": "Herod?",
  "50618": "Cautious, why so?",
  "50619": "Was it the better to deceive them both?",
  "50620": "Did you tell us?",
  "50621": "Do you understand what you have done to me?",
  "50622": "Nor church?",
  "50623": "Will there be beds for me and all who seek?",
  "50624": "What virtue will there be then, said the monk, in their bullets of concupiscence, their habits and their bodies?",
  "50625": "How do I know?",
  "50626": "In what direction?",
  "50627": "And of such a man too?",
  "50628": "What good am I here?",
  "50629": "Do you mean what did I say?",
  "50630": "What did the whole world matter to them?",
  "50631": "You feel some pretty well now?",
  "50632": "The man says?",
  "50633": "How should I make a mistake?",
  "50634": "Will you have hash or fishballs for breakfast?",
  "50635": "What signifies?",
  "50636": "Did she mean to go out?",
  "50637": "Where is she?",
  "50638": "Do you know where they came from?",
  "50639": "Did you see him come out on us?",
  "50640": "Why lie awake nights worrying about this?",
  "50641": "And if I did not obey his call, who could answer for what might happen?",
  "50642": "Or worse than the parts they acted require?",
  "50643": "What did you go out for?",
  "50644": "Well, then, what's the sense in wasting the plates?",
  "50645": "Can we not, then, men of common sense, while awaiting the solution which the future will undoubtedly bring forth, prepare ourselves for this great transition by an analysis of the struggling powers, as well as their positive and negative qualities?",
  "50646": "Have you not lately renewed your promise?",
  "50647": "And why do we set our soul and body, which are such dear companions, at such variance?",
  "50648": "Living together?",
  "50649": "Did you never hear it?",
  "50650": "And what else is paper currency?",
  "50651": "And do you propose to make this journey very shortly?",
  "50652": "But what if fresh disasters should take place?",
  "50653": "Who will say they were not beautiful?",
  "50654": "But when?",
  "50655": "And what explanation is given of the girl's death?",
  "50656": "What was the dreadful thing I dreamed?",
  "50657": "But what shall we reply to the medals, undoubtedly genuine, which reckon the fifth year of his tribunitian power?",
  "50658": "Have we either of us ever rubbed thumbs over honestly gained farthings?",
  "50659": "Ah, you are the young woman come to look after my birds?",
  "50660": "Why could not I, going up to bed with my basket of keys, stop to sit down by her fire and accommodate myself for a little while to her, at least as well as to anybody else, and not trouble myself about the harmless things she said to me?",
  "50661": "In order, perhaps, to give countenance to the objection at any rate, it may be asked, is there not danger of an opposite bias in the national government, which may dispose it to endeavor to secure a monopoly of the federal administration to the landed class?",
  "50662": "How can we help it?",
  "50663": "Why do you ask such a question, I said, when you ought rather to be answering?",
  "50664": "Would you say six or four years?",
  "50665": "Would you shoot a poor, defenceless girl?",
  "50666": "Now, are you ready?",
  "50667": "Can you write shorthand?",
  "50668": "Yes, why did I not steal?",
  "50669": "Will you say it is because the body is the medium of suffering in this life?",
  "50670": "Now you will be able to go home and tell your friends that you have personally seen and heard the southern lights, for I suppose you have no doubt that you have really done so?",
  "50671": "You are of my opinion?",
  "50672": "Could it be possible that the squire was going to make a fool of himself and get married?",
  "50673": "But you will?",
  "50674": "How much is it?",
  "50675": "You will permit me to consider him an invalid?",
  "50676": "Where is he concealed?",
  "50677": "But was it his fault?",
  "50678": "You spoke to my coachman, then?",
  "50679": "Was the photograph a cabinet?",
  "50680": "Who's go dar?",
  "50681": "For the commission, is it not my whole future?",
  "50682": "Why all this excitement?",
  "50683": "Do you know the numbers?",
  "50684": "Why then should he repine when the hour of separation arrives?",
  "50685": "She had no reason for walking elsewhere, and why should she not go that way?",
  "50686": "Where is the knave?",
  "50687": "Any news, father?",
  "50688": "When did you see him last?",
  "50689": "Why, pray, did he add the old day?",
  "50690": "You think he went off just by chance?",
  "50691": "Is the cause of my soreness such a mystery that there's any need to tell me I am sore everywhere the staff hit me?",
  "50692": "What be these two, signior?",
  "50693": "Can anyone here play the drum?",
  "50694": "Shall you like to have such a brother?",
  "50695": "And what is better than woman?",
  "50696": "Ye much hurt?",
  "50697": "How shall I ever look this man in the face again?",
  "50698": "You think there may be fighting?",
  "50699": "Could it be that by some neglect in the preparations, the substitution perhaps of the wrong brandy, the astralization could not be effected?",
  "50700": "Was this to her doom after all?",
  "50701": "How agreed?",
  "50702": "And those papers?",
  "50703": "How is the gentleman called?",
  "50704": "What do you mean, you minx?",
  "50705": "Amontillado ?",
  "50706": "A coffin?",
  "50707": "Does it suggest anything to your mind?",
  "50708": "Could I forget that last autumn at this same day of the month and at this same place you lighted exactly such a fire as a signal for me to come and see you?",
  "50709": "You are certain?",
  "50710": "Why, did you not hear all we said?",
  "50711": "How, how?",
  "50712": "Then it is my place to ask you what you are going to do about it?",
  "50713": "Why are you up so early, my dear?",
  "50714": "Who will tell her?",
  "50715": "Guilty, of course?",
  "50716": "Do you laugh, you unfeeling brute, as if you enjoyed my distress?",
  "50717": "What enjoyment is there in making love to a woman who belongs to nobody and yet belongs to any one?",
  "50718": "Two drunken men, eh?",
  "50719": "What need they torture their heads with that which others have taken so strictly and so unalterably into their own purveying?",
  "50720": "What can be more natural and characteristic?",
  "50721": "Is there anything particular?",
  "50722": "What are you upset about?",
  "50723": "But the bogus inspector?",
  "50724": "And where are the children?",
  "50725": "There are then people who inhabit it?",
  "50726": "Her happiness?",
  "50727": "Please, ma'am, could I inquire if this highly instructive and charming institution is a new one?",
  "50728": "Is it not conceivable, at least, that obedience to an unselfish impulse may result even in the sacrifice of the opportunities of moral culture in general?",
  "50729": "But why not?",
  "50730": "How would they address us?",
  "50731": "Is there any thing new in this doctrine?",
  "50732": "What was she to say to him?",
  "50733": "You doubt it then?",
  "50734": "What sense is there in murdering a man in order to define one's relation to a guilty wife and son?",
  "50735": "Then this new kind of knowledge must have an additional quality?",
  "50736": "They taught you that?",
  "50737": "But you, critic, the reader undoubtedly will ask, what is your solution?",
  "50738": "But the heat developed by the rapidity of the projectile in crossing the strata of air?",
  "50739": "Well, are you trying to make out that I've said you have?",
  "50740": "Three days ago?",
  "50741": "What is it, a man?",
  "50742": "Whom do you think that is to?",
  "50743": "The lighted window, right up there?",
  "50744": "But if I lose?",
  "50745": "There, who are you?",
  "50746": "Or, perhaps, you may have the precious object she wants in your collection?",
  "50747": "Who do you think should be sent there?",
  "50748": "And what for?",
  "50749": "Should he place his catastrophe as a third associate in their felicity?",
  "50750": "Can you speak, lady?",
  "50751": "Do what?",
  "50752": "That so?",
  "50753": "And you followed the business of a tailor?",
  "50754": "But how did you gain them?",
  "50755": "Whither should they go, and where should be the new seat of the mission?",
  "50756": "How does his apoplex?",
  "50757": "Ca vous amuse, la vie?",
  "50758": "You would throw over one that has stood by you this five years in favour of a man that you never saw before in your life?",
  "50759": "What can be keeping him?",
  "50760": "Why do you laugh, sir?",
  "50761": "Should she speak to her?",
  "50762": "Should she open the door or should she not?",
  "50763": "Now, while you have tyranny in so great a degree walled in, and see your enemies over your heads, to what purpose is it to take counsel?",
  "50764": "You do not know that you love me?",
  "50765": "What in thunder has that to do with you?",
  "50766": "No one at home?",
  "50767": "How is it over?",
  "50768": "Is it business?",
  "50769": "What's a ball through the chest?",
  "50770": "Has he found time to tell you scandal about me?",
  "50771": "Well how can I help it?",
  "50772": "What has our providential rescue to do with altering your feelings toward me?",
  "50773": "Where is it now, the glory and the dream?",
  "50774": "When is one pleasure twice as great as another?",
  "50775": "Is marriage so demoralising as that?",
  "50776": "Did he take any luggage?",
  "50777": "Seeing the old man?",
  "50778": "Was it the effect of the balmy climate alone which recalled him to health?",
  "50779": "Were you speaking of me?",
  "50780": "An emancipator?",
  "50781": "Who is the agent?",
  "50782": "What tilbury?",
  "50783": "How can we ever thank you?",
  "50784": "Is it probable?",
  "50785": "Kitchens?",
  "50786": "And then should not the charity be all the more profound, in proportion as the fall is great?",
  "50787": "How was he to get through his present difficulty?",
  "50788": "What have you to say?",
  "50789": "You know?",
  "50790": "Is there any place at liberty that you know of now, uncle, that I should do for?",
  "50791": "But, why should I conceal my sentiments?",
  "50792": "Their graces?",
  "50793": "Shall I call him?",
  "50794": "How and why could it be mistaken?",
  "50795": "What the devil do you mean by this?",
  "50796": "Well, mon cher, have you got the manifesto?",
  "50797": "How, you are going soon?",
  "50798": "So saying, he fixed his eyes upon me, and asked if I had seen him tremble?",
  "50799": "But the man who was under him?",
  "50800": "Did he still cherish hope?",
  "50801": "Why funny?",
  "50802": "What have I done?",
  "50803": "Are you quite ready, gentlemen?",
  "50804": "To get what's left me sold by auction?",
  "50805": "What is to be done in these circumstances?",
  "50806": "Could he be sure that he was not their accomplice?",
  "50807": "Did the people shout at all?",
  "50808": "Excuse me,' and you believe that is sufficient?",
  "50809": "Perhaps you'd care to come in and have a drink on your way?",
  "50810": "Must I receive it, or leave it in the hands of the notary?",
  "50811": "What is the meaning of that?",
  "50812": "Oh, you know him?",
  "50813": "Sir, have you finished supper?",
  "50814": "What did I get by that?",
  "50815": "What has become of the faith which has hitherto carried you so bravely through all our difficulties?",
  "50816": "Then what will you have me say?",
  "50817": "Missus's?",
  "50818": "How, then, am I mad?",
  "50819": "Could you possibly wish for a more favorable conjunction of circumstances?",
  "50820": "What had been his object?",
  "50821": "And would that be all?",
  "50822": "Do you remember that after less than a year of married life you stood on the verge of an abyss?",
  "50823": "Why should I die, then, or basely despair?",
  "50824": "And anyone else?",
  "50825": "Do you never feel sick of it?",
  "50826": "Was this precaution or humility?",
  "50827": "Any men on it?",
  "50828": "Was it possible they heard not?",
  "50829": "Why do men halt between two opinions, and expect impossibilities?",
  "50830": "What are you wanting?",
  "50831": "Will not the good people respond to a united and earnest appeal from us?",
  "50832": "But why should I not receive her?",
  "50833": "But from whom is that letter?",
  "50834": "Have you them?",
  "50835": "What, gentlemen, is your verdict?",
  "50836": "What's a tall man unless he fight?",
  "50837": "Was there any other spirit but rum in the room?",
  "50838": "Do you wish to know clearly celestial matters, what they rightly are?",
  "50839": "Heavily?",
  "50840": "Do you want me to tear out my hair in handfuls?",
  "50841": "If the officer be accused of dishonesty, how shall it be made out?",
  "50842": "Where is the cure?",
  "50843": "Are you on the ground?",
  "50844": "You mentioned a fowl, I think?",
  "50845": "Upon what?",
  "50846": "Is not this an extraordinary tale?",
  "50847": "What are you meddling with my deeds for?",
  "50848": "Who is it, then, that you want to see?",
  "50849": "Is it to be yes at last?",
  "50850": "What made you think she would be here?",
  "50851": "WHO is in the room?",
  "50852": "What was there to be seen there?",
  "50853": "Was there left now nothing but to break off from the happy creative being, was the time up?",
  "50854": "You are not going out, uncle?",
  "50855": "Why should I be ashamed of myself?",
  "50856": "And there are four of you?",
  "50857": "How will it do, how will it do?",
  "50858": "Did you see the libraries and schools!?",
  "50859": "I should like to know whether you have the same notion which I have of this study?",
  "50860": "Who is going to dress me?",
  "50861": "What is it you want to distract you?",
  "50862": "Whose beneficence was like his?",
  "50863": "Who taught her?",
  "50864": "It was not he, then, you came to seek?",
  "50865": "Who'll have her?",
  "50866": "Did you speak to him?",
  "50867": "Have you seen fifty frightful men pass down from the cliffs into this forest, my children?",
  "50868": "Will your ladyship stay the night?",
  "50869": "What can he be picking up?",
  "50870": "How could this be, sir?",
  "50871": "What is the day of the month?",
  "50872": "What shall become of me?",
  "50873": "Well, have you made up your mind to this journey?",
  "50874": "And him you found?",
  "50875": "Did he get his brain fever, and then write all those terrible things, or had he some cause for it all?",
  "50876": "Cosette?",
  "50877": "Have you seen?",
  "50878": "Where shall we go?",
  "50879": "Or what is this?",
  "50880": "Have you seen the general?",
  "50881": "But how should they know when the projectile had reached this neutral point situated at that distance, especially when neither themselves, nor the objects enclosed in the projectile, would be any longer subject to the laws of weight?",
  "50882": "What have you been doing during my absence?",
  "50883": "But can the musician by his art make men unmusical?",
  "50884": "Yet, when the sensibility is thus increased at the expense of reason, and even the imagination, why do philosophical men complain of their fickleness?",
  "50885": "Am I to suppose that you intend to lower yourself by marrying a young woman who cannot possibly have enjoyed any of the advantages of a lady's education?",
  "50886": "Well, and your guardian must be brave if he is to fight well?",
  "50887": "Has my girl any objection?",
  "50888": "Now, when the restriction is removed, what is to prevent it from going still farther?",
  "50889": "But, I say, do you make any progress in it?",
  "50890": "But who should less expect from you?",
  "50891": "I would have you consider seriously of it?",
  "50892": "Were they asleep?",
  "50893": "Yet if he is not the maker, what is he in relation to the bed?",
  "50894": "Of complexion and brown hair?",
  "50895": "Have they contributed to encourage the diligence, and to improve the abilities, of the teachers?",
  "50896": "What about marriage?",
  "50897": "My friend, whom, then, will you serve?",
  "50898": "How is it that justice and isolation always accompany each other?",
  "50899": "And how is it to be parried?",
  "50900": "The rabbit?",
  "50901": "What could he have wanted there?",
  "50902": "Rob?",
  "50903": "So there is a hole?",
  "50904": "Why pay rent?",
  "50905": "Should he try to catch her eye, and then raise his hat?",
  "50906": "The first question is, whether music is or is not to make a part of education?",
  "50907": "Will you do me the favor to explain this enigma to me?",
  "50908": "Is there any other point which you would like to ask about?",
  "50909": "The bed might have been let down by some artificial means?",
  "50910": "But what are you up to?",
  "50911": "But what about you, and the rowing?",
  "50912": "May I have a grill for dinner?",
  "50913": "What need he add to such a desperate proof in figures?",
  "50914": "Did you promise to marry her?",
  "50915": "Did you speculate any more?",
  "50916": "What, let me ask, is a man in and of himself?",
  "50917": "Why so much beating about the bush?",
  "50918": "Or am I not to know?",
  "50919": "What does your chamber open on?",
  "50920": "Come to where four roads meet?",
  "50921": "What's this round your neck?",
  "50922": "And which?",
  "50923": "Why do you want to do that at this particular time, when at every previous time that I have proposed it you have refused?",
  "50924": "What gallows?",
  "50925": "Do you think you can help me, dear grandpapa?",
  "50926": "O why was that so?",
  "50927": "You know what they say of my lodger?",
  "50928": "But if he gives you?",
  "50929": "What money is this?",
  "50930": "And would it be indiscreet to ask you the name of this powerful protector?",
  "50931": "I beg your pardon?",
  "50932": "What do you call liberty, monsieur?",
  "50933": "You notice my ring?",
  "50934": "What revenge?",
  "50935": "What say ye?",
  "50936": "Is it all right in the new way?",
  "50937": "Why does he then exceed all bounds at once?",
  "50938": "How are you sure?",
  "50939": "Does any one live, who knows what set purposes you have, half as well as I do?",
  "50940": "Could it be that these were four words, and that they were intended to carry a message to me?",
  "50941": "Will you let me make the tea?",
  "50942": "What else did he say to you?",
  "50943": "What is there in all that for me to think about?",
  "50944": "By pulling out a bar and pushing down a door?",
  "50945": "Aye?",
  "50946": "Well, miss?",
  "50947": "But what was to be done?",
  "50948": "Was the projectile under some foreign influence?",
  "50949": "Will you begin, if you please, and put in the thatch again, just as if you were doing it for your mother's cabin?",
  "50950": "Shall we not set forth?",
  "50951": "Do you, sir?",
  "50952": "Do you think this does?",
  "50953": "Do you think you could hustle something in the way of a little lunch, old man?",
  "50954": "What could this NN be?",
  "50955": "And how did he behave, madam?",
  "50956": "How much do you require for my ransom?",
  "50957": "If the possibility of passing the limits of experience be admitted, by means of the dynamical law of the relation of an effect to its cause, what kind of conception shall we obtain by this procedure?",
  "50958": "But are your relatives so very poor?",
  "50959": "What is all this dancing up and down?",
  "50960": "If all were only vanity, who would mind it?",
  "50961": "But will his warriors consent?",
  "50962": "Why then should you expect me to pen this kind of affidavit, which has no object but to keep up a foolish partiality and secure a foolish bequest?",
  "50963": "But how did you proceed?",
  "50964": "What was it placed there for?",
  "50965": "Are YOU there?",
  "50966": "Or perhaps it is the pale morning light which takes your colour away?",
  "50967": "Why did you not bring it at once?",
  "50968": "The messenger that brought it, said would you be so good as read it by my lantern?",
  "50969": "If anyone arrives in my absence, do the honors for me, will you not?",
  "50970": "Has the breakfast been all right?",
  "50971": "Of what day?",
  "50972": "I trust you are in good health, and that your families are all well?",
  "50973": "Was it the fall of some mighty pillar of the globe?",
  "50974": "Well, what now?",
  "50975": "Think?",
  "50976": "And the youth repented, and became a good man?",
  "50977": "He rends defenseless women and little children in his lair, but how recently has one of you seen him fight with men?",
  "50978": "Pray, what may that portmanteau of yours weigh?",
  "50979": "You'll be sure to be stirring early and go with us?",
  "50980": "Will it be possible to draw water here tonight?",
  "50981": "Are any of the gallants within?",
  "50982": "Well, then, what do you make of your word AUSTRA?",
  "50983": "Where does the fun come in?",
  "50984": "Why not defend ourselves?",
  "50985": "Is the atmospheric condition, having once reached this density, to become final?",
  "50986": "Could they go to the corral in this dark night?",
  "50987": "Should he treat it as belonging to him?",
  "50988": "Will he succeed in his purpose?",
  "50989": "Oh, how could you act so?",
  "50990": "And yet, he said, the number two is certainly not opposed to the number three?",
  "50991": "No lands neither?",
  "50992": "What were horses made for, if not to drag people uphill?",
  "50993": "In which of your characters, sir, will you give us leave to address you?",
  "50994": "Why have you thrown that away?",
  "50995": "Dead?",
  "50996": "Will you never correct yourself of that vile habit?",
  "50997": "And what did you think, sir, of what I said?",
  "50998": "What, then, it may be asked, is the good of being great?",
  "50999": "Is it not clear that your duty is to oppose the former to the latter, and thus, by the argument of contradiction, drive privilege into its last ditch?",
  "51000": "I wonder which craft I shall get?",
  "51001": "You promise?",
  "51002": "Not so much as out of bed?",
  "51003": "What's the good of tormenting him like this?",
  "51004": "What do you think of that?",
  "51005": "Can you not do anything you wish?",
  "51006": "But how were you to benefit?",
  "51007": "Rinaldo, why still so pensive?",
  "51008": "What can I do for you?",
  "51009": "What have I done to need his forgiveness?",
  "51010": "And whom I so dearly love?",
  "51011": "Only compatible with letting ME, you mean?",
  "51012": "If so, is he mad?",
  "51013": "Do we eulogize the man who first perceives the dawn?",
  "51014": "Is she one of the performers?",
  "51015": "What rights does your majesty attach to this office of intendant?",
  "51016": "Money, I presume?",
  "51017": "In your arms?",
  "51018": "Pray to what is this attributable?",
  "51019": "How can it be otherwise with me?",
  "51020": "Peace?",
  "51021": "What work are you about now?",
  "51022": "Would not his hearers add to that sum?",
  "51023": "But passion for him?",
  "51024": "Who is he?",
  "51025": "Does your feminine tyranny require that when you say the thing you mean is one of several things, I should know it immediately by that mark?",
  "51026": "In what condition of mind were you?",
  "51027": "Is it like that, dad?",
  "51028": "And how the devil did you come to fasten me out, you toothless hound?",
  "51029": "Spell it?",
  "51030": "How did I give it?",
  "51031": "Where can I turn?",
  "51032": "We are blocked up then?",
  "51033": "The question in such cases is, whose is the heavier punishment, hers or his?",
  "51034": "And where are the rest of his banditti?",
  "51035": "What is the nature of the impediment?",
  "51036": "Oh, the admirable police have found that out, have they?",
  "51037": "What are they, he said, and where shall I find them?",
  "51038": "Where is it?",
  "51039": "But what is the use?",
  "51040": "Which way lies their path?",
  "51041": "I've convinced you it's impossible?",
  "51042": "Is it to lead us prisoners to the woods, or do you contemplate even some greater evil?",
  "51043": "Did not I work that waistcoat to make you genteel?",
  "51044": "And why is it impossible?",
  "51045": "What became of these men?",
  "51046": "Shall we shut the door, and lock it, or not?",
  "51047": "Why should you ever have been otherwise?",
  "51048": "When did you ever hear of me starving people into good behavior?",
  "51049": "It was you who sent for me?",
  "51050": "Is he going to deceive a SHIP CLERK?",
  "51051": "Has he any friends?",
  "51052": "Then can the convicts have been on board?",
  "51053": "Or that they were not the first statues?",
  "51054": "Rascal, what are you at there?",
  "51055": "Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?",
  "51056": "Who then is the monarch, or where is the monarchy?",
  "51057": "Gridley?",
  "51058": "And when she is undeceived?",
  "51059": "How so?",
  "51060": "Now, come and tell me whether the horns of your other knights of the bull's feather have such a virtue and wonderful propriety?",
  "51061": "Who dares maintain such a proposition?",
  "51062": "And would you care to view the remains?",
  "51063": "Do you smoke?",
  "51064": "Will you disgrace me thus?",
  "51065": "Be sure you sense what I say?",
  "51066": "Do you ever feel weary?",
  "51067": "Are you an orphan?",
  "51068": "Want any more?",
  "51069": "You have not observed anyone follow or watch you?",
  "51070": "How should I disengage myself?",
  "51071": "Reason?",
  "51072": "Went where?",
  "51073": "Want to see him?",
  "51074": "But how do you know you will get the money back?",
  "51075": "What does it say?",
  "51076": "Who was that with you?",
  "51077": "A propos, have you a good horse?",
  "51078": "Well, now, and the short and long of it, captain?",
  "51079": "Very well?",
  "51080": "When shall the worshipful esquire drink?",
  "51081": "What was it all about?",
  "51082": "What will the moral philosophers who appear at this time have to preach?",
  "51083": "Prussians in the cellar?",
  "51084": "But who made it so as there was no arbitratin', and no justice to be got?",
  "51085": "What have you in common with him?",
  "51086": "Can the mercy which they have exercised even in the fury of battle be extinct in their hearts?",
  "51087": "Now shall we go home?",
  "51088": "A scandal, is it not?",
  "51089": "Will you come?",

  "51139": "I believe it was settled you should meet me?",
  "51140": "Then, what clue could you have as to his identity?",
  "51141": "Any you will submit to the reparation he may require?",
  "51142": "Why did you signal to stop?",

  "51155": "To this I am willing, but is there none amongst us who has a better right?",
  "51156": "Then, what, sir, if I should convince you to your face of my sincerity?",
  "51157": "Why, what shall I learn?",
  "51158": "But what's to be done?",
  "51159": "Ah?",
  "51160": "And, to conclude the matter, what is even an eternal remembrance?",
  "51161": "Could I be mistaken?",
  "51162": "But why, sir?",
  "51163": "And what his cause of grief?",
  "51164": "Is it so?",
  "51165": "Why should you be thus scrupulous, pray you, sir?",
  "51166": "Then, sire, may I present him?",
  "51167": "Yes, giant's horses you must have, must you not?",
  "51168": "Have we come to any?",
  "51169": "What do you assure me?",

  "51172": "What is imagination?",
  "51173": "Nay, none?",
  "51174": "Where does the window of that look out to?",
  "51175": "And sack my stable?",
  "51176": "Could she still draw back after all he had done for her?",
  "51177": "Shall I complain of him?",
  "51178": "What in the name of the devil is this thing?",

  "51181": "Some THING or someone?",
  "51182": "D'you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled them ever since I was a nipper?",
  "51183": "Would they be able to find a place to land, or would they go hurtling down into some awful crater, or be dashed upon the sharp peak of some mountain of the moon?",
  "51184": "But what was his business?",
  "51185": "But knowing the scheme they had planned, why should he offer to assist it?",
  "51186": "Might it not have been a long time already on the coast of the island?",
  "51187": "May I make bold to trouble your honor?",
  "51188": "Vouchsafe me, by whom, good captain?",
  "51189": "You are detectives, I suppose?",
  "51190": "Well, do you recognize your little madcap playmate?",
  "51191": "May I go at once?",
  "51192": "You're still at the same work, then?",
  "51193": "Did he have fine horses?",
  "51194": "Why, gentlemen?",
  "51195": "Whatever I had to do, I always did it eagerly and with all my heart, did I not?",

  "51198": "You have found the castaway?",
  "51199": "Did he get all right?",
  "51200": "But how are you going to get it?",
  "51201": "How can I express it?",
  "51202": "Do you think my husband was too much inclined to welcome you?",
  "51203": "No bad thing, eh?",
  "51204": "This being so, how is it that, ever since the establishment of this balance, inequality has been on the increase?",

  "51206": "Do you suppose he can possibly recover?",
  "51207": "I wished to have, what?",
  "51208": "Nobody did?",
  "51209": "The crops?",
  "51210": "How should we meet discriminations on railways and in hotels?",
  "51211": "Something to drink?",
  "51212": "How old could she be?",
  "51213": "Who ever heard of such a thing?",
  "51214": "Is not my heart like a glass house, into which you can all look, to convince yourselves that it is a soil wholly unfruitful, and that not a single poor little flower grows there?",
  "51215": "But how do you come to be doing this?",
  "51216": "How about poison?",
  "51217": "Will they meet?",

  "51233": "How did you come by that?",
  "51234": "Am I to take from you then that you accept and recognise my knowledge?",
  "51235": "Does he mean, by this decoration, a figurative or a real golden chain?",
  "51236": "Will you follow the bearer, and see once again the outcast whom all the rest of the world will shun?",
  "51237": "Our great relation?",

  "51474": "Did she not always expect it?",
  "51475": "The husband?",
  "51476": "For the question still recurs, what motive first produces those instances of submission, which we imitate, and that train of actions, which produces the custom?",
  "51477": "Why did he ever forget it?",
  "51478": "How do you know what men would fall in love with?",
  "51479": "How do you know but that it hurts a geranium's feelings just to be called a geranium and nothing else?",
  "51480": "Did the person wish to smoke?",
  "51481": "Was it a bacchanalia?",
  "51482": "And what do you decide upon now, my lady?",
  "51483": "Well and when the money's gone, what then?",
  "51484": "Do you like that better?",
  "51485": "How did you get such huge huge hands?",
  "51486": "Who were the persons in whom he placed the greatest confidence, and who took the warmest interest in his schemes?",
  "51487": "I was going to say, the will to be interested in him has died, and what else matters?",
  "51488": "Are you satisfied now?",
  "51489": "My goodness, what utter twaddle, and what may all this nonsense have signified, pray?",
  "51490": "Of what must I repent?",
  "51491": "But of what use is it to fatigue myself with vain words?",
  "51492": "Then we may assume that our athletes will be able to fight with two or three times their own number?",
  "51493": "The philanthropist?",
  "51494": "Why, are they after him yet?",
  "51495": "And will he not, from his own interest in that species of property, be sufficiently prone to resist every attempt to prejudice or encumber it?",
  "51496": "Pet name props?",
  "51497": "And she kept her word?",
  "51498": "And what was the true measurement of the new little world?",
  "51499": "Why are they the happiest?",
  "51500": "Yes, my friend, but if so, when do we lose them?",
  "51501": "Can he not hold his water at reading of a ballad?",
  "51502": "I suppose you're very glad to go?",
  "51503": "What can he want with me?",
  "51504": "What have you been doing here?",
  "51505": "And if it departed how could it move unless it went upwards?",
  "51506": "What could he do else that would have been of the smallest use to her?",
  "51507": "But is there capital punishment where you were?",
  "51508": "Do we stop here?",
  "51509": "How many are they?",
  "51510": "Is it really?",
  "51511": "So that you were at rest?",
  "51512": "A little or much?",
  "51513": "Who then?",
  "51514": "Are you stupid?",
  "51515": "And what's your name?",
  "51516": "Did she die very soon?",
  "51517": "Do you want me to adjudicate that too?",
  "51518": "What is that to me?",
  "51519": "Perhaps you never before noticed him?",
  "51520": "Why is it, I say, that you are thus agitated in relation to the domestic affairs of other communities?",
  "51521": "How can you talk so?",
  "51522": "Who told you that they have never done so?",
  "51523": "Have you got a sledge?",
  "51524": "Police, sir?",
  "51525": "But come whither?",
  "51526": "Then I have received a merely legitimate salary, in spite of the opinion of my confessor?",
  "51527": "But where was the novelty?",
  "51528": "Where is your wife, in the first place?",
  "51529": "And where did the dream come from?",
  "51530": "And what shall I do if you desert me?",
  "51531": "How, nowhere?",
  "51532": "Do you know what we are eating here?",
  "51533": "Yes, but how much?",
  "51534": "Grow pale, fear, calculate?",
  "51535": "Go on the stage?",
  "51536": "Wood?",
  "51537": "What is the ego?",
  "51538": "And how much did she give you for this fine enterprise?",
  "51539": "Was there no means of calming this angry sea?",
  "51540": "What did he say to that?",
  "51541": "Do about you?",
  "51542": "What's the sense of it?",
  "51543": "Where is the guilty party here?",
  "51544": "And what happened to him afterwards?",
  "51545": "Is it a duty to postpone everything to a sense of injuries, and wrong to gratify a mother in a request like this?",
  "51546": "Anything else, my lord?",
  "51547": "Dear mother, are you so resolved?",
  "51548": "But she is proud, is she not?",
  "51549": "But what does the thermometer say?",
  "51550": "Can you ask that question?",
  "51551": "What's become of them, the dear fellows?",
  "51552": "Why are you travelling?",
  "51553": "How should they use it?",
  "51554": "Does he speak to you of this conspiracy?",
  "51555": "You left your door open?",
  "51556": "Is there danger of another?",
  "51557": "What had her infancy been?",
  "51558": "How much money have you left?",
  "51559": "But what were you going to say?",
  "51560": "She is no relation of his?",
  "51561": "What if she were so called?",
  "51562": "In other words, should strict impartiality be aimed at?",
  "51563": "And what did he offer?",
  "51564": "Why not go and try to get speech of him and beg for justice?",
  "51565": "What shall you do in life?",
  "51566": "Was not that nearly what you said?",
  "51567": "Is not this a free country?",
  "51568": "Which of these will be mine?",
  "51569": "How did you happen to be taken to a hospital?",
  "51570": "What is it?",
  "51571": "I brought it to the table near the fire, and asked him what he would have?",
  "51572": "Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind?",
  "51573": "Does this prove that ignorance and dependence domesticate them?",
  "51574": "Why do you not see this?",
  "51575": "What is it makes the wolves to leave the woods?",
  "51576": "It is useless?",
  "51577": "Mad, is he?",
  "51578": "Is it a pure a priori, or is it an empirical intuition?",
  "51579": "Why does it not encourage its citizens to put out its faults, and do better than it would have them?",
  "51580": "Have you told them where to find me?",
  "51581": "Where, then, is the ship?",
  "51582": "I'm not very exacting, am I?",
  "51583": "And in what state of mind has he returned to you?",
  "51584": "What was it that he did?",
  "51585": "Well, then, tell us frankly, what do you think of her personal appearance?",
  "51586": "Why, for example, should the king of a primitive community be prohibited from sleeping lying down?",
  "51587": "Where am I to join on?",
  "51588": "What right have you to bid me leave this house, sir?",
  "51589": "Who would endure this for many lives?",
  "51590": "Which is best off?",
  "51591": "Tell me, where is the place that men call hell?",
  "51592": "Then will she die too?",
  "51593": "Need it be said that no such measures could destroy that tendency?",
  "51594": "Well as he knew how to resolve characters into their elements, would he have been able to combine those elements in such a manner as to make up a man, a real, living, individual man?",
  "51595": "Od's precious, come away, man, what do you mean?",
  "51596": "May I go and help carry the things to the poor little children?",
  "51597": "Have heard them say that there is nothing pleasanter than to get rid of their pain?",
  "51598": "Who could see?",
  "51599": "Have you any more to stake?",
  "51600": "What shall you tell her?",
  "51601": "What like is he?",
  "51602": "Is this of envy or no?",
  "51603": "Why, WHY do they torment me and say I am going to marry you?",
  "51604": "If I went to sleep as I proposed, how could the atmosphere in the chamber be regenerated in the interim?",
  "51605": "I suppose you have searched her desk and things?",
  "51606": "What, after all, was this new oath?",
  "51607": "What then are we to conclude from these facts and considerations?",
  "51608": "How might it fare more gently with you in all the world?",
  "51609": "What avarice?",
  "51610": "Hurt me?",
  "51611": "Who's not playing fair?",
  "51612": "They were none of them among our friends at the lodge, then?",
  "51613": "Has it been so kept?",
  "51614": "So you are going away in the fall?",
  "51615": "In the flesh?",
  "51616": "Where is my wife?",
  "51617": "And had he married the valiant matron's daughter, as he promised?",
  "51618": "Whatcher take me for, hey?",
  "51619": "What do you mean, the rabbit?",
  "51620": "Now what do you say?",
  "51621": "And what sort of men do they graduate?",
  "51622": "He knew then?",
  "51623": "What was she insolent about?",
  "51624": "Do you not see his heart is fast breaking?",
  "51625": "Can this be possible, uncle?",
  "51626": "Why should they?",
  "51627": "Have you forgotten the day?",
  "51628": "Do you see anything there?",
  "51629": "What is the object of this assembly?",
  "51630": "Good heavens, are you ill?",
  "51631": "Well, did you dig up the watch?",
  "51632": "You will arrest him?",
  "51633": "What uncanny secret did it hold?",
  "51634": "Why is she thus possessed, and why does she not spare herself?",
  "51635": "At any rate, you have some walks in the neighbourhood?",
  "51636": "You have been a soldier?",
  "51637": "But why a year?",
  "51638": "Where, then, would have been her navy, her trade and even her existence?",
  "51639": "What do you hear from your mother?",
  "51640": "How could I settle the point forever?",
  "51641": "What does that spell?",
  "51642": "He means to marry you?",
  "51643": "But would that be necessary?",
  "51644": "What did happen?",
  "51645": "Is the shepherd said to be just to his sheep and his dogs?",
  "51646": "Why do you keep the secrets of that man, when they mean death to so many?",
  "51647": "But if I pursue and nothing gain, what will it profit me to come up with him?",
  "51648": "Do you wish to get out?",
  "51649": "Clara, are you ready to come home?",
  "51650": "Did you ever hear of such ingratitude?",
  "51651": "The best school?",
  "51652": "Bread?",
  "51653": "Dare they to hope a poet for their friend?",
  "51654": "What has made you so disobedient and unfaithful?",
  "51655": "You're not in bed?",
  "51656": "What spot?",
  "51657": "What would become of this assertion, if, assuming in my turn the offensive, I should demonstrate that belief in the existence of bodies, or, in other words, in the reality of a purely corporeal nature, is untenable?",
  "51658": "Did he believe?",
  "51659": "Could he forego the renown of being the first wit of his age?",
  "51660": "What was he hoping for?",
  "51661": "Elm or fir, both of which abounded in the island?",
  "51662": "And why will they not?",
  "51663": "What if you should die first?",
  "51664": "As day by day the sun sank lower and lower in the sky, could he be certain that the luminary would ever retrace his heavenly road?",
  "51665": "Had they nothing else to say to one another?",
  "51666": "Did I not tell you how quick and resolute she was?",
  "51667": "Is there any example of an individual object that escaped the government of that law in the whole history of the world?",
  "51668": "Why tarry ye?",
  "51669": "Did he give a reason?",
  "51670": "How did you come here?",
  "51671": "Did I break through one of your rings, that you spread that damned ice on the causeway?",
  "51672": "He asked himself, or were they playing a part?",
  "51673": "Is it true that my mind is only a harmony, and my soul a vortex?",
  "51674": "But if I do fight, you will surely not object to giving me a lesson or two in shooting and fencing?",
  "51675": "Are we women?",
  "51676": "Have you more to say?",
  "51677": "What had really happened?",
  "51678": "For what is there more prompt, more unexpected, more abbreviatory of space and time, than the maturity of an obligation?",
  "51679": "Would they be right in the future?",
  "51680": "And what do you say is your surmise as to your present position?",
  "51681": "Suppose now I ask, why I rather than anybody else?",
  "51682": "If what?",
  "51683": "Have you a heart?",
  "51684": "With me?",
  "51685": "Did you ever hear of such an idea?",
  "51686": "Have you quite forgotten her?",
  "51687": "So you are good enough to pass my appearance?",
  "51688": "Is it tobacco?",
  "51689": "I ask you what can I do?",
  "51690": "Could it have been an early hornet?",
  "51691": "Why not pursue an end confessedly good by peaceable and regular means?",
  "51692": "Did he come to arrest me?",
  "51693": "Whither so fast, child?",
  "51694": "Ah, why will you not unseal my lips?",
  "51695": "Does this look like confidence?",
  "51696": "Has it gone well?",
  "51697": "Admires the jay the insect's gilded wings?",
  "51698": "And did they often get a chance to do that?",
  "51699": "And do I love?",
  "51700": "UNDER THE CROSS,' hey?",
  "51701": "What did you look at, so fixedly?",
  "51702": "Why stop?",
  "51703": "And of what are you so sure?",
  "51704": "And the friend he regards and describes as one in whom he has an interest, and the other as a stranger in whom he has no interest?",
  "51705": "For all that, are not our dresses as beautiful as yours?",
  "51706": "Why are they fighting?",
  "51707": "Is the danger you apprehended last night gone by now, sir?",
  "51708": "When the winds blow and the seas flow?",
  "51709": "Do you call this acting the part of a man and a gentleman, sir?",
  "51710": "Why should not I eat birds?",
  "51711": "A slap in the face?",
  "51712": "What have you to do with our independence?",
  "51713": "What principle directed it?",
  "51714": "Besides, why should I say anything about it to him?",
  "51715": "How did you get this passport?",
  "51716": "The house is sold, then?",
  "51717": "What kind of person is she?",
  "51718": "Did he hear me?",
  "51719": "You were his constant companion, then?",
  "51720": "Is it not rather an appeal to the proprietory instinct, the COMMERCIAL instinct?",
  "51721": "Is that true, mother?",
  "51722": "How once?",
  "51723": "When an establishment has had the leisure to develop itself, enlarge its foundations, ballast itself with capital, and assure itself a body of patrons, what can the workman who has only his arms do against a power so superior?",
  "51724": "Well, and what does it signify whether it was he or I?",
  "51725": "What formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward?",
  "51726": "Would it be believed, that when near nineteen, any one could be so stupid as to build his hopes of future subsistence on an empty phial?",
  "51727": "Is not this absurd?",
  "51728": "Do you know that I am to be beheaded outside this window?",
  "51729": "Eh, who's there?",
  "51730": "How many a year, did you say?",
  "51731": "You intend to show off your intelligence, I suppose?",
  "51732": "Did you want me?",
  "51733": "What are you talking about, man?",
  "51734": "Is it possible that even now, when I give you these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?",
  "51735": "But where were you going, when you met us?",
  "51736": "I wonder where I shall be this time tomorrow?",
  "51737": "Taenarum?",
  "51738": "Cannot you understand that the time it takes to wink is a whole eternity if it severs me from the beauty of your face?",
  "51739": "Tomorrow, then, sire?",
  "51740": "And who are you?",
  "51741": "What did ye?",
  "51742": "How long would it last?",
  "51743": "Who is still to come?",
  "51744": "Should he abandon this man?",
  "51745": "How about the others?",
  "51746": "Has he brought his brig with him?",
  "51747": "And what are my instructions?",
  "51748": "To make that reply and then perish, what could be grander?",
  "51749": "Why do I?",
  "51750": "Where are we living?",
  "51751": "Would you like me to come with you now?",
  "51752": "Can you already understand?",
  "51753": "Were they in the front or in the rear of their generation?",
  "51754": "How could I be otherwise?",
  "51755": "On the contrary, but what dignity?",
  "51756": "Just now, but refrained out of politeness ?",
  "51757": "Are you trying to hide?",
  "51758": "Is the vicar in?",
  "51759": "How can you say such a thing?",
  "51760": "A secret?",
  "51761": "Did you want the carpenter, sir?",
  "51762": "Then why are you always alone in your room these days?",
  "51763": "Got shot?",
  "51764": "Who makes the waters flow?",
  "51765": "More money, I suppose?",
  "51766": "About you?",
  "51767": "You will be staying on here, I suppose?",
  "51768": "It is you who set out seven or eight months ago from your country to seek your fortune in the capital?",
  "51769": "Where's your uncle?",
  "51770": "Who in the world cares for YOU?",
  "51771": "Was it real, or only apparent?",
  "51772": "What is the difficulty?",
  "51773": "WHAT doth all the world know at present?",
  "51774": "Is there no ford?",
  "51775": "How came it to pass?",
  "51776": "Are you willing?",
  "51777": "Done with their buttons?",
  "51778": "Av you anything to say agen it?",
  "51779": "Could it have been a slight quivering of the nostrils that he had seen, or was it mad fancy playing a trick on him?",
  "51780": "Would it comfort, or would it wound you to have a similar painting?",
  "51781": "Who is in command here?",
  "51782": "Will you let me see you home?",
  "51783": "Will you take charge of the letter?",
  "51784": "Should not all that be eternal?",
  "51785": "But why prove that to me?",
  "51786": "And its aim is?",
  "51787": "What could be the meaning of such a change?",
  "51788": "Have there been any fresh developments?",
  "51789": "What are you about?",
  "51790": "What joy would they have to bring hanging to the likes of me?",
  "51791": "Where did she go?",
  "51792": "But may I, mamma?",
  "51793": "And who are hearsed that die on the sea?",
  "51794": "How have you got here?",
  "51795": "How long has he left it?",
  "51796": "And whither am I to go?",
  "51797": "Now, from whom could these pages come?",
  "51798": "You will then be at my service?",
  "51799": "And pray, sir, what in the world is equal to it?",
  "51800": "Could it be that there should be happiness in store for her?",
  "51801": "And what would that be, think you?",
  "51802": "Where is my hat?",
  "51803": "Yet could I, in justice, or even in possibility, refuse this demand?",
  "51804": "What is the meaning of this?",
  "51805": "Will your majesty permit me to tell you the truth?",
  "51806": "Whatever can be the matter?",
  "51807": "Had the cooling of the globe produced it?",
  "51808": "Are you and your party ready?",
  "51809": "Doubt?",
  "51810": "To whom do I surrender?",
  "51811": "Well, are you off to the front?",
  "51812": "Oh, is that so?",
  "51813": "He asked me if I felt sure that I was as well as in the morning?",
  "51814": "Please will your grandfather lend us his fuelhouse to try over our parts in, tonight at seven o'clock?",
  "51815": "Well, what is it perplexes me?",
  "51816": "Is your honour mad?",
  "51817": "This dial with movable needle is a manometer, is it not?",
  "51818": "How could these men, who never had the faintest idea of statistics, valuation, or political economy, furnish us with principles of legislation?",
  "51819": "And how's it you're not afraid, sir, really now?",
  "51820": "This?",
  "51821": "Have you been in it since your adventure?",
  "51822": "Wife with you?",
  "51823": "Why do you keep looking at me like that?",
  "51824": "Did he reject her eternally, or did he not?",
  "51825": "Will you not honor us by telling us who you are?",
  "51826": "Whom have you come from?",
  "51827": "How much brandy may I drink?",
  "51828": "But what does it matter, now it's all over?",
  "51829": "Who will bring up my children?",
  "51830": "But why should we wish to escape?",
  "51831": "Tell her?",
  "51832": "Has he no father or mother, or uncles or aunts?",
  "51833": "Interested, are you?",
  "51834": "If I'm as good as good can be all day tomorrow will you let me be just as bad as I like all the next day?",

  "51842": "Had he seen his father?",
  "51843": "Whom do you bring?",
  "51844": "What does it matter about the trumpery cheque?",
  "51845": "But how could I live up to it?",
  "51846": "But when I assure you that you may rely on my tenderness?",
  "51847": "And what would be the use if she were?",
  "51848": "Have there, indeed, now?",
  "51849": "For whom are you looking, my fine fellow?",
  "51850": "Why did men come to that once forbidding land ?",
  "51851": "What are you thinking of this evening?",
  "51852": "And do you now intend, on this account, to deny the debt?",
  "51853": "Are fathers unnatural, and children prodigal?",
  "51854": "Where shall I find a refuge?",
  "51855": "Who would live amidst perpetual wrangling, and scolding, and mutual reproaches?",
  "51856": "Say?",
  "51857": "For how can the tears of my neighbour benefit me?",
  "51858": "Oh, where are you going, my lord?",
  "51859": "The officer of the guard, then, with his chessboard?",
  "51860": "Is it not then reasonable to infer that, if he had really been guilty of forming a base conspiracy against the fame and fortunes of a rival, he would have expressed some remorse for so serious a crime?",
  "51861": "Do you think the experiment will work?",
  "51862": "What is wrong?",
  "51863": "And can you send me to the station this afternoon?",
  "51864": "And have these pets got anything on THEIR minds, eh?",
  "51865": "Had you any emeralds?",
  "51866": "At what o'clock was it raised?",
  "51867": "All of them?",

  "53403": "Were they normal?",
  "53404": "Do you understand, damn you?",
  "53405": "Do you carry it about with you always?",
  "53406": "To warn her?",
  "53407": "How can I?",
  "53408": "That's it, is it?",
  "53409": "You hate mankind?",
  "53410": "But will it do you any more good to devour it with your eyes than with your teeth?",
  "53411": "Thinner?",
  "53412": "But what is the reckoning?",
  "53413": "Was he not fallen himself?",
  "53414": "But are you sure of having exhausted all other ways?",
  "53415": "But the queen?",
  "53416": "May I ask to what these questions tend?",
  "53417": "Paul?",
  "53418": "Is she valiant?",
  "53419": "Is this the dog goes with you?",
  "53420": "Was not the door closed?",
  "53421": "Why should one death be great, while our sacrifice is horrible?",
  "53422": "What food do you eat?",
  "53423": "Will your worship read it to me, noble sir?",
  "53424": "Where did the blood come from?",
  "53425": "Pretty smooth?",
  "53426": "By doing what clever trick?",
  "53427": "Is the deed of sale ready?",
  "53428": "Are we lost?",
  "53429": "A murder?",
  "53430": "Of what, then, does humanity repent?",
  "53431": "Or if honour or victory or courage, in that case the judgement of the ambitious or pugnacious would be the truest?",
  "53432": "When, where, how?",
  "53433": "What can mine own praise to mine own self bring?",
  "53434": "How could they be cordial with their sore consciences and shamed faces?",
  "53435": "Sith passed pleasures double but new woe?",
  "53436": "For you have neither relatives nor acquaintances whom you need fear to offend by living with me?",
  "53437": "How can ships sail this way and that?",
  "53438": "The stock is in your own hands?",
  "53439": "Is the danger apprehended from the other branches of the federal government?",
  "53440": "Who says it?",
  "53441": "What is going on, my lord?",
  "53442": "What can I want?",
  "53443": "His former love?",
  "53444": "Do you need help?",
  "53445": "Is he infirm?",
  "53446": "Jumped out of window?",
  "53447": "Why not simply issue a general order that you intend to do this?",
  "53448": "Do you like him?",
  "53449": "And the remorse of an adoring husband?",
  "53450": "Did you ever know him to cut himself in shaving before?",
  "53451": "What shall you do after tonight?",
  "53452": "How came you to see her?",
  "53453": "Can he endure no noise, and will venture on a wife?",
  "53454": "Why enlist?",
  "53455": "But, so far as you can ascertain, he did not take it?",
  "53456": "Who is in the room besides you?",
  "53457": "What about him?",
  "53458": "Why are you standing up?",
  "53459": "Going to the raffle as well as ourselves?",
  "53460": "I wonder, is it not too late to administer unction?",
  "53461": "If we possess this force and our allies or partners do not, how do we fight together?",
  "53462": "Are the rules the same?",
  "53463": "And how many sheep?",
  "53464": "The surprise?",
  "53465": "Is my lord dead?",
  "53466": "You know her, it seems?",
  "53467": "My enemy, say you?",
  "53468": "Who made them enemies?",
  "53469": "So you mean to strap them instead?",
  "53470": "What on earth does she mean?",
  "53471": "If you are suspected, you shall give the alarm?",
  "53472": "How are you going to keep the game up?",
  "53473": "Why will the seamen always become morbid when possible?",
  "53474": "Do you want to go anywhere?",
  "53475": "Well, a great deal must have soaked through, must it not?",
  "53476": "Is that the sort of thing you tell them at your hospital?",
  "53477": "Now what is decay?",
  "53478": "What advantage should I have over you, if knowing your secret I were to tell you mine?",
  "53479": "What were you trying to do with all your signs?",
  "53480": "Are we to take him up to her?",
  "53481": "What will she do?",
  "53482": "What do you talk so for?",
  "53483": "That who was here?",
  "53484": "Where could I get a drink?",
  "53485": "What shall we learn from THAT stuff?",
  "53486": "And where is my wife?",
  "53487": "Well, then, you made the boating man believe that he was the father, did you not?",
  "53488": "If society is binding on the boat, is it also binding on the provisions?",
  "53489": "But tell me, do you think I am so beautiful?",
  "53490": "What finer retinue could be expected for his funeral?",
  "53491": "And is it not the very diagnostic of true salvation that it shall overcome the fear of death?",
  "53492": "You do not mean to ride, gentlemen?",
  "53493": "You understand how those things are managed?",
  "53494": "But what would become of this human imago in a state of perfect bliss?",
  "53495": "What are all systems, religious, political, or scientific, but opinions resting on evidence more or less satisfactory?",
  "53496": "Perhaps that you're searching far too much?",
  "53497": "And do you know whither he went?",
  "53498": "Did some marine monster come from time to time, to breathe at the bottom of this well?",
  "53499": "Then, of course, you can read and write quite correctly?",
  "53500": "Have we any of us any friends there?",
  "53501": "Then I shall be of no use to your majesty?",
  "53502": "When men are sore with the sense of oppressions, and menaced with the prospects of new ones, is the calmness of philosophy or the palsy of insensibility to be looked for?",
  "53503": "What did I care about paradise?",
  "53504": "And now how was I to proceed to reconstruct this midnight drama?",
  "53505": "Shall we try to catch it?",
  "53506": "Ah, could I then think that it is in that second nature that the soul is ordained to seek its trials, and that the elements of human virtue find their harmonious place?",
  "53507": "Where could she find it?",
  "53508": "Well, what have you proved?",
  "53509": "This way, or that way?",
  "53510": "How did he strike you, prince?",
  "53511": "But, it will be said, is this all that pure reason can effect, in opening up prospects beyond the limits of experience?",
  "53512": "Why cannot man be content to live alone and be happy, and let the women live alone and be happy too?",
  "53513": "Can equality, by the right of succession, be preserved between citizens, as well as between cousins and brothers?",
  "53514": "Ay, and ashamed of it too?",
  "53515": "Cadby's death was from drowning, you say?",
  "53516": "Where's this young lady I've been hearing such a lot about?",
  "53517": "And how did it happen?",
  "53518": "Has it ever been done before?",
  "53519": "Who's that boy?",
  "53520": "Or do you know some reason why it suits your father's book to amalgamate as well as it suits mine?",
  "53521": "Had you not better light a candle?",
  "53522": "What did that mean, to kiss?",
  "53523": "And how was she to punish her?",
  "53524": "Tyler appointed him?",
  "53525": "Had the nervous strain resulted in a hallucination, or did the door really move?",
  "53526": "Could she not be brought for just one little instant?",
  "53527": "Can you see me?",
  "53528": "Then to put the question is to solve the problem?",
  "53529": "Holding up a bank?",
  "53530": "To meet you in this way, on the sly?",
  "53531": "And what's a sonne?",
  "53532": "What am I to say to him?",
  "53533": "And in the first place, he will honour studies which impress these qualities on his soul and disregard others?",
  "53534": "Would I come and look at it?",
  "53535": "Did you remark the postmarks of those letters?",
  "53536": "Do you see what I meant about the clothes falling off?",
  "53537": "Where is your escort?",
  "53538": "Is it necessary, pray, to illustrate a remark in so practical a style?",
  "53539": "Would he go and describe his rough reception, or recount his exploit?",
  "53540": "What, in the name of everything hideous, did this mean?",
  "53541": "Are you going somewhere?",
  "53542": "Do you know her?",
  "53543": "What can have happened?",
  "53544": "I presume you know, gentlemen, to whom my friend is indebted for this piece of patronage?",
  "53545": "Why are you distressed?",
  "53546": "Are you going to have lunch too?",
  "53547": "And what is the means?",
  "53548": "And if I did know them now, what would it avail me?",
  "53549": "What would you have?",
  "53550": "Revels?",
  "53551": "Now will you believe I'm in earnest?",
  "53552": "Is the sun up?",
  "53553": "Oh, what's that?",
  "53554": "Is it the immediate object of this confidence, that you may at once ascertain that, with my knowledge?",
  "53555": "How large was it?",
  "53556": "Then had I not best send him about his business?",
  "53557": "What does it matter?",
  "53558": "Shall we invite him into our hearts?",
  "53559": "What have you done with her, then, if you have her no longer?",
  "53560": "Then you'll not be wanting me any more tonight, ma'am?",
  "53561": "Jane, do you hear that nightingale singing in the wood?",
  "53562": "Where could they be going?",
  "53563": "Not in regular government pay and employment, to lay traps?",
  "53564": "But who could affirm, who would dare to say, that the amiable fellow did not really see that which his two companions would not see?",
  "53565": "What was it that she wanted of him?",
  "53566": "Where are the nearest?",
  "53567": "How has he drawn you to himself?",
  "53568": "Not even of sending me a scrap of stuff for a new dress?",
  "53569": "If he cuts off one of his own toes, or one of his assistants', would you be very much astonished?",
  "53570": "Where was my baggage?",
  "53571": "Authority?",
  "53572": "Tell him or not tell him?",
  "53573": "O you will let me hold your brave hand, stranger?",
  "53574": "You think so, my lord?",
  "53575": "In your left ear?",
  "53576": "Who shall live up to the great trust?",
  "53577": "Are we there already?",
  "53578": "And my council dares to temper and negotiate?",
  "53579": "How are you?",
  "53580": "It was you, was it not?",
  "53581": "Am I not by?",
  "53582": "Have you given up loving her altogether?",
  "53583": "You have never heard her nephew play?",
  "53584": "What sin, mademoiselle?",
  "53585": "Or that it is impossible to draw more than one right line betwixt any two points?",
  "53586": "Do you think I could ever skip like that?",
  "53587": "When did you leave service?",
  "53588": "Well, what do you think of that?",
  "53589": "What good will he be to the tribe?",
  "53590": "What, did you come digging here entirely because of me?",
  "53591": "Do you feel that you have lost her?",
  "53592": "What, senor?",
  "53593": "Or the raspberry?",
  "53594": "What is there?",
  "53595": "What have you been after?",
  "53596": "But who are all these?",
  "53597": "Oh, I?",
  "53598": "You here again?",
  "53599": "You have no trouble, I hope, to keep you waking?",
  "53600": "What is, or was, their address?",
  "53601": "But of what disease, then, did she die?",
  "53602": "Trodden upon by whom?",
  "53603": "No, but what do you mean?",
  "53604": "Yes, I am out of temper, and do you know why?",
  "53605": "Did you ever hear anything like your brother's eloquence?",
  "53606": "And what is the use of a fellow having a little money if it does not make him independent?",
  "53607": "Why have you no pride?",
  "53608": "Who are you, that you are to play with two young people's affections and break their hearts at your will?",
  "53609": "Yes?",
  "53610": "What is justice?",
  "53611": "How so?",
  "53612": "What's in it?",
  "53613": "Did he himself find no cause for laughter on the earth?",
  "53614": "And who completed it as it now is?"
