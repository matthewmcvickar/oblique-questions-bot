  "1554": "He supposed he was right?",
  "1555": "Is nothing due to the man whom we have all such reason to love, and no reason in the world to think ill of?",
  "1556": "But when you are not sure whether it is a fact or not, what are you to do?",

  "1629": "Would it be some young man or other whom she takes an interest in?",
  "1630": "Is it absolutely necessary to go on with the letter, darling?",
  "1631": "Is that a genuine letter you are reading?",
  "1632": "What could be better?",
  "1633": "What has she been telling you?",
  "1634": "Why is that little, and the little freedom they enjoy, to be infringed?",

  "1651": "How, then, will competition be harmoniously determined in society?",
  "1652": "Have I got to drink that stuff?",
  "1653": "Ruined her?",
  "1654": "So that I need not make use of this petition?",
  "1655": "But what do you conclude from that, father?",

  "2175": "You remember, I said, how the rulers were chosen before?",
  "2176": "Do you think there is no weaker brother among all our lodges that could not be bought?",
  "2177": "To fairs, markets, races, and so forth, I suppose?",
  "2178": "Why are YOU tramping?",
  "2179": "Am I to proceed in my work?",
  "2180": "Graduating well, you mean?",
  "2181": "Why is it that we hesitate?",
  "2182": "Or have you not begun to think about it yet?",
  "2183": "Surely by this time you ought to be able to understand something?",
  "2184": "Who are YOU in this establishment?",
  "2185": "Would not any decent soldier smite him across the face instead of grasping him by the hand?",
  "2186": "Lonely, like the devil, and envious like him?",
  "2187": "But how came he to have so singular a companion?",
  "2188": "Do I understand that he asked for more, after he had eaten the supper allotted by the dietary?",
  "2189": "Had he said anything to give himself away?",
  "2190": "Were they possibly the earth beating time?",
  "2191": "Was he poking fun, or not?",
  "2192": "What's the matter with this fellow?",
  "2193": "Sikes is not, I suppose?",
  "2194": "Why should I tell you what you cannot alter?",
  "2195": "Shall I go to her?",
  "2196": "Is he not, duke?",
  "2197": "And how old were you at that time?",
  "2198": "Why should we not all go?",
  "2199": "I ask what this pretended revolution has revolutionized?",
  "2200": "Do you suppose they keep vodka for sale?",
  "2201": "For how long a time?",
  "2202": "He could be neither of these things, for he had never heard of them, but do you think he is to be pitied for that?",
  "2203": "What makes you think so?",
  "2204": "I do not know, and what if I did?",
  "2205": "What is soon done, sir?",
  "2206": "Is that what you're waiting about for?",
  "2207": "How came ye to talk about that?",
  "2208": "There is a certain formidable machine, have you seen it?",
  "2209": "You hear, D'Artagnan?",
  "2210": "In other words, what are the most salient episodes and the most remarkable phases of the war between labor and capital?",
  "2211": "Ah, really?",
  "2212": "It would be a grand thing for one of those girls, wouldn't it?",
  "2213": "But how is it that you do these things?",
  "2214": "What is it about your pay?",
  "2215": "And you don't think me as handsome as your grandfather?",
  "2216": "Was this another hallucination?",
  "2217": "But, tell me, you have no one else staying here, have you?",
  "2218": "Do they display their charms merely to amuse them?",
  "2219": "Shall we use these, and so be even as to weapons?",
  "2220": "And why should you expect me to take you out riding?",
  "2221": "And what is it done in?",
  "2222": "What, then, are the conditions, the LAWS, of human society?",
  "2223": "Why not, indeed, seeing that at least it would have brought comfort to the poor people of this place?",
  "2224": "It was your play, I believe?",
  "2225": "Yes, monsieur, but once more, to what purpose are all these questions?",
  "2226": "And why now, my pretty simplicity?",
  "2227": "Besides, who knows?",
  "2228": "Why can't people take a line and stick to it?",
  "2229": "Which means, I suppose, that you refuse the service which I asked of you?",
  "2230": "Anything wrong?",
  "2231": "I suppose he can wait below?",
  "2232": "I suppose you have heard what's been happening to the beauty on the hill?",
  "2233": "Whose is that light which makes the eye to see perfectly and the visible to appear?",
  "2234": "The boys weep, and do you not think it is right that a father should weep?",
  "2235": "And what would he have done, the loafer, tell me, what would he have done?",
  "2236": "And what is doing?",
  "2237": "Is there a flood?",
  "2238": "How far had he walked?",
  "2239": "Your second brother?",
  "2240": "What was the use of sending for him?",
  "2241": "And where does he come from?",
  "2242": "What is it, duke?",
  "2243": "Pythangelus?",
  "2244": "I was going to ask, mama, before you were married, had you many suitors?",
  "2245": "Why should you hate the moon?",
  "2246": "Do you know the chapel?",
  "2247": "Who IS it?",
  "2248": "Where are all the eyes that heretofore watched me?",
  "2249": "Know you not, then, that your life is my life, and your death my death?",
  "2250": "Have you relatives?",
  "2251": "She may be free?",
  "2252": "Where is their road?",
  "2253": "Why not attack at once?",
  "2254": "What is allowed, then?",
  "2255": "Is she kind as she is fair?",
  "2256": "But where could such a hound lie concealed, where did it get its food, where did it come from, how was it that no one saw it by day?",
  "2257": "Have we made an erroneous interpretation of the document?",
  "2258": "Let me go on your bob?",
  "2259": "And you will tell me this secret?",
  "2260": "Is this body destined for such work?",
  "2261": "Your majesty is joking, have you not a million?",
  "2262": "Is there nothing you could take to give you present relief?",
  "2263": "Ought you to feel discouraged?",
  "2264": "To be sure, he who never liveth at the right time, how could he ever die at the right time?",
  "2265": "What will become of her now?",
  "2266": "What are you coming for?",
  "2267": "What's pretence?",
  "2268": "Hadn't I better play something?",
  "2269": "And why did you wish to see me?",
  "2270": "Call?",
  "2271": "Was it possible that we were on our way down through the mountains again?",
  "2272": "Well, what DO you know of him?",
  "2273": "A woman or an ape?",
  "2274": "Day?",
  "2275": "Who said I would not go?",
  "2276": "What was that?",
  "2277": "How is it he leaves me alone in my misery?",
  "2278": "What is the use of preserving slang?",
  "2279": "But what have I done to inspire you with such a feeling of thankfulness?",
  "2280": "You have, then, fulfilled my command, and composed a new interlude?",
  "2281": "The mysterious speaker?",
  "2282": "And how should I be able to recognize, and know, and designate by name what is strange to me, and what I have never before felt?",
  "2283": "No divisions?",
  "2284": "You don't mean you are coming with us?",
  "2285": "For your marriage?",
  "2286": "Am I in the right?",
  "2287": "Brickmakers, eh?",
  "2288": "Well, what does it all mean?",
  "2289": "To anybody?",
  "2290": "What do you hope, then?",
  "2291": "Well, would you mind my reforming myself this afternoon?",
  "2292": "Then you know me?",
  "2293": "What about meals?",
  "2294": "ART SICK?",
  "2295": "And what did he do?",
  "2296": "And her brother?",
  "2297": "You have heerd tell of cotton rags dipt in turpentine, hav'nt you, how they produce combustion?",
  "2298": "But what appeal could it be?",
  "2299": "Wrong?",
  "2300": "Do you want me to tell everything?",
  "2301": "Rob suggested?",
  "2302": "And is the soul in agreement with the affections of the body?",
  "2303": "Would you like this room, sir?",
  "2304": "What do I hear?",
  "2305": "Shall I stop the boat and try to get you out here?",
  "2306": "You?",
  "2307": "Markova?",
  "2308": "You haven't any place to go, have you?",
  "2309": "What is there for us?",
  "2310": "Besides, shall we not bear the lords of the habitable earth to be lords over us, and yet bear tyrants of our own country?",
  "2311": "When, and in what month?",
  "2312": "But what are we to do with him?",
  "2313": "Why can you not bear them?",
  "2314": "I wonder if all the things move along with us?",
  "2315": "Why this negation, if a modification was sufficient?",
  "2316": "Was this idolized parent still in existence?",
  "2317": "Who follows me?",
  "2318": "But how in the name of all that's wonderful does he GET OUT?",
  "2319": "Could the professor throw any light upon that?",
  "2320": "Can't we be good friends?",
  "2321": "Could it be possible that the sense of unreality in which he felt himself imprisoned had communicated itself to his wife?",
  "2322": "Why alas?",
  "2323": "What do you mean by that, monsieur?",
  "2324": "After having met with so many who promised, when shall I find one who will give?",
  "2325": "What the deuce are you talking about?",
  "2326": "Coffins, where?",
  "2327": "You are not in debt, then?",
  "2328": "Why should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice of the people?",
  "2329": "I love you, I?",
  "2330": "Surely there is no necessity for you to say one word, mama?",
  "2331": "That's eight months she has been away, surely?",
  "2332": "Who shall go in?",
  "2333": "Will you sell them for five francs?",
  "2334": "Why negotiate, and above all why retreat, when to retreat is so contrary to his method of conducting war?",
  "2335": "You wanted to speak to her?",
  "2336": "But am I not your nearest relative?",
  "2337": "Then what do you think, mother, has become of 'em?",
  "2338": "You have written to your father?",
  "2339": "Ought it not?",
  "2340": "Did he tell you so himself?",
  "2341": "The ladies are great observers, sir?",
  "2342": "Are you come to do anything in my way, sir?",
  "2343": "Have you honours?",
  "2344": "I may marry somebody when I grow up but I'm far too young to be thinking of it yet, don't you think, teacher?",
  "2345": "Suppose, now, I could give you up to a rich man who would be able to insure you against all wants?",
  "2346": "If so, why is it not among his papers?",
  "2347": "What's your name, portress?",
  "2348": "How big is this hole?",
  "2349": "Jest t' pull me along outer th' road?",
  "2350": "Hear you how they are sawing and hammering there below?",
  "2351": "Don't ye love sperm?",
  "2352": "Now what say you to aluminum, gentlemen?",
  "2353": "How much am I worth?",
  "2354": "What put that in your head?",
  "2355": "Had she never looked for the door?",
  "2356": "Everything?",
  "2357": "Do you think he will object to it?",
  "2358": "What think you of such a song as this?",
  "2359": "Have they not heard that of their colonel?",
  "2360": "Who was the gentleman?",
  "2361": "How could he have me in view, and not be aware of it himself?",
  "2362": "What is your name?",
  "2363": "How did I take to it?",
  "2364": "And she is getting on well, you say?",
  "2365": "Have you anything to ask, sire, before we part?",
  "2366": "Are you mad?",
  "2367": "And what does it mean?",
  "2368": "Now, then, who are you?",
  "2369": "Why do I wish to unite you two?",
  "2370": "Do I look like a sweep, then?",
  "2371": "Why, how fail to understand?",
  "2372": "You understand me?",
  "2373": "Brownlow, I believe, sir?",
  "2374": "Why have I always to complain of you?",
  "2375": "Why do you pity them?",
  "2376": "Yes, but could not the mistake be rectified?",
  "2377": "What is the matter, said he, my chicken?",
  "2378": "Am I not to know to whom to present it?",
  "2379": "I say, madam, what do you propose to do with these papers?",
  "2380": "Yes, d'you want anything?",
  "2381": "Are we ready?",
  "2382": "Have you any better explanation?",
  "2383": "Who was it gave me that rogues' march from the stocks to the gallows's foot?",
  "2384": "Why, pray?",
  "2385": "Now could I speak of that which is not yet?",
  "2386": "What is the proprietor?",
  "2387": "Would you mind stepping in for a moment?",
  "2388": "Shall I say yes or shall I say no?",
  "2389": "What should you be out of spirits for?",
  "2390": "Do you always want to be fooled?",
  "2391": "At this last moment I ask you, have we not long been betrothed to each other in our secret hearts?",
  "2392": "Ripping, isn't it?",
  "2393": "If you hadn't a been dogged, where'd you a been now?",
  "2394": "When did this happen?",
  "2395": "Something about somebody laughing at a locksmith?",
  "2396": "For what are you fighting?",
  "2397": "And that is adding insult to injury, is it?",
  "2398": "And where will I look for 'em?",
  "2399": "Gentlemen, is that a true view of the case?",
  "2400": "It was with a hilted knife maybe?",
  "2401": "Was he really doing everything that could be expected of him?",
  "2402": "How fare ye?",
  "2403": "What noise was that?",
  "2404": "But will the person who shall accompany you afterward be a man or a woman?",
  "2405": "Yes, but how am I to give it up?",
  "2406": "We may depend on you?",
  "2407": "Does it really seem so to you?",
  "2408": "You've been tramping in the sun, and it's a very warm night, and hadn't you better sleep over the notion?",
  "2409": "And you really live by the river?",
  "2410": "Shall not the grief of the old time follow?",
  "2411": "Couldn't you manage to hold me in your arms?",
  "2412": "Isn't he very rich?",
  "2413": "Some authentic relic?",
  "2414": "Why are you not at work?",
  "2415": "Why did I suddenly loose my grip of her?",
  "2416": "Sure you did?",
  "2417": "Sylvestre?",
  "2418": "An't that as nat'ral as a sheep's bleating, or a pig's grunting, or a horse's neighing, or a bird's singing?",
  "2419": "Was it a kind of adoration for so much purity?",
  "2420": "It would have embarrassed what?",
  "2421": "Would you prefer a more humble life, a life more suited to your strength?",
  "2422": "What he?",
  "2423": "What did you suppose, then?",
  "2424": "Did we not finish it?",
  "2425": "Will you be mine?",
  "2426": "He did not proceed to blows?",
  "2427": "What else had she herself meant three minutes before by speaking of her as great?",
  "2428": "Why has the legislator given hands to this conspiracy of monopolies, to this interdict upon theories belonging to all?",
  "2429": "And do you suppose it weighs on him any less than on you?",
  "2430": "Do you wish these proofs, these attestations, which I alone possess, to be destroyed?",
  "2431": "Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?",
  "2432": "You do not like?",
  "2433": "You are going to be married?",
  "2434": "And will you, sir, get your living by the counsel of traitors?",
  "2435": "Wot job?",
  "2436": "What happened in the house?",
  "2437": "Why do you not ask the fisherman for his cutlass?",
  "2438": "If harm befell him, what would be our fate?",
  "2439": "You mark me sir?",
  "2440": "And what would you yourself say?",
  "2441": "Do you think, gentlemen, that I look like an innkeeper?",
  "2442": "Did you ever see him?",
  "2443": "And yet you say he is not a medical student?",
  "2444": "Are there children or are there not?",
  "2445": "What is he?",
  "2446": "Where have they been put?",
  "2447": "How does my sweet lady?",
  "2448": "And what was his purpose?",
  "2449": "Ah, you know it?",
  "2450": "Why don't they jump in and destroy these fliers?",
  "2451": "But with a beard, you tell me?",
  "2452": "But, on the other hand, whose blood was that which lay so thickly upon the floor?",
  "2453": "Well, what did you see, sir, or think you saw?",
  "2454": "What was taking place within him?",
  "2455": "You love me, don't you?",
  "2456": "What did you force me to run away with you for?",
  "2457": "Did I groan all right?",
  "2458": "Known what?",
  "2459": "You, my poor child, suffer poverty and hunger?",
  "2460": "Was it by his extensive knowledge, by his exquisite judgment, or by his heroic valour?",
  "2461": "Whose language would he speak?",
  "2462": "Yer powers wasn't enough to carry 'ee through?",
  "2463": "Perhaps you would care to try?",
  "2464": "Why should he change his name in a country where no one knew his original one?",
  "2465": "What can it know about the matter?",
  "2466": "Shall we begin education with music, and go on to gymnastic afterwards?",
  "2467": "Shall we try it?",
  "2468": "I hope I have not driven her away?",
  "2469": "Where does he come in?",
  "2470": "Why have you hatched these vipers which, when they shall have grown, will inflict injury on all, beginning with yourself?",
  "2471": "What have I seen?",
  "2472": "Am not I dreaming?",
  "2473": "Am I to say what you told me?",
  "2474": "What could be more just?",
  "2475": "How many shots?",
  "2476": "Why did he leave?",
  "2477": "Well, and what then?",
  "2478": "Do you pity him?",
  "2479": "To be cased up and hung by on the wall?",
  "2480": "Sword?",
  "2481": "You heard what I said to the prince?",
  "2482": "What's to be done?",
  "2483": "Are there any good men?",
  "2484": "Diminish public burdens, assess taxes on a more equitable basis?",
  "2485": "Who can deny that one's physical conditions determine one's character or personality?",
  "2486": "How am I to know?",
  "2487": "I have sent for three of my friends, but who knows whether they were at home?",
  "2488": "A qui cette voiture la?",
  "2489": "I say, aren't we much too soon?",
  "2490": "Do you like it?",
  "2491": "And who is there that will either take the trouble or incur the odium, of a strict scrunity into the secret springs of the transaction?",
  "2492": "Are the other children in bed?",
  "2493": "Does he make it against that newspaper editor merely?",
  "2494": "Why torture me now?",
  "2495": "Abideth there husband for me, after the son of my uncle?",
  "2496": "Or have you dined?",
  "2497": "Cur aliquid vidi?",
  "2498": "Or, was he?",
  "2499": "Had you ever seen it before?",
  "2500": "Have I positive and substantive proof of what I assert?",
  "2501": "How could you let it go so?",
  "2502": "Why should I look at the letter?",
  "2503": "Won't you please be good enough to send my tea into the library?",
  "2504": "But how did it turn out with me?",
  "2505": "You won't want another dog, will you?",
  "2506": "The prosecutor was reading, was he?",
  "2507": "Well, sirs, is everybody here?",
  "2508": "How are they when you've done?",
  "2509": "And you are still satisfied?",
  "2510": "How shall I understand you?",
  "2511": "But what do the young woman say herself about it?",
  "2512": "And will you tell me what you read therein, monseigneur?",
  "2513": "Would it not be a wilful throwing away of a chance not to avail himself of it?",
  "2514": "Pray, sir, what is the soul?",
  "2515": "The child, my child?",
  "2516": "Wot do you want to throw 'im over for?",
  "2517": "I say, what are we going to do?",
  "2518": "Stubbs?",
  "2519": "Does he speak loudly when spoken to by his master?",
  "2520": "But with such ideas what motive have you for living?",
  "2521": "Why, all men strive and who succeeds?",
  "2522": "Don't you smell the roses?",
  "2523": "Haven't I given up expecting anything?",
  "2524": "Where is faith?",
  "2525": "You won't be provoked with me, will you?",
  "2526": "Your father?",
  "2527": "Haven't I said I'm not going to gwovel?",
  "2528": "What more could parents do than they had done?",
  "2529": "The police?",
  "2530": "You have hopes of solving it?",
  "2531": "What's the use wearing my good ones around here?",
  "2532": "Well, what of that?",
  "2533": "Who, in such case, is to be the judge?",
  "2534": "Where have you dined?",
  "2535": "You were doubtless surprised at my letter?",
  "2536": "How could you think I should jest on such a subject?",
  "2537": "Tell me, comte, is she in love with him?",
  "2538": "What do you think now?",
  "2539": "Cannot even the fact of their being in arms for the nation, liable to die any day in its defence, secure them ordinary justice?",
  "2540": "Why, you can't live on it, can you?",
  "2541": "And the ghost of a herring cob?",
  "2542": "Why, whatever hope can you have?",
  "2543": "Are these sages alive?",
  "2544": "How on earth can I tell?",
  "2545": "Why should he take such a poor girl as you by the hand, as your letter says he has done twice?",
  "2546": "Have you know him long, miss?",
  "2547": "Nor so much as a rather reverend dissenting gentleman?",
  "2548": "You are defending me?",
  "2549": "But how do you get back on board?",
  "2550": "Well, you are their employer, ain't you?",
  "2551": "Jack, you anointed scoundrel, what do you mean?",
  "2552": "Hear him?",
  "2553": "What are these creatures doing?",
  "2554": "Have not all insects gay colours?",
  "2555": "Are you the architect of the prisons, monsieur?",
  "2556": "His kind?",
  "2557": "And you are looking after this hawk in the skies?",
  "2558": "Are all these tales such cobwebs and moon talk?",
  "2559": "But what have you done?",
  "2560": "The boys are all as they were, I suppose?",
  "2561": "Is no one to go to his assistance?",
  "2562": "Isn't it good just to be alive on a day like this?",
  "2563": "I wonder what will happen when the third time comes?",
  "2564": "Rich enough to work with tolerable peace of mind?",
  "2565": "And what is delight but another name for pleasure?",
  "2566": "You don't see who I am?",
  "2567": "Oil?",
  "2568": "You will like going, will you not?",
  "2569": "Where the devil shall I say that he is, so that he cannot try to rejoin him?",
  "2570": "But who, after all, is doing this?",
  "2571": "Then must I knock, or call when just in sight?",
  "2572": "But how can she fail to see it, and what is going on in her?",
  "2573": "Toward what quarter of the world should they direct their endeavors?",
  "2574": "Are you going to live next door to me in the box?",
  "2575": "Was this their virtue, or contempt of life?",
  "2576": "Are not our ears already full of bad sounds?",
  "2577": "Is it necessary to go into that?",
  "2578": "How come you to have a weepon?",
  "2579": "D'you think I've changed since you were here last?",
  "2580": "Did I do right, monsieur?",
  "2581": "That's the riddle, what does she want?",
  "2582": "And what do you learn about them?",
  "2583": "Still at it, then?",
  "2584": "What is the next dean to have, twelve or fifteen?",

  "3431": "And the country which was enough to support the original inhabitants will be too small now, and not enough?",
  "3432": "You live alone, then?",
  "3433": "What can I know of him?",
  "3434": "Do you really think so?",
  "3435": "Are pleasures, as pleasures, alike?",
  "3436": "Am I to understand that you have this young woman's interests at heart?",
  "3437": "And that is situated?",
  "3438": "What does he want more?",
  "3439": "Are they mad?",
  "3440": "Will you ever know the terrible sacrifice of pride, of dignity, of womanliness a devoted sister is making for your sake?",
  "3441": "What depressed you?",
  "3442": "But of whom did you speak first?",
  "3443": "Nothing?",
  "3444": "WHAT IS WAR?",
  "3445": "You know the legend, I suppose?",
  "3446": "So there is something beyond duty?",
  "3447": "Then why should they quarrel with us?",
  "3448": "Say about what?",
  "3449": "But, at least, tell us who is there?",
  "3450": "Are the brethren satisfied?",
  "3451": "An't it enough we catch the boy for ye?",
  "3452": "You intend to introduce the prince?",
  "3453": "And whither was he now going?",
  "3454": "What I should rather say is does he know how much?",
  "3455": "Is there no child?",
  "3456": "But what would you have us to do here, now that the king is dead?",
  "3457": "How do men get money?",
  "3458": "Now what excuse have you to make?",
  "3459": "Whither are we going now?",
  "3460": "But have you ever watched him carefully?",
  "3461": "Shall I take the call?",
  "3462": "And what is that proof?",
  "3463": "How could you say such a thing?",
  "3464": "You didn't mind it?",
  "3465": "What hopes?",
  "3466": "Why did you never mention this?",
  "3467": "Perhaps you hate me too, now that I've told you as much?",
  "3468": "Who is she?",
  "3469": "What does the thermometer say?",
  "3470": "Who is your father?",
  "3471": "What do you want, my grandson?",
  "3472": "Well, what do you think of the arrangement, prince?",
  "3473": "What old man?",
  "3474": "You wouldn't wish to keep the luck all to yourself?",
  "3475": "How do you know about them?",
  "3476": "Why were they seized with senile debility in the sixteenth century?",
  "3477": "How, then, shall I conclude this very unsatisfactory account?",
  "3478": "But how about the chance of his holding someone up before he goes?",
  "3479": "How dare you sit in my throne?",
  "3480": "Shall we take off our doublets?",
  "3481": "And who for?",
  "3482": "What shall be the end of so many labours and crosses?",
  "3483": "Did he cut me?",
  "3484": "Good music?",
  "3485": "And after the bear?",
  "3486": "And wherein is that power contained?",
  "3487": "Who knows what may happen?",
  "3488": "Sebastian?",
  "3489": "Dido loved, and what came of it?",
  "3490": "What creature?",
  "3491": "Will that man come?",
  "3492": "You weren't away?",
  "3493": "Has he done it any harm?",
  "3494": "What is it meant to prove?",
  "3495": "Do you observe?",
  "3496": "But to what did they owe the convulsion and rapture of their transport?",
  "3497": "This is getting interesting, is it not?",
  "3498": "What is there in it?",
  "3499": "Would she not be afraid to join it herself?",
  "3500": "Well, the question is, my dear prince, do you know anything about it?",
  "3501": "What does he come here cheeking us for, then?",
  "3502": "And in a railway carriage?",
  "3503": "What, my sons, shall you assail your father, friend, and chief confessed?",
  "3504": "Did you blow them up yourself?",
  "3505": "The count does not know?",
  "3506": "Is civil conquest then so base and vile?",
  "3507": "Javert?",
  "3508": "Watson?",
  "3509": "And did he arrive in time?",
  "3510": "Hein?",
  "3511": "Then why should you mind?",
  "3512": "How did that fellow get here?",
  "3513": "Experience?",
  "3514": "Then from whence, my friends, in a human point of view, do we derive the strength that is necessary to our limbs?",
  "3515": "What right has this woman to write in this way to you?",
  "3516": "WOHIN?",
  "3517": "Do you know who you are, and what you are?",
  "3518": "Do we even know whether we shall find a house in which to pass the night?",
  "3519": "Why do you think that?",
  "3520": "You wish that, too?",
  "3521": "How do you know all that?",
  "3522": "I suppose the children may begin, uncle?",
  "3523": "I do not understand how you can meet the soul of your lost mother by looking in this mirror?",
  "3524": "And she doesn't know anything?",
  "3525": "How dare you urge me to it, young man?",
  "3526": "Is she calling on the corpses to rise and have a dance among the graves?",
  "3527": "How could she write about that at all?",
  "3528": "And what we mean by 'seen' and 'not seen' is that which is or is not visible to the eye of man?",
  "3529": "Is she alone in that room?",
  "3530": "And what theory could ever have included that peculiar method?",
  "3531": "What avails reason if it cannot make me understand?",
  "3532": "But how could any of you feel sure of me when I couldn't so much as feel sure of myself?",
  "3533": "But what ought to be their course?",
  "3534": "But is the sum worth the trouble to which you expose yourself?",
  "3535": "Who really knows her?",
  "3536": "Have you had fresh news, then?",
  "3537": "Why didn't you?",
  "3538": "Why not go to those lawyers that manage things for the company and get them to arrange it all for you with the college?",
  "3539": "Mine, sire?",
  "3540": "How do you think you would write or speak about anything more difficult, if you knew no more of grammar than he does?",
  "3541": "What was the good of damping the energy they displayed in the painful work of escape?",
  "3542": "Will you soon start again?",
  "3543": "Punished?",
  "3544": "Would we do anything which would hurt or offend you?",
  "3545": "You have not let those four men go?",
  "3546": "If, then, the proprietor, shielding himself behind his comfort and his rights, refuses to employ the laborer, how can the laborer live?",
  "3547": "Is it you that would dispute it?",
  "3548": "You heard a horse was stolen from our neighbour yesterday?",
  "3549": "What is it that's wrong with her?",
  "3550": "Where is your room?",
  "3551": "What wicked gossip were you talking over there?",
  "3552": "But in how many does your worship think we shall have the use of our feet?",
  "3553": "And which does the soul resemble?",
  "3554": "What business had she to do it?",
  "3555": "But how do you do?",
  "3556": "Do you think you can escape?",
  "3557": "Verum secretumque mouseion, quam multa invenitis, quam multa dictatis?",
  "3558": "Why do they offer it?",
  "3559": "Now what can I do for you all?",
  "3560": "Then he is no longer sad?",
  "3561": "Don't I listen to her willingly?",
  "3562": "What future?",
  "3563": "What sets him on?",
  "3564": "What hidden thing could be in that room that she did not wish him to see?",
  "3565": "Is he your friend, by any chance?",
  "3566": "Shall you write to him?",
  "3567": "Aren't you ever going to finish that story and give me some of the profits?",
  "3568": "We are safe here, at last, eh?",
  "3569": "Tell me at once, why have you suddenly developed this 'profound respect,' eh?",
  "3570": "Then you are rich?",
  "3571": "You heard that?",
  "3572": "And why so?",
  "3573": "How could the king have fallen in love with her?",
  "3574": "What would that answer be?",
  "3575": "What did they think of the proposal?",
  "3576": "Was not that what ye said?",
  "3577": "Must I?",
  "3578": "But are you sure it's the lady, and not the gentleman?",
  "3579": "And who would employ him, ostensibly?",
  "3580": "It's profitable enough for two, is it?",
  "3581": "Then for a holiday?",
  "3582": "Why do the sun and the earth seem changeless and constant to you?",
  "3583": "Do you know what that means?",
  "3584": "What makes people call them green?",
  "3585": "Why, do you suspect his merit?",
  "3586": "And we shall neither have CHARQUI, nor hard eggs, nor fillets of ostrich?",
  "3587": "What does he teach you?",
  "3588": "Why do you ask me now?",
  "3589": "What is to be the end of this?",
  "3590": "Does he want me to throw a bottle at his head?",
  "3591": "What town is it, mister?",
  "3592": "Well, don't you see what I'm driving at?",
  "3593": "The masters?",
  "3594": "How can you have knowledge not in your head?",
  "3595": "Could a human society of any sort exist if there were no sympathy or tender feeling, no impulse to seek the company of other men?",
  "3596": "What effect do you think it will have upon his plans now that he knows you are here?",
  "3597": "How can you tell me what you know is false?",
  "3598": "What woman is there worth a straw that has not?",
  "3599": "Was it dry?",
  "3600": "Can I see him?",
  "3601": "Why, are you not?",
  "3602": "Apart from personal vanity, what would they sell it for?",
  "3603": "Yet are you not capricious, sir?",
  "3604": "Did you ask her why she hurried away that night?",
  "3605": "Do you belong on it?",
  "3606": "What were those masses?",
  "3607": "Would it not have been much more convenient to take all that kind of goods on board in 'Frisco?",
  "3608": "You think, then, that you could live more wisely than other people?",
  "3609": "Or am I a liar?",
  "3610": "Where are they now?",
  "3611": "If it were one of your friends you would hesitate, then?",
  "3612": "But does your fair interpret industry?",
  "3613": "Where are your servants?",
  "3614": "Was she out with him today?",
  "3615": "Isn't it disgusting?",
  "3616": "How can it, if we two be secret?",
  "3617": "But where shall I go?",
  "3618": "And over yonder?",
  "3619": "What breaks in me?",
  "3620": "How did the physician's father get his fortune?",
  "3621": "But perhaps you will be angry with me for it when we meet again presently?",
  "3622": "Did you speak with him?",
  "3623": "Who is he that walks alone between the companies?",
  "3624": "What his promises?",
  "3625": "Why not, madame?",
  "3626": "Well, what IS the song, then?",
  "3627": "What is it you would say?",
  "3628": "Won't you let me do that for you?",
  "3629": "Did you find nothing in the room which could furnish a clue to the murderer?",
  "3630": "The scout has said as much?",
  "3631": "Who was it then?",
  "3632": "Is the steward an apothecary, sir?",
  "3633": "Can we solve the problems confronting us?",
  "3634": "Hadn't you better notify the police?",
  "3635": "What of?",
  "3636": "Shall we suppose that it is impossible to discover it?",
  "3637": "It's a little awkward for me, isn't it?",
  "3638": "Laws, how do I know?",
  "3639": "And why are we afraid of death, while we are pleased with the rest that we have in sleep?",
  "3640": "And would you still cane me if I took it into my head to disobey you?",
  "3641": "Is it TOM?",
  "3642": "Whence can it arise, then?",
  "3643": "Is this just towards her?",
  "3644": "Has he come home, sir?",
  "3645": "A play?",
  "3646": "Where then have you been?",
  "3647": "What could that light be?",
  "3648": "Why don't you supply the city?",
  "3649": "What's the good of a man flittering away his life?",
  "3650": "Kryltzoff, have you any cigarettes?",
  "3651": "But the sun?",
  "3652": "Who, therefore, O king of the world, among all those who vaunt themselves as having luck, has more than I have?",
  "3653": "You think, then, all is not over yet?",
  "3654": "Can there be two opinions of the advantage of education?",
  "3655": "There has been no battle, then?",
  "3656": "Am I to accompany you, your excellency?",
  "3657": "Have you ever worked at anything before?",
  "3658": "In all my embassies have I been weak to the strong or bullying toward the weak?",
  "3659": "Are you not the beloved of one of my best friends?",
  "3660": "And if that be so, upon whom should they call to their helping rather than him who can help them most, and is their very lord?",
  "3661": "What do you want, my friend?",
  "3662": "Should he station a whole company at the post?",
  "3663": "Can anything be done to relieve situation, now acute?",
  "3664": "But is this equally true of the greatness and smallness of the fingers?",
  "3665": "And our masters?",
  "3666": "HAD he reason?",
  "3667": "He said something in praise of your eyes, did he?",
  "3668": "Will you give him to me, monseigneur, if I ask him of you?",
  "3669": "Has he not even got his hat on?",
  "3670": "Will it be any wonder if it go down to the grave with us at the appointed time?",
  "3671": "Do you know of anything with a long, thin body?",
  "3672": "Come, tell me, please, what you did abroad?",
  "3673": "I wonder if we'll ever see them again?",
  "3674": "Isn't he right that everything in the world is base and loathsome?",
  "3675": "But where are those fierce warriors now?",
  "3676": "Of whom am I talking to you?",
  "3677": "Does he put up with it?",
  "3678": "Was I born for nothing but to write?",
  "3679": "And pray who told you this?",
  "3680": "Checkers, weren't it?",
  "3681": "How often must I remind you that I'm blind?",
  "3682": "In what order shall we draw?",
  "3683": "Hasn't he gone on deck?",
  "3684": "You've done with him altogether?",
  "3685": "What does he do anything for?",
  "3686": "Who does not feel the irresistible arm drag?",
  "3687": "Money?",
  "3688": "Where the devil will constancy niche itself next?",
  "3689": "Well, how did he get it?",
  "3690": "You remember the letter?",
  "3691": "What is its substance and material?",
  "3692": "What do you ask of me?",
  "3693": "Do you know, you would have frightened any one who did not know you?",
  "3694": "But what sort of man do you mean?",
  "3695": "Dispepsy?",
  "3696": "Seryozha?",
  "3697": "What passenger?",
  "3698": "And what else?",
  "3699": "Well, how did it go?",
  "3700": "Where it went?",
  "3701": "What was he there for?",
  "3702": "Have you read the paper?",
  "3703": "Have you no pity, no heart?",
  "3704": "Oh, it's you, is it?",
  "3705": "Well, whose fault is it?",
  "3706": "Coming up the hill, and at the top of the hill, both?",
  "3707": "What's this, then?",
  "3708": "As for her, when would she so much go beyond herself as to accept him at the quick of death?",
  "3709": "Now go and hoe your own row?",
  "3710": "Are you going to make our shelter another tied house for him, and ask me to keep it?",
  "3711": "Do you feel your attack coming on?",
  "3712": "Go back?",
  "3713": "Don't you pray?",
  "3714": "How should he know?",
  "3715": "What would my son do?",
  "3716": "Why do you come back so late?",
  "3717": "What if we have but one home?",
  "3718": "Was she born in your house?",
  "3719": "In what respect?",
  "3720": "By obeying through fear, instead of practising the forbearance, which we all stand in need of ourselves?",
  "3721": "Did he think of escaping from it?",
  "3722": "That it may be alienated by consent, in order to beget that commerce and intercourse, which is so BENEFICIAL to human society?",
  "3723": "Lansquenet, for instance?",
  "3724": "Do you see that?",
  "3725": "Has my wife told you that you two are free to go off whenever you please?",
  "3726": "Neb, perhaps?",
  "3727": "Even ignorance?",
  "3728": "Not the army, I fear?",
  "3729": "Is not he a charming man?",
  "3730": "Is it very easy?",
  "3731": "How different was their state while undisputed lords of the soil?",
  "3732": "And what is it?",
  "3733": "D'you know at what time he'll be here?",
  "3734": "Oh, whoever you may be, do you not remember?",
  "3735": "Have there ever been such philosophers?",
  "3736": "Have you then never seen it not only as your right, but as your bounden duty, worked up to such a pitch, to speak to your husband?",
  "3737": "I suppose she feels the separation from them?",
  "3738": "Why shouldn't I?",
  "3739": "Then you beg?",
  "3740": "Who writes a keener epigram?",
  "3741": "Haven't you any news for us?",
  "3742": "Have you an order to see him in prison?",
  "3743": "With him near, who could entertain fear?",
  "3744": "But where can I get pistols?",
  "3745": "What is death for me?",
  "3746": "Then, if all souls are equally by their nature souls, all souls of all living creatures will be equally good?",
  "3747": "Is she a cross woman?",
  "3748": "What more did she want than to know and feel this?",
  "3749": "Are you going to listen to her ravings?",
  "3750": "Besides, were not those riches chimerical?",
  "3751": "But can they proclaim themselves entirely irresponsible for this condition?",
  "3752": "There's nothing you'll be wanting, is there?",
  "3753": "How does it serve you right?",
  "3754": "Were they to be weighed against pounds sterling per annum?",
  "3755": "Which are the better at heavy physical tasks, boys or men?",
  "3756": "Any answer, ma'am?",
  "3757": "Smoke?",
  "3758": "What signs are there of a hound?",
  "3759": "What will the owners say, sir?",
  "3760": "Do you make that of it?",
  "3761": "Nothing better to do?",
  "3762": "Am I then a dog?",
  "3763": "Somebody hurt?",
  "3764": "Is he a poor man?",
  "3765": "And what is the prime of life?",
  "3766": "But how is it that judgment is perverted on the one hand, and on the other that faculties are degraded?",
  "3767": "What was he to do now?",
  "3768": "Shall we be trotting home again?",
  "3769": "Now, officers, have you done?",
  "3770": "Or popularity?",
  "3771": "No, men are so cowardly, aren't they?",
  "3772": "Is he ill, or simply shamming?",
  "3773": "And did she find these details tedious?",
  "3774": "Primmins?",
  "3775": "Or shall it take a paternal interest in its citizens, making them virtuous and happy in spite of themselves?",
  "3776": "And you fainted?",
  "3777": "Aren't the chestnuts in flower?",
  "3778": "And why should he have done so?",
  "3779": "You were called?",
  "3780": "And how did he look, sir?",
  "3781": "Why do you speak of finding fault?",
  "3782": "Make a move?",
  "3783": "You are too old for love in a cottage, I suppose?",
  "3784": "You are the husband of the sister of this boy?",
  "3785": "Why not keep it?",
  "3786": "What choice remains to me?",
  "3787": "Are all your family well?",

  "3790": "But what's the matter?",
  "3791": "Who knows what shall have befallen then?",
  "3792": "Who and what are you?",
  "3793": "In stature, sir?",
  "3794": "Of course do you understand that for any other purpose he's no man for me, nor for you?",
  "3795": "Has the law a memory for all those soft recollections you endeavor to recall?",
  "3796": "Who is able to determine precisely how much is put on and how much is real in the actions of a woman?",
  "3797": "Don't respect him any longer, eh?",
  "3798": "When the sea topped the bulwarks, what did it look like?",
  "3799": "Then have we really all the particulars now?",
  "3800": "Why couldn't I know better than address utter strangers in such a way?",
  "3801": "Lad of our heart, where are you?",
  "3802": "I won't ask what, because we are going to be VERY nice with each other, aren't we, and never, never, vex each other any more?",
  "3803": "Do you, do you?",
  "3804": "Which way have they taken?",
  "3805": "And leave us to hang, is it, for a saucy liar, the like of you?",
  "3806": "Well, which of the four do you like best?",
  "3807": "Shall I let you hear me sing now?",
  "3808": "But aren't they a power?",
  "3809": "Do you hear?",
  "3810": "But if I beg you to make it up?",
  "3811": "Why should you want to see this stranger turned out of the house?",
  "3812": "Is it any wonder, then, that I prize it?",
  "3813": "But not much, is it?",
  "3814": "Could you trust in him?",
  "3815": "Is it to be believed?",
  "3816": "I wonder what dey'll be doin' next?",
  "3817": "What are you doing down here?",
  "3818": "Ran into her?",
  "3819": "Would it not be expecting too much to hope to succeed at your first attempt?",
  "3820": "If he no longer cares for me, why silent?",
  "3821": "Mangles?",
  "3822": "Who would deny his mistress aught?",
  "3823": "And the good is advantageous?",
  "3824": "When was it decided?",
  "3825": "Could it have been otherwise?",
  "3826": "Shall I tell you about him?",
  "3827": "According to the dactyle?",
  "3828": "Why shouldn't he tell us something?",
  "3829": "Did you really slap her?",
  "3830": "How soon would I get a place?",
  "3831": "Then, how do you know?",
  "3832": "How shall I describe what we saw?",
  "3833": "Well, and whose fault is that?",
  "3834": "What would she think of him if he now devoted himself to a married woman?",
  "3835": "Why did you not return?",
  "3836": "Was any desire more rational?",
  "3837": "Does he understand?",
  "3838": "Well, does not this tell you that in grief, as in life, there is always something to look forward to beyond?",
  "3839": "And how had he been paid?",
  "3840": "What is the right of occupancy?",
  "3841": "Do you really mean it?",
  "3842": "Why have you not advised me?",
  "3843": "Does it mean a captive, or a place of captivity?",
  "3844": "Well, the next farm, where the pigs are in the potatoe field, whose is that?",
  "3845": "Then you want me to have one of my headaches?",
  "3846": "And what would happen then?",
  "3847": "And why have stood so long untenanted?",
  "3848": "What did he do?",
  "3849": "Now, what are you pestewing me for?",

  "4712": "Until some one rare and grand result is reached which may be good, and may be the reverse of good?",
  "4713": "Hey?",
  "4714": "Have you had that youngster with you long?",
  "4715": "Is he not rich enough to keep the estate in good order?",
  "4716": "What will he want with me?",
  "4717": "Not alone, are you?",
  "4718": "Wolves, jaguars, or apes?",
  "4719": "He said he knew them well enough, but what was there in that?",
  "4720": "But is it not a heavy load?",
  "4721": "Why wait here for the divorce?",
  "4722": "Disappointment?",
  "4723": "And have your notions changed?",
  "4724": "How shall we dare to think well of ourselves again?",
  "4725": "What of the country's people?",
  "4726": "We men are determined, nay, are we not pledged, to destroy this monster?",
  "4727": "A geographer would be of much use to our expedition, and what can be nobler than to bring science to the service of humanity?",
  "4728": "How on earth could any reasonable man expect a girl to let herself go at this stage of the proceedings?",

  "4783": "Willl you be so good as to take a chair here by me and look over this paper?",
  "4784": "Nothing more?",
  "4785": "Why not put her into his confidence before they started?",
  "4786": "Do you wish to speak to us?",

  "4904": "What do you require?",
  "4905": "But if in your case some of these imprisoned forces were used, what set them free at the opportune time, or how?",
  "4906": "What do we do now usually in a great battle?",
  "4907": "But can you recognize him?",
  "4908": "Harris?",
  "4909": "What would he say?",

  "4925": "Why should it be she?",
  "4926": "Can a mother speak like that?",
  "4927": "Do you mean to say you've managed to get anybody?",
  "4928": "And how about your luggage?",
  "4929": "You have, then, seen something?",
  "4930": "Would you like to come and see?",
  "4931": "How, then, was she to help herself among the proud and determined nobles of her court?",

  "4950": "What was that for?",
  "4951": "In hand?",
  "4952": "Our establishment interests you?",
  "4953": "Are we in a condition to resent or to repel the aggression?",
  "4954": "Who are some of the others?",
  "4955": "Haven't I striven, striven with all my strength, to find something to give meaning to my life?",
  "4956": "Can you tell me why men believe in all ages and places that there are men and women who cannot die?",
  "4957": "Waited for what?",
  "4958": "And what about him?",
  "4959": "What did you take it for?",

  "4963": "And what would you get as an assistant?",
  "4964": "Shall we consecrate our lives to him that he may hide our life in his life?",
  "4965": "You, monsieur?",
  "4966": "And who will the money go to, doctor?",
  "4967": "All?",
  "4968": "You don't want to live with those people?",
  "4969": "Does my great love mean nothing to you at all?",
  "4970": "Like it?",
  "4971": "And you did not tell the king so?",
  "4972": "Lane?",
  "4973": "From whom did it come else?",
  "4974": "Do you still prefer going away yourself to my leaving you?",
  "4975": "Am I not here?",
  "4976": "Where do you want him?",
  "4977": "Why did I bind myself to her?",

  "4980": "How was she?",
  "4981": "Now about tonight?",
  "4982": "You don't object to an aged parent, I hope?",
  "4983": "You went there in obedience to a letter of instructions?",
  "4984": "Who is he?",
  "4985": "Why do you return so early?",
  "4986": "Lots of tin, I suppose, eh?",
  "4987": "At the anvil?",
  "4988": "Asked him for?",
  "4989": "But what has this to do with the picture?",
  "4990": "What's the matter with you girls?",
  "4991": "Then why do they quarrel?",
  "4992": "Can we then for a moment believe that, if this had been so, tradition would have been absolutely silent on the matter?",

  "5009": "Where are the gloves?",
  "5010": "Really and truly now, you don't mind my doing this?",
  "5011": "Am I to understand that you say you love me?",
  "5012": "Is that clear?",
  "5013": "How be ye?",
  "5014": "Ah, by my crown, what's that?",
  "5015": "Are you glad to see me?",

  "5027": "How long shall they wield unlawful power?",
  "5028": "What do you make of the other?",
  "5029": "In what figure shall I give his heart the first impression?",
  "5030": "Have you knocked at that one?",
  "5031": "Today, this moment?",
  "5032": "Or had he in reality always been like this, commonplace and prosaic, and was it merely in her imagination that he had been wonderful?",
  "5033": "Have you only just come?",
  "5034": "What man?",
  "5035": "Why do the women wear these things?",
  "5036": "Given the laboratories, how are the investigators to be maintained?",

  "5041": "What was the ebb and flow of this tragic meditation?",
  "5042": "Then you want me to go back there?",
  "5043": "But do they do right in ignoring the existence of violence and bloodshed in resistance to constituted authority?",
  "5044": "Harness, but how can I harness everything?",
  "5045": "How cruel is your goodness?",
  "5046": "He's a beauty, isn't he?",
  "5047": "But what good will it do?",
  "5048": "What will protect him?",
  "5049": "How can I be sure of this?",
  "5050": "What's death?",
  "5051": "What was amiss?",
  "5052": "Where are you going to dine then?",

  "5054": "If he could not do it, and if, nevertheless, it behoved them to break off this match, by whom was it to be done if not by her?",
  "5055": "A monkey, then?",
  "5056": "Have you any idea who did?",
  "5057": "Who made the lemonade?",
  "5058": "How shall he stop all the holes and deliver himself from the vipers?",
  "5059": "And why should that particular hole in the ground have anything to do with it?",

  "5065": "What is it that you know?",
  "5066": "Do you not think so?",
  "5067": "Is, then, the crown too heavy that I wear?",
  "5068": "An't I unfortnet enough for you yet?",
  "5069": "Does he want to protect himself, or does he think I would not go alone?",
  "5070": "Has law and order come down to this?",
  "5071": "And have you had a good bonfire up there?",
  "5072": "What is the economical meaning of wages?",
  "5073": "What do we want of a saw?",
  "5074": "Shall I sew, read, cone, draw, or do all at once?",
  "5075": "Why not, my worthy friend?",
  "5076": "How call you the fountain?",
  "5077": "Yea?",
  "5078": "Who would be left?",
  "5079": "And, if so, how far into the future should we look?",
  "5080": "You have seen inside, then?",
  "5081": "And what did I do?",
  "5082": "What good will it do?",
  "5083": "Would you let me fetch another pat of butter, ma'am?",
  "5084": "Can't remember WHAT things?",
  "5085": "Where's some brandy?",
  "5086": "Do you think he'll do it?",
  "5087": "Or will a not fail when he does come?",
  "5088": "Has there been any mistake, has she been buried alive?",
  "5089": "Yes, why was it that he had not married?",
  "5090": "You don't force him?",
  "5091": "Have I not indeed been living in a dream?",
  "5092": "But you, my poor child?",
  "5093": "Who could resist the pleading of so wise and compassionate a judge?",
  "5094": "How long are you staying?",
  "5095": "What on earth is the matter with the boy?",
  "5096": "And why didn't he steal the whole rivière at once, and sell the gems?",

  "5527": "Of money?",
  "5528": "Who will plant the flag on the barricade again?",
  "5529": "Was the fire wholly extinct there?",
  "5530": "Why did you originally go away from me?",
  "5531": "But are not these spirited natures apt to be savage with one another, and with everybody else?",
  "5532": "How did this come about?",
  "5533": "What do I know about arms or supports?",
  "5534": "What does she make a sham for, and pretend to give me money, and take it away again?",
  "5535": "And was this conference arranged beforehand?",
  "5536": "Wherefore should I hold, good fellow?",
  "5537": "What have you done with your fur?",
  "5538": "Is not that true?",
  "5539": "And do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to her daughters, than to us?",
  "5540": "But why must I promise that?",
  "5541": "And what do you know?",
  "5542": "Will you have it so, or will you share your lover's punishment?",
  "5543": "And why on earth does she want to speak to me at all?",
  "5544": "What did you do it for?",
  "5545": "What can I do to serve you?",
  "5546": "What reason had you to strike the man who won my daughter?",
  "5547": "May it not be defined as a period of about twenty years in a woman's life, and thirty in a man's?",
  "5548": "What good is arguments to me?",
  "5549": "And who escapes his lot?",
  "5550": "How is she looking?",
  "5551": "Why so?",
  "5552": "What did he wish for?",
  "5553": "Would she take it as a joke?",
  "5554": "And is she not effectually degraded?",
  "5555": "Final for couples?",
  "5556": "They must be sold, I suppose?",
  "5557": "But what shall I do?",
  "5558": "Who can tell what a dark, dreary, hopeless life I have dragged on for months past?",

  "5560": "What does it matter, after all?",
  "5561": "What is the result of it?",
  "5562": "Did you hear that cry?",
  "5563": "Oh, don't you see?",
  "5564": "Did you ever see such a large peach in all your life?",
  "5565": "How much are you to give him?",
  "5566": "How many?",
  "5567": "Everything as it used to be?",
  "5568": "And how may that be?",
  "5569": "Are you comfortable?",
  "5570": "Can there be a rational adjustment of the claims of each?",

  "5574": "Boys, an't this yer fun?",
  "5575": "Would those stiff trees that had outlived the eagle, turn young and airy pages to him, to skip on his errands when he bade them?",
  "5576": "What is their story?",
  "5577": "At what hour shall we come?",
  "5578": "Have you any tips to give us before we clear out?",
  "5579": "Which is the principal aim of these three?",
  "5580": "That's to you, I suppose, child?",
  "5581": "How must I arrange it, then?",
  "5582": "Is it really?",
  "5583": "Do you want any assistance?",
  "5584": "Yes, and is there a rope handy?",
  "5585": "Do you think it would be good for you?",
  "5586": "Suppose I handed you over to the police?",
  "5587": "And is the art of war one of those arts in which she can or can not share?",

  "5596": "Boys, ma'am?",
  "5597": "Wait a little, if you don't mind, and if you have time to spare?",
  "5598": "Has he asked you to give me the message?",
  "5599": "Some holy book, no doubt?",
  "5600": "Is it possible that one can forget and forsake what he once loved?",
  "5601": "Shall I put myself into the harness to be worn out like an old horse?",
  "5602": "You come from the contractor, you say?",
  "5603": "Why do you do it?",
  "5604": "Am I never to hear the last of this?",
  "5605": "You say that these thirteen millions are found to be wanting in the accounts?",
  "5606": "Then why not admit that these may be replaced some day by other moral intuitions to be evolved in an unknown future?",
  "5607": "What of yourself?",
  "5608": "Can't you now, doctor?",
  "5609": "Surely there must be someone among all of you here who will turn this shameless creature out of the room?",
  "5610": "What on earth is the use of time to a fellow who has twice as much of it as he knows what to do with?",
  "5611": "Or had he found something he wished to keep to himself?",
  "5612": "And how do these wiseacres know that man wants a normal, a virtuous choice?",
  "5613": "Why not furnish an unequivocal explanation of its object?",
  "5614": "Do you see that mainmast there?",
  "5615": "Any letters for me?",
  "5616": "Why are you so upset?",
  "5617": "Have you never felt the romance of that love?",
  "5618": "An explanation, pray, of what?",
  "5619": "And how on earth do they get at it?",
  "5620": "Do they get you bairns?",
  "5621": "Cannot one find friends among the animals, and choose some tame kid or eloquent parrot or amiable monkey?",
  "5622": "You wish to exchange crosses?",
  "5623": "Well, and did you like it very much?",
  "5624": "Would you mind describing him to me?",
  "5625": "But do you understand the mission you are fulfilling?",
  "5626": "What do YOU mean, mother?",
  "5627": "How about accidents?",
  "5628": "Do you think this is the end?",
  "5629": "Doing well, I suppose?",
  "5630": "Where 'bouts do you live?",
  "5631": "And then, mother?",
  "5632": "Do you sometimes think that I took an unfair advantage of your weakness?",
  "5633": "In what way did you mean it, sir?",
  "5634": "What did the gentleman say to her, my sonny?",
  "5635": "Did he name no one in his passion?",
  "5636": "What kind of political ambition was to result from this destructive political education?",
  "5637": "He knows them, then?",
  "5638": "Could narrow passages spread from it through the foundations of the island?",
  "5639": "Suppose we were to meet any of them?",
  "5640": "Have you anything?",
  "5641": "And what is the cause of this?",
  "5642": "Or flatter sorry bunglers?",
  "5643": "By my orders?",
  "5644": "So you do not plead guilty?",
  "5645": "Now, are not you fancying, gentlemen, that I am expressing remorse for something now, that I am asking your forgiveness for something?",
  "5646": "Would a man grow weary of such a look turned on him, of such arms held out?",
  "5647": "Why does she give me notice when it's too late?",
  "5648": "I suppose they'll take her back, won't they?",
  "5649": "D'ye know anything of it?",
  "5650": "Why then do we not follow his example, doing as he did in the countries through which we pass?",

  "5657": "You think it would?",
  "5658": "Are you having a good time?",
  "5659": "Have you heard this?",
  "5660": "Why, where have you been?",
  "5661": "But now who will relieve me of the dread?",
  "5662": "Have the which?",
  "5663": "Why don't you snap your oars, you rascals?",
  "5664": "Is it not obvious?",
  "5665": "Why did you come to tell me yourself, instead of sending my man?",
  "5666": "Holidays?",
  "5667": "I mean did you see the statue fall?",
  "5668": "And she refused you as she says?",
  "5669": "Father went away to give us children room, didn't he?",
  "5670": "Durbeyfield?",
  "5671": "Can I see the letter?",
  "5672": "In what then, pray, shall I obey you?",
  "5673": "Why should you make a principle out of what you yourselves are, and must be?",
  "5674": "Why should we imagine that the precious metals are likely to do so?",
  "5675": "And what did he answer?",
  "5676": "What IS the matter?",
  "5677": "Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?",
  "5678": "What could he say to her now, after all he had said formerly, when he held her hands as he kissed her hair beside her cheeks?",
  "5679": "No female nurses?",
  "5680": "How did you happen to think of it?",
  "5681": "Where, then, is the power of your wealthy man?",
  "5682": "And what can I do but obey their commands?",
  "5683": "Would it, indeed, have been better if we had loved each other as a boy and a girl, and forgotten it?",
  "5684": "What social and political rights have women?",
  "5685": "And are they arrested?",
  "5686": "Puffs?",
  "5687": "Didn't they denounce the fenian movement from the pulpit and in the confession box?",
  "5688": "Isn't it time to skim it, my dear?",
  "5689": "Where do they come from, then?",
  "5690": "Marriage?",
  "5691": "Now, sir, why are you late again, as usual?",
  "5692": "Might anybody ask what their brother has been saying?",
  "5693": "Well, my children, what is going on now?",
  "5694": "What death?",
  "5695": "To what party did he belong?",
  "5696": "Does that suggest nothing to you?",
  "5697": "Where away?",
  "5698": "How did you penetrate hither?",
  "5699": "Caught cold in the grottos, at night, perhaps?",
  "5700": "You are sure?",
  "5701": "Well, and what did the last one say to ye?",
  "5702": "Did you come in the gig?",
  "5703": "And the DISENCHANTMENT of woman is in progress?",

  "5706": "Breakfast?",
  "5707": "Now what does this imply?",
  "5708": "What possessed him to turn listener?",
  "5709": "Is this not a quite unusual politeness?",
  "5710": "Whatever have you done now?",
  "5711": "Are these things nothing?",
  "5712": "Did my sons get power and money?",
  "5713": "If they are such a happy class of people, how was it that you had such a time of punishing and hanging them within the last two years?",
  "5714": "And I have no doubt she loves you like a brother?",
  "5715": "And what have you been thinking about THEM, my busy bee?",
  "5716": "But how will it be?",
  "5717": "Could anything exceed the picture he gives one of scientific ardour?",
  "5718": "There is no exit that way?",
  "5719": "But was he worse?",
  "5720": "Yet how long before it was unsettled again?",
  "5721": "Philanthropy's sake?",
  "5722": "Or are they late because they have had a lovers' meeting?",
  "5723": "Is he very ill?",
  "5724": "Did he know them before?",
  "5725": "Cranly asked softly, happier than you are now, for instance?",
  "5726": "Why, what on earth does she do here?",
  "5727": "What does it matter to me whether the prince is to be what the late king was?",
  "5728": "Didn't I tell you now, mum, as it 'ud hurt your feelings to look at my pack?",
  "5729": "How can I urge my daughters now to go and raise large families?",
  "5730": "And what did it matter?",
  "5731": "What are you meddling with, stupid?",
  "5732": "Why do you specify the fox?",
  "5733": "Who said that?",
  "5734": "But you have found out something for yourself?",
  "5735": "Well, what if I could?",
  "5736": "Did you bet?",
  "5737": "Are you not weary of that stupid, meaningless, constantly repeated fraud?",
  "5738": "I say, you're not putting off a party tonight, are you?",
  "5739": "Well, then, what'll we make him the ink out of?",
  "5740": "But, bishop, the question is, who has the power to settle it?",
  "5741": "Don't you trust me?",
  "5742": "What does friendship mean if it not so?",
  "5743": "Well, what time for repayment do you wish me to take?",
  "5744": "Whuzzis?",
  "5745": "Why is the hawk so hated by birds?",
  "5746": "About measures, or rhythms, or verses?",

  "5748": "Do you know where I shall find him?",
  "5749": "I sprung out of bed, and asked, what wreck?",
  "5750": "Are you sure this time?",
  "5751": "Would he have drawn back?",
  "5752": "Had ever a queen such a throne before?",
  "5753": "And what do YOU want?",
  "5754": "Or was he a debtor or a debtor's son?",
  "5755": "Not quite so far, I hope?",
  "5756": "You are not angry with me?",
  "5757": "For what is maintenance?",
  "5758": "What will you?",
  "5759": "What does this mean?",
  "5760": "Go whither?",
  "5761": "Does he not set me at defiance?",
  "5762": "But, after the ball, why had he not returned?",
  "5763": "And where did you hear it?",
  "5764": "What the devil could that handkerchief signify?",
  "5765": "What data could he expect from an uncleaned watch?",
  "5766": "But what is all this about?",
  "5767": "Can't we come?",
  "5768": "And destroy their lives, when they've helped me to remake mine?",
  "5769": "But need we fear anything beyond a momentary anger?",
  "5770": "And which are these two sorts?",
  "5771": "Don't you feel as if you just loved the world on a morning like this?",
  "5772": "To drink?",
  "5773": "What shall we do, then, to push this great war of freedom and justice to its righteous conclusion?",
  "5774": "Will you get the mail, dear?",
  "5775": "Yes, very noble?",
  "5776": "Do you know where I am leading you?",
  "5777": "Did we notify them of this sage view of ours when we borrowed their money?",
  "5778": "Why did you form a monster so hideous that even YOU turned from me in disgust?",
  "5779": "Atone for a fault by paying money?",
  "5780": "How can you build on such a quicksand?",
  "5781": "Is that cough of his better?",
  "5782": "Why does he not look at me?",
  "5783": "From what house does the young noble come?",
  "5784": "But now how stands the wind?",
  "5785": "You promise me that frankness?",
  "5786": "And are you building?",
  "5787": "Would his uncle give him a place in the bank?",
  "5788": "Hearken to me, will you?",
  "5789": "What do you think, would they give us anything for it?",
  "5790": "Do you not know?",
  "5791": "How far does one of these little revolvers carry?",
  "5792": "Shall I seal the door?",
  "5793": "What did you take her?",
  "5794": "Yea, and what work, king's daughter?",
  "5795": "You're going to keep open the proposition, so to speak?",
  "5796": "How long will the air in the reservoirs last for us to breathe on board?",
  "5797": "What have you to offer to me, my friend?",
  "5798": "Why say ye so?",
  "5799": "No doubt you felt this yourself?",
  "5800": "Would he take her back to the beach or would he keep her here?",
  "5801": "Coom, wakken oop, will 'ee?",
  "5802": "And that principle which repels the musical, or the just?",
  "5803": "Why had he withheld life from her?",
  "5804": "And that isn't much, is it?",
  "5805": "Is life grievous to you?",
  "5806": "And are we to be carried on far and away into remote distance, and never, never to return?",
  "5807": "Why do you speak so?",
  "5808": "As for what you do me the honor to say, I presume you mean I was afraid?",
  "5809": "So, why not accept these sports as legitimate expressions of a normal and wholesome human nature?",
  "5810": "Whose camp are you in, those who bless or those who curse?",
  "5811": "Is it my mother?",
  "5812": "What is your opinion of it?",
  "5813": "How in the world did you deduce that?",
  "5814": "Now guess what the young one did?",
  "5815": "What money is there to be made here in any other way?",
  "5816": "But suppose she does come there?",
  "5817": "And was this not to be obtained?",
  "5818": "Your reason, your reason for this?",
  "5819": "And silent all?",
  "5820": "What keeps them dancing till five o'clock in the morning through a whole mortal season?",
  "5821": "What can it be, then?",
  "5822": "Are you aware what you are saying, my lord?",
  "5823": "So much per man?",
  "5824": "What made you go away with him?",
  "5825": "Will all things be set right in the nation?",
  "5826": "Have you informed him of it?",
  "5827": "Don't we all know that it must be a match, that they were over head and ears in love with each other from the first moment they met?",
  "5828": "What is this vessel?",
  "5829": "Would you venture to so consider them had they been committed by any nation on earth against the humblest of our people?",
  "5830": "He?",
  "5831": "But who had made her tell it?",
  "5832": "To get her out of my bride's way, who might otherwise walk over her rather too emphatically?",
  "5833": "What is the best way of living for us monks?",
  "5834": "Was that the reason why you quitted the service, monsieur le chevalier?",
  "5835": "Where were you meaning to spend the evening?",
  "5836": "Come at last where your duty calls you, eh?",
  "5837": "Who will push a drum hither for me?",
  "5838": "Who has a right to strike her dead?",
  "5839": "Could it be well that she should sacrifice the happiness of two persons to a theoretic love of pure blood?",
  "5840": "She ses to me she ses 'can you show me all them places?",
  "5841": "But how is it that you know so much of these matters?",
  "5842": "Isn't he funny?",
  "5843": "And what is the faculty in man to which imitation is addressed?",
  "5844": "But where do you come from not to know what every coachman in the town knows?",
  "5845": "What is that pain like?",
  "5846": "Drop me in the park, will you?",
  "5847": "When do you wish the carriage to be here?",
  "5848": "Any one dead?",
  "5849": "Have you lost it?",
  "5850": "Isn't that a question for consideration?",
  "5851": "Am I not thy loving father?",
  "5852": "But if you have a genius for painting, would it not be right to take that as a guide?",
  "5853": "PISTHETAERUS D'you see?",
  "5854": "Is that the question?",
  "5855": "A philosopher, perhaps?",
  "5856": "Is it likely?",
  "5857": "May I count upon your assistance?",
  "5858": "Are the eggs nice?",
  "5859": "Of tea with me over the fire?",
  "5860": "And now, my friend, as you cannot come to me, may I come to you?",
  "5861": "Why not today?",
  "5862": "What?",
  "5863": "Will you render me a little help?",
  "5864": "Are you scoffing at me?",
  "5865": "How do you suppose I managed when you were away?",
  "5866": "Is it so, or is it not so?",
  "5867": "If he could mollify the lioness with such a sop, how happy would he think his first efforts had been?",
  "5868": "And are you nervous?",
  "5869": "Do you say no?",
  "5870": "And why may we not continue that ratio far beyond that period?",
  "5871": "In the churchyard?",
  "5872": "And how so, if you please?",
  "5873": "Abdicated?",
  "5874": "Why tell all that?",
  "5875": "And with regard to us, how were you placed?",
  "5876": "Then where is he gone?",
  "5877": "Think of you?",
  "5878": "Or did I only imagine that you did?",
  "5879": "Yet what do we have but words?",
  "5880": "Is't not simply the best that ever you heard, captain?",
  "5881": "Is there any ground for all these questions, or not?",
  "5882": "Linton, don't you recall your cousin, that you used to tease us so with wishing to see?",
  "5883": "Can you satisfy us of that?",
  "5884": "And where does he live?",
  "5885": "If his beauty allures my eyes, and my eyes listen to the call, shall I say that I love him just for that?",
  "5886": "How shall I call her?",
  "5887": "Is that where you belong?",
  "5888": "What child?",
  "5889": "And whence and whither is it now?",

  "5891": "You wrote it?",
  "5892": "What's the old man have so much to do with him for?",
  "5893": "A daughter, I suppose?",
  "5894": "What have you said to your father about all this?",
  "5895": "Is he grateful?",

  "5904": "Would they not?",
  "5905": "Would you like to write and tell her so?",
  "5906": "Are you not too much shut up?",
  "5907": "Who is't?",
  "5908": "What do you think of the other?",
  "5909": "To go where?",
  "5910": "Was this done on purpose?",
  "5911": "Could she have guessed?",
  "5912": "What course shall we pursue?",
  "5913": "But is it best?",
  "5914": "Then you won't do as I ask you?",
  "5915": "How did you open it before?",
  "5916": "Very sad, is it not?",
  "5917": "Mother, can't you see her?",
  "5918": "What is there in this world more melancholy than such a dinner?",
  "5919": "Why so?",

  "5932": "Frank, do you wish to see me die of a broken heart?",
  "5933": "From my letter?",
  "5934": "But what should he say in his report?",
  "5935": "What are your intentions regarding the girl?",
  "5936": "What, you've been in the room quite a time?",
  "5937": "Were they expelled from society on his account?",
  "5938": "Will you oblige me by confiding it?",

  "6359": "If that be so, do you see what, on the other hand, is involved in it?",
  "6360": "But have you any grave doubts on the subject?",
  "6361": "And for what were our shields intended?",
  "6362": "How much do you suppose he possesses?",
  "6363": "And is it not?",
  "6364": "Is your sword bewitched, or under the influence of some imperial charm?",
  "6365": "Sister must have taken her, or else where can she be?",
  "6366": "What the deuce are you doing here?",
  "6367": "And old age?",
  "6368": "Would you like to see him?",
  "6369": "Shall I meet other wayfarers at night?",
  "6370": "Scratch you out of her will, I think you mean?",
  "6371": "Have you ever heard that name?",
  "6372": "Don't you see that a single kite could easily carry off the lot at once?",
  "6373": "Why don't you come away?",
  "6374": "Now which is most honourable, the air or the earth?",
  "6375": "What wear they on their feet?",
  "6376": "How much have you?",
  "6377": "You feel sleepy, don't you, my dear?",
  "6378": "What are you doing out at this time of night?",
  "6379": "Another cloud?",
  "6380": "Can I lift my arm?",
  "6381": "Five?",
  "6382": "Keep your toe in your pump, will you?",
  "6383": "Who can require it?",
  "6384": "Didn't I give him that name?",
  "6385": "Well, won't you help me to get at the people?",
  "6386": "Mercy on us, what's all this?",
  "6387": "But how should she manage?",
  "6388": "And you?",
  "6389": "Who had given him that key?",
  "6390": "Why should I stop here, my dears?",
  "6391": "Who but a fool would take his left hand by his right, and say to himself, how d'ye do?",
  "6392": "Am I to read it now?",
  "6393": "What is the early rising for, dear heart?",
  "6394": "What is she like then, pretty?",
  "6395": "Will that be enough?",
  "6396": "How, then, could we decide whether we had reached the pole?",
  "6397": "Well, I don't say no, do I?",
  "6398": "What may be thy name, lad?",
  "6399": "What if she were suddenly to burst out laughing, what should I do then?",

  "6408": "Has she given you that as a reason?",
  "6409": "What bitter sight have you seen to make you feel such bitterness?",
  "6410": "I come to you, my leader, my head, my father, and I ask you, master, are you contented with me?",
  "6411": "What can authorize him to draw any such inference?",
  "6412": "What have you learnt of her history?",
  "6413": "Why be so upset?",
  "6414": "Isn't there anybody else?",
  "6415": "What is he writing to you about?",

  "6422": "How does the question of my love come in?",
  "6423": "I ask you whether you will go?",
  "6424": "Would you like to be arrested as his accomplice?",
  "6425": "By whom?",
  "6426": "And what are you doing now?",
  "6427": "What o' devil has he swallowed?",
  "6428": "So you won't let me have him, gen'l'men?",
  "6429": "What good has it done me to mourn for you eternally in the secret recesses of my heart?",
  "6430": "Do you fear he will not understand?",
  "6431": "Why should I bestow all my tediousness upon you, because I have you in my power, and have ink, paper, and time before me?",
  "6432": "But may not there be some occasions, where this may be a little dispensed with?",
  "6433": "My fault, my heart's joy?",
  "6434": "What chance have we now to overtake or even to trace it?",
  "6435": "But who, in sooth, could resist a freshly broiled venison streak eaten out in the open air to the tune of jest and good fellowship?",
  "6436": "Why should one halt on the way?",
  "6437": "Jellyband?",
  "6438": "And can't it be helped?",
  "6439": "Have you?",
  "6440": "Is not that a falsehood?",
  "6441": "I suppose you despise me dreadfully, prince, eh?",
  "6442": "What more does the position admit of?",
  "6443": "Expect to get anything by this evidence?",
  "6444": "How would you like to have it?",
  "6445": "Why does it keep coming up against you in your mind?",
  "6446": "And did not their defeat precipitate the fall of the city?",
  "6447": "Where did he come from?",
  "6448": "What shall become of us at the end, if at the beginning we are lukewarm and idle?",

  "6450": "Emilie?",
  "6451": "Whence arose thy writhing entrails?",
  "6452": "And if her father doubted her a little, would not neighbours and acquaintance doubt her much?",
  "6453": "What the hell do you know about it?",
  "6454": "And you saw no more of him?",
  "6455": "What on earth is this?",
  "6456": "Was there anything to be learnt from this fine sentence?",
  "6457": "Children dear, was it yesterday?",
  "6458": "Which they deserve, do they not?",
  "6459": "Well, what about my plan?",
  "6460": "And there is no difficulty, he said, in assigning to all of them places answering to their several natures and propensities?",
  "6461": "Are you happy now, you foolish boy?",
  "6462": "Shall we continue to raise our eyes to heaven?",
  "6463": "Now, in what consists the correlation between USEFUL value and value in EXCHANGE?",
  "6464": "Why, madam, think you to mock me thus palpably?",
  "6465": "Are you going so soon?",
  "6466": "I say, is it true that we have been beaten?",
  "6467": "What is the matter with me?",
  "6468": "Do you know where he is?",
  "6469": "Don't I know my man?",
  "6470": "What gentleman?",
  "6471": "And on this oddness, of which the number three has the impress, the opposite idea will never intrude?",
  "6472": "What now?",
  "6473": "Have you gone mad, my dear friend?",
  "6474": "And, if it has no proper place of its own, like the earth, in the midst of its elements, why does it not fall to the centre of our elements?",
  "6475": "Who did the deed?",
  "6476": "Forward, my brave cuirassiers?",
  "6477": "What lack you from us?",
  "6478": "Canst not bide still an instant?",
  "6479": "You know what there is in the letter, father?",
  "6480": "You don't mean honestly she said that?",
  "6481": "Who gave you permission, monsieur to fathom my designs, or to reckon with me?",
  "6482": "But where does the connection come in?",
  "6483": "Put him up?",
  "6484": "By what authority does he declare all this meritless?",

  "6486": "And what is their temper now?",
  "6487": "Emeralds?",
  "6488": "But how now?",
  "6489": "Do I know that photograph?",
  "6490": "How then shall I be able to find you, when the day of payment comes?",
  "6491": "Who is there to tell that I am the murderer?",

  "6495": "You're quite strong now?",
  "6496": "And the paper on the walls?",
  "6497": "Send for you at this time of night?",
  "6498": "Is it far?",
  "6499": "Have you the money he demands?",
  "6500": "You wouldn't think so to look at me, would you?",
  "6501": "Fie, fie, nephew, you would not pull off your boots here?",
  "6502": "Why should we be more fastidious and severe than they were?",
  "6503": "What you been doing down there?",

  "6508": "And leave the east end to starve?",
  "6509": "Everything cackleth, but who will still sit quietly on the nest and hatch eggs?",
  "6510": "How can I join in?",
  "6511": "What time did it appear?",
  "6512": "What bark?",
  "6513": "You don't mean as the crooks have got her?",
  "6514": "What is the meaning of it all?",
  "6515": "And what excuse did she give you for entering all alone?",
  "6516": "Besides, what use was my hair to me?",
  "6517": "What CAN I do?",
  "6518": "Now, sire, what shall I do with respect to the finances?",
  "6519": "But if the bridge is crossed it means that the army too is lost?",

  "6527": "That's a good sign, isn't it?",
  "6528": "But don't you think that's very wicked?",
  "6529": "By the way, how long do you think this war will last?",
  "6530": "What shall I say, my dear father and mother, to this unexpected declaration?",
  "6531": "YOU'LL bring your threats here, will you?",
  "6532": "And would you rather die, than obey your father?",
  "6533": "Going to?",
  "6534": "To hang your hat on?",
  "6535": "Whom have I the honour to address?",
  "6536": "And what will you do?",

  "6545": "Do you think it's a refuge for fools?",
  "6546": "Was he, after all, to be just a moment too late?",
  "6547": "You are simply repeating all you said in your letter, and what's the use?",
  "6548": "Or, will you not stay and forget what you have said?",
  "6549": "You mean that he has a great income and that he must earn it in an illegal fashion?",
  "6550": "Oh, did he?",
  "6551": "Do you call me a fool?",
  "6552": "You think that he is dead?",
  "6553": "Who shall settle the terms of peace, and in case of disputes what umpire shall decide between them and compel acquiescence?",
  "6554": "Is this the decanter you spoke of?",
  "6555": "Arrested him?",

  "6569": "Why is it not done already?",
  "6570": "And you conspire with him against me, do you, viper?",
  "6571": "But what can I make her about herself?",
  "6572": "A peerage in her own right?",
  "6573": "What happiness can you give her as your wife?",
  "6574": "And a man will be most likely to care about that which he loves?",
  "6575": "What about it, eh?",
  "6576": "Are you drunk or mad, my masters?",
  "6577": "What do you mean by not saying anything instead of taking my part?",
  "6578": "Was he not simply another of the countless wild things of the jungle who preyed upon one another to satisfy the cravings of hunger?",
  "6579": "Supposing, after all, she's escaped?",
  "6580": "You recollect perfectly all I have told you, do you not?",
  "6581": "Didn't I tell you to insist on having a proper advocate?",
  "6582": "You, then, who put your hands to the work, who alone truly create, why do you wish me to admit your inferiority?",
  "6583": "Don't the cards tell you, that he is dead?",
  "6584": "Then why doesn't she choose, when I tell her of what consequence it is?",
  "6585": "But if he is innocent, who has done it?",
  "6586": "A religious book, uncle?",
  "6587": "Shall you come again, doctor?",
  "6588": "It wouldn't be nice to have something wrong in your upper story, would it, teacher?",
  "6589": "What, with the baroness?",
  "6590": "How did you come to separate yourself from the pigs and chickens?",
  "6591": "Is it because there is a difference in size?",

  "6607": "Have you more than one clerk, you parrot, that you ask the question?",
  "6608": "Is't not strange?",
  "6609": "And that's your notion of harshness?",
  "6610": "Have you breakfasted?",
  "6611": "Will you not come with me?",
  "6612": "Dine together?",
  "6613": "Are not all these things evident proofs of a fixed and uniform plan to tax us?",
  "6614": "Would he send that out and have his men take it as the truth?",
  "6615": "But tell me, why do the people admire me?",
  "6616": "What perverted genius controls this awful secret movement?",
  "6617": "May I look?",

  "6624": "And you would have married her?",
  "6625": "WILL IT HIT US?",
  "6626": "Is it an ill expression?",
  "6627": "Will it satisfy them if, in the future, we have nothing to do with invasions and, insurrections?",
  "6628": "Will you wait for me and we can lunch somewhere together?",
  "6629": "Why do you laugh?",
  "6630": "Could his mind then not trust itself?",
  "6631": "Now what ought I to do?",
  "6632": "Are there not as many prizes as there are competitors?",
  "6633": "The same man as the preacher?",

  "6648": "He saw me, did he, the rascal?",
  "6649": "Whose latter days had ever been more blessed than his?",
  "6650": "What did they say to each other?",
  "6651": "Has your experience been as a practitioner, or rather as an investigator of medicine as a science?",
  "6652": "How many of us are there?",
  "6653": "Do you know how he died?",
  "6654": "And when shall we get there?",
  "6655": "Will you or will you not answer for your unmanly and brutal conduct?",
  "6656": "Of what country am I?",
  "6657": "Who is the man over there?",
  "6658": "Do you call it very bad?",
  "6659": "Where did she come from?",
  "6660": "Why are you smiling?",
  "6661": "Is this the lane?",
  "6662": "And yet, I wonder whether there was not a little feeling of melancholy in the midst of all our joy?",
  "6663": "Are you alone?",
  "6664": "Was it water?",
  "6665": "Is it fraudulent to aromatize, alcoholize, and water wines?",

  "6673": "But who can say what that limit will be?",
  "6674": "You can't mean to go yet?",
  "6675": "Father, what do you want me to do with it?",
  "6676": "Where am I to go?",

  "6684": "What, even for me?",
  "6685": "Who is this young butcher?",
  "6686": "How is this possible?",
  "6687": "And is this confined to the sight only, or does it extend to the hearing also, relating in fact to what we term poetry?",

  "6703": "About jam?",
  "6704": "So you can see that there was a 'scene,' can you?",
  "6705": "You are positive?",
  "6706": "Why, then, has society recognized a right injurious to itself, where there is no producing cause?",

  "7033": "You've not done right, have you, now?",
  "7034": "Do you hear me, you fairy spirit?",
  "7035": "Is history to be written from such documents?",
  "7036": "Is what this paper says, the truth?",
  "7037": "And can you forget so soon what I proposed to you the other night?",
  "7038": "But, madame, what can he do, unless he has a kingdom to back him?",
  "7039": "Where was my son?",
  "7040": "But does not the present case fairly constitute an exception?",
  "7041": "English money?",

  "8207": "By after 'all' you mean after she's in love with somebody else?",
  "8208": "Did you ever see such a den, my dear?",
  "8209": "Yet why are those names disgraceful?",
  "8210": "Not damn the sharper, but the dice?",
  "8211": "And what IS her idea?",
  "8212": "Do you feel inclined to make the monks' acquaintance once more?",
  "8213": "Why don't you wish to come back home?",

  "8274": "How did you begin?",
  "8275": "When I heard her dismiss the footman, I stepped up to him and asked him, what little lady that was?",
  "8276": "You may ask, by what authority do I venture, being a person not concerned in the practice of medicine, to meddle with that subject?",
  "8277": "And what do you wonder?",
  "8278": "So I's to gouge out all their eyes, eh?",
  "8279": "What was it about?",
  "8280": "And the hyperbola?",
  "8281": "And in what city did you live?",
  "8282": "Are you not ashamed to speak to a wretch lying on the stones?",
  "8283": "Can I do anything for you?",
  "8284": "Yet how many people have I hated in my life?",
  "8285": "Will you take a chair?",
  "8286": "And straightway hereupon, arose the natural question of cui bono?",

  "9536": "What, my precious?",
  "9537": "Asleep?",
  "9538": "Surely it is better for you to take the substantial sum which I offer than to ruin this woman's career, which can profit you in no way?",
  "9539": "What mean you, man?",
  "9540": "Yet, who knows how long you'll be a stranger?",
  "9541": "That head I see now on your shoulders?",
  "9542": "And how well he looks on his horse, eh?",
  "9543": "From what quarter can the danger proceed?",
  "9544": "Then why talk about seeing me through at all?",

  "9552": "You don't happen to know any good of him, do you?",
  "9553": "Can't you keep it quiet?",
  "9554": "It is, then, somebody's head that you demand of me?",
  "9555": "But why so full of these fears and anxieties?",
  "9556": "What is, in its essence, this excellence or perfection of which we have more shining evidence as we go up in the scale?",

  "9631": "Shall I injure him because he wants to do me a service?",
  "9632": "Will you begin with this one?",
  "9633": "What could I do?",
  "9634": "But why should our poor creatures be deprived of so much nourishment?",
  "9635": "What right have you to call yourself so?",

  "11357": "Do you lock yourself up from me, to make my search more curious?",
  "11358": "Was it possible to make a fool of a man, of a worthy man, because his father had left him a little money?",
  "11359": "And a choice of what?",
  "11360": "Are you all right here?",
  "11361": "But what were these fatigues, what did the wounds matter?",
  "11362": "My business?",
  "11363": "What else do you hear?",
  "11364": "Not worth speaking of?",

  "11394": "Could it pluck out a single hair of thy head?",
  "11395": "Or had you rather forfeit your kingdom, your treasures, and your life?",
  "11396": "How are you going to manage that, captain?",
  "11397": "Did she stand the journey well?",
  "11398": "Oh, he won't speak out, won't he?",
  "11399": "What's it to be?",
  "11400": "Or don't you want to tell it me?",
  "11401": "What business had she to go away?",
  "11402": "Why poor?",
  "11403": "But it had not approached the body?",

  "11426": "What is your name, boy?",
  "11427": "But, sir, are you sure he is as guilty as they say?",
  "11428": "From where does she hail?",
  "11429": "Further, I said, has not a drunken man also the spirit of a tyrant?",

  "11490": "Go away with you?",
  "11491": "This is not your writing?",
  "11492": "For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?",
  "11493": "Who told me to love her?",
  "11494": "And is that all you can say for him?",
  "11495": "Do you think it would be worth a week's wages?",

  "11527": "Anything moving in the old place, mid I ask?",
  "11528": "Are you going to leave me?",
  "11529": "Surely you are mistaken about his trade?",
  "11530": "Can this be it?",
  "11531": "Lemonade, sir?",
  "11532": "Have I not shown my power?",

  "11556": "Have ye nae sense o' your manhood, young gentlemen, that for a mad gossip ower the wine ye wend into the dark to cut each other's throats?",
  "11557": "A cheerful sight, aren't they?",
  "11558": "But, it will be asked, what kind of a treasure is this that we propose to bequeath to posterity?",
  "11559": "How do you get at that?",
  "11560": "Frank?",
  "11561": "Are you strong enough?",
  "11562": "Now, I want to hear you swear that you are not married to that woman?",
  "11563": "You don't mind obliging me?",

  "11575": "Or is it by the law courts and the judge?",
  "11576": "Whom had we to deal with?",
  "11577": "Why don't you say you'd have a splendid, wise, good husband and some angelic little children?",
  "11578": "And yet there was one thing wanting in order to complete your happiness?",
  "11579": "I hope there's nothing wrong?",
  "11580": "Have the private emotions also their gutter press?",
  "11581": "Yes, but how came you here again?",
  "11582": "Do you think there is a single person in the county who will not know that his doing is a sign that he has quarrelled with me?",
  "11583": "Are your doubts on that point too strong?",
  "11584": "Who you gwine to take to jail now?",

  "12765": "PIGS' TEETH?",
  "12766": "And what is the result of your investigations?",
  "12767": "Not a word of reproach?",
  "12768": "And, if not, whence arises this culpability peculiar to man?",
  "12769": "But how?",
  "12770": "Was this difficult?",
  "12771": "Then I can still count on your support?",
  "12772": "Does it mean that it's the real thing?",
  "12773": "Who has his letters?",
  "12774": "Ay, are you howling, you wolf?",
  "12775": "Did I?",

  "12781": "Whoever comes here has to walk single file between those two rocks, in fair range of your pistols, boys, d'ye see?",
  "12782": "How do I know whether or no I'm a gentleman myself?",
  "12783": "What art is that?",
  "12784": "And will he then change himself for the better and fairer, or for the worse and more unsightly?",
  "12785": "And what is the whole history?",
  "12786": "The noose, sir?",
  "12787": "Said I, and how, my lad?",
  "12788": "And how did you get your clue?",
  "12789": "What is the matter with you?",
  "12790": "How should they?",
  "12791": "Whatever's the matter now?",
  "12792": "Is it illusion or fear?",

  "12805": "How do you do, my dear boy?",
  "12806": "I'll go up onto the knoll if I may?",
  "12807": "And why doesn't he die, I should like to know?",
  "12808": "And did they repeat what you said?",
  "12809": "Why do you conceal your necessities from me?",
  "12810": "And how do YOU know that he left two million and a half of roubles?",
  "12811": "Do you know if the marriage settlement he promised me has come?",
  "12812": "Now, I ask, why was all this done, but from that extremely weak and expensive doctrine, that the country could not bear it?",
  "12813": "Don't I?",
  "12814": "Sturgis?",
  "12815": "And where mought you have come from?",

  "12826": "It was certain that the settlers would end by reinstating themselves in their domicile and driving out the intruders, but when and how?",
  "12827": "Took away?",
  "12828": "Does that mean you won't pay for it after having told me I could get it?",
  "12829": "Shall I bring him to you?",
  "12830": "Why did you leave the steak to fry, and the ale to run, and then spoil all the meal?",

  "12832": "And what will she do now?",
  "12833": "Worse news of what, of whom?",
  "12834": "How could it have been possible?",
  "12835": "Is it an illusion?",
  "12836": "With whom have I the honour?",
  "12837": "Do you know that profound thinker?",
  "12838": "To whom does this island belong?",
  "12839": "Isn't that rather a large order?",
  "12840": "The bourgeoisie?",
  "12841": "And what?",
  "12842": "What do I stay here then?",
  "12843": "Is there to be no limit, no end to the injustice we heap upon this unfortunate people?",

  "13743": "What on earth are you crying for now?",
  "13744": "Then why does that chattering magpie tell such lies to a woman?",
  "13745": "But you yourself were the person who suggested that?",
  "13746": "Perhaps you can account also for the bullet which has so obviously struck the edge of the window?",

  "13759": "And how is our patient?",
  "13760": "Was there any chance of escaping from the fury of this impetuous torrent, and of returning to the surface of the globe?",
  "13761": "Then what have you to say of me?",
  "13762": "What, still keeping up this silly jest?",
  "13763": "Shall we take our valets?",

  "13812": "My remark is not then original?",
  "13813": "But where is he taking us to?",
  "13814": "Haven't we tried that before now, and what ever came of it?",
  "13815": "And you will stay with me?",

  "13967": "And you are not offended?",
  "13968": "Is it for the innocent child?",
  "13969": "I wonder why it is that to lie securely in bed, with the light out, seems ever the same place, wherever in space one may chance to be?",
  "13970": "How the better?",
  "13971": "That's not much, is it?",
  "13972": "Where is the chief of the cohort?",

  "14112": "And could he take a foundling to his heart?",
  "14113": "Why should he doubt it?",
  "14114": "What have YOU got to do with it, then, if a person may inquire?",
  "14115": "And you can't say I've not been awfully good, can you?",
  "14116": "And the opinion of the inquisitors?",
  "14117": "Why so many to be low and so few to be high?",
  "14118": "But what is there in running across it like that?",

  "14135": "I cry in my sleep where is he?",
  "14136": "Can you explain to me what signify this leave of absence and this letter, which I have just received?",
  "14137": "Did he begin to waver under the delusion of a breath of adventure?",
  "14138": "What party, then, shall we choose among these difficulties?",
  "14139": "How unfortnet do you want me fur to be?",
  "14140": "And it is not pleasant?",

  "14221": "What is it all?",
  "14222": "You are fond of gardening?",
  "14223": "But what does that matter?",
  "14224": "Where are they hiding?",
  "14225": "You would not be inclined to say, would you, that navigation is the art of medicine, at least if we are to adopt your exact use of language?",
  "14226": "What would the dear man have?",
  "14227": "Why should we ignore it now?",
  "14228": "Ye flee from me?",
  "14229": "And didn't I hear your message?",
  "14230": "But what if he should suffer the radish through obeying you, and be depillated with hot ashes?",
  "14231": "But where is the compass?",
  "14232": "And if the influence went with him into the tent, whose was it?",
  "14233": "Aren't we going too much to the left?",

  "14235": "That's it, hey?",
  "14236": "Falsehoods?",
  "14237": "But tell me, how do the peasants look at it?",

  "14239": "What have you just been saying, my friend?",
  "14240": "Can you tell us where he is?",
  "14241": "What is there to keep them together?",
  "14242": "A what?",
  "14243": "Do you suppose I don't see how you are suffering, how this has torn open your wounds?",
  "14244": "Is it just that she shall leave and pay no part of this herself?",
  "14245": "Do you mean I've been your victim?",
  "14246": "Wrong?",
  "14247": "What's that sir?",
  "14248": "Or while I continue to work at my picture, which will certainly never get finished?",
  "14249": "She has some recent association with the number twelve?",
  "14250": "This wound?",
  "14251": "But not all of it?",
  "14252": "How on earth can I dress up like that?",
  "14253": "So, you did see him when he was talking to you at the table?",
  "14254": "Was ever such a sneaking varmint?",
  "14255": "Is he gentle, father?",
  "14256": "What am I to tell you?",
  "14257": "You do not eat?",
  "14258": "Isn't the whole course of life made up of such?",
  "14259": "He was allying himself to science, for it was science but the absence of prejudice backed by the presence of money?",
  "14260": "Does he think me a ghost?",
  "14261": "Did she know of any place in the neighbourhood where a servant was wanted?",
  "14262": "And very good ones too, I believe, haven't they?",
  "14263": "Passed?",
  "14264": "You surely do not fancy that you can set them free?",
  "14265": "Who can tell it?",
  "14266": "Why will you persist in hopeless obstinacy?",
  "14267": "What did she do at my house?",
  "14268": "And what were the two lines?",
  "14269": "What should we do with this projected surplus?",

  "14273": "What should we have to do?",
  "14274": "Have you no more to add?",
  "14275": "Then have you perceived that you say nothing to the purpose?",
  "14276": "Ye tremble at this word?",
  "14277": "Why has she done nothing to set things right?",
  "14278": "Who informed you this was the master I propose to you?",
  "14279": "Have you mentioned this death in your paper?",
  "14280": "How else could we live did the outer world not furnish our labour and our food?",

  "14510": "Why, you did nothing wrong?",
  "14511": "If you know, why don't you tell?",
  "14512": "Aren't you but fifteen?",
  "14513": "Will you permit me, then, to recall another to you?",
  "14514": "Where is your native isle?",
  "14515": "Why aren't you asleep, sir?",
  "14516": "You will not sell it, will you?",
  "14517": "My dearest girl, what is the matter?",
  "14518": "In what respect?",
  "14519": "Maylie?",
  "14520": "Why were the holy relics, the arms, ammunition, gunpowder, and stores of corn not removed?",
  "14521": "How long has he been away?",
  "14522": "And dogs are deteriorated in the good qualities of dogs, and not of horses?",
  "14523": "How do you know that it was the same fiacre?",
  "14524": "But to whom did you say them?",
  "14525": "But if, now, a disaster were to happen?",
  "14526": "May not the darkness hide it from my face?",
  "14527": "Now, have a turn with me?",
  "14528": "And you do not guess it?",
  "14529": "Why can't I see in the dark?",
  "14530": "Will it never be day?",
  "14531": "O, then, you are in love with him?",
  "14532": "What sort of a face was I to draw?",
  "14533": "Can you believe so?",
  "14534": "Who made this man my master?",
  "14535": "Why should he have pardoned me, then?",
  "14536": "That is so, is it not?",
  "14537": "How has he got rich?",
  "14538": "What more of the man she had told them of before?",
  "14539": "What can all this mean?",
  "14540": "Of what use would it be?",
  "14541": "It's natural and right for 'em to talk different from each other, ain't it?",
  "14542": "Is it not then strange that thy intelligent part only should be disobedient and discontented with its own place?",
  "14543": "Which are the best coasts?",
  "14544": "You wish to join the colony?",
  "14545": "Was it not his betrothal feast?",
  "14546": "Are you not the precious image of each and all of us men in this whaling world?",
  "14547": "It don't take long, does it?",
  "14548": "Will you always stand that way and wait, until it'll becomes morning, noon, and evening?",
  "14549": "Now, you will go, won't you?",
  "14550": "May I ask the reason of your refusal?",
  "14551": "Does he know where I am, aunt?",
  "14552": "Have you anything?",
  "14553": "What liquor?",
  "14554": "Eh, how can I tell?",
  "14555": "What would he think himself?",
  "14556": "Did he understand too well, or did he not understand at all?",
  "14557": "When will you stop such romping ways?",
  "14558": "Who has not?",
  "14559": "Don't you think that any secret course is an unworthy one?",
  "14560": "And what have you been bringing here?",
  "14561": "Are the others clever, sir?",
  "14562": "Why should he run wild upon the moor?",
  "14563": "What they DO doesn't alter the truth of what they say, does it?",
  "14564": "Is it because it is his duty to be grateful?",
  "14565": "Have you put him to any ransom?",
  "14566": "Charlotte?",
  "14567": "What do you make of them?",
  "14568": "Would you be asking me to break my oath?",
  "14569": "Is there nothing I can do?",
  "14570": "Why don't you go home, then, same's me?",
  "14571": "What was this strange house?",
  "14572": "Do you not go with us?",
  "14573": "Think we're as green as to do you in here, and have the police nosing round?",
  "14574": "Taken in by the servant?",
  "14575": "What will become of us?",
  "14576": "D'you understand?",
  "14577": "And these researches?",
  "14578": "Is it some former admirer who wishes to retire?",
  "14579": "And you fancy that the two matters are connected in some way?",
  "14580": "You'll come with me, won't you?",
  "14581": "Your father, or brother, or your betrothed?",
  "14582": "When do you go, sir?",
  "14583": "What if the boy were really not her son, after all?",
  "14584": "Who are you, pray ?",
  "14585": "Well, granting that, what became of him?",
  "14586": "What put that idea in your head?",
  "14587": "Why did you not put your name to the note?",
  "14588": "He has been fairly in?",
  "14589": "Could you get me a part if I paid?",
  "14590": "What is the time now?",
  "14591": "Where do you go?",
  "14592": "Which lady?",
  "14593": "Oh, will you really?",
  "14594": "Who is the gentleman with the telescope?",
  "14595": "Why, indeed?",
  "14596": "That is his meaning then?",
  "14597": "And 'What will you take for the geese?",
  "14598": "Promise not to repeat?",
  "14599": "Are ye tuck sick, or what's come over ye?",
  "14600": "Tell me, why does a steward rob his master?",
  "14601": "Have you no regard for true merit, you malignant fellow?",
  "14602": "And last night he was with us so happy, so cheerful, so affectionate?",
  "14603": "It is not all a question of goods?",
  "14604": "Therefore is my freedom lawful, however proper it may be?",
  "14605": "Were they swept into eternity by a freshet?",
  "14606": "Besides, where was I to find a person to write the words, and one who would give himself the trouble of turning the poetry to my liking?",
  "14607": "Is it in any way different from other schools?",
  "14608": "And what harm if he did talk?",
  "14609": "Us, who have wings and fly?",
  "14610": "A grey mare?",
  "14611": "What effect had this frightful shock produced?",
  "14612": "And he acquiesced?",
  "14613": "So you would advise a knife to his throat?",
  "14614": "How dare you touch that coronet?",
  "14615": "Can't you make it eight?",
  "14616": "What has been decided?",
  "14617": "My dear girl, what have I got to do with her dressing beautifully or looking well?",
  "14618": "Are you speaking seriously, doctor?",
  "14619": "How could that be?",
  "14620": "My companions and myself?",
  "14621": "Do we breakfast or dine?",
  "14622": "Ought any, then, to refuse their aid in doing what good the good of the whole demands?",
  "14623": "Would the stranger one day speak of it?",
  "14624": "What may my father wish to convey?",
  "14625": "At the rate of, sir?",
  "14626": "When did you say he died?",
  "14627": "Well, when is her birthday?",
  "14628": "Is there any political power to authorize such interference?",
  "14629": "Now do you understand?",
  "14630": "And it was she, I presume, who mentioned your name?",
  "14631": "Is that where you live, my little lady?",
  "14632": "Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it?",
  "14633": "Where d' you live, sir?",
  "14634": "Are you come out as against a thief, with swords and staves to take me?",
  "14635": "Do you repent?",
  "14636": "Is the water always turbid?",
  "14637": "Was there nothing to be done?",
  "14638": "Say ye so?",
  "14639": "Well, what is it you really want of me?",
  "14640": "Who shall be the judge of merit?",
  "14641": "How now, nephew?",
  "14642": "Have I forgot my noble birth?",
  "14643": "Well, what shall you do with this money, count?",
  "14644": "Well, what are the names of the patriarchs?",
  "14645": "Have I clearly explained the class which I mean?",
  "14646": "Where can he have been hidden?",
  "14647": "Where did you bring him from?",
  "14648": "How can your lordship imagine that you could ever inconvenience me?",
  "14649": "How did you come here?",
  "14650": "I suppose he never knew me?",
  "14651": "Why did you drive me to such extremities?",
  "14652": "But why should such an idea cross your mind?",
  "14653": "You couldn't take me, could you?",
  "14654": "But how are we to come by the men?",
  "14655": "What can I fear while shielded by protection at once so loving and so powerful?",
  "14656": "When was I in a fearful state?",
  "14657": "Shall I commit adultery?",
  "14658": "What has become of him?",
  "14659": "In that case, monseigneur, do you believe the cardinal will be so kind as to tell me what has become of my wife?",
  "14660": "Can he be sure that the two are necessarily in accord?",
  "14661": "Was there no mention made of me in the letter?",
  "14662": "Are not these beggarly devils sufficiently wretched already?",
  "14663": "Were you ever at sea, before?",
  "14664": "But what did you mean to take?",
  "14665": "Have strangers leave with us to get their wealth?",
  "14666": "If she bleeds to death, is that my fault?",
  "14667": "You are going to leave us after I have become so accustomed to you?",
  "14668": "Can it be done?",
  "14669": "Is she your child?",
  "14670": "What if by endeavouring to place her in the position of a lady, he had falsely so placed her, and robbed her of her legitimate position?",
  "14671": "Am I come to a friend?",
  "14672": "What befals him dead?",
  "14673": "Which way heading?",
  "14674": "Then what shall I gain, pray?",
  "14675": "How do you suppose you can carry on like this?",
  "14676": "Whose service would that be?",
  "14677": "What does all this flight of imagination mean?",
  "14678": "Vansuythen?",
  "14679": "What in the world do you s'pose that is?",
  "14680": "Is our little neighbor worse?",
  "14681": "Where have I been brought to?",
  "14682": "Nor the blue bed?",
  "14683": "My good sir, what is the matter with you, O father?",
  "14684": "How long will it be first?",
  "14685": "Why has she given up sending the children and coming to see us?",
  "14686": "Who is this?",
  "14687": "Is dat you, honey?",
  "14688": "Garth?",
  "14689": "Where do your brothers and sisters live?",
  "14690": "How can I take this stranger into my house?",
  "14691": "Then don't you know how it was?",
  "14692": "Who is it you wish to see?",
  "14693": "Why is it that she speaks to him of about your welfare and your position, as she clearly has done?",
  "14694": "How will that do?",
  "14695": "But why shall I say more?",
  "14696": "I wonder if you will forgive me?",
  "14697": "But with what object?",
  "14698": "Where is the girl?",
  "14699": "You imagined I didn't know you had your watch again?",
  "14700": "And what kind of woman, and of what age is she?",
  "14701": "Prunes?",
  "14702": "How came you to be there?",
  "14703": "And where might it be now?",
  "14704": "Now, how on earth could you know that the stolen silver was at the bottom of that pond?",
  "14705": "There are no villages here?",
  "14706": "What at?",
  "14707": "Something that you would like done, is it not?",
  "14708": "Was that all?",
  "14709": "Will you not let me look at it also?",
  "14710": "And are things in order?",
  "14711": "How about the fireplace?",
  "14712": "Why, what is the matter?",
  "14713": "And what did you say?",
  "14714": "Who is right and who is wrong?",
  "14715": "But if a man had a danger hanging over him, and knew what it was, don't you think he would turn to the police for protection?",
  "14716": "How did it show itself?",
  "14717": "When is this accomplished?",
  "14718": "And have you them yet?",
  "14719": "Did I take this yesterday?",
  "14720": "Will any private training enable him to stand firm against the overwhelming flood of popular opinion?",
  "14721": "Why would ye let such beauty wither?",
  "14722": "What may YOUR game be, ma'am?",
  "14723": "But what does it show?",
  "14724": "Or hear, except with the ear?",
  "14725": "What is the wind?",
  "14726": "It wasn't your fault so why should you mind?",
  "14727": "What must I answer?",
  "14728": "Is there any talk yet of who is to run?",
  "14729": "Must it be so?",
  "14730": "But what can we do?",
  "14731": "Why did you push yourself in there by daylight?",
  "14732": "And does not marriage mean motherhood?",
  "14733": "Don't you belong to the barricade?",
  "14734": "And what do you suppose the master will think when I display it before him?",
  "14735": "Hand over, will you?",
  "14736": "And think there was to you no conscience of the housebreaker, what would you do?",
  "14737": "What is it that you will not do?",
  "14738": "And whither go we, my father?",
  "14739": "What vault?",
  "14740": "By asking advice instead of exerting the judgment?",
  "14741": "Another one, eh?",
  "14742": "Who are they that carry it?",
  "14743": "For what can be the meaning of a truly wise man wanting to fly away and lightly leave a master who is better than himself?",
  "14744": "You think, probably, that I roam around, and get into all sorts of evil?",
  "14745": "Why weren't you at the races yesterday?",
  "14746": "But fly whither?",
  "14747": "May it be that I see you?",
  "14748": "Yes, count, you know what I told you?",
  "14749": "And what kind of a man?",
  "14750": "Have you heard what has happened?",
  "14751": "Does the king exile me?",
  "14752": "And who is that pale young man beside him?",
  "14753": "Yes, isn't it, dear?",
  "14754": "What more need be said?",
  "14755": "Will no danger threaten him?",
  "14756": "How can you reconcile it to your conscience, I wonder, to prejudice my own boy against me, or against anybody who is dear to me?",
  "14757": "Nor of any other such person?",
  "14758": "Will your excellency deign to open it?",
  "14759": "Who amongst us is there that does not recollect similar hours of bitter, bitter childish grief?",
  "14760": "What had he really gained by all this trouble?",
  "14761": "And what was his reply?",
  "14762": "Shall I row you ashore?",
  "14763": "Have I been talking in my sleep?",
  "14764": "Where now?",
  "14765": "The beginning or the end?",
  "14766": "Indeed, where could we stop?",
  "14767": "Wasn't it a lovely place?",
  "14768": "He is dead, is he not?",
  "14769": "The name of my clerk?",
  "14770": "Will you call for the money, or shall I send it?",
  "14771": "But how to get rid of him?",
  "14772": "Who's going?",
  "14773": "How is the queen?",
  "14774": "So you refuse my request?",
  "14775": "You wonder what?",
  "14776": "And who is that other person?",
  "14777": "Rheumatism, sir?",
  "14778": "Am I my brother's keeper?",
  "14779": "What do you mean by early?",
  "14780": "Would they be likely to get rid of seven men out of eight from their own gang and retain only the eighth man?",
  "14781": "You will go to the city and make money, eh?",
  "14782": "Do you think he had planned this robbery, when he went with you to the lodging?",
  "14783": "O, is your bundle ready?",
  "14784": "Real friends?",
  "14785": "Will you never get on to your job?",
  "14786": "And about what?",
  "14787": "You owe her her wages, I suppose?",
  "14788": "Do you know what you have said?",
  "14789": "Balderstone?",
  "14790": "I am having a room got ready for you here, and will you please come round at once on getting this?",
  "14791": "But we owe something in this house?",
  "14792": "And what about afterwards?",
  "14793": "But where will we be tomorrow?",
  "14794": "What advice?",
  "14795": "Who told her?",
  "14796": "Remarkable for what?",
  "14797": "Is it not what happens to every one?",
  "14798": "But how is it she does not think of it herself?",
  "14799": "Who may it be for?",
  "14800": "I say, laddie, you don't object if I sing slightly from time to time during the journey?",
  "14801": "What makes you weep, mama?",
  "14802": "Where is his office?",
  "14803": "What do you mean by that question?",
  "14804": "If this is the great evil of being alone, then what is good and what is evil?",
  "14805": "Have you any arms?",
  "14806": "Are they in possession of our letters?",
  "14807": "Do you observe this gallery, or rather lobby, indeed?",
  "14808": "When will you do that?",
  "14809": "And will not the words and the character of the style depend on the temper of the soul?",
  "14810": "Do you not think that it would be regrettable if we had met in vain?",
  "14811": "Why did she come?",
  "14812": "Is it not safe e'en to encounter him?",
  "14813": "Did any haberdasher ever look so smirking?",
  "14814": "But what degree of intensity will overbalance what period of duration?",
  "14815": "Couldn't we enlarge it, hollow it out, make openings to let in light and air?",
  "14816": "How can I desire children?",
  "14817": "Would I only come and look at the range?",
  "14818": "What is the prisoner's name?",
  "14819": "Well, hasn't it made it exactly what we wanted?",
  "14820": "How can there be any secrecy, when everything is known to all of us?",
  "14821": "You won't carry me off in your bags, will ye, master?",
  "14822": "Where is your master's diocese?",
  "14823": "Why did he so?",
  "14824": "What was it, my own mother?",
  "14825": "But when you held her in your power, why did you not drown her, strangle her, hang her?",
  "14826": "But by whom will Z be paid for the loss caused him by the profit charged by A in the beginning?",
  "14827": "Perhaps, sir, you don't like the ship?",
  "14828": "Do you think I'd let him imagine for a minute that anything he said could influence me in my public duty?",
  "14829": "Is she safe?",
  "14830": "Have I offended you?",
  "14831": "Then you are on guard every day?",
  "14832": "But this castle, then?",
  "14833": "You know him, then?",
  "14834": "What, said he, I wonder, will the good old couple say to it?",
  "14835": "My hand?",
  "14836": "You consider it, then, perfectly unworthy of a woman to love a man who does not adore her?",
  "14837": "Why are you upset?",
  "14838": "Have you anything to ask of me?",
  "14839": "I've accepted your dismissal, and you managed it as cruelly as you could, and I have made you respect my sex, haven't I?",
  "14840": "What must I do?",
  "14841": "You have formed some conclusion?",
  "14842": "Was not the observation of the chief only what might have been expected?",
  "14843": "What right have I to betray the confidence reposed in me, when nothing but a miracle can prevent this sacrifice?",
  "14844": "Can't you be generous and unselfish enough to face whatever trial there may be for you in this bit of a coincidence?",
  "14845": "How did she come there?",
  "14846": "Now, don't you think the lad would be handsomer cropped?",
  "14847": "Who could have told that such a hurricane had been let loose on the surface of that ocean?",
  "14848": "What is the result at present?",
  "14849": "Were you never taught to say your prayers?",
  "14850": "Well, said he, who next?",
  "14851": "Is it suppression?",
  "14852": "Then they will quarrel as those who intend some day to be reconciled?",
  "14853": "Where is the pain?",
  "14854": "Why did you take the axe along?",
  "14855": "How was it done?",
  "14856": "And why are you all alone?",
  "14857": "The scene which followed, who can describe?",
  "14858": "Where would you have been, my dear, if I hadn't meddled with YOU?",
  "14859": "Where does he expect me to get it?",
  "14860": "Did you call, sir?",
  "14861": "Where, then, is your enthusiasm?",
  "14862": "Do you wish it?",
  "14863": "Do you really think so, doctor?",
  "14864": "Oh, is that all?",
  "14865": "Is the point of my mantle in the middle, and have I looped my dress evenly?",
  "14866": "Fifty dollars?",
  "14867": "Why, are you afraid of those fowls?",
  "14868": "What, do you not know your house?",
  "14869": "And on what day did he meet his death?",
  "14870": "What did THEY know about countesses?",
  "14871": "What's that?",
  "14872": "Very well, is she?",
  "14873": "Why does tha' care so much about roses an' such, all of a sudden?",
  "14874": "What will he say when he returns?",
  "14875": "But you changed your mind?",
  "14876": "Could they be assembled in arms, who would dare to assume the office of general?",
  "14877": "Does any one know with whom?",
  "14878": "Now, do you not call that base?",
  "14879": "You think that's a condemnation?",
  "14880": "What have you found?",
  "14881": "And just on this line between the setting and rising sun?",
  "14882": "What was the matter with her, what could be going on, to affect any one like that?",
  "14883": "How had he got there?",
  "14884": "Any fresh face would cause comment?",
  "14885": "Fetch me a cup of coffee, will you?",
  "14886": "What greater gift can man receive than fame, praise and immortality?",
  "14887": "What would he do to her?",
  "14888": "At what time would you like something to eat?",
  "14889": "Where is this man?",
  "14890": "Who would I prefer for mistress of the ceremonies?",
  "14891": "Why did you say that, dear?",
  "14892": "What the hammer?",
  "14893": "Eke at the feast who might her body save?",
  "14894": "Why do you bring them to me?",
  "14895": "You plume yourself on being a wag?",
  "14896": "And how is our dear invalid?",
  "14897": "If you love books, to what place are books so suitable?",
  "14898": "How can this youth ever learn an acquittal from a trial or a legal summons, or persuasive refutation?",
  "14899": "Do you dare to brave me?",
  "14900": "Are you in your senses?",
  "14901": "Is it worth giving them half a hopper full?",
  "14902": "And will you sign the contract?",
  "14903": "What put it into your head?",
  "14904": "Only you?",
  "14905": "Where's my little girl?",
  "14906": "Am I a liar in your eyes?",
  "14907": "Now, why have you kept this lad?",

  "16592": "But under what general concept, in what category of the understanding, is justice placed?",
  "16593": "But how will they draw out the plan of which you are speaking?",
  "16594": "And I was born wi' a caul, and perhaps can be no more ruined than drowned?",
  "16595": "For money?",
  "16596": "But pray tell me what is the meaning of life?",
  "16597": "Is three fifths more than half or less?",

  "16736": "What, exactly, does that mean?",
  "16737": "Is that the real reason of your pious alarms?",
  "16738": "And how long, then, did the madmen reign?",
  "16739": "What sort of place is this?",

  "16747": "Are you crying about father?",
  "16748": "Why did you cry?",
  "16749": "And you would be pleased to have, instead of this terrace of twenty feet, an enclosure of two acres?",
  "16750": "Did they persist in the fatal vice which destroyed them?",
  "16751": "What's the start?",
  "16752": "Besides, what did I ask of you?",
  "16753": "Where is the objection?",
  "16754": "But don't you think it's making rather heavy weather over a trifle?",
  "16755": "Ah, what?",
  "16756": "Why not be friends?",
  "16757": "A decent sort of man, I suppose?",
  "16758": "Hadn't you heard?",
  "16759": "I wonder what it is going to be?",
  "16760": "Is that really so?",

  "16792": "And what's going to happen?",
  "16793": "Why are you weeping then?",
  "16794": "Was either group walled in hopelessly by sheer ignorance?",
  "16795": "Have you ever had any experience?",
  "16796": "Is there anything illogical about the meaning?",
  "16797": "What happens then?",
  "16798": "Were they deceiving him?",
  "16799": "Have you?",
  "16800": "For what are these cries raised?",

  "16808": "What say you, lady?",
  "16809": "You mean to take your horse?",
  "16810": "And a man was with you?",
  "16811": "Can you hold on with one hand long enough to slip the loop of this rope over your shoulders?",
  "16812": "What are you stopping me for?",
  "16813": "Ah, cannot you read between the lines?",
  "16814": "What, therefore, is to be done now?",
  "16815": "How can you do it to me, boys?",
  "16816": "Shall we sling a bowline over the foot?",
  "16817": "Are we not to be friends?",
  "16818": "What would be its fruits?",
  "16819": "What shall you do with this poor fellow?",
  "16820": "Do you, while receiving benefits from me and resting under my shade, dare to describe me as useless, and unprofitable?",
  "16821": "Well, what do you think about it?",
  "16822": "What will become of us?",
  "16823": "What is in their kitchens?",
  "16824": "But for what?",
  "16825": "Driven to do it, were you?",
  "16826": "Are they the work of your hands?",
  "16827": "You are not an enemy of our holy faith?",
  "16828": "Did you get my message?",
  "16829": "But one can draw some hypotheses, I suppose?",
  "16830": "But in public who shall express the unseen adequately?",
  "16831": "Where did you stop?",
  "16832": "Tell me what this wretched war is for?",
  "16833": "Now, where has that nasty little beast gone to?",
  "16834": "Could we put off our wedding till a little later?",
  "16835": "What is that again?",
  "16836": "Is it my father?",
  "16837": "Who and what are they?",
  "16838": "You are not jealous?",
  "16839": "Because you think I must have so little?",

  "16841": "And would you wish to see that poor creature's domestic hearth ruined and broken up?",
  "16842": "Cold?",
  "16843": "What do they want to argue for?",
  "16844": "What did he do to you?",
  "16845": "Who's that which snatched the meat from me?",
  "16846": "Nor anything at all, then, my lady?",

  "16856": "What do you need to cure you of all that?",
  "16857": "Oh, there's more?",
  "16858": "You have, doubtless, already guessed that I was preparing a surprise for you?",

  "16866": "How many of 'em do you intend to save?",
  "16867": "Do you think yourself my master, that you try to keep me under lock and key like this?",
  "16868": "A client, then?",
  "16869": "Well now, don't we do anything for this old country of ours?",
  "16870": "Will you introduce me to her some time, if I call?",
  "16871": "And the dog?",
  "16872": "Did he call out because he landed in the water, do you think?",
  "16873": "What will you give me?",

  "16885": "Your three suits of apparel a year?",
  "16886": "What do you say, why not go after all?",
  "16887": "Unjust, say you, sister?",
  "16888": "And there you are, my partner, eh?",
  "16889": "Is that she, mamma?",
  "16890": "And you, count, have made this match?",
  "16891": "Have you the keys?",
  "16892": "And a hole in the ground means to stop, also, doesn't it?",

  "17709": "Will you march on with him?",
  "17710": "What makes you ask about him?",
  "17711": "You think it's all safe about the copy?",
  "17712": "Was ever such ill luck as mine?",
  "17713": "Would I do for the job?",
  "17714": "Shall the examination proceed?",
  "17715": "But who pulled the strings of that extraordinary puppet?",
  "17716": "Surely what belongs to me belongs no less to you?",
  "17717": "It gives one an awful blank feeling, doesn't it?",
  "17718": "Two of them?",
  "17719": "Bennet?",
  "17720": "Do you think I can be happy in this vulgar silly dress?",
  "17721": "Why do you call me baron?",
  "17722": "Who's afraid to give his name?",
  "17723": "At any rate you can decide whether he who has knowledge will or will not be able to render an account of his knowledge?",
  "17724": "Who was this man who had a bell suspended about him like a ram or an ox?",
  "17725": "You're not afraid?",
  "17726": "Where are you to live?",
  "17727": "What business is it of theirs?",
  "17728": "But what would they say?",
  "17729": "Had he been able to shake hands with his daughter's betrayer?",
  "17730": "Of which everybody is ignorant?",
  "17731": "But is this the only thing which is called odd?",
  "17732": "Where is she, then?",
  "17733": "You are not afraid of what she will say?",
  "17734": "A lady?",
  "17735": "No masque?",
  "17736": "What have we got here?",
  "17737": "Is that quite true?",
  "17738": "No hitch?",
  "17739": "If I do, will I skin through the following one, and so on?",
  "17740": "Is there any sign of the rebel legislature coming together on the understanding of my letter to you?",
  "17741": "What are rats?",
  "17742": "Offensive?",
  "17743": "Is such a thing possible?",
  "17744": "Was it she who gave the alarm?",
  "17745": "To gain the affections of a virtuous man, is affectation necessary?",
  "17746": "Had she recognized him?",
  "17747": "What are you doing there?",
  "17748": "Now, what do you reckon it is?",
  "17749": "Surely the man is a fellow of no particular importance?",
  "17750": "Said I, and where?",
  "17751": "Can such things last?",
  "17752": "On your word?",
  "17753": "If he is not thy brother, who is he, then?",

  "17760": "Must we not look upon you as a confederated body of faithless, treacherous men, whose assurances are fraud, and their language deceit?",
  "17761": "Have you formed any opinion?",
  "17762": "Are you out of your mind?",
  "17763": "Cannot you see that I am in deadly earnest?",
  "17764": "Shall it be with the majority, or the wealthy, with a number of proper persons, or one better than the rest, or with a tyrant?",
  "17765": "What does your mama call you?",
  "17766": "Does it appear otherwise to you?",
  "17767": "Who the deuce have you been with?",
  "17768": "Why, let 'em starve, what's that to me?",
  "17769": "To whom would the thief take it?",
  "17770": "And what do you reckon they said?",
  "17771": "What about the colonies?",
  "17772": "Shall I let the general in?",
  "17773": "Should you not claim to be at least his equal in prowess, and act upon the claim?",
  "17774": "Was it alive?",
  "17775": "And why, sillybillies, do you knock under to one another?",
  "17776": "What poem is it?",
  "17777": "You have got it?",
  "17778": "How can new conditions be found?",
  "17779": "But where, amid all this, is justice?",
  "17780": "Why wouldn't you?",
  "17781": "Do you always look so preternaturally grave?",
  "17782": "Now, I ask you, does it in the least degree resemble that clever and amusing and charming little creature, who has so often deceived us?",
  "17783": "I sagaciously observed, if it didn't signify to him, to whom did it signify?",
  "17784": "In awe of her, child?",
  "17785": "You work, work, and what does it bring you?",
  "17786": "Did you know that there were three other carriages there, in addition to yours?",
  "17787": "You know each other, of course?",
  "17788": "Who told you that I did not make a good use of it?",
  "17789": "Did you ever strike a fish?",
  "17790": "Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to you?",
  "17791": "What speech esteem you most?",
  "17792": "Now, what was servitude?",
  "17793": "Is he right, that man?",
  "17794": "Will you go, then?",
  "17795": "What's the time?",
  "17796": "And why are you here at all?",
  "17797": "In prescribing meats and drinks would he wish to go beyond another physician or beyond the practice of medicine?",
  "17798": "A better shall we have?",
  "17799": "How did you get such small small arms?",
  "17800": "Are we alone?",
  "17801": "Where is your body now?",
  "17802": "Will you allow me to carry the little girl?",
  "17803": "Might I ever have seen one?",
  "17804": "Was it in a dream, or awake, that you saw and heard what struck you then?",
  "17805": "Why not?",
  "17806": "Are there mothers, yes or no, who rock cradles with their foot and who have a lot of little ones around them?",
  "17807": "What are you pushing for?",
  "17808": "Are you there?",
  "17809": "Why did she not rush into his open arms?",
  "17810": "But supposing it was something else?",
  "17811": "Who says so?",
  "17812": "Well, what do you say to this?",
  "17813": "Was it not a comedy, a strange and stupid matter, this repetition, this running around in a fateful circle?",
  "17814": "You will drive, no doubt?",
  "17815": "And does my hair look very bad?",
  "17816": "Whom the people love more and obey better than me?",
  "17817": "What are you looking for?",
  "17818": "Did the despatches by the mail just arrived tend towards peace or misunderstanding?",
  "17819": "Have you received these messages?",
  "17820": "Where shall we go, signior?",
  "17821": "I hope that you are satisfied now?",
  "17822": "What did they do?",
  "17823": "Am I not always good to you, you simpleton?",
  "17824": "What justice lay in putting him to the torture?",
  "17825": "And who shall go before me in the gate?",
  "17826": "What country does he come from?",
  "17827": "Why did the remembrance of that piece of furniture haunt me with such insistence that I retraced my steps?",
  "17828": "A boy phenomenon, perhaps?",
  "17829": "Is it love?",
  "17830": "The raid, you mean?",
  "17831": "Is there anything by which you can trace the marks of freedom, or discover those of wisdom?",
  "17832": "Have you sons in the army?",
  "17833": "Let me share its felicity sometimes, and what do I sacrifice?",
  "17834": "What makes you always put on those old clothes?",
  "17835": "Ask him to show up?",
  "17836": "Now, sir, if a document of this importance were taken at that hour, where can it be now?",
  "17837": "Where have you been all this time?",
  "17838": "Was he afraid of his enemies?",
  "17839": "What do you look at me for?",
  "17840": "Is it really roast beef?",
  "17841": "And will you make the same promise to my love?",
  "17842": "But was not his calm only apparent?",
  "17843": "You are going already?",
  "17844": "Why don't he shut up?",
  "17845": "And how is the expedition to be organized?",
  "17846": "In what way, monseigneur?",
  "17847": "Tell me, what is the matter with you?",
  "17848": "What if there should be any elements of disturbance on which he had not reckoned?",
  "17849": "Is that your name, monsieur?",
  "17850": "Is there any help in the world that I would not give you?",
  "17851": "Why do you take it then?",
  "17852": "Saw it?",
  "17853": "Will he be so very rich?",
  "17854": "Tell me, ye who have studied the human mind, is it not a strange way to fix principles by showing young people that they are seldom stable?",
  "17855": "And do they know it?",
  "17856": "Did he tell you what I paid for it?",
  "17857": "But let whom see?",
  "17858": "Did he take no legal proceedings?",
  "17859": "And when?",
  "17860": "Why don't you let the boy alone?",
  "17861": "Are you engaged at anything in particular?",
  "17862": "What would have been his later steps?",
  "17863": "And his story of waiting day and night for her forgiveness?",
  "17864": "Will we all come together, or come apart?",
  "17865": "Where were their rich apartments, loaded with all that money could provide?",
  "17866": "Then the way of life lies through the factory of death?",
  "17867": "Will you repay me, then, what you borrowed in the argument?",
  "17868": "Was he asked?",
  "17869": "Darbois?",
  "17870": "What's this?",
  "17871": "Peaches?",
  "17872": "Is your curiosity satisfied?",
  "17873": "But what have I done?",
  "17874": "How is it that these should all be changed into a mineral concrete with which we have no acquaintance?",
  "17875": "Or any affinity to virtue in general?",
  "17876": "Ourselves?",
  "17877": "And eight?",
  "17878": "And you must have got on an island, sure?",
  "17879": "What world is this?",
  "17880": "Could I do otherwise?",
  "17881": "Should the prisoners be set at liberty?",
  "17882": "Was it bad?",
  "17883": "Nothing to cut a feeling or sting a passion?",
  "17884": "As far as you could?",
  "17885": "But how are we going to arrange this?",
  "17886": "What was she short of now?",
  "17887": "What is the good of it?",
  "17888": "Does that offend you?",
  "17889": "Seeking what?",
  "17890": "Think I didn't see through your little game?",
  "17891": "Has anything been sent for from a chemist's that I have not examined?",
  "17892": "What is there astonishing in that?",
  "17893": "Is it as bad as that?",
  "17894": "How can a man conceal his character?",
  "17895": "What was movement of inertia, and what its laws?",
  "17896": "And what misfortune could happen to me?",
  "17897": "Done what?",
  "17898": "Are all the devils let loose, then?",
  "17899": "What has being a gentleman ever done for me except make me less able to prey and more easy to be preyed upon?",
  "17900": "Can you ride?",
  "17901": "Surely you have not remarked everything else in her, and only not THIS?",
  "17902": "What then is to be the result?",
  "17903": "You are sure of his feeling for you?",
  "17904": "Are you at home, sir?",
  "17905": "Can't you make some suggestion?",
  "17906": "When he learned this of me, how could I think that he did bear him hate?",
  "17907": "Will you taste, messmate?",
  "17908": "What are laws but expressions of the opinion of some class which has power over the rest of the community?",
  "17909": "You are not going?",
  "17910": "Or is it all only a dream?",
  "17911": "But how is your acquaintance to be long supported, under such extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse?",
  "17912": "How d'you do, friend?",
  "17913": "Why don't you do it then?",
  "17914": "She would tell my father, would she not?",
  "17915": "But say, what hero shall sustain that task?",
  "17916": "Aren't we all flung into the world only to hate each other, and so to torture ourselves and each other?",
  "17917": "Peacock?",
  "17918": "Was all that sound and many noises yours?",
  "17919": "Who are the sinners figuring in his drunken petitions?",
  "17920": "Why don't you go to see them off?",
  "17921": "Isn't it sad?",
  "17922": "Who calls so loud?",
  "17923": "Why don't they cut their own children's ears into points to make them look sharp?",
  "17924": "I can buy pen, ink, and paper?",
  "17925": "Was it too much for you?",
  "17926": "Where could she have learnt this corruption almost incorporeal in the strength of its profanity and dissimulation?",
  "17927": "And what does it all mean?",
  "17928": "What is it for?",
  "17929": "Can not you see to their release?",
  "17930": "How can perfection spring from such materials?",
  "17931": "Where else could I have been?",
  "17932": "And the rich caparison, is that mine, too?",
  "17933": "And are you no longer so?",
  "17934": "What was the issue?",
  "17935": "Shall I see you home?",
  "17936": "Isn't it clever of me to remember that?",
  "17937": "Boofer lady, does 'oo love dadda?",
  "17938": "But how is your fame to be established?",
  "17939": "But what is such a satisfaction in comparison with the happiness of a life?",
  "17940": "Can I tell him I don't love him?",
  "17941": "Of whom and against whom do you demand that security, sir knight?",
  "17942": "Couldn't you give me a few more particulars?",
  "17943": "What on earth induced you to do it?",
  "17944": "Or has it become an indistinct apostolic tradition?",
  "17945": "Do you want to say how much?",
  "17946": "Was this cycle not exhausted and brought to a conclusion for him?",
  "17947": "Think any of the boys 'll run?",
  "17948": "Where do you come from now?",
  "17949": "Can't he spare time to see me?",
  "17950": "Is that an answer for a wife?",
  "17951": "Don't you think you would attract attention?",
  "17952": "And will the love of a lie be any part of a philosopher's nature?",
  "17953": "How did you trace it, then?",
  "17954": "You are mine, my love, aren't you?",
  "17955": "Were you ever painted yet?",
  "17956": "Have you no friends who could assist you?",
  "17957": "And then how would you slip it into my pocket?",
  "17958": "Do you know who this is?",
  "17959": "Do you not remember?",
  "17960": "You know that pair of women's gloves?",
  "17961": "Why did you wish for secrecy?",
  "17962": "Your troubles date from the time of your decision to return?",
  "17963": "Well, what do you think?",
  "17964": "Where was he born?",
  "17965": "What did you say?",
  "17966": "You bring me news, do you say?",
  "17967": "Shall I, in cool blood, set loose upon the earth a daemon whose delight is in death and wretchedness?",
  "17968": "Then what do you call the people with whom they're now having tea?",
  "17969": "And why do we need refreshment, my friends?",
  "17970": "And after all, what do we know of ourselves?",
  "17971": "Was it not probable that these symptoms would increase indefinitely, or at least until terminated by death itself?",
  "17972": "Had he not always been sufficient to himself, and now, at fifty, was it likely that he should trust another?",
  "17973": "Shall I see you again soon?",
  "17974": "Who can draw a strict line of demarcation between mind and body?",
  "17975": "Were there two?",
  "17976": "Are people so unhappy when they love?",
  "17977": "What is your object in speaking to me of this?",
  "17978": "On which side?",
  "17979": "Is he not, comte?",
  "17980": "Feel less thirsty after wetting your throat?",
  "17981": "He is, then, I suppose, the prince's jailer?",
  "17982": "Bends he his steps in our direction, child?",
  "17983": "We should be more cosy, shouldn't we?",
  "17984": "And this is your establishment?",
  "17985": "What are you saying, monsieur?",
  "17986": "Who will make the law?",
  "17987": "Why, are you a doctor, prince, or what?",
  "17988": "Not for long, surely?",
  "17989": "How could she get that?",
  "17990": "Are you acquainted with her?",
  "17991": "Haven't you heard of him?",
  "17992": "Hasn't it kept me and mine for years?",
  "17993": "About what, mama?",
  "17994": "Then what has become of the mummy?",
  "17995": "Mama, how can you sit and hear such statements?",
  "17996": "How can you ask?",
  "17997": "What had she done to excite the malice of an enemy?",
  "17998": "It isn't going to take you out of your way?",
  "17999": "You do not love me, then?",
  "18000": "Where have you come from, my dear count?",
  "18001": "Why are ye sitting here?",
  "18002": "Why then, as I perused them, did the hairs of my head erect themselves on end, and the blood of my body become congealed within my veins?",
  "18003": "And will you not so much honour me and so help me as to read it for me?",
  "18004": "And I shall not see her before you start?",
  "18005": "Or is his gravity only in appearance?",
  "18006": "How can that be done?",
  "18007": "How can we keep company with you?",
  "18008": "Oliver, what's the news?",
  "18009": "Are you?",
  "18010": "If we come soon can you go a piece wid us?",
  "18011": "What rank did he hold on board?",
  "18012": "Do I show it?",
  "18013": "Tilda HAS won something she didn't expect, I think, haven't you, dear?",
  "18014": "What will but felt the fleshly screen?",
  "18015": "If a superior man abandon virtue, how can he fulfil the requirements of that name?",
  "18016": "Hopes hovering in the near future as well as sorrows born of the past?",
  "18017": "Qu'est ce qu'un chancelier?",
  "18018": "You won't speak to me about it, my dear?",
  "18019": "But what ails you, father?",
  "18020": "Where are you going, wife?",
  "18021": "On business?",
  "18022": "Do you smell this little marsh?",
  "18023": "And reasoning is peculiarly his instrument?",
  "18024": "How the devil is one to get the intention of the soul except by painting exactly what one sees?",
  "18025": "None of my knaves there?",
  "18026": "Have you been waiting long?",
  "18027": "It's true they are innocent, isn't it?",
  "18028": "Or evil expectations?",
  "18029": "By the way, papa, where do you make the explosives?",
  "18030": "But who is this that breaks upon me?",
  "18031": "Why do you shout so?",
  "18032": "What must I promise?",
  "18033": "And you have accepted him?",
  "18034": "And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?",
  "18035": "Do you mean the bo'sun?",
  "18036": "To its address, my lord?",
  "18037": "What made you think it was she?",
  "18038": "What shall I say, madam?",
  "18039": "I believe I've only had the honour of seeing you once myself?",
  "18040": "I told him, and he was attentive until I had finished, and then burst out laughing again, and asked me if I was sore afterwards?",
  "18041": "Has the proud young lady gone?",
  "18042": "And did you also discover a bitter taste?",
  "18043": "You don't believe in having any standard of behaviour at all, do you?",
  "18044": "Should he find that place in this city if he could get there?",
  "18045": "Must I give up my place to your eminence, or shall I continue?",
  "18046": "Shall I be fatal to your happiness?",
  "18047": "Then why not come to it?",
  "18048": "Who in the dance so fleet?",
  "18049": "What are you reading now?",
  "18050": "You saw the captain?",
  "18051": "What say you to that?",
  "18052": "If the question is put, why do men desire to deposit their life outside their bodies?",
  "18053": "Well, but shall we not meet again?",
  "18054": "When you said that, did you mean that it seemed to you to be louder than the second one?",
  "18055": "We are almost drowned here amongst these lettuce, shall we speak?",
  "18056": "But it is long ago?",
  "18057": "How can I explain that infatuation?",
  "18058": "Well, what did he say about me?",
  "18059": "If it is my name I must have it, mustn't I?",
  "18060": "Are they boys?",
  "18061": "Do you affirm that?",
  "18062": "And who is to pursue him?",
  "18063": "Are you really sad?",
  "18064": "And where are your sisters?",
  "18065": "Well, what have you got to say to me?",
  "18066": "Has there been any inconsistency on his side to create alarm?",
  "18067": "Didn't the people laugh?",
  "18068": "How does it differ from soul?",
  "18069": "And what effect did this discourse produce?",
  "18070": "Rather a good marriage this, I believe?",
  "18071": "Which way is not despair?",
  "18072": "And what brings you up here under somebody else's name?",
  "18073": "May it not be that the utopists find it easier to expatiate upon these grand words than to seriously study social manifestations?",
  "18074": "Are you looking for anything?",
  "18075": "Did she perform any ceremony befitting it, or what did she do?",
  "18076": "Let me see, what harvest shall we have?",
  "18077": "To us forever are the gates of heaven shut, for who shall open them to us again?",
  "18078": "And now what is to be done?",
  "18079": "You say that she must have come back this way?",
  "18080": "There, NOW do you understand?",
  "18081": "What is the matter with you, you fool?",
  "18082": "Could he trust himself to come down to breakfast a free man in the morning?",
  "18083": "Could she make that sacrifice?",
  "18084": "Now, what in the world ailed the creature?",
  "18085": "Will they never bring that emetic?",
  "18086": "What have we to do?",
  "18087": "He did not marry this accomplished young lady?",
  "18088": "Who says man and wife are bad company?",
  "18089": "Who is to dance?",
  "18090": "That's all you know of him?",
  "18091": "But what business had rushes there, or I among them?",
  "18092": "If they don't stop, why should I?",
  "18093": "Why shouldn't they put 'em up and sell 'em by auction to men who are in need of such articles?",
  "18094": "And in what part of it?",
  "18095": "What have you been doing since I last saw you?",
  "18096": "Did she suffer from heart complaint?",
  "18097": "Could you come?",
  "18098": "Don't that seem strange?",

  "20904": "Will you answer me, sir?",
  "20905": "Are there no boys at the farm?",
  "20906": "And pray what do you call such an action?",
  "20907": "No money?",
  "20908": "What do I know about it?",
  "20909": "Am I not right?",
  "20910": "Why should he hold his tongue?",
  "20911": "If you did not feel that it was wrong, why did you join in providing that men should be hung for it?",
  "20912": "Your father walks rather too quick for you, don't he, my man?",
  "20913": "Are not your name, your social position, and your merit sufficient?",
  "20914": "Why are you so unhappy, mother?",
  "20915": "And did you give me tobacco yesterday?",
  "20916": "For the last time, I ask you, will you reply to my questions?",
  "20917": "Who is this?",
  "20918": "Whence I came?",
  "20919": "Suppose he did all this, what then?",
  "20920": "How is it with you?",
  "20921": "Who is that girl?",
  "20922": "What can she have said?",
  "20923": "Must I see my poor chile' go after all my hope to save her?",
  "20924": "Someone else?",
  "20925": "That conveys nothing to you?",
  "20926": "And how was he to meet her again on this very day?",
  "20927": "Who the devil prevents you?",
  "20928": "Then why will you not be my wife?",
  "20929": "In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?",
  "20930": "But who else COULD it be, my very dear prince?",
  "20931": "Do you think it would be unfriendly of me if I said I was busy?",
  "20932": "How old is she?",
  "20933": "WILL you shake hands?",
  "20934": "Can't they do anything to help me?",
  "20935": "Did you ever hear of a dog running up a curtain?",
  "20936": "What is all my world after?",
  "20937": "And suppose he should say all he knows?",
  "20938": "Whether they are going to convict, or whatever it is, that dreadful soldier?",
  "20939": "Do you see this diamond?",
  "20940": "Why did he not go?",
  "20941": "Who was this man who held in his finger these curiously variegated links of an unknown chain?",
  "20942": "How much may not a few months do?",
  "20943": "What would this chamber of justice do?",
  "20944": "Well, yes, you are right, I am a fool, why not simply remain here?",
  "20945": "Are you going to shoot me?",
  "20946": "Oh, do you know that it is cruel never to name the name of the loved one?",
  "20947": "Couldn't one do anything for her?",
  "20948": "Is he quiet?",
  "20949": "A girl, is it?",
  "20950": "Shall a curiosity, which seems to lead nowhere, be satisfied?",
  "20951": "Was there no injustice in this?",
  "20952": "A dead dog, or rabbits, or what?",
  "20953": "Have you plotted to drown me?",
  "20954": "Oh, where was he?",
  "20955": "If I might make a suggestion, sir?",
  "20956": "What decision?",
  "20957": "Have you a mind to go ashore there?",
  "20958": "From number sixty?",
  "20959": "Or was the projectile nothing now but a metal coffin, bearing three corpses into space?",
  "20960": "What is the difficulty?",
  "20961": "How could you shut me out, bear it all alone?",
  "20962": "Would it be an indiscretion to ask to see those precious pills?",
  "20963": "And who is the cause of all this annoyance?",
  "20964": "After this, what more can be wanted?",
  "20965": "Tame?",
  "20966": "Will you take these mementos to him?",
  "20967": "And WHERE has he gone?",
  "20968": "But what is the point of it?",
  "20969": "And what good is it to the bubble while it holds together, or what harm when it is burst?",
  "20970": "What are you going to do with yourselves after you get settled?",
  "20971": "Is that it, my dear?",
  "20972": "If one is not to get into a rage sometimes, what is the good of being friends?",
  "20973": "Where shall I put all this treasure, and which way shall I go?",
  "20974": "Aren't you afraid to be wicked?",
  "20975": "Why not mention these almost divinely childish sayings of kindness?",
  "20976": "Awake?",
  "20977": "Bucket?",
  "20978": "WHICH one is the poet?",
  "20979": "What if her nerve had given way under the strain?",
  "20980": "That's about what YOU are, you know, ain't you?",
  "20981": "What are you up to, little man?",
  "20982": "Don't you see the rain is coming on?",
  "20983": "More powerful than my mother, then?",
  "20984": "Do you know, all through dinner I had a kind of rummy idea that there was something I'd forgotten, but I couldn't think what?",
  "20985": "You are convinced?",
  "20986": "Yes, why?",
  "20987": "Where did she live?",
  "20988": "Good?",
  "20989": "You love me?",
  "20990": "Why are you so impatient?",
  "20991": "Well, what if it is?",
  "20992": "Shall I ever forget the triple horror of that spectacle?",
  "20993": "Do you deny that?",
  "20994": "Will you turn the hay over to us, the hay in the old stack?",
  "20995": "But aren't there people who cannot pass examinations?",
  "20996": "But that way of arguing by imaginary instances is not supposed to be genuine, is it?",
  "20997": "Or am I going mad?",
  "20998": "What is the price?",
  "20999": "On what shall I reflect?",
  "21000": "So near, are we?",
  "21001": "Didn't a stranger arrive here last night?",
  "21002": "And will it cost much?",
  "21003": "We are not wrong therefore in calling them necessary?",
  "21004": "Gentlemen, did you ever see a scorpion pinned to a wall?",
  "21005": "But what about the lamps?",
  "21006": "But then?",
  "21007": "Isn't it right?",
  "21008": "And me, too?",
  "21009": "I suppose you gave a goodish figure for him?",
  "21010": "A surprise?",
  "21011": "Why cannot we launch into space through the scuttle?",
  "21012": "Is that what you wish for?",
  "21013": "Die for it?",
  "21014": "They must have been mistaken, surely?",
  "21015": "Absolutely?",
  "21016": "Is this the recompense you had in store for me?",
  "21017": "Shall I go and see if I can find them?",
  "21018": "Will you let me try to mend it for you?",
  "21019": "And for ever?",
  "21020": "You whom I regard as the last word, the last charming and delightful word, in modern womanhood?",
  "21021": "To avoid this dilemma what is proposed?",
  "21022": "Well, have there been reviews of your book?",
  "21023": "Kiss any of them?",
  "21024": "Would he really be permitted to lean on his father's broad breast once more?",
  "21025": "Have you had board and lodging too?",
  "21026": "Frequently?",
  "21027": "Hasn't ye 'eard that devil's spawn of a capting an' is mates knockin' the bloomin' lights outen 'arf the crew?",
  "21028": "What might the staying of my blood portend?",
  "21029": "Mother, do you see this?",
  "21030": "Have you so soon forgotten from whom you received the foolish instrument you hold in your hand?",
  "21031": "And don't go to any meeting yourself, do you hear?",
  "21032": "Are periodical visits made to the grave?",
  "21033": "Well, now then, the count?",
  "21034": "Whether he had any accomplices, or whatever the thing is called in the law?",
  "21035": "You think it will come to that?",
  "21036": "Cut a man?",
  "21037": "But is there no mitigating circumstance?",
  "21038": "Who are these gentlemen whom you have brought with you?",
  "21039": "Anything down there about your souls?",
  "21040": "What can she do?",
  "21041": "Is there no remedy for this?",
  "21042": "Is this small saving or frugality?",
  "21043": "In danger from you?",
  "21044": "Was the veil about to be rent?",
  "21045": "What were you saying to this youngster?",
  "21046": "Where have you been hiding yourself, you naughty boy?",
  "21047": "How dare you call me flimsy?",
  "21048": "For if the living spring from any other things, and they too die, must not all things at last be swallowed up in death?",
  "21049": "Had she betrayed him?",
  "21050": "Heart, what will you say if this be the appendix or label to both you indentures?",
  "21051": "Ain't you afraid you'll hurt yourself?",
  "21052": "Witty?",
  "21053": "Did I tell you to come around to day?",
  "21054": "You remember that fellow who came upon the evening before you left us?",
  "21055": "And you did not believe him when he said that?",
  "21056": "How can they?",
  "21057": "And always with the same lady?",
  "21058": "Have you read his article?",
  "21059": "So, then, they drew up the indictments before the king was taken?",
  "21060": "But eternal justice?",
  "21061": "Can you wonder I'm lonesome?",
  "21062": "Is it us?",
  "21063": "Then what do you hope for?",
  "21064": "Is it sweetening yet?",
  "21065": "Should he give to his cowardice the pretext of patriotism?",
  "21066": "What did you let her bring you for?",

  "21068": "At what solution should he arrive?",
  "21069": "Shall I call up our men from beyond the hill?",
  "21070": "My marriage?",
  "21071": "Hadn't they said all along that all that was needed was a little faith and effort?",
  "21072": "When did such a massacre occur?",
  "21073": "Do you know the town at all?",
  "21074": "Hadn't she wanted to give him the money, and said how very sorry she was?",
  "21075": "Is it because you love her so passionately?",
  "21076": "What is he after?",
  "21077": "Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison?",
  "21078": "Does this oath satisfy you?",

  "21100": "Will you let me have another cup?",
  "21101": "Is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think?",
  "21102": "What are you up to, now?",
  "21103": "Shall I have my son a stager now?",
  "21104": "Whither did he go?",
  "21105": "Pratt?",
  "21106": "Would she?",
  "21107": "But I say, you know, she can't be as young as she was once, eh?",

  "21121": "Was my uncle beside himself?",
  "21122": "Couldn't you stop on for just this year?",
  "21123": "Do you find, sir, said I, that I encouraged his proposal, or do you not?",
  "21124": "Now, governor, the sum?",
  "21125": "But do you know who rescued her?",
  "21126": "Finally, what still remained to be sacrificed?",
  "21127": "Where are you from?",
  "21128": "I wonder who it can be?",
  "21129": "His duty?",
  "21130": "Change the sir to one less poignant?",
  "21131": "What's the use of writing at all if nobody can understand it?",
  "21132": "Another enemy to harass me in my misery?",
  "21133": "Do none suggest themselves?",
  "21134": "And where does one take the air in this island?",

  "21141": "General, why have we not had any ices?",
  "21142": "But what have I done?",
  "21143": "Shall we go there?",
  "21144": "Mirabell, did you take exceptions last night?",
  "21145": "What did he think?",
  "21146": "Whom do they hate most?",
  "21147": "Come, now, what are your conditions?",
  "21148": "Was any other bicycle missing?",
  "21149": "What's the good of denying it, my dear?",
  "21150": "Do you think, then, monsieur, that we shall travel faster with two horses apiece?",
  "21151": "A nonentity, sir?",
  "21152": "Did they lose their provisions and starve in the desert?",
  "21153": "But how could she reach it?",
  "21154": "Those who recommend a contempt of mankind, and those who inculcate a reverence for humanity?",
  "21155": "How slowly do the houres theyr numbers spend?",
  "21156": "Do I understand that you will take her with you?",
  "21157": "Great statesmen err, and why not small medical men?",
  "21158": "And none of your people had by chance been to see you?",
  "21159": "Do you not perceive that it would be an agent of safety instead of destruction?",
  "21160": "What's th' good fightin' 'mong ourselves?",
  "21161": "You see no difficulty, heh?",
  "21162": "Will that do?",
  "21163": "For what sin, or for what crime?",
  "21164": "Like any warm water?",
  "21165": "To reflect?",
  "21166": "How does this bear on the case?",
  "21167": "Well, supposing I and the others refused to serve, as you are doing?",
  "21168": "We?",
  "21169": "Can't you hear?",
  "21170": "Which is worse?",
  "21171": "Well, then, what are they FOR?",

  "21173": "You've just come?",
  "21174": "She has a pretty face, has she not?",
  "21175": "But would it make his life harder if we were to see each other sometimes?",
  "21176": "You wished to see me, your lordship?",
  "21177": "By the way, DID he beat you?",
  "21178": "How did the man give it you?",
  "21179": "Who lost it?",
  "21180": "Nothing of what?",
  "21181": "And what did these two sovereigns give you in exchange for these magnificent presents?",
  "21182": "If there be no unchanging mirror, bright and clean, bow can there be the various images, unreal and temporary, reflected in it?",
  "21183": "Who are all these people?",
  "21184": "What is it, sir?",
  "21185": "But has she told you nothing?",
  "21186": "Have you no wish in reference to your case?",
  "21187": "Isn't this a prosperous nation?",
  "21188": "Don't know?",
  "21189": "That was the way, was it?",
  "21190": "Pull, can't ye?",
  "21191": "Does she refuse me?",
  "21192": "And now tell me, father, while we are still in friendly country, if you know of any resources that I could make my own?",
  "21193": "What's the matter, are you asleep?",
  "21194": "Was my maternal parent aware, in a word, of my absence from the domiciliary residence?",
  "21195": "As we are imagining what is impossible and absurd, suppose we change the subject?",
  "21196": "Is that what he rang for?",
  "21197": "Where will she go?",
  "21198": "Charley does?",
  "21199": "Do you think they have recognized us?",
  "21200": "Do you release her from her promise?",
  "21201": "Why a battle, in the first place?",
  "21202": "When will you go?",
  "21203": "They have in view practice only, and are always speaking?",
  "21204": "She has told you?",
  "21205": "What then is become of that friendship and confidence, and by what means have I lost them?",
  "21206": "Are you sure he hasn't cheated you?",
  "21207": "Is it a bargain, or is it not?",
  "21208": "Heldar?",
  "21209": "Never even hinted, for instance, that your patron might have views as to your marriage ultimately?",
  "21210": "Do you know of whom I mean to speak?",
  "21211": "So much the worse, is it?",
  "21212": "Don't you know me?",
  "21213": "You would accept?",
  "21214": "They do very well here?",
  "21215": "What was the reason?",
  "21216": "How many have you?",
  "21217": "Shall it be brandy and water?",
  "21218": "How was it, when I saw the personal, the selfish point of view of the voice, that I did not suspect some impostor?",
  "21219": "What should I stay for?",
  "21220": "Do you see this russet?",
  "21221": "What aim, what purpose, what ambition in life have you now?",
  "21222": "How are we to distinguish those that are always valid from others?",
  "21223": "What would that other channel probably be?",
  "21224": "Have you not retained an hotel?",
  "21225": "Was it not very extraordinary that you should do this on the very day when there were these papers inside?",
  "21226": "But would you have any objections to my laying down before the fire?",
  "21227": "How many are of your party?",
  "21228": "Ow d'you know there's going to be a next time?",
  "21229": "Percerin?",
  "21230": "Are you in fear of me still?",
  "21231": "Do I know her?",
  "21232": "Did you know?",
  "21233": "Tell me, are you this young fellow's father?",
  "21234": "Does it?",
  "21235": "Is that far?",
  "21236": "Do you suppose, for a moment, he will not recognise that?",
  "21237": "Have you indeed?",
  "21238": "And his address?",
  "21239": "And yet, what could have happened?",
  "21240": "Will it not, sir?",
  "21241": "Now, why need you do it?",
  "21242": "You have got out insurances on our lives and want to give way with their oars, and pocket the proceeds, do ye?",
  "21243": "If these be the effects of friendship, what are those of enmity?",

  "21246": "The name of this creek, my friends?",
  "21247": "About those three or four gentlemen whom you wish to invite here?",
  "21248": "Why do you want the rest?",
  "21249": "Do your people talk about that too?",
  "21250": "Why can't we always fish from the boat instead of from the dories?",
  "21251": "I suppose you've quite got over it now, haven't you?",
  "21252": "Tulliver?",
  "21253": "What do you do instead?",
  "21254": "Why does your ladyship ask?",
  "21255": "Would they be naughty then?",
  "21256": "Was it a bet?",
  "21257": "How dare you come in so?",
  "21258": "But who was to lead the men?",
  "21259": "Won't you be mine from now on?",
  "21260": "Or a sausage or something?",
  "21261": "Why don't you say something?",
  "21262": "Or was it some one who was with the thief who did it in order to prevent the crime?",

  "21282": "And now?",
  "21283": "Here?",
  "21284": "What have you done, then?",
  "21285": "And how do you think I can ride when I haven't got a habit?",

  "21287": "When will this organ of popular interests and the electoral reform cease to hire sceptics and spread doubt?",
  "21288": "Not for money?",
  "21289": "And how would you set about it?",
  "21290": "How, then, may you accomplish the impossible?",
  "21291": "And then, sir, do you wish me to speak freely to you?",
  "21292": "Really, have you had a vision of the seven fat kine and the seven lean kine?",
  "21293": "What light then does our new material throw upon traditional origins of civilization?",

  "21295": "Why not call it then frankly his complete success?",
  "21296": "In my house?",
  "21297": "Then where will you be?",
  "21298": "But how in the world can it be done?",
  "21299": "And what shall I do now?",

  "24104": "Can you not trust me as a physician when I tell you so?",
  "24105": "Then what, exactly, is your plan for us?",
  "24106": "How did you do that?",
  "24107": "If so, what news?",
  "24108": "Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as his father did before him?",
  "24109": "Why don't you do something useful?",
  "24110": "But when and where had I seen them?",
  "24111": "Did any see it after?",
  "24112": "Lithia?",
  "24113": "Why should not the same sort of thing happen to me?",
  "24114": "Do you think so, really?",
  "24115": "And you would say the same sort of thing of the physician?",
  "24116": "But was it cast after all?",
  "24117": "Both lost?",
  "24118": "Is he so haughty?",
  "24119": "How then can I know, my dear?",
  "24120": "Will not?",
  "24121": "Will it not slap and pinch the envious dowager, that dares to reflect upon its own delicious?",
  "24122": "Can you still lie?",
  "24123": "You wished me to know the reasons?",
  "24124": "Or else, why did she not go out of the neighborhood, and get a situation where she was not known?",
  "24125": "Do you know that he holds terrestrial beings under his control?",
  "24126": "Has she been with you long?",
  "24127": "Or shall we say that they are in harmony with the apparent social will only, and really stand condemned?",
  "24128": "An explanation?",
  "24129": "What shall I be next?",
  "24130": "Where's the larder?",
  "24131": "Suppose a boy sauced you back when you told him to do something?",
  "24132": "Putting ourselves out of the question, what would you think of a girl who could engage herself to any man under such circumstances?",
  "24133": "As at present?",
  "24134": "What is your name?",
  "24135": "Whom have I hurt?",
  "24136": "Do you mean if you give in?",
  "24137": "Or have tasted the bag of the bee?",
  "24138": "For rich caparisons or trapping gay?",
  "24139": "Would you have it?",
  "24140": "What hotel did you manage?",
  "24141": "Where falls the balance of freedoms here?",
  "24142": "What sauce are they most dainty for?",
  "24143": "What will have gained by telling me all this?",
  "24144": "Is there not love in my heart, and constancy in my resolves?",
  "24145": "Is this aught like to thy friend?",
  "24146": "Were not the odds the other way?",
  "24147": "Did he keep any record of his cases?",
  "24148": "How often have I asked you not to take my things?",
  "24149": "How can one wrong creatures that don't exist?",
  "24150": "Rank?",
  "24151": "Well, then, how's he going to take the sea baths if it ain't on the sea?",
  "24152": "How did it begin, when did it all come about?",
  "24153": "Where do you go?",
  "24154": "Well, what is to be done?",
  "24155": "Can you hear a mewing cat?",
  "24156": "Well, isn't it all for her good?",
  "24157": "Have you any opinion to offer, count?",
  "24158": "How long must we stay, do you think?",
  "24159": "What, gossip?",
  "24160": "What is the matter with it?",
  "24161": "But may I be allowed to place the mark for the second shooting?",
  "24162": "Have you ever noticed that all little children are blond?",
  "24163": "And that cavalier, that guest, that nobleman who arrived before she came?",
  "24164": "When am I to wear it?",
  "24165": "What made you go blind that sudden?",
  "24166": "How do you communicate?",
  "24167": "Have you enemies, then?",
  "24168": "Which of them will you test?",
  "24169": "Would you really do that?",
  "24170": "How is your old fellow?",
  "24171": "What bottles?",
  "24172": "Could we not keep it as a secret?",
  "24173": "But proportional to what?",
  "24174": "How did you come here?",
  "24175": "What would these insects eat, if we did not pass this way?",
  "24176": "Your advice, then?",
  "24177": "From the monastery?",
  "24178": "Are you not meditating?",
  "24179": "Why otherwise, with such an opportunity, hadn't he demanded it?",
  "24180": "Would you compel such a state of affairs?",
  "24181": "Then how do you know?",
  "24182": "Where must I sleep, then?",
  "24183": "Supposing nobody should ever fetch me, how long would they consent to keep me there?",
  "24184": "You will marry me, won't you?",
  "24185": "And I?",
  "24186": "Are you alone, madam?",
  "24187": "Vulgar?",
  "24188": "Is not this change wrought in your minds a very important change?",
  "24189": "True?",
  "24190": "Shall I run on and stop them?",
  "24191": "What sort of road would that be?",
  "24192": "Is it your intention to go to an hotel, sir?",
  "24193": "Agree with what?",
  "24194": "Shall we go this high very long?",
  "24195": "Up?",
  "24196": "Was it this room?",
  "24197": "How then was thy tail created?",
  "24198": "Anyone shot a fox?",
  "24199": "Then what business is it of yours?",
  "24200": "Dishonorable?",
  "24201": "What is the steamer's name?",
  "24202": "Do you often go to see it?",
  "24203": "Damn me, won't you dance?",
  "24204": "How is it that the convicts are lying yonder dead, in the middle of the enclosure?",
  "24205": "But where should she go?",
  "24206": "You would be afraid to draw such an inference, would you not?",
  "24207": "Why, instead of a revolution, did they not content themselves with a reform?",
  "24208": "Why should you say that?",
  "24209": "And had it ready a nice little pinch of salt to put upon his tail?",
  "24210": "In what direction?",
  "24211": "And why was this?",
  "24212": "Now, did it strike your ladyship that she was like anybody?",
  "24213": "An' s'posin' he does?",
  "24214": "What do you mean to do with him?",
  "24215": "Not caring for their lives, is it?",
  "24216": "Will you promise to sit up with me to bear me company?",
  "24217": "What are you waiting for?",
  "24218": "What bell was that?",
  "24219": "And with you, governor?",
  "24220": "Perhaps you don't know it?",
  "24221": "How came the words forth from her?",
  "24222": "Have I not always fought for your glory and interests?",
  "24223": "What, after all, was this blood of which she had taught herself to think so much?",
  "24224": "How do you do?",
  "24225": "But could it be otherwise?",
  "24226": "Must I compel men to render her fitting honor?",
  "24227": "For who gets wealth, that puts not from the shore?",
  "24228": "You feel, in other words, that she lies to you?",
  "24229": "Who has?",
  "24230": "And what crime has he committed?",
  "24231": "And whom are you waiting for?",
  "24232": "Why not say so?",
  "24233": "Nine, ten, eleven?",
  "24234": "And it was a fierce one?",
  "24235": "Why couldn't he go to his own home?",
  "24236": "What is it they 'ad of you, sir?",
  "24237": "What have you been doing all this time, eh?",
  "24238": "Well, what does that lead up to?",
  "24239": "To whom did he call?",
  "24240": "And what are you?",
  "24241": "Could he be dead?",
  "24242": "Will you be willing to leave your present situation and try?",
  "24243": "What else can we do?",
  "24244": "Had he fallen during the attack on his rider, or was he straying in the bush, or had the convicts carried him off?",
  "24245": "How can he tell?",
  "24246": "Is it with me or for me that you are angry?",
  "24247": "Then how is it that I seem to understand them myself?",
  "24248": "What am I to DO with this?",
  "24249": "Where dwell we now?",
  "24250": "Why are they always anxious?",
  "24251": "What man has authority over himself?",
  "24252": "Who attends to them?",
  "24253": "And now, monseigneur, your answer to this proposition?",
  "24254": "And that caused his sister to refuse my brother?",
  "24255": "Didn't your grandmother ever write you?",
  "24256": "And you think she would be angry?",
  "24257": "What news have you?",
  "24258": "And have you not seen any of our other friends?",
  "24259": "All I'd done?",
  "24260": "If there are other causes of poverty than competition, does that prevent it from contributing its share?",
  "24261": "Why should I deceive you?",
  "24262": "What is it you fear?",
  "24263": "Faithful to whom?",
  "24264": "Ah, but if you got nothing to eat for ever so long?",
  "24265": "A horror?",
  "24266": "Do you think I was sorry?",
  "24267": "What's the matter?",
  "24268": "What about the chair?",
  "24269": "I suppose you will live with her now?",
  "24270": "Of what consequence is it to me, then, whether he be grateful or not?",
  "24271": "And why should the goblins mind you, pray?",
  "24272": "What villainy is this?",
  "24273": "Blewett?",
  "24274": "At home?",
  "24275": "Why, instead of transports that should have intoxicated me with their deliciousness, did I experience only fears and repugnance?",
  "24276": "Whats he?",
  "24277": "Well, he took that icon home with him for a few days and what did he do?",
  "24278": "Why, we must ask, do you trouble yourself so much about death?",
  "24279": "How does your lady, and how thrives your love?",
  "24280": "The greatest affection of which he is capable?",
  "24281": "Wife?",
  "24282": "A pox, is this your inns o' court breeding, not to know your friends and your relations, your elders, and your betters?",
  "24283": "For whence should it be derived?",
  "24284": "Why don't you speak to her?",
  "24285": "And what's her name?",
  "24286": "What are those we know?",
  "24287": "Now do you want me to tell you who you are?",
  "24288": "Are you dissatisfied with my service, say?",
  "24289": "What is the object of slaying the spirit of vegetation at any time and above all in spring, when his services are most wanted?",
  "24290": "What is there in your son's face?",
  "24291": "Gone where?",
  "24292": "What length of course do you propose, dear heart?",
  "24293": "Isn't the house shut up, too?",
  "24294": "Isn't she here?",
  "24295": "In what manner was I protected by him?",
  "24296": "What do you like best?",
  "24297": "Harder on the back, this, than frum the dory, ain't it?",
  "24298": "Is it customary, I ask you, to help to tenderloin with one's fingers?",
  "24299": "Do you imagine that a person can die like this?",
  "24300": "Have you received the orders, and will you act upon them?",
  "24301": "How are they called who follow others in spite of them?",
  "24302": "Do you mean that you saw the murder?",
  "24303": "So I ask you if ye were her friends?",
  "24304": "Was it not then a man like you and me, who first proposed this law, and by speaking persuaded the ancients?",
  "24305": "A political one, I suppose?",
  "24306": "But is there anything impossible for my d'Artagnan, the noble and loyal gentleman?",
  "24307": "What, I ask, in that case, would have been your conduct towards her?",
  "24308": "Do I turn to the right, or to the left hand?",
  "24309": "And suppose he falls?",
  "24310": "An expedition, sir?",
  "24311": "Is it not enough to set him thinking about it?",
  "24312": "What am I?",
  "24313": "An' did ye not marry a nagur?",
  "24314": "Do you believe they're his own?",
  "24315": "But you're not making a mistake?",
  "24316": "Was you a party in anything, ma'am?",
  "24317": "The knight they went to?",
  "24318": "Ask him what?",
  "24319": "Won't that make it all right?",
  "24320": "Have I done something for the general interest?",
  "24321": "Have they legs and chops?",
  "24322": "What do you mean by this conduct?",
  "24323": "You're not a skater, I suppose?",
  "24324": "With him, aunt?",
  "24325": "Why does he not come to me?",
  "24326": "Among all the unfathomable precipices which surrounded him, which was his choice?",
  "24327": "Isn't it an extraordinary thing?",
  "24328": "Mais, monsieur, is it not time to begin to take more counsel of humanity, and less of your courage?",
  "24329": "Don't you see that flock of big birds making for us?",
  "24330": "How shall I requite you?",
  "24331": "Or when he chew'd it?",
  "24332": "How do I know, my dear, what young men do?",
  "24333": "How can I regret when what I did was inevitable?",
  "24334": "And, after all, why shouldn't we believe that?",
  "24335": "Can you have the heart to do it?",
  "24336": "Was not death infinitely more lovely and noble than such a life?",
  "24337": "When shall I set out?",
  "24338": "But what is this on the chest?",
  "24339": "Where's mother?",
  "24340": "Shall we turn?",
  "24341": "And now, do you wish to attend to your letters?",
  "24342": "May it be that, in some fashion or other, you want me?",
  "24343": "Do you know that the least garrison is of twenty companies of infantry?",
  "24344": "Have these confessed?",
  "24345": "Do you suppose I've asked him for an assurance?",
  "24346": "Are you sure it was my house she was coming to?",
  "24347": "And what are those hatfuls of pence and halfpence?",
  "24348": "What does the change mean?",
  "24349": "Monsieur le comte had an enemy there, then?",
  "24350": "Didn't I explain to you?",
  "24351": "Oh, can't you understand?",
  "24352": "Where are you off to?",
  "24353": "Why should this be so?",
  "24354": "His son?",
  "24355": "Well, and what next?",
  "24356": "What, you're on his track?",
  "24357": "Do you expect them today?",
  "24358": "A parson?",
  "24359": "Now, in what sign will the sun then be?",
  "24360": "Is that the way you love your neighbor as yourself?",
  "24361": "If they hear of this, will they let it pass?",
  "24362": "But where are you going,' that you talk about bidding goodbye?",
  "24363": "So you hate each other?",
  "24364": "Do you go home to dinner?",
  "24365": "Tell me how and why am I again a prisoner?",
  "24366": "You intend to look after me, then?",
  "24367": "Is not my husband here?",
  "24368": "And is she gone?",
  "24369": "If he had been your own boy, you would have put him to it, just the same, I suppose?",
  "24370": "We asked who they were?",
  "24371": "Is there not one among them who has seen it all, and who knows it to be true?",
  "24372": "Or cold?",
  "24373": "Are you cold?",
  "24374": "What were the joy of man, what else could give him pleasure, but pretty maids and noble dames?",
  "24375": "Can you not be more definite?",
  "24376": "Who is she, or how did you get her?",
  "24377": "Tell me why you came?",
  "24378": "Or, shall we continue on our way?",
  "24379": "Do you hear the dog?",
  "24380": "Is his dog dead?",
  "24381": "With our business, how can we get away?",
  "24382": "And what is this?",
  "24383": "What will then become of me?",
  "24384": "You understand, don't you, that if she didn't do this there would be no knowing what she might do?",
  "24385": "Even in the midst of joy, may he not be permitted to be gloomy and oppressed?",
  "24386": "And what does his eminence think of this love, which is, by the bye, no secret to anybody?",
  "24387": "How do they act?",
  "24388": "Which do you like best?",
  "24389": "Have you seen the army?",
  "24390": "But what have I here said, that reflections very refined and metaphysical have little or no influence upon us?",
  "24391": "Fwhat?",
  "24392": "They grow out of our knowledge, ma'am?",
  "24393": "But could you think, because the nodding husband would not wake, that e'er the watchful lover slept?",
  "24394": "And the papers?",
  "24395": "Can you not come to me now, at once, before anything terrible happens?",
  "24396": "My card?",
  "24397": "Why, isn't it there?",
  "24398": "Well, this is strange news, isn't it?",
  "24399": "Tell me, I beseech you, what ails you?",
  "24400": "Of what race could these people be?",
  "24401": "Nevyedovsky?",
  "24402": "Where does your highness wish to go?",
  "24403": "And hasn't it now?",
  "24404": "Will not you, as well as your brother, intercede with your uncle in our behalf?",
  "24405": "Is SHE coming?",
  "24406": "Did you see her face?",
  "24407": "To love me, perhaps?",
  "24408": "In the first place, what proof have we of the fact?",
  "24409": "What are you trying to do?",
  "24410": "No right to be warden of the hospital, papa?",
  "24411": "When are we to discover them?",
  "24412": "Diamonds on the moon?",
  "24413": "What is your errand, then, with me, sir?",
  "24414": "Why is it that the dogs have failed to bark?",
  "24415": "And yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him?",
  "24416": "And do you think your power as great with the fraternity as monsieur le cure told me it was just now?",
  "24417": "And whose room is this, my dear child?",
  "24418": "And me?",
  "24419": "If that is the case, why wait till evening?",
  "24420": "What children?",
  "24421": "Won't you let me run you round in the car?",
  "24422": "Lemme go with you?",
  "24423": "Is there any other point which I can make clear?",
  "24424": "ITS DECISION WHAT is a battle?",
  "24425": "Do you mean to say it's not of importance?",
  "24426": "Must I speak again?",
  "24427": "You are not laughing?",
  "24428": "Is there any news today?",
  "24429": "Or a fairy in disguise?",
  "24430": "Bingley?",
  "24431": "Let's see it?",
  "24432": "How, got the start?",
  "24433": "Wot dye mean?",
  "24434": "You are going to leave us?",
  "24435": "Wherefore should we linger upon it now?",
  "24436": "But you'll do it?",
  "24437": "Which of my friends, my lord?",
  "24438": "Are you going for a walk?",
  "24439": "What am I going to say?",
  "24440": "What, monsieur, will you leave us so soon?",
  "24441": "You didn't find it then?",
  "24442": "It not the blood in your veins as warm as his?",
  "24443": "Why was it useless to try to win any one's favour?",
  "24444": "But in the face of all of them, whose voice appeals unto me?",
  "24445": "Imprimis, he is older than my father?",
  "24446": "What has been the result of the first war?",
  "24447": "And you have promised?",
  "24448": "Have you the money with you?",
  "24449": "So you were at the races, baron?",
  "24450": "Dolly, why have you disobeyed me?",
  "24451": "So, that's it, is it?",
  "24452": "Do?",
  "24453": "Do you not see them doing the same?",
  "24454": "Does the lady go with us, my father?",
  "24455": "Well, when you can combine patriotism and fun, isn't it all right?",
  "24456": "But if it kept her from being seasick it's a mercy I did prowl, isn't it?",
  "24457": "Never seen anchor weighed before?",
  "24458": "Do you burrow, or live in a tree?",
  "24459": "Where had he obtained that blouse?",
  "24460": "Sith then mine evil fortune would have it so, pray tell me, are any of the strangers still alive?",
  "24461": "Where's that?",
  "24462": "I don't suppose you intend to offer me your love?",
  "24463": "Some herb vodka?",
  "24464": "Nay?",
  "24465": "You hailed me, I think?",
  "24466": "Didn't you hear the cannon last night?",
  "24467": "And what do you want here?",
  "24468": "Is it a door with a lock to it?",
  "24469": "Is that honestly said?",
  "24470": "How could that be?",
  "24471": "And why should they not say so?",
  "24472": "Have you the diamond?",
  "24473": "Or the eastern?",
  "24474": "Is he aiming at doing anything, or simply undoing what's been done?",
  "24475": "Might he be called perfectly virtuous?",
  "24476": "But what else could she do?",
  "24477": "How ken I?",
  "24478": "Is such a hope justified?",
  "24479": "What could I be to a man who had ever gained heartfelt love from a faithful wife?",
  "24480": "Those old patriarchs lived to a jolly good old age, didn't they?",
  "24481": "For your sakes or my own?",
  "24482": "Then I suppose that we ought to do good to the just and harm to the unjust?",
  "24483": "Philip?",
  "24484": "And have no fear of afflicting and destroying beings who are so dear to you?",
  "24485": "When is property satisfied?",
  "24486": "How can the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall?",
  "24487": "How dare you?",
  "24488": "What about capitulation?",
  "24489": "Then would he descend to the south?",
  "24490": "Had he come home?",
  "24491": "All these days?",
  "24492": "*********************** A winged thing?",
  "24493": "Take fifty roubles for your cloak?",
  "24494": "Well, is she going to stay with him all day?",
  "24495": "What would it be?",
  "24496": "How will you forgive all my roughness in former days?",
  "24497": "By looks only?",
  "24498": "If I desert her, sir, do you suppose she forgets me?",

  "25295": "Any children?",
  "25296": "How is it distant?",
  "25297": "Which box do you mean?",
  "25298": "How can a system of education flourish that begins by so monstrous a falsehood, which the sense of hearing suffices to contradict?",

  "25310": "And does he catch plenty of fish?",
  "25311": "Did you ever stop to think of all the love letters that have been found after death?",
  "25312": "Why do you say that?",
  "25313": "What could she have to conceal from me whose happiness she knew principally consisted in that of herself and her daughter?",
  "25314": "You wouldn't care to go on board for the next trip, and have tea there?",
  "25315": "Do you expect news from him?",
  "25316": "Will you trust me?",
  "25317": "On what authority, then, do you venture to attack universal consent, and give the lie to the human race?",
  "25318": "Say, is it thus those honours you requite?",
  "25319": "Where is he who called me?",
  "25320": "May I not come near you?",
  "25321": "What are you doing for it?",
  "25322": "Father, you have trained me from my cradle?",
  "25323": "What do you say, then, to my right?",
  "25324": "Am I so like you?",
  "25325": "Who was there to teach him better, or where was it to be learnt?",
  "25326": "But what is so headstrong as youth?",
  "25327": "Who put that mouse in my desk?",
  "25328": "Had there been one touch of anger when she warded off thy threatened kisses?",
  "25329": "What of him?",
  "25330": "Do you do nothing but architectural sculpture?",
  "25331": "Har you a goin' to pay me?",
  "25332": "What nonsense?",
  "25333": "Have you not said that that abduction was entirely political?",
  "25334": "But what is the difference?",
  "25335": "Is that a friar passing?",
  "25336": "Why did you not listen to the counsels of your confessor?",
  "25337": "Is he quite well?",
  "25338": "Did he himself quite know what he meant?",
  "25339": "Do you suppose it does not give me pain to hear you thus spoken of with scorn?",
  "25340": "Well, don't you intend to bring me another plate?",
  "25341": "Are there exceptions to this proposition?",
  "25342": "What are you?",
  "25343": "Are they longing for another rule?",

  "25353": "Shall I show her in, madam?",
  "25354": "You grant me the text?",
  "25355": "If we had no war out of it when thus placed, wherein is the ground of belief that we shall have war out of it if we return to that policy?",
  "25356": "Don't you neglect him?",
  "25357": "Aren't you too, ferryman, a searcher for the right path?",
  "25358": "Why do you ask me such a question?",
  "25359": "Who was speaking?",
  "25360": "What defect?",
  "25361": "You're sure about the money?",
  "25362": "But why did you think about it, bishop?",
  "25363": "Then why, my friend, do you put on such a dismal countenance?",
  "25364": "What do you wish me not to have?",
  "25365": "Shall we be towed by him to the infernal world?",
  "25366": "Did I promise to wait for you at some barn?",
  "25367": "What makes you ask that?",
  "25368": "But will not papa tell you?",
  "25369": "Has he ever read my heart?",
  "25370": "What means this triple crest?",
  "25371": "Shall we remove it for this reason?",
  "25372": "What bags?",
  "25373": "Find food here?",
  "25374": "We began the war with this kind of spirit, why not end it with the same?",
  "25375": "Do you think they can hear that?",
  "25376": "How do you do, my dear son?",
  "25377": "That is to say, as a thinker who regards morality as questionable, as worthy of interrogation, in short, as a problem?",
  "25378": "Do you consent to the terms, and will you take the money?",
  "25379": "How does it begin?",
  "25380": "I say, what's to prevent our employing this worthy woman, your mother?",
  "25381": "What is more peaceful than the calm, even flowing of a river?",
  "25382": "Now, do you suppose he really has got hold of any other papers of importance, as he has boasted to you, since you have been such allies?",
  "25383": "They are all farmers, I suppose?",
  "25384": "And they were good to you?",
  "25385": "Are your horse's forelegs good?",
  "25386": "A favor from me?",
  "25387": "What are you now?",
  "25388": "What voice is this that has reached my ears?",
  "25389": "And you have fought often?",
  "25390": "Would not the mere circumstance of freight occasion a considerable deduction?",
  "25391": "Does your arm hurt you?",
  "25392": "And your police, they would interfere, would they not?",
  "25393": "Isn't that a kind of abstraction?",
  "25394": "But may I wait and reflect a little while?",
  "25395": "And should an immortal being seriously think of this little space rather than of the whole?",
  "25396": "Where has there been a murder?",
  "25397": "Monsieur has returned, then?",
  "25398": "Have you a factory in this place?",
  "25399": "And is it not clear that the one who feels the pain of forfeiture the most will be the one most grateful for the granting of the gift?",

  "25401": "Had it anything to do with father's making such a mommet of himself in thik carriage this afternoon?",
  "25402": "Has tha, begun tha' courtin' this early in th' season?",
  "25403": "What answer do you think I ought to make her?",
  "25404": "Who was its leader?",
  "25405": "Whence cometh our help?",
  "25406": "Whining are you?",
  "25407": "Dantes?",
  "25408": "Why don't you DO it?",
  "25409": "But, I say, what will my poor girl do, as to her part, with her own sex?",
  "25410": "Don't say anything, will you?",
  "25411": "Who dat?",
  "25412": "Do you know that your letter frightens me?",
  "25413": "Might I speak a word to you, my lady?",
  "25414": "And what do you do then?",
  "25415": "But in the midst of their perplexity, what sound was that which startled them?",
  "25416": "Would not this tinker be a good recruit?",
  "25417": "Saving money?",
  "25418": "What would any be but odd men and they living lonesome in the world?",
  "25419": "Can such opponents stand when we assail?",
  "25420": "When does she try to avoid society, or appear restless and dissatisfied in it?",
  "25421": "What do they say?",
  "25422": "Can I hope?",
  "25423": "Why do not you oftener make use of copper?",
  "25424": "It's all arranged about bringing off the swag, is it?",
  "25425": "Will you warrant him sound, wind and limb?",
  "25426": "And now, doctor, how about money, eh?",
  "25427": "You've had him once, and what has he done for you?",
  "25428": "Is I heah, or whah IS I?",
  "25429": "Ellen, what do you think?",
  "25430": "Why any fear of detection?",
  "25431": "You've noticed that, too?",
  "25432": "What shall we see?",
  "25433": "Why not make one's own fashions?",
  "25434": "And why are they here at this time?",

  "25436": "Do you see the likeness?",
  "25437": "How can any one expect that any one else will ever trust a lawyer again after that?",
  "25438": "Who's to put it out?",
  "25439": "Are we no longer on speaking terms?",
  "25440": "And what good thing is there beyond that we may gain by length of days?",
  "25441": "Has she a recognized knight, then?",
  "25442": "From whom does he borrow?",
  "25443": "Which does she mean?",
  "25444": "And does that not go a long way?",
  "25445": "Don't you remember?",
  "25446": "Why not accept the whole of history?",
  "25447": "Would you believe that?",
  "25448": "And if the dead were conscious would they be pleased?",
  "25449": "But who knows what the sly man may not pick up?",
  "25450": "Who can they be?",
  "25451": "If I meet you by chance, there is no concealment in that?",
  "25452": "Why make her stand all that time at the crossing?",
  "25453": "Does he ask his information?",
  "25454": "Did you ask how much?",
  "25455": "What do you mean by more time?",

  "25463": "You, who are never afraid of living men, what do you fear from the dead?",
  "25464": "Boy, would you have him live to dishonor these gray hairs?",
  "25465": "And don't you think he knows that?",

  "25474": "And what had you to report?",
  "25475": "I suppose I may come over and see you if I'm good?",
  "25476": "I don't see why you sign your letter in such a new and terribly formal way?",
  "25477": "But how will you make yourself proof against calumny?",
  "25478": "Ada is well?",
  "25479": "Is it only chance?",
  "25480": "When shall we be led to the field of battle?",
  "25481": "But tell me, are you printing this book at your own risk, or have you sold the copyright to some bookseller?",
  "25482": "And are you sure that it did not?",
  "25483": "This what you want?",
  "25484": "What cheer?",
  "25485": "Did you find the journey tiring?",
  "25486": "In what seas chiefly?",

  "25494": "We three?",
  "25495": "What are you studying?",
  "25496": "Why not six square acres, while you're about it?",
  "25497": "Cold, isn't it?",
  "25498": "Then I am to conclude that you decline to do anything?",
  "25499": "Who shall dare to say that the sun is false?",
  "25500": "What do you say?",
  "25501": "How, how?",
  "25502": "Do you think he meant anything, dear?",
  "25503": "And whom do you accuse?",
  "25504": "And what does he say?",
  "25505": "What other gratification?",
  "25506": "In the first place, is it positively true that the king has given it to him?",
  "25507": "Is it a pain in your stomach, master?",
  "25508": "Have you been to the general?",
  "25509": "How does the same principle, rigorously followed to its conclusions, lead to effects diametrically opposite?",
  "25510": "Wasn't he to be at the council?",
  "25511": "What have you done, ever done, that hasn't been FOR me?",
  "25512": "Do you want me to go away?",
  "25513": "Which door?",
  "25514": "What noise d'ye mean?",
  "25515": "What would be the use of carrying so much more weight?",
  "25516": "You remember what happened, eh?",
  "25517": "May not a body see her?",
  "25518": "Which are they?",
  "25519": "Then you haven't quarrelled?",
  "25520": "But you absolve me from all other sins, why not from that?",
  "25521": "Well, now, what do you say to a cart?",
  "25522": "Why so soft, so submissive and yielding?",
  "25523": "Your WHAT?",
  "25524": "Or to drown kitlings?",
  "25525": "WHAT IS A MAN'S PROPERTY?",
  "25526": "What d'you think it is?",
  "25527": "How are we going to pay it?",
  "25528": "You haven't, I rather gather, particularly liked your country?",
  "25529": "Nine folks out of ten would own 'twas going too far to dance then, I suppose?",
  "25530": "Madam, do you cut little children's things?",
  "25531": "Why did he let me come here?",
  "25532": "And who are your companions?",
  "25533": "In the presence of witnesses?",
  "25534": "Should she indeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and denounce the murderer?",
  "25535": "Was she not here, put absolutely in his path?",
  "25536": "Suppose one of the company should call for a glass of wine, how will you behave?",
  "25537": "Do you observe it?",
  "25538": "How should we accomplish this?",
  "25539": "In gastronomy?",
  "25540": "Ah, his friend is with him?",
  "25541": "Isn't it strange how safe other people's adventures seem after they happen?",
  "25542": "What, what?",
  "25543": "Had I unwittingly provoked this fit of anger?",
  "25544": "And these roses, the fairest that ever were seen?",
  "25545": "Why should I marry him?",
  "25546": "Wait upon them?",
  "25547": "And why were you so affected at that story, or rather fable, which the count related?",
  "25548": "But suppose they fight?",
  "25549": "The first week, did you say?",
  "25550": "What about women?",
  "25551": "Then shall we fight courageously with them?",
  "25552": "Thereby it asked, in less general terms, what was the cause of the social evil, and what was its remedy?",
  "25553": "Who was it guessed right this time?",
  "25554": "Does the virtue consist in the metaphor, or in the man?",
  "25555": "Think you that a thern would demean himself by labour?",
  "25556": "Can you point it out to me?",
  "25557": "Does my country need a victim?",
  "25558": "What do you call this?",
  "25559": "But is he really a prince?",
  "25560": "Shall we have it here instead of in my house?",
  "25561": "Don't you hear?",
  "25562": "Roots an' all?",
  "25563": "What on earth would we want them for?",
  "25564": "How was that?",
  "25565": "And he the speaker?",
  "25566": "Why, too, had he pretended they were not his when I had remarked about them at first?",
  "25567": "How could you be so simple?",
  "25568": "Might he not as well come as send?",
  "25569": "What friends?",
  "25570": "Why don't you tell him about them?",
  "25571": "Can no accident, no unforeseen circumstance, snatch it from us?",
  "25572": "Would they keep me long enough to spend seven shillings?",
  "25573": "Do you think it will work?",
  "25574": "What mean you, sirrah?",
  "25575": "Is she fair now as she lies?",
  "25576": "Have you a winged horse, then?",
  "25577": "Where is the bundle we sent down before us?",
  "25578": "Why should he be dragged from a career he liked in a place he loved, into a career he detested, in a place and climate he shunned?",
  "25579": "He eats, then?",
  "25580": "The hatchway?",
  "25581": "What does he care?",
  "25582": "Where does that door lead to?",
  "25583": "A widow, I think?",
  "25584": "And did he die that night?",
  "25585": "Is not all weeping complaining?",
  "25586": "Have you come out of the water?",
  "25587": "But what were the metes and bounds of this province which had been so often bought and sold?",
  "25588": "Again, would you choose an occasion when you are known to be in the house, when a servant has let you in?",
  "25589": "Heavens, what is that?",
  "25590": "He is going to return to it immediately, is he not?",
  "25591": "Can you have any doubt of this?",
  "25592": "But you are expecting other guests, aren't you?",
  "25593": "Is the machine yours?",
  "25594": "You demanded a favor?",
  "25595": "Where, then, did the hospital defaulters get their drink?",
  "25596": "But what has become of my father there, then, all these two years?",
  "25597": "At the castle?",
  "25598": "Is there no passage inside the door, then?",
  "25599": "Yet again, who shall judge me?",
  "25600": "And shall we revisit together a hapless spot, that proved so fatal to many of our former brave companions?",
  "25601": "Why do you want to know the name of my clerk?",
  "25602": "Why don't you run and jump?",
  "25603": "Is it possible?",
  "25604": "To what, then, are we indebted for our safety?",
  "25605": "Their lower parts?",
  "25606": "Upon your honour?",
  "25607": "Am I wanted for anything?",
  "25608": "What difference can the man make to her?",
  "25609": "You find it a tiresome subject?",
  "25610": "And when you speak of music, do you include literature or not?",
  "25611": "And what would it be to me if you were to be hanged?",
  "25612": "Do you sigh?",
  "25613": "Think you so?",
  "25614": "But once he was married, what would become of this narrow margin of life in which his real experiences were lived?",
  "25615": "Have you been here ever since?",
  "25616": "What would you do with him, now?",
  "25617": "Can he, then, be trusted with the government of others?",
  "25618": "Do they not owe their lives to you?",
  "25619": "Well, sir, what do you require of me, and what document is it that you wish to be drawn up?",
  "25620": "Is the sleeper the leafless forest or the bare earth of winter?",
  "25621": "What are their names?",
  "25622": "What's here?",
  "25623": "On the trolley lines?",
  "25624": "Is not our engineer alive?",
  "25625": "Are you very anxious to know, countess?",
  "25626": "Why do you not wish to speak out now?",
  "25627": "You have a sister?",
  "25628": "And who, then, was fleeing in that manner?",

  "25631": "You WILL, will you?",
  "25632": "Won't he, my dear?",
  "25633": "Shall we one day meet again?",
  "25634": "Is there any one in view at present?",
  "25635": "Would he live until the next day, until that third attack which must infallibly carry him off?",
  "25636": "Whether he believed it was dangerous?",
  "25637": "Or give her a little laudanum?",
  "25638": "And he was ruined?",
  "25639": "Sail across the fjord on a night like this?",
  "25640": "Or what lion lieth on the path?",
  "25641": "Has he been good?",
  "25642": "Well, and has your daughter been to see you lately?",
  "25643": "About a year, isn't it?",
  "25644": "Did you hear all this construed last time or not?",
  "25645": "Who under such circumstances would not have taken it for a gigantic cetacean?",
  "25646": "Does your majesty wish to know my opinion?",
  "25647": "Why was I born?",
  "25648": "I suppose it is a matter of testimony?",
  "25649": "Why in the world?",
  "25650": "What would you not have accomplished if you had been free?",
  "25651": "Do you feel an inclination to part with him?",
  "25652": "A crook?",
  "25653": "Is the whole of her?",
  "25654": "Will you have enough to buy in anywhere else?",
  "25655": "And by what path?",
  "25656": "Why should you place it to your account?",

  "25658": "What did you do then?",
  "25659": "You would like to return to your people?",
  "25660": "Suppose I should tell you wrong?",
  "25661": "What mystery was here?",
  "25662": "Slight, do you say?",
  "25663": "Are we to regard him as a mere lawless egoist, or as something more?",
  "25664": "You'll stay with me, won't you?",
  "25665": "Do you know yourself what you looked like?",
  "25666": "I asked myself had these latter things indeed happened?",
  "25667": "You were not awake an hour ago?",
  "25668": "What rigging do you keep 'em in?",

  "25670": "Now how am I to sign?",
  "25671": "Is he still here?",
  "25672": "Our little question itself?",
  "25673": "But, since we grow hourly in knowledge, must not at last all things be known?",
  "25674": "Shall I become like that again?",
  "25675": "Do you fleece 'em?",
  "25676": "What would you have, my dear fellow?",
  "25677": "What are you running away for?",
  "25678": "Mamma, one need not be ashamed of his being a widower?",
  "25679": "So you have come home, expecting him here?",
  "25680": "And mine?",
  "25681": "Still, if you prefer another name, what shall it be?",
  "25682": "Wherein is a victory more certain by your plan than mine?",
  "25683": "Would you not rather have wine, father?",
  "25684": "Are you ready?",
  "25685": "Or does it correspond to a moral meeting of the waters in his own mind?",
  "25686": "What is the good of working?",
  "25687": "What need had she either for secret meetings?",
  "25688": "What shall I say?",
  "25689": "Have you definite news of it?",
  "25690": "Real women?",

  "26889": "Would you ring the bell, please?",
  "26890": "You have achieved it?",
  "26891": "Oh, have you?",
  "26892": "And do not the two styles, or the mixture of the two, comprehend all poetry, and every form of expression in words?",
  "26893": "What are you going to do, my lord?",
  "26894": "Are we to do nothing, then?",
  "26895": "Told you so, didn't I?",
  "26896": "Have done, shipmate, will ye?",
  "26897": "The whole truth?",
  "26898": "What more desirable or more essential than this quality in the governors of nations?",

  "26900": "What is your name, dear?",
  "26901": "Governor, why stand you all so pitiless?",
  "26902": "Suppose we say a little something down, and a fuller discussion of the matter later?",
  "26903": "What call you the lord of the castle, sweet face?",
  "26904": "Is the exchange an equitable one?",
  "26905": "What do they care for but money?",
  "26906": "What is it you stare at?",
  "26907": "But you have promised not to go until she comes?",
  "26908": "But what is a cable's length?",
  "26909": "And we'll be in a friendly country?",
  "26910": "What in the world does that mean?",
  "26911": "D'you mean to say they're worth nothing at all?",
  "26912": "What is the use of counting on any success of mine?",
  "26913": "But who were the victors?",
  "26914": "When are you coming out?",
  "26915": "Can you be with us?",
  "26916": "So he is a very good father, is he?",
  "26917": "What do you recognize?",
  "26918": "Where did they draw the treacle from?",

  "26923": "Who's brought it?",
  "26924": "Who were you then?",
  "26925": "What DID you do, you naughty, bad thing?",
  "26926": "What do you think of those fellows yonder?",

  "26936": "Couldn't they see better if they was to wait till daytime?",
  "26937": "Have I gone through all this to fail at the last?",
  "26938": "What, with that face?",
  "26939": "Beyond the mountains, who knew what and whence I was?",

  "26947": "How much time have I lost by illness?",
  "26948": "If it ain't no good to swear by, what do you suppose a sperrit would give for it?",
  "26949": "Lend a hand to the girl, can't you?",
  "26950": "Is it enough merely to love if one cannot put all the poetry and all the music of heaven and earth into love?",
  "26951": "The next thing is for us to go and wish 'em joy, I suppose?",

  "26956": "Tom, have you said to any one that we made a visit to those people, and that we saw those three together?",
  "26957": "And what had I better do about it, sir?",
  "26958": "Why don't they?",

  "26966": "But was it possible for him to be brave when he was by himself, face to face with his soul, or would he then surrender to despair?",
  "26967": "Why long for a life which could be for him now only an isolated, desolate, and gloomy one?",
  "26968": "Could we not bail her out?",
  "26969": "How shall we prevent a conflict between charity and judgment?",
  "26970": "What have I all along maintained?",
  "26971": "Disko, what did you pick me up for?",
  "26972": "American, wasn't he?",
  "26973": "How will you take it, ungrateful brute?",
  "26974": "Why, then, suppose now an inertia which definitions contradict, now an external potentiality which nothing proves?",

  "26980": "Is this the language of a rational man?",
  "26981": "Well, and how did the ring come into your possession?",
  "26982": "What should I have done as soon as I was hard and fast here?",
  "26983": "Why had not you as good do it?",
  "26984": "Am I going, or not, to my ruin?",
  "26985": "And who is ever silly enough to complain of it?",
  "26986": "But what sort of a way is that for bones to lie?",

  "26991": "Well, why have I worried him, for five years, and never let him go free?",
  "26992": "But meantime, how am I to get on with my washing?",
  "26993": "Are there then chains for two which are forged on high?",
  "26994": "Then why don't you go?",
  "26995": "How could you have gone away and left me?",
  "26996": "Yes, child, but why don't we take him into the parlour, now that we've got a nice parlour for company?",
  "26997": "Is any better than experience and wisdom and reason?",
  "26998": "But can that which is neither become both?",
  "26999": "But he really is disinterested, and above small jealousy and spite, I have heard?",
  "27000": "And he rests now, near his companions, in the coral cemetery?",
  "27001": "What are we to do, now?",
  "27002": "And now, where is he gone?",
  "27003": "Do you not need to mitigate the struggle for existence more sanguine than the war of weapons?",
  "27004": "When will he come back?",
  "27005": "Suppose you haven't?",
  "27006": "Is it me, yer reverence?",
  "27007": "And why should I not dare?",
  "27008": "And is he in love perchance?",
  "27009": "Surely, this was not the only cause of estrangement?",
  "27010": "Where had he heard the name before?",
  "27011": "Where's my mother?",
  "27012": "Ah, isn't my whole point that he's charming to her?",
  "27013": "Were you looking for us?",
  "27014": "But tell me, and tell me true, what is the meaning of all this feasting, and who are these people?",
  "27015": "Has it begun?",
  "27016": "Where are you taking me?",
  "27017": "What's all this?",
  "27018": "Shall you be present in the reception room?",
  "27019": "What was the matter?",
  "27020": "What magazine, or treasury of bliss?",
  "27021": "What do I think?",
  "27022": "Ah, why DID he?",
  "27023": "How could I ask you to gif up so much for a poor old fellow, who has no fortune but a little learning?",
  "27024": "To whom, think ye, is your life of such consequence, that they should seek to bereave ye of it?",
  "27025": "Is it quite certain?",
  "27026": "Isn't that true, doctor?",
  "27027": "Clayton?",
  "27028": "Why do you not think so?",
  "27029": "And you will permit me to accompany you?",
  "27030": "And when he doesn't say pretty things?",
  "27031": "And you can refuse, you mean, eh?",
  "27032": "Sure, amn't I never done at the drunken bowsy ever since he left school?",
  "27033": "What, then, was there left to do?",
  "27034": "What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed?",
  "27035": "Are you so sure?",
  "27036": "Is that too simple a source of pleasure for some to prize?",
  "27037": "Then you knew her before?",
  "27038": "Have you not asked papa for money?",
  "27039": "Is there anything whimsical about me?",
  "27040": "Wouldn't it be nice if it could last?",
  "27041": "Is this ingratitude, however?",
  "27042": "For nothing?",
  "27043": "The winch, you say?",
  "27044": "Was ever a man in such a fearful fool's position?",
  "27045": "But this kind man who has done so much will, I am sure, take you right on to my house?",
  "27046": "But if no one among us is capable of governing himself, then who among us has the capacity to govern someone else?",
  "27047": "Was personal happiness the aim and object of their ambition?",
  "27048": "Have you ever seen a wire jacket?",
  "27049": "Cranmer awaits us in the private chapel?",
  "27050": "And how about today's telegram?",
  "27051": "Where had that daring singer got to?",
  "27052": "Was it he who threw us that bottle, when the vessel made her first cruise?",
  "27053": "You didn't mean to ask that?",
  "27054": "Brilliant?",
  "27055": "Getting a little beyond our depth, dear, aren't we?",
  "27056": "Now, what is competition?",
  "27057": "Why didn't you come near us all these three days, eh?",
  "27058": "Do you know that you are speaking to me quite as a friend?",
  "27059": "What do you do then?",
  "27060": "Do you think we live as cheaply as we might?",
  "27061": "You haven't opened the parcel and swallowed one or two as you come along, have you?",
  "27062": "Surely there are classified lists?",
  "27063": "Why ride into the middle of the battalion?",
  "27064": "May I ask if you can confirm these statements?",
  "27065": "Is not this an infallible and sovereign antidote?",
  "27066": "Well, what's this now?",
  "27067": "Isn't it fortunate I've got such an imagination?",
  "27068": "Now, what have we a right to possess?",
  "27069": "A cigarette?",
  "27070": "But what did he do, my dear?",
  "27071": "What act?",
  "27072": "What in thunder is it?",
  "27073": "And the man?",
  "27074": "How am I to understand you, mon pere?",
  "27075": "Why dilate upon what everybody knows?",
  "27076": "Might this be for you, sir?",
  "27077": "How can you learn lessons in here?",
  "27078": "Who be these?",
  "27079": "Do you love my son?",
  "27080": "Who gets up in the gray dawn to call on another man's wife?",
  "27081": "What follows that angel?",
  "27082": "Will it strengthen our families and support our children?",
  "27083": "Why where should I leave them but where I found them?",
  "27084": "Shall he now be arrested in his desolating career?",
  "27085": "Do you know what that means?",
  "27086": "But why should I make a long story of it?",
  "27087": "Mightn't I stay and sleep with you tonight, grandmother?",
  "27088": "Are you not jealous at all?",
  "27089": "And is not the chief object of vanity, our bravery or learning, our wit or breeding, our eloquence or address, our taste or abilities?",
  "27090": "Jo, I hope you haven't done anything rash?",
  "27091": "And do you believe it to be so?",
  "27092": "Do you take milk in yours?",
  "27093": "What fiend is this?",
  "27094": "Where are they?",
  "27095": "Would any one believe it?",
  "27096": "What if I've accepted too passively the funny form of our life?",
  "27097": "What, indeed, can tend to deprave the character more than outward submission and inward contempt?",
  "27098": "If they bite and kick?",
  "27099": "Is there that about me that should affright a man?",
  "27100": "For how can any experience be adequate with an idea?",
  "27101": "What is this I hear about you?",
  "27102": "How old are you, dear?",
  "27103": "I wonder if they made that fearful sound I heard just before you came?",
  "27104": "What made them kick you out?",
  "27105": "Am I allowed to repeat it?",
  "27106": "I think that this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with me for six o'clock?",
  "27107": "Have you any dice in your pocket?",
  "27108": "What on earth put such a notion into your head?",
  "27109": "None belonging to your father?",
  "27110": "What had he to say?",
  "27111": "Owing to him?",
  "27112": "To me, sir?",
  "27113": "What do you suppose she wants to talk about tomorrow?",
  "27114": "Would he say a lie?",
  "27115": "How much money had these men fraudulently obtained?",
  "27116": "How many have you loved?",
  "27117": "Then why, when you were able to run away, did you go back to him?",
  "27118": "And don't you think the governor ought to let me have it?",
  "27119": "You are alone?",
  "27120": "What are your favourite flowers?",
  "27121": "Why didn't I go in then?",
  "27122": "By your misfortune?",
  "27123": "Now are you satisfied?",
  "27124": "Who is your lady friend with the big grey envelope and the fat monogram outside?",
  "27125": "Have you got them?",
  "27126": "Did you get lost?",
  "27127": "I wonder how he felt when he heard it?",
  "27128": "What need for weapon?",
  "27129": "'Ow many times have I got to tell you to be careful of them plates?",
  "27130": "Weevle?",
  "27131": "What you're after, why you left the block house, why you given me that there chart, I don't know, now, do I?",
  "27132": "Are we falling?",
  "27133": "And by character?",
  "27134": "And would not a really good education furnish the best safeguard?",
  "27135": "What manner of man are you?",
  "27136": "I think you are growing less cool, my friend, and are beginning to be a trifle surprised, aren't you?",
  "27137": "And that one?",
  "27138": "Has he ever taken from the rich that he did not give again to the poor?",
  "27139": "Has your mother relented at last?",
  "27140": "What do you want to do?",
  "27141": "Is this all your spinning, grandmother?",
  "27142": "What sort of ship?",
  "27143": "And do they not share?",
  "27144": "Why isn't it enough?",
  "27145": "Shall I meet strange, heavenly things?",
  "27146": "Didn't I see him seize your hand?",
  "27147": "What is that thing?",
  "27148": "But who else?",
  "27149": "Why, how?",
  "27150": "Do you hear, my children?",
  "27151": "Can you deny that all that was craft and deceit and fraud and greed?",
  "27152": "How shall we set about it?",
  "27153": "Not too difficult?",
  "27154": "Were his father's religious devotion, his teachers warnings, his own knowledge, his own search able to keep him safe?",
  "27155": "Should they be embarked?",
  "27156": "Is my experience but of yesterday?",
  "27157": "Can I trust in you?",
  "27158": "Are you in earnest?",
  "27159": "Where are you to go?",
  "27160": "Do you want to earn half a crown?",
  "27161": "Wilcox?",
  "27162": "What do I mean?",
  "27163": "But will no one remain in the house, my lord?",
  "27164": "How, then, with these variations and with revenues so uncertain, can we establish even distribution and uniform wages for laborers?",
  "27165": "Of the hearses?",
  "27166": "But will you not drink with me, sir?",
  "27167": "What avail is it?",
  "27168": "Don't you see them?",
  "27169": "Oh, I must, hey?",
  "27170": "Or are they both in this their own reward?",
  "27171": "Said ye not truly, aforetime, that we should live and meet?",
  "27172": "What do we do?",
  "27173": "How will you live?",
  "27174": "Why don't you fall yourself?",

  "27180": "Where shall I see the head of him which contrived to murder his father, which I will tear to pieces with my own hands?",
  "27181": "Why this absence of mind, and sweet irresolution?",
  "27182": "We better than you?",
  "27183": "Did this mad wife of his carry it off with her?",
  "27184": "Had the man seen through him?",
  "27185": "But will you promise to have me took there, sir, and laid along with him?",
  "27186": "But if I do not marry?",
  "27187": "Why did he interfere with me, and fill your mind with such falsehood?",
  "27188": "But when one has no experience, how can one tell what is sickness and what is health?",
  "27189": "How can you tell who is poor?",
  "27190": "Is it so precious?",
  "27191": "Why am I to be disturbed?",
  "27192": "Will you take my advice?",
  "27193": "Something important?",
  "27194": "Perhaps you think I am mad, eh?",
  "27195": "Shall you have the courage?",
  "27196": "Will you forget him?",
  "27197": "Wait for you?",
  "27198": "Now, what fault can you point out in him?",
  "27199": "CUI BONO?",
  "27200": "Where had the dragon gone in such a short space of time?",
  "27201": "You've got a friend here?",
  "27202": "What has he made you?",
  "27203": "You keep the registers of entries and departures?",
  "27204": "To what tribe do they belong?",
  "27205": "I don't suppose that you have noticed it?",
  "27206": "Couldn't you ask him here dinner or something?",
  "27207": "And then?",
  "27208": "What does your wife want?",
  "27209": "Couldn't you wish to be married to him yourself, if that was the case?",
  "27210": "It was his life or mine, but far more than that, it was his life or hers, for how could I leave her in the power of this madman?",
  "27211": "Then there is a truth I don't know?",
  "27212": "How did I get hold of that?",
  "27213": "Whatever is the matter?",
  "27214": "And it is true that you did not set it on fire?",
  "27215": "Has anything unpleasant happened since I saw you?",
  "27216": "Is it believed that axioms in metaphysics, declarations of right, harangues from the tribune, will put a stop to the disbanding of an army?",
  "27217": "What does not a man undergo for the sake of a cure?",
  "27218": "Shan't you?",
  "27219": "You a member here?",
  "27220": "What is your own experience of him?",
  "27221": "But aren't you mistaken in thinking that you wouldn't force him, wouldn't punish him?",
  "27222": "Me, young ladies?",
  "27223": "What are these corruptions?",
  "27224": "Doesn't he?",
  "27225": "Why must he look farther than their platform when he claims himself to stand by his platform?",
  "27226": "Now, surely, if he takes so warmly to people who are not related to him at all, may he not take as warmly to his own kin?",
  "27227": "Not since the humour of gentility was upon you, did you?",
  "27228": "Governor come round?",
  "27229": "That boy's tutor?",
  "27230": "What is a soul?",
  "27231": "And with our wives?",
  "27232": "Who would think of plotting with a poor little weak creature like me?",
  "27233": "What is his exact kin to us, mother?",
  "27234": "Is this a new brand of humour?",
  "27235": "Yes, what were we talking about?",
  "27236": "Do I know them?",
  "27237": "And what business have you here?",
  "27238": "You know who bricks and mortar is, I suppose, sir?",
  "27239": "Oh, what's the use of me saying anything?",
  "27240": "I make the first advances?",
  "27241": "Why strive for the knowledge of things if we become more cowardly thereby?",
  "27242": "Why, how do you come to be here?",
  "27243": "What the devil is he doing here?",
  "27244": "What's he to do with the lassie?",
  "27245": "Why must people kneel down to pray?",
  "27246": "Do you like him?",
  "27247": "First tell the boys, what we have decided?",
  "27248": "What is it to be?",
  "27249": "Tell us, dear, what do the creatures look like?",
  "27250": "Do you see that whale now?",
  "27251": "How is it that there are birds enough ready to replace immediately a lost mate of either sex?",
  "27252": "You admit, I hope, that I have a right to speak about what concerns the dignity of my wife's sister?",
  "27253": "Will somebody hand me anything hard and bruising to pelt at her?",
  "27254": "Is he industrious at his work and respectful to you?",
  "27255": "That's the way the song runs, isn't it?",
  "27256": "Could her face inspire passion at all now?",
  "27257": "Why ought I to know?",
  "27258": "And you are not furious?",
  "27259": "Will you let me go away?",
  "27260": "John, why don't you say something?",
  "27261": "But what shall I tell the dairyman's wife?",
  "27262": "And you don't know what they do it for?",
  "27263": "Or at some public school, perhaps?",
  "27264": "They do, do they?",
  "27265": "Is not the night mournful, sad, and melancholic?",
  "27266": "I asked them, if they were at liberty to tell me the truth of what they were to do with me?",
  "27267": "Why are you sorry, sir?",
  "27268": "What prison is he in?",
  "27269": "Shall we go on, your excellency, fine champagne?",
  "27270": "Leave our brother to come to us?",
  "27271": "Will you really not have tea?",
  "27272": "Whom do you expect to find here?",
  "27273": "Have you no other to propose?",
  "27274": "What can a writer, who professes scepticism, have in common with radical views?",
  "27275": "See that blue dory behind him?",
  "27276": "But is an education which ignores them all a liberal education?",
  "27277": "What upon?",
  "27278": "But who has told you?",
  "27279": "Where are my priwileges?",
  "27280": "Well, did she say what she was coming for?",
  "27281": "How can I ever thank you?",
  "27282": "You own the name and renounce the alias?",
  "27283": "Is he of noble family, and rich?",
  "27284": "How then are we to begin our strike to destroy him?",
  "27285": "Who is this boy?",
  "27286": "And who hit you at all?",
  "27287": "What are these men's leading principles, and about what kind of things are they busy, and for what kind of reasons do they love and honor?",
  "27288": "Thornfield?",
  "27289": "May I ask if you are very busy just now?",
  "27290": "How can it concern him to learn how the self came to be what it is, or what it will be in the distant future?",
  "27291": "You think it will?",
  "27292": "But why should I weary you with details?",
  "27293": "So you kept him after all?",
  "27294": "And the queen?",
  "27295": "That we see before our noses?",
  "27296": "Can I never tell my story in a plain, straightforward way?",
  "27297": "Can competition in labor be abolished?",
  "27298": "You cannot help us?",
  "27299": "But what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance?",
  "27300": "What was the use of his being somewhere in the neighbourhood if she had no means of knowing where she could find him?",
  "27301": "You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?",
  "27302": "You will protect me from him?",
  "27303": "Had you heard?",
  "27304": "Can you remember that?",
  "27305": "Ever live by cheating at play?",
  "27306": "Why do you permit such a surgeon to have the care of the sick, wounded, and dying soldiers?",
  "27307": "And is that why he hits her?",
  "27308": "Why, what is there to understand?",
  "27309": "Yet you have a large establishment, too, I am told?",
  "27310": "And you think that I am going to send you back to that world which must know me no more?",
  "27311": "What is done to infanticides in this country?",
  "27312": "And did you see anyone?",
  "27313": "Well, then, what makes you talk so wild?",
  "27314": "You have formed one, then?",
  "27315": "Will you please pardon my rudeness?",
  "27316": "My dear father, may I beg you to prepare your mind for what I am going to say?",
  "27317": "With what my father said just now?",
  "27318": "What did you think of that, sir?",
  "27319": "Would you like me to sit down for a minute or two?",
  "27320": "He is going with you, is he not?",
  "27321": "Of what disposition is he?",
  "27322": "What is it, then?",
  "27323": "Where did you really get them?",
  "27324": "Mark must be here, yet why doesn't he answer me?",
  "27325": "What did you expect to gain by that?",
  "27326": "What heart can hold?",
  "27327": "Had he left her there to her fate in the lonely jungle?",
  "27328": "How do you do, all of you?",
  "27329": "Do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not talk as fast, and admire what she admires as rapturously as herself?",
  "27330": "Curious?",
  "27331": "Do you intend to sit up for me?",
  "27332": "But would the man acknowledge the relation?",
  "27333": "What are you doing now?",
  "27334": "Do you suppose that if I had made such a revelation to the king, I should have been alive now?",
  "27335": "He had a passion for pictures, and why should he not be able to paint as well as anybody else?",
  "27336": "Are you the gentleman who caused the accident?",
  "27337": "And the pay?",
  "27338": "Husband?",
  "27339": "I know what everyone would say is the right thing to do, but what do you say?",
  "27340": "What difference can it make to you?",
  "27341": "How could he know what comes from a woman's wavering sympathies, what from her inborn coquetry, and what from love itself?",
  "27342": "Was he a proprietor, or only a usufructuary?",
  "27343": "Wasn't that nonsensical?",
  "27344": "You have sold all your clothes?",
  "27345": "Surely you learnt that too?",
  "27346": "WHAT is it?",
  "27347": "But at this moment who knows if we may not be frightfully crushed between the two glassy surfaces?",
  "27348": "We must take care that that affair comes off all right, must we not?",
  "27349": "Why do you shake me like that?",
  "27350": "Now really should a cock be brought into a tragic play?",
  "27351": "Is his thread spun?",
  "27352": "Have not you an intimate friend?",
  "27353": "But how, and wherewith?",
  "27354": "That was a very different account of matters, was it not?",
  "27355": "What laws mean you?",
  "27356": "And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps?",
  "27357": "And on what will you sleep?",
  "27358": "That is what comes of your gospel of love, is it?",
  "27359": "Beautiful?",
  "27360": "Didn't say nothin' 'bout my old man, s'pose?",
  "27361": "Is it really possible that perfectly innocent people are kept here?",
  "27362": "You know the road?",
  "27363": "So if I say they're gone, you'll bear me witness, will you?",
  "27364": "Why should you not mention the sum?",
  "27365": "They're quite neat and decent, aren't they?",
  "27366": "To what a devil, then, said he, serve so many paltry heaps and bundles of papers and copies which you give me?",
  "27367": "How did you get such small small legs?",
  "27368": "But why shouldn't they petition, doctor?",
  "27369": "What is that news?",
  "27370": "His nieces accompany him, no doubt?",
  "27371": "Well, but whom are you attacking?",
  "27372": "Am I fool?",
  "27373": "What should hinder it?",
  "27374": "Is this true, my pulse?",
  "27375": "Have you given in your resignation, mademoiselle?",
  "27376": "How can you make yourself so inferior to me, as to show such a bad spirit?",
  "27377": "How can that be managed?",
  "27378": "When shall we be able to fish again?",
  "27379": "And what may your purpose be, most lofty lady?",
  "27380": "And when the better part of their products are consumed by others at the play, do you assure me that their families are not in want?",
  "27381": "Do I combine?",
  "27382": "What good was there in doing that?",
  "27383": "How can you do it seriously?",
  "27384": "Read?",
  "27385": "Was I absurd?",
  "27386": "Live like this?",
  "27387": "And if I could, what comfort to me?",
  "27388": "Aglaya, may I kiss YOUR prince?",
  "27389": "You mean to ask, I said, what will be our answer?",
  "27390": "You do not mean to inherit that infamous crotchet my brother has got into his head?",
  "27391": "Not a circus?",
  "27392": "Well, what have you got in your ear?",
  "27393": "What came of it?",
  "27394": "What makes it smell so funny?",
  "27395": "Which way are you going?",
  "27396": "Sure, little woman?",
  "27397": "The boy's, then?",
  "27398": "How d'you account for the general indifference, then?",
  "27399": "Why do you delay?",
  "27400": "Proud, eh?",
  "27401": "Since no man has aught of what he leaves, what is't to leave betimes?",
  "27402": "How is he?",
  "27403": "Were there not the brilliant particles of a halo in the air about his head?",
  "27404": "I therefore turned towards him with a stern countenance, and asked, who he called fool?",
  "27405": "What should ye have in common with cats and wolves?",
  "27406": "You want me to swear?",
  "27407": "What you standing there for?",
  "27408": "Perhaps he is just as fond of suffering?",
  "27409": "What's the matter with you, old man?",
  "27410": "Married woman, I believe?",
  "27411": "Will you grant it to me?",
  "27412": "And the chin, with its dimples, as in health, might it not be hers?",
  "27413": "What will happen then?",
  "27414": "You mean that the thing is supernatural?",
  "27415": "And if I do speak to her, my lord, what then?",
  "27416": "Was it sufficient?",
  "27417": "Have you ever committed a sin?",
  "27418": "Presented to whom?",
  "27419": "Not for myself?",
  "27420": "Well, sir, will you go?",
  "27421": "Where did you go?",
  "27422": "What have we done?",
  "27423": "Do you jog hither, wagging your tails, to pant at my wine, and bepiss my barrel?",
  "27424": "What was going on in congress?",
  "27425": "Do you need a doctor?",
  "27426": "Why, oh why, have I betrayed myself?",
  "27427": "Had he any intellect, any thinking faculty, any consciousness of his own existence?",
  "27428": "Outspoken, is she?",
  "27429": "Is it honouring your husband to dishonour his business?",
  "27430": "To whom resort for relief?",
  "27431": "What must be done then?",
  "27432": "Are yours like that?",
  "27433": "And now, are you aware of one thing, monsieur?",
  "27434": "Is he on this farm?",
  "27435": "Now, did you not think so?",
  "27436": "What do men know about women's martyrdoms?",
  "27437": "What can be done?",
  "27438": "What are you going to do if you don't get work?",
  "27439": "Is the room to be got ready upstairs?",
  "27440": "Will you be silent?",
  "27441": "But how could she?",
  "27442": "Don't you all despise me for not stealing, when it would have been only justice?",
  "27443": "How shall I bring forth my wife?",
  "27444": "And the greater the interval which separates them from philosophy and reason, the more strange and illusive will be the pleasure?",
  "27445": "Does he also desire his archic man to be got up in a manner befitting royalty at a certain date?",
  "27446": "What can I do for you, my child?",
  "27447": "Well, the question is, what do you know about her?",
  "27448": "What was the chief trade in this place?",
  "27449": "Suppose that she coulde pittie me, what then?",
  "27450": "Where is the child?",
  "27451": "What will you take?",
  "27452": "But who could have foreseen such an attention as this?",
  "27453": "Do you know I have entrusted him with our secret?",
  "27454": "Your sister is dead, then?",
  "27455": "What have I done to displease you?",
  "27456": "How begot, how nourished?",
  "27457": "What was the good of playing?",
  "27458": "Would she not be marvellously fair to look upon when in happy mood, seeing that she is so fair in her displeasure?",
  "27459": "Any youngsters?",
  "27460": "Can a man who possesses the slightest common sense be so unreasonable?",
  "27461": "Have you kept him in the cellar all this time?",
  "27462": "Did either of you boys touch it?",
  "27463": "Why has HE done nothing?",
  "27464": "Arrest you, my most faithful servant?",
  "27465": "Might be a pun on my pottering about here, mightn't it?",
  "27466": "Why did she betray the two of them so terribly, in embracing the glow of the evening?",
  "27467": "Are you a missionary?",
  "27468": "And in what condition?",
  "27469": "What haven't you, love, said in your time?",
  "27470": "Did they have any repinings because of their course?",
  "27471": "You understand what I mean?",
  "27472": "And why shouldn't I?",
  "27473": "You serve the cardinal?",
  "27474": "Where is his pistol?",
  "27475": "What DOES it call itself, I wonder?",
  "27476": "Was she not very much surprised?",
  "27477": "But what is that blockhead of a benevolent gentleman doing?",
  "27478": "And how do you know my heart is innocent?",
  "27479": "Shall I leave you?",
  "27480": "So what does it matter?",
  "27481": "Or whether we should hold that cowardice makes no difference in the end, seeing that we all must share alike?",
  "27482": "Now, do you find the business good, and the investment advantageous?",
  "27483": "And I dare say you sing a little, too?",
  "27484": "Was she normal?",
  "27485": "Are their heads off?",
  "27486": "This page or this page?",
  "27487": "What kind of a man is he?",
  "27488": "Will you tell me how that came about?",
  "27489": "For how can we know all the possible cases that may arise?",
  "27490": "But now I have told you, you don't think it wrong of me, do you?",
  "27491": "And why should she expect her brother to do that which her brother's guests would decline to do?",
  "27492": "What was there in the young girl's glance on this occasion?",
  "27493": "And then, why did he not at least answer it?",
  "27494": "But where are they, then?",
  "27495": "And then he can write back to my address, and I can smuggle the letter to you?",
  "27496": "Won what, ma'am?",
  "27497": "What dreadful thing drives her to say this, father, when it is such a pain to her?",
  "27498": "How long would the race endure if the parental instinct were wholly lacking?",
  "27499": "Don't you dance?",
  "27500": "What then, my gentle sister?",
  "27501": "Which of the two will be the first to fall?",
  "27502": "Was this the right corner to turn?",
  "27503": "What are we?",
  "27504": "Who of you have done more?",
  "27505": "Get it?",
  "27506": "Whose hand's out?",
  "27507": "Alas, do you love nothing else in me?",
  "27508": "Shall we send the watch there?",
  "27509": "Would you mind my taking 'em out and looking at 'em for a minute, to see how they are made?",
  "27510": "Would you believe it?",
  "27511": "But you were married?",
  "27512": "Jespersen?",
  "27513": "Is papa alive?",
  "27514": "How is she?",
  "27515": "What do the overhanging warehouses make of that?",
  "27516": "Mathematics?",
  "27517": "But is it so?",
  "27518": "And with whom?",
  "27519": "Don't you see, you brute, that my dog is a lurcher?",
  "27520": "What has it turned to, then?",
  "27521": "What would she say if she knew the truth?",
  "27522": "Don't you see you are the very one to bring yourself and family here?",
  "27523": "You loved your mother, then?",
  "27524": "I wonder what we both did that for?",
  "27525": "Damn you, sir, will you let me look inside that cab?",
  "27526": "Is there no voice in your mother's heart that forbids you to destroy your son's ideals?",
  "27527": "Been havin' a snooze, ole boy?",
  "27528": "Have you the tact?",
  "27529": "I could even go with you now?",
  "27530": "What shall you wear?",
  "27531": "How large is the garland?",
  "27532": "You are wrong, and what can you do better with your leisure hours?",
  "27533": "What did you do next?",
  "27534": "Well, where are you taking me, then?",
  "27535": "What was it he talked about?",
  "27536": "Will it hold water?",
  "27537": "Is this the missis?",
  "27538": "How shall the lots be drawn?",
  "27539": "Cannot make you understand WHAT?",
  "27540": "What'll they think of us?",
  "27541": "Who would have believed it?",
  "27542": "What means this woman?",
  "27543": "And turn all the people of the villages against us?",
  "27544": "What's the matter with the old man attending to him personally?",
  "27545": "Would you like supper?",
  "27546": "What do you say, monsieur?",
  "27547": "Do you want to know what it is in him?",
  "27548": "And why would you either?",
  "27549": "Will you wait here?",
  "27550": "Doctor seen them?",
  "27551": "So there's nothing?",
  "27552": "And shall we eat bread?",
  "27553": "Ankle all right, eh?",
  "27554": "But who was she?",
  "27555": "Why should there often be so great a difference in the result of a reciprocal cross between the same two species?",
  "27556": "Is there any better or equal hope in the world?",
  "27557": "But I wanted to ask you directly what you think of me, of my life?",
  "27558": "Of course, if one doesn't go to a public school those sort of schools are the next best thing, aren't they?",
  "27559": "Are you quite impervious to good advice?",
  "27560": "Captain's a great feller, ain't he?",
  "27561": "What is the matter with me?",
  "27562": "Did you see herself?",
  "27563": "Are we lovers?",
  "27564": "And how could you think o' going to the pond, and taking your sister where there was dirt?",
  "27565": "Against D'Artagnan?",
  "27566": "What lineage, what lineage?",
  "27567": "Did you post that letter yourself?",
  "27568": "But is it a kind heart?",
  "27569": "Shall we descend to the party at all?",
  "27570": "You are not playing with us?",
  "27571": "What other view could he have?",
  "27572": "And because you fear that it may be?",
  "27573": "Such a thing as a what?",
  "27574": "Are you trying to find out something bad about me?",
  "27575": "You lost your school and good income through her, did you not?",
  "27576": "Shall I take her to a coach?",
  "27577": "Was it his profile that was seen on the blind two nights before?",
  "27578": "When you became engaged to the young lady whom you have just mentioned, did you make a regular proposal to her family?",
  "27579": "Can tha' read?",
  "27580": "Do all astronomers admit the existence of this satellite?",
  "27581": "What were we created for?",
  "27582": "Is there any drinkable wine in your tavern?",
  "27583": "To my lady's?",
  "27584": "Society?",
  "27585": "Was he the only passenger who came on board at that untimely hour?",
  "27586": "Did you take part in the campaign?",
  "27587": "Aren't you going to take a practice then?",
  "27588": "Alone?",
  "27589": "Did you groan?",
  "27590": "Is he not a handsome man?",
  "27591": "Why pique all mortals, yet affect a name?",
  "27592": "Can you come directly?",
  "27593": "Have you never heard these respectable men, when they got home again, talking about the way in which immorality runs rampant abroad?",
  "27594": "Did I think she was alive?",
  "27595": "Won't that make a queer combination?",
  "27596": "Haven't you got it on now?",
  "27597": "About the way in which we've treated that angel of a girl?",
  "27598": "By nothing?",
  "27599": "You watch while I sleep and you have come to bring me some news?",
  "27600": "Then why did ye not seek him there?",
  "27601": "And what object or consideration more pleasing than this can be presented to the human mind?",
  "27602": "Where did you go to school?",
  "27603": "Did you see the exquisite old lace she sent me?",
  "27604": "Which was first, thirst or drinking?",
  "27605": "What had become of him?",
  "27606": "Expectations?",
  "27607": "You are?",
  "27608": "Lan?",
  "27609": "Shall she giggle or grin?",
  "27610": "How can we not always think of her?",
  "27611": "YOU of importance to him in any way?",
  "27612": "Nor sold him anything, perhaps?",
  "27613": "Do you wish me to tell you it is good?",
  "27614": "Will you excuse me if I leave you for half an hour?",
  "27615": "What is to do?",
  "27616": "Who told you that?",
  "27617": "You can't see me home if that's what you mean?",
  "27618": "Does your majesty wish for your attendants at once?",
  "27619": "Will your business take long to state?",
  "27620": "Yes, dear boy?",
  "27621": "If we jest at them, what will our servants do?",
  "27622": "Have you tried him on the subject?",
  "27623": "Some of you gentlemen going to play for me this evening?",
  "27624": "Why, yes, didn't you know?",
  "27625": "May he, mother?",
  "27626": "Were?",
  "27627": "Why hush?",
  "27628": "Where are you off to now?",
  "27629": "Who nailed him?",
  "27630": "Have you no clue, can you suggest no clue, to their recovery?",
  "27631": "What may be your calling?",
  "27632": "What the value of those literary charms which are absolutely destroyed by their enjoyment?",
  "27633": "Has not that fire, that lies harmless and unseen in the sticks, the power to consume the whole country?",
  "27634": "You would often see him?",
  "27635": "How must I quit her?",
  "27636": "Can it be that it is all over?",
  "27637": "And, he will come presently?",
  "27638": "What did he say to you?",
  "27639": "Old frippery?",
  "27640": "If you loose dem now how you tink you feel den?",
  "27641": "Wasn't it worth the whiskey?",
  "27642": "Shall I tell him you're here?",
  "27643": "If his purpose were innocent, why did he not say so?",
  "27644": "Why did you keep me standing there in the cold?",
  "27645": "Now, the means of realizing these contradictory characteristics?",
  "27646": "What do you make of all this?",
  "27647": "What was the consequence?",
  "27648": "I s'pose you remember that you saw me this afternoon, an' somebody told you that I was goin' to join the circus, didn't they?",
  "27649": "Have we not raised it?",
  "27650": "Do you think, then, that any harm can have happened to him?",
  "27651": "Have these birds come to contend for the double stadium prize?",
  "27652": "You think, then, that the case is hopeful?",
  "27653": "Then why did you say you had business with the general?",
  "27654": "What was the extraordinary catastrophe that had transformed her?",
  "27655": "But what is that in the distance?",
  "27656": "Are we not here?",
  "27657": "Then how doth one know there was poison given at all?",
  "27658": "Why, bless you, child, what are you thinking of?",
  "27659": "It may well be asked, could such artistically shaded ornaments have been formed by means of sexual selection?",
  "27660": "What business has a pick and a shovel here?",
  "27661": "You'd have come here?",
  "27662": "After all, who among you will be in a position to guarantee payment if all the flocks die?",
  "27663": "So now, sir mechanic, the terms?",
  "27664": "Is the dear old lady dead?",

  "28061": "Why didn't you tell me that at first?",
  "28062": "How then should the news alluded to have escaped me?",
  "28063": "Well, captain?",
  "28064": "Why should he be pacing his room all the time?",
  "28065": "Oh well, lend me five bob, will you?",
  "28066": "Sucking his drink?",
  "28067": "But have you no relatives?",
  "28068": "Does the comparison require much time or labor?",
  "28069": "How much did it cost you?",
  "28070": "Who are you going to tackle first?",
  "28071": "Have a drink with you?",
  "28072": "What more?",
  "28073": "Then why have you come back at ALL?",
  "28074": "Has that dog stopped shivering yet?",
  "28075": "D'ye feel brave men, brave?",
  "28076": "Can't you take leave?",
  "28077": "Under what circumstances did you see him?",
  "28078": "Did master sleep well?",
  "28079": "Did they come ashore here?",
  "28080": "And from what?",
  "28081": "But do you know who that lady is you talk about in such a fashion?",
  "28082": "But what is the matter, my boy?",
  "28083": "And you fancy he will not put his maxim into execution, now that he has got hold of the king?",
  "28084": "A dog has got under my bed?",
  "28085": "And where is the governor?",
  "28086": "His sister worked also but what could she do with seven little children?",
  "28087": "That can't be wrong, can it?",
  "28088": "Save me from death?",
  "28089": "My brother?",
  "28090": "Or, did he stop after the last hecatomb?",
  "28091": "Don't you think I deserve another kiss, then?",
  "28092": "Was she, or is she, mad, or what sort of horrible danger is it?",
  "28093": "What is there about me to make a wonderful girl love me?",
  "28094": "Had he not been supremely successful?",
  "28095": "Who stopped him?",
  "28096": "Can't you fancy the conclusions he'll draw?",
  "28097": "And what say you to that?",
  "28098": "Why don't you pad?",
  "28099": "Then, where are you now?",
  "28100": "You wouldn't think we'd keep you over time, now, would you?",
  "28101": "Am I to call in any assistance, or is the trick done?",
  "28102": "Why can't you be rational?",
  "28103": "And half of what you had was hers?",
  "28104": "What must they think as they see us sailing in the air?",
  "28105": "Now, will you come upstairs?",
  "28106": "A lump of wax?",
  "28107": "Do you know what it means?",
  "28108": "Is anything the matter, sir?",
  "28109": "Do you think you'll be able to get through?",
  "28110": "Is there no guarantee for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness?",
  "28111": "Then why DO you wait?",
  "28112": "Do you think he is hopeful?",
  "28113": "What will be the conclusion?",
  "28114": "And with you, ma'am?",
  "28115": "Just thinking what?",
  "28116": "You know the contents of this letter, no doubt?",
  "28117": "What do you wonder at?",
  "28118": "Who made these dissimilarities?",
  "28119": "A miser?",
  "28120": "Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the hangman who would gain his fee?",
  "28121": "You know what I mean?",
  "28122": "Can you read it?",
  "28123": "What med you be up to?",
  "28124": "D'you reckon he knowed anything?",
  "28125": "Suppose we sell off all the horses, and sell one of your farms, and pay up square?",
  "28126": "What if he should be no gentleman now, but a clown indeed, lady?",
  "28127": "Who, his parents?",
  "28128": "May I go with you?",
  "28129": "Do you see it?",
  "28130": "Where can you begin?",
  "28131": "Will your eminence please read and examine?",
  "28132": "Why, how in the nation did they ever git into such a scrape?",
  "28133": "Where did the shipwreck occur?",
  "28134": "Did one ever hear of such a thing?",
  "28135": "Is anything the matter?",
  "28136": "What you demand of me is serious, then?",
  "28137": "What then, in the name of heaven, could you go to war for?",
  "28138": "Surely there is no danger of anything so dreadful?",
  "28139": "What must one day come and may not pass by?",
  "28140": "Well, madame?",
  "28141": "Have you got the cartridges?",
  "28142": "To go with you for?",
  "28143": "Don't you think that is extraordinarily generous?",
  "28144": "Is there no debt to pay, no boon to grant?",
  "28145": "You don't expect anybody to believe this, about the lady and the sovereign, do you?",
  "28146": "Then, perhaps, you cannot tell me what sort of a woman she is?",
  "28147": "Ye are frightened?",
  "28148": "But how in the world did you know that he was in the house at all?",
  "28149": "May I venture to congratulate you?",
  "28150": "A successor?",
  "28151": "Shall not we two lie on the bridal bed this same night?",
  "28152": "Did all enjoy it?",
  "28153": "Don't you use a study?",
  "28154": "Isn't it damp?",
  "28155": "How was it wrought to such perfection?",
  "28156": "Am I likely to be frozen?",
  "28157": "A presentation?",
  "28158": "Does he wish it?",
  "28159": "Why did you?",
  "28160": "The decline of his fortunes, then?",
  "28161": "What was the cause of such degeneration?",
  "28162": "They are coming, then?",
  "28163": "How can you talk about shame, papa?",
  "28164": "Who is to throw a stone?",
  "28165": "How so, my pet?",
  "28166": "Ambulance or train?",
  "28167": "Dare I ask you to explain?",
  "28168": "Only what are we to talk about?",
  "28169": "Again, if there be nothing real in the universe, what is it that causes unreal objects to appear?",
  "28170": "What do you want of me?",
  "28171": "Not the old business?",
  "28172": "Somebody was coming?",
  "28173": "Mad one, what have I said?",
  "28174": "Do you know I am dissatisfied with your younger son?",
  "28175": "In pain, where?",
  "28176": "Doth it long for knowledge as the lion for his food?",
  "28177": "But what other ways?",
  "28178": "So I come and take, and what do I do?",
  "28179": "But why have you no packing bag?",
  "28180": "He does your bidding?",
  "28181": "Had he not better take the big umbrella?",
  "28182": "But of what?",
  "28183": "Shall you be there, sir?",
  "28184": "You didn't know him, did you?",
  "28185": "Mamma, are you asleep?",
  "28186": "Have I not, sir?",
  "28187": "And so many children poor?",
  "28188": "At least, what?",
  "28189": "Are not the roofs and the lintels wet?",
  "28190": "At what time did he go?",
  "28191": "Perfectly plain, isn't it?",
  "28192": "Then how could they tear me pitilessly from all that was dear to me, and lock me up in prison like a wild animal?",
  "28193": "And who's to make him?",
  "28194": "How did the boat strike when she went in?",
  "28195": "How hight she?",
  "28196": "You understand what I mean?",
  "28197": "But is not war an art?",
  "28198": "Postponed?",
  "28199": "She is, is she?",
  "28200": "Who is fit for it?",
  "28201": "Do you not as a rule think women below your notice as companions?",
  "28202": "Will you tell me where the BRITANNIA was wrecked?",
  "28203": "What chance had they against one who, if she had a mind, could put by out of her income twice as much as they, poor women, could spend?",
  "28204": "What mede is aye to live in comfort?",
  "28205": "Who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads?",
  "28206": "Who's over me?",
  "28207": "Why, in the devil's name, have they served me thus?",
  "28208": "You know her husband, of course?",
  "28209": "Is it possible that the meaning of life was not disclosed to him before he died?",
  "28210": "Are you brutes?",
  "28211": "Think it'll ride?",
  "28212": "What'll the other people in the house say to my being here?",
  "28213": "But was it all there was of life?",
  "28214": "What private box?",
  "28215": "Nor written?",
  "28216": "Would I not give all that I have of strength at one blow if I could open his eyes to see as I see but for one minute?",
  "28217": "Consequently, a capital blade?",
  "28218": "And break it out?",
  "28219": "He has the horse, then?",
  "28220": "You're not sorry you've come, are you?",
  "28221": "The entrance cannot be easy?",
  "28222": "Why do I not give it?",
  "28223": "And does that hinder you from letting me know the second reason?",
  "28224": "Clarence?",
  "28225": "Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy?",
  "28226": "Why did you play us such a trick, damn you?",
  "28227": "What is his object?",
  "28228": "What would happen next?",
  "28229": "Who might do this but the women?",
  "28230": "Why don't you scream?",
  "28231": "Do you know that?",
  "28232": "Why, my dear friend, do I not see you?",
  "28233": "But, in truth, what is the good of these disguises?",
  "28234": "Will that restore it to sight?",
  "28235": "Where is this person?",
  "28236": "What can a man spend his ha'pence on here in this country hole?",
  "28237": "Catharine, did I do wrong?",
  "28238": "How much are you out of pocket?",
  "28239": "What has become of her?",
  "28240": "Could we advertise, then, asking for information from wharfingers?",
  "28241": "Does this infinite awaken in us the idea of essence, while we can attribute to ourselves only the idea of existence?",
  "28242": "We will say ten o'clock then?",
  "28243": "To its honors, to its flowers, to its golden aspirations?",
  "28244": "But always smelling those leather books, what can be expected?",
  "28245": "Is it not time for a change?",
  "28246": "What did happen to me?",
  "28247": "Do you think now that I shall tell you what motive he had had in starting out?",
  "28248": "You perhaps think I should have expected this refusal?",
  "28249": "And your cargo?",
  "28250": "You do like me a bit, don't you?",
  "28251": "What's the game?",
  "28252": "Not related to her, sir?",
  "28253": "But, they say, is that true right, social right, fraternal right?",
  "28254": "Do you know, sir, that that man did all this?",
  "28255": "Did he give you anything else?",
  "28256": "Why should he die, for he felt that he could not live, under such a weight of obloquy?",
  "28257": "It's he then who has told you?",
  "28258": "Is that all?",
  "28259": "Took?",
  "28260": "How much do you know?",
  "28261": "Out of your own pocket?",
  "28262": "Why was it none would give it, then?",
  "28263": "Shall they be banished from the district, or from the whole land?",
  "28264": "Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?",
  "28265": "Did I abuse you?",
  "28266": "And who wants to be acquainted with you?",
  "28267": "What can you do?",
  "28268": "Are you in love with the cows?",
  "28269": "Not to her uncle?",
  "28270": "Why should it not, at a certain depth, attain an impassable limit, instead of rising to such a point as to fuse the most infusible metals?",
  "28271": "But why have you done it at all?",
  "28272": "Haven't you noticed it?",
  "28273": "And what does this groom do?",
  "28274": "Sun in your eyes and his face in the shadow?",
  "28275": "Would she hear of his being slapped and beat by drummers demnebly?",
  "28276": "Who did all that mischief?",
  "28277": "Ain't we gotta live?",
  "28278": "Are we at the pole?",
  "28279": "Do you hear, do you hear what he says?",
  "28280": "Don't you think you could find some work to do?",
  "28281": "Was he again to be disturbed?",
  "28282": "Was she going to act and keep house?",
  "28283": "But why does he have this idea of a horse?",
  "28284": "Was that his work or was it possibly the doing of someone who was bent upon counteracting his schemes?",
  "28285": "Two minutes wrong?",
  "28286": "Do you not guess, monsieur?",
  "28287": "Where's your horse?",
  "28288": "Will you give me something to eat and a bed?",
  "28289": "What would they do to assist them?",
  "28290": "Let us have the land?",
  "28291": "Does he ever pay the rent for you?",
  "28292": "Might I ask you, sir, to pacify my mind?",
  "28293": "It is difficult to rise above the jungle standards and reason by the light of civilized ways, is it not, my friend?",
  "28294": "What about your government and all this treatment?",
  "28295": "What the devil are you doing?",
  "28296": "What help is to be hoped for, what consolation, what solace?",
  "28297": "Or, may we not owe their visit to the dead colt?",
  "28298": "Where shall we search for him?",
  "28299": "Why should you keep such things from me?",
  "28300": "Physiology not an experimental science?",
  "28301": "What about the dough?",
  "28302": "Can she have loved my brother so little as to be able to forget him so soon?",
  "28303": "It wasn't then that she told you?",
  "28304": "What thing?",
  "28305": "Do you suppose she takes you for a symbol?",
  "28306": "No worse news of master, I hope, sir?",
  "28307": "Has she run away because we are come?",
  "28308": "Shall I tell her or not?",
  "28309": "But then, why had he permitted that man to leave him alive?",
  "28310": "What's that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for?",
  "28311": "On which of these actions did he reflect with the most pleasure, when he was summoned by the angel of death?",
  "28312": "How shall I don't?",
  "28313": "What was in there?",
  "28314": "But tell me, what is she?",
  "28315": "Wouldn't you like to be king of that splendid fairyland?",
  "28316": "Is he ungrateful to no one else?",
  "28317": "Aye, how do you know he is?",
  "28318": "Does our friend eke out his modest income with a crossing?",
  "28319": "The stag spoke?",
  "28320": "What are the dangers which menace us?",
  "28321": "Monsieur does not then renounce his excursion for this evening?",
  "28322": "You imagine, I dare say, that you invented something quite new?",
  "28323": "Why shouldn't she win?",
  "28324": "Is there anything in what I say, or am I talking to no purpose?",
  "28325": "Was he already with the queen?",
  "28326": "What is the matter, that with all his ill usage of me, I cannot hate him?",
  "28327": "Now, I beseech you, do tell me, have you ever attended to their pairing and breeding?",
  "28328": "Oh, what have I done to be blessed with such friends?",
  "28329": "Two one pound notes, or friends?",
  "28330": "Can it be that the dog has not understood his master?",
  "28331": "Why indeed should they maintain a watch?",
  "28332": "What was I to do?",
  "28333": "So will you abandon your plan?",
  "28334": "What can I say that will enable you to understand the depth of my sorrow?",
  "28335": "Did she still love him?",
  "28336": "What you 'bout?",
  "28337": "And of the pleasures of love, and all other pleasures, the same holds good?",
  "28338": "What does she want?",
  "28339": "You needn't go yet, need you?",
  "28340": "Will it be safe to leave you there alone?",
  "28341": "How many things she knows, doesn't she?",
  "28342": "In your room?",
  "28343": "Then you won't forgive me?",
  "28344": "Can dignity of mind exist with such trivial cares?",
  "28345": "Ah, friends, do ye divine also my heart's double will?",
  "28346": "Who was th' lad what carried th' flag?",
  "28347": "Are they dead, ma'am?",
  "28348": "And what shall we have in lieu of it?",
  "28349": "It is a lovely night, and why should we not prolong our ride a little?",
  "28350": "Will she then have sufficient native energy to look into herself for comfort, and cultivate her dormant faculties?",
  "28351": "You will not come?",
  "28352": "For arrears of pay?",
  "28353": "Copperfield, my dear fellow, how do you do?",
  "28354": "And is the city which is under a tyrant rich or poor?",
  "28355": "Was it not too clear that, let the matter go how it would, there was no happiness in store for her?",
  "28356": "Would you kindly send one of your constables for two buckets of water?",
  "28357": "But what is there, then, above the sun?",
  "28358": "How is it you don't know?",
  "28359": "Why are they not given up to the church, as they ought to be?",
  "28360": "But you, d'Artagnan, what is the matter with you, and what has happened to you personally?",
  "28361": "To conceal his name?",
  "28362": "Is it at some set season?",
  "28363": "Did she know anything of his life upon the sea?",
  "28364": "Where is so awful a responsibility laid upon them?",
  "28365": "Well, my boy, what's there to prevent you?",
  "28366": "What more natural, after this, than the dream which came to him?",
  "28367": "If vices be genuine and virtue a deception, as you think, why do you call the inventors of that deceiving art sages?",
  "28368": "Has the law any eyes to witness your grief?",
  "28369": "How can I be vain when I know I'm homely?",
  "28370": "The little girl?",
  "28371": "Kicked on that occasion for cheating at dice?",
  "28372": "What proofs do you require?",
  "28373": "On business, eh?",
  "28374": "Why, what's happened?",
  "28375": "Not hurt you, did I?",
  "28376": "Was it the time the sandy cat walked round the balustrade?",
  "28377": "What insults, girl?",
  "28378": "And how does any one know whether he will stay days, months, or years?",
  "28379": "Well, how are you going to get out of that?",
  "28380": "Have you your stethoscope?",
  "28381": "Well, where can we find it?",
  "28382": "Was it mere social effect, fulfilment of ambition in the social world, in the community of mankind?",
  "28383": "How about this ad of yours?",
  "28384": "Do you still suppose that I am a boy ignorant of my own mind, and mistaking the impulses of my own soul?",
  "28385": "Must we then not be married, in order to sanctify the union of our hearts?",
  "28386": "Ay, but will you promise to come?",
  "28387": "What did you write about?",
  "28388": "Perhaps you are laughing again?",
  "28389": "So you think that these people have already quitted the island?",
  "28390": "What's a lad with good friends doing as loblolly boy?",
  "28391": "Who can tell if that mind, when the touchstone is applied to it, will not be found of a mean and vulgar character?",
  "28392": "But what time's breakfast, sir?",
  "28393": "Did you signal us, lording?",
  "28394": "Where was you raised?",
  "28395": "May I read it?",
  "28396": "Where is the treasure?",
  "28397": "You know?",
  "28398": "Snatch at it?",
  "28399": "Well, what say you to a friend that would take this bitter bargain off your hands?",
  "28400": "Just step into this corner a moment, will you?",
  "28401": "What will you do, dear?",
  "28402": "Who shall prevent him?",
  "28403": "Is it a profession?",
  "28404": "You admit you owe him three pounds then for a month's board?",
  "28405": "Have I not found her friendless, and cold, and comfortless?",
  "28406": "Is he learned?",
  "28407": "Ay, where are they?",
  "28408": "Who is there?",
  "28409": "Why should he feel joy at turning back?",
  "28410": "Must I really?",
  "28411": "And shall I not do as the first man?",
  "28412": "Thy work, the KARMA?",
  "28413": "It's queer, isn't it?",
  "28414": "Was I not a fool, when I refused to look at or speak to him?",
  "28415": "And may we say that this has been proven?",
  "28416": "Does she cook the dinner?",
  "28417": "How do you come to know it?",
  "28418": "She was confined at your house, was she not?",
  "28419": "Then why didn't you come to me to wipe them for you?",
  "28420": "Do you know who I am?",
  "28421": "Very well what did I say to you?",
  "28422": "Father, have you any objection to my going away?",
  "28423": "And you are afraid I shall be unhappy?",
  "28424": "To reign in my place and stead?",
  "28425": "I suppose?",
  "28426": "Does the day look clear again?",
  "28427": "What if I were to think a little about others?",
  "28428": "Why on earth did you shut yourself in?",
  "28429": "Do you really suppose?",
  "28430": "Why one to come and one to go?",
  "28431": "Is not that the bishop?",
  "28432": "Why will you ruin yourself, your family, and nation?",
  "28433": "Why such a hard sentence?",
  "28434": "Will he not fancy that the shadows which he formerly saw are truer than the objects which are now shown to him?",
  "28435": "May I go and see her?",
  "28436": "Where did you go this morning?",
  "28437": "So very soon?",
  "28438": "Well, sir, in writing against property, have I done more than quote the language of history?",
  "28439": "I unhappy?",
  "28440": "But do I see a handkerchief?",
  "28441": "But how did he come by his death?",
  "28442": "Can you believe it?",
  "28443": "But if you have big ideas you have to use big words to express them, haven't you?",
  "28444": "Do you think that was done last night?",
  "28445": "Which is the way to the chapel?",
  "28446": "May we, then, be permitted to speak of the past in the present?",
  "28447": "What victim?",
  "28448": "Do we not own the country?",
  "28449": "Raoul, did you ever see anybody hung?",
  "28450": "May I be permitted a word or two of advice?",
  "28451": "If not, where's he gone?",
  "28452": "What would they think of me?",
  "28453": "What says the abbe?",
  "28454": "Might it not be that she would calculate that an interview would thus be possible?",
  "28455": "Why linger to add to the number of the victims of our merciless enemies?",
  "28456": "What is bad?",
  "28457": "And what now?",
  "28458": "Was he actually in hiding from the police?",
  "28459": "Shall he in the meantime risk the character and interest of the nation in the hands of men to whom he can not give his confidence?",
  "28460": "What's the meaning of this?",
  "28461": "In the first place, what is the gentleman's name?",
  "28462": "Don't you want to go out, and walk around the moon, and pick up diamonds?",
  "28463": "But how was it possible to effect this?",
  "28464": "Will you let me?",
  "28465": "And look you, lord, times are not ill, so wherefore should I risk a change of days?",
  "28466": "That certainly seems a satisfactory explanation, does it not?",
  "28467": "Why, I suppose you'll make a dive for a hatful of diamonds, won't you?",
  "28468": "You have my birth certificate?",
  "28469": "Isn't this mattress hard enough, and the room dull enough, and pain bad enough, but THEY must torture me?",
  "28470": "Is it an odd speech, papa?",
  "28471": "Why don't we go in with them?",
  "28472": "Had you not observed it before?",
  "28473": "Then why didn't I sneeze?",
  "28474": "Who would attend him when he was sick?",
  "28475": "Till to your very doors the war be brought?",
  "28476": "A sleeping draught?",
  "28477": "Philip?",
  "28478": "But they may come any moment, for you left word that I awaited them?",
  "28479": "Why, indeed?",
  "28480": "Shall you?",
  "28481": "But how came the hand to discompose you so much, if it was only a letter of business?",
  "28482": "Why did this sudden conviction of a religious woman cast a terrible doubt in my mind?",
  "28483": "Was that then he or an inhuman thing moved by a lower soul?",
  "28484": "And the power which the eye possesses is a sort of effluence which is dispensed from the sun?",
  "28485": "What was one to think or feel?",
  "28486": "Can you tell the position of the rooms?",
  "28487": "To defend ourselves against attack?",
  "28488": "The child?",
  "28489": "You will marry me, won't you?",
  "28490": "When shall I have the answer, monseigneur?",
  "28491": "But where does it stay?",
  "28492": "D'you like that?",
  "28493": "You know that to be so?",
  "28494": "Was it possible to render any aid to the dying man?",
  "28495": "Widowed mother, perhaps?",
  "28496": "Has she mentioned me lately?",
  "28497": "And what your sorrow?",
  "28498": "Did you speak, my own?",
  "28499": "Is it only a voice?",
  "28500": "Why wonder about this?",
  "28501": "Did he not advertise?",
  "28502": "In what manner?",
  "28503": "What would they do if they found me?",
  "28504": "But how can I pay them?",
  "28505": "How was this done?",
  "28506": "Away from me?",
  "28507": "And, if so, surely there is good material in you?",
  "28508": "It was he did that, and amn't I a great wonder to think I've traced him ten days with that rent in my crown?",
  "28509": "What was the matter with you, baron?",
  "28510": "May I have the honour?",
  "28511": "Will you come into the garden?",
  "28512": "Will it satisfy them, in the future, if we have nothing to do with invasions and insurrections?",
  "28513": "But what are we to do with her when we have caught her?",
  "28514": "And what do you say of lovers of wine?",
  "28515": "Where now the splendid future of her poor duped children?",
  "28516": "So that is what you wanted the money for?",
  "28517": "Would you like to take her place?",
  "28518": "Was it in the papers yet?",
  "28519": "Who lives to the left there?",
  "28520": "Where shall we have tea?",
  "28521": "Would she ever die?",
  "28522": "And had the leather interior lasted with the felt cap through seven centuries?",
  "28523": "But why should anyone take it in order to keep it in his house?",
  "28524": "What will happen now?",
  "28525": "Next, how can the posting be accomplished in these mountainous parts?",
  "28526": "Does your soul belong to him now?",
  "28527": "How is man to know?",
  "28528": "And what can I do for you, esteemed prince?",
  "28529": "But this letter in which he recommends you to me?",
  "28530": "What are bulbs?",
  "28531": "Would you like to ferry me over?",
  "28532": "I hope your respected father is well, sir?",
  "28533": "And what, my lord, has been my fault?",
  "28534": "Then what is the illness itself?",
  "28535": "Is that what you've been so funny about this evening?",
  "28536": "But you are half asleep, are you not?",
  "28537": "Of whom?",
  "28538": "And suppose I were to die?",
  "28539": "I wonder where they do go, by the by?",
  "28540": "Is the well where you got this water near at hand?",
  "28541": "And does your honor know the four men who undertook to rescue him?",
  "28542": "Did you still hear the knocking?",
  "28543": "But to what place was I to go?",
  "28544": "Would you work for four and a half a week?",
  "28545": "You have a child?",
  "28546": "Doesn't the name of the country strike you even in the mere mention of it?",
  "28547": "How shall we punish him for such a speech?",
  "28548": "What can be plainer than that the webbed feet of ducks and geese are formed for swimming?",
  "28549": "The sun?",
  "28550": "Diana?",
  "28551": "But who was she?",
  "28552": "Have you been in others?",
  "28553": "How died he?",
  "28554": "She asked, if she should call me again?",
  "28555": "You won't mind, will you?",
  "28556": "Have you been there long?",
  "28557": "Do I interrupt?",
  "28558": "But it is quite understood, is it not?",
  "28559": "Will you carry him?",
  "28560": "Neither will he ever break faith where there have been oaths or agreements?",
  "28561": "If he comes back again, father?",
  "28562": "But who can tell what had happened?",
  "28563": "What then, I shall be asked, prevents these things from taking place with such regularity and precision?",
  "28564": "Who is the lady?",
  "28565": "Ain't it good enough to be in your book?",
  "28566": "And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?",
  "28567": "Is it not a just retribution?",
  "28568": "And where are the bodies?",
  "28569": "What do you say to coffee?",
  "28570": "Then we are friends?",
  "28571": "What are you thinking of, D'Artagnan?",
  "28572": "It was four years ago that I had it made, and what do you think I chose for the word and figures?",
  "28573": "Can I have missed it?",
  "28574": "Krajiek could 'a' put it there, couldn't he?",
  "28575": "WHICH candle?",
  "28576": "Shall we take their horses out, or tell them to find friends elsewhere as they best can?",
  "28577": "How much longer will you stay here?",
  "28578": "Is yours a hooky or a nobbly?",
  "28579": "And if he were innocent of any wrong, why did he not do something to clear himself?",
  "28580": "And it is to you, you graceless varlet, I owe all this?",
  "28581": "I have spoken of this because I keep wanting to know for a fact whether other people feel such enjoyment?",
  "28582": "Who is the fellow with him?",
  "28583": "And what will happen now?",
  "28584": "Can we be so unwise as to mean, that she shall keep a navy in our harbours for that purpose?",
  "28585": "Well, I don't think there's anything more, is there?",
  "28586": "Do you think that you are going to stay here?",
  "28587": "Are you going away, or has something happened?",
  "28588": "At the point where the path passes through the gate, you could surely pick up the tracks?",
  "28589": "What have we for lunch?",
  "28590": "Then it's a go, eh?",
  "28591": "What is't?",
  "28592": "Because she was there?",
  "28593": "Can you, of all the people who love her, bear to see her so?",
  "28594": "And if we had not arrived, what would you have done?",
  "28595": "Should you like me to take down his hat to him?",
  "28596": "Honest?",
  "28597": "Are all the flowers dead, or do some of them come again in the summer?",
  "28598": "Can one work there?",
  "28599": "Doing?",
  "28600": "I mean, will you be good to us, or do you intend to eat us?",
  "28601": "Will there be roses?",
  "28602": "Who gives you your maintenance, I pray you?",
  "28603": "What makes you pant so, my friend?",
  "28604": "Is it his fault that he is so ugly, and has so little sense?",
  "28605": "And what due or proper thing is given by cookery, and to what?",
  "28606": "Do you take me vor a shicken ?",
  "28607": "Wot good are you?",
  "28608": "What are you to do?",
  "28609": "And why do you ask that?",
  "28610": "What is it, grandmother?",
  "28611": "What's the good of stopping?",
  "28612": "Had I right, for my own benefit, to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations?",
  "28613": "Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?",
  "28614": "By whose means?",
  "28615": "How much do you own?",
  "28616": "And the lakes, cousin, what do you say of them?",
  "28617": "Why don't you go and fetch things?",
  "28618": "Is that possible?",
  "28619": "What do you mean by lagging and a lifer?",
  "28620": "Are there no honest ones?",
  "28621": "And what is THAT to me?",
  "28622": "Are you unwell today?",
  "28623": "Phips had compromised, and why not he?",
  "28624": "To the office?",
  "28625": "Why should he bear all this?",
  "28626": "Successfully, I hope?",
  "28627": "Have you not heard the astonishing intelligence regarding her surreptitious union?",
  "28628": "Yet, what have I got to do with it?",
  "28629": "Still he's not worth her little finger, is he?",
  "28630": "Is the baby all right?",
  "28631": "Has she been stolen?",
  "28632": "Why must she do it?",
  "28633": "And by what means our news to him repeat?",
  "28634": "What in the world was the meaning of this?",
  "28635": "Is it possible that this stranger has now become everything to me?",
  "28636": "Forgive me, won't you, and let me put the poor brute out of his misery?",
  "28637": "The question arises, what disposition are we to make of our accumulating funds?",
  "28638": "Is it of any use for me to tell you again why we must try to part with the house?",
  "28639": "How comes it that you would not answer my greetings for so long?",
  "28640": "And what did the firm say?",
  "28641": "You do think I could do some good at it, if I were to try?",
  "28642": "But what is to be done, old man?",
  "28643": "As they are or as they appear?",
  "28644": "I didn't do wrong, did I?",
  "28645": "What do I want with them?",
  "28646": "Where is that secretary person?",
  "28647": "What could he do, even supposing himself strong enough to fight the battle?",
  "28648": "Can one be too much alive, too happy?",
  "28649": "Who are to be the objects of popular choice?",
  "28650": "But will not the general be too hospitable for you?",
  "28651": "And that's the lad, sir, is it?",
  "28652": "Which road?",
  "28653": "And me?",
  "28654": "Oh, so it's not time to die yet?",
  "28655": "And how is it he has got this power over you, that you promise to marry him against your will?",
  "28656": "How could the devil from hell himself escape alive?",
  "28657": "Why don't you leave him alone?",
  "28658": "And why so late returned?",
  "28659": "What about leaving that bright boy of yours on guard?",
  "28660": "Did ye ever know this?",
  "28661": "Are you content, my beloved?",
  "28662": "Ye that tell us of harmony and reconciliation, can ye restore to us the time that is past?",
  "28663": "If they had said I was niece to a piping bullfinch, what would you care?",
  "28664": "Have you served under the usurper?",
  "28665": "You would want nothing for so doing?",
  "28666": "What's injudicious, hey?",
  "28667": "Who of you heard his evil song?",
  "28668": "On you?",
  "28669": "Why have you come?",
  "28670": "What have I ever known?",
  "28671": "How many times do I love again?",
  "28672": "Then I may reckon on it, your excellency?",
  "28673": "You have heard me?",
  "28674": "You're the son of one and the nephew of the other?",
  "28675": "And at what date?",
  "28676": "Is he to go up for examination?",
  "28677": "Old lady?",
  "28678": "Have you found it?",
  "28679": "Isn't there any help for it?",
  "28680": "Who speaks for this cub?",
  "28681": "Is it not very unwise in us to go on spending the little money we've got when I can keep down expenditures by an honest occupation?",
  "28682": "What ought they to be allowed, or not allowed, to do, be, and suffer?",
  "28683": "How long have you been there?",
  "28684": "Do you wish for a name?",
  "28685": "But what, miss?",
  "28686": "And you never by any chance lose sight of him, I presume?",
  "28687": "Should we go now?",
  "28688": "How is one to vanish partly?",
  "28689": "Who was it that was eaten?",
  "28690": "Can I have another piece?",
  "28691": "Where is the use of the devil in that sentence?",
  "28692": "Whereabouts?",
  "28693": "It is awful, love, isn't it?",
  "28694": "Yet how can I let this knavish dog die and lose the money?",
  "28695": "Or how bear the expense of such a journey?",
  "28696": "I am to drag my present life on, holding its pains at your pleasure, day by day?",
  "28697": "One and all?",
  "28698": "And will the inspection have to be made now?",
  "28699": "You do not understand?",
  "28700": "Always ready?",
  "28701": "Can you get a few men together to go there?",
  "28702": "Shall we allege a musical dispute?",
  "28703": "Is it riveted to the planks?",
  "28704": "What, then, possessed him?",
  "28705": "Have you got it?",
  "28706": "Do you believe you have still a certain amount of it to expend this evening?",
  "28707": "Won't anything make you understand that?",
  "28708": "Wouldn't you rather sit here?",
  "28709": "Then why in the world not?",
  "28710": "What are they then?",
  "28711": "What can you love me for?",
  "28712": "Is he a presentable sort of a person?",
  "28713": "Why do you talk like this to THEM?",
  "28714": "But what was his name?",
  "28715": "What do you mean by gone?",
  "28716": "But why don't you want to take it?",
  "28717": "Is not it what you have often wished to do yourself?",
  "28718": "Would a boat be waiting for us with supplies and letters?",
  "28719": "What must have been his feelings?",
  "28720": "And shall we ever come into our own again?",
  "28721": "What do you want, my pretty?",
  "28722": "Supposing him to be attached to me, would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?",
  "28723": "But suppose she had run against this piece of iron?",
  "28724": "Who will be the jury?",
  "28725": "You think, then, that you can help me more efficaciously than your brothers?",
  "28726": "And do you think it's true?",
  "28727": "Shall there never be a fresh opportunity of trying the ranges of projectiles?",
  "28728": "Did he wake up?",
  "28729": "Was he nice?",
  "28730": "And now what will we do?",
  "28731": "Do you not know?",
  "28732": "And if that were the case would your honor condemn his action?",
  "28733": "And during these days what shall I do?",
  "28734": "Don't the knives hurt?",
  "28735": "Where have you come from and what is your name?",
  "28736": "But how shall we get back?",
  "28737": "How many of the zechins, your father saved, are still left?",
  "28738": "What are your additions?",
  "28739": "What are the foundations of inequality?",
  "28740": "How did you get it?",
  "28741": "One of those swabs, was he?",
  "28742": "Do you believe he can?",
  "28743": "Who has seen her?",
  "28744": "What did he mean by such a pagan idea?",
  "28745": "Was it because at that time we passed for very rich people, and you were afraid of being refused?",
  "28746": "And besides, what have I done to bring it about?",
  "28747": "Alas, what shall I wretched wight become?",
  "28748": "But suppose it's a woman?",
  "28749": "Why am I to give an account of myself?",
  "28750": "What's that you tell me?",
  "28751": "But you think she wouldn't come?",
  "28752": "What colorable reason could be assigned, in a country so situated, for such vast augmentations of the military force?",
  "28753": "Is this too little?",
  "28754": "For the last three months?",
  "28755": "What could he reply to the deposition of the gendarmes who had arrested him in the very act?",
  "28756": "Where is thy answer, culprit?",
  "28757": "You are recovering again?",
  "28758": "What are you blurting out NOW?",
  "28759": "Shall we yield to force?",
  "28760": "Come, I do not ask for the sake of questioning you, but how did you get in?",
  "28761": "What do you wish, gentlemen?",
  "28762": "What does she?",
  "28763": "What, then, is the use of your worship?",
  "28764": "Was the gate open?",
  "28765": "Shall us begin it now?",
  "28766": "A recruit, sir, I understand?",
  "28767": "Sir?",
  "28768": "Yet could a woman who had done even what she had done deserve all this?",
  "28769": "But who would do it?",
  "28770": "Has not your father already his sixth wife?",
  "28771": "I ask, is it not as good a rule for him as it is for me?",
  "28772": "WHAT do you call him?",
  "28773": "Who is coward now?",
  "28774": "Have they nothing better to do?",
  "28775": "But that's remarkably altruistic of you, isn't it?",
  "28776": "Are you feeling any better?",
  "28777": "Do you think I care more for my dress than for my little girl?",
  "28778": "What man of taste and feeling can endure rifacimenti, harmonies, abridgments, expurgated editions?",
  "28779": "Faucheux?",
  "28780": "And do you think that you would be happy with her, or she with you, after what has passed?",
  "28781": "Do you ask their pardon of me?",
  "28782": "Who can possibly have told you I had had that dream?",
  "28783": "And this is the return you make me for all the indulgences I've heaped on you?",
  "28784": "Why not raise it five more?",
  "28785": "Will you let me tell you?",
  "28786": "You allow me?",
  "28787": "A week?",
  "28788": "And yet what else was she to think?",
  "28789": "Say, was my mother rightly slain or not?",
  "28790": "But where is this devotion?",
  "28791": "Where have I got one?",
  "28792": "Does not that content you?",
  "28793": "And what is the difference?",
  "28794": "Why are you merry?",
  "28795": "If you really cannot come to me will you let me come to you?",
  "28796": "What matters it of whom he spoke?",
  "28797": "What did it matter if the message were not intended for him?",
  "28798": "Was ever a respectable gentleman in such an impasse?",
  "28799": "Peas?",
  "28800": "You won't forget how fond you are of me?",
  "28801": "What's the matter now?",
  "28802": "Where is this great spider of yours now?",
  "28803": "What have you done now?",
  "28804": "Did you see nobody concealed while you were there?",
  "28805": "Besides what have we to do with setting the world at defiance?",
  "28806": "It looks as if you were trying to fleece me?",
  "28807": "But why suspect me before the action?",
  "28808": "And you live here?",
  "28809": "What mean you?",
  "28810": "That's good impartial evidence, ain't it?",
  "28811": "Do you think for one moment that this little haystack is enough to feed all the flocks in the whole district?",
  "28812": "What is there more astonishing in all that I have said to you than in what you have told me?",
  "28813": "You will not help me, then?",
  "28814": "Surely you have gone too far?",
  "28815": "But I don't exactly see how we can do that?",
  "28816": "Why should he do it?",
  "28817": "But don't you think she'll know all about it, just the same?",
  "28818": "What is the business you wish to see her about?",
  "28819": "Is there anything more?",
  "28820": "Would you deprive me of one of the most indispensable of my means of livelihood?",
  "28821": "Why, how is this?",
  "28822": "What have made you so down?",
  "28823": "And where may he be now?",
  "28824": "The last time that I see him?",
  "28825": "What is her secret?",
  "28826": "Isn't there some nice girl who'd read and amuse you?",
  "28827": "Have you made this trip before?",
  "28828": "Doesn't that satisfy you?",
  "28829": "I say, stranger, how are ye?",
  "28830": "Is not this so?",
  "28831": "How long were you there?",
  "28832": "Wherein?",
  "28833": "Where, may I ask?",
  "28834": "Who is in this world?",
  "28835": "Doesn't join in with the lads in their games, to get some sort of excitement in this lonely place?",
  "28836": "Well, I wait patiently, do I not?",
  "28837": "Shall I have a cab called?",
  "28838": "And then your negotiations will fail?",
  "28839": "It looks newer than the other things?",
  "28840": "She what?",
  "28841": "Should you like me to stay away?",
  "28842": "What had I to do with him that he should rob me of my sleep?",
  "28843": "Will master come here a moment?",
  "28844": "Can there be an appearance of that which has no form?",
  "28845": "Shall we not?",
  "28846": "Where are you going, you rogue?",
  "28847": "And you are very happy?",
  "28848": "You won't have anything?",
  "28849": "Whither shall I bear my shame?",

  "29252": "Will you?",
  "29253": "Well, aren't we going to get married?",
  "29254": "Then where does the vanity come in?",
  "29255": "But what were you to do with that woman?",
  "29256": "What does that signify, so long as they favor your suit?",
  "29257": "Do you want to stay here all day?",
  "29258": "Have you a pen?",
  "29259": "What's to become of me?",
  "29260": "What is a power, but the ability or faculty of doing a thing?",
  "29261": "Is it?",
  "29262": "Now, was there ever, since men emerged from a state of utter barbarism, an age in which there were no debts?",
  "29263": "There are whalers in these quarters, then?",
  "29264": "You went out with them, of course?",
  "29265": "Do they measure the king, too?",
  "29266": "And twisted it into thread?",
  "29267": "Where was he sitting?",
  "29268": "A setback?",
  "29269": "You will call me sister, will you not?",
  "29270": "Had she heard aright?",
  "29271": "Did we reach any goals?",
  "29272": "Whither was it going?",
  "29273": "And, suppose I should wish to be married to the man that I love?",
  "29274": "Did these men arrive here voluntarily or involuntarily, by disembarking on the shore or by being wrecked?",
  "29275": "Are you going too?",
  "29276": "Did you think there was nothing but evil at the bottom of them?",
  "29277": "What would she do?",
  "29278": "This vexes you?",
  "29279": "And what do I see here, monsieur?",
  "29280": "Why should she disappoint those expectations because of the imperious demands of a very highly excited boy?",
  "29281": "Good heavens, why should I?",
  "29282": "For an augury of good or evil?",
  "29283": "What is he doing?",
  "29284": "Why on earth should you doubt them?",
  "29285": "And are we convinced that all of them are generated out of opposites?",
  "29286": "He's got a pretty strong string round your father's leg, by what I hear, eh?",
  "29287": "Please, where ARE the crabs?",
  "29288": "If we had had provisions enough for months, how could we get out of the abyss into which we were being hurled by an irresistible torrent?",
  "29289": "May I ask how old he is, ma'am?",
  "29290": "Did you ever see her?",
  "29291": "But what on earth did she mean?",
  "29292": "What besides?",
  "29293": "And why do you stand there gaping?",
  "29294": "It wouldn't show on my eyes tomorrow, would it?",
  "29295": "Contempt, my friend?",
  "29296": "What's the right way to knock?",
  "29297": "Every mornin' do?",
  "29298": "And in what did that which has taken place concern you?",
  "29299": "What could that mean?",
  "29300": "You are her father?",
  "29301": "Are your wife and children destitute of a bed to lie on, or bread to live on?",
  "29302": "What will he do?",
  "29303": "Why disgrace me before the army?",
  "29304": "You came seeking me to make to me certain proposals, but did you make them?",
  "29305": "And why were you crying so just now?",
  "29306": "Then you can't protest the cheque?",
  "29307": "And will you get him first thing in the morning?",
  "29308": "What will you do with the light?",
  "29309": "Have you come up determined not to deal?",
  "29310": "You have heard and understood what your granddaughter has been saying, sir, have you?",
  "29311": "What could they desire beyond their liberty?",
  "29312": "Edlin?",
  "29313": "What shall we do with him?",
  "29314": "Is not thy common talk found aphorisms?",
  "29315": "I should like to deal him a blow, but can I actually do it?",
  "29316": "Do you know what time your father will be back?",
  "29317": "But who, then, is this assassin, this murderer?",
  "29318": "Why did he urge me so little about the princess?",
  "29319": "What is the meaning of their eternal care and worry?",
  "29320": "Were his eyes deceiving him?",
  "29321": "Why this ridiculous mania for affirming that every thing has been said, which means that we know all about mental and moral science?",
  "29322": "And you spoke to him?",
  "29323": "What's the trouble?",
  "29324": "Give who?",
  "29325": "Anything else?",
  "29326": "Are you mad enough to leave this house?",
  "29327": "How long have you been engaged in the practice of medicine?",
  "29328": "What of it?",
  "29329": "Then it will be our duty to select, if we can, natures which are fitted for the task of guarding the city?",
  "29330": "Why not end my misery now rather than drag out a few more wretched days in this dark pit?",
  "29331": "Why did you lend an ear to the temptings of friends?",
  "29332": "What do you understand of the affair?",
  "29333": "Are we to pass the night in the king's room?",
  "29334": "Not about money, I hope?",
  "29335": "Extraordinary, did you say?",
  "29336": "Why should you interfere?",
  "29337": "She doesn't know yet?",
  "29338": "Gania, what are you standing there for?",
  "29339": "But why, of all others, choose these?",
  "29340": "Ever so little did you say, gossip?",
  "29341": "Are you in need of soothsaying?",
  "29342": "An incendiary, then?",
  "29343": "To come at call?",
  "29344": "Have I time?",
  "29345": "Do they live?",
  "29346": "And this is all?",
  "29347": "You mean that you want to go away from me?",
  "29348": "Now, my friends, can the country be saved upon that basis?",
  "29349": "What, billing so sweetly?",
  "29350": "Well, then what of it?",
  "29351": "What would my islanders say when they heard their governor was going, strolling about on the winds?",
  "29352": "And in that case there's no reason on earth why you shouldn't go back?",
  "29353": "But, guardian, may we not hope that a little experience will teach him what a false and wretched thing it is?",
  "29354": "Have you told them to bring the horse?",
  "29355": "What are we doing?",
  "29356": "Well, did you see them fly?",
  "29357": "What are you up to?",
  "29358": "And that's why you trust him, eh?",
  "29359": "And what does he think of it?",
  "29360": "What sort of an education could they have got in the country?",
  "29361": "How do you go back?",
  "29362": "How old is your sister?",
  "29363": "Who are you, sir, and by what right do you touch this gentleman's papers?",
  "29364": "Were they in the tent?",
  "29365": "Some poaching case, no doubt?",
  "29366": "What is that for?",
  "29367": "On what occasion?",
  "29368": "But were there no reasons why I should avoid you?",
  "29369": "Would it not be of some assistance, if we knew of what substance it is composed?",
  "29370": "Mustn't it be splendid to be remarkable and have compositions written about you after you're dead?",
  "29371": "Had she only been guilty of silence as to his fate?",
  "29372": "Shall I take it down for you?",
  "29373": "What about, papa?",
  "29374": "But I suppose there is no fire?",
  "29375": "Why should she talk of her own unhappiness?",
  "29376": "The whole picture ruined, isn't it so?",
  "29377": "Surely you won't have to make another for me?",
  "29378": "Where do you suppose him to be?",
  "29379": "And what means are ours, of attaining the truth?",
  "29380": "You mean?",
  "29381": "Please, sir, be this note for you?",
  "29382": "Surely I can never have seriously written such a silly motto as that?",
  "29383": "Have you made up your mind when you shall be there yourself?",
  "29384": "Need it go on?",
  "29385": "What was going on in that mind which was so young and yet already so impenetrable?",
  "29386": "Couldn't he have some spark of manhood about him?",
  "29387": "What shall become of this?",
  "29388": "But how was this to be done, when he had no revenue, often not means enough for necessary expenses?",
  "29389": "What steps have you taken?",
  "29390": "But what's the name of your chief?",
  "29391": "And now?",
  "29392": "What was that they said?",
  "29393": "Why should any one murder a man in so clumsy a fashion as by hanging him?",
  "29394": "Stands the wind in that quarter?",
  "29395": "Is it really true, what every one says, that you cut off one of the ogre's arms?",
  "29396": "Should he knock as of old?",
  "29397": "Nothing about the silver calabash he spat into?",
  "29398": "But what availeth it?",
  "29399": "Where then lay the spots of commonness?",
  "29400": "That seems strange to you, doesn't it?",
  "29401": "Who will volunteer for the job?",
  "29402": "How do we stand in point of time, constable, eh?",
  "29403": "Did I not promise?",
  "29404": "Well, who said it was?",
  "29405": "I suppose your people all do this?",
  "29406": "Did anyone send you, sir?",
  "29407": "What then do you know?",
  "29408": "But where could a dog have come from?",
  "29409": "What shall I do with this beastly tumbril?",
  "29410": "Do I excuse her for it?",
  "29411": "Who is it that compels them to borne along?",
  "29412": "Did any of you gentlemen want to have it out with ME?",
  "29413": "Am I not a madman, and therefore irresponsible?",
  "29414": "How am I afraid of myself?",
  "29415": "Where am I?",
  "29416": "Did he before?",
  "29417": "Do you want her?",
  "29418": "To what, then, do we owe these blessings?",
  "29419": "Runic?",
  "29420": "I say, shall we soon be clear?",
  "29421": "Slid, sir, what should you behold in my face, sir, that should move you, as they say, sir, to ask me, sir, if I would sell my rapier?",
  "29422": "Am I worth anything now, since you have got into such high favor?",
  "29423": "Will nothing make you understand?",
  "29424": "And are thy deeds so good?",
  "29425": "This young cavalier, who won't have me?",
  "29426": "Tell me would you rob?",
  "29427": "Ah, it's you?",
  "29428": "What more can the devil do than strangle us?",
  "29429": "Anything more?",
  "29430": "What does it matter, when you come to think of it, whether a child is yours by blood or not?",
  "29431": "I passed you on the road?",
  "29432": "And what makes you think?",
  "29433": "Is he come back, then?",
  "29434": "Is their race extinct?",
  "29435": "Why do you cast those anxious looks on each other?",
  "29436": "Finished what, may I ask?",
  "29437": "Why, they say, is he not perfect in his training?",
  "29438": "Just now, don't you find something uncomfortable, disquieting, alarming in the atmosphere of this room?",
  "29439": "Njal went on to ask, whether he had a right of action against all of them, or whether the leaders had to answer for them all in the suit?",
  "29440": "Will you swear it?",
  "29441": "Does your excellency wish for a receipt?",
  "29442": "What experiment?",
  "29443": "How can varieties of soil engender a principle of legislation and politics?",
  "29444": "What do I know about business?",
  "29445": "But what must they deserve, then, who set him to work?",
  "29446": "But why?",
  "29447": "What would you like best to do?",
  "29448": "Meditatin', eh?",
  "29449": "Next time you roust me out, you hear?",
  "29450": "But it's not serious?",
  "29451": "We knew you were going to get married, did we?",
  "29452": "Why make a long story of what took but five minutes to do?",
  "29453": "Why with disgust?",
  "29454": "What mill?",
  "29455": "What evil spirit has taken possession of your heart that you should be so wicked?",
  "29456": "Whether a profound genius, or a sure judgment?",
  "29457": "Why should you love me?",
  "29458": "Will not the landholder know and feel whatever will promote or insure the interest of landed property?",
  "29459": "Have you heard of her good fortune?",
  "29460": "These bodies serve us?",
  "29461": "Hippolyte?",
  "29462": "Tell me, do you love me?",
  "29463": "Are you angry with me?",
  "29464": "And if they were glad to have you, why should I have brought you away?",
  "29465": "Chopin's style, then, was not original?",
  "29466": "Do you desire me to go?",
  "29467": "What d'ye think the old fornicator saith?",
  "29468": "But when he comes to his box?",
  "29469": "Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?",
  "29470": "And who told you to defend the king?",
  "29471": "No great lord to shield you with his name?",
  "29472": "Granting that the earth might be removed from the centre of the globe, what would happen to the water?",
  "29473": "And you, my friend?",

  "29476": "Tell us what you require?",
  "29477": "What papers?",
  "29478": "Wot do you look at a man so for?",
  "29479": "And for what purpose?",
  "29480": "I now calm?",
  "29481": "What do you want to do?",
  "29482": "Agents?",
  "29483": "And woven the thread into cloth?",
  "29484": "Have you undertaken the task to enrich me in this world?",
  "29485": "Did their zeal flag or their courage fail?",
  "29486": "Why should he have said that I was a nuisance to the whole country?",
  "29487": "How, then, shall we explain this change?",
  "29488": "Even if I were to scrape off the gold?",
  "29489": "Computation, if two to one against two, how many against five?",
  "29490": "How could that be, monsieur?",

  "29492": "The what?",
  "29493": "Do you deny that this property is legitimate?",
  "29494": "Osbaldistone?",
  "29495": "And did you not hear me swear promise to her, that so she closed her eyes grateful?",
  "29496": "What is the power of laying and collecting taxes, but a LEGISLATIVE POWER, or a power of MAKING LAWS, to lay and collect taxes?",
  "29497": "Do you really love me?",

  "29511": "And could she see him?",
  "29512": "Is that your church, sir?",
  "29513": "Does he think I haven't got any eyes?",
  "29514": "Did they exert themselves to help onward the great movement of the human race, or to stop it?",
  "29515": "And what is their cause?",
  "29516": "But what did we do?",
  "29517": "Two shortest months?",
  "29518": "Knew what, my dear?",
  "29519": "What good is there in waiting?",

  "29536": "She went back to that place?",
  "29537": "Have you sufficiently observed the wonders it covers, its fishes, its zoophytes, its parterres of sponges, and its forests of coral?",
  "29538": "Why do you run so, mamma?",
  "29539": "Who wants your love, man?",
  "29540": "Rather out of condition still, hey?",
  "29541": "Was it outside, in the air?",
  "29542": "What would he think?",
  "29543": "That charming young woman with her is her daughter?",
  "29544": "Found your way up here?",
  "29545": "You can read?",
  "29546": "How can you let her?",

  "29553": "But why have two of each sort?",
  "29554": "Does he not call the other pleasures necessary, under the idea that if there were no necessity for them, he would rather not have them?",
  "29555": "You'd like her for your honeymoon?",
  "29556": "For what are you, my young friend?",
  "29557": "Then you don't think I'll see him again?",
  "29558": "And yet you come here, and tell me such a dreadful lie as you did just now, eh?",
  "29559": "Well, sir, what of this?",
  "29560": "Will you?",
  "29561": "Do you hear me, some of you?",
  "29562": "If I flee from her, there's a law to punish me?",
  "29563": "Can you not guess?",
  "29564": "Who knows what will come in sight round the bend of the valley there?",
  "29565": "What's the last joke?",
  "29566": "How then do service which offends his shade?",
  "29567": "Then you were not engaged to marry him?",
  "29568": "Did not you ask it for anything?",
  "29569": "Can I speak with him?",
  "29570": "And to feel not exactly dull, but sad?",
  "29571": "Was it near, was it far?",
  "29572": "Wouldn't you, ferryman, like to accept these clothes, which are a nuisance to me, from me?",
  "29573": "Isn't he?",
  "29574": "Neither, I said, can there be any question that the guardian who is to keep anything should have eyes rather than no eyes?",
  "29575": "Damn it, did you then take me along with you for your chaplain, to sing mass and shrive you?",
  "29576": "Your mother won't know, and so what's the harm?",
  "29577": "What is the liberty of the press?",
  "29578": "Would she throw away the inestimable advantage of royal protection?",
  "29579": "In whom can we trust?",
  "29580": "Then how is it that you did not go?",
  "29581": "And what reward have they?",
  "29582": "Shan't we try that?",
  "29583": "Would you care to try it?",
  "29584": "See what, sir?",
  "29585": "What else could I say when he asked me?",
  "29586": "Are you willing to carry us through the air wherever we wish to go?",
  "29587": "Suppose it was all a gigantic mistake?",
  "29588": "Why out of the question?",
  "29589": "Is your secret of enough importance to me to spare your life for it?",
  "29590": "Oh?",
  "29591": "What more can I desire?",
  "29592": "What would he say then?",
  "29593": "Where are these lamps?",
  "29594": "Who, mother?",
  "29595": "You are studying topography?",
  "29596": "What rent do you pay here?",
  "29597": "Now, do you want any more?",
  "29598": "Is there anything wrong?",
  "29599": "How could that be possible?",
  "29600": "Hadn't I better have a shave?",
  "29601": "How could angels bear the sight?",
  "29602": "You think it then possible that they really won't have returned?",
  "29603": "What's the answer?",
  "29604": "What do you mean by the proposal you made just now?",
  "29605": "I surmise you also are quits?",
  "29606": "What sort of wood is't?",
  "29607": "Can't any one make him stop?",
  "29608": "Do you consider me so?",
  "29609": "How do I know what I was before?",
  "29610": "Shall I see you again ere my departure?",
  "29611": "Am I alarmed?",
  "29612": "How long a start have they?",
  "29613": "In the second, whence comes it?",
  "29614": "What, monsieur?",
  "29615": "Didn't ye hear a word about them matters and something more, eh?",
  "29616": "Till at last he be?",
  "29617": "And what was there in a simple curl of fair hair to appall that brutal man, familiar with every form of cruelty?",
  "29618": "In love with HER?",
  "29619": "But we would agree to make him rich enough to live, I suppose?",
  "29620": "Would a tablespoon of vanilla be enough for a small layer cake?",
  "29621": "But why do I say, in this case?",
  "29622": "He will be superintendent?",
  "29623": "Your sentence of death, if any soul hears you?",
  "29624": "What embarrassment?",
  "29625": "How do you do, dear friend?",
  "29626": "Have you got the key, auntie?",
  "29627": "What's a captive?",
  "29628": "Can that, with any sort of justice, be styled a blunder?",
  "29629": "But may I not write a note to tell him why I cannot come?",
  "29630": "Meanin' aour packets?",
  "29631": "Why did he do it?",
  "29632": "Has his housekeeper gone too?",
  "29633": "What do you like?",
  "29634": "You have observed that?",
  "29635": "She and I were like sisters, and now she is gone, will you not let me be like a sister to you in your trouble?",
  "29636": "And is there any opposite to life?",
  "29637": "Well?",
  "29638": "Don't you think that people are most conceited of all about their sensual powers?",
  "29639": "What am I to do if I love nothing but fame and men's esteem?",
  "29640": "What do you see there?",
  "29641": "How should a man tell you who knows everything?",
  "29642": "Of what did he die?",
  "29643": "The convicts?",
  "29644": "Don't you know that their attorneys have noticed us that they have withdrawn the suit?",
  "29645": "Who was ever successful in true love?",
  "29646": "Don't you see that by the very fact of your choosing her you prove that you do not know what is best for you?",
  "29647": "Does he?",
  "29648": "Can't you take my word?",
  "29649": "Why should we not get him?",
  "29650": "Ladislaw?",
  "29651": "Does he accept?",
  "29652": "Could it be possible that she should her have to encounter another amorous swain?",
  "29653": "If I catch him there again, shall I have the right to thrash him and her also?",
  "29654": "Is not this the time for us to go back?",
  "29655": "Very reserved, isn't he?",
  "29656": "Ha, what?",
  "29657": "If so, whose?",
  "29658": "And what do you want to do now?",
  "29659": "And the windows too?",
  "29660": "But do you know, gentlemen, what was the chief point about my spite?",
  "29661": "Is there anything the matter, father?",
  "29662": "How do you cure the shivers?",
  "29663": "You have lost one of your boots?",
  "29664": "How comes it that he is unknown?",
  "29665": "What sort of a man is that?",
  "29666": "You have been into the church?",
  "29667": "Is it so beautiful as all that?",
  "29668": "Well, what are you doing there, then?",
  "29669": "Are you used to burglary, may I ask?",
  "29670": "Can't I come back to your rooms?",
  "29671": "And you are NOT, I presume, eh?",
  "29672": "I wonder why?",
  "29673": "Would he come and see her in spite of his mother?",
  "29674": "Wouldn't you rather come in here, to me?",
  "29675": "And what did they see?",
  "29676": "What sort of lives do the majority of folk lead?",
  "29677": "What in the act of offering?",
  "29678": "What could I say, what could I do?",
  "29679": "Know you which, of all his wives, possessed these in the highest degree?",
  "29680": "If they do this, how are we to know when they mean what they say, and of what value can their evidence on points of culture be reckoned?",
  "29681": "Then the soul is immortal?",
  "29682": "Yes, yes, it's your sting, and you are a wasp, that's what you are, a wasp, do you hear?",
  "29683": "Can a man be too cruel to his mother's enemy?",
  "29684": "What child can that be?",
  "29685": "We are to meet as usual?",
  "29686": "Why can I not, on the contrary, say ill enough of her to prevent your going to her?",
  "29687": "But there's good art in me?",
  "29688": "Where is the commander in chief?",
  "29689": "And how do you like it?",
  "29690": "And higher still?",
  "29691": "What does that matter to me?",
  "29692": "Shall I tell you how it will be?",
  "29693": "And who are the really clever men, after all?",
  "29694": "For what other reason can you have laid your plans to talk in this way to such a woman as I am?",
  "29695": "It may come to that, that we must leave this place, but till that time comes, why should your young days be clouded?",
  "29696": "You won't do it again, eh?",
  "29697": "Why then does their rump look toward heaven?",
  "29698": "Has he not all the tricks of a demon at his command?",
  "29699": "What intonation of voice?",
  "29700": "You are coming to sup with me, are you not?",
  "29701": "Making ready for a move?",
  "29702": "But you guess it now, do you not?",
  "29703": "What was it he saw that made his heart stand still?",
  "29704": "Wasn't it all for your good, viper?",
  "29705": "Alas, what would become of me who can only atone for evil by doing good?",
  "29706": "Is the case so desperate?",
  "29707": "What did he do that for?",
  "29708": "If it was indeed that she had in her own person a dual existence, what might happen when the two existences became one?",
  "29709": "If there be no water of unchanging fluidity, how can there be the unreal and temporary forms of waves?",
  "29710": "You are here already, are you, my gentleman?",
  "29711": "Who are you, dear?",
  "29712": "Waste?",
  "29713": "Then what would you like to do until your uncle comes back?",
  "29714": "If you can't see it yourself, why try to debar me?",
  "29715": "Bless the girl, what are you shivering about?",
  "29716": "Said he, and stamped with his foot, am I to be questioned thus by such a one as you?",
  "29717": "Then where is he?",
  "29718": "Were you obliged to have medical attendance?",
  "29719": "Has any horse got loose?",
  "29720": "And after him have you had no love?",
  "29721": "Where have you had your information?",
  "29722": "What is your meaning?",
  "29723": "With YOU?",
  "29724": "Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?",
  "29725": "What is a man the worse for dying?",
  "29726": "What constitutional maxim is there which applies to the former and not to the latter?",
  "29727": "Shall I arrange?",
  "29728": "Deer?",
  "29729": "Orders?",
  "29730": "He may have reported to you what he pleased, but could not I do the same by him?",
  "29731": "Why doesn't he get something to do?",
  "29732": "Why couldn't he have made up his mind last night?",
  "29733": "Who doubts that?",
  "29734": "Why, to accuse the man, do you address the woman?",
  "29735": "Have I any time to spare?",
  "29736": "Well, what does she want now?",
  "29737": "Haven't you got anything worse than this?",
  "29738": "But do you know why I am saying all this?",
  "29739": "Do you not come in the king's name?",
  "29740": "Shall we dress it here, as usual?",
  "29741": "Why should I fright ye?",
  "29742": "Between whom?",
  "29743": "Will you be my ally, my lady?",
  "29744": "Now then, where's your chief's quarters?",
  "29745": "Is that an aphorism or a cliche?",
  "29746": "What meaneth this restless wagging of her slouchy chaps?",
  "29747": "It gives a lonely man a sort of hankering, doesn't it?",
  "29748": "Ain't you afraid of it, sir?",
  "29749": "And anything else?",
  "29750": "You really won't meet the rest of them?",
  "29751": "How do I know it?",
  "29752": "But what's to be done?",
  "29753": "What is a trousseau?",
  "29754": "Where's the burnisher?",
  "29755": "The ruler may impose the laws and institutions which we have been describing, and the citizens may possibly be willing to obey them?",
  "29756": "You did not send to me?",
  "29757": "Monsieur, can you expose me to the cruel trial of never seeing you again?",
  "29758": "The kind that wear skins?",
  "29759": "Who shall say what he did think?",
  "29760": "Yet is it tangible and real wealth?",
  "29761": "Of work as well?",
  "29762": "Would it not be better if the end did come, the very end?",
  "29763": "No, never?",
  "29764": "Has the whelp been playing that game long?",
  "29765": "Is there no mission in thy native land, O planeticose and exallotriote spirit?",
  "29766": "And what has he said to that?",
  "29767": "And your friend still longs to be made a baron?",
  "29768": "Would you tell me, please?",
  "29769": "Did you put any thing particular in it?",
  "29770": "But would the end really be his own convenience?",
  "29771": "I suppose I'd better not come back with him?",
  "29772": "Does a flower appeal to him?",
  "29773": "Yes, she's as good as they make 'em, and she's all the female I possess and spoiled in consequence, aren't you, old girl?",
  "29774": "What do you know?",
  "29775": "What then could I against the will of heaven?",
  "29776": "Will you allow me to whisper half a syllable, sir?",
  "29777": "Whence arises this fault?",
  "29778": "Would you like a cup of tea?",
  "29779": "In this state of the case, my friends, why is the country agitated?",
  "29780": "You are rich, then, I suppose?",
  "29781": "But how about the tennis?",
  "29782": "Did he mean that literally?",
  "29783": "Hadn't you better say two fifty?",
  "29784": "If the infected were removed, why not mention it?",
  "29785": "Which is it to be?",
  "29786": "Then he will no more have true opinion than he will have knowledge about the goodness or badness of his imitations?",
  "29787": "You have seen him?",
  "29788": "What men are safe if this is done?",
  "29789": "Does she think so?",
  "29790": "Why don't you ask him?",
  "29791": "Does it hurt to be invis'ble?",
  "29792": "You don't think I do it because I like it, do you?",
  "29793": "Is that correct?",
  "29794": "Girl number twenty, isn't this a prosperous nation, and a'n't you in a thriving state?",
  "29795": "Had you, then, that sum?",
  "29796": "Our lease expires when?",
  "29797": "Who are you who speaks out of the darkness?",
  "29798": "Are they to have the fame of such as they go through, and we the labour?",
  "29799": "Should you also like to be maid of honor?",
  "29800": "What discovery?",
  "29801": "What shall we do with our sleds?",
  "29802": "What big house is that just ahead, please?",
  "29803": "What will you do with yourself for the time?",
  "29804": "You have kissed the queen's hand?",
  "29805": "But when will that come to pass?",
  "29806": "Will you promise?",
  "29807": "Why do you give me this shame?",
  "29808": "Its name?",
  "29809": "I say, why have you been so rotten since I came back?",
  "29810": "On what subject shall I converse with her?",
  "29811": "Have you taken any precautions?",
  "29812": "You have unmasked this false prince also?",
  "29813": "Were you walking in your sleep?",
  "29814": "Won't you love me?",
  "29815": "Are you aware, sir, that we have gone to enormous expense to resist this iniquitous attempt of yours?",
  "29816": "Will you hold the horse while I stick them on?",
  "29817": "Well, then, I must go?",
  "29818": "Is it the solitary cell you want?",
  "29819": "An't you cold?",
  "29820": "Have you anything to say?",
  "29821": "You were not surprised, I dare say?",
  "29822": "How can I help laws?",
  "29823": "You could not tell vs if his sonne were there?",
  "29824": "Do you mean to say you don't hear anything?",
  "29825": "Who is his master?",
  "29826": "No garters?",
  "29827": "What is it that you think I shall do?",
  "29828": "What, you here too, prince?",
  "29829": "What in the world was this hall used for?",
  "29830": "Who would believe him?",
  "29831": "Offended me, boy?",
  "29832": "You know how to support losses?",
  "29833": "What were they doing now?",
  "29834": "I guess you'll mind your parts o' speech, and study the ACCIDENCE agin afore you let your clapper run arter that fashion, won't you?",
  "29835": "Then we should be able to ascertain if the BRITANNIA had left any traces of her shipwreck there?",
  "29836": "What are you going to flog that man for, sir?",
  "29837": "What is he going to do?",
  "29838": "Now what was the colonel to do?",
  "29839": "May I ask what is the cause of this unseemly noise?",
  "29840": "If it should break forth into a storm, who can insure us that in its progress a part of its fury would not be spent upon us?",
  "29841": "I'm going to be good, but can't you be good running round just as well as sitting still?",
  "29842": "How can we prevent that?",
  "29843": "Can't we go overside a piece?",
  "29844": "Might I come some other day?",
  "29845": "Go for a soldier, do you mean?",
  "29846": "But what did the mere reckoning of years matter when he felt as young in heart as he had been twenty years ago?",
  "29847": "How could a garden be shut up?",
  "29848": "Your wife or your daughter?",
  "29849": "So that you could see he knew what was between the two wretches?",
  "29850": "But who is there in the world that can boast of having fathomed or understood the wavering mind and unstable nature of a woman?",
  "29851": "Did you ever behold streets so insufferably narrow, or houses so miraculously tall?",
  "29852": "How can they know?",
  "29853": "Is it to make me a captain?",
  "29854": "What IS the matter with it?",
  "29855": "Would that surprise you?",
  "29856": "But would he come?",
  "29857": "How do you know I was praying, sir?",
  "29858": "Who looks after the sick here?",
  "29859": "Can'tyou walk yet?",
  "29860": "Who can make him out?",
  "29861": "To whom do I address it?",
  "29862": "But where was mine?",
  "29863": "Am I, indeed, so happy?",
  "29864": "Hemlock, do you mean?",
  "29865": "How could you possibly know that?",
  "29866": "Why so insensible to my uncle's interests?",
  "29867": "And the possibility has been acknowledged?",
  "29868": "Your ruin?",
  "29869": "Do you mean in point of reward?",
  "29870": "But how long have you been here that you are ignorant of all this?",
  "29871": "Haven't you put a drop of poison in that remark now, eh?",
  "29872": "Would there ever come to him a time of freedom?",
  "29873": "Will you bear, therefore, will you bear to see your sanctuary trampled on?",
  "29874": "Even if the squire should afterwards hear of his having been there, what would it matter?",
  "29875": "She said I was prudent and virtuous?",
  "29876": "How are you to get away from here?",
  "29877": "You are confident that the thief came in a cab?",
  "29878": "That's what it always comes to, doesn't it?",
  "29879": "What could he want?",
  "29880": "That was something in this way, warn't it?",
  "29881": "Why not have kept hold of it with both hands, with both knees, when it was about to flee from her?",
  "29882": "But to what does all this lead?",
  "29883": "Hasn't she always you?",
  "29884": "How do the bass chords run?",
  "29885": "Shall I send the servant to direct you?",
  "29886": "How much is the whole?",
  "29887": "And who instructed you, eh?",
  "29888": "Do you know anything of his history?",
  "29889": "Was she ever as pretty as my mother is now?",
  "29890": "But the puzzle is, who are the teachers?",
  "29891": "How could you be cruel to me?",
  "29892": "But well carried out, eh?",
  "29893": "How did you fare?",
  "29894": "Who does it come from?",
  "29895": "What happened within her?",
  "29896": "Whom had he to consult but himself now?",
  "29897": "What differences from terrestrial conditions will ensue?",
  "29898": "Isn't there a lot of hope in it?",
  "29899": "What stable?",
  "29900": "Do I look ugly?",
  "29901": "To relieve thy breast?",
  "29902": "Can you lift me into that tree and put a rifle in my hands?",
  "29903": "Shall I tell you what you were thinking to yourself just then?",
  "29904": "But what can I have to relate to you?",
  "29905": "Why is that woman always out of the way when she is most wanted?",
  "29906": "I hope you don't mind?",
  "29907": "What right had they to make me suffer like that?",
  "29908": "How long do you suppose this sea to be?",
  "29909": "Do you desire it as ardently as you say?",
  "29910": "If nature suddenly should give that beast a tail, would he not be prouder of it than all the other foxes in the wood?",
  "29911": "Watch and listen, won't you, so that you can give me your impression after the first act?",
  "29912": "Who could have said so the evening before?",
  "29913": "Very good?",
  "29914": "Are you likely to be more humane to me than others were yesterday?",
  "29915": "Was it my imagination that there was an undertone of fear rather than of hope in the question?",
  "29916": "What could have caused it?",
  "29917": "Is he a scholar, or a soldier?",
  "29918": "And to confer upon me the favour of your distinguished recommendation?",
  "29919": "How can he keep him?",
  "29920": "Surely you have felt that it is so?",
  "29921": "Could there be a development of knowledge in the absence of curiosity?",
  "29922": "Do the old fellows bother you?",
  "29923": "If what?",
  "29924": "And how have you been getting on?",
  "29925": "But you, sir?",
  "29926": "Did you see?",
  "29927": "Who is your favorite author?",
  "29928": "You think this old monkey in here knows what you say?",
  "29929": "What would you gain by it?",
  "29930": "You've been picking the flowers, hey?",
  "29931": "But are you so sure, so very sure of her?",
  "29932": "If I get your grandpa to apologize for the shaking, will you give up running away?",
  "29933": "Who's here?",
  "29934": "Don't you think that this has lasted long enough?",
  "29935": "Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring?",
  "29936": "And it is asked by what authority this bold and radical innovation was undertaken?",
  "29937": "I asked him upon this if he ever disputed with his wife?",
  "29938": "Sirrah, who gave you a commission to lie in my lordship?",
  "29939": "How can I tell?",
  "29940": "How could I let him?",
  "29941": "What hand and brain went ever pair'd?",
  "29942": "Why did you write me such a horrid letter, you naughty boy?",
  "29943": "Or can I ever see one?",
  "29944": "Quite?",
  "29945": "What is she vexed with him about?",
  "29946": "To do that, my joy?",
  "29947": "And later?",
  "29948": "But what language is it?",
  "29949": "Wouldn't YOU?",
  "29950": "Lucy dear, do you know why I tell you all this?",
  "29951": "How did they come to love each other?",
  "29952": "But what are you going to do to repay us for the past?",
  "29953": "Got any views on the subject?",
  "29954": "Of the duke?",
  "29955": "What means all this?",
  "29956": "Will you stay here if the enemy occupies the place?",
  "29957": "For how shall I be able, said he, to rule over others, that have not full power and command of myself?",
  "29958": "Go?",
  "29959": "Have I deserved to be called an elderly person?",
  "29960": "Is it because we are calculated to walk?",
  "29961": "Why ask about the next but one?",
  "29962": "Can we have the butler in for a moment?",
  "29963": "Wasn't it good of him?",
  "29964": "What prodigies be these?",
  "29965": "Who suffers by his ill whims?",
  "29966": "Do you hear the news?",
  "29967": "Is there any one who understands human and political virtue?",
  "29968": "Won't you go with me?",
  "29969": "What did she see there?",
  "29970": "The postilion?",
  "29971": "What ancient nation, as the same author asks, can be named that was originally monogamous?",
  "29972": "What can I do to do myself justice upon her?",
  "29973": "Your letter is like you, and what could I say of it that would be higher praise than that?",
  "29974": "You would not be cruel to me?",
  "29975": "Is everything here purple?",
  "29976": "Do you think we did well in using the adder's fat?",
  "29977": "When to be made payable?",
  "29978": "Is she married, my dear?",
  "29979": "Anyone about?",
  "29980": "Oriental?",
  "29981": "Are we going to see the court?",
  "29982": "So why should he have made such a sacrifice?",
  "29983": "Hrut asked him what news?",
  "29984": "What accursed philosophy stands in your way?",
  "29985": "And have you been up there?",
  "29986": "But why do you give them me?",
  "29987": "What was his own inward definitive response to the unbribable interrogatory of fatality?",
  "29988": "Is not the land more faithful?",
  "29989": "I wonder if it is mine?",
  "29990": "If you demand WHY?",
  "29991": "Allow me to ask you, prince, since you cherish those intentions, how you consider that you will provide for my happiness?",
  "29992": "Who among them can do it so well?",
  "29993": "And upon what will the tax be levied?",
  "29994": "Can't you see that he humbugs you just as much as ever he pleases?",
  "29995": "What would the gain be to me if I were healed and you not?",
  "29996": "The moonlight than the fog of frost?",
  "29997": "Where is he hiding?",
  "29998": "Why did not you say so then?",
  "29999": "What do you mean, sir?",
  "30000": "Would you like me to help you tonight?",
  "30001": "Why how you talk?",
  "30002": "Was there any lady of the house?",
  "30003": "For from what impression coued this idea be derived?",
  "30004": "Where did you get that onion?",
  "30005": "And shall we arrive there?",
  "30006": "Don't you see that he doesn't want to be followed?",
  "30007": "Is it about my husband?",
  "30008": "Does anybody bring up other people's children?",
  "30009": "What's the use of our wasting another year?",
  "30010": "Stolen diamonds?",
  "30011": "Mary, what do you think is going to happen?",
  "30012": "Well, what have you to say to me?",
  "30013": "Have you a cabriolet that you can let me have?",
  "30014": "What is it to you what he signs?",
  "30015": "She didn't tell you so?",
  "30016": "And where did you run into her, my good girl?",
  "30017": "Have there not been governments which were blind leaders of the blind?",
  "30018": "Who's me?",
  "30019": "Gave him?",
  "30020": "You are an extraordinary woman, why should you follow the ordinary course, the ordinary life?",
  "30021": "What may I hope for?",
  "30022": "But why are these two lords such enemies?",
  "30023": "How many women in these days would think of doing that?",
  "30024": "How is your hand?",
  "30025": "What ails you?",
  "30026": "Is it not strange that people can laugh, amuse themselves, be joyful under that eternal certainty of death?",
  "30027": "Yours or mine?",
  "30028": "Well, daughter, say, what is thy suit with us?",
  "30029": "What was the reason of this disappointment?",
  "30030": "Where am I?",
  "30031": "Where did they both come from?",
  "30032": "I, where?",
  "30033": "What sort of knowledge is there which would draw the soul from becoming to being?",
  "30034": "Burn the poor devils who are only condemned to be hung?",
  "30035": "What ought we to do?",

  "30465": "But is she not better as she is?",
  "30466": "The question was, had it been taken from him, or had he himself passed it on into another's keeping?",
  "30467": "What more do you desire?",
  "30468": "I hope you found him able to sign, seal, and deliver?",
  "30469": "What will you say to them?",
  "30470": "When was it, that I first began?",
  "30471": "What have ye to say, ye rebellious children, why vengeance should not be done upon you?",
  "30472": "Corfu, did you say?",

  "30495": "Set sail, shall we?",
  "30496": "What did which do?",
  "30497": "A brother?",

  "30585": "Is that the way you're leaving me?",
  "30586": "What do you mean to do?",
  "30587": "And agreeably to this mode of thinking and speaking, were we not saying that they will have their pleasures and pains in common?",
  "30588": "Are there no workhouses?",
  "30589": "Why all these precautions?",

  "30593": "What more does man want to know, than that the hand or power that made these things is divine, is omnipotent?",
  "30594": "AND YE LOOKED ON AT IT ALL?",
  "30595": "You're afraid of our getting the better of you, are you?",
  "30596": "And what was the end of the affair?",

  "30600": "Have you read much?",
  "30601": "What is it that you have come to ask of me?",
  "30602": "You remember the cry in the back lane?",
  "30603": "What are these beasts for?",
  "30604": "Were the messages spurious, after all?",
  "30605": "And what was the whole of the business worth?",
  "30606": "Why is this right, which is at bottom the right of property itself, denied to the workingman?",
  "30607": "Why did I live?",

  "30616": "Shall I beseech him, then?",
  "30617": "Whose picture is this?",
  "30618": "There's no doubt about her being one of the gang, I suppose?",

  "30621": "How have they made their fortunes?",
  "30622": "How do they treat the task I have undertaken in reviving and restoring to the world the now forgotten order of chivalry?",
  "30623": "What do you think of her now?",
  "30624": "And ignorance and folly are inanitions of the soul?",
  "30625": "What is that opinion?",
  "30626": "Would she cry, and wish that she had a right to put her arms around his neck and comfort him?",
  "30627": "How are they getting on with the fight?",
  "30628": "Who was I?",
  "30629": "Except yourself?",
  "30630": "And how is that?",
  "30631": "And that what seems to be abuse in the expression is high praise?",
  "30632": "Who is papa?",
  "30633": "Which side of a tree does the moss grow on?",
  "30634": "Does she live near you, sir?",
  "30635": "Was this the old life?",
  "30636": "Then why not settle the whole thing, once and for all?",
  "30637": "Before we took shipping, I was often asked by some of the crew, whether I had performed the ceremony above mentioned?",
  "30638": "Don't you?",
  "30639": "Where's the conductor?",
  "30640": "Were there any other passengers in the mail?",
  "30641": "How dare you touch me?",
  "30642": "Don't you think it's blowing a bit hard?",
  "30643": "You ain't the bravest man in the world, are you?",
  "30644": "But I don't think I could get any money at that for a long while, could I?",
  "30645": "Who can assert such a thing as long as no one has been caught in the act?",
  "30646": "You mean the left flank?",
  "30647": "What are you doing here, grandfather?",
  "30648": "What's wrong?",
  "30649": "She warned me to beware of her lover?",
  "30650": "Why should you think that?",
  "30651": "How so?",
  "30652": "An' where would I get em' but in the heads of your own sheep?",
  "30653": "You see that stain on the carpet?",
  "30654": "Are you rewarded, now, for your years of trouble?",
  "30655": "But won't they do anything to us?",
  "30656": "What do they accuse you of?",
  "30657": "What trees?",
  "30658": "And tell me, is there anyone who can boast of having driven a nail into the wheel of fortune?",
  "30659": "What should it be, but your trouble?",
  "30660": "Well, what do you make of it?",
  "30661": "What is the prisoner doing?",
  "30662": "When shall they be moved?",
  "30663": "Are you drunk?",
  "30664": "But if he should be at home and see me?",
  "30665": "Did you know the bear?",
  "30666": "When do you mean to set out?",
  "30667": "How does one get it?",
  "30668": "How de do?",

  "30677": "And where freedom is, the individual is clearly able to order for himself his own life as he pleases?",
  "30678": "Left?",
  "30679": "What would the brothers say?",
  "30680": "Come, that's a little TOO strong, isn't it?",
  "30681": "What say you, lad, of what people was the knave?",
  "30682": "When you know it, what will it do but aggravate your troubles?",
  "30683": "Who gave him that name, then?",
  "30684": "Are you of stout heart?",
  "30685": "Are bells and drums all that is meant by music?",
  "30686": "Will you enquire yourself?",
  "30687": "Are you mad, that you speak of such things, or am I mad to listen to them?",
  "30688": "In face of such reproaches who will wed?",
  "30689": "Diamonds on de moon, eh?",
  "30690": "Come, girls, what do you stand there for, twirling of your thumbs?",
  "30691": "And don't you want tea?",
  "30692": "What kind of a fool's counsel was I giving him?",
  "30693": "Do you think I'm a blind dodderer?",
  "30694": "Boy, do you look to the hobby?",
  "30695": "In what way has my behavior been unbecoming?",
  "30696": "Did they dream they might exterminate us?",
  "30697": "So we are to countenance things and people which we detest, merely because we are not belles and millionaires, are we?",
  "30698": "Then what are you doing here?",
  "30699": "What are you going to do with him first?",
  "30700": "Wants with it?",

  "30705": "What is it, mother?",
  "30706": "Is all of it my fault?",
  "30707": "Has it lied?",
  "30708": "But what turned out to be the case?",
  "30709": "Are you angry then?",
  "30710": "At what value do you estimate your horse and cabriolet?",
  "30711": "What would my son, sir?",
  "30712": "Quarter?",
  "30713": "Which know'd the most of the country they passed over, do you suppose?",
  "30714": "Cousin, how do you like this gentleman's verses?",
  "30715": "Did they really express pain?",
  "30716": "Why not animal flesh?",
  "30717": "Perhaps YOU don't?",
  "30718": "Where are you from?",
  "30719": "What, these waggons may coldly exclude?",
  "30720": "Does not the divine appear to you to be that which naturally orders and rules, and the mortal to be that which is subject and servant?",
  "30721": "Is it not probable that one who, out of doors, goes thus exposed to the cold, must want food and other necessaries at home?",
  "30722": "Where am I to find him?",
  "30723": "Did he come on purpose?",
  "30724": "Where in the world am I to look for him?",
  "30725": "Are you a knight of those two orders, monsieur?",
  "30726": "Now can you conceive of any interest that your heroic deputy could possibly have had in the destruction of that letter?",
  "30727": "Where are you staying?",
  "30728": "What pretense is there for it?",
  "30729": "You wished to see me?",

  "30738": "Are they growing into worthy citizens, eh?",
  "30739": "How should you, a wheelwright, have anything to say about the book which I am reading?",
  "30740": "Did he really say so?",
  "30741": "But wherefore reveal, and wherefore warn?",

  "30755": "What trouble would it be to you?",
  "30756": "What is it you imagine?",
  "30757": "You are still in weak health?",
  "30758": "Would you like me to stay?",
  "30759": "What did he know?",
  "30760": "Can't you see, I'm not well?",
  "30761": "And what is the news?",
  "30762": "Has he so little pity or compunction?",
  "30763": "What can I say more?",
  "30764": "To be suffocated?",
  "30765": "Whose fault was it?",
  "30766": "Then where's the difficulty?",
  "30767": "Did, eh?",
  "30768": "And shall we let a mawkish sentiment sweep away the culture of our fathers or the hope of our children?",
  "30769": "Who comprehends her?",

  "30786": "Why should you, with so much energy and talent?",
  "30787": "Have you any pain?",
  "30788": "How could it be possible to make the unmoral being moral or immoral?",
  "30789": "Is his merit, on that account, a lesser one?",
  "30790": "Did she?",
  "30791": "And is not the love of learning the love of wisdom, which is philosophy?",
  "30792": "Are you so everlastin' anxious to land him alone?",
  "30793": "What colour do you want the mare to be?",
  "30794": "You are afraid of something?",
  "30795": "And how did he get it?",
  "30796": "He is paid for his pastime, isn't he?",
  "30797": "Is not that a mean whereby we do acknowledge him to be the sole giver of all whatsoever is good?",
  "30798": "What was going to happen?",
  "30799": "Are you reckoning on his money?",
  "30800": "Why has he come to spoil it all?",
  "30801": "Sorry for what?",
  "30802": "What o'clock was it?",
  "30803": "And do you believe that I love you with all my heart and all my strength and all my soul?",
  "30804": "Why do you change like this?",
  "30805": "Is it a broad sheet of water?",
  "30806": "Do you understand this feeling?",
  "30807": "Where does that man live?",
  "30808": "Would you be willing to sell your inn?",
  "30809": "What do you want to do with him?",
  "30810": "Then you ARE going to be married, sir?",

  "30816": "What sundial?",
  "30817": "Could this too be a proud rejection of sympathy and help?",
  "30818": "A fine room, is it not?",
  "30819": "Do I?",
  "30820": "If there is no love, what is there?",
  "30821": "Will you kiss me on it then?",
  "30822": "Why stay ye not when ye come?",

  "30829": "What do you here on my land?",
  "30830": "Do you care for taters?",
  "30831": "Have you loved many women before me?",
  "30832": "Can you reconstruct the real face from them?",
  "30833": "Shall I?",
  "30834": "Can you ask it?",
  "30835": "Is he a farmer?",
  "30836": "And can ye still his cold remains pursue?",
  "30837": "No, how could she?",
  "30838": "Will you forget me?",
  "30839": "Are little things more subtle than big things?",

  "31682": "What are they talking about, and why doesn't he go back?",
  "31683": "Hadn't you better take up some line where they'll come in handy?",
  "31684": "Yes, that's it, she means to elope with him, but what am I to do?",
  "31685": "Leave tonight?",
  "31686": "What would you throw out?",
  "31687": "How would you like being kept awake for an hour in the middle of the night because her ladyship wouldn't go to sleep?",
  "31688": "What did the king say to you?",

  "31701": "Whatever do you mean?",
  "31702": "And what went wrong?",
  "31703": "Yes honey, but what's the matter with you, precious?",
  "31704": "Will not the capture of one army after another satisfy him, must all become prisoners?",
  "31705": "How will they get at it?",
  "31706": "Expenses paid, and a moderate screw?",
  "31707": "Was she expecting a visitor?",
  "31708": "Thinks I, what does it mean?",
  "31709": "Were's it gorn?",
  "31710": "How's that?",
  "31711": "Now you, sir, will you answer me or not?",

  "31744": "Did I not give express orders that I would have no smoking in the office?",
  "31745": "Alive?",
  "31746": "And yet what necessity was there for his having a regular master?",
  "31747": "And who on earth, after the daily experience we have, can question the probability of a gentleman marrying anybody?",

  "32433": "Can I not read your heart?",
  "32434": "You don't KNOW?",
  "32435": "What, it seems I do not drink but by an attorney?",
  "32436": "What was the cause of this flaw?",
  "32437": "Shall I give her?",
  "32438": "Was it right to be frightened already?",
  "32439": "Why can't they do as I have done, ma'am?",
  "32440": "At what hour would you wish the ceremony performed?",
  "32441": "Do you mean a compliment?",
  "32442": "Do you not know that there is a spirit within you different from flesh?",
  "32443": "In this painful moment can the best of fathers wish to destroy my domestic happiness, the only kind which now remains to me?",
  "32444": "What struggle was going on within him?",
  "32445": "So that he still expects his money?",
  "32446": "Why don't you open the door for papa?",
  "32447": "What will become of us if she dies, as I always fear when her face is like that?",
  "32448": "And if not, is he a devil?",
  "32449": "You your command, and I my title?",
  "32450": "Why has she not written to me, then?",
  "32451": "By this train?",
  "32452": "Are they good to eat?",
  "32453": "Will we trample again upon that torn and mangled corpse?",
  "32454": "And who can wonder if it be so, mother?",
  "32455": "Are you comfortable now, sir?",
  "32456": "Swear it was not true?",
  "32457": "What good was moral support in providing a million and a half?",
  "32458": "But can you restore him back to life?",
  "32459": "You won't consider me in your debt?",
  "32460": "I hope you're well?",
  "32461": "Did he designedly conceal some incident of his captivity?",
  "32462": "You remember that young fellow mother wanted me to have?",
  "32463": "So there are fashions, nowadays, in illness, are there?",
  "32464": "Then, sir, you are a favourite, I find, among the ladies?",
  "32465": "Do he rave about his mother just the same, poor fellow?",
  "32466": "Where is it?",
  "32467": "Yours then are rather here?",
  "32468": "Are you in a position to quit the post of superintendent at this moment?",
  "32469": "Do you observe anything remarkable about that?",
  "32470": "How was this to be done?",
  "32471": "Have you never heard talk of a certain secret?",
  "32472": "Did he come here voluntarily?",
  "32473": "Wouldn't you?",
  "32474": "What do you really think of her?",
  "32475": "When did he give it you?",
  "32476": "Unintentionally?",
  "32477": "Harry?",
  "32478": "Am I to come home?",
  "32479": "And the result of the examination?",
  "32480": "His ELDER brother?",
  "32481": "Perhaps he was expected to utter certain words?",
  "32482": "Supposing he is loyal, can any of his requests be granted, and if any, which of them?",
  "32483": "Are you sure you are more reasonable?",
  "32484": "Shall I go in first?",
  "32485": "What will you warm yourself with this winter?",
  "32486": "How is it they come to you?",
  "32487": "What have you got there?",
  "32488": "Have you your carriage?",
  "32489": "Do you think that you will catch anything?",
  "32490": "What is she lying down for?",
  "32491": "Who said she knew him?",
  "32492": "How do you find yourself this morning, sir?",
  "32493": "And what would you call this?",
  "32494": "How think you of that?",
  "32495": "Does she?",
  "32496": "What is that water?",
  "32497": "Going on?",
  "32498": "What palace may it deck?",
  "32499": "Reversed?",
  "32500": "Are you going to sit down, or are you not?",
  "32501": "Oh, master, what are you saying?",
  "32502": "Don't you remember that THAT, originally, was what we were to get her for?",
  "32503": "Were you ever there?",
  "32504": "Ain't you going to do anything, sir?",
  "32505": "Do you see what a villain he is?",
  "32506": "Don't you think a good deal is done when you come out and talk to me this way?",
  "32507": "And yet, when I was at my father's, did not the men give up their gayest balls and parties in order to pass the evening with me?",
  "32508": "But I want to know why the word 'moor' should have been written?",
  "32509": "We sent you wine?",
  "32510": "When did you get the letter?",
  "32511": "What is indispensable to you?",
  "32512": "What have I said?",
  "32513": "But how could you be sure I would know it?",
  "32514": "Tell me, I entreat of you, who and what you are?",
  "32515": "Had he not seduced his sisters, one after the other?",
  "32516": "Might I speak to you with regard to that matter of his grace, sir?",
  "32517": "You mean to say our old raft warn't smashed all to flinders?",
  "32518": "Must I close this?",
  "32519": "The world is surely not worth living in now, is it?",
  "32520": "And was this the man?",
  "32521": "What's the time?",
  "32522": "What's queer?",
  "32523": "But was he a lawyer after all?",
  "32524": "What house will they take?",
  "32525": "Was it well?",
  "32526": "Could it be done?",
  "32527": "Why should I stand in a comrade's way?",
  "32528": "What else should I stay on for?",
  "32529": "What beings surround me?",
  "32530": "What judgment?",
  "32531": "D'Epinay?",
  "32532": "Well, hain't he got a father?",
  "32533": "Are you certain of what you say, monsieur?",
  "32534": "And the reason is that each part of him is doing its own business, whether in ruling or being ruled?",
  "32535": "You want it, I expect?",
  "32536": "Had he been fooled once more?",
  "32537": "Do you seriously believe that that machine has travelled into time?",
  "32538": "What says our graver sister?",
  "32539": "Can I do anything?",
  "32540": "Ain't you seen the rag this week?",
  "32541": "What passage is that?",
  "32542": "But does she now dissolve the union?",
  "32543": "Any way out of that yard, now?",
  "32544": "Waw shouldn't I git a bit o me own back?",
  "32545": "Have those who have had their share in oligarchies been peculiarly wise and peculiarly devoted to the common good?",
  "32546": "What was there to be done in the village?",
  "32547": "What should I tell?",
  "32548": "Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad?",
  "32549": "To what purpose?",
  "32550": "And if it is labor that creates wealth and legitimates property, how explain the consumption of the idler?",
  "32551": "What did you mean by that?",
  "32552": "Well, what do YOU make of it?",
  "32553": "Are there any?",
  "32554": "And if I refuse to retract, you wish to fight, do you?",
  "32555": "Dora, what has happened to you?",
  "32556": "Where have you been sleeping all this week?",
  "32557": "But what do you gather from it?",
  "32558": "Well, ain't you going to save any of it?",
  "32559": "Then how could you know?",
  "32560": "Are you much hurt?",
  "32561": "Daunted?",
  "32562": "And why should you try to deceive me by telling a tale?",
  "32563": "Can I come, with my doll?",
  "32564": "Are you sorry for hiring me, master?",
  "32565": "Yes my boy?",
  "32566": "Why this man saved and that man lost?",
  "32567": "Aren't they beautiful?",
  "32568": "How has my judgment wander'd?",
  "32569": "You know what I mean?",
  "32570": "What, sweetheart?",
  "32571": "What sort of a place is it?",
  "32572": "Well, I vow, that's what the sea folks call sailing UNDER BARE POLES, come true, aint it?",
  "32573": "Who took his hands out of mine?",
  "32574": "I insist upon your living, do you hear?",
  "32575": "Why on earth did you ask him to dine with us?",
  "32576": "A man's or a woman's?",
  "32577": "Was she sheering off?",
  "32578": "What say your old men?",
  "32579": "Monsieur d'Artagnan, will you do me a favor?",
  "32580": "Are not the quail, the pigeon and the partridge the natural prey of the hawk?",
  "32581": "From the country, I see, sir?",
  "32582": "Would prudence or gratitude allow the pontiffs to renounce their benefactor?",
  "32583": "Why must their ruffs be always crinkled like endive leaves, and not crimped with a crimping iron?",
  "32584": "To whom is it they should have recourse?",
  "32585": "But who is there that ever heard of such an instinct?",
  "32586": "Well, but what am I to do?",
  "32587": "Subdivide?",
  "32588": "What is the colour of the men?",
  "32589": "What's the pay?",
  "32590": "Because I sigh when thinking of some one I am leaving?",
  "32591": "Whom did you play with?",
  "32592": "Do they work worse?",
  "32593": "You're not worried about anything?",
  "32594": "Are you sure you know the way?",
  "32595": "Why not make him a doctor like his father?",
  "32596": "But what was that to her, or to any one but myself?",
  "32597": "A little fancy work?",
  "32598": "Where are you off to?",
  "32599": "Yes, but if we can't help them?",
  "32600": "What's set you a snivelling now?",
  "32601": "And who is to do the parish work?",
  "32602": "Are you well fed?",
  "32603": "Well, why don't they support us?",
  "32604": "How many years do you mean to live after I am gone?",
  "32605": "What could these people do?",
  "32606": "Do you think I would leave you?",
  "32607": "And what do you call all this?",
  "32608": "Is it anything bad?",
  "32609": "Is it of course?",
  "32610": "But now what?",
  "32611": "Where is it?",
  "32612": "Would these two travellers make much difference to the horses, if we took them with us?",
  "32613": "Shall we not bear the trials of life a little longer in patience?",
  "32614": "How can they recognize you, if you act in such a manner that no one can recognize you?",
  "32615": "What is it you smell of?",
  "32616": "Forgotten, indeed?",
  "32617": "Were you at the performance last evening?",
  "32618": "How have you got on?",
  "32619": "Why had she allowed him to understand that he was master of her heart?",
  "32620": "Paying the money, I suppose?",
  "32621": "May one venture to ask you, monsieur, on what you have reflected?",
  "32622": "Are you, then, a coward?",
  "32623": "Would it not be safer and more certain if I should ask him his name and tell him yours?",
  "32624": "Why, how did he come here, mother?",
  "32625": "You'll get down, brother, won't you, and take something?",
  "32626": "Why do you say that, when you are going to this terrible war, and he is so old?",
  "32627": "Under what law, and for what offence?",
  "32628": "Easily?",
  "32629": "Why did he not take her in his arms and swear that he would never leave her?",
  "32630": "DID you hear that?",
  "32631": "Is the committee willing to hear this witness?",
  "32632": "Would you care for it?",
  "32633": "Who will be waiting for me beyond the ditch?",
  "32634": "May I?",
  "32635": "What is the stone called?",
  "32636": "Now, sir, tell me who and what that woman was?",
  "32637": "Are you one?",
  "32638": "Married?",
  "32639": "Will that do now?",
  "32640": "How shall I put it on?",
  "32641": "And to what purpose?",
  "32642": "Mouston?",
  "32643": "How is your dear mother getting on?",
  "32644": "But you know how it all ended, don't you?",
  "32645": "Why did we choose it, this foolish task?",
  "32646": "Are you an alienist?",
  "32647": "Cannot ate it?",
  "32648": "You won't give it up?",
  "32649": "You are, I imagine, still of the same opinion?",
  "32650": "Or not you so much, perhaps, as your friend in the city?",
  "32651": "Did you ask her how much?",
  "32652": "Is there no force on this side of the creek?",
  "32653": "If I guess rightly, will you confess it?",
  "32654": "Did you ever hear a definition of fame, sir?",
  "32655": "Ay, but how shall we know the catchpole?",
  "32656": "What harm is there in that?",
  "32657": "Why are there men and women that while they are nigh me the sunlight expands my blood?",
  "32658": "Why, according to popular belief is it rather characterised by the very contrary?",
  "32659": "Shall we hold it as a province and govern it by despotic power?",
  "32660": "My dear doctor, what is my wife's complaint?",
  "32661": "Do we go all the way today?",
  "32662": "Oh, what does that matter?",
  "32663": "What place was there in her mind for a remonstrance to lodge in?",
  "32664": "Really and truly?",
  "32665": "If that were so, what had become of my father?",
  "32666": "But where is the last year's snow?",
  "32667": "How much will you ask to stay with her till the end?",
  "32668": "What can it be?",
  "32669": "Of whom are you jealous, now?",
  "32670": "What was the sense of that?",
  "32671": "I felt very ignorant, but what could I do?",
  "32672": "And what are you going to do with yourself now, if I may ask?",
  "32673": "What interest of hers was affected by the treaty?",
  "32674": "An order to who?",
  "32675": "Which is the stronger, the small stick that first PRODUCES the fire, or the fire itself?",
  "32676": "So you've been at the club?",
  "32677": "Don't you really?",
  "32678": "Has he been a good soldier except the desertion?",
  "32679": "Do you think not?",
  "32680": "O, it an't?",
  "32681": "What you mought call me?",
  "32682": "Full of hope?",
  "32683": "And who will go?",
  "32684": "What is the news, whence is thy embassage?",
  "32685": "Farther?",
  "32686": "Should he slip away after having come and peeped into the barricade?",
  "32687": "Perhaps?",
  "32688": "Very well, my dear sir, and how does that concern us?",
  "32689": "But will the wild ass submit to the bonds?",
  "32690": "Where is the count?",
  "32691": "A whole one, and in a candlestick?",
  "32692": "Are you?",
  "32693": "Are you going to remain as you are, dear princess?",
  "32694": "What might have been your opinion of the place?",
  "32695": "Who defeated it?",
  "32696": "Plantation hand?",
  "32697": "For us, also?",
  "32698": "What is to be done with them?",
  "32699": "What would the life of a man be if he could feel no fear or repulsion?",
  "32700": "Is it really so that I may understand you, sir?",
  "32701": "Well, dad, what do you say about it?",
  "32702": "With what consolations can those, who have thus miscarried in their chief design, elude the memory of their ill success?",
  "32703": "Why did she love everything so tenderly and so passionately, everything living that was not a man?",
  "32704": "In favor of some member of your family?",
  "32705": "You are angry, monsieur?",
  "32706": "What, he told you so, I suppose?",
  "32707": "What, have they buried him in honour for his services to them?",
  "32708": "To stand from fear set free?",
  "32709": "You are aware, I suppose, that all mythology and poetry is a narration of events, either past, present, or to come?",
  "32710": "Why do you go, sir?",
  "32711": "You called my father 'Michael' as if you knew him well?",
  "32712": "This DETOUR has been entirely for our benefit, then?",
  "32713": "What do you tell me?",
  "32714": "What was she like now?",
  "32715": "Call the captain, and heave the ship aback?",
  "32716": "And did you observe any change in her then?",
  "32717": "Flee alone, and leave you here?",
  "32718": "Can I have lost it?",
  "32719": "Are the sacrifices I have made of honour and modesty to you no proof of my being tied to you in bonds too strong to be broken?",
  "32720": "But what makes you so much out of sorts?",
  "32721": "Why, wherefore stay you?",
  "32722": "Who asked him while I was away?",
  "32723": "Don't you hear it?",
  "32724": "Jarndyce?",
  "32725": "Why, what's the matter?",
  "32726": "What does it depend upon?",
  "32727": "Now will you learn not to answer back when I speak to you?",
  "32728": "And what you think of it?",
  "32729": "But, on the other hand, did not the people evince decided obstinacy and insubordination?",
  "32730": "And my making it easy for you to see the child?",
  "32731": "Has anyone an interest in preventing your arrival there?",
  "32732": "Do you abuse your teacher?",
  "32733": "Has it struck you that we may not now choose to give over?",
  "32734": "And how do you like the place?",
  "32735": "Why do you not sit by his side and begin talking to him and asking him questions?",
  "32736": "You say papa will get better, and why shouldn't he?",
  "32737": "What have you got to be afraid of?",
  "32738": "What used he to say?",
  "32739": "Where the devil is mine?",
  "32740": "How do you feel yourself?",
  "32741": "That millions of others still exist, which are too minute for any observation?",
  "32742": "I suppose we might call her that?",
  "32743": "Don't you know that it is only very foolish folk who talk sense all the time?",
  "32744": "What's that to me?",
  "32745": "But you are sure you can act your part, and disguise your voice so that he may mistake that, as he has already mistaken your person?",
  "32746": "What would it matter if you smashed to smithereens at the end of the run, after a bust like that?",
  "32747": "Can someone have guessed our secret and dug up the watch?",
  "32748": "But what could he do but just let her see that he would make anything, everything, for her, as honourably easy as possible?",
  "32749": "How many cartridges did you say you had left?",
  "32750": "What then is worth being valued?",
  "32751": "What does this avail?",
  "32752": "This, then, was his father's residence?",
  "32753": "Fisher?",
  "32754": "Ain't there a small drop of something queer about that, eh?",
  "32755": "How like you that answer?",
  "32756": "But what shall we do?",
  "32757": "If it is a friend, why does he not show himself?",
  "32758": "Who then must decide?",
  "32759": "Can we with propriety suffer them to be rulers?",
  "32760": "Have you been here long?",
  "32761": "But why didn't you tell me?",
  "32762": "How can they suit each other?",
  "32763": "Do you see these?",
  "32764": "How do you prove that?",
  "32765": "Arsenic?",
  "32766": "Now, sir, what have you to say to me?",
  "32767": "I suppose we're going to have a talk about this?",
  "32768": "Let 'em both wait?",
  "32769": "Perhaps you would not mind walking to town with me?",
  "32770": "Love had bandaged his eyes, in order to lead him whither?",
  "32771": "It is not my intention to detain the reader by expa?",
  "32772": "Why ask?",
  "32773": "Am I to read this?",
  "32774": "Who are you then?",
  "32775": "Was there nothing to fear?",
  "32776": "But did this man hope to conceal himself effectually behind that heap of rubbish, which one need but skirt?",
  "32777": "Then it all depends on that object that you regard, for your reasons, as evidence?",
  "32778": "What if there was no rank of life in which she could now properly attach herself?",
  "32779": "Why then do philosophers look for public spirit?",
  "32780": "How many would he have?",
  "32781": "But do you know this mysterious count is a bachelor?",
  "32782": "Why strive for a coherent, satisfied life?",
  "32783": "You won't throw any more stones, will you?",
  "32784": "Intelligent you call yourselves, do you?",
  "32785": "Did men eat men?",
  "32786": "That is, he was not a boy at all, I suppose?",
  "32787": "Who knew what would have saved him?",
  "32788": "Could he not annul the verdict?",
  "32789": "How can something come out of nothing?",
  "32790": "And now, he said, what did we just now call that principle which repels the even?",
  "32791": "What is that error?",
  "32792": "What is this place?",
  "32793": "Guy, is this amount of confidence to be our stock to start the new life on?",
  "32794": "How is your head, better?",
  "32795": "What matters that?",
  "32796": "The opportunity is a good one, then?",
  "32797": "But if, in spite of all my precautions, I am at last obliged to fight, will you not be my second?",
  "32798": "May I ask you to be so kind as to inquire of all your subjects if any of them have seen a fishing hook lost in the sea?",
  "32799": "And what is your business?",
  "32800": "Had I better wait till it's three o'clock?",
  "32801": "Remember me, don't you?",
  "32802": "Aren't there really?",
  "32803": "Why are you not eating anything, gentlemen?",
  "32804": "But opals are unlucky, aren't they?",
  "32805": "Does this not amount to your stealing the annual salary from your lord?",
  "32806": "Who'd you reckon?",
  "32807": "WILL IT BE COMMUNISM?",
  "32808": "Are you a married man, sir?",
  "32809": "What dream we of?",
  "32810": "What's the good of taking it in hand now?",
  "32811": "But if he does not come?",
  "32812": "Have you any idea what became of them?",
  "32813": "Are you the little girl that comes out with the lady an' four horses?",
  "32814": "And why this ABSOLUTISM in the relations of capitalist and laborer?",
  "32815": "Is any man termed a gentleman, that is not always in the fashion?",
  "32816": "Do I ever leave you?",
  "32817": "Are you all of the same opinion?",
  "32818": "Whose was this mighty personality?",
  "32819": "Perhaps you could name the figures of a few wiolincellers of a good tone?",
  "32820": "Why don't you take it?",
  "32821": "To marrying whom?",
  "32822": "Am I wrong to come up here to see her?",
  "32823": "You heard my question?",
  "32824": "Why now should I be tempted?",
  "32825": "I'm afraid I've given you a good deal of trouble, haven't I?",
  "32826": "Where's my maid?",
  "32827": "You're able to read?",
  "32828": "What has he lived on since?",
  "32829": "And you resent it?",
  "32830": "Was it not rather a service and a kindly act?",
  "32831": "Won't that do as well?",
  "32832": "Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?",
  "32833": "How could there be when it's barely ten o'clock yet?",
  "32834": "And have you got a paper?",
  "32835": "Where is the girl who promised to marry any one who would release her brother?",
  "32836": "And all arithmetic and calculation have to do with number?",
  "32837": "How do you happen to be here?",
  "32838": "And what is the result?",
  "32839": "Don't you see that all this leads to comfort in the end?",
  "32840": "And for what have you ruined your life, if you come to think of it?",
  "32841": "Who talks of cadeaux?",
  "32842": "But did you not read that I must be alone?",
  "32843": "Do you find the prisoner guilty or not guilty?",
  "32844": "But what's happened to you?",
  "32845": "Are you lost or have the wolves eaten you?",
  "32846": "Yet why do tears blind my eyes?",
  "32847": "Why should I still be subject to these visitations of the devil, when I try so hard to keep him away?",
  "32848": "How do you know what I think?",
  "32849": "But why was the tear in her eye?",
  "32850": "Are you lonesome because you're a magician?",
  "32851": "What had taken place during those ten months?",
  "32852": "You accuse him, then?",

  "32854": "John, which way must we now turn?",
  "32855": "Was I not right?",
  "32856": "Why so breathless a start?",
  "32857": "And have we, at our age, been earnestly discoursing with one another all our life long only to discover that we are no better than children?",
  "32858": "Do you want to go with us?",
  "32859": "Who had taken the letters, if letters there were?",
  "32860": "At any rate, they are all reconciled to it now, I hope?",

  "32875": "Why can't you wait?",
  "32876": "You have come far?",
  "32877": "But is she not awfully rich?",
  "32878": "Who can make good coffee?",
  "32879": "So we had better leave you?",

  "32883": "Did you observe the colour?",
  "32884": "Nothing that can't be got over, perhaps, after all?",
  "32885": "Can it be?",

  "32897": "Shall I lend you a hand here?",
  "32898": "Damn you, what do you mean by that?",
  "32899": "And who's that tall chap standing beside her?",
  "32900": "Would any one deny this?",
  "32901": "And you didn't give him the oysters?",
  "32902": "Did they impose on each industry a proportional tax, so as to preserve a balance in the market?",
  "32903": "What should you do in my place?",
  "32904": "What more could one ask for?",
  "32905": "For who can change men's opinions?",
  "32906": "Have you decided?",

  "32912": "Do you stand me out, mistress?",
  "32913": "How is the poor woman?",
  "32914": "Or, that she should prefer the rant of flattery to the simple accents of sincerity?",
  "32915": "Are you a gentleman?",
  "32916": "How do yer see that?",
  "32917": "Did you speak?",
  "32918": "Shall I see you again before your departure?",
  "32919": "And how are the other people getting on?",
  "32920": "Whah did ye cum from?",
  "32921": "Why should I not go?",
  "32922": "And if they are not fortifying, sire?",
  "32923": "But hark, what music is that?",
  "32924": "What do you suppose they would do to a man disarmed like me?",
  "32925": "Are you really frightened, madame?",
  "32926": "What are you doing, you stupid creature?",
  "32927": "Who will undertake it, if it be not also a service of honour?",
  "32928": "What have you heard?",
  "32929": "But as for me, what solace had I when the days of my fighting were done?",
  "32930": "You were not unfortunate, and yet you are an orphan, fatherless and motherless?",
  "32931": "Would not that have been better evidence?",
  "32932": "Where was my head when I made that grant?",
  "32933": "Wherein, then, lay the resemblance that made the young man's heart beat with a kind of retrospective excitement?",
  "32934": "How will she take it?",
  "32935": "And you order me to announce you to the duchess?",
  "32936": "What more has happened?",
  "32937": "Why did you not tell me, instead of teasing me like this?",
  "32938": "Judah told you?",
  "32939": "So far we are within the bounds of possibility, are we not?",
  "32940": "Will the train soon be in?",
  "32941": "What is your opinion?",
  "32942": "How was it, having so little in reality to conceal, that I always DID feel as if this man were finding me out?",
  "32943": "But isn't there another thing to be done?",
  "32944": "What I wanted, who can say?",
  "32945": "Do you suppose I don't think about that myself?",
  "32946": "Where is thy victory?",
  "32947": "Oh come, now, you don't mean to let on that you LIKE it?",
  "32948": "And pray how do I and these my friends around me seem to you?",
  "32949": "Ah, are you composing poetry, queen?",
  "32950": "What is the use of being exquisite if you are not seen by the best judges?",
  "32951": "Then what was the use of our coming?",
  "32952": "Why do you disappoint me so?",
  "32953": "Are you a child or a teetotum?",
  "32954": "Take head?",
  "32955": "The date?",
  "32956": "Then, when your articled time is over, you'll be a regular lawyer, I suppose?",
  "32957": "Would I do him this favour?",
  "32958": "Do you mind if I go in and tell this man to come on to us when he's finished here?",
  "32959": "Is it in this particular part, or in that other?",
  "32960": "Haven't I seen you blowing as hot as you please?",
  "32961": "Are you ready to get back the trade on those terms?",
  "32962": "To what does your ambition aspire?",
  "32963": "And all complaining, accusing?",
  "32964": "Is she like me?",
  "32965": "What, none of you?",
  "32966": "I am not blushing, for I don't think I need blush about it, need I?",
  "32967": "You will fulfill your promise to me?",
  "32968": "What sort of animal is this interest?",
  "32969": "You must have known that?",
  "32970": "Was it not I?",
  "32971": "And am I dishonest?",
  "32972": "What's the letter?",
  "32973": "Would it please you to accompany her upon the lake?",
  "32974": "Ladies and gentlemen, what is your opinion on the subject?",
  "32975": "What do you want, sir?",
  "32976": "And where can a man seek ends of any sort beyond this broad field?",
  "32977": "How came you to make such a mistake as this?",
  "32978": "Is it too late?",
  "32979": "How do you feel now?",
  "32980": "Anne, did YOU put sugar in these peas?",
  "32981": "That is to say, justice is useful when money is useless?",
  "32982": "Is not this second infinite, so to speak, subjacent to the first?",
  "32983": "And he said nothing as he died?",
  "32984": "WHO forbade you?",
  "32985": "Gallia out of place?",
  "32986": "And am I not ready to do so again?",
  "32987": "Frightened of what?",
  "32988": "Where do we go first?",
  "32989": "Where are you?",
  "32990": "How did you get yourself into this mess?",
  "32991": "It is not in your possession?",
  "32992": "Will your excellency give your name, or remain incognito?",
  "32993": "If I kept that little girl in my mind for five years, didn't I earn some part in her?",
  "32994": "Legal proceedings to prevent payment?",
  "32995": "Have you any sort of conveyance?",
  "32996": "I suppose you kissed his hand?",
  "32997": "What's in it?",
  "32998": "How dare you look into this garden?",
  "32999": "How find a straight road of progress, you men of science, of industry, of cooperation, of trades unions, and all the rest?",

  "33009": "Have the fugitives been pursued?",
  "33010": "Is he likely to marry, uncle?",
  "33011": "Not even a sou?",
  "33012": "What did he want?",
  "33013": "Of course it is very different here, but who knows how long it will last?",
  "33014": "Do you ever try to read your own face?",
  "33015": "No accident has happened to him?",
  "33016": "Yea, truly, saw ye not birdlime upon his hands?",
  "33017": "What have you to do with us?",
  "33018": "What's his name?",
  "33019": "Why, then, I would ask, do we see these lengthened shadows, which follow in the course of our political day?",
  "33020": "And how are they all?",
  "33021": "Larrey?",
  "33022": "Is this his house?",
  "33023": "Don't you think you might find some affairs there, ma'am, to interfere with?",

  "33054": "Hain't you got no principle at all?",
  "33055": "Why did I not fall in love with her then and propose to her?",
  "33056": "I suppose you've got your thumbs?",
  "33057": "Just's?",
  "33058": "And how long were you in the hole?",
  "33059": "What, all sons of silence, no spirit?",
  "33060": "If he fears me, why come hither?",
  "33061": "What do you reckon we better do, now?",
  "33062": "Was it for happiness they wept?",
  "33063": "Mother, may I sit on the sofa beside you?",
  "33064": "Don't you remember singing a song?",
  "33065": "False?",
  "33066": "Babies?",
  "33067": "Where did you address your letters, then?",
  "33068": "You know what they say?",
  "33069": "The first question is, of what nature was her communication?",
  "33070": "Why are you wandering about like an outcast?",
  "33071": "But, miss, you will hear one word?",
  "33072": "Does the count know what answer you received?",
  "33073": "Is, then, the woman, who holds out to the bitter end in her desire to have the last word, in so far virtuous?",
  "33074": "Shall we return to the camp?",
  "33075": "Query, ought it not, in strict grammar, to be injecerit, instead of infecit?",

  "33079": "Would you leave our village, desert our homes and fly before an enemy approaches?",
  "33080": "What are you to her?",
  "33081": "I expect you're feeling very 'appy today, sir?",
  "33082": "What could your ladyship propose by it?",
  "33083": "Who, then, has more luck than I have?",
  "33084": "When did they cease to be so?",
  "33085": "And what did you detect, if not gratitude?",
  "33086": "Speak I soothly, men of greenwood?",
  "33087": "Could misunderstanding be more complete, or sympathy worse misplaced?",
  "33088": "But what made her do that?",
  "33089": "But where will he touch?",
  "33090": "Now what will you take?",
  "33091": "Rupert?",
  "33092": "Do you think to overawe us by this?",

  "33140": "Or what great danger dwells upon my suit?",
  "33141": "My genus, is that you?",
  "33142": "Would you so fain have her as you pretend?",
  "33143": "What is the good of the ear if it tells you the same as the eye?",
  "33144": "Perhaps you do not wish to accept my proposition?",
  "33145": "And you repent already?",
  "33146": "An answer?",
  "33147": "Come now, that's the great thing?",
  "33148": "Was it to be in church?",
  "33149": "What do you intend to ask him?",
  "33150": "Vat I mean?",
  "33151": "Would you like to see the pawnbroker himself?",
  "33152": "Could he, too, write like that, express the melancholy of his soul in verse?",
  "33153": "So the question was, what to do?",
  "33154": "Well enough to question him in that language?",
  "33155": "But what's the meaning of it all?",
  "33156": "Then do you know what I did?",
  "33157": "Might I crave your favour to carry my name to him, and say I beg to say a word in his ear?",
  "33158": "Ah kin you tell wether I've a soul or not?",
  "33159": "What money?",
  "33160": "Is your tobacco perfumed, servant, that you swear by the sweet smoke?",
  "33161": "Could any thing worse be said of property?",

  "33170": "Next?",
  "33171": "You have heard of my dear father, then?",
  "33172": "What does he want?",
  "33173": "Or does it take a woman's heart to understand a woman's letter?",
  "33174": "Why, is there no cause?",
  "33175": "Shall I assist you in repairing your negligence?",
  "33176": "Oh, don't you know it?",

  "33625": "It's not a very nice night to be out, is it?",
  "33626": "You'll come and meet me as usual, girls?",
  "33627": "Now, had I come upon a hopeless incompatibility?",
  "33628": "Do you know what you're doing?",
  "33629": "Quite a vineyard, hey?",
  "33630": "Do I flatter myself if I allow myself to look at it in that way?",
  "33631": "Have I done right?",
  "33632": "He's all right?",
  "33633": "How can I ever thank you for all the deep obligations you impose upon me every day?",
  "33634": "Was there no loophole of escape?",
  "33635": "I suppose we must take the shapes of beasts?",
  "33636": "What are you surprised at?",
  "33637": "What did they matter when he played divinely?",
  "33638": "Tell me the why of this?",
  "33639": "But is it that makes you go?",
  "33640": "Will you graciously let me kiss your hand?",
  "33641": "Who are you to ask me my business?",
  "33642": "But does not this question make a disturbance outside of political circles?",
  "33643": "What influence can I possibly have over a bandit?",
  "33644": "Why don't you make him speak?",
  "33645": "Is there a carriage at the door?",
  "33646": "Do you still wish to do so?",
  "33647": "At all events, what use was there in delaying?",
  "33648": "And what right had she to be cross?",
  "33649": "What's the good, if you're sick with love for him?",
  "33650": "How should you?",
  "33651": "Is that fine, keen edge upon your soul that gives such avidity for holy things?",
  "33652": "What of the resemblance?",
  "33653": "Why a locksmiths' association in a village?",
  "33654": "Or must I fly the country altogether?",
  "33655": "You play cards, don't you?",
  "33656": "What would have been the result?",
  "33657": "Back at last?",
  "33658": "What else could this fragment be but the sole surviving remnant of some sumptuous mansion that once had stood on this unrivaled site?",
  "33659": "Isn't it possible to help them?",
  "33660": "In relation to what objects?",
  "33661": "You WERE afraid?",
  "33662": "Do you think I am deceiving you?",

  "33665": "What'll yer give me?",
  "33666": "Are you going to sail in?",
  "33667": "Wonder if you'll ever drag me up there?",
  "33668": "Is there any need to hurry, sir?",
  "33669": "Still I ask you, what is this to me?",
  "33670": "And leave the litter as it is?",
  "33671": "Do you advance with him?",
  "33672": "So perhaps I shall rub on?",
  "33673": "In front or behind?",
  "33674": "And by what authority?",
  "33675": "Yea, what then?",
  "33676": "I really could not say?",
  "33677": "And does he imagine that the coadjutor will put himself out for him?",
  "33678": "Do you think she will ever forget that her son is her safeguard, her shield, the pledge for her dignity, for her fortune and her life?",
  "33679": "You said prince, did you not?",
  "33680": "Are you sure they won't come and search the garret?",
  "33681": "Was it worth it?",

  "33684": "At the end of your name stands for?",
  "33685": "Is it not time to decide finally the meaning of the gift of the great fortune now all in your hand, and growing?",
  "33686": "Well, are we going to stand here all day?",
  "33687": "Have we reached the limits of what reason can supply?",
  "33688": "What should I say?",
  "33689": "What will gladden your heart?",
  "33690": "Are you sure it will be the last time?",
  "33691": "She'll do, won't she?",
  "33692": "What is that for a man to do?",
  "33693": "Since when?",
  "33694": "Why, soldiers, why?",
  "33695": "How came you to read some of those queerer ones?",
  "33696": "Did you not love your husband either?",
  "33697": "Where is true peace or true glory?",
  "33698": "How is it now?",
  "33699": "Durys?",

  "33704": "Does it belong to anybody in the neighbourhood?",
  "33705": "Has anything happened?",
  "33706": "Did you hit her?",
  "33707": "Is there any signal for the general rally?",
  "33708": "About what age is he?",
  "33709": "And why did I come here?",
  "33710": "What mercy can you expect from the man whom you have wronged?",
  "33711": "Have I taken an oath of some sort, then?",
  "33712": "Shall we say, in such a case, that the will of the majority was for the ultimate end?",
  "33713": "Where what?",
  "33714": "You say?",
  "33715": "Do you no longer like to think of your mother?",
  "33716": "What are you doing?",
  "33717": "May I understand, sir, that you threat is withdrawn, and that my income is secure?",
  "33718": "Are the two so deeply separated in this town, that there is no place whatever for an honest workman between them?",
  "33719": "Why then should a man cling to a longer stay here?",
  "33720": "The symptoms are marked, do you see?",
  "33721": "But supposing we had the authority, I would ask what good can result from the examination?",
  "33722": "What am I coming for?",
  "33723": "But settled?",
  "33724": "Did I like his voice?",
  "33725": "How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor?",
  "33726": "Who to?",
  "33727": "And the girl?",
  "33728": "Well, have you had a good hunt, have you botanised successfully?",
  "33729": "And why should you want to spite her?",
  "33730": "What did you pick me up for?",
  "33731": "And what does 'in my name' mean?",
  "33732": "What, are you all got together, like players at the end of the last act?",
  "33733": "Have you ever seen it?",
  "33734": "Isn't it the truth?",
  "33735": "When, then, did father and son exchange shields, and why?",
  "33736": "Would he have been justified in sacrificing his own child, even if he could thereby save another's?",
  "33737": "Why are you only laying one place?",
  "33738": "Loves him?",
  "33739": "Yet who are the folk whom you find HERE?",
  "33740": "Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?",
  "33741": "Who is coming in here?",
  "33742": "What was she going to say, and what reply would she get?",
  "33743": "Can you tell me how to go about getting on the stage?",
  "33744": "What was your idea, then?",
  "33745": "Running from what?",
  "33746": "Valdemar?",
  "33747": "How are you going to manage to get out?",
  "33748": "Have you a portmanteau?",
  "33749": "What does it matter?",
  "33750": "What depth have we now reached?",
  "33751": "Wouldn't you have been rude?",
  "33752": "What the deuse do we men go to school for?",
  "33753": "If it be called swamp or sky?",
  "33754": "Defend ourselves against D'Artagnan?",
  "33755": "How the devil is he so like?",
  "33756": "Once more, will you undertake it?",
  "33757": "Are not these functions proper to the soul, and can they rightly be assigned to any other?",
  "33758": "Was it sheer blind force of passion that would satisfy her now?",
  "33759": "How's this, dear niece?",
  "33760": "Do you know who that was?",
  "33761": "Was SHE at the ball too?",
  "33762": "And what made you ask it of me?",
  "33763": "Do you know that if we should ship, it would serve you quite right?",
  "33764": "Where are your wits?",
  "33765": "Is it possible, dear, that what I hear is true?",
  "33766": "No clue?",
  "33767": "Will you give me as far from the river as you can distinguish the belly of a horse?",
  "33768": "So what if he died, how did this concern the boy?",
  "33769": "Build I in the winds my dwelling?",
  "33770": "And what more free than he that desireth nothing upon earth?",
  "33771": "And you have them?",
  "33772": "But don't you love me, my dear wife, because I have been so pulled down by illness?",
  "33773": "I don't know if you notice it?",
  "33774": "Did I indeed, sir?",
  "33775": "And are greater miracles to be performed by those who do not follow his footsteps, who healed the body to reach the mind?",
  "33776": "And did I say there was any difficulty?",
  "33777": "Have I not got a brave determination of all my doubts, and a response in all things agreeable to the oracle that gave it?",
  "33778": "Could I leave the lady alone?",
  "33779": "Is it really?",
  "33780": "Don't you think I've been extraordinarily good?",
  "33781": "Do you think I'm not sufficiently ruining my health living here amid the continual emanations of the pharmacy?",
  "33782": "What be ye looking at?",
  "33783": "How should she be able to compose herself when she should first see him?",
  "33784": "But tell me, what would you have done?",
  "33785": "Confused?",
  "33786": "Wherefrom do they acquire these tendencies, these peculiarities?",
  "33787": "Who first seduced them to that foul revolt?",
  "33788": "If they want to jump down, now, and get into trouble, who objects?",
  "33789": "Do you regard that meaning as offensive?",
  "33790": "And why does the former operation end exactly when the latter commences?",
  "33791": "What is your notion?",
  "33792": "What now was my plain duty?",
  "33793": "But where can one jump to?",
  "33794": "Isn't he idle?",
  "33795": "And how were they?",
  "33796": "Who told you his name?",
  "33797": "Who and where is he?",
  "33798": "Shall we then raise cuckolds?",
  "33799": "Guess I did, didn't I?",
  "33800": "But that I make no admissions?",
  "33801": "Am I deceived?",
  "33802": "What's the good of daylight now?",
  "33803": "What are the facts?",
  "33804": "Have you nothing to say to us?",
  "33805": "Can you tell when there is a good fire?",
  "33806": "What on earth will she say to me, I wonder?",
  "33807": "Where are thy sisters?",
  "33808": "Did you anticipate the accident which has happened to your granddaughter?",
  "33809": "What cause had you to make discoveries of his pretended passion?",
  "33810": "Elopement?",
  "33811": "How shall I be able to endure life for thirteen years?",
  "33812": "How deeply sir, you apprehend it?",
  "33813": "Cake or bread and butter?",
  "33814": "Or might you have only travelled for your amusement?",
  "33815": "Who has not seen poor birds caught by their feet in the lime?",
  "33816": "I have seen you before, I think?",
  "33817": "Does not the practice of despoiling an enemy afford an excuse for not facing the battle?",
  "33818": "The place is then, as you know, determined on rebellion?",
  "33819": "And was that the upshot of my life's hardest battle?",
  "33820": "When did you shed tears over lost souls?",
  "33821": "And the chief officer?",
  "33822": "Is it not horrible?",
  "33823": "On plantation?",
  "33824": "When you say it that way it sounds comical, does it not?",
  "33825": "What did you do with the girl?",
  "33826": "Who would want to injure us, or damage the projectile?",
  "33827": "How do you distinguish them?",
  "33828": "Haidee, would it please you not to leave me?",
  "33829": "But if they don't do for us, if they're stupid?",
  "33830": "In the name of the ninth day, what manner of creature are you?",
  "33831": "It is then a service which you propose to render us, count?",
  "33832": "Whence comes this charm of the mustache, will you tell me?",
  "33833": "Why a blue coat?",
  "33834": "Are you here for good?",
  "33835": "What was I telling you?",
  "33836": "Snakes?",
  "33837": "May I ask you a question?",
  "33838": "And yet does not your honor fear to compromise yourself by allowing such a sum to be carried away for the service of your enemy?",
  "33839": "Then have we got to part?",
  "33840": "But what do you want to do with these chickens?",
  "33841": "Do you suggest that I should do that to a similarly garbed female?",
  "33842": "And if I do not read it, what shall you do, mamma?",
  "33843": "What is going on here?",
  "33844": "Can I see her first?",
  "33845": "And the profits are large?",
  "33846": "You let him go?",
  "33847": "How can he save them?",
  "33848": "Barkis, do you mean?",
  "33849": "Why don't you like her husband?",
  "33850": "All right, is it?",
  "33851": "I can't help it, can I?",
  "33852": "Is that the sort of fellow?",
  "33853": "And that's all you want?",
  "33854": "Number of what, child?",
  "33855": "Fluffed in his lines, did he?",
  "33856": "But was resistance and, in the last place, victory possible?",
  "33857": "Ought not a son to love his father, whatever happens?",
  "33858": "Why, you wished to have a talk with me when the others left?",
  "33859": "Have you ever heard anything particular respecting his birth?",
  "33860": "But how did we become engaged?",
  "33861": "Did this man belong to the double enigma of order and disorder?",
  "33862": "Then he has travelled?",
  "33863": "Will you not take my word?",
  "33864": "I pray you say, what would you ask?",
  "33865": "What is the name of this obliging youth?",
  "33866": "Don't you see their terrible eyes?",
  "33867": "Have they sentenced you?",
  "33868": "I am the ghost's accomplice?",
  "33869": "You 'eathen, where the mischief 'ave you been?",
  "33870": "And has not this been our own case in the matter of equals and of absolute equality?",
  "33871": "And if I do my duty and do right, you will sustain me, will you not?",
  "33872": "Do not you also?",
  "33873": "His race, his form, his name almost unknown?",
  "33874": "But you will see him yourself?",
  "33875": "'What do you mean?",
  "33876": "How can one talk to the masters like that?",
  "33877": "And yet they say that war is like a game of chess?",
  "33878": "But what does he want of them?",
  "33879": "Is it thy resolve that both shall die?",
  "33880": "But what's your real name?",
  "33881": "Then why did you stay with us, and blast your prospects?",
  "33882": "And the salary?",
  "33883": "Have you heard the news, sir?",
  "33884": "Or to what port are we bound?",
  "33885": "Why, then, is it, when neither law nor justice forbids it, that we are asked to spend our time and money in inquiring into its truth?",
  "33886": "And what will all her learning and her daintiness do for her, now?",
  "33887": "How has this terrible past been recalled?",
  "33888": "Am I to feed upon wisdom like a dog?",
  "33889": "Indeed, why not?",
  "33890": "Could not you, sir, estimate their maximum?",
  "33891": "Is this the fact?",
  "33892": "Barsad?",
  "33893": "I suppose you won't be back before three?",
  "33894": "And our poor cactuses, where are they?",

  "33896": "Why, what do you mean?",
  "33897": "No, but what can I do?",
  "33898": "Have they allowed the headsman to escape?",
  "33899": "Is perseverance a virtue?",
  "33900": "Can you ever forgive me?",
  "33901": "You really think that your solution must be correct?",
  "33902": "You have nothing further to say to me?",
  "33903": "Shall I cut away?",
  "33904": "Has he asked you to be his wife?",
  "33905": "Is thy daughter mine now?",
  "33906": "Now, what's up?",
  "33907": "PISTHETAERUS I?",
  "33908": "Is there anything you dislike in me that you act so contrarily to my wishes?",
  "33909": "Anger?",
  "33910": "Is it not some bad affair?",
  "33911": "Will you do it?",
  "33912": "I wonder how many I shall meet going back?",
  "33913": "Could it be possible that they had escaped?",
  "33914": "Are you SURE you were quite comfortable?",
  "33915": "Had he any weapons?",
  "33916": "Was there no way by which I might have enjoyed in freedom comforts even greater than those which I now earn by servitude?",

  "33918": "Ladies, what man's love is there that would stand a year's nursing of the object of his affection?",
  "33919": "How I gwyne to ketch her en I out in de woods?",
  "33920": "Won't you stop all night?",
  "33921": "Then why were you taught to shoot?",
  "33922": "What good comes of it?",
  "33923": "What happened to me?",
  "33924": "What was it that set our two hearts eternally apart and made hope impossible?",
  "33925": "On the contrary, don't I see every reason why I shouldn't?",
  "33926": "The captain?",
  "33927": "Ruinous, why?",
  "33928": "Couldn't you hear the noise?",
  "33929": "Was she really a stenographer?",
  "33930": "Is it possible that he died in the bitter frame of mind he was then in?",
  "33931": "And what do you reckon your outfit will cost?",
  "33932": "Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?",
  "33933": "But, by the holy city, why does he make me pay for what anybody else could have for nothing?",
  "33934": "What did he talk about?",
  "33935": "I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your sleep?",
  "33936": "Why don't you hassome supper?",
  "33937": "Who was it you were talking with over there?",
  "33938": "Mightn't I take the liberty?",
  "33939": "What if she won't?",
  "33940": "You mean that you forget?",
  "33941": "You have a chamber?",
  "33942": "What was I doing with the lady?",
  "33943": "How can ye suffer these indignities?",
  "33944": "What did they understand by it?",
  "33945": "Egad, didn't you hear?",
  "33946": "What does he wish to gain by it, I wonder?",
  "33947": "Is it not a beautiful language and admirable?",
  "33948": "Sdeath, what's this to me?",
  "33949": "Don't you know of any such place for me, sir?",
  "33950": "Why, what other strangers are coming in?",
  "33951": "Why does the parent turn away from his child, and forbid him his presence for a time?",
  "33952": "What is a shame?",
  "33953": "And you ask me, whether I am an adherent of that church which maligns and damns you?",
  "33954": "You are rich?",
  "33955": "Do you know him still?",
  "33956": "Not understand it, sir?",
  "33957": "If they were all bad, who had made them so?",
  "33958": "It's YOUR father's, isn't it?",
  "33959": "Isn't it too soon?",
  "33960": "What encouraged me not to become your surety, but to patronize you?",
  "33961": "Who ever gave again the breath of a life lost?",
  "33962": "Did he say when he would be back?",
  "33963": "Yes or no, is it an honorable indemnity?",
  "33964": "As how?",
  "33965": "Do you imagine that this anaemic youth was capable of so frightful an assault?",
  "33966": "I'd far better help you, hadn't I?",
  "33967": "How many would you have?",
  "33968": "Otherwise why should she thus have concealed herself, fled from the face of others?",
  "33969": "Any money?",
  "33970": "Where stand his coursers?",
  "33971": "You aren't sure?",
  "33972": "What are we coming to?",
  "33973": "But the real cause was heart disease?",
  "33974": "Where is your master?",
  "33975": "But does he know this secret, then?",
  "33976": "Is he liked for himself?",
  "33977": "What should it be?",
  "33978": "Anybody gone in for her?",
  "33979": "Well why don't you?",
  "33980": "We are overheard, then?",
  "33981": "You other two belong to this division?",
  "33982": "All or one?",

  "34826": "Things for sale, or do you want to sell anything?",
  "34827": "Would the matter be carried as far as that?",
  "34828": "And what does she want the money for?",
  "34829": "Still leading his life of pleasure?",
  "34830": "Has he such might as to defy us all?",
  "34831": "What makes poor scoundrel rogues to beg, I pray you?",
  "34832": "You have nothing more to ask of me, my lord?",
  "34833": "Got a pin and a pencil, some of you?",
  "34834": "Against whom?",
  "34835": "You'll let me tell you, won't you?",
  "34836": "Would you like fine horses, or it may be some one has offended you, and you would like his head?",
  "34837": "Wisdom, virtue, enlightenment?",
  "34838": "And what could they be talking about?",
  "34839": "And that which is opposed to them is one of the inferior principles of the soul?",
  "34840": "We may reply, and by what right do you demand payment from us for labor which we did not impose upon you?",
  "34841": "Is it necessary to change my frock?",
  "34842": "Do you confess that you were a wicked traitor?",
  "34843": "Didn't find anything, eh?",
  "34844": "Then why didn't you say so at first?",
  "34845": "When did it take place?",
  "34846": "And, of course, the horse and cart were ready?",
  "34847": "For who but the rich of this world can thus afford to fling pearls away?",
  "34848": "Suppose you catch it?",
  "34849": "Pip why don't you take me into your life?",
  "34850": "And be merry?",
  "34851": "What are you about?",
  "34852": "What else?",
  "34853": "What's his name and address?",
  "34854": "How many times did he call upon his father?",
  "34855": "Did not the messenger say your father's safety depended upon it?",
  "34856": "Seeing then that the immortal is indestructible, must not the soul, if she is immortal, be also imperishable?",
  "34857": "Now, at once?",
  "34858": "Are we saved?",
  "34859": "Of what consequence to science is this interminable recital of crude facts, if your analysis never extracts a single idea from them?",
  "34860": "What, my dear, are you talking about?",
  "34861": "After all, who had seen him?",
  "34862": "From such beginning of governments, what could be expected but a continued system of war and extortion?",
  "34863": "And how much did they possess?",
  "34864": "Does he limit it to the few who did him the wrong, or does he take in the many?",
  "34865": "But why should I tell you all this?",
  "34866": "Well, isn't he a nasty man to get into such staggers at a morning wake?",
  "34867": "Do you think I will not listen to you?",
  "34868": "On what road, master?",
  "34869": "Why can't they let a girl marry three men, or as many as want her, and save all this trouble?",
  "34870": "What link could there be between that creature and my wife?",
  "34871": "And do you think she is not there?",
  "34872": "The law?",
  "34873": "Will you go directly?",
  "34874": "Can it be that there remains to us only the recollection of them?",
  "34875": "Won't that be better than moping here?",
  "34876": "Not even if they were kind to you?",
  "34877": "And who will help you?",
  "34878": "And were these four men attached to each other, true in heart, really united?",
  "34879": "Have you let it?",
  "34880": "Why does the soul still tarry in my body?",
  "34881": "Who has ever heard of such a marvelous place?",
  "34882": "But in heaven's name, tell me, what was that?",
  "34883": "Where did you hear it?",
  "34884": "Do you see?",
  "34885": "And now, prisoner, will you consent to tell your name?",
  "34886": "Is he accompanied?",
  "34887": "Yes, but how?",
  "34888": "What weight can my blood add to the wool?",
  "34889": "How did he die?",
  "34890": "Says I, father, what on airth are you at?",
  "34891": "May not this prove dangerous?",
  "34892": "How is it all the better?",
  "34893": "Won't I tell mama?",
  "34894": "Don't tell me that she helped to set a trap for me?",
  "34895": "What dreadful thing will you do next?",
  "34896": "Is your wife at home?",
  "34897": "How did your tribute arise?",
  "34898": "Well, what are you doing here, and what is your name?",
  "34899": "Why shouldn't I marry her?",
  "34900": "What are you in such a hurry for?",
  "34901": "If you know my heart, then, can you not see that it is my heart I offer you?",
  "34902": "And yet how could it possibly be so?",
  "34903": "Well, are you so sure of the little gentleman?",
  "34904": "Was it you, sir?",
  "34905": "Have you noticed anything amiss with them of late?",
  "34906": "What purpose?",
  "34907": "What possessed him to do it?",
  "34908": "Or would you like another?",
  "34909": "You should sin less, and keep better in health?",
  "34910": "What advantage would it be to me to be anything else?",
  "34911": "Has your brother or the cat been meddling?",
  "34912": "Secondly, what are the best means, and the least expensive, for accomplishing those ends?",
  "34913": "Well, tell me, I have always wanted to know, did it hurt worse going in or coming out?",
  "34914": "Will I have eyes at the bottom of the sea, supposing I descend those endless stairs?",
  "34915": "You aren't angry?",
  "34916": "Do you understand it at last?",
  "34917": "Now you quit it, do you hear?",
  "34918": "What is to be done now?",
  "34919": "Has she slept through it?",
  "34920": "Was there any idea at all connected with it?",
  "34921": "Is this the man?",
  "34922": "You will take something or other, surely?",
  "34923": "Did you stop there?",
  "34924": "And where did you get so much money?",
  "34925": "But they'll recognize you?",
  "34926": "He made grandfather's coffin, didn't he?",
  "34927": "Have you any message?",
  "34928": "May I come out to you in the garden presently?",
  "34929": "Where has she gone?",
  "34930": "But what's the idea of your new picture?",
  "34931": "Why had he not known the difference between the political value and the imaginative value of these things?",
  "34932": "But would it not be salutary to give also the means of preventing their commission?",
  "34933": "Have all gentlemen's servants warts upon their noses, mother?",
  "34934": "Bene curasti hoc jumentam?",
  "34935": "Und you acknowledge tat you pe te blind dronk and te vool ?",
  "34936": "Who was right then?",
  "34937": "Don't you want to see your friends?",
  "34938": "Don't you feel well?",
  "34939": "Why to me?",
  "34940": "Did you see what a fool he looked?",
  "34941": "Perhaps a dodge?",
  "34942": "What is it for?",
  "34943": "Cannot you stay a few minutes longer?",
  "34944": "Do you refuse this lady's hand whom I now offer you?",
  "34945": "Where are you going there?",
  "34946": "Your lordship will recall inquiring of me on the night of the ball as to the bona fides of one of the temporary waiters?",
  "34947": "Would you set a cloud to chase the wind?",
  "34948": "The strength one can eke from little, who knows till he has been subjected to the trial?",
  "34949": "Would you, my reader, like to be more gentle in your manner?",
  "34950": "You had your portfolio with you, then?",
  "34951": "What is the good of repentance like that?",
  "34952": "What are ye for?",
  "34953": "They are laying supper over there, are they?",
  "34954": "You have some in the house, have you not?",
  "34955": "Am I master of the house?",
  "34956": "Did he then love the rhythmic rise and fall of words better than their associations of legend and colour?",
  "34957": "Is not the most important problem that of getting the right man at the head of the company?",
  "34958": "Now, then, who can point out any sinless person in the present world?",
  "34959": "That was really what we meant, wasn't it?",
  "34960": "You are in love?",
  "34961": "WHAT IS IT?",
  "34962": "Shall I love all men, then, for the sake of one?",
  "34963": "Need I say de more?",
  "34964": "How can they, he said, when they are not allowed to apply their minds to the callings of any of these?",
  "34965": "Are you really not to be persuaded, even now, to pass the night under my roof?",
  "34966": "What for, then?",
  "34967": "Is my husband's political career likely to suffer through this incident?",
  "34968": "Besides, where were these poor girls to go?",
  "34969": "Do you really think so?",
  "34970": "Say, that fits like a T, don't it?",
  "34971": "About what am I now employing my own soul?",
  "34972": "Do you speak by way of offence, sir?",
  "34973": "Why did you name them all with the same name?",
  "34974": "Well, I ask, what can the intervention of power, with the assistance of civil law and political economy, accomplish here?",
  "34975": "A bottle, perhaps?",
  "34976": "What do you expect to do in the midst of this darkness?",
  "34977": "You wouldn't mind that?",
  "34978": "And did she not even go to him?",
  "34979": "What other forces were arrayed?",
  "34980": "And why do they worry me so?",
  "34981": "Young men are all very well in their place, but it doesn't do to drag them into everything, does it?",
  "34982": "What becomes, then, of the doctrine of expiation and abstinence, the morality of sacrifice, resignation, and happy moderation?",
  "34983": "Can smiles make a man a better master or a better citizen?",
  "34984": "If she makes up her mind to tell you, you will come and let me know, will you not?",
  "34985": "What is this rubbish?",
  "34986": "Don't you know?",
  "34987": "What is he doing there?",
  "34988": "Suicide?",
  "34989": "Her name and family?",
  "34990": "What knave is this?",
  "34991": "But what did I know?",
  "34992": "Had he reached the point of forgetting the mayor's presence?",
  "34993": "Three?",
  "34994": "How could she do it, how can it be possible that she is a woman like that?",
  "34995": "Can we find any such connection in the case of a public work executed by a government?",
  "34996": "What sort of an entertainment, captain?",
  "34997": "How did he make it enter in?",
  "34998": "Whence, comrade?",
  "34999": "What do you reckon did it, boys?",
  "35000": "How do you help it?",
  "35001": "Is it not truly to clothe the naked, to procure for them a garment of light, a raiment of glory?",
  "35002": "Just give me one of those roses in the bunch you are wearing, will you?",
  "35003": "Harrison?",
  "35004": "Unless indeed you know me, and have some purpose in your brain?",
  "35005": "Is he conscious?",
  "35006": "Had his forms of expression changed, or his sentiments become less laudable?",
  "35007": "But what is it you wish?",
  "35008": "Why notice it?",
  "35009": "Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?",
  "35010": "On what charge?",
  "35011": "Is he not a handsome lad?",
  "35012": "Haue you hope of life?",
  "35013": "What is the remedy?",
  "35014": "You think so, do you?",
  "35015": "What would he himself say a couple of years after the event?",
  "35016": "How are you to act?",
  "35017": "Is it long since you came?",
  "35018": "By you?",
  "35019": "And will you let me play a few of your accompaniments?",
  "35020": "Sell my rapier?",
  "35021": "Is he prosperous and happy?",
  "35022": "Why will not people lend their money?",
  "35023": "Guess what?",
  "35024": "For sheer terror?",
  "35025": "Did you know this?",
  "35026": "What did I tell you about making me creak the door?",
  "35027": "And in what consists this plot?",
  "35028": "Shall I fetch you another cup?",
  "35029": "How's that for high living?",
  "35030": "Then for what reason did he call me son?",
  "35031": "And why do you keep following me about?",
  "35032": "Is it worth while to keep an army to protect you in writing proclamations, or to get once a year into winter quarters?",
  "35033": "Well, what's to be done?",
  "35034": "You mean you'll join us?",
  "35035": "Why don't you tell me what's the matter with you?",
  "35036": "Have you given this man work before?",
  "35037": "In the way, you mean, of living with US?",
  "35038": "Is he from home?",
  "35039": "Is there a house in the neighborhood?",
  "35040": "What were you doing on that armchair?",
  "35041": "What say my other friends?",
  "35042": "Some one?",
  "35043": "Do you then suspect any one?",
  "35044": "But why should you have been anxious?",
  "35045": "What size do you want to be?",
  "35046": "Now, is there any sense in these things?",
  "35047": "What manner of man is he?",
  "35048": "Don't you think it's rather a good idea?",
  "35049": "I might let that to you, for what matters it to me?",
  "35050": "What was the opinion?",
  "35051": "Whence comes this to pass, my masters?",
  "35052": "Nothing to you?",
  "35053": "Won't you be mine?",
  "35054": "I suppose you have had dinner?",
  "35055": "Where in the word did you acquire such a voluminous vocabulary?",
  "35056": "And what if other benefits were gained by peace?",
  "35057": "What is it, father?",
  "35058": "That wasn't wrong, was it?",
  "35059": "What did you tell him?",
  "35060": "From the cardinal?",
  "35061": "Is it far from here, sir?",
  "35062": "Do you mean to say you don't know where?",
  "35063": "When was he married?",
  "35064": "Don't you dread the attitude that insensibly arises out of legal obligation?",
  "35065": "And you don't want to go again to night?",
  "35066": "Was she beautiful?",
  "35067": "You're staying the night, I hope?",
  "35068": "What would I want wedding so young?",
  "35069": "What IOU's?",
  "35070": "Do you know anything?",
  "35071": "That's interesting, eh?",
  "35072": "Isn't he charming?",
  "35073": "Whither so soon?",
  "35074": "Hain't you never seen him?",
  "35075": "Did you find no trace of him?",
  "35076": "The sovereigns?",
  "35077": "A physician?",
  "35078": "Where ought I be, then?",
  "35079": "Who said that she was to belong to you?",
  "35080": "Wouldn't you go a day's journey, if you were in my place?",
  "35081": "In this place?",
  "35082": "I said 'people,' didn't I?",
  "35083": "You mean it is a little dry, perhaps?",
  "35084": "You are not touched even by that danger?",
  "35085": "Then this racket they are making is on account of it, I suppose?",
  "35086": "For what is he in prison then?",
  "35087": "Would exasperation, however, if relief had longer been postponed, finally have betrayed me?",
  "35088": "What did I mean by asking questions?",
  "35089": "Will you dance with me?",
  "35090": "Can you dive?",
  "35091": "More rabbits?",
  "35092": "For this?",
  "35093": "Was there any connection between the commotion of the atmosphere and that of the interior of the earth?",
  "35094": "Has your master come?",
  "35095": "A merry going forth bringeth often a sorrowful return, and a merry evening maketh a sad morning?",
  "35096": "And even of what he knew, how much could he make his untravelled friend either apprehend or believe?",
  "35097": "When did you enter the room?",
  "35098": "Whom have I to live for?",
  "35099": "And how about the savages?",
  "35100": "Going to lose her?",
  "35101": "For such matters?",
  "35102": "And do you object to going through the village?",
  "35103": "What do you think of that figure there?",
  "35104": "To how many people can any one tell all?",
  "35105": "Could a body hypocritically take there a small hypocritical touch?",
  "35106": "How have they made me a victim?",
  "35107": "But where can he be?",
  "35108": "How am I?",
  "35109": "And what did she say?",
  "35110": "What could he have done to me?",
  "35111": "Do you take us for thieves?",
  "35112": "For a young cobra?",
  "35113": "And how did you like the master?",
  "35114": "He won't have it?",
  "35115": "Theramenes?",
  "35116": "France?",
  "35117": "Tell me, my dear sir, do you admit the existence of volcanoes on the moon's surface?",
  "35118": "What could be the meaning of his sudden change toward me?",
  "35119": "He warned you to abandon your visit?",
  "35120": "Did you really come to propose to me?",
  "35121": "And then, you ungrateful being, you are not pleased to see an old friend?",
  "35122": "Will you return to this gang of robbers, and to this man, when a word can save you?",
  "35123": "Because of the money?",
  "35124": "Who could place my feet on the right path, and bring me back to my company?",
  "35125": "Why did you pull the curtain over the place to make me think you were still there?",
  "35126": "And are the hours the same?",
  "35127": "What is the reason?",
  "35128": "Money is no object?",
  "35129": "Where, then, could the driver be, unless he were inside the house?",
  "35130": "Nay, has not a little rationality exposed many women to the severest censure?",
  "35131": "Was that all right?",
  "35132": "What is it?",
  "35133": "Why is the ardour of youth thus to be damped, and the luxuriancy of fancy cut to the quick?",
  "35134": "If there be no distinction between the pleasing and the disgusting, why does it accept the one or reject the other?",
  "35135": "How is that?",
  "35136": "What consolation does the poor suffering soul find in the superb coffin, in the splendid funeral?",
  "35137": "And what am I myself?",
  "35138": "Egeria?",
  "35139": "Have you dined?",
  "35140": "You are very lonely, are you not?",
  "35141": "Do you try to force them?",
  "35142": "What do you all say to a wrestling match?",
  "35143": "It was very game of her, wasn't it?",
  "35144": "What will the servants think?",
  "35145": "Would it still kick and show temper, then?",
  "35146": "Does he wish us to draw conclusions?",
  "35147": "Now, what is the harvest fortnight to be?",
  "35148": "Notwithstanding your father's wishes to the contrary?",
  "35149": "How many other families have never had that same opportunity?",
  "35150": "Ye higher men, what think ye?",
  "35151": "Are there many of them?",
  "35152": "I am now among princes like myself, am I not?",
  "35153": "What do you mean by tetragones?",
  "35154": "And you have been in the choir in pursuance of your duties?",
  "35155": "If all is well, why go to the lodge?",
  "35156": "None?",
  "35157": "By what path did you get thither?",
  "35158": "Can we get behind his track so that they may smell it?",
  "35159": "You have how many new suits?",
  "35160": "How far mus go up, massa?",
  "35161": "Where's that?",
  "35162": "Is she discouraged, does she drag herself about the house and find fault with everything?",
  "35163": "What whole thing?",
  "35164": "Since it was your intention to live alone, why did you throw into the sea the document which put us on your track?",
  "35165": "If this were human life, if these were human beings, living in a complete world, then what was her own world, outside?",
  "35166": "We are at peace and, why then, should they harm us?",
  "35167": "Then you believe the papers?",
  "35168": "What must I do, officer?",
  "35169": "What do you like to talk about?",
  "35170": "Getting a bit hot, eh?",
  "35171": "If she had wished it, would she not have sent to me by this time?",
  "35172": "Or whom oppose?",
  "35173": "Was it, when he set his heart upon it?",
  "35174": "You, who refuse to tell me the slightest thing?",
  "35175": "Where's mama?",
  "35176": "Are we in any great danger?",
  "35177": "Or will a reaction set in which may arrest progress and even undo much that has been done?",
  "35178": "You are only responsible for my body, is it not so?",
  "35179": "How can you deliberately get up such paltry falsehoods?",
  "35180": "Afterwards to me?",
  "35181": "Carries a bag?",
  "35182": "Shall you not all help me?",
  "35183": "Shall I cut it out?",
  "35184": "Is it possible you don't understand that yet?",
  "35185": "Would not the doing of this be your best mode of counteracting his raid on your communications?",
  "35186": "After dinner, eh?",
  "35187": "Well, what, my dear girl?",
  "35188": "What would they say if I did not go?",
  "35189": "But to what in the world?",
  "35190": "By your leave, do you know me, sir?",
  "35191": "He will be ruined, you mean?",
  "35192": "What of the prisoner?",
  "35193": "Then it appears there will be an opposition, and the enterprise will be disputed?",
  "35194": "Have you heard?",
  "35195": "Will you dine with me?",
  "35196": "Does he ever come back to this neighborhood?",
  "35197": "Is true, as they tell me, that I can't even go away?",
  "35198": "And now, tell me your name?",
  "35199": "Do you fear their finding it here, should they come to search?",
  "35200": "If they don't look foolish its a pity?",
  "35201": "Whither are they going?",
  "35202": "Is this the gentleman's little purse?",
  "35203": "What is it, now?",
  "35204": "Was it a thicket?",
  "35205": "Was this the beginning of a happy change?",
  "35206": "Sir, may I have a few words with you concerning some business I have just decided upon?",
  "35207": "But where are you really going?",
  "35208": "What am dat?",
  "35209": "I hope there is no reason to distrust his fidelity?",
  "35210": "Of twelve rowers?",
  "35211": "How can one talk or think of such trifles?",
  "35212": "But what are we to do now?",
  "35213": "How does it happen that the presence of a woman overwhelms us so?",
  "35214": "Which do you know?",

  "35221": "What more could I hope to do by prolonging the interview?",
  "35222": "Pierced?",
  "35223": "What do you expect to get?",
  "35224": "Besides, was he not in the secret?",
  "35225": "Was it of any use to explain?",
  "35226": "How's the rheumatics?",
  "35227": "But where can one go?",
  "35228": "Where am I?",
  "35229": "Was it after all true that she had been conducting herself in a way that justified the world in thinking that she liked the man?",
  "35230": "Gold, ain't it?",
  "35231": "And, pray, who are you yourself?",
  "35232": "Is it possible for such a reason?",
  "35233": "Oh, how could we, on your money?",
  "35234": "Why should I give you courage?",
  "35235": "And how much have you got?",
  "35236": "How are you, young man?",
  "35237": "Chillip?",
  "35238": "I say, why are you so late?",
  "35239": "Will the job suit you?",
  "35240": "And who charges me with this, monseigneur?",
  "35241": "Shall I go on?",
  "35242": "Whence, now, bear ye burnished shields, harness gray and helmets grim, spears in multitude?",
  "35243": "To what do they seem to you to be like?",
  "35244": "And how stands the total?",
  "35245": "And did they not leave him on the south side of the river, with their prisoners, while they have gone foolishly on the north?",
  "35246": "Or spiders?",
  "35247": "But you receive him at your house?",
  "35248": "Was there a human agency in the matter?",
  "35249": "And what is the coachman like?",
  "35250": "Have we beheld demons?",
  "35251": "What is his religious doctrine to me, if he carries some good notions along with it?",
  "35252": "And when will that be, father?",
  "35253": "Who could have told her?",
  "35254": "That's it?",
  "35255": "How can I describe my sensations on beholding it?",
  "35256": "What can it be that has this double power?",
  "35257": "And yet you have sent for me?",
  "35258": "Why does a chicken cross the road?",
  "35259": "Who's got the job?",
  "35260": "Is she pretty?",
  "35261": "If ever you can get aboard again, says you?",
  "35262": "I don't know how I can ever make it up to you?",
  "35263": "Shall I fire my rifle off and scare him?",
  "35264": "Have you ever told a lie?",
  "35265": "If he forces us to it, they'll be producible, won't they?",
  "35266": "You have seen it on dozens of girls, and you never found out that it was pretty till now?",
  "35267": "What, the whole property there?",
  "35268": "But don't you know it is extremely wicked to do such things?",
  "35269": "Is it so important to you?",
  "35270": "What fiend possesses you to stare back at me, continually, with those infernal eyes?",
  "35271": "Even in the country do we get any rest?",
  "35272": "What is it, my friend?",
  "35273": "Why calls my friend?",
  "35274": "Were you examined at an inquest?",
  "35275": "How do they love it dressed?",
  "35276": "How can they get loose when there's a guard over them, ready to shoot them down if they move a peg?",
  "35277": "When were thy frequent pledges and still more frequent gifts believed or accepted?",
  "35278": "Your husband, then, is at last dead?",
  "35279": "Pillage?",
  "35280": "Is everyone all right?",
  "35281": "What do you say of this?",
  "35282": "And you don't know when he'll go away?",
  "35283": "Which do YOU think it was?",
  "35284": "Why is that gendarme there?",
  "35285": "Wouldn't that console you?",
  "35286": "But what are these beasts?",
  "35287": "You think your sister will come?",
  "35288": "You see him?",
  "35289": "Against the westland clans?",
  "35290": "But you won't tell him?",
  "35291": "And when will you come to see mamma?",
  "35292": "He did not happen to see our plan of fortifications, did he?",
  "35293": "You are not going out, I hope?",
  "35294": "Was he blind?",
  "35295": "Does your majesty grant me this?",
  "35296": "Where was the horse?",
  "35297": "You won't stop for dinner?",
  "35298": "Well, you'll want to make up your mind pretty soon, won't you, if we're going?",
  "35299": "When is it going to be?",
  "35300": "Do you still feel any desire to stand up in his defence?",
  "35301": "Do you know who made you?",
  "35302": "What sort of a watchman, of a checker, are you?",
  "35303": "I hoped it was true?",
  "35304": "After?",
  "35305": "Why will you not grant my last wish?",
  "35306": "Do you pay taxes to an agent that he may destroy your property?",
  "35307": "He would have to fly, and where?",
  "35308": "In a figurative sense, how far, and to what offences, may it be extended?",
  "35309": "And what do you think of him?",
  "35310": "The register of my child's birth?",
  "35311": "Was there one exception, and that one he who needed to have been most happy?",
  "35312": "Who is this maid?",
  "35313": "But what was she to do?",
  "35314": "The peasants are ruined?",
  "35315": "Who but a billionaire could say what was fair exchange for a billion?",
  "35316": "Two pounds, and you bring it back?",
  "35317": "Don't he?",
  "35318": "You love me just a little, then, marquise?",
  "35319": "Why are you virtuous?",
  "35320": "Are you far gone with a fool?",
  "35321": "Don't you remember how you used to say that we must always tell the truth?",
  "35322": "Us, won't they?",
  "35323": "How can a man conceal his character?",
  "35324": "What should I do?",
  "35325": "Is that all?",
  "35326": "Who, sire?",
  "35327": "I think I am a philosopher, perhaps, and who knows, perhaps I do wish to teach my views of things to those I meet with?",
  "35328": "Do I seem one to fear for myself?",
  "35329": "But suppose you've bitten a specky bit by accident?",
  "35330": "But where do they sleep?",
  "35331": "You have seen him, then?",
  "35332": "But, just what did the genewal tell you?",
  "35333": "There's nothing to keep you, is there?",
  "35334": "Nicholas, when when did you break your cameo?",
  "35335": "D'you remember the last time we met?",
  "35336": "What hope could there have been for him then?",
  "35337": "You have no mother?",
  "35338": "Outside of a private car?",
  "35339": "How is she ever to do better?",
  "35340": "You had heard that there was an execution in the house?",
  "35341": "Can you see where he has put his rifle or his bow?",
  "35342": "But who the deuce is he following?",
  "35343": "Are not necessary pleasures those of which we cannot get rid, and of which the satisfaction is a benefit to us?",
  "35344": "Can they understand or explain even their own characters?",
  "35345": "And why so?",
  "35346": "Is he a good doctor, my love?",
  "35347": "And where is your lodging?",
  "35348": "You won't be quite at the other end of the world, will you?",
  "35349": "I hope, my dear friend, you will carry out your father's wish?",
  "35350": "You have knocked at all doors?",
  "35351": "Wouldn't it give a mighty big bump to her subconscious self, or whatever the jargon is, and start it functioning again right away?",
  "35352": "Old man, how goes?",
  "35353": "But what could he have to do with this old family custom of ours, and what does this rigmarole mean?",
  "35354": "Will you take my arm, sir?",
  "35355": "Is it in my character?",
  "35356": "Uncle, what wood is this?",
  "35357": "Well, what did he say then?",
  "35358": "There they were, the words, and what did she want more?",
  "35359": "What does he desire of me?",
  "35360": "Are you like all the rest?",
  "35361": "How dare you grin at me like that?",
  "35362": "Who will make me that summons?",
  "35363": "Especially with copper toes?",
  "35364": "Was it the effect of the lunar rays?",
  "35365": "What have you said?",
  "35366": "You never find he slights his work when your back is turned?",
  "35367": "Perhaps you would like to pay interest?",
  "35368": "Which is she?",
  "35369": "Is that any reason why we should propose to preserve it for ever in a condition of tutelage?",
  "35370": "And my walking up and down for three hours from the table to the stove?",
  "35371": "Not chops?",
  "35372": "Isn't she a clever thing?",
  "35373": "Would he choose the peers, for example?",
  "35374": "Why, how are you?",
  "35375": "Who persuaded them into letting him see if he could drive?",
  "35376": "Do you think you can behead me with a single blow?",
  "35377": "For whence does everything come?",
  "35378": "Where is the letter?",
  "35379": "Poor old who?",
  "35380": "And this stutterer, won't he turn out a murderer?",
  "35381": "Me?",
  "35382": "Do you know this person?",
  "35383": "But you didn't have much to do with him, did you?",
  "35384": "What WILL he do, then?",
  "35385": "Where do you expect to get to?",
  "35386": "Your birthday?",
  "35387": "What have your family got to do with it?",
  "35388": "How much do I get?",
  "35389": "But may he not change and transform himself?",
  "35390": "It is not so?",
  "35391": "Then I shall really have them?",
  "35392": "So you go back from your promise?",
  "35393": "May she?",
  "35394": "Do you remember what I said when you asked me what I should do if I won all the pots I set my heart on and came through alive?",
  "35395": "Is it too great?",
  "35396": "At it again, hey?",
  "35397": "Which was it?",
  "35398": "Then why don't you send this new cove?",
  "35399": "Do you believe in presentiments and superstitions?",
  "35400": "Are you now satisfied?",
  "35401": "Your success too?",
  "35402": "The bandits whom the abbe keeps in pay and drink have their useful side, have they?",
  "35403": "Can a man who listens to these three counsellors be sure that he is right in a given decision?",
  "35404": "Have we not perfectly understood each other?",
  "35405": "There is a good postal service, I suppose?",
  "35406": "Comes it in there?",
  "35407": "Tell us now, at once, what you made of the present?",
  "35408": "What is popular sovereignty?",
  "35409": "Do you think we are sure to come out of the wilderness?",
  "35410": "How hang your pouches?",
  "35411": "Should you like to be her boatman?",
  "35412": "How did I survive and surmount such wounds?",
  "35413": "How often we sin, how much we deceive, and all for what?",
  "35414": "Will soon what?",
  "35415": "Know you anything of your own family at that time?",
  "35416": "And from a noble client?",
  "35417": "So that, in fact, you have never learned or heard anything in particular?",
  "35418": "Marquise, whence do you come?",
  "35419": "What was said or done?",
  "35420": "And where will your worship drink?",
  "35421": "How is it that you have no friends in your prosperity when you had many in adversity?",
  "35422": "King's attorney?",
  "35423": "What could they think indeed?",
  "35424": "HERE?",
  "35425": "If he were in love with the lady?",
  "35426": "Why does she come so close?",
  "35427": "And will he be the better for that?",
  "35428": "What's the matter with your nose, there?",
  "35429": "Now I ax what have they to show for their three months' setting?",
  "35430": "Cherries?",
  "35431": "How are we to know them if we do find them?",
  "35432": "What about the other girl, the one you decoyed away over a week ago?",
  "35433": "How could she not be happy?",
  "35434": "It has been a delightful evening, has it not?",
  "35435": "And now, doctor, what are we to do about money?",
  "35436": "Had they not searched exactly where the document stated?",
  "35437": "How you like it, hey, ole sport?",
  "35438": "But what human language can adequately portray that astonishment, that horror which possessed me at the spectacle then presented to view?",
  "35439": "How came the woman's ring there?",
  "35440": "At best, might not a man in the water lose all his power of direction, and so move in an endless circle until he sank exhausted?",
  "35441": "Does his wife know of it?",
  "35442": "And what is the solar heat?",
  "35443": "If any one were to come in, my dear boy?",
  "35444": "Has your grace taken the precaution to come out in a good stout pair of boots?",
  "35445": "Whet, whoiver knew yah wur coming?",
  "35446": "Where would you wish to go?",
  "35447": "What tidings of the foe?",
  "35448": "Why do I think of her as dressed in green?",
  "35449": "Was that all a human being amounted to?",
  "35450": "But you would not advise me to refuse?",
  "35451": "And so much to my honour too?",
  "35452": "And why look there?",
  "35453": "And have you no mind of my weight of passion, and the holy dispensation, and the drift of heifers I am giving, and the golden ring?",
  "35454": "Did you know her?",
  "35455": "And do you not know, I said, that all mere opinions are bad, and the best of them blind?",
  "35456": "But you're not going away?",
  "35457": "I forgive you?",
  "35458": "What do I care?",
  "35459": "I say, you are not jealous, are you?",
  "35460": "Where is he wounded?",
  "35461": "But what is to be the object of this capricious partiality in the national councils?",
  "35462": "The one in the dark blue coat?",
  "35463": "Want any?",
  "35464": "But why?",
  "35465": "If you come to that, it's hardly my place to be flung out of the flat like this and have to go to an hotel, what?",
  "35466": "Will you open, yes or no?",
  "35467": "Isn't that it?",
  "35468": "If so, on what does your constitution rest?",
  "35469": "With whom?",
  "35470": "What were you doing up there?",
  "35471": "Can you have forgotten your oath?",
  "35472": "What convicts?",
  "35473": "What are we waiting for now?",
  "35474": "And how much is the tax?",
  "35475": "Now, what did you gather from that woman's appearance?",
  "35476": "Why is it you can do nothing?",
  "35477": "Do you want to know if I am telling the truth?",
  "35478": "What a state of society is this for a free country?",
  "35479": "But won't this density augment?",
  "35480": "Was it in the afternoon?",
  "35481": "Do you want me to explain what that is?",
  "35482": "A stealthy footstep on the stairs?",
  "35483": "Is this a fairy country?",
  "35484": "Is it a thing, or is it a name, or is it a fraud?",
  "35485": "Can you come with me?",
  "35486": "Did you see by the paper they are going to call out the militia?",
  "35487": "Do the footmen kiss her?",
  "35488": "But why does she lie on a sofa?",
  "35489": "And you understand that language, don't you?",
  "35490": "What answer was sent?",
  "35491": "What, billing, exchanging stolen glances and broken murmurs?",
  "35492": "But what's this?",
  "35493": "What vapour is that?",
  "35494": "Look at that medder, beant it lovely?",
  "35495": "Who would undertake to feed such an enormous multitude?",
  "35496": "By the way, would you mind lending me your matches?",
  "35497": "How could she, a woman, not yet bereft of youth or charms, live alone in the forest, among a troop of soldiers?",
  "35498": "Could he expect that her friends would not step forward?",
  "35499": "Where's my cousin?",
  "35500": "What's the price?",
  "35501": "Fur lined?",
  "35502": "What are they to do?",
  "35503": "Why, how can it be just to beat a father?",
  "35504": "What, are you crossing of yourself?",
  "35505": "You now understand the place, don't you?",
  "35506": "But are you not afraid to leave the horse in his power now, since he has every interest in injuring it?",
  "35507": "Why did you come, then?",
  "35508": "What was the abbe's name?",
  "35509": "Never see you again?",
  "35510": "Would the lock click at the end of those seemingly interminable intervals of time?",
  "35511": "Comes he not?",
  "35512": "Why am I left here alone?",
  "35513": "Do you mean to say you think we are going to have bad weather?",
  "35514": "Then you didn't see the cobs?",
  "35515": "Why were these prisoners not disarmed?",
  "35516": "Why is there this difference?",
  "35517": "You must surely also have been married?",
  "35518": "Why did not he attack at once?",
  "35519": "Were the shutters closed?",
  "35520": "Camels?",
  "35521": "What are you afraid of, prince?",
  "35522": "What more COULD it be?",
  "35523": "Doesn't tha' know?",
  "35524": "Carmarthen?",
  "35525": "Cannot we do anything to put an end to it?",
  "35526": "Do you find me of sufficient rank to do me the honor of crossing swords with me?",
  "35527": "And what shall I say of his virtues?",
  "35528": "What can you expect?",
  "35529": "Are you a patriot?",
  "35530": "'Tis so well known here, is it, comrade?",
  "35531": "Why don't you show us your foot quietly?",
  "35532": "Whom do you speak of?",
  "35533": "You will write to her in a day or two?",
  "35534": "Ha, lady?",
  "35535": "Do you want to be let in?",
  "35536": "Was it her character, or her mind, or her nature?",
  "35537": "What is the matter, love?",
  "35538": "What could he be looking for on that immense expanse?",
  "35539": "And how the deuce could I, even if I knew every girl in the place?",
  "35540": "But would she pass on, or would she put into port?",
  "35541": "You looked into the cellars?",
  "35542": "How could you be so rude, so mean, and cruel to us both?",
  "35543": "Was not the selection of the male guardians determined by differences of this sort?",
  "35544": "Why, who do you think this is?",
  "35545": "Is that his design in settling here?",
  "35546": "You teach in it yourself?",
  "35547": "But how did it originate?",
  "35548": "What in the world, between them, ever took place?",
  "35549": "Where does the needle and thread come from?",
  "35550": "But what was that?",
  "35551": "Do you not think that, in putting it as you have done, you have been unjust?",
  "35552": "Do you wish to assassinate a man who, in the eyes of heaven, is a brother?",
  "35553": "Did she know where her husband was?",
  "35554": "Then you'll go?",
  "35555": "Under the bed, are you, hussy?",
  "35556": "Have no society, no neighbors?",
  "35557": "And if I do my duty and do right, you will sustain me, will you not?",
  "35558": "Perhaps he condoles with me, does he?",
  "35559": "Who are these builded for, my son?",
  "35560": "Affords this art no greater miracle?",
  "35561": "Well, then, what do you propose to do?",
  "35562": "You saw the lady fall?",
  "35563": "Do you think as it could be a rabbit?",
  "35564": "But how did you get to work again?",
  "35565": "Would it not, moreover, be much more easy for him to gain his daughter, if he did all in his power to forward his father's views?",
  "35566": "What man could be more lovable than such a man as would grow from such a boy?",
  "35567": "Why should not we also enjoy an original relation to the universe?",
  "35568": "Are you thinking I'm safe?",
  "35569": "Well, what of it?",
  "35570": "What's he up to now, I wonder?",
  "35571": "What do you keep on doing it for?",
  "35572": "Did you receive the despatch?",
  "35573": "He is living?",
  "35574": "Shall I really tell you?",
  "35575": "What will our friends think of us, who may chance to be upon the street and witness our frivolous antics?",
  "35576": "Or a subjugator?",
  "35577": "How long have you been married?",
  "35578": "Yet who is there does not sometimes hazard it for the enjoyment of an hour?",
  "35579": "Now for what, my dear friend?",
  "35580": "You will promise me that, at any rate?",
  "35581": "What was their languid grace but the softness of chambering?",
  "35582": "Could I count them on my fingers?",
  "35583": "May I come in?",
  "35584": "'Twould mean that I agree, wouldn't it?",
  "35585": "Don't you think it's pleasanter out in the veranda?",
  "35586": "Are you for the rich or for the poor?",
  "35587": "Whose is he?",
  "35588": "Who has been telling you about him?",
  "35589": "Have you nothing else to tell him?",
  "35590": "Worse?",
  "35591": "What would the best of us be if he were suddenly placed at war with the whole world?",
  "35592": "Who is your man?",
  "35593": "Where is he now?",
  "35594": "What are you bothering for?",
  "35595": "Do you seek any guidance from me?",
  "35596": "How on earth should she talk of any one else as long as you are here?",
  "35597": "And a narrative it remains both in the speeches which the poet recites from time to time and in the intermediate passages?",
  "35598": "And others say even that the external world is the work of our organs?",
  "35599": "Am I sorry?",
  "35600": "And, indeed, unless this shoal had a machine in its stomach, how could it change its position with such astonishing rapidity?",
  "35601": "Could the prisoners see each other?",
  "35602": "But why do you ask?",
  "35603": "Ar'n't you coming with me, dearest?",
  "35604": "Are you quite sure, then, that you WILL come to see him often?",
  "35605": "Till then, will you be one, sir?",
  "35606": "And will you undertake to deliver it?",
  "35607": "Well, did you like it?",
  "35608": "Where is my aunt?",
  "35609": "You are horrified?",

  "36008": "Will you fight me?",
  "36009": "What do you suppose he meant?",
  "36010": "Do you love me still?",
  "36011": "Which is the way out, please?",
  "36012": "Now, what's your name?",
  "36013": "How can it, by coming quickly into the eyes and ears, distinguish the pleasing from the disgusting in external objects?",
  "36014": "You love it, do you?",
  "36015": "And, yet, how could it be otherwise?",
  "36016": "Why had this agent preserved silence?",
  "36017": "They include, I presume, correspondence?",
  "36018": "How can you not know?",
  "36019": "Who of any dignity would take the trouble to clear cobwebs from a wild man's mind after such language as this?",
  "36020": "But how came he to be there?",
  "36021": "Do you wish to destroy me?",
  "36022": "Don't you think that rather too late?",
  "36023": "And he who is most skilful in preventing or escaping from a disease is best able to create one?",
  "36024": "What remained to her of primitive virtue?",
  "36025": "This, sir?",
  "36026": "Jo, dear, what is it?",
  "36027": "How would you like to have some tableaux in here?",
  "36028": "With this boy?",
  "36029": "Do you know who I am?",
  "36030": "When I spoke in confidence to your brother, could I regard him as an inquisitor?",
  "36031": "Did you court her for her wealth?",
  "36032": "Have I met you and passed you already, unknowing, unthinking and blind?",
  "36033": "You are acquainted?",
  "36034": "But what would be the use of new continents?",
  "36035": "Have I kept my promise, yes or no?",
  "36036": "There used to be a certain amount of solidity in all things, but now what happens?",
  "36037": "Because I love the court?",
  "36038": "Can one ever tell anyone what one is feeling?",
  "36039": "When the company was gone, my master asked my father, if he smoked?",
  "36040": "Who knows how easy it is for ambition to call itself vocation?",
  "36041": "Was it my mother's or my father's act?",
  "36042": "Is this a carelessness, or what?",
  "36043": "Weak?",
  "36044": "Aren't you ashamed of yourself, a husky young chap like you in mufti when men are needed in the trenches?",
  "36045": "Might they not hang him at once, and inquire into his case afterward?",
  "36046": "What do they say?",
  "36047": "Had she really any life of her own behind all her propagandism?",
  "36048": "Do you think this would be the first time a woman had repented of an infidelity?",
  "36049": "Do you think our little girl here need be afraid?",
  "36050": "Can you tell me why you foster the cruel deception?",
  "36051": "What else has the world given me for all that I have done for it?",
  "36052": "And what good will it do you?",
  "36053": "The servants can't miss the way?",
  "36054": "Why joke?",
  "36055": "What is he like, uncle?",
  "36056": "And is not the truest pity, when a man has a sore point, not to touch it at all?",
  "36057": "But you couldn't see what they were like, in the dark, lad, I suppose?",
  "36058": "Are you satisfied?",
  "36059": "Who would hear her?",
  "36060": "Do you not see that they are all giving me the wink, and wanting me to turn you out by force, only I do not like to do so?",
  "36061": "What's the good of asking yourself if you know you don't know?",
  "36062": "And are you glad to see me?",
  "36063": "And what is the pay?",
  "36064": "Has he now some disciples?",
  "36065": "To sleep?",
  "36066": "What'll it be?",
  "36067": "But a little rakish, hey?",
  "36068": "With friends like that, who needs enemies?",
  "36069": "A bride?",
  "36070": "Or what is become of them?",
  "36071": "Is he indeed, sir?",
  "36072": "He will not talk to me about it, so why should I trouble him?",
  "36073": "But is not your eminence going to the queen?",
  "36074": "At once?",
  "36075": "Will it be long first?",
  "36076": "Don't you see what I mean?",
  "36077": "But am I sure?",
  "36078": "Rita?",
  "36079": "Who took that step?",
  "36080": "What's better in him?",
  "36081": "But why should I make a long story?",
  "36082": "If error is possible there, why not here?",
  "36083": "Nothing else?",
  "36084": "You say 'What are they regarding?",
  "36085": "Have you not left off your impudent pretensions there yet?",
  "36086": "That is all true, then, is it?",
  "36087": "Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary clothes on?",
  "36088": "May we see it now?",
  "36089": "What's to be done?",
  "36090": "Was he the only applicant?",
  "36091": "A man who has paid every penalty for wrong, if wrong there was?",
  "36092": "You surely will not do that, my dear count?",
  "36093": "What did this mean?",
  "36094": "What mysterious thing can this be?",
  "36095": "Well, sir, what is it?",
  "36096": "In what place, captain?",
  "36097": "Then where are the other people?",
  "36098": "Very bad, eh?",
  "36099": "What do you think of this?",
  "36100": "Where is your justification for inflicting all this pain?",
  "36101": "Why should we consider ourselves, men and women, as broken fragments of one whole?",
  "36102": "Then, is she dying?",
  "36103": "Are you all right now?",
  "36104": "Where've you hid your letters?",
  "36105": "What is the matter with her?",
  "36106": "And what favor, pray?",
  "36107": "What do you want to have me here for?",
  "36108": "What mad pursuit?",
  "36109": "Why not?",
  "36110": "But what would you have me do, child?",
  "36111": "Had she tried her strength again, what had that availed?",
  "36112": "Do you hear what I say?",
  "36113": "Of what complexion?",
  "36114": "Is she to be shown up to your room?",
  "36115": "And, if I said so, to whom would the place belong?",
  "36116": "Is no one about who can get in?",
  "36117": "You called me, didn't you?",
  "36118": "Will you have brilliants, or a castle by the sea, or, perhaps, a yacht?",
  "36119": "Do they follow us so far?",
  "36120": "But even if one might, what feeling except veneration could such a man as my father evoke?",
  "36121": "Who will give it to me?",
  "36122": "Who is so bold as to do it?",
  "36123": "Why did you come here to find me, then?",
  "36124": "English?",
  "36125": "Vot is de reason a big man like you has got only a dollar und a quarter?",
  "36126": "Can I be always by your side?",
  "36127": "Auntie, what have I done?",
  "36128": "Where's your shells?",
  "36129": "Is it your business, eh?",
  "36130": "Do you see that island?",
  "36131": "You think that she would refuse me?",
  "36132": "Did you sleep badly?",
  "36133": "Is it because we are invited?",
  "36134": "Will you walk a little bit with me?",
  "36135": "Do you deny that you were listening at that door?",
  "36136": "How soon may we hope to get back?",
  "36137": "Is the wind north or south?",
  "36138": "Yet how could he think her capable of deliberately wishing to renew their assignations now?",
  "36139": "Aluminum?",
  "36140": "How could it have been me?",
  "36141": "What makes you say that?",
  "36142": "And who will be the warden of the hospital?",
  "36143": "Is this the man that is to raise a breeze in his favor by abusing lawyers?",
  "36144": "What's that that has fallen?",
  "36145": "Has judgment been pronounced?",
  "36146": "And who is the criminal?",
  "36147": "Can you row?",
  "36148": "Can he spare you?",
  "36149": "Shall we ever know?",
  "36150": "But who the devil has fortified this paltry little place in this manner?",
  "36151": "Do you remember any case at all like it?",
  "36152": "What am I to do now?",
  "36153": "Won't it be lovely to go home in the dark?",
  "36154": "Isn't it a beauty?",
  "36155": "About me?",
  "36156": "Brooke?",
  "36157": "Is it funny?",
  "36158": "But if so, where was the girl, and what had she done with the papers?",
  "36159": "And you did not know any one else on the train?",
  "36160": "You, a man already endowed with a man's discretion?",
  "36161": "You intend to remain?",
  "36162": "No guarantee?",
  "36163": "Are you asking for a lodger?",
  "36164": "And if it knew, would it dare?",
  "36165": "And what do you call that little metal ruler?",
  "36166": "What is advantage?",
  "36167": "You are not going, papa?",
  "36168": "Is that what you have been trying?",
  "36169": "My little woman, why do you look at me in that way?",
  "36170": "What do you want to say?",
  "36171": "Is yours a long part?",
  "36172": "Gentle?",
  "36173": "What is POLITICS?",
  "36174": "What did their tears imply?",
  "36175": "What shall the court do?",
  "36176": "But what do YOU think?",
  "36177": "If he had not lost his balance, why should he have launched into an almost passionate defence of the physical coward?",
  "36178": "What is the object of these questions?",
  "36179": "Oh you're there, are you?",
  "36180": "How much may it amount to?",
  "36181": "Shall I tell him all, then, openly?",
  "36182": "Oswald, have you not your mother to come to the rescue?",
  "36183": "O, do you know me, man?",
  "36184": "And how do you get on with the officers?",
  "36185": "How dare you come when you're not wanted?",
  "36186": "Whence was consciousness awakened?",
  "36187": "Is it certainly accursed?",
  "36188": "But to do this he must have spoken?",
  "36189": "Have you ever died yet?",
  "36190": "Who would ever suspect me, me, me, especially if I should choose a being I had no interest in doing away with?",
  "36191": "Trust to the sword the fortunes of the world?",
  "36192": "Where is your crown, then?",
  "36193": "And even if there's a delay, how can it alter the end?",
  "36194": "It will not be opened when the hearing is resumed?",
  "36195": "Then what does he do?",
  "36196": "Have the rebels been successful up to this time?",
  "36197": "You saw this?",
  "36198": "Whom choose ye for master?",
  "36199": "You want a serious duel?",
  "36200": "Are not your people dead?",
  "36201": "Will you lose by him, then?",
  "36202": "Kenneth?",
  "36203": "Who could have taken it out?",
  "36204": "Haven't you had enough of starvation yet?",
  "36205": "You don't like the idea of being a milestone?",
  "36206": "Your little share?",
  "36207": "Are you hurt?",
  "36208": "And why be at the charge of providing logic of the best quality, when a very inferior article will be equally acceptable?",
  "36209": "Or rather at what he said?",
  "36210": "Then in what do you intend to be married, unnatural girl?",
  "36211": "Have you nearly concluded your argument?",
  "36212": "What, in short, is his character?",
  "36213": "What's the matter?",
  "36214": "And you don't want to know how I got here?",
  "36215": "Where can she have come from?",
  "36216": "What's his trade?",
  "36217": "Yet why not?",
  "36218": "Does he not perceive us?",
  "36219": "Has she?",
  "36220": "Who is entitled to the rent of the land?",
  "36221": "Would it not be wise for us to make a change?",
  "36222": "How might he be more brave?",
  "36223": "As, indeed, how should any of those prim and reputable virgins?",
  "36224": "What was that noise about?",
  "36225": "Have you watched?",
  "36226": "Twas shameful, was it not?",
  "36227": "Or is it only because you must?",
  "36228": "Had a bath this morning?",
  "36229": "What shall I say or do?",
  "36230": "Are you then pressed for this money?",
  "36231": "Mightn't one, to reach his mind, risk the stretch of an angular arm over his character?",
  "36232": "What's that you got?",
  "36233": "Pardon this rascal?",
  "36234": "The sound of the spur?",
  "36235": "Not a civil list?",
  "36236": "Now you laugh?",
  "36237": "And is this true of all opposites?",
  "36238": "Then you did come 'to fight,' I may conclude?",
  "36239": "She is a living creature, why should she stand anything, just because you choose to make her?",
  "36240": "A minister?",
  "36241": "Who am I?",
  "36242": "Are there many descends between here and the place whither you are going?",
  "36243": "What have we all done, then, dear grandpapa?",
  "36244": "Is anybody suspected?",
  "36245": "The exact sum?",
  "36246": "I JUSTICE, WHETHER A NATURAL OR ARTIFICIAL VIRTUE?",
  "36247": "My commands?",
  "36248": "Or rather do I not wrong those whom I ought least to wrong?",
  "36249": "Which is best, to draw from nature or from the antique?",
  "36250": "Is he not much handsomer and better built than that great chucklehead?",
  "36251": "Or any greater good than the bond of unity?",
  "36252": "What now could he do for his boy except die?",
  "36253": "And if that's the case, what do they mean by wanting me to believe that he is enchanted?",
  "36254": "It must be pretty bad, mustn't it?",
  "36255": "What are you saying about the militia?",
  "36256": "A horse and two men?",
  "36257": "You will say nothing to me?",
  "36258": "Looking after your niece when you're dead and gone, and getting a husband for her, eh?",
  "36259": "Will you give me the first son you have?",
  "36260": "Ah, is it you, baron?",
  "36261": "Jeanette?",
  "36262": "How did you get out of it?",
  "36263": "What would you recommend me to READ?",
  "36264": "When did she first hear of it?",
  "36265": "How do you know she has not seen them?",
  "36266": "You're living, aren't you?",
  "36267": "Have you brought me any more?",
  "36268": "Have you heard any bad news?",
  "36269": "Where had she been during that strange expedition?",
  "36270": "You will, won't you?",
  "36271": "But what is the meaning of all these soldiers everywhere?",
  "36272": "Was that a work for your hands?",
  "36273": "But how does that knowledge help us?",
  "36274": "Did they know her?",
  "36275": "Might not the philosopher elevate himself above faith in grammar?",
  "36276": "Where was the ceremony performed?",
  "36277": "Who is he?",
  "36278": "What is it to me, who have passed twenty years between life and death?",
  "36279": "You do not fear, I imagine, that these gentlemen could stave in walls on which the balls of your frigate have had no effect?",
  "36280": "That little log house where there was a pile of pumpkins in the yard?",
  "36281": "Did she now?",
  "36282": "Where is everybody?",
  "36283": "But how?",
  "36284": "What's verdigrease?",
  "36285": "But the general and his succor?",
  "36286": "But if you knew all this why didn't you get out before?",
  "36287": "Is the poor gentleman much hurt?",
  "36288": "But what made them let us go?",
  "36289": "What is dreadful?",
  "36290": "And who are these others?",
  "36291": "You know what awaits you, then?",
  "36292": "Then the tyrant is removed from true pleasure by the space of a number which is three times three?",
  "36293": "You must love somebody?",
  "36294": "The last load, eh?",
  "36295": "If you lecture in the schools do you not go to whoever pays you most?",
  "36296": "Where was the sun?",
  "36297": "And what stands in their way?",
  "36298": "What have you got to tell me?",
  "36299": "And are always a getting stronger, old chap?",
  "36300": "Does he really mean to marry me?",
  "36301": "Is it indeed true that we have heretofore refrained from doing so merely from the degrading motive of a conscious weakness?",
  "36302": "Will you see him?",
  "36303": "Well, how do you stand affected towards your lady?",
  "36304": "And what is her history?",
  "36305": "Yes or no?",
  "36306": "I hope you will be there?",
  "36307": "What use would he make of the power now?",
  "36308": "Are we really going to be walking around the moon inside of thirty minutes?",
  "36309": "Why do you speak of a housemaid so contemptuously?",
  "36310": "You surely do not suppose that I have nothing better to do than to study such publications as these?",
  "36311": "Will you move quickly?",
  "36312": "What SHOULD they get out of him?",
  "36313": "You are not wounded, I hope?",
  "36314": "He will grow more and more indolent and careless?",
  "36315": "Is that very embarrassing?",
  "36316": "Won't you smoke?",
  "36317": "What will he like him to be called?",
  "36318": "What do you wish me to do?",
  "36319": "Honest man, could not you throw me ashore?",
  "36320": "Who is not a cannibal?",
  "36321": "What other course was left for us to pursue?",
  "36322": "Was that the case, said he, truly, and from your heart?",
  "36323": "Shall you be happy if I do what you wish?",
  "36324": "Whose manner, child?",
  "36325": "What were you doing behind the curtain?",
  "36326": "Do you know where it is to be found?",
  "36327": "And therefore a soul which is absolutely a soul has no vice?",
  "36328": "Then in every way the laws will help the citizens to keep the peace with one another?",
  "36329": "What does that mean, romantic?",
  "36330": "Could it?",
  "36331": "Those charming meetings?",
  "36332": "Why should they be, when we will win them back?",
  "36333": "And did it hurt much?",
  "36334": "Do you hear the cracking?",
  "36335": "And who shall silence all the airs and madrigals that whisper softness in chambers?",
  "36336": "Ought I before giving him the slap to say a few words by way of preface?",
  "36337": "And is it settled?",
  "36338": "Where do you get your information from?",
  "36339": "Are you warm, darling?",
  "36340": "What officers?",
  "36341": "Do you intend parting with the little ones, madam?",
  "36342": "But the mark in your hand?",
  "36343": "What d'you say to spending the evening together?",
  "36344": "What right have we human beings to happiness?",

  "36348": "What are you trying to suggest?",
  "36349": "So I see, but does it follow that he is your property?",
  "36350": "How dare you stay here when you heard me call?",
  "36351": "But what guarantee have I?",
  "36352": "And why should one ask for advice, who does not expect to gain his health?",
  "36353": "What did you say your name was?",
  "36354": "Who are you?",
  "36355": "Do we?",
  "36356": "What do you mean, sir?",
  "36357": "What else could I think?",
  "36358": "But ask not, to what doctors I apply?",
  "36359": "But does he care for her?",
  "36360": "Are you sure you're well enough?",
  "36361": "What assures me, sir?",
  "36362": "What harm, then, could a man do in the moat?",
  "36363": "Smallweed?",
  "36364": "Does not your heart feel that they imply great earnestness in life?",
  "36365": "Do you ever dream of me?",
  "36366": "Why should you wish to force me to do what I'll willingly do of myself?",
  "36367": "Do you think people, if they had received no injury, would come such a journey only to calumniate your father?",
  "36368": "And do you know how pretty you are, child?",
  "36369": "You are sure of that?",
  "36370": "Why did the five fellows out of the higher line run away for that?",
  "36371": "Was this not indeed a veritable hell, peopled by lost souls, dead and damned beyond all hope?",
  "36372": "Has your chief come down yet?",
  "36373": "Oh, suppose we did, and had to stay out all night?",
  "36374": "A young man?",
  "36375": "Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught?",
  "36376": "Whose prisoner was she?",
  "36377": "Aren't you ashamed now?",
  "36378": "Anything more, sir?",
  "36379": "He can't have found a fox trail, can he?",
  "36380": "It looks like it, doesn't it?",
  "36381": "You don't mean to set up for a new character with ME after all these years, I hope?",
  "36382": "Who can have robbed it of the beauty that gladdened it, of the grace and gaiety that charmed it, of the modesty that shed a lustre upon it?",
  "36383": "But you be glad that you 'm going to marry a gentleman?",
  "36384": "And indeed what does the price matter, if the trick be well done?",
  "36385": "Confound you, have you been rummaging round among my clothes, then?",
  "36386": "Is it wrong to see the beauty of the almond blossoms, wrong to taste the scented wind?",
  "36387": "Do you know how long it would take for an express train to reach the moon?",
  "36388": "Will you tell me how long you have loved him?",
  "36389": "It's breakfast you want, is it?",
  "36390": "You saw the ventilator, too?",
  "36391": "Then you never believed in the principality?",
  "36392": "And is not my brother dead?",
  "36393": "Where is the green door?",
  "36394": "So now we are friends again, are we not?",
  "36395": "Will you three months hence be in a situation to perform the journey more at your ease than at present?",
  "36396": "But is that case could I have expected more from him than from my own brother?",
  "36397": "You say that I am safe and sound?",
  "36398": "How can one think of him as bad?",
  "36399": "How much might that be?",
  "36400": "Is not 'loves' the truer tense?",
  "36401": "Will I not guard, and cherish, and solace her?",
  "36402": "Why did he hesitate?",
  "36403": "You had my note?",
  "36404": "What sorrows?",
  "36405": "The seen is the changing, and the unseen is the unchanging?",
  "36406": "Hope?",

  "36416": "Why to a poor one most?",
  "36417": "And why would you be so fond to overcome the famous wrestler?",
  "36418": "Will you write a book?",
  "36419": "Was it some incident, some sorrow, that led you to take life vows?",
  "36420": "Are you there?",

  "36429": "You don't mind, do you?",
  "36430": "Do you suppose I want to be told where to go?",
  "36431": "Just you and the river, and no one else to pass a word with?",
  "36432": "But did there not exist in the island some animal which might supply the place of the horse, ass, or ox?",
  "36433": "Shall I?",
  "36434": "Did she speak of the man?",
  "36435": "What was to be done?",
  "36436": "You do not care if he does?",
  "36437": "Who was the unknown companion of her dream?",
  "36438": "And what a devil is become of them?",
  "36439": "I wonder whether you remember what I said to you then?",
  "36440": "Did you never hear that from the young girls where you come from in the west or south?",
  "36441": "The night porter saw nothing, I suppose?",
  "36442": "For who can guess?",
  "36443": "But shan't you then so much as miss her a little?",
  "36444": "And so you think that I ought to answer your indictment as if I were in a court?",
  "36445": "What need they?",
  "36446": "Who?",
  "36447": "Regular people who get you a place?",
  "36448": "Is this a practical joke?",

  "36456": "What did he know about its value, or what did any one know?",
  "36457": "Why didn't yeh stay there?",
  "36458": "Is this second infinity intelligent also?",
  "36459": "What is the good of keeping it?",
  "36460": "And to which?",

  "36487": "Wouldn't you just love to be rich, girls?",
  "36488": "You are setting off, then?",
  "36489": "And he really succeeded?",
  "36490": "You have not heard then of what they are accused?",
  "36491": "You have a chart, haven't you?",
  "36492": "Why should he come again?",
  "36493": "What sort of a figure would he make if he escaped?",
  "36494": "Can it be possible?",
  "36495": "You don't mean to tell me you don't care about spiders?",
  "36496": "How you gwyne to git 'm?",

  "36498": "You wouldn't put yourself in opposition to the interests of your husband and child, would you?",
  "36499": "Mary, to me?",
  "36500": "And YOUR cheese, your excellency?",
  "36501": "And yet you saw how she thanked me, with her so beautiful dying eyes, her voice, too, so weak, and she kiss my rough old hand and bless me?",
  "36502": "In what respects?",
  "36503": "Had I caught her off her guard?",
  "36504": "And why does the weight know how to find it by so short a line?",
  "36505": "Can you have any difference with your father?",
  "36506": "Going away, sir?",

  "36510": "And ruined her character?",
  "36511": "Why wish to fly till you have got your wings?",
  "36512": "Pretty well?",
  "36513": "The executioner, in short?",
  "36514": "Where the deuce can they have gone?",
  "36515": "A merchant?",
  "36516": "Why don't I love you?",
  "36517": "What that you say?",
  "36518": "Does it now only exist in my memory?",
  "36519": "What can I say to him?",
  "36520": "How do I pay my rent?",
  "36521": "Which did she choose?",
  "36522": "May I ask what position she holds in your household?",
  "36523": "What right have we to say that this is the people's will?",

  "36527": "And if not, what else did she imagine?",
  "36528": "Were you not, gentlemen, both in the musketeers of the late king?",
  "36529": "How long his he been there?",
  "36530": "What is this oven for?",
  "36531": "Nay, will not such a one often rejoice more than any other in the rich show of outer apparel?",
  "36532": "What does that nonsense mean?",
  "36533": "Would the selfish and the cowardly ever lack reasons for yielding to the enemy?",
  "36534": "Is he at home now?",
  "36535": "Do you see any inconvenience in having an army at the end of a year, instead of two regiments?",
  "36536": "Forgiveness?",
  "36537": "Well, in what case is it just that the tax should take the form of a levy on polls?",
  "36538": "Are they dead or alive?",
  "36539": "Do you know anything of it, fellow?",
  "36540": "What preservation can you now desire after the destruction of your temple?",

  "36542": "And what she said to you?",
  "36543": "Did you want a coffin, sir?",
  "36544": "Did you ever suppose you'd see the day when you'd be adopting an orphan girl?",
  "36545": "I wonder if this can be the person we're looking for?",
  "36546": "First, then, they resemble one another in the value which they set upon wealth?",
  "36547": "What did he repeat to us all the day?",
  "36548": "What are you saying to her?",
  "36549": "You're dancing, are you?",
  "36550": "Hate you, sir?",
  "36551": "Would you know him again?",
  "36552": "If I consent to announce you, may I at least know whom to announce, monsieur?",
  "36553": "What's wrong with my face?",
  "36554": "Had that begun in your time?",
  "36555": "Never been there?",
  "36556": "Is he not in love?",
  "36557": "What did she answer?",
  "36558": "Do you dare to say that I am not right?",
  "36559": "You don't know that?",
  "36560": "What are the facts?",
  "36561": "Somebody has called?",
  "36562": "What use will peace be when he is no longer here?",
  "36563": "The inhabitants of the island and the sailors?",
  "36564": "You've got a mark upon you somewheres or another, I suppose?",
  "36565": "Where are all the listeners and spies who accompany the queen?",
  "36566": "What is this gnawing of conscience I am feeling now?",
  "36567": "What, are they gone, sirs?",
  "36568": "Whom the deuce can it be from?",
  "36569": "You didn't see her in there, did you?",
  "36570": "Need there now be any secrets between us?",
  "36571": "Was not he sent for?",
  "36572": "When was it received?",
  "36573": "But why on earth should you be pursued with such animosity?",
  "36574": "Didn't he tell you?",
  "36575": "Further, there can be no doubt that a work is spoilt when not done at the right time?",
  "36576": "What is it in your hand?",
  "36577": "What arrangement, squire?",
  "36578": "Whence did it come?",
  "36579": "Do you remember that I paid it you ten days later, and you put it at the bottom of the tobacco?",
  "36580": "Did he mention the precise order of occupation to which he would addict himself?",
  "36581": "But be seated, and tell us now what is the cause of your docility?",
  "36582": "What the devil right have you to interfere?",
  "36583": "Has he decided to do so?",
  "36584": "And with how many fingers does he bless?",
  "36585": "Do you think I cannot see?",
  "36586": "If I preserve my purity in the society of the trees, why should he who would have me preserve it among men, seek to rob me of it?",
  "36587": "What had happened to bring this shocking change about?",
  "36588": "DID you see all the diamonds those ladies wore?",
  "36589": "How is that?",
  "36590": "With that?",
  "36591": "Did you recognize?",
  "36592": "What have we done, what has this poor thing done, that we are so sore beset?",
  "36593": "Must hate and death return?",
  "36594": "Why not view it often by faith?",
  "36595": "They are not fit for me, are they?",
  "36596": "Any lazy idle loafers that want flogging in this class?",
  "36597": "Why, then, do I not hear them?",
  "36598": "Do you accept my solution of the mystery?",
  "36599": "Not one year, madame?",
  "36600": "Was it right or wrong?",
  "36601": "Have you understood how our dog was so strangely thrown up out of the water of the lake, after his struggle with the dugong?",
  "36602": "How have you defended me?",
  "36603": "What are their sufferings?",
  "36604": "How about the widows and orphans confided to you?",
  "36605": "What have you got to do with the dew, ma'am?",
  "36606": "Is life to be purchased by such a sacrifice?",
  "36607": "What tell you me of fasting days?",
  "36608": "And have the children looked after themselves at all, sir?",
  "36609": "A dress for you, also, is it not, my friend?",
  "36610": "Coavinses?",
  "36611": "Had we a river, a lake, a sea to depend upon?",
  "36612": "But nobody possesses it, so what would you have?",
  "36613": "You have made it up?",
  "36614": "When is it to be done?",
  "36615": "How, then, could they provide for themselves, and when had they time to plough and sow their fields?",
  "36616": "Was her husband, to whom it legally belonged, to make it over to her as a free gift?",
  "36617": "Is what you hear at church, religion?",
  "36618": "And what enlargement do you expect to obtain in this way?",
  "36619": "Plans?",
  "36620": "What might be the consequences?",
  "36621": "Aren't you going to save those six monkeys who are giant soldiers?",
  "36622": "Would she have pitied him had she seen him?",
  "36623": "Aronnax?",
  "36624": "In your own heart, do you feel quite certain?",
  "36625": "But won't they know we're not?",
  "36626": "Or you, my lords, to be my followers?",
  "36627": "It is true?",
  "36628": "Then in time of peace justice will be of no use?",
  "36629": "But how could you guess what the motive was?",
  "36630": "What did you think of that?",
  "36631": "When will you come?",
  "36632": "Is it possible, then, to love, if you are not loved?",
  "36633": "Will you be her servants?",
  "36634": "Would she never issue from it?",
  "36635": "There's nothing wrong?",
  "36636": "NOT a party in anything, ma'am?",
  "36637": "Then what?",
  "36638": "Supper?",
  "36639": "Can anyone do much for anyone else unless by making a will in his favour and dying then and there?",
  "36640": "Did we not leave her, but just now?",
  "36641": "Then?",
  "36642": "Has anything worried you?",
  "36643": "And who shall then stick closest to ye, and excite others?",
  "36644": "Can I rely upon you?",
  "36645": "Oh, you are the young feller who did that poster?",
  "36646": "I suppose you don't even know what a prig is?",
  "36647": "Don't you wish for anything else?",
  "36648": "Do you know of any houses?",
  "36649": "Do you mean to say that this slip of paper will help us?",
  "36650": "What identity?",
  "36651": "Did you bring the things I mentioned?",
  "36652": "But, my lord, if there be no secret of penitence, will the director consent to my being here?",
  "36653": "Do you have a faith, or a knowledge, you follow, which helps you to live and to do right?",
  "36654": "Is not this what we would have all men do to us?",
  "36655": "Well, there wasn't anything else for her to do, was there?",
  "36656": "You hussy, how dare you talk in that way?",
  "36657": "Now, what shall we do?",
  "36658": "Which should it be?",
  "36659": "Will you follow me?",
  "36660": "What else can I do?",
  "36661": "How would you like to come into a house and find everyone muttering to themselves?",
  "36662": "And can the just by justice make men unjust, or speaking general can the good by virtue make them bad?",
  "36663": "You're sure?",
  "36664": "Prime, isn't it?",
  "36665": "Are we to see profound wisdom in this?",
  "36666": "Is it not, said she, whispering her husband in his ear, is it not a noble nose?",
  "36667": "Who'll keep THEM quiet?",
  "36668": "Had any difference arisen between him and her papa?",
  "36669": "And what shall I?",
  "36670": "Not so much so?",
  "36671": "You are fond of it?",
  "36672": "May I see it?",
  "36673": "Tell me, do you know what the countess, for whose pardon you are beseeching me, has done?",
  "36674": "Had she not openly avowed her intention of marrying for money if she ever had the chance?",
  "36675": "That the boy may sink and perish?",
  "36676": "Whose there?",
  "36677": "Been there long?",
  "36678": "Which is the way?",
  "36679": "Or his starch'd beard?",
  "36680": "Who knows what may be in store for you yet?",
  "36681": "By this?",
  "36682": "And not long?",
  "36683": "Is that certain?",
  "36684": "Isn't it well drawn?",
  "36685": "Are you asleep?",
  "36686": "Any ideas?",
  "36687": "Have we been deceived by an illusion?",
  "36688": "Was it physical?",
  "36689": "Caution?",
  "36690": "Did not you know that, my dear lord?",
  "36691": "Did not your friend here look like me?",
  "36692": "What are you rattling in there?",
  "36693": "But again, will they tell us that such a nature, placed under favourable circumstances, will not be perfectly good and wise if any ever was?",
  "36694": "Has not one of you a cross?",
  "36695": "What happened to the worthy captain?",
  "36696": "And what does the judge affirm to be the life which is next, and the pleasure which is next?",
  "36697": "Was my uncle stark mad?",
  "36698": "You didn't think it could be so bad?",
  "36699": "You mean she won't mind?",
  "36700": "Or have we found angels in the forms of kings to govern him?",
  "36701": "More in your brains than in your pocket, eh?",
  "36702": "He has come, then, as they told me?",
  "36703": "The only unofficial detective?",
  "36704": "Have you had lunch yet?",
  "36705": "Far from here?",
  "36706": "Whither is it carrying me?",
  "36707": "And where are they looking for her?",
  "36708": "Can't you see that I'm as hoarse as a crow?",
  "36709": "But where is your master?",
  "36710": "Who told you this?",
  "36711": "Of what was he thinking?",
  "36712": "Do you think it is too much?",
  "36713": "D'you remember you were rather sniffy about meeting him?",
  "36714": "Is that what you wished to say?",
  "36715": "How much of the ballast of conservatism and of loyalty to tradition is it well to throw overboard in the interest of accelerated motion?",
  "36716": "Shall a similar end be pursued for the ethical purpose of widening the circle of those who shall live and be happy?",
  "36717": "Why have they not seized me?",
  "36718": "When did it happen and what has happened?",
  "36719": "You see?",
  "36720": "How could we like a people who treated us so unjustly?",
  "36721": "When shall the day come when we shall lift our hands?",
  "36722": "Are you then making a thesis?",
  "36723": "Would you like me to bring some rice?",
  "36724": "Who do you want?",
  "36725": "How did he get 'em?",
  "36726": "You wouldn't leave him lying maimed at the bottom of this dreadful place, a moment, if you could bring help to him?",
  "36727": "And is my life to be forfeit, is some terrible punishment to come on my poor old head for that which I cannot help?",
  "36728": "You will be frank with me?",
  "36729": "And was that the head and front of his offending?",
  "36730": "And must he not be represented as such?",
  "36731": "Yes, don't you wish you knew what that card was?",
  "36732": "But what's he doing here?",
  "36733": "He said nothing more?",
  "36734": "And even if he has done wrong, how do I know that he has not condemned himself?",
  "36735": "And do they give you frogs to eat, so's to make you limber?",
  "36736": "A doctor?",
  "36737": "What did you do?",
  "36738": "Would he allow imitation to be the ruling principle of his life, as if he had nothing higher in him?",
  "36739": "Wasn't it rather sudden?",
  "36740": "That's what you tell this gentleman too, is it?",
  "36741": "He's your husband, eh?",
  "36742": "Can I spare him?",
  "36743": "What now?",
  "36744": "Armed?",
  "36745": "Or may not all three be properly allotted to it?",
  "36746": "Anything up?",
  "36747": "Is that so?",
  "36748": "You do not wish to hear it, perhaps?",
  "36749": "What does it matter to me?",
  "36750": "And will not a true astronomer have the same feeling when he looks at the movements of the stars?",
  "36751": "Why, what else are they?",
  "36752": "And s'pose he steps in here any minute, and sings out my name before I can throw him a wink to keep quiet?",
  "36753": "And the just is the good?",
  "36754": "How have I deviated from those principles, monsieur?",
  "36755": "But why FOUR pounds?",
  "36756": "And what did you find?",
  "36757": "What has he come here for?",
  "36758": "Are you inside?",
  "36759": "Downright?",
  "36760": "Do you think she'll miss you?",
  "36761": "Speak I sooth, my masters?",
  "36762": "Why was it necessary to weave the queen into this gloomy web of guilt and crime?",
  "36763": "I suppose that is why you live in town?",
  "36764": "What was the result of that memorable expedition?",
  "36765": "What, then, is the defence?",
  "36766": "What do you mean by risk?",
  "36767": "What would be the use?",
  "36768": "How could she make such nails work?",
  "36769": "Am I not the wife of my husband?",
  "36770": "What came after?",
  "36771": "What is the proposition?",
  "36772": "So?",
  "36773": "How is the snatchblatch?",
  "36774": "Just?",
  "36775": "Did you hear anything of it when you were in those parts?",
  "36776": "What is in this?",
  "36777": "And through what deplorable madness had she thus ruined her life by continual sacrifices?",
  "36778": "Where are the marks of its fangs?",
  "36779": "What d'you say to having something to eat?",
  "36780": "Who was this novice in war with the effrontery of a luminary?",
  "36781": "In my precinct?",
  "36782": "Is she, my lord?",
  "36783": "May this young lady go with us?",
  "36784": "Has no one come to seek her in this land?",
  "36785": "Hadn't we better hear it tomorrow?",
  "36786": "Then you'll be free?",
  "36787": "Monseigneur?",
  "36788": "Is it not sad?",
  "36789": "Can people enchant each other too much, cajole each other too much, charm each other too much?",
  "36790": "Why do they grease the axles of the wheels?",
  "36791": "If there be doubt as to which of our divisions will get our candidate, is there no doubt as to which of your candidates will get your party?",
  "36792": "What did you take me to your mother for?",
  "36793": "And did they ask you to make a speech?",
  "36794": "Don't you see it is hard enough for her already?",
  "36795": "Some such object it was, that induced you to call on me?",
  "36796": "But how about money?",
  "36797": "You here at this hour?",
  "36798": "Well, then, was it this eye or that through which you dropped the beetle?",
  "36799": "What did your excellency say?",
  "36800": "Where are you going, you rascal?",
  "36801": "Do you know, my friends, what that plain, seen from the height we are at, resembles?",
  "36802": "What was the good of bringing him?",
  "36803": "Where was it?",
  "36804": "Would she be decent to him, or would she scold him?",
  "36805": "Which is the best wish to wish him?",
  "36806": "How CAN you say 'I am happier,' and nothing changed?",
  "36807": "Why sadden the poor children, and damp their newly cherished hopes?",
  "36808": "And you feel convinced that you must break with him?",
  "36809": "Alone, where?",
  "36810": "And you saw him frequently?",
  "36811": "Why is she so glad?",
  "36812": "But why do you ask?",
  "36813": "What new treasures lay here for science to unfold?",
  "36814": "What do ye want?",
  "36815": "Rochester?",
  "36816": "What's coming on?",
  "36817": "Are we to wonder, then, if here and there we find in his works an offensive expression?",
  "36818": "Why not cut it?",
  "36819": "What does the letter mean, mother?",
  "36820": "Are we rising into a fiery furnace?",
  "36821": "What substances will you proscribe?",
  "36822": "And what method of surveillance do you employ?",
  "36823": "Oh, well, as it were, what?",
  "36824": "You think so?",
  "36825": "Of how much?",
  "36826": "But we could not prevent it, could we?",
  "36827": "You get your percentage out o' the purchase, I suppose?",
  "36828": "Food enough for all?",
  "36829": "Why doesn't she want it now?",
  "36830": "On the other hand, would he not, by remaining to meet a fate almost inevitable, incur the guilt of suicide?",
  "36831": "Has she told you she likes me much?",
  "36832": "Why should I envy them?",
  "36833": "What did he say to you?",
  "36834": "But if he were taken back again he would imagine, and truly imagine, that he was descending?",
  "36835": "My friend, my friend, why thus grieve me?",
  "36836": "How does that strike you?",
  "36837": "Forty pounds?",
  "36838": "You'll have to, then, won't you?",
  "36839": "But I mean another piece?",
  "36840": "Are all voters enlightened?",
  "36841": "And his level, whether higher or lower, could it possibly be the same as hers?",
  "36842": "What makes you so sure?",
  "36843": "What is it in the nature of the oak that causes it to send its root down into the soil and to drink up of its substance?",
  "36844": "What's he going to read?",
  "36845": "Where shall I go?",
  "36846": "What was the primitive tissue?",
  "36847": "How much do you pay a week?",
  "36848": "Why shouldn't I conscientiously?",
  "36849": "And he is named?",
  "36850": "How came you by the knowledge?",
  "36851": "Is it not one part of honesty to be dutiful and grateful to your master, do you think?",
  "36852": "Why not win to freedom?",
  "36853": "Does he?",
  "36854": "And if not in the worst, why is it to follow at all?",
  "36855": "What, pray?",
  "36856": "Wherefore?",
  "36857": "Shall I be that?",
  "36858": "And what shall we say of such things as religious duties, of cheerfulness, of good manners, of personal cleanliness?",
  "36859": "Or, have you been a bad steward to yourself, and wasted your property in lawsuits and the like?",
  "36860": "Ah, who put it up?",
  "36861": "But light?",
  "36862": "What has opened her eyes?",
  "36863": "Do you want him?",
  "36864": "And would you indeed damn your precious soul?",
  "36865": "Well, did you see her safely off?",
  "36866": "But is he engaged to her?",
  "36867": "Why, how are all the folks at home?",
  "36868": "Are these persons, then, so rich and powerful?",
  "36869": "Can it give heat to a dead body?",
  "36870": "Don't you think so?",
  "36871": "Where's the use of looking nice, when no one sees me but those cross midgets, and no one cares whether I'm pretty or not?",
  "36872": "And the king has seen the cardinal?",
  "36873": "Detain him?",
  "36874": "And return to life, if there be such a thing, is the birth of the dead into the world of the living?",
  "36875": "Or do you also hate the duke your husband?",
  "36876": "Do you know who it is from?",
  "36877": "Have you been to the opera?",
  "36878": "Not a word to your loving mother, who was growing older too?",
  "36879": "Would you be at ease, and feel that you had played an open part?",
  "36880": "Has your majesty no other orders to give me?",
  "36881": "But what are you going to do with him, now he is alive?",
  "36882": "And what shall I do when papa and you leave me, and I am by myself?",
  "36883": "Why is he sleeping there?",
  "36884": "Had he not told her, yes, told her to make a list, and not to admit anyone who was not on that list?",
  "36885": "Were her fears realized?",
  "36886": "I suppose it bowled the poor blighter over absolutely?",
  "36887": "Who introduced this innovation?",
  "36888": "You are perhaps a tulip fancier?",
  "36889": "May I go in and look?",
  "36890": "When will we be married?",
  "36891": "You're in the habit of shaking hands?",
  "36892": "And which is wise and which is foolish?",
  "36893": "But then he had the woman he loved still remaining?",
  "36894": "Shall I then?",
  "36895": "All ready forward?",
  "36896": "Is there any one here?",
  "36897": "But can such a head be found?",
  "36898": "And ten?",
  "36899": "Do you think if I drink water it would take off this hiccup?",
  "36900": "And this one opposite, who is this?",
  "36901": "Neither may they imitate smiths or other artificers, or oarsmen, or boatswains, or the like?",
  "36902": "You'll be ready this day week, will you?",
  "36903": "What was become of them?",
  "36904": "Shall we gather strength but irresolution and inaction?",
  "36905": "And what was in the sealed iron chest?",
  "36906": "Shall I put a little more tea in the pot afore I go, ma'am?",
  "36907": "And what can you conceive more deadly?",
  "36908": "Why did you do it?",
  "36909": "What does she want?",
  "36910": "How do you know about it, and who are you, anyhow?",
  "36911": "What next?",
  "36912": "Deserted?",
  "36913": "When did you get in?",
  "36914": "Will it hit us?",
  "36915": "Do you want to be doing the same?",
  "36916": "Who will bring us bread?",
  "36917": "My friend, what do you tell me?",
  "36918": "Their whistle?",
  "36919": "Where in the world did you get that song?",
  "36920": "Is he very clever?",
  "36921": "Fine stepper, wasn't she?",
  "36922": "Who did I get the statues from?",
  "36923": "Will you have some whiskey and water?",
  "36924": "What news?",
  "36925": "Struck me?",
  "36926": "And you are up?",
  "36927": "What point?",
  "36928": "Don't you know me?",
  "36929": "What is the use of one horse for us two?",
  "36930": "The cardinal was your protector?",
  "36931": "Isn't it splendid to be that kind, teacher?",
  "36932": "Are the other camels better or worse than that?",
  "36933": "Isn't what they have done already enough?",
  "36934": "What two lines?",
  "36935": "At twenty minutes to nine?",
  "36936": "Whom have I to love?",
  "36937": "And the rocks with their various strata?",
  "36938": "Did I not say right?",
  "36939": "What could he, an old man, do?",
  "36940": "And now what does he do?",
  "36941": "Is he so?",
  "36942": "Can't you comprehend that an affection may be genuine as felt by the man, yet its nature be spurious in relation to others?",
  "36943": "Then, at all events, he DID sleep here, did he?",
  "36944": "My name?",
  "36945": "And why should I not?",
  "36946": "How could I escape from this situation?",
  "36947": "Don't you know what it means to me?",
  "36948": "Which was the more important, which the less important part?",
  "36949": "You call them that, too?",
  "36950": "But by what means?",
  "36951": "Not come yet?",
  "36952": "Ever hear of lones the packer, hey, ole chappie?",
  "36953": "Is it quite original?",
  "36954": "Did he do that?",
  "36955": "Why should he trust himself to a balloon, that would blaze up like a piece of paper?",
  "36956": "Now, an't it?",
  "36957": "And don't I suppose his was the first face she saw, as she passed through the storm and the night to that waiting, beautiful place?",
  "36958": "You saw it?",
  "36959": "Like him?",
  "36960": "Would you take a seat, sir?",
  "36961": "And yet what else am I to do?",
  "36962": "Well, have you heard from your husband lately, my dear?",
  "36963": "You refused him?",
  "36964": "How did you know that?",
  "36965": "Can she make your real flecky paste, as melts in your mouth, and lies all up like a puff?",
  "36966": "Whence comes this?",
  "36967": "Yes, what is it?",
  "36968": "Should he stay at home with her, her mother and her sisters?",
  "36969": "What can I do to prevent it?",
  "36970": "Have been brought together, eh?",
  "36971": "Would you like to come up and see her?",
  "36972": "What would you like to do tomorrow?",
  "36973": "Will that arrangement suit you?",
  "36974": "And you shall be included in it, in our happiness, do you hear, father?",
  "36975": "FLOATED?",
  "36976": "Have you eaten anything?",
  "36977": "How d'you know I want to travel?",
  "36978": "Did she feel as he did?",
  "36979": "Water to drink?",
  "36980": "You will not serve me, sir, will you?",
  "36981": "How should he be?",
  "36982": "Again, has he greater experience of the pleasures of honour, or the lover of honour of the pleasures of wisdom?",
  "36983": "Is it nothing to hold one's peace?",
  "36984": "And you can do nothing until then?",
  "36985": "When, where?",
  "36986": "Is there generally?",
  "36987": "Yes, but still all this has to be looked after, and who is there to look after it?",
  "36988": "You a chief, eh?",
  "36989": "How much will you give me for it?",
  "36990": "What have I to say to them?",
  "36991": "Now what do you think on't, neighbour, my friend?",
  "36992": "When are you coming back?",
  "36993": "Can anyone be surprised if one gets fond of such a ship?",
  "36994": "Oh, not her?",
  "36995": "But what is worship?",
  "36996": "Why do you not speak to me?",
  "36997": "In arms against me?",
  "36998": "Do you wish for a proof?",
  "36999": "I can't say more than that, can I?",
  "37000": "Where, then?",
  "37001": "Prove?",
  "37002": "Little woman?",
  "37003": "Shall it be said, good reader?",
  "37004": "Are you glad to leave us, dear?",
  "37005": "What had that harsh tyrant of hers done that was good or serviceable for her?",
  "37006": "And the mistress?",
  "37007": "Can one be well while suffering morally?",
  "37008": "Where would be that thrill if I had been as definite as a timetable?",
  "37009": "How long otherwise?",
  "37010": "Tony, where are you going, my charmer?",
  "37011": "What does this tell us?",
  "37012": "How does she use you?",
  "37013": "Have you nothing else to ask him, sir?",
  "37014": "In the nick of time?",
  "37015": "How?",
  "37016": "Mind it?",
  "37017": "How can I help myself?",
  "37018": "Where has he gone?",
  "37019": "That visit not succeeding either, you will go again perhaps?",
  "37020": "Husband, are you as kind and gentle toward your wife as you should be?",
  "37021": "For what is death?",
  "37022": "If I see, clearly see, that ladder leading from plant to man, why should I suppose it breaks off at me and does not go farther and farther?",
  "37023": "Lively?",
  "37024": "Another glass?",
  "37025": "But the great point is, is there a 'Rita' on the list?",
  "37026": "Don't you hear?",
  "37027": "What was the difference whether the alms were given into my hands or into my wife's?",
  "37028": "Do you tell me that the woman is dead?",
  "37029": "Did he take that medicine, men?",
  "37030": "Who would suppose it?",
  "37031": "When was that done which settled the matter?",
  "37032": "What did you say, sir?",
  "37033": "Well and what am I to do now?",
  "37034": "I couldn't do anything better for her than advise her to accept these proposals, could I?",
  "37035": "What would be the result of a total extraction of the nitrogen?",
  "37036": "Do you not suspect?",
  "37037": "Did it keep you awake?",
  "37038": "Did he think that pride or masterful will or physical strength would help him?",
  "37039": "Need any help, officer?",
  "37040": "What's the row now?",
  "37041": "Why are you so bad?",
  "37042": "She never spoke to a soul?",
  "37043": "DO you think race corresponds with nationality?",
  "37044": "Could I ever have believed then that I could come to such humiliation?",
  "37045": "Do you belong to the nobility?",
  "37046": "D'you think they care for us?",
  "37047": "You bring me great news, then, monsieur?",
  "37048": "Did I say above, or seem to imply, that the judge sometimes spoke harshly to his wife?",
  "37049": "Not in health?",
  "37050": "And we have admitted that justice is the excellence of the soul, and injustice the defect of the soul?",
  "37051": "Did you really?",
  "37052": "What was he doing?",
  "37053": "Didn't you know the difference yourself?",
  "37054": "Is he out of his senses?",
  "37055": "Who then?",
  "37056": "Why do I feel so inclined to tease him?",
  "37057": "What monstrous place is this?",
  "37058": "Why can't you leave me alone?",
  "37059": "Where is the use of our reckoning?",
  "37060": "Why isn't it your business?",
  "37061": "Then you don't wish me to, dearest?",
  "37062": "You are AFRAID of it?",
  "37063": "Don't they come after it any more?",
  "37064": "Where is the prisoner?",
  "37065": "Is he generally liked?",
  "37066": "Do you mean write to her myself?",
  "37067": "So soon?",
  "37068": "Will not the guardians be the smallest of all the classes who receive a name from the profession of some kind of knowledge?",
  "37069": "A telegram?",
  "37070": "That's the boy, is it?",
  "37071": "At whose house?",
  "37072": "Is this possible, count?",
  "37073": "Which of them do you call her best friend?",
  "37074": "Is sugar always to be produced by vital blood?",
  "37075": "Was it a fear that he should deliver this name to the hazards of another memory than his own?",
  "37076": "You think it's certain he's there?",
  "37077": "Would they not have been as unwilling to part with them as with gold, and have compelled them to stay at home with them?",
  "37078": "Who did you pass on the road?",
  "37079": "What could she do but sob?",
  "37080": "What was that you told me before we left the old house?",
  "37081": "Beautiful and lusty?",
  "37082": "And is not the soul almost or altogether indissoluble?",
  "37083": "Buried amongst them, what met my eye?",
  "37084": "Yes, isn't it extraordinarily fine?",
  "37085": "What is the matter with him?",
  "37086": "Might he not well inform the doctor that he had something to tell him for his advantage?",
  "37087": "But how can we gain your freedom?",
  "37088": "Or is this a subject in which new discoveries can be made?",
  "37089": "Or haven't you pluck enough to go on?",
  "37090": "Has he got to be harnessed up and driven through life like a horse?",
  "37091": "What to do with him?",
  "37092": "If she had died, or if we hadn't caught her, where should we all have been?",
  "37093": "Assuming also, again I say, that physical obstacles can be overcome, is not the time opportune for making a start?",
  "37094": "Yeh infernal fool, don't yeh know enough t' quit when there ain't anything t' shoot at?",
  "37095": "Why should it?",
  "37096": "Don't you love to ride?",
  "37097": "Are you badly hurt?",
  "37098": "Has he many men, then?",
  "37099": "Will there be mercy for me there?",
  "37100": "I hope your father is well?",
  "37101": "Why then am I dissatisfied if I am going to do the things for which I exist and for which I was brought into the world?",
  "37102": "I tell you?",
  "37103": "You are no longer my father?",
  "37104": "And why, my young friend?",
  "37105": "If we were jurymen, what would we do with this parricide?",
  "37106": "What did they do it for then?",
  "37107": "Can you rely on his word?",
  "37108": "Why the coal country?",
  "37109": "Is that possible?",
  "37110": "What the prime cause of all my woe doth prove?",
  "37111": "Well, brigadier, what is he charged with?",
  "37112": "Look here, what does this mean?",
  "37113": "Liver?",
  "37114": "Will you not speak to them?",
  "37115": "Why, who are you, bold fellow, to range so boldly here?",
  "37116": "You want to speak to me, do you?",
  "37117": "And where is the wounded officer?",
  "37118": "And afterwards?",
  "37119": "What is your illustration?",
  "37120": "Well, you must be most starved, ain't you?",
  "37121": "He has still hope, but what is it he hopes?",
  "37122": "In a tree?",
  "37123": "The question is, whether it procures most pain or pleasure?",
  "37124": "What's the matter with your legs?",
  "37125": "Who says that?",
  "37126": "How can I play a trick on a monkey?",
  "37127": "What kind of a bird is he?",
  "37128": "But how did you come here?",
  "37129": "Then it is settled?",
  "37130": "Where am I to die?",
  "37131": "What ought to be done?",
  "37132": "How now?",
  "37133": "Isn't she split in half?",
  "37134": "But will you tell me?",
  "37135": "And do the enchanted sleep, now, senor?",
  "37136": "Is there anything else you would like?",
  "37137": "And you DO think something better of me than you did?",
  "37138": "What do I want with the lawyer?",
  "37139": "Shall I not visit for these things?",
  "37140": "You couldn't quite call it poetry, I suppose, but it sounds a lot like it, doesn't it?",
  "37141": "And how did it go so fast, so straight ahead, with such staring, staring eyes?",
  "37142": "Should I have to hand over?",
  "37143": "Do they love?",
  "37144": "What should be done with the elephant, which had been so dearly purchased?",
  "37145": "Was he not handsome?",
  "37146": "In making him a duke?",
  "37147": "How can you dare to speak to me like that?",
  "37148": "Whose was it?",
  "37149": "How did I lose her?",
  "37150": "Well, and what did the lady do?",
  "37151": "This has been done so often, and what good has ever come from it?",
  "37152": "Where do the lord and lady sleep?",
  "37153": "But whither am I wandering?",
  "37154": "With what kind of order?",
  "37155": "But do you think we shall find the count at home?",
  "37156": "And what I am, to you my friends, now am I not?",
  "37157": "Do you conceive any thing but merely that perception?",
  "37158": "Don't you wish you may get it?",
  "37159": "Who are these men you have brought before us?",
  "37160": "Some one holds you in restraint?",
  "37161": "Did you think he came directly from town?",
  "37162": "Will you breakfast with me tomorrow morning?",
  "37163": "Dearest, what?",
  "37164": "What's the news?",
  "37165": "Why don't you ask some nice people in to dinner?",
  "37166": "And had you made up your mind what to say to him?",
  "37167": "Is not the president's shoulder still bleeding from the blow it has received?",
  "37168": "Wiggins?",
  "37169": "Oh, when are you going?",
  "37170": "Why should I care?",
  "37171": "What could you do for a boy like that?",
  "37172": "Does it think?",
  "37173": "Why should we ask what comes after the experience, when the experience is still unknown to us?",
  "37174": "Was he not the prince of men?",
  "37175": "Are not these dread words for a nation bearing in her bosom so mighty an injustice?",
  "37176": "What has happened?",
  "37177": "How is a woman to live if she doesn't know how much she has got to spend?",
  "37178": "On what days?",
  "37179": "Or what hopes have we of deliverance by thus continuing faithful to such wicked wretches?",
  "37180": "Who's accused you?",
  "37181": "What's one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one?",
  "37182": "But the question again recurs, upon what pretense could he be put in possession of a force of that magnitude in time of peace?",
  "37183": "What can I do for the son?",
  "37184": "What, after the last?",
  "37185": "That I might lose them?",
  "37186": "Who is my mother?",
  "37187": "You want a lot, don't you?",
  "37188": "Don't you find, that things fail to materialise?",
  "37189": "Why not let me send for this pleasant lady?",
  "37190": "Where have you come from?",
  "37191": "Will somebody obleege me with a spittoon?",
  "37192": "Do you think it is a wig?",
  "37193": "You sat in front of his writing desk?",
  "37194": "Where could my uncle be at that moment?",
  "37195": "Does he not want anything else?",
  "37196": "Why should I guard me?",
  "37197": "Mayn't I treat you as a lover?",
  "37198": "Why did he not tell it?",
  "37199": "What was the reply?",
  "37200": "Did business men commonly go into an expenditure of money which could be of no account to them?",
  "37201": "And then, in the next place, was it probable that the dean would act upon such a letter by filling up the vacancy, even if he did get it?",

  "37207": "Shall I go?",
  "37208": "On what charge do you expect to be arrested?",
  "37209": "But what can we expect from a turnip?",

  "37263": "What sort of a life could we build on such foundations?",
  "37264": "Ay, said I, but who can help constitution?",
  "37265": "Not chilled, pet, are you?",
  "37266": "Gone?",
  "37267": "Where had you seen me before?",
  "37268": "And if she won't tell?",
  "37269": "And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a fait accompli?",
  "37270": "And to sign the contract in three days?",
  "37271": "Could it be that the unfortunate man had committed suicide, overcome by his troubles?",
  "37272": "And that is your opinion?",

  "37282": "What then, when that's once done?",
  "37283": "Then why did you come here, my dear?",
  "37284": "Why should my courtesie to these knights go all for naught?",
  "37285": "Was I, then, a monster, a blot upon the earth, from which all men fled and whom all men disowned?",
  "37286": "Could the latter for a moment suppose that the son would not offer the best part to the father?",
  "37287": "Why should she be sorry?",

  "37289": "Seek introductions, draw petitions up?",
  "37290": "How do we know what is at the bottom of his sudden interest in you?",
  "37291": "Wherefore?",
  "37292": "How do you account for this?",
  "37293": "And on what occasions have such favors been bestowed upon you?",
  "37294": "Do you think that will be really necessary?",

  "37309": "How does he get it, then?",
  "37310": "Can it be believed that they would thus act to no purpose during their courtship?",
  "37311": "How know you this man has?",
  "37312": "You aren't angry, are you?",
  "37313": "From whence, I ask, could he gain that knowledge, but from the study of the true theology?",
  "37314": "Was there ever such a sober, sentimental interview?",
  "37315": "And as it is to so go at all events, may we not agree that the sooner the better?",
  "37316": "Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?",
  "37317": "And why were you not willing?",
  "37318": "Are you so and so?",
  "37319": "Come, now, tell me, you want me very much to stay, don't you?",
  "37320": "May I suppose that you have this distinction of the visible and intelligible fixed in your mind?",
  "37321": "What's the good of getting away?",
  "37322": "Is it not adherence to the old and tried, against the new and untried?",
  "37323": "What can I do?",
  "37324": "Are or are not our interests conflicting?",
  "37325": "And by whom were they recommended to you?",
  "37326": "Paid according to the labor that they had performed, of what could they complain?",
  "37327": "What would his guards think if they heard him shout like a madman?",
  "37328": "How about the lion and the lioness?",
  "37329": "Don't you see her?",
  "37330": "Had they been heard?",
  "37331": "You are pleased it is a girl?",
  "37332": "Why should not schools be established, a comfortable hotel be erected, a church be built?",
  "37333": "What the devil is the meaning of all this?",
  "37334": "I suppose your people will be here to meet you?",
  "37335": "What could hinder the poor canoe, followed by sea and watched from the shore, from succumbing before the end of the day?",

  "37353": "That's the boy, is it?",
  "37354": "But did you ever like knocking about in such discomfort?",
  "37355": "Where was it to come from?",
  "37356": "How did he manage it?",
  "37357": "Now then, what is it, my young woman?",
  "37358": "What can we do for you?",
  "37359": "What commission is this you give me, and what do you charge me to tell his majesty, monsieur?",
  "37360": "It's capital for us here, but what of him?",

  "37373": "Will we play our part well?",
  "37374": "Can you not see the hint there is in the practice to such as go searching for secrets?",
  "37375": "You truly wish me to go?",
  "37376": "But then you yourself are known to others?",
  "37377": "Is there anything else you wouldn't wish me to do?",
  "37378": "And who thus advised you?",
  "37379": "Well, have you any news?",

  "37595": "Up the chimney?",
  "37596": "Why shouldn't I flirt with her daughter?",
  "37597": "Don't, eh?",
  "37598": "You are the day porter, are you not?",
  "37599": "Is it not, indeed, the height of imprudence to grant equality of political rights to men of unequal conditions?",
  "37600": "Whom did it prosper?",
  "37601": "Has not art found that she is beautiful?",
  "37602": "The hopes and dreams so lately come, were they only hopes and dreams?",
  "37603": "Who knows if she is right?",
  "37604": "An allusion to what?",
  "37605": "Do you think, my dear father and mother, there ever was so happy a creature as I?",
  "37606": "From what head could the lock be cut but mine?",
  "37607": "Why can't you be single by yourself, as you are always saying?",
  "37608": "Don't you know it?",
  "37609": "Will you never let us go?",
  "37610": "But what had happened to you?",
  "37611": "Are we quite alone, my friend?",
  "37612": "What is his name, and where do I find him?",
  "37613": "How are things going on at home?",
  "37614": "How are you, old neighbour?",
  "37615": "Do you mind if I come over to this table?",
  "37616": "What would you have done?",
  "37617": "Was it fear of not obtaining that succor I stood in need of, which agitated me to this degree?",
  "37618": "Is this going to suit every one?",
  "37619": "And why don't you take that other person?",
  "37620": "May I go and tell him you are here?",
  "37621": "When shall you be in?",
  "37622": "But he's very queer, isn't he?",
  "37623": "Your women, I believe, were something awful, were they not?",
  "37624": "No use at all?",
  "37625": "For whom?",
  "37626": "Who do you suppose is with me?",
  "37627": "Where did you get the mouth and chin from?",
  "37628": "Has he got her?",
  "37629": "Catherine?",
  "37630": "Will you not take your dispatch hence yet?",
  "37631": "What is generated from the living?",
  "37632": "Is there anything you want that would lessen the hardship of this confinement?",
  "37633": "Should I now?",
  "37634": "Do you not approve of my plan, my friend?",
  "37635": "Die?",
  "37636": "Is this all the distinction of the rich in the grave?",
  "37637": "Some have been served so?",
  "37638": "Shall I see you?",
  "37639": "But what is this, count, only one glass?",
  "37640": "Why should I not give him my heart, since, thanks to your intercession, I am no longer bound to choose a husband of equal birth?",
  "37641": "And for pirates?",
  "37642": "O, THAT'S your errand, is it?",
  "37643": "You weep for my danger?",
  "37644": "Are you the master of the boat?",
  "37645": "And what is easier than for an intelligent government to so manage all industrial transitions?",
  "37646": "Why is it, then, that this interest on capital is not regarded as a sufficient supplement of net product?",
  "37647": "She's not seriously hurt?",
  "37648": "Well, and for whom are you going to look for her?",
  "37649": "No smell?",
  "37650": "Of what tendency is that change?",
  "37651": "The effect of habits left?",
  "37652": "Is it you?",
  "37653": "Are we cannibals, let me ask?",
  "37654": "Which key was used to open it?",
  "37655": "Not to give me a kiss?",
  "37656": "Than any one at all?",
  "37657": "You've fed my body and saved my soul, haven't you?",
  "37658": "Something to my advantage?",
  "37659": "What did she really want?",
  "37660": "Have I done anything to you?",
  "37661": "Sermons?",
  "37662": "Didn't I make that interrigation point nice?",
  "37663": "This man?",
  "37664": "And he isn't conceited, is he?",
  "37665": "Forgot?",
  "37666": "How can the way of a superior man be such as to make fools of any of them?",
  "37667": "And did your superior order you to treat me in this way?",
  "37668": "Give me leave to crave your name, sir?",
  "37669": "And what lies beyond?",
  "37670": "Or the knowledge of all other things if we have no knowledge of beauty and goodness?",
  "37671": "How comes it, then, that he is prince of devils?",
  "37672": "Does the injustice or other evil which exists in the soul waste and consume her?",
  "37673": "Have you no sense to devise a system which will make you independent of all efforts, and all wills, but your own?",
  "37674": "Did I intend to insult him?",
  "37675": "And how do you do, sir?",
  "37676": "Have you been here ever since?",
  "37677": "What did I come here to seek?",
  "37678": "What is this business about?",
  "37679": "Where did you start up from?",
  "37680": "You repeated to yourself this morning the brief scene of last night?",
  "37681": "Isn't a girl allowed to change her mind?",
  "37682": "You let the cage alone, and let me wring its neck will you?",
  "37683": "For if he who resolveth bravely oftentimes falleth short, how shall it be with him who resolveth rarely or feebly?",
  "37684": "Which wings must I flop first?",
  "37685": "Will you talk sensibly?",
  "37686": "What time was that?",
  "37687": "Well, if you're happy, why don't you look happy, as we do?",
  "37688": "Are they not grotesquely trying?",
  "37689": "Then he has not returned?",
  "37690": "A worm of the earth in a carriage?",
  "37691": "And if not now, when?",
  "37692": "Is it in your dwelling?",
  "37693": "Did you suppose it wasn't going to rise?",
  "37694": "Would you not choose me rather than the other?",
  "37695": "What shall I say?",
  "37696": "And that running footman who waited at the door, and that carriage with a coachman in grand livery who sat waiting on his seat?",
  "37697": "I have told you, have I not, that you are too late?",
  "37698": "And how was he to answer this?",
  "37699": "D'you WANT to come away with me?",
  "37700": "Do you think it a good one?",
  "37701": "Would he remember what took place in the relapse?",
  "37702": "And what do you call these?",
  "37703": "Who shall rebuild that building?",
  "37704": "SHALL I wish you good day for the present on the part of myself and the gentleman of the house?",
  "37705": "What kind of insect?",
  "37706": "It rings true, eh?",
  "37707": "Not good enough to stand it?",
  "37708": "How many times are you supposing that she has tried?",
  "37709": "And what similar use or power of acquisition has justice in time of peace?",
  "37710": "Will my bane perhaps come out of it?",
  "37711": "What can you give us for supper?",
  "37712": "Who shall go, then?",
  "37713": "Who was ever more ardently and deeply regretted?",
  "37714": "Who has not had their letters, with the wafers wet, and the announcement that a person is waiting in the hall?",
  "37715": "Expenses of journeys?",
  "37716": "Who said?",
  "37717": "My income?",
  "37718": "What am I to do at all?",
  "37719": "Or, do you mean that I am an atheist simply, and a teacher of atheism?",
  "37720": "Which means that you now hesitate?",
  "37721": "Well, are you going?",
  "37722": "No, but why do you think so?",
  "37723": "Do you wish to know the regulator of a society?",
  "37724": "Do you see any change in the water ?",
  "37725": "It would be very easy if you much wished it?",
  "37726": "Now can't you set aside these notions of yours?",
  "37727": "Did he, indeed?",
  "37728": "Lieutenant in the king's musketeers?",
  "37729": "But is not this his land?",
  "37730": "Mamma, couldn't I speak to her?",
  "37731": "In the left side, was it not, and with a knife?",
  "37732": "Don't you know I'm the soul of honour?",
  "37733": "How can I go and fetch that letter under the fire of the bastion?",
  "37734": "But, uncle, is it true?",
  "37735": "You are sure that is where he was going?",
  "37736": "Is the doctor here?",
  "37737": "Do you think that you wish to see him again?",
  "37738": "Is that a woman in breeches?",
  "37739": "And anybody could call you up at any time and talk?",
  "37740": "Well, you find it exciting too?",
  "37741": "Then this house does not belong to that tall lady who wears a watch, and who said we were to have some bread and cheese?",
  "37742": "For me?",
  "37743": "Do you think you will ever get to college?",
  "37744": "Aren't you glad I did it?",
  "37745": "Where does that light come from?",
  "37746": "Hasn't their uncle been heard from?",
  "37747": "Or whether we received a fair compensation for the extent of country ceded by these four individuals?",
  "37748": "And he is good in as far as he is wise, and bad in as far as he is foolish?",
  "37749": "Oh, that's what you're after, is it?",
  "37750": "And with her lover?",
  "37751": "Did it bite?",
  "37752": "What would become of her?",
  "37753": "You wonder I didn't go ashore for a howl and a dance?",
  "37754": "Why do you make a scene about it?",
  "37755": "Then you remember everything that went on about you from the time when you were three years old?",
  "37756": "Do you think it was all an illusion?",
  "37757": "But why so many precautions?",
  "37758": "Was ever the like heard, my dear father and mother?",
  "37759": "Mayn't I come too?",
  "37760": "Why not he?",
  "37761": "What is freedom for?",
  "37762": "Do they pretend that he named the man who lent me the money?",
  "37763": "Is that quite a little wish?",
  "37764": "And if not prayers, what then?",
  "37765": "So you'll give her the packet?",
  "37766": "Why are they running?",
  "37767": "What do you think of my situation?",
  "37768": "But where are we all going?",
  "37769": "Am I a sight, that you stand gazing there?",
  "37770": "Why, what is one to think?",
  "37771": "What did they expect of her?",
  "37772": "What would the result be, after marching blindly for so long and over such impossible ground, as we had been doing?",
  "37773": "Shall I then ever see this?",
  "37774": "To walk across the moor?",
  "37775": "Come now, what was this duel about?",
  "37776": "From whom comes this letter?",
  "37777": "What makes you behave so?",
  "37778": "Isn't it a dog?",
  "37779": "These gentlemen are with you?",
  "37780": "And what did you do?",
  "37781": "Hurt I modesty?",
  "37782": "Is there anyone I can write to for a reference?",
  "37783": "How much do you mean to say it wants then?",
  "37784": "In practice here?",
  "37785": "But would the subterranean fires provoke any violent eruption?",
  "37786": "Could it lie?",
  "37787": "Then you pity him?",
  "37788": "Was it hard to be free?",
  "37789": "Has he gone intending not to return?",
  "37790": "Your servant?",
  "37791": "Do bulbs live a long time?",
  "37792": "Ye NEW philosophers?",
  "37793": "Well, how did you get along?",
  "37794": "Were you dancing?",
  "37795": "When was it inhabited?",
  "37796": "Shall I help you?",
  "37797": "And one woman has a turn for gymnastic and military exercises, and another is unwarlike and hates gymnastics?",
  "37798": "What for use?",
  "37799": "Or was it possible that his guardian was anxious to prevent him from marrying from some view of the reversion of the large fortune?",
  "37800": "What is slang?",
  "37801": "There he is, do you see him?",
  "37802": "Just oblige me with that torch again, will you?",
  "37803": "And what classes of chance people come to practise at your gallery?",
  "37804": "Why was the expression of the whole face so cold and severe?",
  "37805": "Well, and was she standing with him, my good girl?",
  "37806": "And anything which is infected by any of these evils is made evil, and at last wholly dissolves and dies?",
  "37807": "And now, where are you going, viscount?",
  "37808": "Gunnar asked if he had ever sailed to other lands?",
  "37809": "How many centuries does a mind require to be understood?",
  "37810": "Did you not say she was dead?",
  "37811": "And she came to you?",
  "37812": "Isn't it?",
  "37813": "Have you really any great news to tell me?",
  "37814": "But you comprehend me?",
  "37815": "Or was it through your hard endurances of cold and hunger?",
  "37816": "Why, yes, didn't you know that?",
  "37817": "You think she wouldn't have run away?",
  "37818": "And what is your name?",
  "37819": "Suppose it should be a serpent?",
  "37820": "Will you give it up?",
  "37821": "Is it not because there would be something egregiously unfashionable in it?",
  "37822": "Is he in?",
  "37823": "How mend matters?",
  "37824": "Ho, ho, ho, ho, my good people, my friends and my faithful servants, must I hinder you from helping me?",
  "37825": "And should you like to fall into that pit, and to be burning there for ever?",
  "37826": "What is the day?",
  "37827": "But do you observe the reason of this?",
  "37828": "Why have them?",
  "37829": "And the heart trouble?",
  "37830": "How many of those?",
  "37831": "Who still wanteth to rule?",
  "37832": "Have we not seen dogs more faithful and intelligent than men, and men who are more stupid and brutal than any animals?",
  "37833": "Surely not?",
  "37834": "How do you know he is not the question now?",
  "37835": "To keep 'em safe, sir, don't you see?",
  "37836": "Can't you make them hear?",
  "37837": "Or was it today, because it was so wet that I couldn't get out?",
  "37838": "That is so, isn't it?",
  "37839": "And why does he say no more?",
  "37840": "Are there not the children for you to mind?",
  "37841": "Are you certainly going tomorrow then?",
  "37842": "Why the devil, then, do we plague ourselves about money, when there is a diamond?",
  "37843": "Is it long since you saw her?",
  "37844": "Might I ask you a question or two?",
  "37845": "And must not an animal be a lover of learning who determines what he likes and dislikes by the test of knowledge and ignorance?",
  "37846": "Do you mean an old beau of hers?",
  "37847": "And how am I to get back?",
  "37848": "Will I join thy band?",
  "37849": "Do you consider him in present danger, sir?",
  "37850": "And what did you do?",
  "37851": "When do they get up?",
  "37852": "Isn't the sea wonderful?",
  "37853": "How comes it, father, that you treat me thus?",
  "37854": "How did tha' like th' seeds an' th' garden tools?",
  "37855": "But when?",
  "37856": "On the other and more friendly side, was it true that the vexatious passport system had been abrogated?",
  "37857": "What do you wish me to explain?",
  "37858": "What can you see?",
  "37859": "Have you really committed the crimes of which you are accused?",
  "37860": "Was it not honestly a trial to listen to an argument such as that?",
  "37861": "May he not come up here?",
  "37862": "And why is it your mother's opinion?",
  "37863": "Experience?",
  "37864": "Reform the constitution?",
  "37865": "Well, sir, and what then?",
  "37866": "How can I describe it?",
  "37867": "Jack's as good as his master, eh?",
  "37868": "Why, you are not going to leave us?",
  "37869": "Newson?",
  "37870": "Are you going to see him?",
  "37871": "Easy to do?",
  "37872": "She's very sweet, isn't she?",
  "37873": "Where, where is my uncle?",
  "37874": "John, are you acquainted with this subterranean passage?",
  "37875": "It is not too warm for you?",

  "37877": "Will I promise?",
  "37878": "Don't know?",
  "37879": "Esperance?",
  "37880": "Is it likely, if I have any project in hand that I ought to keep secret from you, I should tell you about it?",
  "37881": "And your name?",
  "37882": "He'll come to be scragged, won't he?",
  "37883": "What would he do, then?",
  "37884": "But do they know, at least, how to act circumspectly?",
  "37885": "Isn't she too young?",
  "37886": "Shall I live to get into it?",
  "37887": "Did you ever give him your promise, eh?",
  "37888": "Any affinity to wantonness and intemperance?",
  "37889": "What was to be done with the rebel armies when defeated?",
  "37890": "If he could not come himself, why, in the name of every thing rational, could he not have enclosed me a letter of presentation?",
  "37891": "What does that suggest to your mind?",
  "37892": "How shall I be sure that you will not compromise other persons equally unjustly?",
  "37893": "Shall I ask him to forgive me what I said yesterday?",
  "37894": "What do you say, my child?",
  "37895": "Why does she not come in?",
  "37896": "What thing?",
  "37897": "Is it really for love he is going to marry you?",
  "37898": "And why are they stopping?",
  "37899": "Where's the third?",
  "37900": "Daughters, where are ye?",
  "37901": "Now, I say, who are ye?",
  "37902": "What can this be?",
  "37903": "Could I ever have loved you, had I not known you better than you know yourself?",
  "37904": "Was a mere drudge to be employed?",
  "37905": "You have never gloated over me as the bird of prey gloats over the poor beast that is soon to become carrion beneath its claws?",
  "37906": "Do you suppose,' asked the second one, that you are the only living thing that craves with a hungry longing to hear the cuckoo's note again?",
  "37907": "But can you think of something else at this moment?",
  "37908": "A humourist too?",
  "37909": "What will she do?",
  "37910": "But your family have been with us for several generations, have they not?",
  "37911": "And you too?",
  "37912": "And from being a keeper of the law he is converted into a breaker of it?",
  "37913": "Or why not grow a few extra fancy strawberries in the well cultivated spots about these trees?",
  "37914": "Courage?",
  "37915": "For in what does your strength consist?",
  "37916": "Because experience must have told me that I'm universally pleasing?",

  "37924": "Thinks I you are a pretty blade, aint you?",
  "37925": "You're there, are you?",
  "37926": "Have you ever heard of any tutor whom you would prefer to another?",
  "37927": "Are you awake?",
  "37928": "But what do you allow that we should do about it?",
  "37929": "Well, what d'you say to it?",
  "37930": "But where in the world is she?",
  "37931": "May I play?",
  "37932": "Would he do it?",
  "37933": "Oh, do you?",
  "37934": "How can I talk to gentlemen when I do not know which of them have received gratifications and which have not?",

  "37947": "Why did he not do something?",
  "37948": "Hieronimo?",
  "37949": "What are you doing?",
  "37950": "And how did you localize me?",
  "37951": "But if the document is found?",
  "37952": "But might not his nomination be overruled?",
  "37953": "Who did it?",
  "37954": "Will you not telegraph again?",
  "37955": "What economy was that, monsieur?",
  "37956": "Do you mean leave him to HER?",
  "37957": "How could any duty bind her to hardness?",
  "37958": "How do you expect him to answer you all at once?",
  "37959": "Can any one who sets before himself the nature of the editor's task believe in him and it?",
  "37960": "Who is he, then?",
  "37961": "Then the intermediate state of rest will be pleasure and will also be pain?",
  "37962": "Had he established any data from which it would be possible to reckon what time must elapse before she would again approach the earth?",
  "37963": "What dances am I giving you next week?",
  "37964": "My father is not engaged in this fearful plot, is he, sir?",
  "37965": "But with what weapon?",
  "37966": "Can any one understand these things?",
  "37967": "How can you talk such nonsense?",
  "37968": "Why not take it just as it is and scatter it to the four winds?",
  "37969": "And you have come here with that purpose?",
  "37970": "May we all be welcome here?",
  "37971": "How's it you're not drunk today?",
  "37972": "What's next?",
  "37973": "What, a new coinage of your own?",
  "37974": "But is that essentially right, and proper, and honourable, or is it contemptibly mean and selfish?",
  "37975": "This was her garden, wasn't it?",
  "37976": "Only natural, eh?",
  "37977": "Am I, sir?",
  "37978": "Do you call this flat?",
  "37979": "And how many clever men?",
  "37980": "What's a falsehood?",

  "37982": "What do you suppose the gentleman did?",
  "37983": "Nothing bad has happened to him, then?",
  "37984": "You wouldn't shame him before his lass there?",
  "37985": "How could you?",

  "38395": "Who do YOU like best?",
  "38396": "To you first entering on life, to whom care is new and agony unknown, how can you understand what I have felt and still feel?",

  "38409": "Are you still aware what you have sworn to me?",
  "38410": "Why, where are your things?",
  "38411": "And this elixir, where is it?",
  "38412": "But what reason has she for being angry?",
  "38413": "What should ail me to harm this misbegotten and miserable babe?",
  "38414": "And he bowed to you like this?",
  "38415": "But what of the resemblance?",
  "38416": "Was it good for you?",

  "38425": "Why did we not find it sooner?",
  "38426": "A book in the library?",
  "38427": "Where do you live, young maid?",
  "38428": "Why not you step out of the narrow circle which, as I have shown, is all of noble life your laws and customs allow?",
  "38429": "Which way should I turn?",
  "38430": "Who else could hold you thus?",
  "38431": "What tricks?",

  "38477": "Has he got anything seriously the matter with him?",
  "38478": "Then why not make himself known at once?",
  "38479": "If he had liked his wife so much why did he hate her garden?",
  "38480": "Is it because LIBERTY implies it, or because property prohibits it?",
  "38481": "Have you quite forgot us poor critturs?",
  "38482": "Is it the old pain, my precious?",

  "38520": "What do you think?",
  "38521": "Still?",
  "38522": "And with the hearing, I said, we hear, and with the other senses perceive the other objects of sense?",
  "38523": "You mean to say that the people, from whom he has derived his being, will maintain him and his companions?",
  "38524": "One a fat sleek man?",
  "38525": "But why?",
  "38526": "How can such a person be the master of things?",
  "38527": "Ah, go away, dummy, how about the girls?",
  "38528": "But what does the dazzling day to the south conceal?",
  "38529": "Or something of that sort?",
  "38530": "Since I've been away?",

  "39605": "There, isn't that a fine boy?",
  "39606": "Why doth it grieve you nought?",
  "39607": "It missed him, then?",
  "39608": "We were very gay and sociable, and I asked him, in the course of conversation, what he was?",
  "39609": "I, madame, I?",
  "39610": "Are you quite sure he said that?",
  "39611": "Deteriorated, that is to say, in the good qualities of horses, not of dogs?",
  "39612": "You'll give me a teeny piece, won't you?",
  "39613": "Did my brother beat out the dogs?",
  "39614": "Why do you continually remind us of these facts?",
  "39615": "Did it burn down?",
  "39616": "Nobody coming here, I hope?",

  "39624": "Is it possible?",
  "39625": "Is there any need for you to be working?",
  "39626": "How can you consent to serve him if he's such a man as that?",
  "39627": "Very well, that is your opinion of her, but of me?",
  "39628": "What, then, would he do?",
  "39629": "My mistress?",
  "39630": "Is it far from here?",
  "39631": "Meet whom?",
  "39632": "What now?",

  "39711": "At th' head 'a th' reg'ment?",
  "39712": "Will you let me give it to you?",
  "39713": "All right and all wrong, don't they become synonymous, somewhere?",
  "39714": "When she first saw me, might she not be a little shocked and disappointed?",
  "39715": "But do you imagine that men who are unable to give and take a reason will have the knowledge which we require of them?",

  "39735": "You waited too, it seems?",
  "39736": "Where do I come from?",
  "39737": "Upon what subject?",
  "39738": "And whose fault was that?",
  "39739": "And what of that?",
  "39740": "Is this, then, yet another of them?",

  "39760": "It is finished, then?",
  "39761": "No writings in the cabin that might have told something of the lives of its original inmates?",
  "39762": "Yet had she misgivings?",
  "39763": "What was the good of getting up or going to bed now?",
  "39764": "But what is there that is perfect?",
  "39765": "Why did I refuse to marry him?",

  "39779": "Or what mean the tents down yonder?",
  "39780": "Can there be a more evident, a more direct proof of this than the digging of the grave beforehand?",
  "39781": "Did I know anything about it, when it was all done when I was down there?",
  "39782": "Would she go with me?",
  "39783": "Does their enmity pursue only me and him?",
  "39784": "Does he ever think of me?",
  "39785": "But won't it be rather difficult to arrange the two halves?",
  "39786": "And do you know how many grains one ear bears?",
  "39787": "Who indeed would think of compassioning a shadow?",
  "39788": "Where'd youse get it?",
  "39789": "Might I ask you why he made it?",
  "39790": "Did you not get away together?",
  "39791": "Why should HE have it more than anybody else?",
  "39792": "And pleased?",
  "39793": "What sort of scrape?",
  "39794": "What letter?",
  "39795": "And did I not myself warn you against it when I said that it was a deceiver, a lying and deceiving spirit?",
  "39796": "Why this strife of the chase?",
  "39797": "He had paid, hadn't he?",
  "39798": "Blond?",

  "39820": "You can't detach yourself?",
  "39821": "To love one's enemies?",
  "39822": "How did such graceful feathery things ever come to have such a dreadful name?",
  "39823": "Shall I tell you plainly one thing, sir?",
  "39824": "Reverse?",
  "39825": "Can I explain to them that which I so imperfectly understand, that which years of study may have made so plain to them?",
  "39826": "Tell me, what is it you want me to do?",
  "39827": "Like these in shape and size?",
  "39828": "But what is equality before the law?",
  "39829": "Any stuff you have in stock your best work?",
  "39830": "How can you justify your own being of a poet, that so slight all the old poets?",
  "39831": "You deduced it, then?",
  "39832": "And for what purpose am I now using it?",
  "39833": "Whence then was her mouth created?",
  "39834": "Swear that?",
  "39835": "Did it resist the pressure of the maelstrom?",
  "39836": "What is heavy?",
  "39837": "Is it really for us that you mean your attack?",

  "39840": "If we cannot understand him in his objective creatures, how then in his substantive moods and phases of creation?",
  "39841": "D'you feel ill?",
  "39842": "But couldn't it be part of the fifty pounds?",
  "39843": "What have you to fight with?",
  "39844": "Living or dead, where is she?",

  "39851": "Oh, that's it, is it?",
  "39852": "Would it not be well, therefore, for him to marry?",
  "39853": "Not heard from her?",
  "39854": "How could one, with a thirst for truth, and clear conviction, accept such historical evidence?",
  "39855": "What else should you call me?",
  "39856": "I shall see you tomorrow?",
  "39857": "You mean about your profession?",

  "39867": "How can I understand?",
  "39868": "What the devil's the matter?",
  "39869": "Have you done anything?",
  "39870": "Who can tell whether we shall not come across a human being?",
  "39871": "Why, is there anyone who doubts that those histories are false?",
  "39872": "What COULD the tastes of that man be who saw friendliness and geniality in these shaggy hills?",
  "39873": "Would not their track betray them?",
  "39874": "Is this true, what I see in the paper then?",
  "39875": "My house?",
  "39876": "And if I just sniff them to see whether they've really lost all their scent?",
  "39877": "What horses?",
  "39878": "Why had he got there before me?",
  "39879": "Whose death?",
  "39880": "You heard me ask her to be my wife?",
  "39881": "What family?",
  "39882": "How then could you at the behest of a paltry friar, silly, brutish and envious, bring yourself to deal with him in any harsh sort?",
  "39883": "How many sides have I?",
  "39884": "Then where do we lie?",
  "39885": "What will become of me?",
  "39886": "So father found you again, did he?",
  "39887": "And what is fifty miles of good road?",
  "39888": "Where are the rest of you going?",
  "39889": "What should happen me?",
  "39890": "Did you call?",
  "39891": "Could she have lied to him, and sworn that she did not love him?",
  "39892": "Why does that make you cry?",
  "39893": "You are still hard at work, I see?",
  "39894": "But tell me, count, will your people take care of my horse?",
  "39895": "May one ask what it is for?",
  "39896": "What, are the turtles fray'd out of their nests?",
  "39897": "Is it a suitable match?",
  "39898": "There are other windows, aren't there?",
  "39899": "You will permit me to make one remark?",

  "39906": "Been out?",
  "39907": "Why is it howling?",
  "39908": "Was he much unlike other folks?",
  "39909": "What do you mean, nephew?",
  "39910": "What shadow of pretence have ye now to produce for continuing the blasphemous fraud?",
  "39911": "I suppose no samurai may bet?",

  "39913": "Light, where's the book?",
  "39914": "She's not going?",
  "39915": "What is the matter, little fellow?",
  "39916": "Why should I want a lawyer?",
  "39917": "And what has this young life been ruined for?",
  "39918": "Do you really think it's possible?",
  "39919": "Do you think you are frightening me?",
  "39920": "Did he ever hear anything of the ruined city or the caves?",
  "39921": "Surely you will not do anything so foolish?",
  "39922": "Is that your boy?",
  "39923": "And what is my name?",
  "39924": "But this place is further still?",
  "39925": "Who was your father?",
  "39926": "Dear heart, is it time?",
  "39927": "Then who is that confronts us?",
  "39928": "The laws?",
  "39929": "Why then should I hesitate a moment for a superb cloak of scarlet?",
  "39930": "What do you watch me for?",
  "39931": "Was it because she knew it would touch a tender corner of his heart?",
  "39932": "Did you ever hear any one else but your folks, ax whether a dose of medicine would pay when it was given to save life?",
  "39933": "Why was she brought here among us?",
  "39934": "Where's a company's pocket?",

  "39948": "Do you leave all the other arrangements in our hands?",
  "39949": "Have you understood me?",
  "39950": "What other mass is there which moves so much like one man?",
  "39951": "Is it just sentimentality, old wives' tales, or is she right?",
  "39952": "Meg, not anything wrong with you?",
  "39953": "How can you talk such nonsense?",
  "39954": "A trade?",
  "39955": "How can we heartily obey one who is but a foreigner with the accident of an identical language?",
  "39956": "Do you think I look so easy quenched with the tap of a loy?",
  "39957": "Cyaxares means to kidnap them, doesn't he?",
  "39958": "And why?",
  "39959": "The king?",

  "39968": "You think that I ought not to see her?",
  "39969": "Ah, truly?",
  "39970": "But what's the use of talking?",
  "39971": "Why the hell didn't you say so before?",
  "39972": "How's the show going?",
  "39973": "Shall we not be justified if we say that the end of physical evolution is the attainment of the perfection of animal form?",

  "39990": "How mean you, sir, pass upon me?",
  "39991": "You mean about the man?",
  "39992": "Do you think that possible?",
  "39993": "And what do they say then?",
  "39994": "But are you under the impression that men ever do anything except for selfish reasons?",
  "39995": "Why do you ask me?",
  "39996": "What is that scratch upon the face of it?",
  "39997": "O dearest, dear sir, said I, have you nothing more to honour me with?",
  "39998": "What has he to say to his readers?",
  "39999": "Nay, good captain, will you regard the humour of a fool?",
  "40000": "Do you mean to say neither of you know your own numbers?",
  "40001": "And grandpapa?",
  "40002": "Perhaps she thinks you share those opinions, and for that reason won't marry you?",
  "40003": "Like some supper?",
  "40004": "And all those people?",
  "40005": "Guardian, you don't think it possible that he is justly accused?",
  "40006": "Did I go so far as that?",
  "40007": "Are they all still at breakfast?",
  "40008": "But what did you know of my intentions?",
  "40009": "What is the latest news of the ruffian?",
  "40010": "Then why did you hide them?",
  "40011": "Won't you smoke?",
  "40012": "Are you upon a wager?",
  "40013": "What's a pity?",
  "40014": "What 're you alassin' about?",
  "40015": "I am to die on the day after the arrival of the ship?",
  "40016": "Is the mother living?",
  "40017": "Speak, shall I have 'em, sir?",
  "40018": "Well, what do you wish me to say to you?",
  "40019": "Love isn't good enough for you?",
  "40020": "Followed by a lackey?",
  "40021": "But why have you not fled?",
  "40022": "What do you mean by it?",
  "40023": "How can you shut your eyes and ears?",
  "40024": "May I write to him and say that you will go?",
  "40025": "Where the devil have you been?",
  "40026": "Is he pleased with you?",
  "40027": "Are there engagements to the performance of which we are held by every tie respectable among men?",
  "40028": "Are you hungry, child?",
  "40029": "Could it be that the thread was leading him home to his mother's cottage?",
  "40030": "What would you be doing?",
  "40031": "And what is the third source from which each of them sought for help against pressing danger?",
  "40032": "Have you invented a plan for keeping the hair from being blown off?",
  "40033": "Is he tall or short?",
  "40034": "Is not a man to have any reward?",
  "40035": "Aren't you sometimes frightened at being planted out here, with nobody to take care of you?",
  "40036": "Now, the question is, what price would you ask for it?",
  "40037": "Why is he on his knees?",
  "40038": "I am ugly enough, aren't I?",
  "40039": "Were you making that dusty light I saw by now?",
  "40040": "Have you ever been here in your life before?",
  "40041": "Hold your tongue, will you?",
  "40042": "And how dare you bring it here, sir?",
  "40043": "What way?",
  "40044": "Whatever are you bothering about, gentlemen?",
  "40045": "Does he think I'm a fool?",
  "40046": "And why do you accuse me of such dissimulation?",
  "40047": "Disease?",
  "40048": "Wot's the good of the lady a fretting herself?",
  "40049": "And amidst the intricacies of rank how is it possible for woman to learn and to remember everything?",
  "40050": "Where did this come from?",
  "40051": "Is not your son a scholar, sir?",
  "40052": "Will you do something for me?",
  "40053": "Pretend?",
  "40054": "And it is to this man that you raise a memorial?",
  "40055": "See that light among the trees?",
  "40056": "Are they, my dear?",
  "40057": "And your point is that they're not doing so?",
  "40058": "What recks it them?",
  "40059": "Did he teach you?",
  "40060": "Have you brought your arms?",
  "40061": "Where, now, is that mighty host?",
  "40062": "What do you say now?",
  "40063": "Should he leave these reasonably comfortable quarters and fly from this inscrutable horror?",
  "40064": "What kind of cloth is it?",
  "40065": "Do I read your lesson aright?",
  "40066": "What did you next see?",
  "40067": "Do you want me to go and tell him?",
  "40068": "Do you not know me?",
  "40069": "But where is her real happiness, I might say her lasting happiness?",
  "40070": "What are we to do about it?",
  "40071": "How DARE you make such a mess, you little devils?",
  "40072": "To get away from me as far as you could?",
  "40073": "After all, what is it?",
  "40074": "You've had all my letters, haven't you?",
  "40075": "Isn't it all panning out beautifully?",
  "40076": "Now, what styptics, what antiphiogistics ought to be employed?",
  "40077": "What do you think we should do next?",
  "40078": "Have you no prettier books?",
  "40079": "You will not go barefoot?",
  "40080": "A fire?",
  "40081": "Is he a rascal?",
  "40082": "And have you never tried to understand them?",
  "40083": "What could that sense have been?",
  "40084": "What more will you say?",
  "40085": "Have we fo'gotten the waising of the militia in the yeah 'seven?",
  "40086": "Had the ingenuity of the constructors of the projectile obtained any happy result?",
  "40087": "I say, brother, how is my mother to be got to scratch me?",
  "40088": "Have I travelled in that country?",
  "40089": "Why don't you speak?",
  "40090": "For your safety?",
  "40091": "Of shall I ring the bell?",
  "40092": "Oh, they won't mind, will they?",
  "40093": "How far is it to any town or village?",
  "40094": "Did you know him?",
  "40095": "What does this signify?",
  "40096": "What did I know?",
  "40097": "In what part of them are we?",
  "40098": "Ain't that sensible?",
  "40099": "What was it here?",
  "40100": "Is this, is this your joy?",
  "40101": "Was she dead?",
  "40102": "What is he bawling about?",
  "40103": "Has it, sir?",
  "40104": "No matter?",
  "40105": "What was there left for him to do?",
  "40106": "See her myself?",
  "40107": "Your name, please?",
  "40108": "Who's going to give it?",
  "40109": "And in the laying of bricks and stones is the just man a more useful or better partner than the builder?",
  "40110": "Isn't this rather sudden?",
  "40111": "Do they know about it?",
  "40112": "ARE you to get in at all?",
  "40113": "Skimpole, is it?",
  "40114": "Where's yer five shillings?",
  "40115": "Was he young or old, healthy or sickly, tractable or rebellious?",
  "40116": "What have I done, then?",
  "40117": "Your four pair of stockings, one silk, three worsted?",
  "40118": "Who could have foreseen such a terrible catastrophe?",
  "40119": "Didn't you say that you have sent him money?",
  "40120": "Where in your world have you seen papers like this?",
  "40121": "Will the queen deign to follow my advice?",
  "40122": "Surely you don't really imagine that he may be kidnapped in order to give information against his wealthy uncle?",
  "40123": "What did you please to say, sir?",
  "40124": "Which is the child?",
  "40125": "And are we two the only folk here?",
  "40126": "Dear guardian, how could I object to your writing anything for ME to read?",
  "40127": "How's this passage of yours going to help us?",
  "40128": "You have no occasion to come here to learn that, I suppose?",
  "40129": "It's hell these days, ain't it?",
  "40130": "Brabazon?",
  "40131": "And do you like it here?",
  "40132": "Shall we settle ourselves here?",
  "40133": "But of what consequence is the subject?",
  "40134": "Yes, dear?",
  "40135": "Do you mean to say that she does not love me?",
  "40136": "What do you say of this, for example?",
  "40137": "Was she full of them when you saw her?",
  "40138": "And for the whole day?",
  "40139": "Not go as I have said?",
  "40140": "Will that suffice?",
  "40141": "How could you know anything of the matter?",
  "40142": "What body?",
  "40143": "What do you know against him?",
  "40144": "Who could help laughing at a king hunkering on a branch and his army roosting around him like hens?",
  "40145": "Have you seen a pimp outface his own wants better?",
  "40146": "Where is she?",
  "40147": "How can one expect it?",
  "40148": "Where's the kid?",
  "40149": "My father?",
  "40150": "Don't little boys like little girls?",
  "40151": "Is there an answer?",
  "40152": "I only wish to know whether you will employ this courage for your queen?",
  "40153": "Aren't you sure?",
  "40154": "What are hysterics?",
  "40155": "Were you ever there, my lord?",
  "40156": "But what are the relations, I ask, of which you here talk?",
  "40157": "But could you not compromise matters, and give up a portion of your fortune to her son?",
  "40158": "Well, what conclusion have you reached?",
  "40159": "My father, what is this you crave?",
  "40160": "How do you feel, my dear?",
  "40161": "Your daughter?",
  "40162": "What in the world has happened?",
  "40163": "Can you give me any circumstances or particulars?",
  "40164": "What was he waiting for?",
  "40165": "Is it good news?",
  "40166": "Besides, what object could the creature have for this extraordinary deception?",
  "40167": "Cut?",
  "40168": "But are you SURE?",
  "40169": "Shall we see you tomorrow to dinner?",
  "40170": "You live in their milieu?",
  "40171": "What have I to strive and toil for?",
  "40172": "And will you call it being against you, if the queen does not choose you for her confessor?",
  "40173": "Oh, that's this missionary?",
  "40174": "Will you disclose the whole?",
  "40175": "What's all this fuss?",
  "40176": "What ails you?",
  "40177": "How shall I moil 'em?",
  "40178": "What, then, is the alternative?",
  "40179": "What could sadden him thus?",
  "40180": "But could he trust himself?",
  "40181": "Is this country good for cattle?",
  "40182": "What say I?",
  "40183": "Why did they lure me there?",
  "40184": "Does he say that, papa?",
  "40185": "Do you not think that, as a daughter, I am right?",
  "40186": "How shall I go about in quest of a wight whom I know not and whom, if I saw him face to face, I should not know?",
  "40187": "Are you trying to, play pranks on an old man?",
  "40188": "Their virtue, their justice, their power?",
  "40189": "What honor has the khansamah?",
  "40190": "What, always the same ditty?",
  "40191": "Will you take advantage of this reconciliation to put down or restrain me?",
  "40192": "Can sowing begin?",
  "40193": "How am I duped?",
  "40194": "Where in this vicinity will you go and not meet some monument to inspire such sentiments?",
  "40195": "Right?",
  "40196": "And how's your friend, sir?",
  "40197": "Who are you angry with?",
  "40198": "Got stung, I daresay?",
  "40199": "And where is he now?",
  "40200": "Yes, what makes you ask?",
  "40201": "Shall we go into dinner?",
  "40202": "How did you hear that?",
  "40203": "Lynde?",
  "40204": "For of what use would this precaution be, if there were nothing to gain by it?",
  "40205": "Was she now to be as light, as foolish, as easy, as in those former days from which she had learned her wisdom?",
  "40206": "Do you think it will do?",
  "40207": "Is he glad of it or not?",
  "40208": "Do you mean to say, you don't mind how you die?",
  "40209": "Oh, what can I do for him?",
  "40210": "And how shall I travel, then?",
  "40211": "Oh, you agree, do you?",
  "40212": "Was he by himself?",
  "40213": "And what is it you'll say to me, and I after doing it this time in the face of all?",
  "40214": "And who's he?",
  "40215": "Does it interest you?",
  "40216": "What, my horse?",
  "40217": "But suppose he ISN'T honourable?",
  "40218": "Then he was certainly there?",
  "40219": "Surely your wife knew?",
  "40220": "Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?",
  "40221": "What is the reason of this sudden call?",
  "40222": "Do I find a fault, and nobody repairs it?",
  "40223": "Cried I, who carrieth his ashes unto the mountain?",
  "40224": "Is it a simple matter to keep silence?",
  "40225": "You have no faith in me?",
  "40226": "Is it any wonder that it rests with us now, with a bewildering sense of some power outside ourselves or our comprehension?",
  "40227": "How can you single out angels from among devils?",
  "40228": "Is it so very bad?",
  "40229": "Does that hurt you in any way?",
  "40230": "Shall I send the father to you?",
  "40231": "Are you quite alone, this year?",
  "40232": "Have I not given you to understand that, for a while at least, I would prefer to keep the contents of this epistle to myself?",
  "40233": "Can you say so?",
  "40234": "None of ye has been stealing what didn't belong to him?",
  "40235": "And here he proposed articles to you, I understand?",
  "40236": "The slab which closes the vault?",
  "40237": "How are matches made, except by bringing men and women together?",
  "40238": "Well, anyway, what ARE we going to do?",
  "40239": "But who is to carry you, said she, to your father and mother?",
  "40240": "You have nothing more to say?",
  "40241": "Who counsels best?",
  "40242": "What's the best place to stay at for the night round here?",
  "40243": "But whether made by one side or the other, would each side enjoy equal advantages on the trial?",
  "40244": "Not fear of the thunder, surely?",
  "40245": "Do you know he is a convict, a felon, a common thief?",
  "40246": "Who should know if I don't?",
  "40247": "For what do they commemorate as concerns you and myself?",
  "40248": "Meaning that you saw none?",
  "40249": "Work?",
  "40250": "Were you much hurt?",
  "40251": "Do you still think you found somebody fairer?",
  "40252": "Did he steal?",
  "40253": "Doesn't he feel important?",
  "40254": "What stage have they reached, sir?",
  "40255": "Will no one come?",
  "40256": "Well, what?",
  "40257": "Had he a whip in his hand?",
  "40258": "When was there ever a time when he had experienced happiness, felt a true bliss?",
  "40259": "He hadn't any money, had he?",
  "40260": "But can you not say that, sir?",
  "40261": "Why should I go back?",
  "40262": "Do you know what he did, sir?",
  "40263": "How far now can this negative mode of proceeding be carried?",
  "40264": "Why should you?",
  "40265": "And do you see that other one, who has an eagle and a dragon painted side by side upon his shield?",
  "40266": "Whence then was thy back created?",
  "40267": "Can I speak plainer?",
  "40268": "Who sent it?",
  "40269": "Will not a small body and a large one float the same way under the same influence?",
  "40270": "Can you give us any reason why we should not put you to death?",
  "40271": "Why had no word of any kind come from him?",
  "40272": "Made by whom?",
  "40273": "Have blows passed?",
  "40274": "And why was I so furious about it?",
  "40275": "Now, who was that someone?",
  "40276": "Who told you so?",
  "40277": "And can't we have a good time, too?",
  "40278": "How long is this thing going on like this?",
  "40279": "How much did it cost him?",
  "40280": "How are we today?",
  "40281": "Need I recall either the scene or the national circumstances attending the occasion?",
  "40282": "You're ready, are you?",
  "40283": "Of whom speak you?",
  "40284": "Do you know?",
  "40285": "What am I saying?",
  "40286": "Might not that influence be altogether disastrous?",
  "40287": "What shall I say of this man?",
  "40288": "Why don't you go on?",
  "40289": "Is it not the impiety of the inhabitants?",
  "40290": "Was he carrying a hat?",
  "40291": "Wasn't it, my wife?",
  "40292": "Can't you see you've wiped out everything?",
  "40293": "And the lustful and tyrannical desires are, as we saw, at the greatest distance?",
  "40294": "Who's there?",
  "40295": "When do you desire to go?",
  "40296": "The associate?",
  "40297": "But to whom, then?",
  "40298": "You feel strong enough to walk a little way now?",
  "40299": "What odds in that?",
  "40300": "And do you imagine he realizes all the awfulness of my position?",
  "40301": "Is the world, then, so narrow?",
  "40302": "Didn't you know that?",
  "40303": "When did music come this way?",
  "40304": "And what means have you to suggest, may I ask?",
  "40305": "What have we here?",
  "40306": "A spy?",
  "40307": "What are you worrying for, so long as he has money?",
  "40308": "Why did you ask me?",
  "40309": "What did these sealed mysterious letters bring him?",
  "40310": "How long will it take you to make up your mind?",
  "40311": "How of the window?",
  "40312": "And what did she for you?",
  "40313": "Well, how is your district council doing?",
  "40314": "Ought we not, then, to put our virtue and fortitude to the severest tests?",
  "40315": "May you come to me?",
  "40316": "What was his affair?",
  "40317": "Are you a magician?",
  "40318": "How long is it?",
  "40319": "Should you think all that pleasant enough if I forgave you?",
  "40320": "Were not these madmen common enough in such a prison?",
  "40321": "Of HIM?",
  "40322": "Where yeh hit?",
  "40323": "Is he hurt badly?",
  "40324": "What the devil is it all about?",
  "40325": "Does he now say that he did not make that promise?",
  "40326": "What was his name?",
  "40327": "Ferguson?",
  "40328": "Can it be that he was ashamed of me?",
  "40329": "Is it true, mother?",
  "40330": "Whither?",
  "40331": "But you prefer playing other people's accompaniments, to singing yourself, don't you?",
  "40332": "Shall I open the secretary?",
  "40333": "In what respect, madame?",
  "40334": "But what is an energumen?",
  "40335": "Who is it bids me hold?",
  "40336": "May I ask where you have taken up your quarters?",
  "40337": "Or, indeed, I might perhaps get a clerkship in a merchant's office?",
  "40338": "Are you a merchant?",
  "40339": "What injury?",
  "40340": "Did I startle you?",
  "40341": "The horse?",
  "40342": "Where did you get THAT idea from?",
  "40343": "Have you ever seen a man hanged?",
  "40344": "Not even your aunt?",
  "40345": "Why did you not tell me?",
  "40346": "Do you recall her features distinctly?",
  "40347": "At such a tender age could he have been conscious of his uncle's superiority to all those who surrounded him?",
  "40348": "She had a son, that unhappy woman?",
  "40349": "What was the occasion of this excited assemblage?",
  "40350": "But at a tremendous discount, of course?",
  "40351": "You wish to speak to me about the circumstance which has just happened?",
  "40352": "Was I not just telling you I despised it?",
  "40353": "How has this been proved?",
  "40354": "Do you mind?",
  "40355": "What does it say?",
  "40356": "Then this table is free?",
  "40357": "Who raised the money?",
  "40358": "And what might you think?",
  "40359": "Perhaps you dislike it?",
  "40360": "You see all these bags at the back of my cart?",
  "40361": "Whether they were a rich or a poor corporation?",
  "40362": "And how does he behave towards travellers?",
  "40363": "Have you kept in touch with the market while you have been out of work?",
  "40364": "I then asked him what he intended to do with the knife which had been found upon him?",
  "40365": "Have you ever noticed how much a thing is heightened in value when we obtain possession of it?",
  "40366": "I wish it would snow, don't you?",
  "40367": "But why should he go through the ceremony if he is not to live with her?",
  "40368": "Oh, is that it?",
  "40369": "I do not know?",
  "40370": "And how could he know that I should be such a simpleton as to believe him?",
  "40371": "Are you so unsociable that you cannot make friends?",
  "40372": "Repeal this statute, my good sir?",
  "40373": "Will you make up your mind at last?",
  "40374": "Do I not know human nature?",
  "40375": "Must I wrap them up?",
  "40376": "Why fear these titles, why this chieftain's strength?",
  "40377": "If he was going to treat her like that why did he ask her to come and live at the flat?",
  "40378": "But how can I send him away, since I have given him a rendezvous?",
  "40379": "H'm?",
  "40380": "Ever so far?",
  "40381": "What are you doing there?",
  "40382": "And how have I broken that treaty, your excellency?",
  "40383": "How are you, old fellow?",
  "40384": "Sister?",
  "40385": "No misfortune has happened to the queen?",
  "40386": "You advise me, then, to be reconciled to the abbe?",
  "40387": "You too come to see them off?",
  "40388": "What is the meaning of yonder singular building?",
  "40389": "Have you brought his indentures with you?",
  "40390": "From whence, then, came this prostration?",
  "40391": "Is not ambition but an endless ladder by which no height is ever climbed till the last unreachable rung is mounted?",
  "40392": "Are you staying to talk?",
  "40393": "In what relation must she salute you as her uncle, or as her husband?",
  "40394": "Do the races or species of men, whichever term may be applied, encroach on and replace one another, so that some finally become extinct?",

  "40798": "No what?",
  "40799": "But why not up to now?",
  "40800": "What could be his intentions towards him?",
  "40801": "Was it well done, sir, if you're upon that subject, to deliver what I entrusted to yourself, to the care of another sir?",
  "40802": "Alas, was THIS perhaps the higher man whose cry I heard?",
  "40803": "Heah him crowin' now?",
  "40804": "But how did you find your way to me?",
  "40805": "And have no doubt searched all the huts until you came to this one?",
  "40806": "Do you possess this knowledge?",
  "40807": "I often told you that?",
  "40808": "What can have induced him to behave so cruelly?",

  "40815": "What shall I do with it?",
  "40816": "About myself, sir?",
  "40817": "Is she the same that I left her?",
  "40818": "And the chausses?",
  "40819": "Or if it had, what then?",
  "40820": "Will that happy time ever return?",
  "40821": "Shall I ever have the courage to carry it through?",
  "40822": "Was it politics, then, or was it a woman?",
  "40823": "Well, my dear, what are you doing here?",
  "40824": "Am I to suppose that this capricious tone is serious?",

  "40836": "But how can it be done?",
  "40837": "Who shall say?",
  "40838": "And who are the rest of them?",

  "40845": "Why should I not die if I wish?",
  "40846": "Is there anything else?",
  "40847": "Was it giddiness, or worse still, suffocation, caused by the high temperature?",
  "40848": "Is it far in the cave?",
  "40849": "But what do you want of one?",
  "40850": "That is some distance away?",
  "40851": "Am I about to do it?",
  "40852": "Is not to have lost the truth an evil, and to possess the truth a good?",

  "40861": "When did you say you paid this call?",
  "40862": "You quite understand?",
  "40863": "Got any supper for a hungry man?",
  "40864": "What would you do to me?",
  "40865": "Why these churches and this singing and this humbug?",
  "40866": "Why do you speak in such a strange way?",
  "40867": "So, where, where was it?",
  "40868": "And you would like your boy's to be the same?",
  "40869": "Before the music or after?",
  "40870": "Why have I never taken part in a review?",
  "40871": "Wherefore should I beware?",
  "40872": "Is it true what the servant man said?",
  "40873": "Don't you see the general wants to pass?",
  "40874": "Did you do it on your own responsibility?",
  "40875": "Will you have gold or silver?",
  "40876": "Should I not appear a most arrogant and shallow coxcomb if I gravely represented that there was any danger of her falling in love with me?",

  "40878": "What does it mean to my future?",
  "40879": "What boots it to say more?",
  "40880": "Now is there, then, no kind of oil which is capable of diminishing this friction?",
  "40881": "You have seen the stranger?",
  "40882": "Banns will do?",
  "40883": "And by whom was your wife abducted?",
  "40884": "Could you tell me to do so?",
  "40885": "What name, then, shall we give to the darkness of hell which is to last not for three days alone but for all eternity?",

  "40887": "Have a wife?",
  "40888": "What sort of a lie was the lie, master?",
  "40889": "Do you see me today?",
  "40890": "Who else could lay it there save you or me?",
  "40891": "Why would they not be gone?",
  "40892": "Or, after all, they may be in the right, and poets do really know the things about which they seem to the many to speak so well?",
  "40893": "But would any of your guardians think or speak of any other guardian as a stranger?",
  "40894": "Do you see here this little bunch, to which they are going to give t'other wrench?",
  "40895": "Mustn't he be made to do as I ask him?",
  "40896": "What do you know about it?",
  "40897": "What wouldst have?",
  "40898": "Why, by your silence, have you unchained egoism within me?",
  "40899": "Then why are you so ruffled?",
  "40900": "And why no arrest?",
  "40901": "Where did you get that scratch?",

  "40903": "But what do you suppose you are in the world for?",
  "40904": "Snivelling again?",
  "40905": "Three good suits, say you?",
  "40906": "Nor the general?",
  "40907": "Mina, dear what is it?",
  "40908": "How long is it now before daylight?",
  "40909": "Do you know what is done then?",
  "40910": "Is it a volcano?",
  "40911": "Have you been to look at the pictures?",
  "40912": "I do not think that this counting is constitutionally essential to the election, but how are we to proceed in the absence of it?",
  "40913": "These things happened so often at balls, and why not by the morning light, when the complexion showed all the better for it?",
  "40914": "You won't mind staying here alone while I'm away, will you?",
  "40915": "Then you turn me away?",
  "40916": "Do you keep a journal?",

  "40929": "How long did the queen remain out of the chamber?",
  "40930": "Do you accept the bargain?",
  "40931": "And we have admitted, I said, that the good of each art is specially confined to the art?",
  "40932": "And you think there was something of this sort here, do you?",
  "40933": "And she became what you called your wife?",
  "40934": "Can you blo' a harn?",
  "40935": "But what I want to know is, who shifted the carpet, and why?",
  "40936": "How on earth did you know that?",
  "40937": "Would you advise that the authority be given him?",
  "40938": "Well, and what do you think, friend?",
  "40939": "Won't you come in?",
  "40940": "Do you not think that it is expedient to show how utterly we disregard his judgment and her malice?",
  "40941": "If the trees at moonlight sang always so harmoniously?",
  "40942": "And what are those golden rocks like when you stand under them?",
  "40943": "Or perhaps they amuse your honor?",

  "40948": "If we should wish to retreat, how ought we to pursue?",
  "40949": "Have you washed your hands and face this morning?",
  "40950": "I wonder if the medicine has gone through the same channels in both?",
  "40951": "What are you crying for?",
  "40952": "Then the wit going toward him, asked him what he had got in his knapsack?",
  "40953": "Would you be so kind as see how 'tis?",
  "40954": "Is not all this obvious?",
  "40955": "These first warm days weaken one most remarkably, don't they?",
  "40956": "Why, what is the matter?",
  "40957": "Is it a heron or a swan?",
  "40958": "Either afield or here has he been seen?",

  "41003": "What be they?",
  "41004": "And as fickle?",
  "41005": "Do you know what that is?",
  "41006": "If you've been driven to the 'likes' of me, mayn't it show that you've felt truly forsaken?",
  "41007": "Was it indeed such spiritual guidance that was coming to me in my sleep?",
  "41008": "Are you going to spend your life saying ought, like the rest of our moralists?",
  "41009": "From what can it proceed?",
  "41010": "Whether he could go into the next street, and open a chemist's shop?",

  "41020": "How could I answer her arguments?",
  "41021": "Billie?",
  "41022": "And indeed, what is there in the idea of measuring, and consequently of fixing, value, that is unscientific?",

  "41092": "What then is the real object of them?",
  "41093": "Is there anything else you wish to retrench or alter, gentlemen?",
  "41094": "They say you played cards with her?",
  "41095": "Who is there who has not felt all these things?",
  "41096": "Is that all, monsieur?",
  "41097": "Is there any particular feeling on that head?",
  "41098": "Shooting, sir?",
  "41099": "Misgivings as to what?",
  "41100": "Make offerings?",
  "41101": "And when I tell you that it is my business, mine of right, does that go for nothing with you?",
  "41102": "And yet you were acknowledging a little while ago that knowledge is not the same as opinion?",
  "41103": "Do you not see that society is dissolving, that a spirit of infatuation is carrying us away?",
  "41104": "I say, doctor, you don't really think that I'm going to die?",
  "41105": "Well, it's very pleasant to have you back again, and you understand all about art now, eh?",

  "41112": "Can this be death?",
  "41113": "You have heard of her, I dare say?",
  "41114": "Did he tell you so?",
  "41115": "And does the end of the world frighten you?",
  "41116": "Eustacia?",
  "41117": "What is it you'll tell?",
  "41118": "You don't mean you've got the thread there?",
  "41119": "What is she thinking?",
  "41120": "Was it this voice, or at all like this voice?",
  "41121": "What was the question you put to the officer at the gate?",
  "41122": "What, then, was the change which now took place?",
  "41123": "Of what other things have you got hold?",
  "41124": "Do you take it for a printed book, you ignorant fool?",
  "41125": "How could you presume to come here on such an errand, you scoundrel?",
  "41126": "You have been in the habit now of reading to your father, and those people I found you among, I dare say?",
  "41127": "What earthly right have you to use such language to me?",
  "41128": "And now what is their manner of life, and what sort of a government have they?",
  "41129": "And that one?",
  "41130": "And if we refuse?",
  "41131": "You will be very much pleased, won't you, sir?",

  "41141": "You don't like playing, then?",
  "41142": "Should they have any milk?",
  "41143": "Fix'd in the heart, how can the heart forget her?",
  "41144": "That young man who was to be burned yesterday, was your son?",
  "41145": "Who can help it?",
  "41146": "How far off?",
  "41147": "For the misplaced expression?",
  "41148": "You have tied him up well, hein?",
  "41149": "Where got you that wit?",
  "41150": "Then why have you not sung before?",
  "41151": "You hear?",

  "41168": "What are they, your excellency ?",
  "41169": "Who could tell what the future might have in reserve?",
  "41170": "But how get married?",
  "41171": "Between them?",
  "41172": "Danger?",
  "41173": "Is not the wall built strong enough, and is not the tower sufficiently strong and high?",
  "41174": "What is it you are saying?",
  "41175": "Do you think he remembers me?",
  "41176": "Now, are we narrowing it down, or aren't we?",
  "41177": "My niece is not with you by any chance?",
  "41178": "What could I hardly be expected to undergo?",
  "41179": "Now, what must I give you to agree to this?",
  "41180": "Is it enough?",

  "43584": "One of them is ready to follow the guidance of the law?",
  "43585": "Perhaps you would help father?",
  "43586": "Who calls me aunt?",
  "43587": "And what was the cause of this riot?",
  "43588": "How many exiles?",
  "43589": "And if they laid you under a ban for adhering to me?",
  "43590": "Is he weaker?",
  "43591": "Are they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit stains, or what are they?",
  "43592": "What does mere food matter?",
  "43593": "Won't you give the answer yourself?",
  "43594": "Will your honor give any orders respecting this gentleman?",
  "43595": "Will that zatusfy you?",

  "43597": "So you've popped over, eh?",
  "43598": "Is he not delightful?",
  "43599": "What am I to do, sir?",
  "43600": "What shall I confess?",
  "43601": "Who was that grandfather?",
  "43602": "That wasn't very manly of him, was it?",
  "43603": "Will you have some tea?",
  "43604": "Is it excessive?",
  "43605": "But whom do you want?",
  "43606": "Did you ever hear tell the like o' that?",
  "43607": "What, could he, whose sphere was in great cities, be seeking in the wilderness?",
  "43608": "What is the dear fellow doing now?",
  "43609": "Did you speak to me, sir?",
  "43610": "Do you carry the names of all the gun makers in the world in your memory?",
  "43611": "Benedetto the count's son?",
  "43612": "Ours?",
  "43613": "Just for the fun of the thing?",

  "43616": "You'll get there in time?",
  "43617": "Am I not independent?",
  "43618": "Don't make any of your abrupt remarks, or do anything odd, will you?",
  "43619": "What have I done to you, to be so persecuted?",
  "43620": "Who's one to say it to?",
  "43621": "Had you no answer for him?",

  "43647": "Who do you mean?",
  "43648": "Is my brother safe?",
  "43649": "But wouldn't it be better to prevent my coming in contact with them, or their master?",
  "43650": "Have I done all this waiting for nothing?",
  "43651": "Was it quite safe when the winder shook?",
  "43652": "When do you go off?",
  "43653": "Has morning come already?",
  "43654": "My lord has, perhaps, no faith in those words?",

  "43664": "Valentine, would you rather denounce your stepmother?",
  "43665": "No mineral?",
  "43666": "Now?",
  "43667": "What o' that?",
  "43668": "And what good does it do to know him?",
  "43669": "Was he wrong?",
  "43670": "Why, what do ye think ye are?",
  "43671": "Do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?",
  "43672": "Will you take them?",
  "43673": "I ask you if you ever felt love towards anyone or anything?",
  "43674": "Are you a railroad man?",
  "43675": "Well, what in the nation do they call it the MUMPS for?",
  "43676": "Why had I permitted the rapid development of new situations to efface the recollection of that menacing danger?",
  "43677": "And who is this man?",
  "43678": "Died he by act of heaven and painlessly?",
  "43679": "And yet how was he to set about vindicating himself?",
  "43680": "Do you think the sisters who loved her so well, would have grieved the less if her life had been one of gloom and sadness?",
  "43681": "How are YOU?",
  "43682": "Do you know how he succeeded so well?",
  "43683": "The same party?",
  "43684": "And you will be glad to see me when I am back?",
  "43685": "In what relation did he stand to his century?",
  "43686": "How long have we been married?",
  "43687": "Shall I send one of the women for you?",
  "43688": "What is your reason for saying so?",
  "43689": "How long are you going on defying me like this?",
  "43690": "We'll change over, shall we?",
  "43691": "Where be they?",
  "43692": "How can you be sure?",
  "43693": "Surely she can hear him?",
  "43694": "Did you, for example, happen to hear someone, a woman I think, sobbing in the night?",
  "43695": "What ought I to do?",
  "43696": "And what may a myth be?",
  "43697": "Serpuhovskoy?",
  "43698": "The question is, was there any reality and truth in your feelings?",
  "43699": "Is there a creature in the whole country but ourselves, that does not take a trip to town now and then, to rub off the rust a little?",
  "43700": "Can you give me a few minutes' hearing, please?",
  "43701": "And you promised?",
  "43702": "Dad fetch it, how is I gwyne to dream all dat in ten minutes?",
  "43703": "What do you mean?",

  "43705": "You mean to keep that, don't you?",
  "43706": "Will you come and see me?",
  "43707": "Hard luck, wasn't it?",
  "43708": "You are acquainted with her?",
  "43709": "What was your employment?",
  "43710": "But is it true, as I am told, that she is so angry with you that she has publicly refused to speak with you?",
  "43711": "My money, sir?",
  "43712": "And how could she have a love letter from him in her hand?",
  "43713": "It was natural to ask, whence come these manifestations?",
  "43714": "You know them likewise?",
  "43715": "Has she told you so?",
  "43716": "To what sources, then, shall we turn?",
  "43717": "What was to happen then?",
  "43718": "Where else should I go to?",
  "43719": "I am no longer a musketeer, am I?",
  "43720": "Hadn't we better be moving?",
  "43721": "What are you sharpening?",
  "43722": "Do you know what I touch here?",
  "43723": "Did you tell her where I had seen her?",
  "43724": "Instantly, will you not?",
  "43725": "How far do I call it?",
  "43726": "We and they, are we not still the same men?",
  "43727": "Is our world gone?",
  "43728": "I guessed at his question presently, namely, whether I was sure I was not with child?",
  "43729": "Oh, what will tomorrow bring to us?",
  "43730": "Is it the women's ward you want to go to?",
  "43731": "And what is cement?",
  "43732": "What is needed for success in warfare?",
  "43733": "Will you consent to that?",
  "43734": "In what fashion?",
  "43735": "In time?",
  "43736": "Your father brings you up rather strictly?",
  "43737": "Where you goin' t' sleep?",
  "43738": "And what are they all about?",
  "43739": "What makes you think that, sir?",
  "43740": "Why should there be none?",
  "43741": "And half a million last week, wasn't it?",
  "43742": "Have they any fortune?",
  "43743": "Yes, but why?",
  "43744": "What will it signify to make your will now?",
  "43745": "That is so, father, is it not?",

  "43747": "What could she do now?",
  "43748": "May we then infer that man became divested of hair from having aboriginally inhabited some tropical land?",
  "43749": "And you have seen him?",
  "43750": "Don't you see that they're condemning him for the very reason for which they acquit everybody else?",
  "43751": "Lovely?",

  "43770": "If you had such, would you like to go to them?",
  "43771": "Reg'lar starved out, hey?",
  "43772": "Did you know that, or not?",
  "43773": "Will your majesty be pleased to conclude the feast?",
  "43774": "Isn't the breath of the mint delicious?",
  "43775": "She was nearer, but in what direction was she sailing?",
  "43776": "Vandemeyer?",
  "43777": "That's a slender amount for housekeeping, isn't it?",
  "43778": "You heard him speak of his files and of his wire jacket?",
  "43779": "But the contract?",
  "43780": "As a good neighbor, shall we not extend to her a helping hand to save her?",
  "43781": "What's your way?",
  "43782": "Do you know that I always work better after hearing the birds sing?",
  "43783": "Who is it who profits by it?",
  "43784": "Is this disappearance natural?",
  "43785": "D'ye hear me?",
  "43786": "How long, my father?",
  "43787": "All hearts?",
  "43788": "When such a fever fills the heart, what leach can make it whole?",

  "43793": "With robbing kitchens?",
  "43794": "You, is it?",
  "43795": "And then the queen?",
  "43796": "Would it matter?",

  "43822": "A flat nose?",
  "43823": "And when will that be?",
  "43824": "Off where?",
  "43825": "A quarrel already?",
  "43826": "But you don't dislike him, do you?",
  "43827": "Was that not desire?",
  "43828": "Can't you wait a little while yet?",
  "43829": "Why did n't they do it?",
  "43830": "Why not have kept him here among the rest, and made a sneaking, snivelling pickpocket of him at once?",
  "43831": "What would you?",
  "43832": "Arrow?",
  "43833": "Everything going all right?",
  "43834": "Yes, here it lies before me, but why is the deputation from the city so long in appearing?",

  "43848": "But what could it indicate?",
  "43849": "Why have you caused me thus to fail in my word towards a gentleman like the count, who has all our lives in his hands?",
  "43850": "Shall we feed the children by waiting?",
  "43851": "What kind of ice pudding?",
  "43852": "But what the deuce was the name?",
  "43853": "Marchiali?",
  "43854": "Shall I give you the change, my officer?",
  "43855": "What is there of good to be expected?",
  "43856": "And you know, likewise, by what sign the associates may recognize the general?",
  "43857": "What name do you give him first?",
  "43858": "You love no one?",
  "43859": "Where am I to wait for her?",
  "43860": "Absolutely drunk, eh, with my magnificence ?",

  "43891": "What can decent men do?",
  "43892": "But how do things look when we turn our attention to the relations between states?",
  "43893": "Is it sunshine to cheer and lighten the hearts of others?",
  "43894": "Why did you not come out at the door?",
  "43895": "Do you understand none of this?",
  "43896": "Why do you think so badly of me?",

  "43901": "I've got my wits, what does that mean?",
  "43902": "How can I, if her husband fails in controlling her?",
  "43903": "You are going to live here, are you not?",
  "43904": "Is it?",
  "43905": "Jane?",
  "43906": "It's a corker, ain't it?",
  "43907": "Then you have nothing more to do here?",

  "43909": "How dare they laugh at me in your house?",
  "43910": "Have I ever given him any occasion to owe me a grudge?",
  "43911": "Well, what if I am?",
  "43912": "What was it he shouted?",
  "43913": "But for a man, is it manly?",
  "43914": "Not the message?",
  "43915": "Did you get any?",
  "43916": "Not clear?",

  "43987": "What makes you talk like that?",
  "43988": "Where can I go?",
  "43989": "Where is MY home?",
  "43990": "Did you hear that?",
  "43991": "Whom shall I announce?",
  "43992": "Said I not rightly that we are a wonderful people?",
  "43993": "To whom is she to be married?",
  "43994": "And are suits decided on any other ground but that a man may neither take what is another's, nor be deprived of what is his own?",
  "43995": "How did you bear your disappointment?",
  "43996": "And you have learned nothing from any other quarter?",
  "43997": "But in what consists this preference?",
  "43998": "And the prince was pleased with you?",
  "43999": "How do we learn anything at all?",
  "44000": "But what about this interminable war?",
  "44001": "And the spider?",
  "44002": "What were they?",
  "44003": "Now what do you think of that?",
  "44004": "Can he bring a suit against him to recover his business and property?",
  "44005": "In such a matter as what?",
  "44006": "Where was she?",
  "44007": "Am I rude?",
  "44008": "Will you admit so much?",
  "44009": "Well, are you having a pleasant journey?",
  "44010": "Have you no present interest in any of the company who occupy the sofas and chairs before you?",
  "44011": "What is the lowest you will take for him?",
  "44012": "And why expose his own children in the battle?",
  "44013": "Look here, young man, are you sure you've no idea where your sister is?",
  "44014": "Are there lights in the windows?",
  "44015": "So you've been here a whole hour?",
  "44016": "How could I live an alien in that house where I had been the child?",
  "44017": "Shall you stay there?",
  "44018": "Who has not heard of the hardest drinker in all the army?",
  "44019": "Wasn't he fed, poor thing?",
  "44020": "Would it be kindness?",
  "44021": "And how shall we manage the period between birth and education, which seems to require the greatest care?",
  "44022": "How do you know she has?",
  "44023": "It was running wild after the girls may be?",
  "44024": "He sent some one?",
  "44025": "Who would know so well as you how to teach the lesson of endurance to others?",
  "44026": "Did I not think so?",
  "44027": "By making them stronger for each other's aid, will you make her less willing to discharge a lighter than a greater responsibility?",
  "44028": "But when your father comes back tomorrow what am I to tell him?",
  "44029": "Oh, do you then know him?",
  "44030": "And you think it quite right?",
  "44031": "Then, again, within the city, how will they exchange their productions?",
  "44032": "Believe what?",
  "44033": "Now, my boy, which house is it?",
  "44034": "Perhaps, concerned only for his imminent doom, he had not had sincere sorrow for his sin?",
  "44035": "How can we help?",
  "44036": "How could a man like him be expected to have any pleasure in such a discovery?",
  "44037": "So it was YOUR cry of distress that I heard?",
  "44038": "But do you suppose that if I had been I should have asked you to let me go and live with him?",
  "44039": "Are you coming?",
  "44040": "You think you're better'n your father, now, don't you, because he can't?",
  "44041": "Is it strife?",
  "44042": "What needs he the defence this arm can make?",
  "44043": "Do I understand it?",
  "44044": "What about the general?",
  "44045": "Your brother was, I believe, unmarried, was he not?",
  "44046": "Why didn't I enter the room?",
  "44047": "What will the archbishop think of that?",
  "44048": "Less pedigree?",
  "44049": "The young fellow whose arms you held, don't you know?",
  "44050": "What was then to be done?",
  "44051": "Why did not you all learn?",
  "44052": "Does it apply well to my suit?",
  "44053": "You mean my mother?",
  "44054": "What does he think I can do with his five francs?",
  "44055": "What lunacy are you talking?",
  "44056": "How could he hope ever to grow up to be as good and wise as they, or even tolerably good and wise?",
  "44057": "Lie down?",
  "44058": "Why not, my love?",
  "44059": "More smart, is it?",
  "44060": "Can it be with me?",
  "44061": "Lord?",
  "44062": "What is the matter with you that you know them?",
  "44063": "What does he mean by using a shotgun when silence was his one chance of escape?",
  "44064": "Is the time ripe now?",
  "44065": "What will be our future condition if he should beget other suns?",
  "44066": "But why are we standing here?",
  "44067": "But who knows, madam, but somebody that shall be nameless would like me best with all my little finery about me?",
  "44068": "How dare you to insinuate that you don't know my character better than your words imply?",
  "44069": "Why had he wasted his time hunting?",
  "44070": "In the hat?",
  "44071": "What is there in your mind?",
  "44072": "You really love, then, no lady at this court?",
  "44073": "Will she be safe over there?",
  "44074": "Why shouldn't we make one fireside of it, and marry each other?",
  "44075": "Have you a mind to teach the beavers to sing?",
  "44076": "Why was this?",
  "44077": "What have you got to say next?",
  "44078": "How soon can he be here?",
  "44079": "Now, what DO you want to buy?",
  "44080": "How you come to fall out?",
  "44081": "Will he come again?",
  "44082": "You're a determined little miss, aren't you?",
  "44083": "Where have you put it?",
  "44084": "Can you provide that they shall be separated at bed and board?",
  "44085": "Did anything happen this time?",
  "44086": "Where does my father get all that iron rust from?",
  "44087": "And you choose that time for grazing?",
  "44088": "Fifteen shillings a week not much, young man?",
  "44089": "If I could do that, simpleton, where would the danger be?",
  "44090": "A natural death is better than an artificial life, surely?",
  "44091": "Children dear, were we long alone?",
  "44092": "Is this number seven?",
  "44093": "Why do you suppose that I should look severely on your affection for that young man?",
  "44094": "Is this a weather to send benevolence?",
  "44095": "Who was the criminal, then?",
  "44096": "And what reason is that?",
  "44097": "Where was the difficulty?",
  "44098": "What do I care about blood?",
  "44099": "What is that stupid fellow troubling himself about?",
  "44100": "You say I can't live but a few hours?",
  "44101": "Is this a preparation for immortality?",
  "44102": "Had I ever seen so much loathing and pale horror on one countenance?",
  "44103": "When shall we start?",
  "44104": "Did I, sir?",
  "44105": "And who can tell when these happy hours may return?",
  "44106": "Don't you remember you and I had it when we were fixing the pipes outside the projectile, when we had the other breakdown?",
  "44107": "We were saying that the parents should be in the prime of life?",
  "44108": "Are these no capital?",
  "44109": "A little of the wine?",
  "44110": "Why did I at once experience a shock?",
  "44111": "Cannot I cut off the part and restore you by a sweat bath?",
  "44112": "Should art be taken seriously?",
  "44113": "But how are you to get that balance?",
  "44114": "Why this hostility of interests?",
  "44115": "What availed the noise and bustle of cheerful morning, which penetrated even there, to him?",
  "44116": "Have we not tramps and beggars enough already to pester us as we sit at meat?",
  "44117": "When shall it be?",
  "44118": "Can you turn a strain to the ladies, sir?",
  "44119": "Over whom?",
  "44120": "Didn't he ask you why you didn't bring him the papers?",
  "44121": "Would not jets of boiling water, constantly injected by the pumps, raise the temperature in this part and stay the congelation?",
  "44122": "What difference would that make?",
  "44123": "Or look you I should play the orator?",
  "44124": "Doth not wealth satiate, and become nauseous, and no longer serve to satisfy or pleasure, or to buy an hour's peace of mind?",
  "44125": "And did you do anything?",
  "44126": "You wouldn't let any enemy hurt me, if you could prevent it?",
  "44127": "You were going to say, thirdly?",
  "44128": "Do they really, you dog?",
  "44129": "Into a new light?",
  "44130": "Did she want to stay at home?",
  "44131": "Which building?",
  "44132": "But why should I consort, I, a brave man, with the abominable?",
  "44133": "Can you guess, now, what this is?",
  "44134": "Suppose you were a foundling and were shown our faith and yours, and asked for which you would decide, which would you choose?",
  "44135": "And how on earth would she ever manage to hold her tongue during school hours?",
  "44136": "Are we afraid of foreign gold?",
  "44137": "Was it a double tooth, hey?",
  "44138": "And how can it all be done by daybreak?",
  "44139": "After these, what resentment can remain in the heart?",
  "44140": "But if she has so absolutely failed, what then had she done?",
  "44141": "And you remember, too, the period when he began to grow fatter?",
  "44142": "What is nature?",
  "44143": "What was it that was borne in upon my mind when she stood still and looked attentively at me?",
  "44144": "And you're not frightened?",
  "44145": "Are you a politician, friend?",
  "44146": "Have you not got all the plants and stones you want?",
  "44147": "What time was it?",
  "44148": "Is it obeying your husband to disobey him on the wital subject of his business?",
  "44149": "On what grounds?",
  "44150": "What is your address in the country?",
  "44151": "How will he ever know the truth, since I shall not tell him of it?",
  "44152": "It was he who rescued you?",
  "44153": "What de devil you here for, den?",
  "44154": "What, for instance, do you mean by all that humbug about the soul?",
  "44155": "Cannot I answer your purpose?",
  "44156": "Natasha, it's magical, isn't it?",
  "44157": "To whom did he give up his sword?",
  "44158": "Would not that be a sacrifice of higher prospects for you?",
  "44159": "An't you?",
  "44160": "Say, what can cause such impotence of mind?",
  "44161": "But the doctor?",
  "44162": "What business have I with this pipe?",
  "44163": "You have a recipe for it?",
  "44164": "Hang the boy, can't I never learn anything?",
  "44165": "But she?",
  "44166": "Do you know anything about fortifications?",
  "44167": "Is there no merit in repentance?",
  "44168": "What became of you, dear?",
  "44169": "Well, what is to be done, mademoiselle, when so many wills are leagued against me?",
  "44170": "And besides, what is truth to us but the continuous progress of our mind from poetry to prose?",
  "44171": "Is there any point to which you would wish to draw my attention?",
  "44172": "Shall we go in?",
  "44173": "And how would I do it, think you?",
  "44174": "At least we can have a window?",
  "44175": "It was somewhere here?",
  "44176": "Must one die like a dog?",
  "44177": "What does that wagon contain?",
  "44178": "What's the matter with your leg?",
  "44179": "Might not some curious eye fasten on it, and divine its contents?",
  "44180": "What is the difference?",
  "44181": "Who's the other fool?",
  "44182": "Well, do you understand, monsieur?",
  "44183": "You are doing catkins?",
  "44184": "Now, how does a man search a revolving bookcase?",
  "44185": "On what ground do you venture to interfere with me, messieurs?",
  "44186": "What ails ye, man?",
  "44187": "What would be your surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness?",
  "44188": "If you're not coming yourself, give us the cards, will you?",
  "44189": "In the office?",
  "44190": "Ah, precious one, why does your lover live to see you dead?",
  "44191": "Could she be deceived as to the meaning of this?",
  "44192": "Do you really mean to say that that leg of yours is better already?",
  "44193": "Do you not think perhaps that some of the shortcoming lies with yourself?",
  "44194": "Her name?",
  "44195": "How can that be, monsieur?",
  "44196": "What duties?",
  "44197": "And suppose he can obtain his desires, is that so bad as cutting her throat?",
  "44198": "Look here, do you intend to take up you abode with us?",
  "44199": "What do you want to drink now?",
  "44200": "Carey?",
  "44201": "Happy?",
  "44202": "How old are you?",
  "44203": "Is it such as they that we are to follow?",
  "44204": "Do you not think that I also long for forgetfulness?",
  "44205": "What's this?",
  "44206": "What is the captain about?",
  "44207": "Cannot you tell him I will?",
  "44208": "Now, couldn't you swear she was going to get up in a minute?",
  "44209": "Why had he not let them know that he was still working on the case?",
  "44210": "A ghost?",
  "44211": "Will you work?",
  "44212": "Where have you been, this long, long while?",
  "44213": "What might not have happened to men?",
  "44214": "With what color of propriety could the force necessary for defense be limited by those who cannot limit the force of offense?",
  "44215": "Is it bright?",
  "44216": "How could I know he hated him?",
  "44217": "But didn't she say all about it?",
  "44218": "And all this, for what, I pray?",
  "44219": "Who told you that I loved him?",
  "44220": "Is that what you meant?",
  "44221": "And did I do it for my country's sake?",
  "44222": "Why did you get married?",
  "44223": "But what exactly am I to tell you about them?",
  "44224": "Now where will it be agreeable to you that we hold our conference?",
  "44225": "Why does fate play such tricks with poor, helpless worms?",
  "44226": "Have you ever seen a snake rise up on your path?",
  "44227": "Do passive indolent women make the best wives?",
  "44228": "What would you feel, if a man were faithless to you?",
  "44229": "Has a dog money?",
  "44230": "What do you want there?",
  "44231": "Eliza, girl, what ails you today?",
  "44232": "What is there for me to eat this evening?",
  "44233": "Is there fate amongst us still, send down from the pagan world of old, that such things must be, and in such way?",
  "44234": "Then you had some grounds for supposing he might be the culprit?",
  "44235": "How on earth did you manage to become the favorite of the king, you who have never spoken to him more than twice in your life?",
  "44236": "And your second wish?",
  "44237": "If the view from below had been most interesting and singular, how shall I describe its appearance as seen from above?",
  "44238": "What do you think of a brilliant display of fireworks?",
  "44239": "Are you cold?",
  "44240": "Not so dusty, what?",
  "44241": "Till death itself?",
  "44242": "To defend him would be to accuse herself, would it not?",
  "44243": "But do you think it will rise?",
  "44244": "As bad as all that?",
  "44245": "May it not be spoken except in private?",
  "44246": "For the story?",
  "44247": "But not as a CELEBRITY?",
  "44248": "When did you first begin this mad career?",
  "44249": "May he share your hopes?",
  "44250": "Would she so?",
  "44251": "Do you place it out at interest?",
  "44252": "I suppose that's why you never got married, uncle?",
  "44253": "But do you know why he did not come, papa?",
  "44254": "Then he is on board?",
  "44255": "Do you find the study of the lower orders interesting?",
  "44256": "Can you make any objection?",
  "44257": "It is quite decided, then?",
  "44258": "What shall I pay you for the body?",
  "44259": "Would he not rather say or do the same as his like in the same case?",
  "44260": "Stryver?",
  "44261": "But how do you and your neighbour get on about the disputed right of way?",
  "44262": "It is possible we may meet again,' and 'will it be of any consequence to you whether we do or not?",
  "44263": "Would he have to abdicate his precentorship, as he had his wardenship, and to give up chanting, as he had given up his twelve old bedesmen?",
  "44264": "What is he waiting for?",
  "44265": "Do you remember that's what you used to call them?",
  "44266": "And where is coldness so ugly as between brothers?",
  "44267": "You know you let me call you so?",
  "44268": "Where is he, then?",
  "44269": "Does the cardinal refuse to receive the king?",
  "44270": "Theurgy, magic, and sorcery?",
  "44271": "What can have happened to them all this time?",
  "44272": "What did you talk about?",
  "44273": "Why on earth do you say that?",
  "44274": "Do you know why it's called a whiting?",
  "44275": "Eyebrows?",
  "44276": "Could I forget them?",
  "44277": "Number and date taken, I suppose?",
  "44278": "Have I not borne secrets heavier than this?",
  "44279": "But, then, accidents?",
  "44280": "Do you think it would be any harm?",
  "44281": "Conrad, what is it?",
  "44282": "Is there nobody here who can sing a song to lighten the time?",
  "44283": "Bless me, how shall I behave?",
  "44284": "What harm can I do to you or to her?",
  "44285": "On me, uncle?",
  "44286": "Somebody has stolen a rabbit?",
  "44287": "Why enter into painful details, so easily divined by the intelligent reader?",
  "44288": "How do you come here?",
  "44289": "Does any answer come out of it?",
  "44290": "How can he find out his strength or weakness otherwise?",

  "44299": "Why did they fancy you?",
  "44300": "Will that suit you?",
  "44301": "Feel what, squire?",
  "44302": "So, then, am I her enemy?",
  "44303": "Saturday?",
  "44304": "How do you keep it on?",
  "44305": "Then why don't they give it up?",
  "44306": "Well, what if there is a trial?",
  "44307": "What are you yourself seeking?",
  "44308": "Would I be quiet and talk rationally?",
  "44309": "Well, what can you do?",
  "44310": "But what would grammar matter if he really loved her?",
  "44311": "Has he marked himself?",
  "44312": "I ask by whose authority?",
  "44313": "Master bridegroom, where are you?",
  "44314": "Why need he bother about my tuft?",
  "44315": "Farfrae's?",
  "44316": "Are you turning up your noses?",
  "44317": "What then remained?",
  "44318": "You're getting too proud to own me afore company, are you?",
  "44319": "Your father was fortunate, then?",
  "44320": "Do you really believe that such is our aim?",
  "44321": "Could he, as he asked, stop the sea with his hands?",

  "44323": "What has she done?",
  "44324": "I've fretted my gizzard green about it, maister, but what can I do?",
  "44325": "Could it be possible that even now a remnant of that lost race inhabited the ruined grandeur that had once been their progenitor?",
  "44326": "Quite for ever?",
  "44327": "Why do you keep tramping up and down like an old hen?",
  "44328": "Is it ketching?",
  "44329": "Your opinion, if you please, on this difficult matter?",
  "44330": "As her husband was a man of means, and had doubtless returned by this time, could she not send them the money?",
  "44331": "And dark?",
  "44332": "What name would your friend like to put on it?",
  "44333": "What are you going to tell me?",
  "44334": "Aren't they laughing at me?",
  "44335": "And if you wished to die, you would choose this death, count?",
  "44336": "You hain't seen no towhead?",
  "44337": "Do you think I don't repent?",
  "44338": "What are you doing out of your studio at this hour?",
  "44339": "Is love the only thing?",
  "44340": "Oh, you didn't?",
  "44341": "For that only?",
  "44342": "And I hope you're good children, are you?",
  "44343": "How was it that no one else saw it?",
  "44344": "In our own house?",
  "44345": "Cannot you inform him that it is frightful earnest?",
  "44346": "Well, what shall we do?",
  "44347": "Why shouldn't it be?",
  "44348": "Well, then, are you the brave captain, are you the valiant blade who dispersed those who wished to burn the condemned?",
  "44349": "Will you please look into the case and restore the old man to his home if the public interest will admit?",
  "44350": "Why should we not imagine this the apartment of an honest mother?",

  "44370": "Come, who is this man who is in the basket?",
  "44371": "You don't happen to know of any other that would be at liberty?",
  "44372": "Because I like his company?",
  "44373": "How many desperate wretches have I sent to the devil?",
  "44374": "You've got them at last?",

  "44700": "Is not all the world against me?",
  "44701": "The gift of a friend?",
  "44702": "What would the subjects of the extracts I should have had to make from books, or even the books themselves, have signified to me?",
  "44703": "Can any reasons be given for the prevalence of any one or all of the methods?",
  "44704": "But do you think as they've done her in, sir?",
  "44705": "Why should he strive?",
  "44706": "If the lady is hurt as bad as you say, who was it that wrote this note?",
  "44707": "Does your mother wash?",
  "44708": "What would you have done if you had had to go into the army, to go and fight beneath the standard?",

  "45153": "For not alluding to your leaving us?",
  "45154": "What then must be the result?",
  "45155": "What is all settled?",
  "45156": "Saw you those meteors?",
  "45157": "And what will that good treatment be?",
  "45158": "Well, but is there any war on record which was carried on successfully by him, or aided by his counsels, when he was alive?",

  "45167": "Then the cost of this vessel is great?",
  "45168": "Socrates, has taken possession of you all?",
  "45169": "Have you seen for YOUR self?",
  "45170": "Bore me, my dear?",
  "45171": "How can I ever pay you?",

  "45741": "How is this strange silence to be accounted for?",
  "45742": "But, putting that aside altogether, what would they live on?",
  "45743": "But how and where?",
  "45744": "Come, will you take me as I am?",

  "45775": "Have you ever had any experience upon the stage?",
  "45776": "On the jury, are you?",
  "45777": "Your excellency knows him?",
  "45778": "We know that the first has been here, but where are the signs of the other?",
  "45779": "How many chloral tabloids did you take?",
  "45780": "And what injury would they do to others?",
  "45781": "Why does it stop there?",
  "45782": "Are you getting about again yet, old fellow?",
  "45783": "Have you any means of transport?",
  "45784": "Why should you put things so bitterly, dearie?",
  "45785": "The millionaire's mite, eh?",

  "45787": "Are they real?",
  "45788": "And for what purpose?",
  "45789": "Do you suppose the boat will sail promptly?",
  "45790": "What was its standard?",
  "45791": "Do you remember how silent I was on the drive back?",
  "45792": "Besides, why were they not allowed to escape?",
  "45793": "Were we really there half an hour?",
  "45794": "Does that satisfy you?",
  "45795": "Won't you have something warm to drink?",
  "45796": "Do you see that, my dear?",
  "45797": "The circumstances?",
  "45798": "Would you imagine it?",
  "45799": "O, is't the custom?",
  "45800": "How many had I?",
  "45801": "What does he want me to do, I wonder?",
  "45802": "What, outside our line?",
  "45803": "Is this the way I must return to native dust?",
  "45804": "You think he has run away, do you, sir?",
  "45805": "That he should appear only at that point?",
  "45806": "What are you saying?",
  "45807": "Foolish indeed?",
  "45808": "Quite strong and well, I hope?",
  "45809": "Is his power of speech gone?",
  "45810": "Would he not have done better to have kept the water that he had decomposed in pure loss, in order to sustain him in the air?",
  "45811": "And he might have asked also, where the industry so necessary for such a trade?",
  "45812": "But if I justify it?",
  "45813": "Was he so awfully hot?",
  "45814": "Isn't that your tobacco lying there?",
  "45815": "What is thy name, fellow?",
  "45816": "Where she would be settled?",
  "45817": "Has madame come in yet?",
  "45818": "And which I can have?",

  "45822": "Where can we be going in such a tiny pool of water?",
  "45823": "Had you heard that?",
  "45824": "But what then, made her so unhappy?",
  "45825": "No brother at all?",
  "45826": "The question I have to ask myself is, shall I marry him?",
  "45827": "Have you been dragging the river all day, gentlemen?",
  "45828": "Perhaps two o'clock will suit you better?",
  "45829": "Anyone in the room could get out?",
  "45830": "A dream?",
  "45831": "And his eminence, the cardinal?",
  "45832": "Did you answer it yourself?",

  "45844": "You're wretched, he's wretched, and what good can come of it?",
  "45845": "You have received a regular letter of advice?",
  "45846": "What was that awful noise?",
  "45847": "I asked him where he meant to go?",
  "45848": "And light of foot?",
  "45849": "Do you feel unwell?",
  "45850": "What is a fontis?",
  "45851": "And will not their wives be the best women?",
  "45852": "How, then, did you deduce the telegram?",

  "45854": "Why should not my father see him?",
  "45855": "I have heard a party was to leave the encampment this morning for the lake shore?",
  "45856": "What do you call important?",
  "45857": "And, really, what is the result of all this?",
  "45858": "Beg him to come at once, do you hear?",
  "45859": "What do you do in your cottage when it rains like this?",
  "45860": "If so, what we are afraid of, when we but suspect our enemies will inflict it on us, shall we inflict it on ourselves for certain?",
  "45861": "But where are you going really?",
  "45862": "Did not the sun shine upon him with a halo, so that he was bright as an angel?",
  "45863": "No dinner?",
  "45864": "How much does the proprietor increase the utility of his tenant's products?",
  "45865": "You've never worked at anything like this before, have you?",
  "45866": "Did you see us?",
  "45867": "But who could ever repay half the debt we owe you?",
  "45868": "Could he have thrown down the statue after he'd stripped the corpse?",
  "45869": "Shall we say in one hour's time?",
  "45870": "First of all, what did you see?",
  "45871": "Why, where ever did you go?",
  "45872": "You mean the rascals?",
  "45873": "Is it really calling us?",
  "45874": "Do they not think, they will have their own ends, and be truer to themselves, than to them?",
  "45875": "What humour's this?",
  "45876": "How about when you lose?",
  "45877": "But how about the new orbit in which we are moving?",
  "45878": "Shall I lead the way?",
  "45879": "Where was the poor devil to go?",

  "45885": "Well, did he?",
  "45886": "What the deuce have you done with yourself this last month?",
  "45887": "Why should we load ourselves with a useless burden?",
  "45888": "Had he, beneath the childish face, already recognized the passionate, proud woman?",
  "45889": "What is the reward?",
  "45890": "Why, why, why, are there no harbours of refuge for grown men who have not yet lost them?",

  "45896": "What was his purpose?",
  "45897": "There were brave men among them, but of what use was courage when their weapons were powerless against the monster?",
  "45898": "Have you any witness on't?",
  "45899": "Is it a bargain?",
  "45900": "And in the common way of his business does he not expect to be paid for his pictures?",
  "45901": "Who is this youth?",
  "45902": "Not named?",
  "45903": "He hain't been a sittin' so all day, has he?",
  "45904": "And where is your young master?",
  "45905": "How can we truly open the doors, and set free the full genius of our people?",

  "45907": "We will go up now, shall we?",
  "45908": "But, it will be asked again, can we on these grounds, admit the existence of a wise and omnipotent author of the world?",
  "45909": "You have taken them away?",
  "45910": "Save it?",
  "45911": "To do with you, my lord?",
  "45912": "What boots it to deplore?",
  "45913": "How do you manage yours?",

  "46379": "Am I not a man and a brother?",
  "46380": "Are you afraid?",
  "46381": "Champion?",
  "46382": "Don't I love him more than before?",
  "46383": "Match?",
  "46384": "How did you happen to be here?",
  "46385": "Is not such the doom of all speculative men of talent?",
  "46386": "But what does it mean?",
  "46387": "Why, what has he in him of such virtue to be regarded, ha?",
  "46388": "Get on, will you?",
  "46389": "Yea, forsooth?",
  "46390": "And, considering the question of human happiness, where, oh where does it reside?",
  "46391": "Aramis?",
  "46392": "Didn't it strike 'ee that 'twas so?",
  "46393": "But why do you not rise and greet your guest?",
  "46394": "Why did you not give up that lewd habit, that impure habit?",
  "46395": "So that's it, is it?",

  "46399": "But are you seriously wounded?",
  "46400": "Why didn't you say I was dead?",
  "46401": "But can it last?",
  "46402": "Why should she fight against every admission until it was forced from her?",
  "46403": "But, gentlemen, an't I to come in for a share of the profits?",
  "46404": "Well, who knows?",
  "46405": "You will write to me, won't you?",
  "46406": "Are ye lighting a fire, or are ye taking to cooking?",

  "46459": "D'you call life a bad job?",
  "46460": "You will not be my comforter, my rescuer?",
  "46461": "And who were the others?",
  "46462": "You didn't definitely ask her for it, I suppose?",
  "46463": "Why shouldn't it?",
  "46464": "Can it be that they won't forgive me, won't understand how it all couldn't be helped?",
  "46465": "Do you understand?",
  "46466": "How much does he spend yearly?",
  "46467": "O, was it no otherwise?",

  "46475": "But how came you upon the roof, man?",
  "46476": "La sakes, now, does it?",
  "46477": "Or did he think a chief possessing such blood in his veins could engage in such a foreign pursuit?",
  "46478": "Hear you?",
  "46479": "Will they never cease to expect corn from tares, and figs from thistles?",
  "46480": "Why SHOULD you hold out forever?",
  "46481": "Then what was it?",
  "46482": "Else, why should it be let so cheaply?",
  "46483": "Is it possible that there can be many such people on earth?",
  "46484": "And might a man be thirsty, and yet unwilling to drink?",
  "46485": "What is the secret, then?",
  "46486": "But was it on her own account, or on account of another, that she exposed herself to such hazards?",
  "46487": "Shall I tell YOU?",
  "46488": "Isn't that a pathetic strain?",
  "46489": "Ain't that a funny name?",
  "46490": "Whuzzamatter wiz you, hey?",
  "46491": "And you have heard his fortune mentioned?",
  "46492": "Is there in the world, anything outside of the tribunals, executory sentences, the police and the authorities?",
  "46493": "Yeobright?",
  "46494": "But you don't surely mean to walk all the way back?",
  "46495": "Do you accept the wager?",
  "46496": "Now, who the deuce do I know?",
  "46497": "Very well, sir, what next?",
  "46498": "Can it be possible to see anything equal to what we have seen?",
  "46499": "Ha, what is he, man?",
  "46500": "You are pretty strong, eh?",
  "46501": "Why such a large land army?",
  "46502": "What is it my father does not know?",
  "46503": "Don't you think we pay too much rent here?",
  "46504": "Is their spiritual condition, I often wonder, much higher than their physical one?",
  "46505": "Heard what?",
  "46506": "Shall I describe his life to you?",
  "46507": "Would they stop short at the hairy cuticle, or would they attack the brain?",

  "46514": "Where were you thinking of going?",
  "46515": "Do you hear the guns, pray?",
  "46516": "Should we not rather say JURISIGNORANCE?",
  "46517": "But what about a thing like this?",
  "46518": "Was not that better than taking him prisoner?",
  "46519": "What was the name that he mentioned?",
  "46520": "Are you ready to be tested?",
  "46521": "How could I have exposed myself in their presence?",
  "46522": "Shall I see if we can manage that?",
  "46523": "Marguerite, CHERIE, what is it?",
  "46524": "Done?",
  "46525": "My dear archdeacon, who ever expected to see you?",
  "46526": "Why, have you not got any water?",
  "46527": "I think she must have guessed, in a way, don't you, what I was going to say?",
  "46528": "How could he hope to escape them?",
  "46529": "What is man's responsibility to society, the conception of which results from the conception of freedom?",
  "46530": "Now, how little do I look like being carried away trembling?",
  "46531": "To men who had risked their lives for him, and besides had done him a great service?",
  "46532": "What's the matter now?",
  "46533": "Is it to be so?",
  "46534": "This morning was it?",
  "46535": "And you don't think it's an answer, eh?",
  "46536": "What other thing do you think I could dream of doing?",
  "46537": "Which house is it?",
  "46538": "By whom?",
  "46539": "But has the problem been well put?",
  "46540": "Could any thing in womanhood be so vile?",
  "46541": "There were two parts in our former scheme of education, were there not?",
  "46542": "Shall I tell you what I always think of you and the fortune yet to come for you, my love?",
  "46543": "Who is the fellow?",
  "46544": "Pleased to be thus undeceived, I laughed at his consternation, and asked what brought him thither?",
  "46545": "Was he losing his reason and thinking he heard things which were not for human ears?",
  "46546": "How far may the idler take advantage of the laborer?",
  "46547": "Why are you going?",
  "46548": "Perhaps you could stop stuffing your nostrils with that dirty snuff?",
  "46549": "What became of the whales in that time?",
  "46550": "Who could attempt to pursue him?",
  "46551": "Genius banished?",
  "46552": "How dare I?",
  "46553": "Well, prince, whom are we to suspect, then?",
  "46554": "I think you had some good reason for giving up the habit of going there?",
  "46555": "What day of the month is it?",
  "46556": "Is he mad, then, that mysterious old fellow?",
  "46557": "But what sort of a sailor are you?",
  "46558": "Of course you, in your position, must think a girl a castaway who isn't going to be married?",
  "46559": "Who can resist them?",
  "46560": "You think the count will be angry with me?",
  "46561": "But where?",
  "46562": "Did you ever hear the like?",
  "46563": "Who is this man?",
  "46564": "It don't take a man long to hang himself, either, eh?",
  "46565": "Who wishes you would?",
  "46566": "Is he here now?",
  "46567": "What was it you said to me?",
  "46568": "You in bed?",
  "46569": "Am I wanted?",
  "46570": "How came you to be here?",
  "46571": "Can they have gone out?",
  "46572": "Is it of being poor, forsaken, wretched, that you accuse me?",
  "46573": "Did it change her much?",
  "46574": "What was jour offence?",
  "46575": "Aren't you cold?",
  "46576": "Who forbade you?",
  "46577": "What is your name, my gentle angel?",
  "46578": "But you don't tell me why you do such a thing as this?",
  "46579": "So this is our minstrel?",
  "46580": "Yes, why should I stay here?",
  "46581": "Were you then permitted the use of pens, ink, and paper?",
  "46582": "What do you do?",
  "46583": "A dog, for instance?",
  "46584": "Can the cannon support the shock of the pyroxyle?",

  "46588": "What decision did he come to?",
  "46589": "How can I bear it?",
  "46590": "What am I to say to the creature?",
  "46591": "How would you like to be treated so?",
  "46592": "Is there any one closer to me nor you, or is it likely I'd be listening to stories brought against you?",
  "46593": "And can you not see, sir, the truth that's in me?",
  "46594": "Well, young fellow, are you glad to come to school?",
  "46595": "As how, good signior?",
  "46596": "Has not that been admitted?",
  "46597": "At a registrar's?",
  "46598": "Have you read this bulletin?",
  "46599": "He of whom I have such just apprehensions?",
  "46600": "Did a woman arrive at this place night before last?",
  "46601": "Does anything occur to yourself?",
  "46602": "Then what are they?",
  "46603": "Your father, eh?",
  "46604": "Isn't that what you did?",
  "46605": "Have they not obeyed me?",
  "46606": "Isn't that a stratagem?",
  "46607": "What have you got, broth, is it?",
  "46608": "Where are my amusements?",
  "46609": "What has a father to do with it?",
  "46610": "Do I take you with me?",
  "46611": "Do you understand the theory of that affair?",
  "46612": "But you swear you won't say a word?",
  "46613": "Do you hear the way she'll be rating at your own self when a week is by?",
  "46614": "But, still, what sort of danger?",
  "46615": "No more than this?",
  "46616": "Where were the keys?",
  "46617": "Nobody know what this fudge can be?",
  "46618": "Come, what is it?",
  "46619": "Is loyalty too weak?",
  "46620": "What result, then, has ensued?",
  "46621": "Would not it be said by my presumptive remorse that, by my gallantry, manner and dress, I was going to seduce her?",
  "46622": "Never before?",
  "46623": "What do you mean, please, by my having 'done' with you?",
  "46624": "To who, sir?",
  "46625": "Did they try it on you?",
  "46626": "Are you thirsty?",
  "46627": "Will monseigneur give me the order?",
  "46628": "Where is the gardener's son now?",
  "46629": "Would it not be well that he should put an end to himself, and thus escape?",
  "46630": "Isn't it jolly to hear her?",
  "46631": "Is it not generous of him?",
  "46632": "What is the matter with you?",
  "46633": "You hear them when the window is open?",
  "46634": "You can?",
  "46635": "Now, what is the good of driblets?",
  "46636": "I'm not come too soon, am I?",
  "46637": "In fact, this bullet must have issued from a firearm, and who but a human being could have used such a weapon?",
  "46638": "Then you sat there like that, just you and she, all by yourselves?",
  "46639": "Why have I not seen you?",
  "46640": "Do you guess the reason?",
  "46641": "Is the one right any better than the other?",
  "46642": "Am I cut off from the last fond pride of meanest shipwrecked captains?",
  "46643": "Can'st not read it?",
  "46644": "Isn't it so?",
  "46645": "What is it, uncle?",
  "46646": "Is it my doing?",
  "46647": "To which dialect was he indebted?",
  "46648": "Can you play on the piano?",
  "46649": "You have no money coming in on which you can rely?",
  "46650": "From such a kind family?",
  "46651": "Why did you leave us?",
  "46652": "Who was there among all whom she knew to whom she could appeal for sympathy?",
  "46653": "Well, and you?",
  "46654": "Do I not know that, all the country round, men and woman are calling me the same behind my back?",
  "46655": "Who are these people on the side of the bill?",
  "46656": "But what is it, then?",
  "46657": "But who, then was this man?",
  "46658": "Then they do not know it yet?",
  "46659": "You won't hold that noise, won't you?",
  "46660": "Be so kind as to walk home with him, will you?",
  "46661": "Richard?",
  "46662": "What is a prison?",
  "46663": "Are you sure?",
  "46664": "Oh, will you be quiet, and help me to carry her?",
  "46665": "Have you not read your bulletin?",
  "46666": "Shall domestic manufactures be encouraged, and in what degree, by restrictions on foreign manufactures?",
  "46667": "Or shall we say they may be continued as long as the danger which occasioned their being raised continues?",
  "46668": "Can you tell me any ill he has done?",
  "46669": "What is government?",
  "46670": "How could I forget?",
  "46671": "Hoo wor it?",
  "46672": "But why should they suppose that I despise generals?",
  "46673": "So both the brothers escaped the common fate?",
  "46674": "Where are we to live?",
  "46675": "Well, they didn't run t' day, did they, hey?",
  "46676": "What reason do they give?",
  "46677": "Do you suppose I want to shoot myself?",
  "46678": "Is it not good?",
  "46679": "Was that a trick to make me say which one I prefer?",
  "46680": "And get enchanted again?",
  "46681": "Why not, if what you assert is untrue?",
  "46682": "What's the odds where it comes from?",
  "46683": "Could she go back to the former quiet pleasures of those faraway days before the concert?",
  "46684": "Well, will you go if I change my clothes?",
  "46685": "Oh, he mentioned his name, did he?",
  "46686": "Can you let me sit by the fire?",
  "46687": "Then how?",
  "46688": "How is it possible to hear her?",
  "46689": "How are we going to get back?",
  "46690": "Need you say it face to face?",
  "46691": "Wooster?",
  "46692": "Will he get used to it?",
  "46693": "Look, will this insolence amend thy lot?",
  "46694": "Who may the four be?",
  "46695": "Do I look as if I liked it?",
  "46696": "Well, is it good?",
  "46697": "Then a man may feel for years that he is good solid company, and be wrong about himself after all?",
  "46698": "Did I say you wasn't beautiful?",
  "46699": "Are we only half way up?",
  "46700": "Pray, when, sir, shall I see you at my house?",
  "46701": "But when is this ball to take place?",
  "46702": "Doesn't it look nice, and grand, and patriarchal?",
  "46703": "And my son?",
  "46704": "But will you gi'e me all the ground the goose flew over?",
  "46705": "Who denies you this right?",
  "46706": "What is the rule in such a case?",
  "46707": "You don't find this life very interesting, I dare say?",
  "46708": "How do you mean to live then?",
  "46709": "If you see us among scores of women, will you look upon us?",
  "46710": "Where does the remainder go?",
  "46711": "Wasn't it here a minute ago?",
  "46712": "Did any of you see him trailing us?",
  "46713": "And was he sure of what he said?",
  "46714": "I wrote to you for some grammars, if you recollect, and you sent them?",
  "46715": "But shall we go down and watch this absorbing match?",
  "46716": "My plans?",
  "46717": "And who had deserved the worst?",
  "46718": "Do you believe in my instinctive feelings?",
  "46719": "Are you sure I can get all the things I want there?",
  "46720": "On the front?",
  "46721": "Why weary, and palsy the arm at the oar, and the iron, and the lance?",
  "46722": "Her father, eh?",
  "46723": "What difference did it make?",
  "46724": "Are my purposes wont to be so shallow?",
  "46725": "Have you had any tea, by the by?",
  "46726": "What promise?",
  "46727": "Who finds them?",
  "46728": "Digby, whence this fire?",
  "46729": "What are you doing there, my friend?",
  "46730": "Did you treat anybody, sir?",
  "46731": "May I?",
  "46732": "Why can't you help it now?",
  "46733": "And why was I running after her?",
  "46734": "Shall history be blind to such fatality as this?",
  "46735": "Must I ever be on the way?",
  "46736": "But could you BEAR to have it swinging to your boat?",
  "46737": "Won't you hurry yourself?",
  "46738": "Why, what's the reason, sir?",
  "46739": "What might I not get to know, nearly concerning you?",

  "46741": "What do they want?",
  "46742": "Don't what?",
  "46743": "What is it like?",
  "46744": "And do you care?",
  "46745": "Count on my assistance?",
  "46746": "Where are they to be found?",
  "46747": "Must I always be the same?",
  "46748": "Why, pray, did you laugh at this?",
  "46749": "You can't run a church that way, can you?",
  "46750": "And were you warm?",
  "46751": "Whence comes that money?",
  "46752": "Where are we?",
  "46753": "If I told her all my fortune is lost?",
  "46754": "Who is a foolish man?",
  "46755": "What matter?",
  "46756": "Have you anything to say to me?",
  "46757": "Who are you?",

  "46765": "Are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and reconciliation?",
  "46766": "Fwhat's she doin' outside?",
  "46767": "And what do you know about the state you talk of?",
  "46768": "And why should I hesitate to betray that monster, sir?",
  "46769": "Nay, what is there that is not open to your very enemies?",
  "46770": "What is she to us?",
  "46771": "What are you?",
  "46772": "Am I to pay the piper?",
  "46773": "Who's up stairs, you dog?",
  "46774": "Who is this beauty and where is she to be seen, when she was not seen before till you saw her, if you did see her?",
  "46775": "Is it to do us some ill turn?",

  "46777": "You wretch, eat up your visitors in your own house?",
  "46778": "Well, but that was only when I was a bit on, don't you know?",
  "46779": "Who's she?",
  "46780": "Where and when have you seen me trifle with a friend's heart and a king's life?",
  "46781": "Even when no one can hear us, may I, by no syllable, by none, not the slightest intimation, remind you of our love?",
  "46782": "Yes, it is a child, but who brought it here?",
  "46783": "Has he solved the antinomy of the division of labor, perpetual cause of the workingman's ignorance, immorality, and poverty?",
  "46784": "Eh?",
  "46785": "Have you made anything out of the tangle?",
  "46786": "And you wouldn't leave them any?",
  "46787": "What are you making such a fuss about?",
  "46788": "Well, then, whom does it concern?",
  "46789": "Do you not deduce something from that?",
  "46790": "But who could have taken it?",
  "46791": "One figure whose movements you follow with at least curiosity?",
  "46792": "One?",
  "46793": "What's to become of him?",
  "46794": "May I read it over again?",
  "46795": "How shall I ever mourn enough for all my kinsmen?",
  "46796": "Shall a man not come back to the loveliest lady in all the wide world?",
  "46797": "How long will you be with us?",
  "46798": "Does she know it?",
  "46799": "You heard of the duel?",
  "46800": "Can you show me the place as I go back?",
  "46801": "What else could I do?",
  "46802": "And do you think we have nothing to fear if we land?",
  "46803": "And are you going to make a fisherman of him?",
  "46804": "What kind of spectacle would its hidden hemisphere present to our terrestrial spheroid?",
  "46805": "Would you have doomed me, at any time, to the frost and blight that have hardened and spoiled me?",
  "46806": "Couldn't this have been an accident?",
  "46807": "They don't look bad, do they?",
  "46808": "A secret ambassador?",
  "46809": "Do you not constantly argue that this is not the right place to oppose it?",
  "46810": "Then you have some secret hope to buoy you up and please you with whispers of the future?",
  "46811": "But where are you hurrying now?",
  "46812": "Do you mean to pretend that you didn't know it would be injurious to her to meet you here week after week?",
  "46813": "Isn't that music gay?",
  "46814": "You have the same eye to your own interest, that you always had, I doubt not?",
  "46815": "And how should you understand him?",
  "46816": "A coward?",
  "46817": "What have you done about it?",
  "46818": "What could he get by that?",
  "46819": "Do you know whom she reminds me of?",
  "46820": "The accusation?",
  "46821": "Now I ask, what idea do we form of these bodies or objects, to which we suppose solidity to belong?",
  "46822": "But am I in time?",
  "46823": "Will he not utterly hate a lie?",
  "46824": "I had the best of it this time?",
  "46825": "Can you understand the happiness I get out of my absinthe?",
  "46826": "How know you that?",
  "46827": "Now?",
  "46828": "And what kind of fool?",
  "46829": "Casaubon?",
  "46830": "Is it KETCHING?",
  "46831": "Can you wash dishes right?",
  "46832": "But do they not rather demonstrate the absence of a gang?",
  "46833": "Do you think I'm a presumptuous fool?",
  "46834": "Why need I insist further?",
  "46835": "Is he a poet?",
  "46836": "Am I alive and a reality, or am I but a dream?",
  "46837": "Indeed, sir?",
  "46838": "Then the moon was once inhabited?",
  "46839": "Nothing the matter?",
  "46840": "Are we still under the sea?",
  "46841": "Why didn't you tell me before I came home?",
  "46842": "But tell me, how does he produce the appearance of death?",
  "46843": "Know you what such a moment holds for me?",
  "46844": "Don't you think it must be very uncomfortable to be married to a man whose first wife was perfect?",
  "46845": "Now, my ladies, you strike him not?",
  "46846": "What is the matter, D'Artagnan?",
  "46847": "Is that the idea?",
  "46848": "Will that be necessary?",
  "46849": "You're proud of them?",
  "46850": "Why should an exception be made in her favor?",
  "46851": "Gone where?",
  "46852": "What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman?",
  "46853": "Did ever any one see such a fine piece of beef so completely ruined?",
  "46854": "Yea, is it so bad as that?",
  "46855": "Who does me this?",
  "46856": "And people think it so?",
  "46857": "What have I done that you should pass on me so severe a sentence?",
  "46858": "Did the gentleman give a name?",
  "46859": "Were they then so soon to lose him whom they had snatched from an agonizing death?",
  "46860": "And what shall you do?",
  "46861": "But why so?",
  "46862": "He was disposed to interfere too much, was he?",
  "46863": "Hot and moist?",
  "46864": "Any guerrillas?",
  "46865": "Is he goodly enough?",
  "46866": "And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?",
  "46867": "He is a rebel, then?",
  "46868": "Did you ever meet with anything like that man out of this blessed country?",
  "46869": "What were we who had strayed in here?",
  "46870": "Have I not sworn to you that I loved you in return?",
  "46871": "How have you passed the time?",
  "46872": "Why shouldn't she come down?",
  "46873": "Had it struck on a submerged rock, or on an enormous wreck?",
  "46874": "But what if it all had been lost?",
  "46875": "Why had that man taken to flight on the arrival of the police, instead of entering a complaint?",
  "46876": "If it isn't, what are we here for?",
  "46877": "But the light?",
  "46878": "And what happens?",
  "46879": "Kindly?",
  "46880": "But what step would you propose to me?",
  "46881": "Why should you want to spite her?",
  "46882": "Don't you see, my boy, that these things are debits?",
  "46883": "Can men refuse to be pleased with words of gentle advice?",
  "46884": "And just actions cause justice, and unjust actions cause injustice?",
  "46885": "Shall he live?",
  "46886": "What d'ye mean by that?",
  "46887": "Do you think he can last till morning?",
  "46888": "Don't you want to destroy it at ONCE?",
  "46889": "What, if I am steeped in poverty?",
  "46890": "An advice?",
  "46891": "No one?",
  "46892": "Oh, but can't you have the kindness to take me in?",
  "46893": "Is it in this mode that the spirit of mutual support and common effort for the common good, is to be cultivated?",
  "46894": "You will not do that?",
  "46895": "And there, don't you see?",
  "46896": "Did you say?",
  "46897": "Oh, what are you doing?",
  "46898": "Where is the corpse lying?",
  "46899": "Is not this so?",
  "46900": "How many of their friends must have fallen in the struggle?",
  "46901": "Do you see this woman sitting beside me?",
  "46902": "And when you see the same evils in the tyrannical man, what do you say of him?",
  "46903": "Are, however, pleasures and pains strictly commensurable?",
  "46904": "Do you hear me?",
  "46905": "My dear fellow, are you really on such good terms with her as to venture to take me to her box?",
  "46906": "How may I aid in the adventure?",
  "46907": "Yes, who are YOU?",
  "46908": "Not serious, I hope?",
  "46909": "Is he here?",
  "46910": "Louisa turned her eyes to his face, and asked him what fault was that?",
  "46911": "Kutuzov?",
  "46912": "What mysterious results was the future reserving for the investigation of science?",
  "46913": "What do you mean by horrid?",
  "46914": "A horse for your lackey?",
  "46915": "How could one fail to understand?",
  "46916": "How's that?",
  "46917": "How long has he been going on thus?",
  "46918": "And that human virtue is justice?",
  "46919": "Who is on duty?",
  "46920": "Did not I say so?",
  "46921": "Do fine work?",
  "46922": "But why did we teach you that?",
  "46923": "Why did they do it?",
  "46924": "Anybody been beating 'ee?",
  "46925": "A bird of the air?",
  "46926": "It would have been terrible if any cloud had come across a friendship like ours, would it not?",
  "46927": "Did not the royal diadem shine in my hair?",
  "46928": "What doom was his own father's?",
  "46929": "Who shall it be if not he who does this work well?",
  "46930": "How many bedrooms?",
  "46931": "Well, you see the hills beyond?",
  "46932": "And can it be my fault, can I have done anything wrong?",
  "46933": "And what if we came too late?",
  "46934": "You have turned full steam on?",
  "46935": "Have you heard?",
  "46936": "Have the humanistic studies not given to him, as to so many of his contemporaries, a distinctive mental bent?",
  "46937": "What interest, let me ask, have the people in the settlement of this question?",
  "46938": "And how should I, having been a hunter all my life?",
  "46939": "Why, what's the matter with you?",
  "46940": "And why, if you knew me, do you let me die?",
  "46941": "But what is to be done?",
  "46942": "You do not doubt that, I hope?",
  "46943": "Is it interesting?",
  "46944": "Eureka?",
  "46945": "What do they call it, that which maketh them proud?",
  "46946": "Why do you think so?",
  "46947": "What is it, dear one?",
  "46948": "Could I retract my word, and take upon myself the responsibility of compromising the future of my companions?",
  "46949": "And is it any better as it is?",
  "46950": "Answer, what?",
  "46951": "But is there no danger from the bite?",
  "46952": "How could I remember you?",
  "46953": "But do you understand me?",
  "46954": "What are we going to do, i'faith?",
  "46955": "Shall I obtain permission not to do so till I have spoken to the king, sire?",
  "46956": "Linon, have you?",
  "46957": "Would you yield to the thirst for gold?",
  "46958": "At what hour did he leave your hotel?",
  "46959": "Yet, if they ask me why I am not dancing, what am I to say?",
  "46960": "Why should you mind what they call it?",
  "46961": "Because I envy you, eh?",
  "46962": "Are you as bad as that?",
  "46963": "Do you think you would?",
  "46964": "Who is there who is not fifty years old?",
  "46965": "Did you come for your interest?",
  "46966": "How d'ye do?",
  "46967": "You heard him?",
  "46968": "Are not these large enough?",
  "46969": "Is it what you call a breakfast cap?",
  "46970": "How's that?",

  "46974": "May I have not my word taken?",
  "46975": "No, where?",
  "46976": "Is it so necessary that I should stop to think of manners and customs?",
  "46977": "Oh, wouldn't you?",
  "46978": "And how is the error to be corrected?",
  "46979": "And what did she do?",
  "46980": "Why doesn't he give me a cheque for the money?",
  "46981": "What d'ye mean?",
  "46982": "Then, are your names, gentlemen?",

  "46986": "Why does it make you angry when you are looked at?",
  "46987": "What do you mean by your insinuations, anyhow?",
  "46988": "You've been dull, I expect?",
  "46989": "But I wonder if she would care to?",
  "46990": "And should you mind that?",
  "46991": "Now, what lunacy has been your latest?",
  "46992": "Well, maman, are you perfectly well?",
  "46993": "For what would they risk their rascal carcasses but money?",
  "46994": "Where has she come from?",
  "46995": "Of the principal?",
  "46996": "You haven't it?",
  "46997": "If the frontier line became the sea coast, what might be looked for then?",
  "46998": "Have you ever noticed them?",

  "47008": "Why did he throw that paper into the sea?",
  "47009": "Are you going to stay a day or two?",
  "47010": "And you are going to say it now?",
  "47011": "Now, if we are equal in that which makes us men, how can the accidental distribution of secondary faculties detract from our manhood?",
  "47012": "Have I the lady's promise for that?",
  "47013": "And why was I arrested?",
  "47014": "It received us poor and destitute, and now what is wanting to us five fellows who fell on it from the sky?",
  "47015": "What shall I do until then?",
  "47016": "What do you mean by a reception?",
  "47017": "Will you come down?",
  "47018": "How did this happen?",
  "47019": "I now in my turn began to inquire where they were bound?",
  "47020": "Will you do me the favour to present my compliments to the constituent body, and acquaint them with this circumstance?",
  "47021": "Would you turn all the youth of the world into a tragic chorus, wailing and moralizing over misery?",
  "47022": "Do you not remember that I one day told you not to make yourself uneasy, if you possessed courage?",

  "47030": "Where the devil are they?",
  "47031": "What is the name of this place?",
  "47032": "Don't you think we may say there does not exist a single person so honest that he has never stolen anything whatever in his life?",
  "47033": "What, my child?",
  "47034": "Is there anyone else around here who might take him?",
  "47035": "Am I not hale in wind and limb?",

  "47037": "Don't you know how wrong it was?",
  "47038": "What have I to do when death takes the place of life?",
  "47039": "Isn't he a duck?",
  "47040": "What are yer talking about?",
  "47041": "Will you be kind enough to listen to me?",
  "47042": "Is it not surprising that any woman could bring herself to write such a letter?",
  "47043": "Why NOT?",
  "47044": "Why was I so long?",
  "47045": "Am I not merely obeying an imperious necessity?",
  "47046": "Where did you meet her?",
  "47047": "Why did you let them do that?",
  "47048": "Was I right?",
  "47049": "There is corn in this, else why the stalk of it?",
  "47050": "What's bothering her?",
  "47051": "For what idea can we form of the soul when separated from the body?",
  "47052": "And if its most certain effect is to ruin those whom it incites, how does it become useful?",
  "47053": "Why did you not let me know sooner that your heart cherished a love which is in opposition to this law?",
  "47054": "Whereabouts in the neighborhood is there an ironmonger's shop?",
  "47055": "Where are we to turn for help?",

  "47064": "What use was there in telling such a tale of love at that time?",
  "47065": "Who else, eh?",
  "47066": "Katerina?",
  "47067": "And do you dream?",
  "47068": "But how can they discharge these duties unless they be themselves protected?",
  "47069": "What boy is that?",
  "47070": "You will not fail in YOUR duty, my son and daughter, I believe?",
  "47071": "Whose is this noble city?",
  "47072": "Well, have you finished your silly joke?",
  "47073": "Don't you know that it is the worst thing in the world, next to wickedness?",
  "47074": "Did she not tell you that you can stay where you are?",
  "47075": "SOLD him?",
  "47076": "What in the devil's name do you want here?",
  "47077": "Just a few oats?",
  "47078": "Which of the two denounced him?",
  "47079": "What meant I to marry?",
  "47080": "What shall we do?",
  "47081": "How do you know he had whiskers like sausages, as you say?",
  "47082": "Since no one knows, what is the use of shutting myself up and brooding over the matter?",
  "47083": "Know you that it is your sentence of death which you are now uttering?",
  "47084": "Will you not both take my mother's carriage?",
  "47085": "Eh, what food?",
  "47086": "Do you wish to speak to me?",
  "47087": "Who had been tried as he had been tried, and had gone through such fire with less loss of intellectual power than he had done?",
  "47088": "Where else should it reside but in those who are to pay the expense?",
  "47089": "Your men will know, then, what they have to do?",
  "47090": "Can you recommend any other place where they take boarders?",
  "47091": "An't I yer master?",
  "47092": "But when be any of you going home?",
  "47093": "Any trade doing here?",
  "47094": "Is it for them that we shed our blood, and exhaust the treasures of our people?",
  "47095": "Why should he frighten them away?",
  "47096": "Is this the soldier?",
  "47097": "What is their fault and what their sin?",

  "47103": "Were you serious?",
  "47104": "Can it be possible?",
  "47105": "Will you let me openly ask you a plain question?",
  "47106": "But, on the other hand, is not their hate equally manifest?",
  "47107": "Can one talk of love in these days?",
  "47108": "Will it not rob the tribe of a great fighter?",
  "47109": "How can I think of the bright side of life when, as you see, I am sitting on a barrel and working in a dirty shed?",
  "47110": "Will you let me try?",
  "47111": "You come and bid me adieu, and are going nowhere?",
  "47112": "Surely I may come and walk in it sometimes?",
  "47113": "But what did you want the carpenter for?",
  "47114": "Where do you live?",
  "47115": "Who did they know that would take it?",
  "47116": "Who is firing?",
  "47117": "That is it, is it not, monseigneur, and I shall have nothing else to do?",

  "47154": "Then no intemperance or madness should be allowed to approach true love?",
  "47155": "Was it a signal?",
  "47156": "Will you allow me to plead my cause like an advocate, or rather like a poor woman?",

  "48762": "Then it's a very merry place, I suppose?",
  "48763": "Suppose the queen should refuse to ratify it?",
  "48764": "And how could you have hoped to escape, after you had struck me thus in the midst of my soldiers?",
  "48765": "What would ye with her, ye queens?",
  "48766": "Did not I say that things would come right of themselves?",
  "48767": "O how could they laugh about it that way?",
  "48768": "I suppose you can stay?",
  "48769": "And why is it contrary, unless it be more shocking than any delicate satire?",
  "48770": "What, then?",
  "48771": "And why does your mother say so?",
  "48772": "Do you know my crime, my lord?",
  "48773": "And was it all because you are so fond of your liberty?",
  "48774": "Had he failed?",
  "48775": "Why was it bad?",
  "48776": "His luggage?",
  "48777": "Do you intend opening the door?",
  "48778": "But wot?",
  "48779": "But why do spirits walk the earth, and why do they come to me?",
  "48780": "Lui, marchand?",
  "48781": "Then what are you going to look for?",
  "48782": "But now what is to be done?",
  "48783": "Is he convicted of robbery?",
  "48784": "Were my parents so, when they gave me to you?",
  "48785": "They do me no harm, I hope?",
  "48786": "Could it be possible?",
  "48787": "And we start in his carriage, then?",
  "48788": "Why in thunder should anyone follow or watch me?",
  "48789": "Nor that?",
  "48790": "Is my house come to that?",
  "48791": "Was she a mental case?",
  "48792": "But you are not so much so on my account?",
  "48793": "Do you want to see me in the prisoner's dock with criminals, in a court of justice?",
  "48794": "Seventeen, you mean?",
  "48795": "I am told it is a delightful place?",
  "48796": "You heard about that, I suppose?",
  "48797": "What did he do yesterday?",
  "48798": "What madness or folly leads me to speak of the faults of others, when there is so much to be said about my own?",
  "48799": "But what's she to do while we're away?",
  "48800": "Was he rehearsing some speech in his sleep, or was it a fragment of a phrase from some newspaper article?",
  "48801": "Can we take him out?",
  "48802": "Why do we hold ourselves under obligations to pass such a law, and abide by it when it is passed?",
  "48803": "Are fires kindled on graves, why, and at what time, and for how long?",
  "48804": "Perhaps you don't care for modern pictures?",
  "48805": "Might I have expected it?",
  "48806": "Who had placed those rocks and stones like cromlechs of prehistoric times?",
  "48807": "Is it heaven that opens before me?",
  "48808": "So you'd have them burned?",
  "48809": "What is that noise?",
  "48810": "Perhaps he would come a little sooner if you were to press it?",
  "48811": "Excellency, how could I, how could I prevent it?",
  "48812": "Do you know what they do?",
  "48813": "How long?",
  "48814": "Why spoil the pleasure of our friends by inflicting on them fashionable toilettes on this day of vigorous exercise in the country?",
  "48815": "Why are you the officer in charge now?",
  "48816": "You like music too?",
  "48817": "ARE we safe?",
  "48818": "Your own little share?",
  "48819": "Would it suit you to see them in the darkness of the night?",
  "48820": "Or doth it sit behind a big stone and catch flies?",
  "48821": "And then will he slay me?",
  "48822": "Regarding that as done, is there nothing I can do for you yourself?",
  "48823": "If he wished to injure it why could he not do it there?",
  "48824": "You won't run away from me when I am with you, will you?",
  "48825": "And it turned out that it was not at all because of you he was taken up?",
  "48826": "What has to be done?",
  "48827": "Why, pray, did you not tell me this, then, but excited with hopes a rustic and aged man?",
  "48828": "Is she HERE?",
  "48829": "The cowardliest?",
  "48830": "Would the doctor assist him in preventing this marriage?",
  "48831": "Is there?",
  "48832": "Yes, but are you good enough for it?",
  "48833": "To seek me?",
  "48834": "It is not he, is it?",
  "48835": "What is life?",
  "48836": "The very course he swung to this day noon?",
  "48837": "Won't you come and live with me for a while?",
  "48838": "Now, what is the difference between such actions, when performed by an uncultivated man, and by one of the higher animals?",
  "48839": "Why don't you come to breakfast, my dear?",
  "48840": "And had I not been miserable with less dishonor, if I had met with a more severe and inhuman enemy?",
  "48841": "Have they fed him?",
  "48842": "But who knows whether then you will still wish to elevate him whom you now love, to be your husband?",
  "48843": "Well, don't you see that that brings it down to two days?",
  "48844": "Is there no other road?",
  "48845": "Do you mean a whopper?",
  "48846": "I live up there, don't I?",
  "48847": "Easy you think, eh?",
  "48848": "And your present happiness, has it softened your heart?",
  "48849": "How dare you think of staying here one moment, and refuse my wife the honours that belong to her as such?",
  "48850": "Anyone else?",
  "48851": "Of spiritual profit?",
  "48852": "What is this bird?",
  "48853": "A professor?",
  "48854": "How are we to know whither chance will carry us?",
  "48855": "Are you stopping here?",
  "48856": "Oh, don't burn 'em up, can't you send 'im word to come and get 'em?",
  "48857": "Or which must end me, a fool's wrath or love?",
  "48858": "Now, has she deserved this punishment?",
  "48859": "And may I not paint one like it for you?",
  "48860": "Why?",
  "48861": "What's the use of a lot of capital lying dead?",
  "48862": "What on earth will they expect me to talk about?",
  "48863": "Are you strong enough to stand?",
  "48864": "So I may give him your word of honour, may I, that in case of extremity you will stand by her?",
  "48865": "Would that do?",
  "48866": "You fear to see my naked blade?",
  "48867": "Didn't you know that?",
  "48868": "My idea?",
  "48869": "Why is she unhappy, I wonder?",
  "48870": "May I use it?",
  "48871": "Have I ever seen one?",
  "48872": "Months?",
  "48873": "You have abandoned the king?",
  "48874": "Where were you when you began to feel bad?",
  "48875": "Isn't tbat funny?",
  "48876": "Who let you loose?",
  "48877": "Is any one the less ill because one does not know the name of one's malady?",
  "48878": "I ridiculous?",
  "48879": "Are you armed?",
  "48880": "Do you know me, madame?",
  "48881": "Crack my son over the head, will you, you hardhearted, murtherin' divil?",
  "48882": "By what wickedness cometh this child here?",
  "48883": "Was he feeling badly?",
  "48884": "Is not this the most profound ignorance of human nature?",
  "48885": "Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?",
  "48886": "Do you think I should remember all about my mother's death if I were out of my mind?",
  "48887": "Do you forget that?",
  "48888": "Was it very edifying and instructive?",
  "48889": "Must this last formality take place in your presence, sir?",
  "48890": "Didn't make you at all uneasy?",
  "48891": "Do you attend the family?",
  "48892": "Who knows, when I shall be at liberty, that I may not satisfy your curiosity?",
  "48893": "Was it the devil who rang it?",
  "48894": "Is it unfaithfulness to my husband?",
  "48895": "The train is at three?",
  "48896": "Did you ever see me carry dishes?",
  "48897": "How is such a man to be worked on?",
  "48898": "What murderous spectacle is this?",
  "48899": "Couldn't you stay?",
  "48900": "What do you suggest?",
  "48901": "Have you nothing to show your cousin anywhere about, not even a rabbit or a weasel's nest?",
  "48902": "Won't you help me?",
  "48903": "Have you ever heard of him?",
  "48904": "Had he not corn enough?",
  "48905": "What weapons shall you select?",
  "48906": "Mamma, how can you go back in that way?",
  "48907": "Then no misfortune has happened to you?",
  "48908": "Is the island inhabited then?",
  "48909": "Who's that curtseying there?",
  "48910": "What happens?",
  "48911": "You have plenty of vermin to deal with, I suppose?",
  "48912": "What have you got to say, sir?",
  "48913": "You have news for me?",
  "48914": "Do you know anything?",
  "48915": "Are we not arriving too late?",
  "48916": "Whence did you get that splendid pipe?",
  "48917": "Just suppose perhaps the baking powder isn't good?",
  "48918": "Is he not?",
  "48919": "Outside?",
  "48920": "Can it be possible we could be like husband and wife, alone, your family with you?",
  "48921": "What is the matter with him?",
  "48922": "Dare I look at her?",
  "48923": "And what are you going to do?",
  "48924": "What does she want now?",
  "48925": "How did yeh git 'way over here, anyhow?",
  "48926": "You will not desert him?",
  "48927": "Do you make money or do you not make it?",
  "48928": "I had seen the man robbed, what else could I have done?",
  "48929": "Don't you believe it even now?",
  "48930": "You're not sending the horses off yet?",
  "48931": "What atones?",
  "48932": "My daughter, my daughter, why did you die?",
  "48933": "What shall we do exactly?",
  "48934": "But what has become of them all?",
  "48935": "But what was it, my love?",
  "48936": "Why does she say that?",
  "48937": "What do you advise me to do?",
  "48938": "And therefore to acknowledge that bad and good are the same?",
  "48939": "Shall I tell him to wait?",
  "48940": "What do we find?",
  "48941": "Is that right?",
  "48942": "Well, my dear, and how are we getting on?",
  "48943": "How many men have you here?",
  "48944": "What are you going as?",
  "48945": "You mean if there's a weak place?",
  "48946": "WHAT OUGHT I TO DO?",
  "48947": "Does he know I am his mother really?",
  "48948": "May I make a compact with you?",
  "48949": "Who and what are the two men of whom you speak?",
  "48950": "What are you saying, doctor?",
  "48951": "Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I WAS uncivil?",
  "48952": "What's this?",
  "48953": "Did you find him?",
  "48954": "Where is he?",
  "48955": "And since when have you become afraid of a quarrel?",
  "48956": "But can't we wait for you while you dress?",
  "48957": "Where are they taking you to, you poor dear?",
  "48958": "Why, how wet it is?",
  "48959": "Ain't that so?",
  "48960": "Suppose he finds out, and your brother, and your betrothed?",
  "48961": "Did he give any explanation of his conduct?",
  "48962": "You didn't think I was going to keep a promise like that?",
  "48963": "Corcoran?",
  "48964": "How ever did you get along in a sledge?",
  "48965": "Ah, indeed?",
  "48966": "Does it exist?",
  "48967": "How many?",
  "48968": "You wouldn't like to be a poet when you grow up?",
  "48969": "Then her life won't be altogether wasted, you think?",
  "48970": "In what manner?",
  "48971": "Will it drive me out of my mind?",
  "48972": "Would she, aunt?",
  "48973": "Pretty?",
  "48974": "Well, have you seen him?",
  "48975": "Is this one also a complementary colour?",
  "48976": "Farebrother?",
  "48977": "I wonder who he was?",
  "48978": "And when can I see this young lady, for whom I already feel so great a sympathy?",
  "48979": "Let him profit by the means as I found out?",
  "48980": "What's that about six pound a year?",
  "48981": "What is it, then, sire?",
  "48982": "You are quite sure that you do not want to sell your land?",
  "48983": "How are delights and miseries to be weighed, and reasonably balanced?",
  "48984": "In exchange for that you refuse me?",
  "48985": "Are you going to tell me that it is impossible?",
  "48986": "May I look?",
  "48987": "Is this the end of all my bursting prayers?",
  "48988": "And what did you learn from him?",
  "48989": "How was the play?",
  "48990": "But does it shut equally well?",
  "48991": "What's yo' name?",
  "48992": "How near do you get to it?",
  "48993": "And who is the magistrate who has reason to complain of the agent?",
  "48994": "Who are you talking of?",
  "48995": "I wonder if I shall ever be happy enough to have real lace on my clothes and bows on my caps?",
  "48996": "Did you think he was too good to go?",
  "48997": "Come, now?",
  "48998": "Marry whom?",
  "48999": "You know his house, don't you?",
  "49000": "Was it not unhealthful?",
  "49001": "What happened during the night?",
  "49002": "If two and two made four when we were happy together, surely they make four now?",
  "49003": "How near to you?",
  "49004": "Has the queen any further commands for me now?",
  "49005": "May it not frighten her terribly?",
  "49006": "And what was the end of this worthy man?",
  "49007": "Are the oysters good?",
  "49008": "Which colour strikes most?",
  "49009": "When the devil would you have a man be afraid but when there is so much cause?",
  "49010": "But what happened ?",
  "49011": "But how came that first note to be inserted in your journal?",
  "49012": "Then addressing herself to me, asked, with ineffable complacency, if I was the person who had been so cruelly used by robbers?",
  "49013": "But why could he not tell you this?",
  "49014": "Unseen then?",
  "49015": "Are you sure you don't mind?",
  "49016": "Will you give me an egg to eat?",
  "49017": "Would she ever live to see it?",
  "49018": "A cart?",
  "49019": "Will you sell your rapier?",
  "49020": "What is the reader's conceived opinion of the duties and labors of a missionary in a heathen land?",
  "49021": "But if his daily death was the theme of the legend, why was it celebrated by an annual ceremony?",
  "49022": "Old fellow, can you let me have thirty pounds?",
  "49023": "How do you manage to get people to talk about it?",
  "49024": "Did not you see me tip you the wink to leave off in time?",
  "49025": "A shilling a leg?",
  "49026": "Rid myself of that nightmare?",
  "49027": "Could there possibly have been a more exact guide?",
  "49028": "Why, do you think I should be any happier if I were to feel disturbed about the excavations you tell me of?",
  "49029": "But how am I to climb?",
  "49030": "What is your love to mine?",
  "49031": "Love covers a multitude of sins, and of whom could you ask more freely than of him?",
  "49032": "Did you observe that man's eyes while he was speaking to us?",
  "49033": "And who is she, this woman that you want to see?",
  "49034": "Still, are they going to do it shortly?",
  "49035": "What do you mean, master of mine?",
  "49036": "And of what other trees?",
  "49037": "May we not conjecture that they belonged to the people who resided in the town, and who were victorious in the engagement?",
  "49038": "Could a man be born to a more perfect glory?",
  "49039": "You are vexed?",
  "49040": "You'll not say anything about it at home, will you?",
  "49041": "To our journey's end?",
  "49042": "Don't you want supper?",
  "49043": "To what unexpected good fortune, to what accident, am I to ascribe this happy meeting?",
  "49044": "How did it fare with the missions in these days of woe and terror?",
  "49045": "And how is everybody?",
  "49046": "Perhaps you'd like to spend a couple of shillings or so, in a bottle of currant wine by and by, up in the bedroom?",
  "49047": "With what object?",
  "49048": "Or is it the matter?",
  "49049": "Do you wish a step, or some place in the government?",
  "49050": "Would it not be better to rest now?",
  "49051": "But what then?",
  "49052": "Am I right or not?",
  "49053": "Why impossible?",
  "49054": "It is agreed, then, that I carry you off with me?",
  "49055": "You don't think one needs the EXPERIENCE of having been married?",
  "49056": "Quite seriously?",
  "49057": "Who should prevent you?",
  "49058": "The vastness of this word?",
  "49059": "Whose horse is waiting at your gate?",
  "49060": "Oh, why should I injure a man both worthy and innocent, who has only done me services and honour?",
  "49061": "Why did you light the thirsty lamp?",
  "49062": "Would he be in time to rescue?",
  "49063": "How did he come to be there?",
  "49064": "Why aren't I good enough to attend her filthy brat?",
  "49065": "The meeting?",
  "49066": "Can't read it?",
  "49067": "Whence doth this aspect horrible proceed?",
  "49068": "Will your majesty deign to excuse me?",
  "49069": "Shall we say it is because we have won an empire?",
  "49070": "What do you talk about?",
  "49071": "Or why should not all the three walk abreast?",
  "49072": "Don't you know how one longs to have something to do for some one who belongs to one?",
  "49073": "And is it so, maidy?",
  "49074": "Were they hungry?",
  "49075": "Won't you stay?",
  "49076": "Has he committed suicide?",
  "49077": "Do your ears tell you that they have traced our retreat?",
  "49078": "What made you sit in such an awkward position?",
  "49079": "Why shouldn't we both be married, instead of sitting through the long winter evenings by our solitary firesides?",
  "49080": "You think me rather parsimonious, don't you?",
  "49081": "Why are you so very shy, and so very sombre?",
  "49082": "Would any one of us be here if we weren't paupers?",
  "49083": "What other initiative, what greater authority, do you ask?",
  "49084": "Why do you serve in this capacity?",
  "49085": "How do you like it?",
  "49086": "What month?",
  "49087": "More than in other years?",
  "49088": "But could he be sure that this was all that was to be said about this enigma, and that he should never arrive at a solution?",
  "49089": "Half a mile, you say?",
  "49090": "Has anything happened, ma'am?",
  "49091": "Where is the man who brought the letter?",
  "49092": "Whither am I going?",
  "49093": "Shall I have it, or shall I not?",
  "49094": "And all my limbs unbroken?",
  "49095": "Why did they?",
  "49096": "Do you know where we could get one?",
  "49097": "Well, and you want your fortune told?",
  "49098": "Was it his wife, or else as like her as any sister could be?",
  "49099": "Does that mean that all men have a right to all property?",
  "49100": "How could she tell where I had got the handkerchief?",
  "49101": "And can bear to have my morsel of bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my cup?",
  "49102": "One thing and another commit?",
  "49103": "Oh, isn't that too bad?",
  "49104": "What troops are these that seem to be passing through the wood?",
  "49105": "You'd never think it to look at me, would you?",
  "49106": "What shall I sing?",
  "49107": "What object could they have?",
  "49108": "And do you suppose she understands nothing?",
  "49109": "Could I have caused that girl's death and procreated this being?",
  "49110": "What do the women find so impressive in that little brat?",
  "49111": "Well, sir?",
  "49112": "And I must cross it with silver, I suppose?",
  "49113": "A letter?",
  "49114": "Whom follow?",
  "49115": "What means this profession of faith?",
  "49116": "His wife?",
  "49117": "What place is that?",
  "49118": "Is not this thing which you advise me to do a little cowardly?",
  "49119": "Who has paid adulation to the nation while claiming for it a sovereignty which it was incapable of exercising?",
  "49120": "Have you not wished to go?",
  "49121": "Died he of sickness or through treachery?",
  "49122": "Isn't this rather sudden?",
  "49123": "To how much?",
  "49124": "Why, why are people all balls of bitter dust?",
  "49125": "You tell me nothing?",
  "49126": "What means this?",
  "49127": "Who calls?",
  "49128": "Why should I deny it?",
  "49129": "What is the matter with them?",
  "49130": "Now, children, which is it to be?",
  "49131": "Is the doctrine warranted by FACTS?",
  "49132": "Then what will you do with me then?",
  "49133": "Can anyone grasp what such an offer meant at such a spot, made to a man who, to tell the truth, is very fond of a smoke after meals?",
  "49134": "From whom had they that information?",
  "49135": "Shall I ever see your sister?",
  "49136": "Then your duchess is still at the waters?",
  "49137": "Have you heard anything of the case?",
  "49138": "Do you wish to try to do so?",
  "49139": "After all, he said in his bitterness, what can a woman care about so much as house and furniture?",
  "49140": "What was his devotion worth to her?",
  "49141": "I suppose I could walk with the rest?",
  "49142": "But why waste more words on them?",
  "49143": "What was it fell last night from the evil moon?",
  "49144": "Well, then, I said, why couldn't she tell her husband to fetch a dog?",
  "49145": "Just as she was, in a manner, pretending to listen?",
  "49146": "Two words?",
  "49147": "It was he who told you to invite me to appear with these studs?",
  "49148": "And how were they treated?",
  "49149": "Do you bring me a message from the king, or have you made a bold hit, and wish me to take you again under my protection?",
  "49150": "Isn't it a terrible thing to die so young as that?",
  "49151": "How many times have we seen it?",
  "49152": "Well, then, what possessed you to go down there this time of night?",
  "49153": "And do you know who is his lieutenant?",
  "49154": "Did not you take heed, quoth he, a little before he opened his mouth to speak, what a shogging, shaking, and wagging his head did keep?",
  "49155": "I suppose that's what your humanity would suggest?",
  "49156": "And are you going away, then, really?",
  "49157": "Do you not know that you have been dead this long time?",
  "49158": "How long a delay do you wish for?",
  "49159": "Well, what will you give for it?",
  "49160": "What evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of your senses?",
  "49161": "But should you not interfere?",
  "49162": "It would trouble me sadly to make him unhappy, for I couldn't fall in love with the dear old fellow merely out of gratitude, could I?",
  "49163": "Where were thy senses?",
  "49164": "Mademoiselle, how could you believe that?",
  "49165": "Do you understand what the word pity means?",
  "49166": "You mean it makes you feel that you have nothing?",
  "49167": "But what about women?",
  "49168": "Besides, how could one land on the opposite bank among willows which would scuttle the boat, and with a flood of unknown extent?",
  "49169": "Have I, indeed, said anything you should answer with such a cruel remark?",
  "49170": "What hinders it?",
  "49171": "Would you care fer any one that took all those?",
  "49172": "You haven't breakfasted?",
  "49173": "So what have you done with it?",
  "49174": "You mean when a woman has children?",
  "49175": "What is there to surprise anyone in that?",
  "49176": "If I only had it here, wretch that I am, what more should we want?",
  "49177": "Well, monseigneur?",
  "49178": "Do you wish me to begin admiring the peoples?",
  "49179": "Do I not myself know that I am at this moment in want of a dozen pages, and that I am sick with cudgelling my brains to find them?",
  "49180": "Which do ye choose?",
  "49181": "Did you observe any one during the first act?",
  "49182": "Have you heard the news?",
  "49183": "And what IS this on my head?",
  "49184": "Why deceive us further?",
  "49185": "And by whom are you forbidden?",
  "49186": "Who has done this?",
  "49187": "And who was that man?",
  "49188": "What happened to you?",
  "49189": "What put her up to clearing out?",
  "49190": "To play blindman's bluff?",
  "49191": "Well, sire?",
  "49192": "Any answer?",
  "49193": "How do you do?",
  "49194": "You wouldn't like your relations to be starved, even if they were only third cousins, would you?",
  "49195": "And so, is it quite certain he is coming?",
  "49196": "If nobody were rich, who would employ the poor?",
  "49197": "And what do you expect the king to reply?",
  "49198": "But if she does?",
  "49199": "Where is he who could say it no?",
  "49200": "I have surely not been dreaming, have I?",
  "49201": "Shall we light a fire, so as to signal our presence on the coast?",
  "49202": "Do you think of dying, my lord?",
  "49203": "What does the poetry or the value of the ring signify?",
  "49204": "What do you believe, what do you KNOW?",
  "49205": "How's my poor brother?",
  "49206": "Is he so hard, then?",
  "49207": "Why did you come?",
  "49208": "Oh, mother, what is the matter?",
  "49209": "And what house is this?",
  "49210": "What, no second club?",
  "49211": "Will fish go down with them?",
  "49212": "May it not, theoretically, include as much of the universe as is known to man?",
  "49213": "Is it my affair?",
  "49214": "I, madame?",
  "49215": "Why should you go about the parish?",
  "49216": "Who is this ancient teacher or who is his prototype if he is an ideal being?",
  "49217": "What could those words mean?",
  "49218": "Did you never do any robbery in your life?",
  "49219": "What devil?",
  "49220": "Why are we less prompt to provide for our own safety than the rest of the citizens?",
  "49221": "I said, do you hear me?",
  "49222": "For what purpose?",
  "49223": "Is his hour past?",
  "49224": "Do you know of any other?",
  "49225": "For how, under different wills, should we find complete unity of ends?",
  "49226": "Did you ever see anything to equal it, as you steam away in the sunset?",
  "49227": "Were you thinking of your birth then?",
  "49228": "Look at a plant in the midst of its range, why does it not double or quadruple its numbers?",
  "49229": "Couldn't he have waited for the good season to increase his chances?",
  "49230": "Am I too heavy?",
  "49231": "Shall we agree to this plan, or not?",
  "49232": "Buy back your wheelbarrow?",
  "49233": "Do they begin by exciting the detestation of the very instruments of their intended usurpations?",
  "49234": "Up so early?",
  "49235": "Do I know you?",
  "49236": "His things and his bag are with him?",
  "49237": "Another shock, eh?",
  "49238": "Can I trust you?",
  "49239": "Other people's?",
  "49240": "And did you see her just now, as she spoke of her father?",
  "49241": "And fought?",
  "49242": "Was there no other who contributed?",
  "49243": "Under what obligation do I lie of making such an abuse of time?",
  "49244": "Could any other man express what they knew so well how to express in tones and in words?",
  "49245": "But what book is that next it?",
  "49246": "It surely cannot be you who made shoes for me at the l'ecole militaire?",
  "49247": "How must I do?",
  "49248": "But how, sir, said I, did you part?",
  "49249": "Where was the first lion?",
  "49250": "When didn't you?",
  "49251": "What is its name?",
  "49252": "That is, you mean that sin keeps him back?",
  "49253": "To whom was this letter addressed?",
  "49254": "Carlo, did I offer any violence?",
  "49255": "Couldn't stand it, eh?",
  "49256": "Who are your uncles and aunts?",
  "49257": "What was he saying yesterday?",
  "49258": "And do you think I ever shall?",
  "49259": "Why do you want me?",
  "49260": "I ask you what year is it?",
  "49261": "What sent you hither?",
  "49262": "Was such a thing ever heard of?",
  "49263": "What had she to do with the justice or injustice of other people?",
  "49264": "Which is it to be, death or life?",
  "49265": "Jule, you won't go, will you?",
  "49266": "How will they proceed?",
  "49267": "Not a cloud?",
  "49268": "What has that boy been about?",
  "49269": "Or any other time?",
  "49270": "Are they not already in the land?",
  "49271": "What did they want there?",
  "49272": "To which?",
  "49273": "The surface of a sphere?",
  "49274": "Are they happy?",
  "49275": "Is it a good road, and how far?",
  "49276": "And the lord chamberlain?",
  "49277": "Mayor?",
  "49278": "Had you ever any reason to complain of him?",
  "49279": "Will you promise me then to be at peace?",
  "49280": "A voyage?",
  "49281": "And they found the child?",
  "49282": "Yet what will the energy of true genius not effect?",
  "49283": "What is there to hinder?",
  "49284": "Is it a lonely farm?",
  "49285": "And can I play with him, too?",
  "49286": "Why do I want to go?",
  "49287": "What business, said she, had you to read my letter?",
  "49288": "Or, if it ought to give any, what are the different parts of education which it ought to attend to in the different orders of the people?",
  "49289": "Why don't he, in such a case, sell his horses, let his house, turn off his servants, and make a thorough reform at once?",
  "49290": "You don't mean to say you have forgotten that you promised to make half a dozen calls with me today?",
  "49291": "What time did he set off for town?",
  "49292": "And are you coming with us?",
  "49293": "When had that question been settled?",
  "49294": "Had he travelled?",
  "49295": "And why have you such an air of sadness aboard?",
  "49296": "And what has become of the business?",
  "49297": "Was it an instant of enchantment only or long hours and years and ages?",
  "49298": "Is the lady so very alarming?",
  "49299": "Your marriage?",
  "49300": "Won't you, young fellow?",
  "49301": "Your aunt?",
  "49302": "By means of what organ?",
  "49303": "What DOES the face matter?",
  "49304": "All of it?",
  "49305": "Is he lost, I wonder, in this desert?",
  "49306": "Can you enlighten me on that point?",
  "49307": "What makes her want to see ye?",
  "49308": "Do you mean to ask this girl to marry you?",
  "49309": "Are you quite well?",
  "49310": "And what this?",
  "49311": "Did not his land produce sufficient of everything?",
  "49312": "When did it break out?",
  "49313": "Why add up the elements of resistance and anarchy?",
  "49314": "And pray, if you are so good, who ventures to affirm that?",
  "49315": "What for?",
  "49316": "What are you thinking of doing?",
  "49317": "How could we live and where could we live?",
  "49318": "Is it so nice as all that?",
  "49319": "But what do I say?",
  "49320": "Or wasn't it meant for my ears?",
  "49321": "Whom does this belong to?",
  "49322": "Who are you, my good man?",
  "49323": "Do they think the prefect will be glad to dine down there under a tent like a gipsy?",
  "49324": "Had I dreamt?",
  "49325": "Why did she so lose courage?",
  "49326": "And can you not understand why I said fortune favours us?",
  "49327": "What's the use of living?",
  "49328": "Are you well and happy?",
  "49329": "What to do?",
  "49330": "Did the sun, which shone so brightly everywhere else, really fall upon him?",
  "49331": "What brings you here, dear heart?",
  "49332": "What were they now?",
  "49333": "I suppose you haven't got a brass farthing, have you?",
  "49334": "You understand what I say?",
  "49335": "Are they in safety?",
  "49336": "Sneezed, did you?",
  "49337": "I'm not?",
  "49338": "Have you forgotten that a son ought to love and honour his father and mother?",
  "49339": "Had the remembrance of her teaching utterly vanished, and the last trace of her maternal influence quite faded away?",
  "49340": "Don't you know the cawing crow lives five times as long as a man?",
  "49341": "What do you want with me?",
  "49342": "You are staying the whole evening, I hope?",
  "49343": "Why shouldn't she like him?",
  "49344": "What weight would that carry?",
  "49345": "Doesn't she look lovely?",
  "49346": "Good gracious, what noise is that?",
  "49347": "Have you seen the princess?",
  "49348": "Is it because there is no word tender enough to be your name?",
  "49349": "Won't you try and care for me a little?",
  "49350": "So you wanted to get away, my dear, did you?",
  "49351": "Did it not show that he comprehended his relations with her?",
  "49352": "What need of positive law where natural justice is, of itself, a sufficient restraint?",
  "49353": "But how was it settled between you, mamma?",
  "49354": "What means this?",
  "49355": "What is it that is strange?",
  "49356": "Coming in to have a short time?",
  "49357": "Do you reproach me?",
  "49358": "And what do you pick your teeth with, after devouring that fat goose?",
  "49359": "Had not his books taught him that he was a man?",
  "49360": "And will you mention to me the yearly sum which would repay you for managing these affairs which we have discussed together?",
  "49361": "What'll be over?",
  "49362": "But then, what are we here for?",
  "49363": "Why shouldn't I have them all to myself?",
  "49364": "You'll wait and wave your handkerchief when I get to that turn in the road?",
  "49365": "Two years ago, wasn't it?",
  "49366": "Now, what do you think the lawyer making the inquiries wants?",
  "49367": "You have?",
  "49368": "De qui?",
  "49369": "What was it, my dear?",
  "49370": "She was young, you say?",
  "49371": "His effect?",
  "49372": "What is life to you?",
  "49373": "Where are you living now?",
  "49374": "How can I tell whet ye say?",
  "49375": "Have they?",
  "49376": "Shall my messenger, in your name, tell your people to give in?",
  "49377": "And does he still tip you?",
  "49378": "If he forsakes his faith, how doth it profit you?",
  "49379": "Why do you do such a strange thing?",
  "49380": "Why did you think so?",
  "49381": "Does he say so now?",
  "49382": "And both should be in harmony?",
  "49383": "Why, you love him, do you not?",
  "49384": "I hope I am doing nothing wrong in asking it again?",
  "49385": "Had he spoken of himself, of himself as he was or wished to be?",
  "49386": "If he did not, what would she do?",
  "49387": "And ought not the same natures to have the same pursuits?",
  "49388": "What next?",
  "49389": "Won't you come to see mamma?",
  "49390": "Why did it happen?",
  "49391": "But our troop horses?",
  "49392": "Nay, tell me, how many histories are there filled with these marvels?",
  "49393": "It's likely, isn't it, then there would be two girls with a name like that?",
  "49394": "Do you mind my smoking?",
  "49395": "How, then, does this passion for gain, abandoned to itself, turn to the prejudice of society?",
  "49396": "If a kiss had been imprinted?",
  "49397": "Well, do you attend the function tonight?",
  "49398": "Whence the cause of this singular intoxication, the consequences of which might have been very disastrous?",
  "49399": "But they have wisdom, else what is the use of having died?",
  "49400": "Always a muddle?",
  "49401": "Have I given no testimony of my sincerity and of my passion?",
  "49402": "That's everything?",
  "49403": "Is this the same lemonade of which you partook?",
  "49404": "And what does he charge?",
  "49405": "But the horses?",
  "49406": "In summer?",
  "49407": "And what the devil was the matter with his head?",
  "49408": "Why do we love?",
  "49409": "And what do the rulers call the people?",
  "49410": "And how much was the residue?",
  "49411": "What do you think he replied?",
  "49412": "Or is it equally criminal in every body?",
  "49413": "Perhaps you think I shall abandon you, dear grandpapa, and that I shall forget you when I am married?",
  "49414": "What's coming next?",
  "49415": "Did your father speak of it?",
  "49416": "What was that noise?",
  "49417": "Your father breaks horses, don't he?",
  "49418": "What made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here?",
  "49419": "An old hag who said her son had the plague?",
  "49420": "How then was it closed?",
  "49421": "What is the cause of all this?",
  "49422": "What do I seek on the height?",
  "49423": "Have the enemy called in any foreign help?",
  "49424": "Will you believe that she never said a prayer in her life till tonight?",
  "49425": "Lost her memory, eh?",
  "49426": "And pray who are the persons who exhaust your fortune?",
  "49427": "You did not recognise me?",
  "49428": "How shall I break through them?",
  "49429": "That your own bunk over on that side?",
  "49430": "Is this a fact?",
  "49431": "But where, where was this self, this innermost part, this ultimate part?",
  "49432": "What have I to consider?",
  "49433": "Had she succeeded in extracting the secret, and awakening in that adamant heart a last faint touch of pity?",
  "49434": "And will you transfer me to your brother?",
  "49435": "Indeed formerly you were wont to give us some freely, and will you not now let us have any for our money?",
  "49436": "How did it come about, I wonder, that the elder officers are not here to interfere with anything you do?",
  "49437": "Natasha, what is it about?",
  "49438": "I may turn my back on this town a few hours sooner than I intended, but what of that?",
  "49439": "How are they?",
  "49440": "Divide it by three, and what is the result?",
  "49441": "Would I speak to you if he did?",
  "49442": "Where shall I go to find you?",
  "49443": "And the casks?",
  "49444": "Said I, is there here a new world?",
  "49445": "Hamlet's which?",
  "49446": "And suppose some learned traveller should come across these specimens, eh?",
  "49447": "Dare you pretend to rouse him against me?",
  "49448": "Is it possible that you consider the sea to be greater now than formerly?",
  "49449": "Where are your reindeer?",
  "49450": "Why was it I wanted to tell him and did not tell him?",
  "49451": "Have I not a wife?",
  "49452": "What time are you supposed to return?",
  "49453": "Why, what are these doing, who are bent down so much?",
  "49454": "Five pounds?",
  "49455": "But why do you wish to bind yourself?",
  "49456": "Say, is it possible?",
  "49457": "You've bought our inn?",
  "49458": "If he were not only to sink from his highest resolve, but to sink into the hideous fettering of domestic hate?",
  "49459": "Must one not surrender his right when he is unable to recover it?",
  "49460": "Why are you so careful, so tender, of this one wrong and no other?",
  "49461": "How am I to pay them?",
  "49462": "You hear that?",
  "49463": "I hope you will not object to my remaining at home, sir?",
  "49464": "And you have brought him back here?",
  "49465": "Should he speak to her?",
  "49466": "And the first?",
  "49467": "How can one describe a man?",
  "49468": "Do you know what you look like, all together, as you are armed and guarded by your lackeys?",
  "49469": "Do you believe him to be implicated?",
  "49470": "Now, what are you waiting for?",
  "49471": "Have you got the pipe?",
  "49472": "Is it surprising, that such a tasteless being should rather caress this dog than her children?",
  "49473": "Of how many does it consist?",
  "49474": "How could they learn, how calculate, in the midst of this night?",
  "49475": "Are not the two sexes made for one another?",
  "49476": "Are these bears here?",
  "49477": "No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of mine?",
  "49478": "When will he come?",
  "49479": "What misfortune has happened then?",
  "49480": "Were they TO BE or BORN TO BE?",
  "49481": "We haven't the dust to bother us, as the men have, and whoever heard of a horse stepping on a man?",
  "49482": "And how far from the edge of the wood?",
  "49483": "When you get through working your horses this fall, will you turn them out in the snow?",
  "49484": "If it's all wrong, why does he read them?",
  "49485": "Why, said I, are you afraid I should confederate with them to commit a robbery upon my master?",
  "49486": "This famous invention of yours?",
  "49487": "Don't you want any?",
  "49488": "But what are you shouting for?",
  "49489": "Or what is your name?",
  "49490": "Do you mind him only having two noises?",
  "49491": "Was that poetry?",
  "49492": "Have we done?",
  "49493": "Why take less critical utilitarians as the only exponents of the school?",
  "49494": "And where do you find them?",
  "49495": "Should he, on the very threshold of such an errand, be afraid?",
  "49496": "Are you married, or are you not?",
  "49497": "The lamps are right, are they?",
  "49498": "For what purpose is your question?",
  "49499": "No luck for old fellows, then, my sweet bud of the wilderness?",
  "49500": "But didn't you yesterday wear a beard, and long hair, and dust in your hair?",
  "49501": "Did the other boys do so?",
  "49502": "Is it possible to transmit a projectile up to the moon?",
  "49503": "Would you like my carbine?",
  "49504": "You spent that cent I give ye, eh, an' got so much that it made ye sick?",
  "49505": "So you do remember some things?",
  "49506": "Don't you like eggs?",
  "49507": "Off I go where?",
  "49508": "And would not my four months' silence appear to him a tacit acceptance of our situation?",
  "49509": "Pray is your lodger within?",
  "49510": "What is easier, you know?",
  "49511": "What, you must leave?",
  "49512": "But how can I?",
  "49513": "What is it you want, dear grandpapa?",
  "49514": "Why don't you drink it?",
  "49515": "Shall the air never again be lighted with the glare of our guns?",
  "49516": "Had this sphinx his fore paws in crime and his hind paws in authority?",
  "49517": "Are you satisfied, you great fool?",
  "49518": "Was he sure of his man?",
  "49519": "Where is the villain?",
  "49520": "Now what is this?",
  "49521": "Did they try to fight you when you saw 'em?",
  "49522": "Your excellency, how come you to be here?",
  "49523": "Well, then, a horse?",
  "49524": "As valiant as was that other?",
  "49525": "Alas, but that sentence is a puddle, is it not?",
  "49526": "I really, my dear, described to you a manner?",
  "49527": "You pelief, ten, in te possibilty of te odd ?",
  "49528": "Why is man, who was born for society, not yet associated?",
  "49529": "Yet in what respect can she be termed good?",
  "49530": "If it makes you invis'ble, why do you eat it?",
  "49531": "When do you wish me to go and find your father?",
  "49532": "And what news hear you?",
  "49533": "Might I see you sew it up?",
  "49534": "Is he a deputy?",
  "49535": "Do say something more?",
  "49536": "You're not afraid of the snow melting first?",
  "49537": "But how?",
  "49538": "But won't you have some tea?",
  "49539": "I'd be a nice sight, wouldn't I, rowing down the pond in a flat?",
  "49540": "Is it very late, mother?",
  "49541": "How are ye, lads?",
  "49542": "What next, I mean?",
  "49543": "Well why don't you DO it?",
  "49544": "And now, what must we do?",
  "49545": "Will this closet suit you, my brother?",
  "49546": "How could I answer?",
  "49547": "What of that?",

  "50350": "O he is, is he?",
  "50351": "Why should we not have stayed there?",
  "50352": "Is all well, sir?",
  "50353": "Perhaps, as you can't sing, you'll tell us a story?",
  "50354": "What was needed for him who, overshadowing others, stood at the head of that movement from east to west?",
  "50355": "Can he be deceitful?",
  "50356": "That will not be humiliating to you?",
  "50357": "You expected it, I suppose?",
  "50358": "Can you wonder?",
  "50359": "Do you mean that he won't go unless I take him?",
  "50360": "Quite calm?",
  "50361": "Did you ever hear it again, before this evening?",
  "50362": "Is there nothing more I can do?",
  "50363": "What do you mean by flopping yourself down and praying agin me?",
  "50364": "A formidable one, eh?",
  "50365": "Was anybody called in question for it?",
  "50366": "What sort of place had I come to, and among what kind of people?",
  "50367": "Was it townees?",
  "50368": "Do ye think any harm will come o't?",
  "50369": "What does he say, what does he say?",

  "50399": "Or do you perhaps believe the whole matter to be already closed?",
  "50400": "Astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?",
  "50401": "And whether the punishment might be for six weeks or for two years, what should be done with the family?",

  "50443": "What is the name to me?",
  "50444": "They have lost their best and bravest, and will the cowards dare to give us battle?",
  "50445": "Why not a tremendous man like him?",
  "50446": "And did you catch any of his words?",
  "50447": "Merchandise, curios?",
  "50448": "I suppose that is all right?",
  "50449": "Why can't you leave him at home?",
  "50450": "Do you think he knows?",
  "50451": "It is extremely curious, is it not?",
  "50452": "Or at least write?",
  "50453": "Yes, but how about the instruments?",
  "50454": "And we shall answer?",
  "50455": "Am I keeping you?",
  "50456": "But what happened after my departure?",
  "50457": "Do you mind my putting on my waterproof and going to see if she got in?",
  "50458": "Does the crime consist in that relation?",
  "50459": "Why not then seek in the latter, the happiness which he had vainly dreamed of finding in the former?",
  "50460": "Will you ask him if I can see him for a moment?",
  "50461": "What is it that you advise and counsel me to do?",
  "50462": "What are you doing that for?",
  "50463": "Aeneid that so, doctor?",
  "50464": "Do you speak the truth, monsieur?",
  "50465": "What words?",
  "50466": "In that case you will send me to the prison, perhaps?",
  "50467": "And now you'll save yerself the trouble, won't ye?",
  "50468": "But why should I die?",

  "50475": "Wasn't he helping you catch the rooster?",
  "50476": "Monopolist or speculator, what matters the name, if you admit the thing?",
  "50477": "In the night?",
  "50478": "Or why would grandfather have been so angry with you?",
  "50479": "Or was it that they understood the answers science gave to these problems in some different, clearer sense than he did?",
  "50480": "Why funny, what is funny?",
  "50481": "Oh, you naughty boy, fie for shame, what do you do so far away from home?",
  "50482": "For the rest, what do you object to in these books?",
  "50483": "You two alone?",
  "50484": "Surely you aren't taking all the stuff in the papers seriously?",
  "50485": "Where was there a more affectionate son, a pleasanter home than hers?",
  "50486": "What do you want of me?",
  "50487": "And shoot him, if guilty?",
  "50488": "Was that you?",

  "50490": "What public person?",
  "50491": "How old was this seductive woman now?",
  "50492": "Who gave you knowledge of your wife's being there?",
  "50493": "Detchard?",
  "50494": "So, then, ye'r fairly sewed up, an't ye?",
  "50495": "What's the matter, what's the matter, mamma?",
  "50496": "You'll let me see you again, won't you?",
  "50497": "No other captive friend to save?",
  "50498": "Who will be there?",
  "50499": "Did you ever see such a brute?",
  "50500": "Did you discover this passage by chance?",
  "50501": "Do you need money?",

  "50503": "Are they all dead?",
  "50504": "How, how am I to tell you what I mean?",
  "50505": "Why shouldn't you suffer?",
  "50506": "Why does he call me a screw?",
  "50507": "But what about birth, mother?",

  "50519": "Is there not more at stake for us than for him?",
  "50520": "That is to say you can readily distinguish a fortress from a simple fortification, such as is allowed to chatelains or vassals?",
  "50521": "Where was thy mother?",
  "50522": "Whom have you instructed to represent your pretended uncle?",
  "50523": "Doesn't that sound sort of elegant and rich?",
  "50524": "Do you want to go?",
  "50525": "Where did she do that?",
  "50526": "What do you mean by that, my darling boy?",

  "50528": "What if we are?",
  "50529": "What was the symbolic signification of a hedgehog?",
  "50530": "Can that be possible?",
  "50531": "Why linger ye?",
  "50532": "Would the search for him be difficult, or long?",
  "50533": "How's that for the first water?",

  "52334": "There has been some new development?",
  "52335": "And now amid these things what shall I say?",
  "52336": "Can you tell what we may have to go through yet?",
  "52337": "How, then, am I going to stop him?",
  "52338": "It isn't true that you are a baron?",
  "52339": "How lost you your name, my most kind virgin?",
  "52340": "Who is to lead, and who to follow?",
  "52341": "Has that infernal dog torn up those geraniums again?",
  "52342": "And our guardian is both warrior and philosopher?",
  "52343": "Well, did you grieve very much for her?",
  "52344": "Are you kidding?",
  "52345": "And what did you do meantime?",
  "52346": "What's that on the arm of the chair, a fur cloak or some beast?",
  "52347": "Now, what can you do?",
  "52348": "You will go down slow, sir, I suppose?",
  "52349": "Whuzzat you say?",
  "52350": "Will you come again and help me to do it?",

  "52367": "Why should I mind?",
  "52368": "You with a pleasant home?",
  "52369": "All alone?",
  "52370": "And have they keys of the grating?",
  "52371": "Don't you think I am?",
  "52372": "And should I always be sitting with you?",
  "52373": "If I do, will you grant me common sense, then, for the future?",
  "52374": "Why, once you are rid of them, should you pester criminals to respect an uncongenial standard of conduct?",
  "52375": "And what is it we are watching for?",
  "52376": "Cannibals?",
  "52377": "On what then are you to live?",

  "52380": "You are wounded?",
  "52381": "Perhaps he would not see her any more?",
  "52382": "Do you complain of that?",
  "52383": "Who has told them not to capture me these twenty times over?",
  "52384": "What is the cause of this exclusion?",
  "52385": "But how came you in the bag?",
  "52386": "Let us hide him away, and who is the wiser?",
  "52387": "How acts the judge?",
  "52388": "And you'll go?",
  "52389": "Have you any ideas?",
  "52390": "You heard?",
  "52391": "What's to be the wonder now?",
  "52392": "But was he himself convinced of the accuracy of this explanation?",
  "52393": "Did you lose some of your teeth, the reason your voice sounds so funny?",
  "52394": "Hang it, what's that?",
  "52395": "How like you them, signior?",

  "52402": "I, sir?",
  "52403": "Is not general incivility the very essence of love?",
  "52404": "You persist, then?",
  "52405": "What is this story?",
  "52406": "So we're as we were?",
  "52407": "Of course he doesn't like it, and what can I say when he comes to me?",
  "52408": "Do you still see as much of him as ever?",
  "52409": "Who would have ever believed it?",
  "52410": "Forever?",
  "52411": "You are happy, my dear father?",
  "52412": "Can I spare the time to walk with you, sir?",
  "52413": "Why didn't you come in afore?",
  "52414": "You know, I suppose, who I married?",
  "52415": "Must not people take their chances in this world?",
  "52416": "Where were you, then?",
  "52417": "You won't leave me, general, will you?",
  "52418": "Is there life in the moon?",
  "52419": "How is that?",
  "52420": "What's his game in the matter?",
  "52421": "But what had it to do with the crime?",
  "52422": "Well, if you did?",
  "52423": "Why don't you put him to something?",
  "52424": "And you said nothing?",
  "52425": "Well, are you ready?",
  "52426": "Can you get near enough to throw shells into the city?",
  "52427": "How could they then prevent the pirates from landing?",
  "52428": "Shall we expect some transatlantic military giant to step the ocean and crush us at a blow?",
  "52429": "Why didn't you bring it?",
  "52430": "Do you call it a cheerful language, now?",
  "52431": "Some poetry?",
  "52432": "Was it possible for me to expect in a lady of such high rank, a constancy proof against my want of address to support it?",

  "52436": "Where, sire?",
  "52437": "What do you mean by wrong?",
  "52438": "Has he not thrice refused?",
  "52439": "O, whither shall I flee?",
  "52440": "But what did that amount to?",
  "52441": "Can you produce him?",
  "52442": "What's amiss now, eh?",
  "52443": "If I am here at six it will do, I suppose?",
  "52444": "What else do we need?",
  "52445": "Aren't you hungry?",
  "52446": "But shall I put my foot on his neck, I, of all men, when he is falling a prey to the intrigues of a pack of women and clerks?",
  "52447": "That surprises you, does it?",
  "52448": "If there be no life similar to ours in animals, how could we sustain our life by subsisting on them?",
  "52449": "Could this be a desirable condition for a young country to be in?",
  "52450": "How, then, could the attractiveness of labor serve us as a principle and lever, when it is still our object and our end?",
  "52451": "Finished with your uncle?",
  "52452": "Do the pale faces love their children less in the morning than at night?",
  "52453": "Were his companions dead with him?",
  "52454": "Boots, clothes, bread?",
  "52455": "In all candor let me ask, was such a system for benefiting the few at the expense of the many ever before devised?",
  "52456": "Would they perceive peoples, herds of lunar animals, towns, lakes, seas?",
  "52457": "Ha?",

  "52465": "Have you got a sore throat?",
  "52466": "Are you settisfawd nah?",
  "52467": "And what are you blushing for again?",
  "52468": "What's going on?",
  "52469": "Shall we go?",
  "52470": "But under such circumstances, what could one do?",
  "52471": "And can he ever join his father in punishing me?",
  "52472": "What is the bond of corporations?",
  "52473": "Is there anything I can order for you?",
  "52474": "Oh do you?",
  "52475": "Aren't you frightened, eh?",
  "52476": "Have you never said a word on the matter?",
  "52477": "I understand that they have had brokers in the house?",
  "52478": "You may remember me?",
  "52479": "What powerful motives did I not call to my mind to stifle it?",
  "52480": "Well, what are you waiting for?",
  "52481": "What are you doing, pray, you fellow on the roof?",
  "52482": "There, truly, he is coming?",
  "52483": "Pray has this girl been found?",
  "52484": "Pressed by such arguments as these, what could a weak man do but yield?",
  "52485": "How can I expect a better match for her?",
  "52486": "If I should follow the two fugitives to the end of their journey?",
  "52487": "I, master?",
  "52488": "Should she take to her bed and grow thin?",

  "52491": "What is the object of medical education?",
  "52492": "He's not going to die at once, I should think, is he?",
  "52493": "Mary, you heard that?",
  "52494": "But do you know in what manner I will make amends for my faults during the short space of time I have to remain near to you?",
  "52495": "Will they not be sophisms captivating to the ear, having nothing in them genuine, or worthy of or akin to true wisdom?",
  "52496": "What have you to say against him?",
  "52497": "Who still wanteth to obey?",

  "52501": "Can't you see my point?",
  "52502": "I don't know what you would have?",
  "52503": "Is that the way?",
  "52504": "Then what do I recommend?",
  "52505": "Who can have authorized such an institution?",
  "52506": "Not the drains, I hope?",
  "52507": "What have you done with your candle?",
  "52508": "Yes, but what is a girl to do who has no family?",
  "52509": "Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of it?",
  "52510": "Ever since I come here, you've been out of your senses, and what would have been the good of telling you then?",
  "52511": "And you receive silver from that man?",
  "52512": "Shall I say imprisonment?",
  "52513": "Does it indeed?",
  "52514": "In other terms, is it not the absolute, of which we are only the relative?",
  "52515": "Look, comes he not?",
  "52516": "What is there new in this?",
  "52517": "What will you do with him, madame?",
  "52518": "How can it be lawful that this youth should live for a single hour?",
  "52519": "Where was the eye of your father this day, that it might have seen you?",

  "52556": "Perhaps you don't even love her?",
  "52557": "Sore?",
  "52558": "Might I not myself be mistaken?",
  "52559": "How could we know it?",
  "52560": "Who will affirm that I intended to take possession of this ship and deliver it into the hands of the convicts?",

  "52655": "For what purpose?",
  "52656": "Why then haven't you told me about her before?",
  "52657": "Had we the knowledge at our birth, or did we recollect the things which we knew previously to our birth?",
  "52658": "But are you sure it's he?",
  "52659": "What on earth does this mean?",
  "52660": "What was it?",
  "52661": "For why should I give myself so much labor and so much of sorrow?",
  "52662": "What care I about their objecting?",
  "52663": "What, are people assassinated here?",
  "52664": "Do you believe that the authorities are friendly to us?",

  "53544": "Anything I like?",
  "53545": "Micawber?",
  "53546": "Are you a large party?",
  "53547": "What were our feelings at that moment?",
  "53548": "Where are you running to?",
  "53549": "A document?",
  "53550": "Do you not reckon me?",
  "53551": "MATERIALS?",
  "53552": "Will any antiquarian inform us, if possible, why these bones were placed here?",
  "53553": "And what do you call these, my darling?",
  "53554": "As to you, monseigneur?",
  "53555": "And had he any right to ask her for a revelation of feelings which she had evidently intended to withhold from him?",
  "53556": "Which of the three is it?",
  "53557": "What do I say?",
  "53558": "And you heard what he said?",
  "53559": "Will you give them to me?",
  "53560": "Well, and what have you been doing?",
  "53561": "Why are there no daffodils now?",
  "53562": "Is it not a happy feeling?",
  "53563": "Why sacrifice forty?",
  "53564": "Where's that ten cents?",
  "53565": "And if he left off dreaming about you, where do you suppose you'd be?",
  "53566": "With your brother?",
  "53567": "Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy?",
  "53568": "Now, dear, what are your own?",
  "53569": "I suffer from emotion?",
  "53570": "What laws are there for us?",
  "53571": "And shall she have the head she covets?",
  "53572": "Would she go out to work again?",
  "53573": "Where did I disappear to?",
  "53574": "And you have no way to get news of them?",
  "53575": "Again the law?",
  "53576": "Aunt, will you have some beef?",
  "53577": "Saw her?",
  "53578": "But I must know that you love me, mustn't I?",
  "53579": "Shall we get out and try to find the road?",
  "53580": "You found something compromising?",
  "53581": "Do you see this letter?",
  "53582": "The gentleman who receives us?",
  "53583": "Where de debble did you come frum?",
  "53584": "Has my father asked you for money?",
  "53585": "Who are you, that you should question the judgment of the nations and the ages?",
  "53586": "What would they do in that case?",
  "53587": "You have not counted me out as equal to so much land, and calculated on me as a balance at your banker's?",
  "53588": "Do you know what this plant is?",
  "53589": "Was he awake, or was it but a dream?",
  "53590": "I wonder where we can go next?",
  "53591": "Are you thinking, if I'm drunk itself, I'd leave my daughter living single with a little frisky rascal is the like of you?",
  "53592": "And what awaits you if you remain faithful to your oath, and obey the commands given you?",
  "53593": "Sire, have you in the army one regiment on which you can implicitly rely?",
  "53594": "Will it take long?",
  "53595": "What's that pump stopping for?",
  "53596": "But then, why do you repulse me?",
  "53597": "Are you willing?",
  "53598": "Have I any?",
  "53599": "I wish you'd lend me half a sovereign, will you?",
  "53600": "No, really?",
  "53601": "Can't you see those good people, with a totally strange woman bursting into their house?",
  "53602": "Has he left you for another?",
  "53603": "Can we really affect the adversary's will?",
  "53604": "Shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the sea?",
  "53605": "Was it possible for her to forgive him?",
  "53606": "D'you like all that frilly, bunchy stuff at the throat?",
  "53607": "What purpose do they serve?",
  "53608": "Oh is it?",
  "53609": "Were all those dear, sorrowful, valiant, charming or tragic beings merely dreams?",
  "53610": "Is there anything of the feminine gender among them?",
  "53611": "Lodging?",
  "53612": "Not his brother?",
  "53613": "And which of them made this passage?",
  "53614": "Not more?",
  "53615": "Has he been examined by any synod or council?",
  "53616": "Have you any objection to see him in my presence?",
  "53617": "But what about them at home?",
  "53618": "What is the difference between light and the lustre which is seen on the polished surface of opaque bodies?",
  "53619": "Now, ma'am, am I a fool?",
  "53620": "You know who that is?",
  "53621": "Had she left no friends, no relations behind her?",
  "53622": "What are you doing?",
  "53623": "You will, won't you, dear?",
  "53624": "You'll take me as I am, with nothing?",
  "53625": "Things are all right with you then?",
  "53626": "Ought he to turn to the left or to the right?",
  "53627": "Who dares?",
  "53628": "But how did you manage it, little pa?",
  "53629": "Some what?",
  "53630": "Do you give it to me?",
  "53631": "Tell me, are you human, or are you more than human?",
  "53632": "And you have not made her speak?",
  "53633": "Took hold of you?",
  "53634": "Have you not talked long enough to drink?",
  "53635": "How can you be so cruel to me?",
  "53636": "Are you better?",
  "53637": "Who is it that you have fallen in love with, my poor fellow?",
  "53638": "Come, come, who did you think we were when you ran away from us?",
  "53639": "But what do you require of me, then?",
  "53640": "Do you like roses?",
  "53641": "Not just yet?",
  "53642": "Was there ever a loser content with the loss of the game?",
  "53643": "Going?",
  "53644": "What's the colour of their stockings?",
  "53645": "Why do you look at us like that?",
  "53646": "Does his daughter know of the relapse?",
  "53647": "Is it not a pity that people who are bright and clever should so often be exceedingly improper?",
  "53648": "What did it all mean?",
  "53649": "Would you like a little mash?",
  "53650": "And what salary do you ask?",
  "53651": "I s'pose you'll be starting off for college in a fortnight's time?",
  "53652": "Did you see a young lad passing this way in the early morning or the fall of night?",
  "53653": "How can you say so?",
  "53654": "Could inertia of race, on such a scale, be broken up, or take new form?",
  "53655": "And how did he treat you?",
  "53656": "You, dear mamma?",
  "53657": "What line shall you take, then?",
  "53658": "Towards a new sun?",
  "53659": "May I come in, guardian?",
  "53660": "Has he finished his turn?",
  "53661": "Mahotin?",
  "53662": "Yet why did he come?",
  "53663": "There are those sharks now over the side, don't you see they prefer it tough and rare?",
  "53664": "If you decide to go, why shouldn't you go in the same ship?",
  "53665": "Is it as bad as all that?",
  "53666": "How old are you and what's your name?",
  "53667": "Are the others coming out?",
  "53668": "Are you certain that you can afford to part with so much money, and that it is right that it should be so expended?",
  "53669": "Queer notion, wasn't it?",
  "53670": "Was that last night?",
  "53671": "Is my pa in, do you know?",
  "53672": "Is that all?",
  "53673": "Won't you join us?",
  "53674": "Was this ever possible?",
  "53675": "Their hair?",
  "53676": "Did they leave these two industries to themselves?",
  "53677": "Do they by attaching to the soul and inhering in her at last bring her to death, and so separate her from the body ?",
  "53678": "Have you been slightly dazzled at the sudden fusion of my ingots?",
  "53679": "Perhaps you did not like it?",
  "53680": "Did he look in this way?",
  "53681": "To me?",
  "53682": "But, look here, are you a great hand with the ladies?",
  "53683": "Have you?",
  "53684": "Was he a man or only a crosseyed thief an a loafer?",
  "53685": "Is that all the story?",
  "53686": "None of it at all?",
  "53687": "And how do you find home, now you have come back to it?",
  "53688": "Do you suppose you could find any good in a child by whipping him?",
  "53689": "Is it the secret instinct of decaying nature, or the soul's impulsive throb, as immortality draws on?",
  "53690": "Who was the youth he had adopted and who bore so striking a resemblance to him?",
  "53691": "You wouldn't like to marry a small tradesman or a working man, would you?",
  "53692": "And his offence?",
  "53693": "Are you sure you are not making a mistake?",
  "53694": "You mean your papers?",
  "53695": "It is a poor conclusion, is it not?",
  "53696": "It may also be called temperate, and for the same reasons?",
  "53697": "Don't you think agricultural laborers would rather have three acres and a cow than three acres of printed forms and a committee?",
  "53698": "But surely this is somewhat irrelevant?",
  "53699": "Was it very vile to be dragged back here again?",
  "53700": "Can you break an engagement off slowly?",
  "53701": "Do you wish to ruin us outright?",
  "53702": "Any how does she do?",
  "53703": "You called me a creature of civilization, or something, didn't you?",
  "53704": "Neckett's children?",
  "53705": "Safe?",
  "53706": "My friends, why do I wish for peace?",
  "53707": "Won't you even stay for tea?",
  "53708": "Can he speak?",
  "53709": "And why not with you?",
  "53710": "Well, do you like it?",
  "53711": "What was she to do?",
  "53712": "But can you make any sense out of them?",
  "53713": "He was not playing, then?",
  "53714": "Rosamond a sufferer, a labourer, a female apostle?",
  "53715": "Who could grant them?",
  "53716": "What were you saying about being married?",
  "53717": "That's it, ain't it?",
  "53718": "Was he engaged in a struggle with some animal whose retreat he had disturbed?",
  "53719": "But certain, if execution be remiss or blindfold now, and in this particular, what will it be hereafter and in other books?",
  "53720": "Did he sign, too?",
  "53721": "You're not angry with me any more?",
  "53722": "How long will this fuse burn?",
  "53723": "Why do you hesitate?",
  "53724": "How can I ever describe the charm and picturesqueness of that summer life?",
  "53725": "May I write to you?",
  "53726": "This will be your luggage, I suppose?",
  "53727": "How could that bring you?",
  "53728": "But all our praises why should lords engross?",
  "53729": "And what then would you say?",
  "53730": "What is your opinion on the matter?",

  "53732": "Where is the entrance?",
  "53733": "The barricade?",
  "53734": "What is life at all?",
  "53735": "If you please, sir, should I have no brandy nor nothing to give the poor creetur?",
  "53736": "Is he kind to her?",
  "53737": "Who is conducting the prosecution?",
  "53738": "Is it mingled with anger or hate?",
  "53739": "What had he to do, indeed?",
  "53740": "Why, what, madam, does it signify what I think?",
  "53741": "Will it be believed that the night of so brilliant a day was for me a night of anguish and perplexity?",
  "53742": "Is not this an agreeable surprise?",
  "53743": "What can you not understand?",
  "53744": "Yes, but where?",
  "53745": "What did you burn 'em for?",
  "53746": "But what does that signify?",
  "53747": "Has it indeed?",
  "53748": "What do you want, sir?",
  "53749": "How did that help you?",
  "53750": "Let me hear it?",
  "53751": "But then again, what has the whale to say?",
  "53752": "What power?",
  "53753": "Surely he has some opinion?",
  "53754": "Will it be soon?",
  "53755": "Must I, then?",
  "53756": "Do you call that nourishment?",
  "53757": "What WERE these things?",
  "53758": "Polo?",
  "53759": "Does he like the moor?",
  "53760": "What, dares the villain write in such base terms?",
  "53761": "But what can I do?",
  "53762": "You are quite sure?",
  "53763": "Publish what, you unreasonable man?",
  "53764": "And where do you come from?",
  "53765": "What letter do you mean she returned unopened?",
  "53766": "Why should I not stay here?",
  "53767": "Whence did our servitude commence?",
  "53768": "You insist?",
  "53769": "What's the motive?",
  "53770": "Could he not hinder that, by persuading her out of her system of privation?",
  "53771": "Well, mon cher, what are you doing personally?",
  "53772": "Do you propose to me to do so, D'Artagnan?",

  "53786": "Look?",
  "53787": "Do you understand, officer?",
  "53788": "From your husband?",
  "53789": "And who are you to teach me?",
  "53790": "Don't you expect to see him?",
  "53791": "You went home?",
  "53792": "Is not that stonework?",
  "53793": "You order me to receive his friends, too, I suppose?",
  "53794": "Have you any?",
  "53795": "Why should I stay here alone?",
  "53796": "Is my lord pleased with his escort?",
  "53797": "Who will lead us through the land?",
  "53798": "Is it a holiday?",
  "53799": "But where did he find it?",
  "53800": "Then I am not like him, am I?",
  "53801": "Have I a friend here?",
  "53802": "On an omnibus?",
  "53803": "And for what reason?",
  "53804": "You don't know I quit the seminary?",
  "53805": "And in our opinion the guardians ought to have both these qualities?",

  "53814": "May we talk?",
  "53815": "What were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss?",
  "53816": "So much has been said and sung of beautiful young girls, why don't somebody wake up to the beauty of old women?",
  "53817": "Or is it the master who has not understood his dog?",
  "53818": "Will you be improved?",
  "53819": "Are you rich, that you may pay for courtiers?",
  "53820": "Don't you think you are?",
  "53821": "Why do you not go back?",
  "53822": "But tell me all about it?",
  "53823": "And why do you mean to do such a horrible thing?",
  "53824": "What do YOU think of what the prince has just been saying?",
  "53825": "What need you fear?",

  "53835": "What million?",
  "53836": "Will you then, in the presence of these two friends, accept me as your future husband, and plight me your vow of truth and love?",
  "53837": "Why are we to love prejudices, merely because they are prejudices?",

  "53859": "Nor running a chance of arrest?",
  "53860": "Who said I wanted to?",
  "53861": "Impossible?",
  "53862": "But wherefore do I awake this remembrance?",
  "53863": "But why are you going?",

  "53871": "What is it but the worst and last form of intellectualism, this love of yours for passion and the animal instincts?",
  "53872": "But what do you mean?",
  "53873": "With this conviction, would he have left the head apothecary in that town?",
  "53874": "Theatres, evening parties, dinners in town?",
  "53875": "What atonement shall we offer him?",
  "53876": "Does HE suppose that people will pay him only to come and sit with them and go away again?",

  "53892": "What did they call the wretched being?",
  "53893": "Did he not make speeches in the lobby to show how villainous that decision was, and how it ought to be overthrown?",
  "53894": "When do you go back again?",
  "53895": "What say they?",
  "53896": "Doesn't that a good deal depend on the sort of thing it may be?",

  "54741": "What can I do sir?",
  "54742": "Should I have remained in that house, near you and them, if I did not love them?",
  "54743": "And this letter?",
  "54744": "What d'you charge for a ride, boss?",
  "54745": "What is the matter?",
  "54746": "And if it be so, what is it?",
  "54747": "Mother, what are you crying for?",
  "54748": "Were I to allow you to march out, what security can I have that you will not join them, and afterwards fight against me?",
  "54749": "Reinforcements?",
  "54750": "What would it be right to do?",
  "54751": "What's up with you?",
  "54752": "Should it ever be said that he had robbed those old men, whom he so truly and so tenderly loved in his heart of hearts?",
  "54753": "What made you think he'd ceased to take any interest in the case?",
  "54754": "Is it anything I have done that has pulled you down like that?",
  "54755": "What could my father mean by sending me to be an inmate in this strange family?",
  "54756": "You mean you'll have no quarrel with me?",
  "54757": "Was he awake or was he asleep?",
  "54758": "Well, but if I bought the mill, and allowed your husband to act as my manager in the same way, how then?",
  "54759": "What am I to do if I love him and the other one too?",
  "54760": "And have you come from far like this?",
  "54761": "And what did I tell 'ee?",
  "54762": "Could she, who had been so active in the getting up of the funeral triumph, do less than exult?",
  "54763": "Who now will tell the ladies that I would hie me thither?",
  "54764": "What is genius?",
  "54765": "You have taken care, I hope, of the casket I sent you to lock up?",
  "54766": "What evils?",
  "54767": "And is it wounded?",
  "54768": "What recollections of boyhood and innocence might have been flitting across his brain?",
  "54769": "What noise is that?",
  "54770": "No dignity in whaling?",
  "54771": "Why could they not wait a little?",
  "54772": "No apology, I suppose?",
  "54773": "What are you thinking of?",
  "54774": "How have I offended?",
  "54775": "Why should we be unable to preserve a remembrance of them?",
  "54776": "There is something else you wanted to say?",
  "54777": "Was I not right in saying at the outset that, relatively to the tax, we are behind our institutions?",
  "54778": "What charge, sir?",
  "54779": "Did you see no one?",
  "54780": "Ah, now, couldn't you take me with you?",
  "54781": "Oh, may I get this rose?",
  "54782": "He asked me whether I would go with him?",
  "54783": "A'n't you getting all you hoped for, ay, and more than you hoped for?",
  "54784": "Why did you leave him on the road?",
  "54785": "And in such a case what is one to say?",
  "54786": "Yes, why?",
  "54787": "To which of us?",
  "54788": "Could we not break it?",
  "54789": "What does he drink?",
  "54790": "But however are you going to race in this mud?",
  "54791": "Is this the part of wise men, engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty?",
  "54792": "Cannot you describe her?",
  "54793": "And that which is not more or less a harmony is not more or less harmonized?",
  "54794": "A joke?",
  "54795": "What is his folly?",
  "54796": "I must, then, remain here?",
  "54797": "Who were they?",
  "54798": "Mercenary, mem?",
  "54799": "Well then, my dear, why don't you praise the neatness and prettiness with which it's kept?",
  "54800": "Have you not read in my eyes that there is nothing but devotion and sympathy in my heart?",
  "54801": "Is that worth talking about and making so much ado?",
  "54802": "When are you starting?",
  "54803": "You want no treasures and no castles?",
  "54804": "You will live on our selection, won't you?",
  "54805": "He wouldn't have so much influence, then, don't you reckon?",
  "54806": "Now then, gentlemen, shall I break the seal or not?",
  "54807": "It must have been on the boulevard?",
  "54808": "Could a statue of marble have been more impassive and more mute?",
  "54809": "Would you like to?",
  "54810": "Do you call yourself a raw country girl?",
  "54811": "And, then, do you think that my stumps are pretty?",
  "54812": "But do you fail to live?",
  "54813": "Sure it's he?",
  "54814": "Whose fault?",
  "54815": "She has formed no other attachment?",
  "54816": "What matter?",
  "54817": "And wherefore has he not been to see me?",
  "54818": "Shall we really try it?",
  "54819": "Doth any praise himself?",
  "54820": "Now, then, where's the first boy?",
  "54821": "What has age to do with it?",
  "54822": "What besides?",
  "54823": "Separate, my dear?",
  "54824": "Now, why don't you take my advice?",
  "54825": "Do you wish I hadn't come?",
  "54826": "And alone?",
  "54827": "Why should I pull her into it?",
  "54828": "No cheering news, then?",
  "54829": "And with what object?",
  "54830": "Monks would never learn how you knew what you do?",
  "54831": "What do you keep SAYING you will for?",
  "54832": "Was it so?",
  "54833": "But the earl?",
  "54834": "Do you see, now, one reason why I have let you go thus early into the world?",
  "54835": "Will you show me your plan?",
  "54836": "Can't one cut pages with a garden knife?",
  "54837": "What needs appealing in a fact so plain?",
  "54838": "And if he have great riches, to you leave him all his wealth, or do you make him a beggar?",
  "54839": "Bast?",
  "54840": "What was it you wanted to ask, sir?",
  "54841": "Did you ever hear such a name?",
  "54842": "Can it attack it beneath the waves?",
  "54843": "To those who love as ourselves, in what respect differs a year from an hour?",
  "54844": "And you think that just?",
  "54845": "You will start at once?",
  "54846": "To what point of the continent?",
  "54847": "From whence can she come?",
  "54848": "Will you play?",
  "54849": "What's to hinder 'em from cutting right and left if they begin?",
  "54850": "Give up the parish altogether?",
  "54851": "And what was the policy of that ally?",
  "54852": "But who should tell him so?",
  "54853": "Her voice when she talked to them?",
  "54854": "Would the militia, in this supposition, be more ready or more able to support the federal authority than in the case of a general union?",
  "54855": "Is he in favor of all these things at once?",
  "54856": "Or show you restless, miswandering, misclimbing ones, new and easier footpaths?",
  "54857": "Do you think the thing possible?",
  "54858": "Is the door shut?",
  "54859": "But what will you do?",
  "54860": "Well, then, have you any better plan to propose?",
  "54861": "What, have you a wife, then?",
  "54862": "But does nothing depend on it for them?",
  "54863": "You are well?",
  "54864": "You do love me still?",
  "54865": "Where do your excellencies wish to go?",
  "54866": "Then what the devil brought you here, being a churchman?",
  "54867": "You know what to beautify is, I suppose?",
  "54868": "How can I commit such treachery?",
  "54869": "And what is it doing in the world?",
  "54870": "Do you know, sir?",
  "54871": "And what does it amount to, after all?",
  "54872": "By his son, sir?",
  "54873": "But how, madame?",
  "54874": "What course is that?",
  "54875": "What did the gardener say?",
  "54876": "Why cucumber sandwiches?",
  "54877": "A duel, you mean?",
  "54878": "But what is thy name?",
  "54879": "Ma foi, what rival?",
  "54880": "An't that as nat'ral as walking, and as good for the health?",
  "54881": "Do I then strive after HAPPINESS?",
  "54882": "One should never admit anything in electioneering matters, should one?",
  "54883": "Is she game for that?",
  "54884": "Is it void of understanding?",
  "54885": "And who dictated it?",
  "54886": "Was it not this?",
  "54887": "Who's there?",
  "54888": "What next, I wonder?",
  "54889": "What ails you?",
  "54890": "But what of that, so long as it tickles the palate more strongly?",
  "54891": "Is the sea not full of green islands?",
  "54892": "Whence then this obvious DISQUALITY?",
  "54893": "There is a deficit, you say?",
  "54894": "And is it the case now?",
  "54895": "Because you can see she is in love with you?",
  "54896": "Who was the man?",
  "54897": "Where does he tempt one to stray from duty?",
  "54898": "What does it strike you that I've done?",
  "54899": "Money down?",
  "54900": "Jane's mother is going to let her have a birthday party?",
  "54901": "Have you not shelter, and food, and leisure?",
  "54902": "And what can be said in, at least, partial defence of the actual historical procedure of the nations?",
  "54903": "What should I get by sending to you?",
  "54904": "Sailors?",
  "54905": "You found her well and awaiting you?",
  "54906": "Where is it located?",
  "54907": "Didn't the cavalry all start this morning?",
  "54908": "Why, what do you mean?",
  "54909": "What other men can be thirty leagues under ground?",
  "54910": "What, is it laborers they want for the harvest?",
  "54911": "Who shall describe the anxiety, the agony, which in some measure must have been the lot of every frontier family?",
  "54912": "Why didn't we think of that before?",
  "54913": "What the devil are you doing there in such an agitated manner?",
  "54914": "And what will that signify to me?",
  "54915": "Why will you be silent?",
  "54916": "How then stands the case?",
  "54917": "And you think it funny, no doubt?",
  "54918": "What is gentleness?",
  "54919": "Do you wish this change so very much, sir?",
  "54920": "Do you think I can teach a small school?",
  "54921": "What can I do, my son?",
  "54922": "For a more active primate?",
  "54923": "What on earth is up?",
  "54924": "Where are you going, then, dear bear?",
  "54925": "Shall we have them sit up to the table and serve them with the complete dinner, enlivening it with intellectual conversation?",
  "54926": "Well, fwiend?",
  "54927": "And papa's written consent?",
  "54928": "How could he have been so forgetful?",
  "54929": "And taking it as a story, what do you think of it?",
  "54930": "Can he be afraid of this boy?",
  "54931": "How about returning?",
  "54932": "Don't you mean the composition pedals?",
  "54933": "Well, what is there surprising in that?",
  "54934": "Do you see any objection?",
  "54935": "I wonder when he got the message?",
  "54936": "You hadn't?",
  "54937": "You will, of course, command it yourself?",
  "54938": "What in the name heaven shall I do?",
  "54939": "What is the process for releasing a prisoner?",
  "54940": "O, what's up now?",
  "54941": "I mean, have you ever been where there's water?",
  "54942": "How could I forget it?",
  "54943": "And where is her husband?",
  "54944": "Thomasin, do you know that they have had a bitter quarrel?",
  "54945": "So you're in the washing business, ma'am?",
  "54946": "And I am to hide my guilt, as I have done so many years?",
  "54947": "Pray what was his offence?",
  "54948": "Was it possible he had deceived himself so utterly about her?",
  "54949": "What was it you put on that chair near the window?",
  "54950": "Who else is it?",
  "54951": "Why should I try to shield him from the consequences of his own wicked acts?",
  "54952": "When do you think of setting out?",
  "54953": "Would your dog go with him?",
  "54954": "Where's mother?",
  "54955": "Of the long ago?",
  "54956": "Do you own a dog?",
  "54957": "You begin to see?",
  "54958": "Is it not evil, only evil, and that continually?",
  "54959": "What's the good of sending him away?",
  "54960": "What did they wish to say that their faces were so strange?",
  "54961": "Why is one born with good tendencies and another with evil ones?",
  "54962": "What evil has befallen our royal house?",
  "54963": "Are you certain of that?",
  "54964": "What was there after all?",
  "54965": "Clara, my love, have you forgotten?",
  "54966": "Was he to send out privy seals?",
  "54967": "Is that the case?",
  "54968": "What's the matter with you?",
  "54969": "Who can look at these rocks, and allow the voluptuousness of nature to be an excuse for gratifying the desires it inspires?",
  "54970": "Where in the world have you been, my lad?",
  "54971": "For do you not see the wide and unknown wilderness behind?",
  "54972": "Yes, who was she?",
  "54973": "And do you cool yourself in that stream now, my young friend?",
  "54974": "Why, especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not care about me?",
  "54975": "What better way was there to take care of his life in the helpless growing time than by passing him into obscurity?",
  "54976": "Are you going anywhere in particular just now?",
  "54977": "What are you but a boy?",
  "54978": "See you nothing walking on the shore of the pond?",
  "54979": "Which one?",
  "54980": "Is it ill done?",
  "54981": "You're sure you had it on when you left the ball?",
  "54982": "What more do you know about him?",
  "54983": "But may I give it to you?",
  "54984": "Male or female, sir?",
  "54985": "But do you see they don't think we are married?",
  "54986": "What is the latest news about your father?",
  "54987": "Are you educated, young sir?",
  "54988": "She hasn't got it, doctor, has she?",
  "54989": "You promise it?",
  "54990": "Going?",
  "54991": "And what would you say of the physician?",
  "54992": "Or did you do so, in the service of a perishing state, by the punishment of an axe?",
  "54993": "On account of your approaching marriage with her?",
  "54994": "Something that crossed me?",
  "54995": "You could not have made any slip in coming?",
  "54996": "What arrangement do you want to come to?",
  "54997": "Copperfield?",
  "54998": "WHAT'S that?",
  "54999": "What has monsieur to say for him?",
  "55000": "You are going, sir?",
  "55001": "Sire, you have forgiven me, then?",
  "55002": "Was there even a single reason to be so?",
  "55003": "Knows she of this?",
  "55004": "I've a good mind to turn them out of the house this moment?",
  "55005": "Has she come with designs upon me?",
  "55006": "What is art beside love?",
  "55007": "What are your orders about the pictures?",
  "55008": "How shall I not do after thy bidding?",
  "55009": "Still, if I may venture a suggestion, in what way are these two people endeavouring to entrap us?",
  "55010": "If it was out of the way and no one wanted it, no one could mind my having it, could they?",
  "55011": "Then you all came back again, ma'am?",
  "55012": "And if I am myself, you mean?",
  "55013": "How should he be helped?",
  "55014": "Who else can have such processions and vestments and music?",
  "55015": "Who knows, but she may have found the joy she sought?",
  "55016": "You think so?",
  "55017": "You are certain of this amount?",
  "55018": "Yes, but the horses?",
  "55019": "Or how remove the encumbrance?",
  "55020": "If so, shall I take you anywhere?",
  "55021": "Or will you be contented with the first now, and stay for the other till after grace?",
  "55022": "What's a peculiar man to a nation?",
  "55023": "What is it?",
  "55024": "Are you happy here?",
  "55025": "You were only in fun?",
  "55026": "And washing?",
  "55027": "There still remained an arrest to be effected, but what were these commonplace rogues that he should soil his hands with them?",
  "55028": "How dare you appeal to me just now, you false rascal, as if we had been in discussion together?",
  "55029": "Where would his miserable wife, the accursed, lovely sinner, find him, when she sought him again?",
  "55030": "It starts your mind working, now don't it?",
  "55031": "Why is it that scarcely any are executed but the poor?",
  "55032": "Can you realize that death, which you have yet no immediate experience of, is the greatest of evil?",
  "55033": "Did you force it away from her, or did you steal it?",
  "55034": "Well, there it is, you see what you are pitting yourselves against?",
  "55035": "Of wood?",
  "55036": "Angry?",
  "55037": "What do you mean by thinking about it?",
  "55038": "What, who are you?",
  "55039": "You think his allowance is plenty, don't you?",
  "55040": "What did you lie to me for, then?",
  "55041": "Is it true?",
  "55042": "Are you trying to get to church?",
  "55043": "You would agree with me?",
  "55044": "The deuce on you, what more might a king, an emperor, or a pope wish for?",
  "55045": "Once when?",
  "55046": "But why should you see him?",
  "55047": "Is it sheer love of their species, and an unadulterated wish to see young people happy and dancing?",
  "55048": "Is it possible that you do not know of whom you purchased it?",
  "55049": "Have I interrupted a conversation?",
  "55050": "And then of what use would be pursuit?",
  "55051": "Oo'm I to wait on yer?",
  "55052": "Well, and is not this one quality, to mention no others, greatly at variance with present notions of him?",
  "55053": "Do you know him?",
  "55054": "Why cannot we ever know all about another, especially when that other has been guilty?",
  "55055": "And he would not have found the same resources on the side we are making for?",
  "55056": "But who should speak first?",
  "55057": "Whether you did not also pledge yourself to astonish the government, and make them shrink in their shoes?",
  "55058": "Or have you forgotten them?",
  "55059": "Upon my word, madam, what are you saying?",
  "55060": "Who shall presume to imitate the colors of the tulip, or to improve the proportions of the lily of the valley?",
  "55061": "Is he wild?",
  "55062": "Are you presuming to question me?",
  "55063": "Tea or chocolate?",
  "55064": "Where's the box with the new clothing and necessaries for them?",
  "55065": "Why not donkeys?",
  "55066": "Who goes here?",
  "55067": "What could my darling do, I asked, left destitute and penniless?",
  "55068": "But what right had you?",
  "55069": "Signs and wonders, eh?",
  "55070": "Were they all fastened this morning?",
  "55071": "Your people don't usually travel in character, do they?",
  "55072": "Do you sincerely wish me to be your wife?",
  "55073": "What do you still apprehend?",
  "55074": "Well, and did papa do what he wanted for him?",
  "55075": "Father's form?",
  "55076": "And what do you think they found in the pockets?",
  "55077": "But, let me ask ye, sir, have you been as intelligible to the girl?",
  "55078": "And are the lions large?",
  "55079": "Have you ever sat before?",
  "55080": "What are you here for?",
  "55081": "What are we to do, sir?",
  "55082": "You are sure of this, are you?",
  "55083": "I wonder whether she will ask me to be a bridesmaid?",
  "55084": "Is she well?",
  "55085": "And tribute paiment gone along with him?",
  "55086": "Did you expect any other?",
  "55087": "Can you not wait now and mention it to him?",
  "55088": "In the next place our youth must be temperate?",
  "55089": "And the ciphers?",
  "55090": "Father alive?",
  "55091": "But am I a teacher because I teach, or a parson because I preach?",
  "55092": "She'll ask you, presently, if she is to owe her excuse to your interposition?",
  "55093": "Did he give you any details?",
  "55094": "Have you seen him, mother?",
  "55095": "Are they going to be so mean as to call my uncle out of bed, to show him what I've been doing?",
  "55096": "But what do I know?",
  "55097": "But will your uncle be angry if we have the breakfast up there?",
  "55098": "And then what?",
  "55099": "How can a man explain at the expense of a woman?",
  "55100": "Is the water clear?",
  "55101": "Why, then, this restlessness?",
  "55102": "And in the case of mammals, were they created bearing the false marks of nourishment from the mother's womb?",

  "55112": "D'ye hear the creature?",
  "55113": "How do you come back here again?",
  "55114": "What is the boasted intellect of man?",
  "55115": "What else is there?",
  "55116": "Where would you like to sit?",
  "55117": "Who'll give me a hand up?",
  "55118": "What right has anyone to get drunk like this?",
  "55119": "But she don't care anything for 'n?",
  "55120": "And you have not seen it ?",
  "55121": "Is she mad?",
  "55122": "Who would neglect such a profitable investment?",
  "55123": "Wife and child?",
  "55124": "Aren't you making fun of me about that three quid?",
  "55125": "What dreadful mystery were they about to penetrate?",
  "55126": "My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much?",
  "55127": "Well do you mind having it instead of the crabs?",
  "55128": "But don't you think l deserve a little consideration for concealing my wrong, very wrong, sentiments, since I couldn't help having them?",
  "55129": "Do you know what my opinion is?",
  "55130": "They keep a place going, don't they?",
  "55131": "Will you be carving out at that church again next week, where you learnt the pretty hymn?",
  "55132": "Where alive is that gal?",

  "55759": "How many all told?",
  "55760": "What letters?",
  "55761": "Will it not be better that she should keep the resentment of the insult for ever?",
  "55762": "What could be the cause of this phenomenon?",
  "55763": "Or whether it eats and drinks?",
  "55764": "But what would you say in it?",

  "57522": "Having got it, why do you give me the pain of looking at you for another moment, and seeing what you have become?",
  "57523": "And so you will not tell me?",
  "57524": "And does he not do so with reason?",
  "57525": "Have you seen them?",
  "57526": "But what was there to laugh at in it?",
  "57527": "What was meant by the invective against him who had no music in his soul?",

  "57534": "Why can't somebody send us supports?",
  "57535": "What do you think of all this?",
  "57536": "What still remaineth to me?",
  "57537": "Why not stay on quietly here, like us, and be jolly?",
  "57538": "Can one tell what goes on in such undeveloped brains?",
  "57539": "What do you mean by this noise, you hussies?",
  "57540": "And the devil teaches you to swear at daddy?",
  "57541": "Where is it now, then?",
  "57542": "What can he be to me when he shall have married the daughter of such a man as that?",

  "57552": "What was the removal of this wretched creature?",
  "57553": "You'll stay to tea, won't you?",
  "57554": "And that because my presence in the world would lead to the revelation of a great secret?",
  "57555": "Would it be quite regular, dear?",
  "57556": "Shall we wait breakfast for you?",
  "57557": "What if she doesn't see herself what she's doing?",
  "57558": "It is indigestion, no doubt?",
  "57559": "Can you guess, captain?",
  "57560": "But what can you hope to do?",

  "57579": "What do you know about him?",
  "57580": "Do you know the sound of gold?",
  "57581": "Then perhaps you can tell me why my grandmother has brought me here?",
  "57582": "Where is my visitor, where my dear monk?",
  "57583": "Standing or lying?",
  "57584": "Tell me how long it takes to prepare the earthquake?",
  "57585": "What does she try to do?",
  "57586": "Has he borrowed any money from you, prince?",
  "57587": "Can it be bad news?",
  "57588": "What have I done to her?",
  "57589": "What should my feelings be, do you suppose?",
  "57590": "Then, if your heart does, why not your hand?",
  "57591": "She's so horrible?",
  "57592": "What took it out?",
  "57593": "Besides, why shouldn't he take bribes?",
  "57594": "Can't you leap back again?",
  "57595": "Might it not be that his acquittal or conviction would depend on what she might now learn from him?",
  "57596": "Is she old?",
  "57597": "What was it to me whom my uncle might choose to conceal in his house, where I was myself a guest only by tolerance?",
  "57598": "Is it under all of them?",
  "57599": "Thirty million dollars' worth o' mistake, wasn't it?",
  "57600": "Is man, in the hour of triumphant ambition, so moderate, that we can be willing that he should attain power which places us at his mercy?",
  "57601": "And will he get this appointment?",
  "57602": "But where was the last place he was in?",
  "57603": "But now you are happy?",
  "57604": "If I had the least doubt of your love I would not make it, but you love me, my beautiful mistress, do you not?",
  "57605": "Would you have him turn his children's mother out of doors?",
  "57606": "You know that curious cellular matter which constitutes the elementary tissues of vegetable?",
  "57607": "Perhaps you recollect me?",

  "57613": "Something about yourself?",
  "57614": "Any what?",
  "57615": "And who made it?",
  "57616": "You could no longer bear the idea of this ruffian owning her?",
  "57617": "Had that writer any echo of the names in his head?",
  "57618": "How now, signior?",
  "57619": "Won't you be there?",
  "57620": "Oh, ay, I'm a good feller, am I?",

  "57652": "Had he not everything which girls do love?",
  "57653": "So you want me to speak to him?",
  "57654": "And when will you call?",
  "57655": "An important island?",
  "57656": "Ought I to go to him to bring a disgrace upon all the family, just because he is so good that he asks me?",
  "57657": "Seriously, I'm not annoying you, am I?",
  "57658": "She oughtn't to be thinking about spending her money on theatres already, do you think?",
  "57659": "What is this cross they are both learning to kiss, and holding up between them?",
  "57660": "And why a coxcomb?",
  "57661": "Is it not the latter's mirror, reflection, echo, an abyss which is concentric with another abyss?",

  "57683": "If you have, how can you keep away from me?",
  "57684": "You will remember what I said?",
  "57685": "But the boat?",
  "57686": "You were not certain my child was dead, and you buried it?",
  "57687": "What does it matter to you?",
  "57688": "What is the amount of truth that springs from your laws, and what amount of justice springs from your tribunals?",
  "57689": "O wheres the author of this endles woe?",
  "57690": "But pray what did he say, when I was gone?",
  "57691": "Having found so many good people in my youth, why do I find so few in my age?",
  "57692": "It will be such a delicate compliment, don't you think?",
  "57693": "You only intend, then, to dispose of that part of your fortune which the law allows you to subtract from the inheritance of your son?",

  "57730": "Lay hold on me, sir, for what?",
  "57731": "Was there any use?",
  "57732": "To get married?",
  "57733": "On what ground, we ask, is the proprietor entitled to this rent?",
  "57734": "Where does it lead to?",
  "57735": "And do you take the oldest or the youngest, or only those of ripe age?",
  "57736": "Won't you go now?",
  "57737": "But I want to know where from?",
  "57738": "You are not dreaming of it, are you?",
  "57739": "Who's somebody?",
  "57740": "That is your opinion, is it not?",
  "57741": "Then what do you suggest that we do?",
  "57742": "Could any amount of immorality have placed him in a much worse one?",

  "57766": "Now I am sure you can eat another breakfast?",
  "57767": "And my silliness is part of my charm?",
  "57768": "But we'll begin again, won't we?",
  "57769": "But how are you going to decide this for a nation?",
  "57770": "Archer?",
  "57771": "THAT wretched creature?",
  "57772": "Should I, who never do ill to any person, be the innocent means of doing it to my friends?",
  "57773": "What has he been doing all this time?",
  "57774": "Shall I, the queen, be able, then, to bear off no prize?",
  "57775": "Did you hear 'em shooting the cannon?",
  "57776": "Is it less than just that you should suffer as you have caused others to suffer?",
  "57777": "And what said the abbe?",

  "57800": "And the boy is dying, you say?",
  "57801": "Don't you understand how I want you for my wife?",
  "57802": "And the chariot?",
  "57803": "How long ago was it?",
  "57804": "Why do you wander so much in it yourself if you so dislike it?",
  "57805": "What in the world for?",
  "57806": "What sort of instances do you mean?",
  "57807": "Why tarry we?",

  "57816": "Sixteen leagues?",
  "57817": "Are the lads asleep?",
  "57818": "Why, child?",
  "57819": "And can all this be true, think you?",
  "57820": "Would not one say he was speaking of a religious community?",
  "57821": "Were they permitted to indulge these cannibal propensities at the expense, not of the flocks, but of the shepherds of the provinces?",

  "59503": "And opinion is to have an opinion?",
  "59504": "Which of the six chose you?",
  "59505": "What does this signify?",
  "59506": "Would she not be more comfortable, as I suggested, at the hotel?",
  "59507": "You had a good journey?",
  "59508": "We'll stay, won't we?",
  "59509": "You don't mean to say you have sold it?",
  "59510": "For?",
  "59511": "Oh, grandpapa, did you not say the colt sold for five pounds more than you expected?",
  "59512": "And what if he won't let you have them?",
  "59513": "I don't think of it?",
  "59514": "Did you not charge him with unbridled insolence?",
  "59515": "Where are we going?",
  "59516": "Why can't we walk?",
  "59517": "Do you suppose the dryad will come out after we go away and take it for a scarf?",
  "59518": "And where are they?",
  "59519": "What will you do in a foreign land, an enemy's country?",
  "59520": "Why stay ye from the window far, nor gaze with all the town?",
  "59521": "Maisie, darling, doesn't it make any difference?",
  "59522": "If ye were included, why not others?",
  "59523": "Where'd YOU come from?",
  "59524": "His leg, forsooth?",
  "59525": "But would you allow me the favour of a minute's private conversation?",
  "59526": "And did he give you this letter?",
  "59527": "What inconvenience can it be?",
  "59528": "What do you expect, then?",
  "59529": "Whom do you suspect?",
  "59530": "And you laugh at the king, then?",
  "59531": "Ah?",
  "59532": "But what is a dog to know in its consciousness of madness?",
  "59533": "Will you try a bit of the beef?",
  "59534": "First of all, what is the name of this river?",
  "59535": "And you preached her sermons there, did you?",
  "59536": "Do you give lessons, ma'am?",
  "59537": "How are you going?",
  "59538": "Shall we preserve and transmit it to posterity?",
  "59539": "Then are we to impose all our enactments on men and none of them on women?",
  "59540": "And now what are we to do?",
  "59541": "You want to know how we came here?",
  "59542": "What then are we to understand by the objection which this paper has combated?",
  "59543": "What could he do to move this crowd and definitely to win over public opinion?",
  "59544": "Can we send the child back to the asylum?",
  "59545": "And what plainer than that he treats him then as a beast of burden?",
  "59546": "The patch or the campaign?",
  "59547": "To act?",
  "59548": "Did you, indeed?",
  "59549": "I'll go to 'em tonight and sing a wedding song, hey?",
  "59550": "In the table?",
  "59551": "Did you hear, goodman?",
  "59552": "So he won't have it?",
  "59553": "And you'll stick to it, mother?",
  "59554": "Why talk of me?",
  "59555": "But the quarter's notice?",
  "59556": "But why I had no notice of his ire?",
  "59557": "Or is one soul in the very least degree more or less, or more or less completely, a soul than another?",
  "59558": "Will the marquis honor me by a few moments' private conversation?",
  "59559": "What were they?",
  "59560": "I suppose he's in no immediate danger?",
  "59561": "Who shall regulate all the mixed conversation of our youth, male and female together, as is the fashion of this country?",
  "59562": "Had he, on the other hand, smoked too much?",
  "59563": "What castellan that received him in his castle ever made him pay his shot?",
  "59564": "But the lock?",
  "59565": "Shall I kiss your hand upon the contract?",
  "59566": "Don't you think that's better than subletting?",
  "59567": "May I ask the name?",
  "59568": "What?",
  "59569": "Strangers?",
  "59570": "Or were they there from some ulterior motive?",
  "59571": "Does it?",
  "59572": "But you'll come back to dinner?",
  "59573": "Shall I open a flask?",
  "59574": "Why bother about human relationships?",
  "59575": "And will he bring me back a bear?",
  "59576": "What would that language have been?",
  "59577": "What more can I do?",
  "59578": "Have you cried your grief away?",
  "59579": "Have you picked many of your apples yet?",
  "59580": "What was going to happen to her henceforth?",
  "59581": "I can't out of the bottle, can I?",
  "59582": "Shall my father be informed of your wish?",
  "59583": "To hide, in the nature of how many women?",
  "59584": "You believed in my good fortune in the old days, do you now doubt this true story?",
  "59585": "You've not met since that night?",
  "59586": "Will you try?",
  "59587": "What course do you intend to take?",
  "59588": "Now, how shall we settle this?",
  "59589": "What is it to you?",
  "59590": "Do you think that I was then dead to agony and remorse?",
  "59591": "Any news?",
  "59592": "Is there no end to it?",
  "59593": "But a ricordo of what?",
  "59594": "How many times have we had danger from this question?",
  "59595": "Which is the part in man, which, as he grows fatter, never gains flesh?",
  "59596": "And don't he know me?",
  "59597": "And next, how does he live?",
  "59598": "Am not I here, whom you have made your creature?",
  "59599": "Do you want to hire any men?",
  "59600": "News?",
  "59601": "You are a scholar too, I dare say?",
  "59602": "Did you come here to fetch me?",
  "59603": "In praising his generosity, who can mingle any censure for such manifest prudence?",
  "59604": "Don't you know nothing?",
  "59605": "Have you come to see me or my mother?",
  "59606": "Nelly gave it to him?",
  "59607": "What the devil do I see yonder?",
  "59608": "And your previous dreams, were they real too?",
  "59609": "Do you want to see me?",
  "59610": "Hucky, do you das't to go if I lead?",
  "59611": "Did you get here quickly?",
  "59612": "What was their reply?",
  "59613": "Does one know?",
  "59614": "What's the beadig of this?",
  "59615": "Not one word of comfort?",
  "59616": "May I ask of what breed he is sprung?",
  "59617": "What sort of grim adventure was it on which I had embarked?",
  "59618": "Would you have done it?",
  "59619": "Will you not give up this plan?",
  "59620": "Don't you know who WE are, either?",
  "59621": "D'ye think there's any money hanging by it?",
  "59622": "But could you not be mended?",
  "59623": "Does that seem like too much work?",
  "59624": "Who are these creatures?",
  "59625": "Isn't the sight of him maimed like that enough to melt the heart of a stone?",
  "59626": "What witnesses would support my statements?",
  "59627": "You remember what are the properties of two similar triangles?",
  "59628": "WELL, and how does success taste?",
  "59629": "How in thunder d'ye work that out?",
  "59630": "She would be ashamed of her mother, you mean, and of her mother's brother too, eh?",
  "59631": "Mates, do you hear that?",
  "59632": "Of what do you complain?",
  "59633": "Or come sad tidings from our native land?",
  "59634": "You know what it is to be in love?",
  "59635": "In the smuggling line?",
  "59636": "Do you wish to say anything further to him?",
  "59637": "Hussey?",
  "59638": "Had it not been pity so good a man should have been cast away?",
  "59639": "Why do we prize changing organism more than inorganic matter, unchanging and constant?",
  "59640": "But is this a defence?",
  "59641": "You perceive then the utter impossibility of escaping through your dungeon?",
  "59642": "You like this weather?",
  "59643": "Then, does he write?",
  "59644": "What of it, then?",
  "59645": "Well, are they at home, my good man?",
  "59646": "WAS IT A PARTISAN PROSECUTION?",
  "59647": "When houses are owned by loyal citizens, but are unoccupied?",
  "59648": "Are we really quite lost, your excellency?",
  "59649": "Look here, dear prince, BE so kind, will you?",
  "59650": "Is it not well that such men should be brought low?",
  "59651": "And what is the new one like?",
  "59652": "Do you not see how the old man who drives a cart looks anxiously about?",
  "59653": "What will you eat?",
  "59654": "Is my peace nothing?",
  "59655": "Isn't it acting, my dear, to accept it?",
  "59656": "But what was his share in it that he can't be forgiven for?",
  "59657": "What business is 't of yours?",
  "59658": "Can't we get a special?",
  "59659": "You are right, clearness is what you wish, is it not?",
  "59660": "And you say this young man behaved himself well?",
  "59661": "Are we not to put on our diver's dresses?",
  "59662": "If we couldn't be perfectly frank and dear with each other, it would be ever so much better, wouldn't it?",
  "59663": "But for what purpose is it your idea that they should again so intimately meet?",
  "59664": "Let you steer?",
  "59665": "But, tell me, what do you ask?",
  "59666": "How about opening our letters?",
  "59667": "But what is the cause of this increasing humidity?",
  "59668": "Are you in contentment now?",
  "59669": "And from what?",
  "59670": "How much will that be?",
  "59671": "And in all these cases, the recollection may be derived from things either like or unlike?",
  "59672": "What are you staring at?",
  "59673": "Home?",
  "59674": "How much do I owe you?",
  "59675": "Of my old friends?",
  "59676": "The devil's agents may be of flesh and blood, may they not?",
  "59677": "Did she tell you of this?",
  "59678": "Do I date it?",
  "59679": "Or shall we say, that it is of any service in the conduct of life, and an assistant to prudence?",
  "59680": "What shall I try this time?",
  "59681": "Call you this dying?",
  "59682": "And why weep for this?",
  "59683": "How is it you are on foot?",
  "59684": "So you're a messenger of victory, eh?",
  "59685": "Can you tell me whence I derive this inference?",
  "59686": "Had he eyebrows like that?",
  "59687": "What is there I care for?",
  "59688": "Was it still night?",
  "59689": "Don't you want to read it?",
  "59690": "Why came I here to cast away my life?",
  "59691": "The old gentleman over the way?",
  "59692": "Did you say, four ladies?",
  "59693": "Do you still wish to dispose of all?",
  "59694": "Does he tell lies?",
  "59695": "I wonder what it can be?",
  "59696": "Why should this place lie idle?",
  "59697": "Do you see this little door and little house?",
  "59698": "Do these correspond to the phases of apprehension?",
  "59699": "Don't you think you can smell the smoke here?",
  "59700": "Am I not a member of the consulting commission?",
  "59701": "What's your pay?",
  "59702": "Who told you so?",
  "59703": "For whom were the soldiers below at the carriage waiting?",
  "59704": "Now won't you give me the tortoise?",
  "59705": "Must the citizen ever for a moment, or in the least degree, resign his conscience to the legislator?",
  "59706": "Do you want to cross the channel?",
  "59707": "If you saw me looking out of an upper window, you'd think I was a fine woman, wouldn't you?",
  "59708": "But can this be so confidently said of sexual selection?",
  "59709": "And is there any hope of that, sir?",
  "59710": "Where are you going?",
  "59711": "You will appear at this ball?",
  "59712": "What did I come for?",
  "59713": "Whose?",
  "59714": "This is where he lives, is it?",
  "59715": "But what does all this mean?",
  "59716": "And have you a pale blue dress on?",
  "59717": "And in the course of that month?",
  "59718": "Who can live the same moment twice?",
  "59719": "What did he say in that one?",
  "59720": "Is it true that you received there a man who is your lover?",
  "59721": "Is any man, in these days, sensible, seeing what a racket we have to live among?",
  "59722": "Quis custodiet istos custodes?",
  "59723": "Let's sit here for a bit, shall we?",
  "59724": "How many days would it require to make two studs exactly like them?",
  "59725": "Then is not this test reliable?",
  "59726": "What could it be, once more?",
  "59727": "Have you neglected to obtain information on that point?",
  "59728": "When do the servants go to bed?",
  "59729": "Why take I not my pleasure when I may, seeing that I never need lack for occasions of trouble and vexation of spirit?",
  "59730": "He passes along the same path at the same hour, and to whom should he be going except to the convict?",
  "59731": "Wasn't it a noble chase?",
  "59732": "And the murderer?",
  "59733": "How might it come to pass that we should all die there, through anybody's hate?",
  "59734": "What did he do there?",
  "59735": "But can't I give you a new book?",
  "59736": "Are you not?",
  "59737": "And the queens?",
  "59738": "Where go ye now?",
  "59739": "What are they doing?",
  "59740": "Len, you will make it all right?",
  "59741": "The car?",
  "59742": "Was he, or was he not, the father of the young girl?",
  "59743": "He only peeps?",
  "59744": "When will you come to see me?",
  "59745": "What would you wish for, girls, if you could have a wish granted?",
  "59746": "What can I be?",
  "59747": "Why, what were you going to do?",
  "59748": "How then could you have recognized me, if you have never seen my portrait or my person?",
  "59749": "Whose name?",
  "59750": "What does she carry?",
  "59751": "What has he got, this time?",
  "59752": "Why, what?",
  "59753": "Why had everybody been in such a frantic hurry in this matter?",
  "59754": "He'd better nip his little passion in the bud, hadn't he?",
  "59755": "How old are they?",
  "59756": "How would a boy like that?",
  "59757": "O was she so?",
  "59758": "To place yourself under his protection?",
  "59759": "Ay, do you make a wonder on't?",
  "59760": "Why should I object?",
  "59761": "What but a future of patient labor?",
  "59762": "How is your father getting on?",
  "59763": "These walls are you going, gentlemen?",
  "59764": "Where is such a judge to be found?",
  "59765": "Why, then, is he not indemnified?",
  "59766": "Why did they do it?",
  "59767": "These were the exact words, my beloved husband, were they not?",
  "59768": "Is it for my own pleasure that I am at the farm or in the office from morning to night?",
  "59769": "He is not resident, then?",
  "59770": "Is the swallow in sight?",
  "59771": "What kind of fish?",
  "59772": "Where had she seen those lineaments before?",
  "59773": "Why must he?",
  "59774": "What has she written to me?",
  "59775": "Have you ever been on it?",
  "59776": "What do you mean?",
  "59777": "Are you sure she is safe?",
  "59778": "Can he be inconstant before being happy?",
  "59779": "Ah, your honor, how can you say so?",
  "59780": "If it be only a struggle for a new balance of power, who will guarantee, who can guarantee, the stable equilibrium of the new arrangement?",
  "59781": "You'll write to me while you're in, won't you?",
  "59782": "Why should it not be known?",
  "59783": "What was the good of talking, any way?",
  "59784": "Because the higher he flies, the fewer?",
  "59785": "Think better of what?",
  "59786": "Mayn't I sing them just one LITTLE song?",
  "59787": "Should they end by both getting lost, and by furnishing two skeletons in a nook of that night?",
  "59788": "What is your name, my friend?",
  "59789": "Or could it be that within lay the secret to the treasure stores?",
  "59790": "Are you satisfied, gentlemen?",
  "59791": "The name of your ship?",
  "59792": "Wish to consult me on the matter?",
  "59793": "And can we tell, how long he may choose to respect those conditions?",
  "59794": "Do you press me to tell?",
  "59795": "How can I support this?",
  "59796": "How shall we live through the long winter here?",
  "59797": "You have actually seen the members of the legislature?",
  "59798": "And if he wakes up presently, where shall we be?",
  "59799": "And the best hack?",
  "59800": "Why do you not turn round and speak to me properly?",
  "59801": "What's in the bottle, boy?",
  "59802": "Of what was he thinking during this profound depression?",
  "59803": "How is it that it opposed no resistance to the motion of comets which have almost grazed the sun's surface?",
  "59804": "Who is that woman?",
  "59805": "Well then, do it, will you?",
  "59806": "Stolen from you?",
  "59807": "The fat woman who goes about in a green blouse?",
  "59808": "Who should quail while they do not?",
  "59809": "How many acres?",
  "59810": "Wherein especially does the poetry of our times differ from that of the last century?",
  "59811": "To stuff every hole with some kind of oakum?",
  "59812": "Do you not believe, then, that we women deserve to be loved?",
  "59813": "But what was the state of the conquerors?",
  "59814": "May I have the honor?",
  "59815": "Where is the gentle one?",
  "59816": "What is there now to warrant the condition of affairs presented by our friends over the river?",
  "59817": "Once more, how do you know?",
  "59818": "This must be a strange night to you, standing alone here with your counterpart on these street stones?",
  "59819": "You and YOURSELF, you're of some importance, aren't you?",
  "59820": "You don't hear much about them now?",
  "59821": "Who is this master of your lives?",
  "59822": "But what are you talking about?",
  "59823": "You wanted it to be there, didn't you?",
  "59824": "Hold your tongue, will you?",
  "59825": "Who cares for me?",
  "59826": "When passed?",
  "59827": "How is it going?",
  "59828": "If, however, your wish should be one impossible to fulfill?",
  "59829": "What tower is fallen, what star is set, what chief come these bewailing?",
  "59830": "Why do you not leave me alone?",
  "59831": "Where are they to come from?",
  "59832": "Louisa saw her when she came?",
  "59833": "Why did you look at the sunset?",
  "59834": "Why did they insist so strenuously upon this, and incorporate it into their philosophy?",
  "59835": "Shall I ring for candles, sir?",
  "59836": "Oh, why should I be made to worry?",
  "59837": "Have you found your tramp?",
  "59838": "With whom?",
  "59839": "Do you see the joke?",
  "59840": "But why this elaborate deception?",
  "59841": "Should you mind?",
  "59842": "And literature may be either true or false?",
  "59843": "Is there more, then?",
  "59844": "What if they had?",
  "59845": "HAS HE WIT?",
  "59846": "Lackeys?",
  "59847": "Why should we defer our joys?",
  "59848": "How is the poor little wounded girl?",
  "59849": "Can we do anything for you?",
  "59850": "I think I could?",
  "59851": "Was this a joke, then?",
  "59852": "Why does she come prowling here?",
  "59853": "No mental inconvenience, I hope?",
  "59854": "There has been fighting, then?",
  "59855": "What irritated this mollusc?",
  "59856": "Or man, indeed?",
  "59857": "Where do you come from?",
  "59858": "You won't take it uncivil of me if I say that my visit is not entirely to yourself?",
  "59859": "Have you planned to come and live with us?",
  "59860": "I hope you suffer no inconvenience from the overturn, ma'am?",
  "59861": "Is not wounded vanity the mother of all tragedies?",
  "59862": "But why should it have been otherwise?",
  "59863": "Ask her, does she do this for amusement, or does she expect to earn money by it?",
  "59864": "Would that volatile mind, that inconstant heart, be likely to be fixed for a moment, even were it to gaze upon an angel?",
  "59865": "Lily, will you say that it shall be so?",
  "59866": "Pray you what do you mean, sir?",
  "59867": "Tomorrow, then?",
  "59868": "Into what whirlpool had she been dragged?",
  "59869": "Will nothing convince you?",
  "59870": "Do they fish for them in these days?",
  "59871": "And why of them to be ?",
  "59872": "And the horse?",
  "59873": "To what end was I born with exquisite faculties?",
  "59874": "Why yes, am I not devoted body and soul to your majesty?",
  "59875": "Why, what of them?",
  "59876": "Oh, but are you going to her?",
  "59877": "How is your uncle pleased with him?",
  "59878": "How the devil could it be otherwise in her frightful isolation?",
  "59879": "Do you think that the tree really did cure toothache, if one believed in it?",
  "59880": "Then will you consider about it, neighbour?",
  "59881": "Hurt?",
  "59882": "Swerve me?",
  "59883": "And what kind was she?",
  "59884": "Monsieur, and in what respect not?",
  "59885": "Have you wanted money, father?",
  "59886": "Is not your city in my power?",
  "59887": "What is this ideal?",
  "59888": "Is an indefinite power to raise money dangerous in the hands of the federal government?",
  "59889": "What more can you demand?",
  "59890": "Taken forfeit of their mortgage?",
  "59891": "Don't you think it does?",
  "59892": "A boat?",
  "59893": "It is not so, brother?",
  "59894": "Any why not this evening?",
  "59895": "Has he been to sea?",
  "59896": "Why, don't you remember what passed on the subject one night, when I was laid up with a broken limb?",
  "59897": "The little people, the poor, the unhappy, well, what of them?",
  "59898": "And now, guess what your good children were doing?",
  "59899": "Why should they care if they were known?",
  "59900": "Man to beast?",
  "59901": "But what's the use of talking?",

  "60303": "You will wait for me, then?",
  "60304": "Was it through the chimney?",
  "60305": "But what can I do, sister?",
  "60306": "Well, are you coming?",
  "60307": "It was from your wife, we supposed?",
  "60308": "And had I wasted some of the best years of my life to obtain a shadow?",
  "60309": "It is, then, the cardinal's custom to walk in his orangery?",
  "60310": "Oh how great a confidence shall there be to the dying man whom no affection to anything detaineth in the world?",
  "60311": "He paid for them, did he not?",
  "60312": "And if the world perceives that what we are saying about him is the truth, will they be angry with philosophy?",
  "60313": "Can such men fall away from reality?",
  "60314": "Are those our barks, yonder?",
  "60315": "How dare you come here?",
  "60316": "What is a magician?",
  "60317": "Wots the consequence?",
  "60318": "And would ye hear this likewise?",
  "60319": "How can one be in doubt about what one has heard with one's own ears and seen with one's own eyes?",
  "60320": "By some happy device?",
  "60321": "Is the wind favourable?",
  "60322": "Why did you let me do such a silly thing?",
  "60323": "Have you an invite too, doctor?",
  "60324": "Why did he wish it?",
  "60325": "And suppose she does not mind her p's and q's?",
  "60326": "What makes you say that?",
  "60327": "Excuse him?",
  "60328": "Wasn't I faithful?",
  "60329": "Can you get me the grammars if I promise to say it hereabout?",
  "60330": "Would he startle him with sudden fear?",
  "60331": "How would you like to come in on that with me?",
  "60332": "But are you flesh and blood?",
  "60333": "She's not in this house, for instance?",
  "60334": "Hoo be all wi' ye?",
  "60335": "What time do you get up to get breakfast?",
  "60336": "Well, and what do you mean to do with me?",
  "60337": "Why don't you get into touch?",
  "60338": "And you went asking money of him, or making talk of getting a wife would drive him from his farm?",
  "60339": "You include the grounds about the houses?",
  "60340": "What, then, remains?",
  "60341": "But are we not made better for the effort and sacrifice, and are not those we serve lifted up and blessed?",
  "60342": "Would she have still loved this savage warrior chieftain, dancing naked among his naked savage subjects?",
  "60343": "What ship sail home to her haven?",
  "60344": "Can't you hear?",
  "60345": "If a law is wrong how are we to make its immorality evident?",
  "60346": "You hear the charge?",
  "60347": "But what do I see?",
  "60348": "Jane, you understand what I want of you?",
  "60349": "How did feudalism end?",
  "60350": "How about the license?",
  "60351": "Price?",
  "60352": "If not, where was the man, and why did he not come back?",
  "60353": "What think you sir?",
  "60354": "For what purpose are we come here?",
  "60355": "Good faith?",
  "60356": "Oh, don't you see how much nicer it would be if it was a secret?",
  "60357": "Confess what?",
  "60358": "Is this a time to be offering pardons, or renewing the long forgotten subjects of charters and taxation?",
  "60359": "Would you care to come and dine with me?",
  "60360": "What could she have done to you?",
  "60361": "And shall we begin at once?",
  "60362": "But would you be able for it, my boy?",
  "60363": "Surprised at this emphasis, I surveyed my valet, and, perceiving a wildness in his looks, asked if he had seen his grandfather's ghost?",
  "60364": "Get it ready, will you?",
  "60365": "But you could find out?",
  "60366": "Was she pretty?",
  "60367": "Or will he say that to abolish corruption is a bad thing?",
  "60368": "And why did the body conceal itself?",
  "60369": "Jo, how could you?",
  "60370": "Don't they say as there's somebody can strip it off him?",
  "60371": "Is not all here yours?",
  "60372": "What other possible reason could there have been for her so blushing ?",
  "60373": "What made him seek this quarter of the house at an untimely season, when he should have been asleep in bed?",
  "60374": "Where can they have crossed?",
  "60375": "If such things are done in the green wood, what will be done in the dry?",
  "60376": "And whom he brought back this morning?",
  "60377": "Any references?",
  "60378": "Was not he believed to be dead?",
  "60379": "With whom are you going to fight?",
  "60380": "Then don't you despair?",
  "60381": "And why think you that will make him sad?",
  "60382": "But when will you come and see my study?",
  "60383": "My friends, why with us?",
  "60384": "What a carriage that was, and where did it come from, eh?",
  "60385": "But is that all your evidence?",
  "60386": "Why did you give him six pistoles?",
  "60387": "You deny it?",
  "60388": "Do you feel that you are a sufficiently practical man?",
  "60389": "How do you mean sad?",
  "60390": "What crime, then, have you committed?",
  "60391": "Did I tell you?",
  "60392": "Fwhat are you talkin' of?",
  "60393": "How could she, indeed?",
  "60394": "Don't you hear often?",
  "60395": "But, surely, there is some one in the world whom you love?",
  "60396": "And where is his corpse?",
  "60397": "Well, do you know what is taking place at this moment?",
  "60398": "And would you like to be here alone with her for a month?",
  "60399": "Isn't it a peacock?",
  "60400": "For instance, if you lived in the penal days?",
  "60401": "I say, what on earth's the matter?",
  "60402": "She has gone to visit friends?",
  "60403": "But why did men who were interpolating bronze corslets freely introduce bronze so seldom, if at all, as the material of greaves?",
  "60404": "And the men?",
  "60405": "Do you s'pose they would?",
  "60406": "Are you making fun of me?",
  "60407": "How could he possibly have doubted it?",
  "60408": "Who ever got a letter that was worth waiting for?",
  "60409": "What is your theory, then?",
  "60410": "You've come at last, have you?",
  "60411": "How may I tell you for what we were sunk here, when I do not know, unless it was because we were rich?",
  "60412": "But what good can one do oneself?",
  "60413": "And you're so great a favourite there, you say?",
  "60414": "Give up?",
  "60415": "Are you sure you wouldn't like some more breakfast?",
  "60416": "When shall I have you here again?",
  "60417": "If she's charming, how can she help it?",
  "60418": "And discarding all consideration of political consequences, what unspeakable personal glory there would then be to him as a man?",
  "60419": "You'll not tell, will you?",
  "60420": "How could she ever suppose such a thing?",
  "60421": "Was it the same desperate confusion, or would the ground offer better facilities?",
  "60422": "Why, but will you leave him with so slight command, and infuse no more charge upon the fellow?",
  "60423": "Sherry or 'ock, sir?",
  "60424": "You have the unspeakable effrontery to stand there and admit it?",
  "60425": "True?",
  "60426": "Very distant?",
  "60427": "Does his conscience ever entertain the question of his right to such subsidies?",
  "60428": "How shall I defile them?",
  "60429": "Can you strike a man to the heart and leave no mark on him?",
  "60430": "Do you know whence comes our real power?",
  "60431": "You don't suppose she could take any interest in you, do you?",
  "60432": "What's your hurry?",
  "60433": "If it be, how can that question have place, concerning the subsistence of self, under a change of substance?",
  "60434": "That?",
  "60435": "And in what light must I appear to the world?",
  "60436": "Marilla, have I really a pretty nose?",
  "60437": "On the other hand, what do we see?",
  "60438": "But what should we have been then?",
  "60439": "For are not milliners and mantuamakers reckoned the next class?",
  "60440": "She used to speak of me then?",
  "60441": "Could I ever forget?",
  "60442": "You think not, sir?",
  "60443": "Ran away with her?",
  "60444": "But do you?",
  "60445": "What sort of weather was it?",
  "60446": "And all for what?",
  "60447": "So that was the way they did it, eh?",
  "60448": "What admission?",
  "60449": "To make the people laugh?",
  "60450": "How can we get it?",
  "60451": "When shall we be governed?",
  "60452": "To enter in the wall?",
  "60453": "Is it important business?",
  "60454": "How dare you, sir, break it?",
  "60455": "You can think of, and remember her?",
  "60456": "Would you not sooner stay with me than with them?",
  "60457": "To whom, then?",
  "60458": "Do you fear that they might be stolen?",
  "60459": "Does she know it?",
  "60460": "What do you think of me?",
  "60461": "Who is it, and what's wanted?",
  "60462": "How it happened?",
  "60463": "What is it gives her the power to look down on everything, to be calm independently of everything?",
  "60464": "Tom, what is the matter?",
  "60465": "If upon the ocean, would any passing vessel be within hail to rescue them from their critical position?",
  "60466": "What is the use of your exertion, they would say, in accumulating wealth, which is doomed to melt away in the twinkling of an eye?",
  "60467": "But if you yourselves should be struck?",
  "60468": "Don't you see how his back is laden?",
  "60469": "Where shall the little boy ride to?",
  "60470": "And you owned up?",
  "60471": "Why did you, if you regret it?",
  "60472": "Now you know me, don't you?",
  "60473": "May I see if they have more scent than the others?",
  "60474": "To do what?",
  "60475": "Oh say, what sums that generous hand supply?",
  "60476": "You did at last?",
  "60477": "Hadn't we better go?",
  "60478": "But what must be done?",
  "60479": "Is there no wizardry within it?",
  "60480": "Davy?",
  "60481": "What position do you hold?",
  "60482": "Do you mean I'm to clean pots and pans and things?",
  "60483": "Why don't you go away with him?",
  "60484": "Is it empty?",
  "60485": "But how to get to him in safety?",
  "60486": "After all, thirty cents isn't much, eh what?",
  "60487": "Wouldn't you punish children at all, when they misbehaved?",
  "60488": "And why did he fire at us?",
  "60489": "Has he built one here, then?",
  "60490": "Will that satisfy you?",
  "60491": "Soft, who be these?",
  "60492": "What upon earth is to make them so?",
  "60493": "James's?",
  "60494": "Is your father in?",
  "60495": "Why were you treated so?",
  "60496": "And is that all, papa?",
  "60497": "Isn't that a nice imaginative name?",
  "60498": "The poorest?",
  "60499": "What's up now?",
  "60500": "You'll come out after supper, won't you?",
  "60501": "Don't you know the temptation to say frightful and shocking things just for the mere sake of saying them?",
  "60502": "You are going on a journey?",
  "60503": "You think it right, then, that your niece should throw herself in his way?",
  "60504": "Stronger then he was wont?",
  "60505": "And if you keep it under your skirts like that, who's to help tumbling?",
  "60506": "And the worthy man destroyed your compromising letter?",
  "60507": "Mary what, doctor?",
  "60508": "How can you say that, sir?",
  "60509": "Nay, why external for internal given?",
  "60510": "What would it profit a woman, for example, to get him a few months' imprisonment if her own ruin must immediately follow?",
  "60511": "What kind of people?",
  "60512": "And why did she weep so bitterly?",
  "60513": "Is this modesty?",
  "60514": "Whatever was it I was disputing about?",
  "60515": "Well now, what are you going to do about it?",
  "60516": "Indeed, who is free from them?",
  "60517": "Is this the way to the princesses' apartments?",
  "60518": "What have you been doing that you shouldn't?",
  "60519": "But why this singular vision, if the portrait is a faithful copy of the original?",
  "60520": "Tell me, if you please, what seems to cause you so much joy?",
  "60521": "But would you mind letting me hold your hand?",
  "60522": "Would he be in a position to marry?",
  "60523": "What about, sir?",
  "60524": "Then why go there?",
  "60525": "Has a crime been committed?",
  "60526": "Where should she turn for advice and counsel?",
  "60527": "Doctor, would it be proper to ask what is your secret?",
  "60528": "Do you like him any better?",
  "60529": "Was the lady crying?",
  "60530": "What's on your mind?",
  "60531": "Where are you going to?",
  "60532": "Will you make yourself known to me?",
  "60533": "There is one strange thing, do you know it?",
  "60534": "And you've not been anywhere this evening?",
  "60535": "What had she done to have deserved all this?",
  "60536": "But what about the fighting?",
  "60537": "You haven't any heart, have you?",
  "60538": "Is the fellow gone that brought this letter?",
  "60539": "What she?",
  "60540": "Tart of palate?",
  "60541": "And what made him drink?",
  "60542": "And what do you suppose it is?",
  "60543": "Why did you not come and speak to me in the room?",
  "60544": "Anthony, was it you?",
  "60545": "What I want to know is, where did he get that cheque?",
  "60546": "After dodging me for all these weeks and forcing me to climb the roof here like a tom cat and to come to see you as a doctor?",
  "60547": "Wasn't I telling you, and you a fine, handsome young fellow with a noble brow?",
  "60548": "Then to injure a friend or any one else is not the act of a just man, but of the opposite, who is the unjust?",
  "60549": "Who would say that, having come so far together, we will not go forward from here?",
  "60550": "What do you want with us?",
  "60551": "For has he not fine fences?",
  "60552": "Are they pretending?",
  "60553": "Why have I alluded to this man?",
  "60554": "Does your explanation cover every point?",
  "60555": "Have you managed it?",
  "60556": "But whither?",
  "60557": "Ain't what's a man's wife's his?",
  "60558": "The verses accompanying this, may I beg you to take out of the tomb, and bring them to light in the 'Home journal?",
  "60559": "By whose authority?",
  "60560": "What will you say, then?",
  "60561": "Doen't I want you more now, than ever I did?",
  "60562": "What signifies my refusing?",
  "60563": "How could I have forgotten that?",
  "60564": "But what shall we do with the poor gentleman?",
  "60565": "And you intend to make him do it in the presence of two witnesses, do you?",
  "60566": "Will your majesty allow me one word of reply?",
  "60567": "You knew the pig?",
  "60568": "At whose hand?",
  "60569": "Why do you think that you are safer in this room than on the stage?",
  "60570": "Do you think it points to suicide?",
  "60571": "Know?",
  "60572": "Do you not know him, queen?",
  "60573": "How much?",
  "60574": "I wonder what that old man meant by his strange words?",
  "60575": "Did you see that woman who went by just now?",
  "60576": "It's not a matter of principle, but why should I go?",
  "60577": "How could I escape through these mighty walls?",
  "60578": "Are you in earnest or no?",
  "60579": "Would he ever live until then, with his strength ebbing away?",
  "60580": "Haf you got a new light for my cigar?",
  "60581": "Do you think that you could perform one more feat?",
  "60582": "What have been the results of your quarrel?",
  "60583": "How could it be?",
  "60584": "Then the superhuman and divine is absolutely incapable of falsehood?",
  "60585": "Are there no such things as pewter forks and spoons?",
  "60586": "Well, you know it's burned, so what's the use of talking?",
  "60587": "Don't I tell you he's provincial of the order now?",
  "60588": "Club?",
  "60589": "Does not this stream at our feet run toward the summer, until its waters grow salt, and the current flows upward?",
  "60590": "Is that my case?",
  "60591": "And you allowed it?",
  "60592": "For his own sake?",
  "60593": "And what are those studies, if I may presume to ask?",
  "60594": "What sort of things do YOU remember best?",
  "60595": "What does that mean?",
  "60596": "And of what did he die?",
  "60597": "Why am I always to be worried?",
  "60598": "You've seen a lot of trouble, sir, eh?",
  "60599": "How did you know it?",
  "60600": "Is that it?",
  "60601": "When shall we see each other?",
  "60602": "Why, have you got something the matter with you?",
  "60603": "Your son?",
  "60604": "What terrible step might she not take to effect her wishes?",
  "60605": "You're quite sure it's all right for you?",
  "60606": "And ought she to regard me as a friend?",
  "60607": "Where must I look?",
  "60608": "HOW'D you come?",
  "60609": "How could he get the school shopkeepers into trouble by owning that they let some of the boys go on tick with them?",
  "60610": "But how could I?",
  "60611": "What are your commands, lieutenant?",
  "60612": "Do you think he games at all?",
  "60613": "Why should I have dreaded it?",
  "60614": "After having once received the human organism, why should a soul choose to go back to the lesser and more imperfect organism of an animal?",
  "60615": "You will not go, then?",
  "60616": "Each day?",
  "60617": "Why don't you rent a furnished room and leave them in that for a week?",
  "60618": "But what is there to oblige him to reply?",
  "60619": "What have you two been doing now?",
  "60620": "Why is it you have earth that's not sifted?",
  "60621": "Why had he suggested a dinner party?",
  "60622": "But is he near at hand?",
  "60623": "Is there a man or a voman in this valley vat does not know it?",
  "60624": "What fortune?",
  "60625": "D'ye think 'twill hurt me?",
  "60626": "My soule?",
  "60627": "What could they take from me?",
  "60628": "Didn't you see anything in the corner, on the left, on the third shelf?",
  "60629": "Do you feel the earth tremble?",
  "60630": "Yet indeed, what was I to him?",
  "60631": "Have you no idea of the existence of spirits superior to either man or beast?",
  "60632": "Orpheus ?",
  "60633": "Have you lost anyone, my dear fellow?",
  "60634": "Must I go afoot?",
  "60635": "Why, is it late?",
  "60636": "And what will they burn instead of coal?",
  "60637": "What do they boil with 'em?",
  "60638": "Shall we, then, regard a hearty appetite as a curse, to be mitigated but not wholly neutralized by a series of good dinners?",
  "60639": "Know ye of it in this land?",
  "60640": "Nay, I beseech you, gentlemen, what means this?",
  "60641": "What makes my presence here so opportune?",
  "60642": "Had he bribed the agent?",
  "60643": "Do you think that I am in earnest?",
  "60644": "A marchioness?",
  "60645": "At home?",
  "60646": "Where do you wish him to be?",
  "60647": "And that is your room up there?",
  "60648": "Where did he get his grasp upon affairs and his knowledge of men?",
  "60649": "Not violets?",
  "60650": "And how did you find him?",
  "60651": "Of the breaking up of the frozen sea in their displeasure?",
  "60652": "What are they, then, doctor?",
  "60653": "What business have you with luxuries of that kind?",
  "60654": "Isn't it a sickening FOOL ?",
  "60655": "I suppose you'll say there is nothing national about our literature either?",
  "60656": "Did he not excel in all the exercises and accomplishments proper to youth?",
  "60657": "What then will it be when it forms a judgment about anything aided by reason and deliberately?",
  "60658": "Who, my life?",
  "60659": "What would your aunt have said to it?",
  "60660": "Could he be certain that some conjuncture would not occur which would bring the mysterious personage on the scene?",
  "60661": "Surely that is all simple and obvious?",
  "60662": "What is it that drove you, impelled you, to separate yourself from the great natural path of marriage and the family?",
  "60663": "Could you tell me them, so that I can suit them to my purpose?",
  "60664": "You have nothing else to report to us before we go into this matter?",
  "60665": "So you're my nephew, are you?",
  "60666": "Has my horse had an extra feed?",
  "60667": "What, says I, have the galls been jiltin you?",
  "60668": "But why insult the poor, affront the great?",
  "60669": "WHY?",
  "60670": "Where you can be relieved?",
  "60671": "You know that they live securely and have nothing to apprehend from their servants?",
  "60672": "How dare you question me?",
  "60673": "Whence come you, sir?",
  "60674": "Damon, what is the matter with you, that you speak like that?",
  "60675": "May I help myself again?",
  "60676": "Why did he ride away before I had time to ask him how his lord and lady do I?",
  "60677": "And do not good practices lead to virtue, and evil practices to vice?",
  "60678": "What, haven't you seen her lately?",
  "60679": "How can you say I am harsh, you naughty fondling?",
  "60680": "And you would really wish me to marry this girl?",
  "60681": "What were you doing at the moment you were arrested?",
  "60682": "Oh, what made you?",
  "60683": "Had they found the life of the body after all?",
  "60684": "Have all these, your friends, been there?",
  "60685": "How do you all do?",
  "60686": "Had he abandoned the effort, or was he continuing his journey along the route agreed upon?",
  "60687": "Aren't you thinking of giving me any?",
  "60688": "Couldn't you try to reastralize them?",
  "60689": "I never made a fool of you, did I?",
  "60690": "If he were an assassin, would I save him?",
  "60691": "Whence, and what art you?",
  "60692": "What is the matter with you this morning?",
  "60693": "Why not end it all?",

  "60847": "Don't I pay her a dozen pound a year to do things for 'ee?",
  "60848": "How could it occur to her to examine the letter, to look at it critically as a profession of love?",
  "60849": "Since you had already given the matter publicity, why did you object just now, when I began to speak of it to my friends?",
  "60850": "So that old scoundrel's dead, is he?",
  "60851": "I suppose she doesn't think that I'm to have all the sweat and that she is to have all the profit?",

  "61297": "Oh, indeed?",
  "61298": "Besides, which am I to choose?",
  "61299": "Go to?",

  "61315": "What instructing do you think I should do?",
  "61316": "What took her away?",
  "61317": "Yes, how long?",

  "61333": "What did she send?",
  "61334": "Should he find him at all?",
  "61335": "Why should I meddle?",
  "61336": "The earlier it might be, would it not be better?",
  "61337": "The theories say that, do they?",
  "61338": "And what hope was there that these designs would fail?",
  "61339": "Not from the photos I have showed you?",
  "61340": "Have you ever noticed that the ones we would love the most distractedly are those whom we never meet to know?",
  "61341": "Well, then, my lord, say, are you satisfied?",
  "61342": "Gentlemen, do you stare?",
  "61343": "Well, what do you want?",
  "61344": "Why, monsieur, what secret can you expect to find in the hollow head of a soldier?",
  "61345": "Are you going to return there?",
  "61346": "What need has it of exaggeration?",
  "61347": "What if she loves you now better than anyone?",
  "61348": "Do you happen to know any one in this neighbourhood who would receive him for a while on my paying for him beforehand?",
  "61349": "He has done his best, but what does a fish's best come to when the fish is out of water?",
  "61350": "You are a reactionary, then?",
  "61351": "What's up, anyhow?",

  "61366": "I say, did you mean it the other day that you wouldn't marry me if I asked you?",
  "61367": "Is anyone up in your house?",
  "61368": "Will that suit you?",
  "61369": "Have I not explained your wishes, grandpapa?",
  "61370": "Did you see it?",
  "61371": "And, to be frank, my lord, was I wrong?",
  "61372": "From what?",
  "61373": "How was he to meet his lawyer?",
  "61374": "Herod?",
  "61375": "Cautious, why so?",
  "61376": "Was it the better to deceive them both?",
  "61377": "Why can't I?",
  "61378": "Did you tell us?",
  "61379": "Do you understand what you have done to me?",
  "61380": "Nor church?",
  "61381": "Does it end with just our two selves?",
  "61382": "Will there be beds for me and all who seek?",
  "61383": "But it's SOMEBODY'S plates, ain't it?",

  "61471": "Yes?",
  "61472": "You think there may be fighting?",
  "61473": "Could it be that by some neglect in the preparations, the substitution perhaps of the wrong brandy, the astralization could not be effected?",

  "61510": "How would they address us?",
  "61511": "Is there any thing new in this doctrine?",
  "61512": "What was she to say to him?",
  "61513": "You doubt it then?",
  "61514": "What sort of mischief?",
  "61515": "What sense is there in murdering a man in order to define one's relation to a guilty wife and son?",
  "61516": "Then this new kind of knowledge must have an additional quality?",
  "61517": "Lads, haven't you a sack?",
  "61518": "How do you mean, bold?",
  "61519": "They taught you that?",
  "61520": "But you, critic, the reader undoubtedly will ask, what is your solution?",
  "61521": "But the heat developed by the rapidity of the projectile in crossing the strata of air?",
  "61522": "Well, are you trying to make out that I've said you have?",

  "61524": "What is it, a man?",
  "61525": "Whom do you think that is to?",
  "61526": "The lighted window, right up there?",
  "61527": "An' you don't seem to have done any great things for yourself by going away?",
  "61528": "But if I lose?",
  "61529": "There, who are you?",
  "61530": "Or, perhaps, you may have the precious object she wants in your collection?",
  "61531": "Who do you think should be sent there?",
  "61532": "And what for?",
  "61533": "But, my dear fellow, in that case, why didn't you get him a pauper's funeral?",
  "61534": "Should he place his catastrophe as a third associate in their felicity?",
  "61535": "Can you speak, lady?",
  "61536": "He has extensive house property in the city and three places of business and isn't it to his own advantage to keep down the rates?",
  "61537": "Do what?",
  "61538": "That so?",
  "61539": "And you followed the business of a tailor?",
  "61540": "But how did you gain them?",
  "61541": "Whither should they go, and where should be the new seat of the mission?",

  "61550": "Should she speak to her?",
  "61551": "Should she open the door or should she not?",
  "61552": "Now, while you have tyranny in so great a degree walled in, and see your enemies over your heads, to what purpose is it to take counsel?",
  "61553": "But don't you know the higher you climb, the colder it gets?",
  "61554": "You do not know that you love me?",
  "61555": "What in thunder has that to do with you?",
  "61556": "No one at home?",

  "61578": "How can we ever thank you?",
  "61579": "Is it probable?",
  "61580": "Kitchens?",
  "61581": "And then should not the charity be all the more profound, in proportion as the fall is great?",
  "61582": "How was he to get through his present difficulty?",
  "61583": "What have you to say?",
  "61584": "You know?",
  "61585": "Is there any place at liberty that you know of now, uncle, that I should do for?",
  "61586": "But, why should I conceal my sentiments?",
  "61587": "But won't you join me at supper, now 'tis waiting and all?",
  "61588": "Whom do you mean by THEY?",
  "61589": "Their graces?",
  "61590": "Shall I call him?",
  "61591": "How and why could it be mistaken?",
  "61592": "What the devil do you mean by this?",

  "61594": "Are you sure you don't hurt your hand, doing that?",
  "61595": "Well, mon cher, have you got the manifesto?",
  "61596": "How, you are going soon?",
  "61597": "So saying, he fixed his eyes upon me, and asked if I had seen him tremble?",
  "61598": "Isn't she enormous?",
  "61599": "But the man who was under him?",
  "61600": "Did he still cherish hope?",
  "61601": "Isn't it a dreadful feeling?",
  "61602": "Why funny?",
  "61603": "What have I done?",
  "61604": "Do you know much of him?",
  "61605": "Are you quite ready, gentlemen?",
  "61606": "To get what's left me sold by auction?",
  "61607": "What is to be done in these circumstances?",
  "61608": "Could he be sure that he was not their accomplice?",
  "61609": "Did the people shout at all?",
  "61610": "Excuse me,' and you believe that is sufficient?",
  "61611": "You aren't taking hoboes, are you?",
  "61612": "I daresay you've heard of her?",
  "61613": "Perhaps you'd care to come in and have a drink on your way?",
  "61614": "Must I receive it, or leave it in the hands of the notary?",
  "61615": "What is the meaning of that?",
  "61616": "Oh, you know him?",
  "61617": "Sir, have you finished supper?",
  "61618": "What did I get by that?",
  "61619": "What has become of the faith which has hitherto carried you so bravely through all our difficulties?",

  "61624": "How should I know?",
  "61625": "What had been his object?",
  "61626": "And would that be all?",
  "61627": "Do you remember that after less than a year of married life you stood on the verge of an abyss?",
  "61628": "Aren't they really terrifying?",
  "61629": "Don't you see, now, what's the matter with that ha'nted room?",
  "61630": "Why should I die, then, or basely despair?",
  "61631": "And anyone else?",
  "61632": "And what did he tell 'ee next?",
  "61633": "Do you never feel sick of it?",
  "61634": "Was this precaution or humility?",
  "61635": "Any men on it?",
  "61636": "Was it possible they heard not?",
  "61637": "Why do men halt between two opinions, and expect impossibilities?",
  "61638": "What are you wanting?",
  "61639": "Why aren't you in bed?",
  "61640": "Will not the good people respond to a united and earnest appeal from us?",
  "61641": "Who could be suspected of this mischief?",
  "61642": "But why should I not receive her?",
  "61643": "But from whom is that letter?",
  "61644": "Have you them?",
  "61645": "What, gentlemen, is your verdict?",
  "61646": "What's a tall man unless he fight?",
  "61647": "Did that person not come back, then?",
  "61648": "Was there any other spirit but rum in the room?",

  "61651": "Do you want me to tear out my hair in handfuls?",
  "61652": "If the officer be accused of dishonesty, how shall it be made out?",
  "61653": "Where is the cure?",
  "61654": "Are you on the ground?",
  "61655": "You mentioned a fowl, I think?",
  "61656": "Upon what?",
  "61657": "Is not this an extraordinary tale?",
  "61658": "What are you meddling with my deeds for?",
  "61659": "Who is it, then, that you want to see?",
  "61660": "Is it to be yes at last?",
  "61661": "What made you think she would be here?",
  "61662": "WHO is in the room?",
  "61663": "What was there to be seen there?",
  "61664": "Was there left now nothing but to break off from the happy creative being, was the time up?",
  "61665": "You are not going out, uncle?",
  "61666": "What does it matter where it comes from?",
  "61667": "You are determined, then, to push your fortune in other lands?",
  "61668": "Ain't he played me tricks enough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time?",
  "61669": "Why should I be ashamed of myself?",
  "61670": "And there are four of you?",
  "61671": "How will it do, how will it do?",
  "61672": "Did you see the libraries and schools!?",
  "61673": "I should like to know whether you have the same notion which I have of this study?",
  "61674": "Who is going to dress me?",
  "61675": "Think of who?",
  "61676": "What is it you want to distract you?",
  "61677": "Whose beneficence was like his?",
  "61678": "Who taught her?",
  "61679": "It was not he, then, you came to seek?",
  "61680": "Who'll have her?",
  "61681": "Did you speak to him?",
  "61682": "Have you seen fifty frightful men pass down from the cliffs into this forest, my children?",
  "61683": "Will your ladyship stay the night?",
  "61684": "What can he be picking up?",
  "61685": "Then why on earth does she do it?",
  "61686": "How could this be, sir?",
  "61687": "Shall I tell you why?",
  "61688": "What is the day of the month?",
  "61689": "What shall become of me?",
  "61690": "Hasn't she come back yet?",
  "61691": "Well, have you made up your mind to this journey?",
  "61692": "And him you found?",
  "61693": "Did he get his brain fever, and then write all those terrible things, or had he some cause for it all?",
  "61694": "Was she young?",
  "61695": "Cosette?",
  "61696": "Have you seen?",
  "61697": "Where shall we go?",
  "61698": "Or what is this?",
  "61699": "Have you, indeed, my boy?",
  "61700": "Have you seen the general?",
  "61701": "What have you been doing during my absence?",
  "61702": "To you, eh?",
  "61703": "But can the musician by his art make men unmusical?",
  "61704": "Well, and your guardian must be brave if he is to fight well?",
  "61705": "Has my girl any objection?",
  "61706": "Now, when the restriction is removed, what is to prevent it from going still farther?",
  "61707": "But, I say, do you make any progress in it?",
  "61708": "But who should less expect from you?",
  "61709": "Then how d'you know that we have the truth now?",
  "61710": "I would have you consider seriously of it?",
  "61711": "And what money 'ud he want?",
  "61712": "What would you have, sir?",
  "61713": "Were they asleep?",
  "61714": "Yet if he is not the maker, what is he in relation to the bed?",
  "61715": "Of complexion and brown hair?",
  "61716": "Have they contributed to encourage the diligence, and to improve the abilities, of the teachers?",
  "61717": "What about marriage?",
  "61718": "My friend, whom, then, will you serve?",
  "61719": "Did I forbid myself to think of him in any other light than as a paymaster?",
  "61720": "How is it that justice and isolation always accompany each other?",
  "61721": "And how is it to be parried?",
  "61722": "The rabbit?",
  "61723": "What could he have wanted there?",
  "61724": "Rob?",
  "61725": "So there is a hole?",

  "61728": "The first question is, whether music is or is not to make a part of education?",
  "61729": "Will you do me the favor to explain this enigma to me?",
  "61730": "Is there any other point which you would like to ask about?",
  "61731": "The bed might have been let down by some artificial means?",
  "61732": "But what are you up to?",
  "61733": "But what about you, and the rowing?",
  "61734": "Oh, why wasn't somebody kind to her?",
  "61735": "May I have a grill for dinner?",
  "61736": "What need he add to such a desperate proof in figures?",
  "61737": "Did you promise to marry her?",
  "61738": "Did you speculate any more?",
  "61739": "Haven't you your power of attorney?",
  "61740": "What, let me ask, is a man in and of himself?",
  "61741": "Why so much beating about the bush?",
  "61742": "Or am I not to know?",
  "61743": "What does your chamber open on?",
  "61744": "Come to where four roads meet?",
  "61745": "What's this round your neck?",
  "61746": "And which?",
  "61747": "Why do you want to do that at this particular time, when at every previous time that I have proposed it you have refused?",
  "61748": "What gallows?",
  "61749": "Do you think you can help me, dear grandpapa?",
  "61750": "Why do you sit out here all alone?",
  "61751": "O why was that so?",
  "61752": "You know what they say of my lodger?",
  "61753": "I wonder who 'tis?",
  "61754": "But if he gives you?",
  "61755": "What money is this?",
  "61756": "And would it be indiscreet to ask you the name of this powerful protector?",
  "61757": "I beg your pardon?",
  "61758": "What do you call liberty, monsieur?",
  "61759": "You'll mention that I called, perhaps?",
  "61760": "You notice my ring?",
  "61761": "What revenge?",
  "61762": "Won't you have an egg beaten up in a glass of milk while you're waiting?",
  "61763": "What say ye?",
  "61764": "Against your father?",
  "61765": "Is it all right in the new way?",
  "61766": "Are those horrid creatures gone?",
  "61767": "Why does he then exceed all bounds at once?",
  "61768": "How are you sure?",
  "61769": "Does any one live, who knows what set purposes you have, half as well as I do?",
  "61770": "Could it be that these were four words, and that they were intended to carry a message to me?",
  "61771": "There is nothing you desire?",
  "61772": "Will you let me make the tea?",
  "61773": "What else did he say to you?",
  "61774": "What is there in all that for me to think about?",
  "61775": "By pulling out a bar and pushing down a door?",
  "61776": "Aye?",
  "61777": "Well, miss?",
  "61778": "But what was to be done?",
  "61779": "Was the projectile under some foreign influence?",
  "61780": "Will you begin, if you please, and put in the thatch again, just as if you were doing it for your mother's cabin?",
  "61781": "Shall we not set forth?",
  "61782": "Do you, sir?",
  "61783": "Do you think this does?",
  "61784": "Do you think you could hustle something in the way of a little lunch, old man?",
  "61785": "What could this NN be?",
  "61786": "And how did he behave, madam?",
  "61787": "How much do you require for my ransom?",
  "61788": "Wouldn't you like him to dribble into the great flood?",
  "61789": "But are your relatives so very poor?",
  "61790": "What is all this dancing up and down?",
  "61791": "If all were only vanity, who would mind it?",
  "61792": "Would I not give my life to secure it?",

  "61794": "But how did you proceed?",
  "61795": "What was it placed there for?",
  "61796": "Are YOU there?",
  "61797": "Or perhaps it is the pale morning light which takes your colour away?",
  "61798": "Why did you not bring it at once?",
  "61799": "The messenger that brought it, said would you be so good as read it by my lantern?",
  "61800": "If anyone arrives in my absence, do the honors for me, will you not?",
  "61801": "Has the breakfast been all right?",
  "61802": "Of what day?",
  "61803": "Has anyone?",
  "61804": "I trust you are in good health, and that your families are all well?",
  "61805": "Don't you see them, in that box far back?",
  "61806": "Was it the fall of some mighty pillar of the globe?",
  "61807": "Well, what now?",
  "61808": "Think?",
  "61809": "And the youth repented, and became a good man?",
  "61810": "He rends defenseless women and little children in his lair, but how recently has one of you seen him fight with men?",
  "61811": "Pray, what may that portmanteau of yours weigh?",
  "61812": "You'll be sure to be stirring early and go with us?",
  "61813": "Will it be possible to draw water here tonight?",
  "61814": "Are any of the gallants within?",
  "61815": "Well, then, what do you make of your word AUSTRA?",
  "61816": "Where does the fun come in?",

  "61822": "Will he succeed in his purpose?",
  "61823": "Oh, how could you act so?",
  "61824": "And yet, he said, the number two is certainly not opposed to the number three?",
  "61825": "No lands neither?",
  "61826": "What were horses made for, if not to drag people uphill?",
  "61827": "In which of your characters, sir, will you give us leave to address you?",
  "61828": "Why have you thrown that away?",
  "61829": "Dead?",
  "61830": "Will you never correct yourself of that vile habit?",
  "61831": "And what did you think, sir, of what I said?",
  "61832": "What, then, it may be asked, is the good of being great?",
  "61833": "I wonder which craft I shall get?",
  "61834": "You promise?",
  "61835": "Not so much as out of bed?",
  "61836": "What's the good of tormenting him like this?",
  "61837": "What do you think of that?",
  "61838": "Can you not do anything you wish?",
  "61839": "But how were you to benefit?",
  "61840": "Rinaldo, why still so pensive?",
  "61841": "What can I do for you?",
  "61842": "What have I done to need his forgiveness?",
  "61843": "And whom I so dearly love?",
  "61844": "Only compatible with letting ME, you mean?",
  "61845": "If so, is he mad?",
  "61846": "Do we eulogize the man who first perceives the dawn?",
  "61847": "Is she one of the performers?",
  "61848": "What rights does your majesty attach to this office of intendant?",
  "61849": "Money, I presume?",

  "61851": "Pray to what is this attributable?",
  "61852": "How can it be otherwise with me?",
  "61853": "Peace?",
  "61854": "What work are you about now?",
  "61855": "Would not his hearers add to that sum?",
  "61856": "But passion for him?",
  "61857": "Who is he?",
  "61858": "Does your feminine tyranny require that when you say the thing you mean is one of several things, I should know it immediately by that mark?",
  "61859": "In what condition of mind were you?",
  "61860": "Aren't they pretty?",
  "61861": "Is it like that, dad?",

  "62305": "Won't we, friends?",
  "62306": "Do I realize solemnly enough how utterly and irretrievably this little womanly thing is the creature of my good or bad faith and fortune?",
  "62307": "Armed to the teeth?",
  "62308": "How from that arm of terror shall I fly?",
  "62309": "You bought them for yourself?",
  "62310": "Do you know anything of the sea?",
  "62311": "Have you heard?",
  "62312": "As his wife?",
  "62313": "Oh, you think it's a foolish thing, do you?",
  "62314": "Flip?",
  "62315": "And what did you do when you arrived at this conclusion?",
  "62316": "What do you expect us to do with a glass door, tubercle?",
  "62317": "How can a soulless thing be a spirit?",
  "62318": "But what need I know or care about this fellow, and his common niece?",
  "62319": "What's the meaning of that?",
  "62320": "Did you lock the front door?",
  "62321": "Do you understand that?",
  "62322": "What have you done?",
  "62323": "What does the angel of light or the angel of darkness say to that mind, at once implacable and generous?",
  "62324": "You have something particular, then, between you?",
  "62325": "Who is this devil of a man?",
  "62326": "What was I to do in the future to consolidate my authority?",
  "62327": "Did you ever hear of anything so dreadful?",
  "62328": "Who can fitly describe to you the great riches these women carry on their persons?",
  "62329": "Yes, but what is his energy directed to?",
  "62330": "Was she a servant forever?",
  "62331": "What hour is this?",
  "62332": "Do you see this firman?",
  "62333": "What do you mean by all the rest?",
  "62334": "What, then, is the significance of what is called the postal reform?",
  "62335": "I suppose you think me a 'little fool,' as they all call me at home?",
  "62336": "And is't not possible to find it out?",
  "62337": "Where, then, is this love of the celestial father for his creatures?",
  "62338": "By whom posted?",
  "62339": "Can you tell me the time, ma'am?",
  "62340": "You perceive, then, that he is not happy?",
  "62341": "Is it not a waste of time?",
  "62342": "Whither shall we go now?",
  "62343": "What does she say?",
  "62344": "Is he frightened at something, then?",
  "62345": "What is this rent?",
  "62346": "Then you've taken a good constitutional?",
  "62347": "He pays well, I hope?",
  "62348": "Why did he not apply for a passport as every one else does?",
  "62349": "Axel, have you got it?",
  "62350": "What's home?",
  "62351": "What could I gain by betraying you to those who have ruined my nation and my house?",
  "62352": "What's going to happen now?",
  "62353": "I suppose you want young ones?",
  "62354": "Back again at the old homestead, what?",
  "62355": "What name did you say?",
  "62356": "Why do you conduct yourself in this fashion toward me?",
  "62357": "You do not fear that the illness will return?",
  "62358": "Who can so minister to the inherent, perhaps barbaric remnant, love for display?",
  "62359": "Must it go in?",
  "62360": "Have I welcomed a traitor?",
  "62361": "Will you change your mind now, you blockhead?",
  "62362": "You advertised, I believe, for a salesman?",
  "62363": "Do you play on the guitar?",
  "62364": "Where should they be housed?",
  "62365": "Into the court, sir?",
  "62366": "But why need I go farther?",
  "62367": "Do you realise, father, that I've never had the least blow?",
  "62368": "But why doesn't he come?",
  "62369": "And pray has he done so?",
  "62370": "How long since utility became a principle of law?",
  "62371": "Are they nice apples?",
  "62372": "Cannot I have this one night with you?",
  "62373": "Where meantime was the hapless owner of this wreck?",
  "62374": "What do you mean, my good fellow?",
  "62375": "How far do the cases differ in principle?",
  "62376": "Is it there or not?",
  "62377": "Visiting a sweetheart?",
  "62378": "Is it wrong to watch them?",
  "62379": "Begin to break her, like a poor caged bird, and wear her deluded life away, in teaching her to sing YOUR notes?",
  "62380": "What is our name?",
  "62381": "You are doubtless provided with pistols, gentlemen?",
  "62382": "What sins have we done?",
  "62383": "He hasn't any business, has he?",
  "62384": "Why didn't ye take your holiday like the rest of the men?",
  "62385": "Help him?",
  "62386": "Then why don't you follow the cows?",
  "62387": "Is this worthy of the archic man?",
  "62388": "Could he throw no light?",
  "62389": "And what was the result?",
  "62390": "Well, how have you been?",
  "62391": "Why is not all this real?",
  "62392": "But how could he go away, leaving me in such a state?",
  "62393": "What became of her?",
  "62394": "Didn't I catch hold of his leg, neither, father?",
  "62395": "You didn't know his name, did you?",
  "62396": "Did she not always expect it?",
  "62397": "The husband?",
  "62398": "Well, why shouldn't she marry whom she liked?",
  "62399": "Why did he ever forget it?",
  "62400": "How do you know what men would fall in love with?",
  "62401": "How do you know but that it hurts a geranium's feelings just to be called a geranium and nothing else?",
  "62402": "Did the person wish to smoke?",
  "62403": "Was it a bacchanalia?",
  "62404": "And what do you decide upon now, my lady?",
  "62405": "Well and when the money's gone, what then?",
  "62406": "Do you like that better?",
  "62407": "How did you get such huge huge hands?",
  "62408": "Who were the persons in whom he placed the greatest confidence, and who took the warmest interest in his schemes?",
  "62409": "I was going to say, the will to be interested in him has died, and what else matters?",
  "62410": "Are you satisfied now?",
  "62411": "My goodness, what utter twaddle, and what may all this nonsense have signified, pray?",
  "62412": "That depends on our luck in starting, else why shouldn't we be there in time?",
  "62413": "Of what must I repent?",
  "62414": "Surely not to throw yourself into the river?",
  "62415": "But of what use is it to fatigue myself with vain words?",
  "62416": "Then we may assume that our athletes will be able to fight with two or three times their own number?",
  "62417": "The philanthropist?",
  "62418": "Why, are they after him yet?",
  "62419": "Pet name props?",
  "62420": "And she kept her word?",
  "62421": "And what was the true measurement of the new little world?",
  "62422": "Why are they the happiest?",
  "62423": "Yes, my friend, but if so, when do we lose them?",
  "62424": "Can he not hold his water at reading of a ballad?",
  "62425": "I suppose you're very glad to go?",
  "62426": "What can he want with me?",
  "62427": "What have you been doing here?",
  "62428": "And if it departed how could it move unless it went upwards?",
  "62429": "What could he do else that would have been of the smallest use to her?",
  "62430": "But is there capital punishment where you were?",
  "62431": "Do we stop here?",
  "62432": "How many are they?",
  "62433": "Is it really?",
  "62434": "So that you were at rest?",
  "62435": "A little or much?",
  "62436": "Who then?",
  "62437": "What is thy journey's mark?",
  "62438": "Are you stupid?",
  "62439": "And what's your name?",
  "62440": "Isn't he beautiful?",
  "62441": "But how could I help it?",
  "62442": "Did she die very soon?",
  "62443": "But how can you look on while your children are being taught things which you don't think are true?",
  "62444": "Do you want me to adjudicate that too?",
  "62445": "What is that to me?",
  "62446": "Perhaps you never before noticed him?",
  "62447": "Why is it, I say, that you are thus agitated in relation to the domestic affairs of other communities?",
  "62448": "How can you talk so?",
  "62449": "Who told you that they have never done so?",
  "62450": "Have you got a sledge?",
  "62451": "Haven't you some one who will relieve me of my horse?",
  "62452": "You did, didn't you?",
  "62453": "Police, sir?",
  "62454": "But come whither?",
  "62455": "Then I have received a merely legitimate salary, in spite of the opinion of my confessor?",
  "62456": "But where was the novelty?",
  "62457": "Where is your wife, in the first place?",
  "62458": "And where did the dream come from?",
  "62459": "And what shall I do if you desert me?",
  "62460": "How, nowhere?",
  "62461": "Do you know what we are eating here?",
  "62462": "Yes, but how much?",
  "62463": "Grow pale, fear, calculate?",
  "62464": "Go on the stage?",
  "62465": "Wood?",
  "62466": "What are my heart's experiences?",
  "62467": "What is the ego?",
  "62468": "Why didn't mamma and he live together, as other people do?",
  "62469": "And how much did she give you for this fine enterprise?",
  "62470": "Was there no means of calming this angry sea?",
  "62471": "What did he say to that?",
  "62472": "Do about you?",
  "62473": "What's the sense of it?",
  "62474": "Where is the guilty party here?",
  "62475": "And what happened to him afterwards?",
  "62476": "Is it a duty to postpone everything to a sense of injuries, and wrong to gratify a mother in a request like this?",
  "62477": "What will you do?",
  "62478": "Anything else, my lord?",
  "62479": "Dear mother, are you so resolved?",
  "62480": "Your husband isn't coming?",
  "62481": "But she is proud, is she not?",
  "62482": "But what does the thermometer say?",
  "62483": "Can you ask that question?",
  "62484": "What's become of them, the dear fellows?",
  "62485": "Why are you travelling?",
  "62486": "How should they use it?",
  "62487": "Does he speak to you of this conspiracy?",
  "62488": "And was SHE married?",
  "62489": "You left your door open?",
  "62490": "Is there danger of another?",
  "62491": "What had her infancy been?",
  "62492": "How much money have you left?",
  "62493": "She won't bite?",
  "62494": "What is the matter?",
  "62495": "But what were you going to say?",
  "62496": "She is no relation of his?",
  "62497": "What hard fortune brought us here?",
  "62498": "What if she were so called?",
  "62499": "In other words, should strict impartiality be aimed at?",
  "62500": "And what did he offer?",
  "62501": "Why not go and try to get speech of him and beg for justice?",
  "62502": "What shall you do in life?",
  "62503": "Was not that nearly what you said?",
  "62504": "Is not this a free country?",
  "62505": "Pears like this yer view 's quite refreshing, an't it, stranger?",
  "62506": "Which of these will be mine?",
  "62507": "How did you happen to be taken to a hospital?",
  "62508": "What is it?",
  "62509": "I brought it to the table near the fire, and asked him what he would have?",
  "62510": "Do you remember what you told me once, about her making all the apple parsties and doing all the cooking?",
  "62511": "Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind?",
  "62512": "Does this prove that ignorance and dependence domesticate them?",
  "62513": "Why do you not see this?",
  "62514": "Well, why wouldn't you?",
  "62515": "What is it makes the wolves to leave the woods?",
  "62516": "It is useless?",
  "62517": "Would you rather I didn't talk?",
  "62518": "Mad, is he?",
  "62519": "Is it a pure a priori, or is it an empirical intuition?",
  "62520": "Why does it not encourage its citizens to put out its faults, and do better than it would have them?",
  "62521": "You do work hard, don't you?",
  "62522": "Have you told them where to find me?",
  "62523": "Doesn't it depend a bit on what she regards as charming?",
  "62524": "Where, then, is the ship?",
  "62525": "I'm not very exacting, am I?",
  "62526": "And in what state of mind has he returned to you?",
  "62527": "Didn't you see the gold with your own two eyes?",
  "62528": "What was it that he did?",
  "62529": "Well, then, tell us frankly, what do you think of her personal appearance?",
  "62530": "Why, for example, should the king of a primitive community be prohibited from sleeping lying down?",
  "62531": "Where am I to join on?",
  "62532": "What right have you to bid me leave this house, sir?",
  "62533": "Who would endure this for many lives?",
  "62534": "Which is best off?",
  "62535": "Tell me, where is the place that men call hell?",
  "62536": "Then will she die too?",
  "62537": "Need it be said that no such measures could destroy that tendency?",
  "62538": "Od's precious, come away, man, what do you mean?",
  "62539": "May I go and help carry the things to the poor little children?",
  "62540": "Have heard them say that there is nothing pleasanter than to get rid of their pain?",
  "62541": "Who could see?",
  "62542": "Have you any more to stake?",
  "62543": "What shall you tell her?",
  "62544": "What like is he?",
  "62545": "Is this of envy or no?",
  "62546": "Why, WHY do they torment me and say I am going to marry you?",
  "62547": "If I went to sleep as I proposed, how could the atmosphere in the chamber be regenerated in the interim?",
  "62548": "I suppose you have searched her desk and things?",
  "62549": "I mean can't you put on your own clothes?",
  "62550": "What, after all, was this new oath?",
  "62551": "What then are we to conclude from these facts and considerations?",
  "62552": "How might it fare more gently with you in all the world?",
  "62553": "What avarice?",
  "62554": "Hurt me?",
  "62555": "Who's not playing fair?",
  "62556": "They were none of them among our friends at the lodge, then?",
  "62557": "Has it been so kept?",
  "62558": "So you are going away in the fall?",
  "62559": "In the flesh?",
  "62560": "Wouldn't you teach them to play on the piano, and paint on velvet?",
  "62561": "Where is my wife?",
  "62562": "Where is my native place?",
  "62563": "And had he married the valiant matron's daughter, as he promised?",
  "62564": "Everything's made to be played, with and broken, isn't it, young 'un?",
  "62565": "Whatcher take me for, hey?",
  "62566": "What do you mean, the rabbit?",
  "62567": "Now what do you say?",
  "62568": "And what sort of men do they graduate?",
  "62569": "He knew then?",
  "62570": "What was she insolent about?",
  "62571": "You don't hesitate to take a place at my side, do you?",
  "62572": "Daze my eyes, and isn't there?",
  "62573": "Do you not see his heart is fast breaking?",
  "62574": "Can this be possible, uncle?",
  "62575": "Why should they?",
  "62576": "Have you forgotten the day?",
  "62577": "Do you see anything there?",
  "62578": "What is the object of this assembly?",
  "62579": "Good heavens, are you ill?",
  "62580": "Well, did you dig up the watch?",
  "62581": "You will arrest him?",
  "62582": "And aren't you?",
  "62583": "What uncanny secret did it hold?",
  "62584": "Why is she thus possessed, and why does she not spare herself?",
  "62585": "But won't you speak to him?",
  "62586": "At any rate, you have some walks in the neighbourhood?",
  "62587": "You have been a soldier?",
  "62588": "But why a year?",
  "62589": "Who's that laughing at me?",
  "62590": "Where, then, would have been her navy, her trade and even her existence?",
  "62591": "What do you hear from your mother?",
  "62592": "How could I settle the point forever?",
  "62593": "What does that spell?",
  "62594": "He means to marry you?",
  "62595": "But would that be necessary?",
  "62596": "What did happen?",
  "62597": "Is the shepherd said to be just to his sheep and his dogs?",
  "62598": "Why do you keep the secrets of that man, when they mean death to so many?",
  "62599": "But if I pursue and nothing gain, what will it profit me to come up with him?",
  "62600": "Do you wish to get out?",
  "62601": "Clara, are you ready to come home?",
  "62602": "Did you ever hear of such ingratitude?",
  "62603": "The best school?",
  "62604": "Get me up, can't ye?",
  "62605": "Bread?",
  "62606": "Dare they to hope a poet for their friend?",
  "62607": "What do I deduce from this?",
  "62608": "When did that person come here, waiter?",
  "62609": "What has made you so disobedient and unfaithful?",
  "62610": "You're not in bed?",
  "62611": "What spot?",
  "62612": "Did he believe?",
  "62613": "And now, is this all you have to tell me?",
  "62614": "Could he forego the renown of being the first wit of his age?",
  "62615": "What was he hoping for?",
  "62616": "What name am I to say?",
  "62617": "Elm or fir, both of which abounded in the island?",
  "62618": "And why will they not?",
  "62619": "A new one?",
  "62620": "What if you should die first?",
  "62621": "As day by day the sun sank lower and lower in the sky, could he be certain that the luminary would ever retrace his heavenly road?",
  "62622": "Had they nothing else to say to one another?",
  "62623": "Who told you to steal?",
  "62624": "Did I not tell you how quick and resolute she was?",
  "62625": "Is there any example of an individual object that escaped the government of that law in the whole history of the world?",
  "62626": "Why tarry ye?",
  "62627": "Did he give a reason?",
  "62628": "How did you come here?",
  "62629": "Did I break through one of your rings, that you spread that damned ice on the causeway?",
  "62630": "He asked himself, or were they playing a part?",
  "62631": "Is it true that my mind is only a harmony, and my soul a vortex?",
  "62632": "But if I do fight, you will surely not object to giving me a lesson or two in shooting and fencing?",
  "62633": "Are we women?",
  "62634": "Ah, but it isn't, is it?",
  "62635": "Have you more to say?",
  "62636": "What had really happened?",
  "62637": "How if his death were occasioned by a wound received in defending his master?",
  "62638": "For what is there more prompt, more unexpected, more abbreviatory of space and time, than the maturity of an obligation?",
  "62639": "Would they be right in the future?",
  "62640": "And isn't he?",
  "62641": "And what do you say is your surmise as to your present position?",
  "62642": "Suppose now I ask, why I rather than anybody else?",
  "62643": "If what?",
  "62644": "Have you a heart?",
  "62645": "With me?",
  "62646": "Did you ever hear of such an idea?",
  "62647": "Have you quite forgotten her?",
  "62648": "Haven't they hurt his feelings?",
  "62649": "Won't you come in, brother?",
  "62650": "So you are good enough to pass my appearance?",
  "62651": "Is it tobacco?",
  "62652": "I ask you what can I do?",
  "62653": "Could it have been an early hornet?",
  "62654": "Who is that?",
  "62655": "Can you drink anything?",
  "62656": "Why not pursue an end confessedly good by peaceable and regular means?",
  "62657": "Did he come to arrest me?",
  "62658": "Whither so fast, child?",
  "62659": "Ah, why will you not unseal my lips?",
  "62660": "Does this look like confidence?",
  "62661": "Has it gone well?",
  "62662": "Admires the jay the insect's gilded wings?",
  "62663": "And did they often get a chance to do that?",
  "62664": "And do I love?",
  "62665": "UNDER THE CROSS,' hey?",
  "62666": "What did you look at, so fixedly?",
  "62667": "Why stop?",
  "62668": "And of what are you so sure?",
  "62669": "And the friend he regards and describes as one in whom he has an interest, and the other as a stranger in whom he has no interest?",
  "62670": "Can't you see what a beautiful thing it would make?",
  "62671": "For all that, are not our dresses as beautiful as yours?",
  "62672": "Why are they fighting?",
  "62673": "Is the danger you apprehended last night gone by now, sir?",
  "62674": "When the winds blow and the seas flow?",
  "62675": "Do you call this acting the part of a man and a gentleman, sir?",
  "62676": "Why should not I eat birds?",
  "62677": "Shan't we see any more of him?",
  "62678": "A slap in the face?",
  "62679": "What have you to do with our independence?",
  "62680": "Are you sure you can get 'em out of their fix?",
  "62681": "What principle directed it?",
  "62682": "Besides, why should I say anything about it to him?",
  "62683": "How did you get this passport?",
  "62684": "The house is sold, then?",
  "62685": "Well, have ye heard the news?",
  "62686": "What kind of person is she?",
  "62687": "Did he hear me?",
  "62688": "You were his constant companion, then?",
  "62689": "Is it not rather an appeal to the proprietory instinct, the COMMERCIAL instinct?",
  "62690": "Is that true, mother?",
  "62691": "How once?",
  "62692": "Wot I say?",
  "62693": "They're a nice lot, ain't they?",
  "62694": "Well, and what does it signify whether it was he or I?",
  "62695": "What formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward?",
  "62696": "Would it be believed, that when near nineteen, any one could be so stupid as to build his hopes of future subsistence on an empty phial?",
  "62697": "For what?",
  "62698": "Is not this absurd?",
  "62699": "Do you know that I am to be beheaded outside this window?",
  "62700": "Eh, who's there?",
  "62701": "How many a year, did you say?",
  "62702": "You intend to show off your intelligence, I suppose?",

  "64687": "Did she give up society?",
  "64688": "Will you not give it, sire?",
  "64689": "Will they pass us by?",
  "64690": "What more is to be done?",
  "64691": "I wish to know if, in demanding my signature, you leave me entirely free in my person?",
  "64692": "Can any one part with his life?",
  "64693": "What could it be, then?",
  "64694": "Where is the road to the east?",
  "64695": "And dare you maintain, my lord, that you at that time fulfilled the commands of your royal master simply and exactly?",
  "64696": "Can any one explain such things?",
  "64697": "And then breakfast, sir?",
  "64698": "Who is to go first?",
  "64699": "Were they normal?",
  "64700": "Do you understand, damn you?",
  "64701": "Do you carry it about with you always?",
  "64702": "What can this mean?",
  "64703": "Isn't that enough?",
  "64704": "Bare enough, now, an't it?",
  "64705": "To warn her?",
  "64706": "No, but IS he?",
  "64707": "How can I?",
  "64708": "That's it, is it?",
  "64709": "You hate mankind?",
  "64710": "But will it do you any more good to devour it with your eyes than with your teeth?",
  "64711": "Thinner?",
  "64712": "But what is the reckoning?",
  "64713": "Was he not fallen himself?",
  "64714": "But are you sure of having exhausted all other ways?",
  "64715": "But the queen?",
  "64716": "Is it not frightful?",
  "64717": "Anybody here?",
  "64718": "What will you consider the first thing to be done?",
  "64719": "May I ask to what these questions tend?",
  "64720": "Paul?",
  "64721": "And you've been idling at the schoolmaster's too, instead of coming here, ha'n't ye, hey?",
  "64722": "Is she valiant?",
  "64723": "Is this the dog goes with you?",
  "64724": "Was not the door closed?",
  "64725": "Why should one death be great, while our sacrifice is horrible?",
  "64726": "What food do you eat?",
  "64727": "I wonder if I can't get loose?",
  "64728": "Will your worship read it to me, noble sir?",
  "64729": "Where did the blood come from?",
  "64730": "Pretty smooth?",
  "64731": "You will, won't you?",
  "64732": "By doing what clever trick?",
  "64733": "Is the deed of sale ready?",
  "64734": "Are we lost?",
  "64735": "You don't remember me?",
  "64736": "A murder?",
  "64737": "Of what, then, does humanity repent?",
  "64738": "Or if honour or victory or courage, in that case the judgement of the ambitious or pugnacious would be the truest?",
  "64739": "When, where, how?",
  "64740": "What can mine own praise to mine own self bring?",
  "64741": "How could they be cordial with their sore consciences and shamed faces?",
  "64742": "Sith passed pleasures double but new woe?",
  "64743": "For you have neither relatives nor acquaintances whom you need fear to offend by living with me?",
  "64744": "How can ships sail this way and that?",
  "64745": "The stock is in your own hands?",
  "64746": "Is the danger apprehended from the other branches of the federal government?",
  "64747": "Who says it?",
  "64748": "What is going on, my lord?",
  "64749": "What can I want?",
  "64750": "How did you come up?",
  "64751": "But whence does he derive the title of count?",
  "64752": "His former love?",
  "64753": "Do you need help?",
  "64754": "Is he infirm?",
  "64755": "Jumped out of window?",
  "64756": "Why should ye ought?",
  "64757": "Why not simply issue a general order that you intend to do this?",
  "64758": "Do you like him?",
  "64759": "And the remorse of an adoring husband?",
  "64760": "Did you ever know him to cut himself in shaving before?",
  "64761": "If you are to blush to hear of such things now you are an old married woman, when are you not to blush to hear of them?",
  "64762": "What shall you do after tonight?",
  "64763": "How came you to see her?",
  "64764": "Can he endure no noise, and will venture on a wife?",
  "64765": "Why enlist?",
  "64766": "What did they talk about?",
  "64767": "But, so far as you can ascertain, he did not take it?",
  "64768": "Or should we perhaps go to him?",
  "64769": "Who is in the room besides you?",
  "64770": "What about him?",
  "64771": "Why are you standing up?",
  "64772": "Going to the raffle as well as ourselves?",
  "64773": "I wonder, is it not too late to administer unction?",
  "64774": "If we possess this force and our allies or partners do not, how do we fight together?",
  "64775": "Are the rules the same?",
  "64776": "And how many sheep?",
  "64777": "The surprise?",
  "64778": "Is my lord dead?",
  "64779": "You know her, it seems?",
  "64780": "Of WHAT?",
  "64781": "My enemy, say you?",
  "64782": "Who made them enemies?",
  "64783": "Why work on an old wound?",
  "64784": "D'ye think not?",
  "64785": "So you mean to strap them instead?",
  "64786": "What on earth does she mean?",
  "64787": "If you are suspected, you shall give the alarm?",
  "64788": "How are you going to keep the game up?",
  "64789": "Why ain't whopper as good as falsehood?",
  "64790": "Why will the seamen always become morbid when possible?",
  "64791": "You noticed she wasn't a lady, didn't you?",
  "64792": "Do you know him, ma'am?",
  "64793": "Do you want to go anywhere?",
  "64794": "Well, a great deal must have soaked through, must it not?",
  "64795": "Is that the sort of thing you tell them at your hospital?",
  "64796": "Who knows whether the sun is not a blind man?",
  "64797": "Now what is decay?",
  "64798": "What advantage should I have over you, if knowing your secret I were to tell you mine?",
  "64799": "What were you trying to do with all your signs?",
  "64800": "Are we to take him up to her?",
  "64801": "What will she do?",
  "64802": "What do you talk so for?",
  "64803": "That who was here?",
  "64804": "Where could I get a drink?",
  "64805": "What do you mean by that?",
  "64806": "What shall we learn from THAT stuff?",
  "64807": "Is it nearly finished?",
  "64808": "And where is my wife?",
  "64809": "Well, then, you made the boating man believe that he was the father, did you not?",
  "64810": "If society is binding on the boat, is it also binding on the provisions?",
  "64811": "But tell me, do you think I am so beautiful?",
  "64812": "What finer retinue could be expected for his funeral?",
  "64813": "And is it not the very diagnostic of true salvation that it shall overcome the fear of death?",
  "64814": "You do not mean to ride, gentlemen?",
  "64815": "May I mention something?",
  "64816": "Why don't you leave me alone?",
  "64817": "You understand how those things are managed?",
  "64818": "But what would become of this human imago in a state of perfect bliss?",
  "64819": "What are all systems, religious, political, or scientific, but opinions resting on evidence more or less satisfactory?",
  "64820": "Perhaps that you're searching far too much?",
  "64821": "And do you know whither he went?",
  "64822": "Did some marine monster come from time to time, to breathe at the bottom of this well?",
  "64823": "Then, of course, you can read and write quite correctly?",
  "64824": "Have we any of us any friends there?",
  "64825": "You wouldn't want any one to do you out of your chance to get your rights, would you?",
  "64826": "Then I shall be of no use to your majesty?",
  "64827": "What did I care about paradise?",
  "64828": "And now how was I to proceed to reconstruct this midnight drama?",
  "64829": "It is, is it, sir?",
  "64830": "It doesn't seem likely she'd stop having them all at once when she's been so in the habit of it, does it?",
  "64831": "Wasn't it awful?",
  "64832": "Shall we try to catch it?",
  "64833": "Where could she find it?",
  "64834": "Well, what have you proved?",
  "64835": "Don't the very greatest ladies of all talk about that small clique of persons to whom they belong?",
  "64836": "This way, or that way?",
  "64837": "Don't you think the fowl may have come out of the country, aunt?",
  "64838": "How did he strike you, prince?",
  "64839": "Have not your fathers taught you this, I say, whilst as yet ye were but children?",
  "64840": "Bounderby?",
  "64841": "But, it will be said, is this all that pure reason can effect, in opening up prospects beyond the limits of experience?",
  "64842": "Isn't that strange?",
  "64843": "Why cannot man be content to live alone and be happy, and let the women live alone and be happy too?",
  "64844": "Can equality, by the right of succession, be preserved between citizens, as well as between cousins and brothers?",
  "64845": "Ay, and ashamed of it too?",
  "64846": "Cadby's death was from drowning, you say?",
  "64847": "Where's this young lady I've been hearing such a lot about?",
  "64848": "Why, then, didn't you reply?",
  "64849": "And how did it happen?",
  "64850": "And you?",
  "64851": "Lor, if the devil don't get them, what's he good for?",
  "64852": "Do you think they are dead?",
  "64853": "Has it ever been done before?",
  "64854": "Who's that boy?",
  "64855": "Or do you know some reason why it suits your father's book to amalgamate as well as it suits mine?",
  "64856": "Had you not better light a candle?",
  "64857": "Do you know where he lives?",
  "64858": "Is there ony country where they talk i' that way?",
  "64859": "What did that mean, to kiss?",
  "64860": "And how was she to punish her?",
  "64861": "Tyler appointed him?",
  "64862": "Had the nervous strain resulted in a hallucination, or did the door really move?",
  "64863": "Could she not be brought for just one little instant?",
  "64864": "Can you see me?",
  "64865": "Then to put the question is to solve the problem?",
  "64866": "Can you row up?",
  "64867": "Holding up a bank?",
  "64868": "To meet you in this way, on the sly?",
  "64869": "And what's a sonne?",
  "64870": "What am I to say to him?",
  "64871": "And in the first place, he will honour studies which impress these qualities on his soul and disregard others?",
  "64872": "And you couldn't remember?",
  "64873": "Would I come and look at it?",
  "64874": "Did you remark the postmarks of those letters?",
  "64875": "Do you see what I meant about the clothes falling off?",
  "64876": "Where is your escort?",
  "64877": "Is it necessary, pray, to illustrate a remark in so practical a style?",
  "64878": "Would he go and describe his rough reception, or recount his exploit?",
  "64879": "What, in the name of everything hideous, did this mean?",
  "64880": "Are you going somewhere?",
  "64881": "Do you know her?",
  "64882": "What can have happened?",
  "64883": "I presume you know, gentlemen, to whom my friend is indebted for this piece of patronage?",
  "64884": "Among them odd heaps of old papers, this gentleman, when he comes into the property, naturally begins to rummage, don't you see?",
  "64885": "Why are you distressed?",
  "64886": "Are you going to have lunch too?",
  "64887": "And what is the means?",
  "64888": "And if I did know them now, what would it avail me?",
  "64889": "What would you have?",
  "64890": "Revels?",
  "64891": "Now will you believe I'm in earnest?",
  "64892": "Is the sun up?",
  "64893": "Oh, what's that?",
  "64894": "Is it the immediate object of this confidence, that you may at once ascertain that, with my knowledge?",
  "64895": "How large was it?",
  "64896": "Then had I not best send him about his business?",
  "64897": "What does it matter?",
  "64898": "Don't your store people trust you?",
  "64899": "Shall we invite him into our hearts?",
  "64900": "What have you done with her, then, if you have her no longer?",
  "64901": "Then you'll not be wanting me any more tonight, ma'am?",
  "64902": "Jane, do you hear that nightingale singing in the wood?",
  "64903": "Where could they be going?",
  "64904": "Won't you?",
  "64905": "Not in regular government pay and employment, to lay traps?",
  "64906": "But who could affirm, who would dare to say, that the amiable fellow did not really see that which his two companions would not see?",
  "64907": "You can't recommend anything for the boy, I suppose?",
  "64908": "What was it that she wanted of him?",
  "64909": "Where are the nearest?",
  "64910": "How has he drawn you to himself?",
  "64911": "Not even of sending me a scrap of stuff for a new dress?",
  "64912": "If he cuts off one of his own toes, or one of his assistants', would you be very much astonished?",
  "64913": "Was the weather hot or cold?",
  "64914": "Where was my baggage?",
  "64915": "Authority?",
  "64916": "Tell him or not tell him?",
  "64917": "O you will let me hold your brave hand, stranger?",
  "64918": "You think so, my lord?",
  "64919": "In your left ear?",
  "64920": "Am I a soothsayer?",
  "64921": "Who shall live up to the great trust?",
  "64922": "Are we there already?",
  "64923": "And my council dares to temper and negotiate?",
  "64924": "How are you?",
  "64925": "But what?",
  "64926": "It was you, was it not?",
  "64927": "Am I not by?",
  "64928": "Have you given up loving her altogether?",
  "64929": "What good does it do?",
  "64930": "You have never heard her nephew play?",
  "64931": "And what is thy want?",
  "64932": "What sin, mademoiselle?",
  "64933": "Or that it is impossible to draw more than one right line betwixt any two points?",
  "64934": "Do you think I could ever skip like that?",
  "64935": "Can you send me to the station?",
  "64936": "When did you leave service?",
  "64937": "Well, what do you think of that?",
  "64938": "What DO you know of him?",
  "64939": "What good will he be to the tribe?",
  "64940": "What, did you come digging here entirely because of me?",
  "64941": "Do you feel that you have lost her?",
  "64942": "What, senor?",
  "64943": "Or the raspberry?",
  "64944": "What is there?",
  "64945": "What have you been after?",
  "64946": "You don't mean to say he stole money, do you?",
  "64947": "But who are all these?",
  "64948": "Well, what d'you think of it?",
  "64949": "Oh, I?",
  "64950": "You couldn't write?",
  "64951": "You here again?",
  "64952": "You have no trouble, I hope, to keep you waking?",
  "64953": "What is, or was, their address?",
  "64954": "But of what disease, then, did she die?",
  "64955": "Trodden upon by whom?",
  "64956": "Mighty men?",
  "64957": "No, but what do you mean?",
  "64958": "Yes, I am out of temper, and do you know why?",
  "64959": "Did you ever hear anything like your brother's eloquence?",
  "64960": "And what is the use of a fellow having a little money if it does not make him independent?",
  "64961": "Why have you no pride?",
  "64962": "Who are you, that you are to play with two young people's affections and break their hearts at your will?",
  "64963": "Yes?",
  "64964": "You mean, will it be prudent?",
  "64965": "What is justice?",
  "64966": "How so?",
  "64967": "Weren't you listening to me?",
  "64968": "What's in it?",
  "64969": "Did he himself find no cause for laughter on the earth?",
  "64970": "And who completed it as it now is?"
