  "1313": "Are we going to take him as a servant?",
  "1314": "Why so fierce?",
  "1315": "For what is it we call a man of birth, but one who is descended from a long succession of rich and powerful ancestors, and who acquires our esteem by his relation to persons whom we esteem?",
  "1316": "Would you mind telling me, so that I can see whether you are not mistaken?",
  "1317": "How are your brains?",
  "1318": "Could any government do more to train the people in the way in which he would have them go?",
  "1319": "After all, what good was this?",
  "1320": "You mean perhaps to be a painter?",
  "1321": "For whom was the first appointment?",
  "1322": "Well, what should I have done?",
  "1323": "Where's my considering cap?",
  "1324": "How did you come by this letter?",
  "1325": "One or other?",
  "1326": "Would he arouse him with a throb of agony?",
  "1327": "But, really, for mercy's sake, prince, what have I done?",
  "1328": "Has anything happened?",
  "1329": "Come up on the tramp?",
  "1330": "What was he doing on the tower?",
  "1331": "What did they contain of pleasure, of happiness, or of grief?",
  "1332": "What do you mean, cousin?",
  "1333": "But then, when you wish to embark, you are obliged to come to the surface of the water?",
  "1334": "What has he in his arms?",
  "1335": "For what now was the first thing you were taught?",
  "1336": "Shall we yield ourselves to him?",
  "1337": "Will you enter, and see my wife?",
  "1338": "Could it then be possible?",
  "1339": "What are these imperious sympathies?",
  "1340": "Could this, too, be a wig?",
  "1341": "Do you consider it an accidental case, prince?",
  "1342": "Will you add these twenty francs to the seven you have?",
  "1343": "And you failed?",
  "1344": "Then you know nothing of the city?",
  "1345": "Was that wise?",
  "1346": "They had a youth with them?",
  "1347": "Were they intelligent mechanisms?",
  "1348": "Are you in a place?",
  "1349": "Warn her?",
  "1350": "Shall we have it up here, or go down to the restaurant?",
  "1351": "And you say that one of your friends lives in that house?",
  "1352": "What does he send me?",
  "1353": "He was only talking to himself, saying 'Over, is it?",
  "1354": "And would not the deficiencies of one year be made up for by the surplus of another?",
  "1355": "I understood, of course, that he saw something, but what?",
  "1356": "Where did you find so many diamonds?",
  "1357": "But tell me, senor, what do you call this excellent and rare adventure that has left us as we are left now?",
  "1358": "Why should you get into such a tantrum about nothing?",
  "1359": "Are you not nearly spent with the heat?",
  "1360": "Do you think you are where you used to be?",
  "1361": "Then the eleventh day must have been a holiday?",
  "1362": "But what can you expect of a creature from the deanery?",
  "1363": "The children?",
  "1364": "You are, doubtless, acquainted with a variety of languages, so as to have been able to read all these?",
  "1365": "What makes you think that?",
  "1366": "Why then are we to believe the same thing of another girl whom we never saw, told by nobody knows who, nor when, nor where?",
  "1367": "Were they going to let him alone this time?",
  "1368": "Had you commissioned me?",
  "1369": "And you remember that we came up with the two in a ditch, and that there was a scuffle between them, and that one of them had been severely handled and much mauled about the face by the other?",
  "1370": "What has the change been?",
  "1371": "And where is the next point?",
  "1372": "It is not such a very dreadful circumstance that we are odd people, is it?",
  "1373": "What says my nephew?",
  "1374": "Who's firing?",
  "1375": "Mamma, are you cross?",
  "1376": "Perhaps you think the poor might have their part?",
  "1377": "Then I am to blow my brains out?",
  "1378": "What is it then, for goodness' sake?",
  "1379": "Poison him?",
  "1380": "And do you hear?",
  "1381": "What shall we do?",
  "1382": "Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?",
  "1383": "What's this paper?",
  "1384": "Then it was to go to her that you left us?",
  "1385": "Are we not endowed with inner force to fight successfully against obstacles and difficulties, and to wrest trophies of glory from hardships?",
  "1386": "Then I am condemned, sire?",
  "1387": "Could he be trying to measure the thickness of the crust of the earth that lay between us and the world above?",
  "1388": "What do you mean to do about this you have seen?",
  "1389": "But your old friends of the musketeers?",
  "1390": "How to get rid of him?",
  "1391": "Each time there had been no sentence of importance which she could relate, and as for the glances and sensations, what woman would reveal them?",
  "1392": "Go and call upon this girl?",
  "1393": "Till he yield to me?",
  "1394": "You're back from leave, I suppose?",
  "1395": "Where are the papers of this prisoner?",
  "1396": "I say, friends, have you heard?",
  "1397": "Well, I said, and how does the change from oligarchy into democracy arise?",
  "1398": "Will you let them come?",
  "1399": "I mean that are not there now?",
  "1400": "Why have they not got rid of him?",
  "1401": "And will you tell me what a gentleman is?",
  "1402": "Were you in love with him?",
  "1403": "Does a woman ever know how much such speeches cost?",
  "1404": "How is this seeming miracle accomplished?",
  "1405": "Do you not humble me if you are too proud to accept what is due to you from my brother?",
  "1406": "Did you have a nice walk?",
  "1407": "Would it not be more like a man to go before his face, and take the satisfaction of a warrior?",
  "1408": "How much does the hire amount to since yesterday?",
  "1409": "Have you heard the password?",
  "1410": "But where are the huts?",
  "1411": "Why should all the parts and organs of many independent beings, each supposed to have been separately created for its proper place in nature, be so invariably linked together by graduated steps?",
  "1412": "What would be the use?",
  "1413": "But how did she become so?",
  "1414": "As before?",
  "1415": "But can the crude fruit of casual observation, never brought to the test of judgment, formed by comparing speculation and experience, deserve such a distinction?",
  "1416": "But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge?",
  "1417": "How can it be foreign?",
  "1418": "Which of your uncles do you like best?",
  "1419": "And what is it to be?",
  "1420": "That we may find it necessary to punish the injury you have done to us?",
  "1421": "Ex tempore?",
  "1422": "Their father is dead?",
  "1423": "Or what is gone with my lords your brethren?",
  "1424": "Well, then, how about the land?",
  "1425": "What business have you at all with these interviews?",
  "1426": "How long was she there?",
  "1427": "But may I regard certain arrangements, which seemed to have been made in conformity with some fixed aim, as the arrangements of design, and look upon them as proceeding from the divine will, with the intervention, however, of certain other particular arrangements disposed to that end?",
  "1428": "A whole bottle?",
  "1429": "Moved?",
  "1430": "Is he not a man of honour and feeling?",
  "1431": "For if we fail in this our fight he must surely win, and then where end we?",
  "1432": "The great question certainly was, what?",
  "1433": "He supposed he was right?",
  "1434": "Is nothing due to the man whom we have all such reason to love, and no reason in the world to think ill of?",
  "1435": "But when you are not sure whether it is a fact or not, what are you to do?",
  "1436": "Would you like to see 'em?",
  "1437": "Which of the two?",
  "1438": "Has either of them confided anything to you by word of mouth?",
  "1439": "Has he ploughed, sowed, reaped, mowed, winnowed, weeded?",
  "1440": "Opposite the scaffold?",
  "1441": "Has anyone gone for the opossum?",
  "1442": "Apiece?",
  "1443": "Monseigneur assures me that the devil has nothing to do with this?",
  "1444": "Well, is it not noble to defend the poets, and introduce to the public all the new scientific and political ideas?",
  "1445": "Is this just?",
  "1446": "But how can you get there?",
  "1447": "Would you help me?",
  "1448": "What of the race, my pulse?",
  "1449": "What right had they to weep over or to talk about her?",
  "1450": "What's he like, this lad?",
  "1451": "What do you think, can a man be suffocated with a wet cloth?",
  "1452": "Is the loin pork enough?",
  "1453": "Put it straight, will you?",
  "1454": "Are you not, comrade?",
  "1455": "How is that, my child?",
  "1456": "And what after that?",
  "1457": "Do you repent of your sins, and do you acknowledge death as a righteous expiation and punishment?",
  "1458": "Shall I serve my child by a lie?",
  "1459": "Hey, who's there?",
  "1460": "How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments?",
  "1461": "Is not death opposed to life?",
  "1462": "And how much will that pair of stockings be worth when she has finished them?",
  "1463": "Grimaud, why did you not tell me this?",
  "1464": "My superintendent would not find me any money?",
  "1465": "How came it yours?",
  "1466": "Besides, who is to choose the velvet and cut for this young dandy?",
  "1467": "Who wants a protector?",
  "1468": "ARE they memorials?",
  "1469": "Exactly of what else could a platform consist?",
  "1470": "Why are you making knots in that ribbon, and writing invisible characters on the floor with the point of that busy little foot?",
  "1471": "Of my own life?",
  "1472": "What do these sounds portend?",
  "1473": "And who knows it?",
  "1474": "Can you do it?",
  "1475": "Or are you going to keep it right alongside of us outrageous fellows?",
  "1476": "You consider that to be important?",
  "1477": "Should I?",
  "1478": "Has he, ma'am?",
  "1479": "What precaution?",
  "1480": "On his track?",
  "1481": "Was not he disguised?",
  "1482": "And the quilting of the stairs no where worn out, and bare?",
  "1483": "What have you there?",
  "1484": "You go back and watch that long, will you?",
  "1485": "Will they abandon them in misfortune?",
  "1486": "What, then, will you say?",
  "1487": "Why, is it hid all around?",
  "1488": "You think love is the ticket, do you?",
  "1489": "Old or young?",
  "1490": "Has no copy been taken?",
  "1491": "Do you love him, love him with all your heart and soul, with all the love your bosom can feel?",
  "1492": "And how do you feel about it?",
  "1493": "What are fireworks like?",
  "1494": "Whom am I and what am I?",
  "1495": "Oh, why had she sent her letter?",
  "1496": "Do you conceive me, gentlemen?",
  "1497": "To what, ma'am?",
  "1498": "But how much truth was behind it?",
  "1499": "What does it contain?",
  "1500": "Why should it break three inches from the top, as this one has done?",
  "1501": "Was it last evening that you came on board this vessel?",
  "1502": "And why not a bowl of rack punch as well as any other cause?",
  "1503": "Would it be some young man or other whom she takes an interest in?",
  "1504": "Is it absolutely necessary to go on with the letter, darling?",
  "1505": "Is that a genuine letter you are reading?",
  "1506": "What could be better?",
  "1507": "What has she been telling you?",
  "1508": "Why is that little, and the little freedom they enjoy, to be infringed?",
  "1509": "Had I been remanded to my dungeon, to await the next sacrifice, which would not take place for many months?",
  "1510": "Will she recover?",
  "1511": "Is that what you mean?",
  "1512": "But now that virtue has become to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into bitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy?",
  "1513": "What do you mean by going with other men, anyway?",
  "1514": "What would be the end?",
  "1515": "Feelin' sick?",
  "1516": "Determine on what?",
  "1517": "And yet what?",
  "1518": "Why risk the world's great empire for a punk?",
  "1519": "You mean, spend too much money?",
  "1520": "Nose and all?",
  "1521": "And will you answer it?",
  "1522": "How, then, will competition be harmoniously determined in society?",
  "1523": "Have I got to drink that stuff?",
  "1524": "Ruined her?",
  "1525": "So that I need not make use of this petition?",
  "1526": "But what do you conclude from that, father?",
  "1527": "What took place?",
  "1528": "Will you give your honour not to fire while we talk?",
  "1529": "What's the use of that?",
  "1530": "What's fame?",
  "1531": "Where would be the use of it?",
  "1532": "My purpose, for why should I deny it?",
  "1533": "Do you contradict me?",
  "1534": "What makes you so smitten with that little vermin?",
  "1535": "But how did you get in here?",
  "1536": "Where was the man flying to after such dreadful retaliation?",
  "1537": "Why not still proceed over the untamed yet obedient element?",
  "1538": "For, suppose the manufacturer, who seems to make this profit on his property, wishes also to make it on his merchandise, can he then pay himself one franc for that which cost him ninety centimes, and make money by the operation?",
  "1539": "Why then has he never taken part in public affairs?",
  "1540": "From that woman?",
  "1541": "Does not every merchant have his secret mark?",
  "1542": "And that others should approve of what we approve, is no miracle or impossibility?",
  "1543": "He will be a baronet, will he not?",
  "1544": "To what purpose?",
  "1545": "Can you pray?",
  "1546": "And can his majesty count upon many such subjects as yourself for his flight?",
  "1547": "What became of him?",
  "1548": "How many arms have you there ready for distribution?",
  "1549": "Will you come and see me?",
  "1550": "What makes you suppose I know?",
  "1551": "But what am I to do with the brute?",
  "1552": "What nonsense is this?",
  "1553": "Where was she now?",
  "1554": "How do you explain the influence the count evidently possessed over those ruffians?",
  "1555": "What is the idea of you buying a fox skin, you poor beggar?",
  "1556": "Lost confidence?",
  "1557": "How could he have chosen a better friend in whom to trust?",
  "1558": "In the same way?",
  "1559": "What was your remark, my dear friend?",
  "1560": "Why do you answer me so roughly?",
  "1561": "What's going to become of us now?",
  "1562": "And what will the be the good of your going on after that?",
  "1563": "Is it right?",
  "1564": "Be terrorized by every prating paper?",
  "1565": "Are many of the young ladies with you?",
  "1566": "Oh, she thinks me too meek?",
  "1567": "Sparking plugs, eh?",
  "1568": "Was he alone, that long night, whose brave, loving spirit was bearing up, in that old shed, against buffeting and brutal stripes?",
  "1569": "I am out of all that, am I not?",
  "1570": "Have there not been religions indisputably on a moral level lower than that of the community which they represent?",
  "1571": "What are you going to do next?",
  "1572": "Who was her father?",
  "1573": "In fact, has ANYTHING ever been done by government for the interest of the private settler?",
  "1574": "And what is human omnipotence?",
  "1575": "So you have brought him thither from the barricade?",
  "1576": "But what would you say of equal portions of wood and stone, or other material equals?",
  "1577": "Have I anything to pay?",
  "1578": "Do they think to have to do with a ninnywhoop, to feed you thus with cakes?",
  "1579": "Is it at the city of the stones or in the garden of the palms?",
  "1580": "What the devil are you waiting for?",
  "1581": "I suppose that none of these securities have been found among the property of the dead man?",
  "1582": "Chance?",
  "1583": "Oh, you want a knife?",
  "1584": "But who will distribute these things?",
  "1585": "Who wrote the letter?",
  "1586": "I suppose that you would know him when you saw him?",
  "1587": "Then, under the influence either of poverty or of wealth, workmen and their work are equally liable to degenerate?",
  "1588": "Are there any newspapers now?",
  "1589": "Who is that other person?",
  "1590": "Was she not horribly bedizened with velvet and pearls, with velvet and pearls, too, which had been torn off her back?",
  "1591": "Why should you have?",
  "1592": "What would you do yourself?",
  "1593": "How do you mean, forgotten?",
  "1594": "D'Imfreville?",
  "1595": "To get more knocks?",
  "1596": "Could it be possible, he continued, that eyes which as they gazed never expressed any divergence from what the tongue was telling, were yet ever seeing another world behind her ostensible one, discordant and contrasting?",
  "1597": "Hulloa, where have you sprung from?",
  "1598": "What can I say?",
  "1599": "But what can we do with him?",
  "1600": "To encourage him to continue poaching?",
  "1601": "Then why do people go there?",
  "1602": "Does any one scruple, in extraordinary cases, to violate all regard to the private property of individuals, and sacrifice to public interest a distinction which had been established for the sake of that interest?",
  "1603": "If the profits has turned out to be none, lackin' considable, and none to carry, is it my fault any more'n it's yourn?",
  "1604": "Lily, will you be mine?",
  "1605": "How can it be?",
  "1606": "Do you reckon you can learn me?",
  "1607": "What do you want to do?",
  "1608": "Might I have a buttonhole first?",
  "1609": "Come, be a good boy, what's her name?",
  "1610": "My sister stolen away?",

  "1632": "Have we any chance of escape, captain?",
  "1633": "What could I do when he reminded me that I could not keep my parish unless certain sums were paid?",
  "1634": "Then how you going to know which one to go for?",
  "1635": "What else should I have done with the stuff?",
  "1636": "What was he to say to this?",
  "1637": "What are we here for at all?",
  "1638": "But suppose we were to drink a mouthful in the mean time, for this air is stifling?",
  "1639": "Indeed, is it likely that a people with so many names has any actual existence?",

  "2137": "Could it be possible that the sense of unreality in which he felt himself imprisoned had communicated itself to his wife?",
  "2138": "Why alas?",
  "2139": "What do you mean by that, monsieur?",
  "2140": "After having met with so many who promised, when shall I find one who will give?",

  "2145": "I love you, I?",
  "2146": "Surely there is no necessity for you to say one word, mama?",
  "2147": "That's eight months she has been away, surely?",
  "2148": "Who shall go in?",
  "2149": "Will you sell them for five francs?",
  "2150": "Why negotiate, and above all why retreat, when to retreat is so contrary to his method of conducting war?",
  "2151": "You wanted to speak to her?",
  "2152": "But am I not your nearest relative?",
  "2153": "Then what do you think, mother, has become of 'em?",
  "2154": "You have written to your father?",
  "2155": "Ought it not?",
  "2156": "Did he tell you so himself?",
  "2157": "The ladies are great observers, sir?",
  "2158": "Are you come to do anything in my way, sir?",
  "2159": "Have you honours?",
  "2160": "Suppose, now, I could give you up to a rich man who would be able to insure you against all wants?",

  "2168": "What put that in your head?",
  "2169": "Was it not enough that their king's consort and sister was a prisoner in her lifetime, but she must, now she is dead also, be but meanly and obscurely buried?",
  "2170": "Had she never looked for the door?",
  "2171": "Everything?",
  "2172": "Do you think he will object to it?",
  "2173": "What think you of such a song as this?",
  "2174": "Have they not heard that of their colonel?",
  "2175": "Who was the gentleman?",
  "2176": "How could he have me in view, and not be aware of it himself?",
  "2177": "What is your name?",
  "2178": "How did I take to it?",
  "2179": "And she is getting on well, you say?",

  "2181": "Are you mad?",
  "2182": "And what does it mean?",
  "2183": "Now, then, who are you?",
  "2184": "Why do I wish to unite you two?",
  "2185": "Do I look like a sweep, then?",
  "2186": "Why, how fail to understand?",
  "2187": "You understand me?",
  "2188": "Brownlow, I believe, sir?",
  "2189": "Why have I always to complain of you?",
  "2190": "Why do you pity them?",
  "2191": "Whose fault was it that at the hours when workingmen were going to their work and back, the cars were so crowded that the conductors could not collect all the fares?",
  "2192": "Yes, but could not the mistake be rectified?",
  "2193": "What is the matter, said he, my chicken?",
  "2194": "Am I not to know to whom to present it?",
  "2195": "I say, madam, what do you propose to do with these papers?",
  "2196": "Are we ready?",
  "2197": "Have you any better explanation?",
  "2198": "Who was it gave me that rogues' march from the stocks to the gallows's foot?",
  "2199": "Why, pray?",
  "2200": "Now could I speak of that which is not yet?",
  "2201": "What is the proprietor?",
  "2202": "Would you mind stepping in for a moment?",
  "2203": "Shall I say yes or shall I say no?",
  "2204": "What should you be out of spirits for?",
  "2205": "Do you always want to be fooled?",
  "2206": "At this last moment I ask you, have we not long been betrothed to each other in our secret hearts?",
  "2207": "When did this happen?",
  "2208": "Something about somebody laughing at a locksmith?",
  "2209": "For what are you fighting?",
  "2210": "And that is adding insult to injury, is it?",
  "2211": "And where will I look for 'em?",
  "2212": "Gentlemen, is that a true view of the case?",
  "2213": "It was with a hilted knife maybe?",
  "2214": "Was he really doing everything that could be expected of him?",
  "2215": "How fare ye?",
  "2216": "What noise was that?",
  "2217": "But will the person who shall accompany you afterward be a man or a woman?",
  "2218": "Yes, but how am I to give it up?",

  "2236": "What else had she herself meant three minutes before by speaking of her as great?",
  "2237": "Why has the legislator given hands to this conspiracy of monopolies, to this interdict upon theories belonging to all?",
  "2238": "And do you suppose it weighs on him any less than on you?",
  "2239": "Do you wish these proofs, these attestations, which I alone possess, to be destroyed?",
  "2240": "Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?",
  "2241": "You do not like?",
  "2242": "You are going to be married?",
  "2243": "And will you, sir, get your living by the counsel of traitors?",
  "2244": "What happened in the house?",
  "2245": "Why do you not ask the fisherman for his cutlass?",

  "2255": "How does my sweet lady?",
  "2256": "And what was his purpose?",
  "2257": "Ah, you know it?",
  "2258": "But with a beard, you tell me?",
  "2259": "But, on the other hand, whose blood was that which lay so thickly upon the floor?",
  "2260": "Well, what did you see, sir, or think you saw?",
  "2261": "What was taking place within him?",
  "2262": "What did you force me to run away with you for?",
  "2263": "Besides, can any one be afraid of a war abroad, and that with such as will have comparatively much greater moderation than our own people have?",
  "2264": "Did I groan all right?",
  "2265": "Known what?",
  "2266": "You, my poor child, suffer poverty and hunger?",
  "2267": "Was it by his extensive knowledge, by his exquisite judgment, or by his heroic valour?",
  "2268": "Whose language would he speak?",
  "2269": "Perhaps you would care to try?",
  "2270": "Why should he change his name in a country where no one knew his original one?",
  "2271": "What can it know about the matter?",
  "2272": "Shall we begin education with music, and go on to gymnastic afterwards?",
  "2273": "Shall we try it?",

  "2279": "Am I to say what you told me?",
  "2280": "What could be more just?",
  "2281": "How many shots?",
  "2282": "Why did he leave?",
  "2283": "For why should the sterility be so extremely different in degree, when various species are crossed, all of which we must suppose it would be equally important to keep from blending together?",
  "2284": "Well, and what then?",
  "2285": "Do you pity him?",
  "2286": "To be cased up and hung by on the wall?",
  "2287": "Sword?",

  "2316": "And will you tell me what you read therein, monseigneur?",
  "2317": "Would it not be a wilful throwing away of a chance not to avail himself of it?",

  "2375": "D'you think I've changed since you were here last?",
  "2376": "Did I do right, monsieur?",
  "2377": "That's the riddle, what does she want?",
  "2378": "And what do you learn about them?",
  "2379": "Still at it, then?",
  "2380": "What is the next dean to have, twelve or fifteen?",

  "2394": "I suppose you've made pretty speeches to a girl before now?",
  "2395": "What was this ruffian religiously absorbed in the adoration of a virgin, watching over her, rearing her, guarding her, dignifying her, and enveloping her, impure as he was himself, with purity?",
  "2396": "How much did the girl receive?",
  "2397": "Why an I interrupted when I am engaged on business?",

  "2544": "What has become of it?",
  "2545": "Why should you trouble yourself with these?",
  "2546": "Is there any measure of the degree of rationality of the social will itself?",
  "2547": "Are they all off?",
  "2548": "Who is he lawgiver of the nations?",
  "2549": "My friend, what do you mean by that?",
  "2550": "But if he does not love you, will you cease to do so?",
  "2551": "What could the law do?",
  "2552": "May I not hope for the privilege?",
  "2553": "Now, supposing that he broke away during or after the tragedy, where could he have gone to?",
  "2554": "Do you think he will make another attempt?",

  "2561": "The only question is, how did he depart?",
  "2562": "You are two friends of mine who are in want of a billet, and what could be more natural than that I should bring you both round to the managing director?",
  "2563": "How can we return it?",
  "2564": "Is he drunk?",
  "2565": "Why should I obtain you by violence, if our love is mutual?",
  "2566": "And so, my pretty girl, you've come on a friendly visit to us, as relations?",
  "2567": "And if he did, what would it be to see a woman going by?",
  "2568": "Did he touch ye, boy?",
  "2569": "What name shall I say to my father?",
  "2570": "You ask his pardon?",
  "2571": "How do you mean to get a husband for her, eh?",
  "2572": "But the signora?",

  "2584": "You see that door there?",
  "2585": "Jude, will you leave me to myself now?",
  "2586": "What then can he mean when he says that I am the wisest of men?",
  "2587": "You intend to travel, sir, as I'm informed?",
  "2588": "Is she then deserted?",
  "2589": "And why should you not stand in her way?",
  "2590": "Been overdoing it?",
  "2591": "How did you happen to go down there?",
  "2592": "Is it those gray eyes whose glance penetrates you like a gimlet and remains there like the point of an arrow?",
  "2593": "Oh, how can you say so?",
  "2594": "Think so?",
  "2595": "It's on the house?",
  "2596": "Was it not strange that this tress should have remained as it was in life, when not an atom of the body on which it grew was in existence?",
  "2597": "Do you think we may look into it?",
  "2598": "What has been the matter, sir?",
  "2599": "What do you mean by a good horse?",
  "2600": "Who has been married here, my friend?",

  "2614": "How does he do it?",
  "2615": "Is that your opinion, captain?",
  "2616": "Whatever are you both doing down here?",
  "2617": "Is she, uncle?",

  "2641": "You had my wire?",
  "2642": "Why was he there at such an hour?",
  "2643": "What marvel is this?",
  "2644": "Now, if I were to take advantage of the darkness to slip down to the poor fellow?",
  "2645": "The lady, eh?",
  "2646": "What have ye?",
  "2647": "How high was it?",

  "2652": "Do the children arise from this copulation more uniformly, than does the parents care for their safety and preservation?",
  "2653": "You would have noticed it if he had?",
  "2654": "Is it to have the pleasure of insulting us that you say that, my little viper?",
  "2655": "Is that the only appointment you held about the cardinal?",
  "2656": "Will that meet the situation, sir?",
  "2657": "This young lady is your friend?",
  "2658": "Do you use your mistress' best saucers for that?",
  "2659": "And then you would like me as well as your father?",
  "2660": "Can I be of any use to you?",
  "2661": "What costume must he wear?",
  "2662": "Is he not able to pay the money?",
  "2663": "What are your commands, little countess?",
  "2664": "And what are his claims to the peerage?",
  "2665": "Did he speak in your hearing?",
  "2666": "What do you think you're doing?",
  "2667": "Is it racing they are?",
  "2668": "And do you also agree, I said, in describing the dialectician as one who attains a conception of the essence of each thing?",
  "2669": "Footsteps?",
  "2670": "Did that mischievous urchin give it to her?",
  "2671": "What can he have to say to me?",

  "2673": "The climate, I believe, is healthy?",
  "2674": "What shall be done to such an one?",
  "2675": "Now what was that great property?",
  "2676": "But why keep me in the dark?",

  "2721": "Not much time for it, I should say?",
  "2722": "But what have they been up to?",
  "2723": "Shall we then rest contented with these two relations of contiguity and succession, as affording a complete idea of causation?",
  "2724": "So that's the toon, is it?",
  "2725": "Should we no do a little what you call shopping for the babies, and haf a farewell feast tonight if I go for my last call at your so pleasant home?",
  "2726": "But you meant to stay another two days?",

  "2742": "YOU think he has run away, I suppose?",
  "2743": "Had the police seen us or had they hailed at random?",
  "2744": "Are you paid?",
  "2745": "But the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish?",
  "2746": "Do you mean to say, sir, that I should be a milestone?",
  "2747": "But on leaving the cafe must I walk to the right or the left?",
  "2748": "Has't not been tedious?",
  "2749": "And who's a funk, either?",
  "2750": "But how the devil did you learn all that?",
  "2751": "Would you not have been better with us?",
  "2752": "As we are going to take a walk, suppose we go and call upon him?",
  "2753": "Have you made inquiry?",
  "2754": "And may I, too, say how deeply touched I am by your coming here?",
  "2755": "You are honouring me with your attention?",
  "2756": "You will communicate with us again?",
  "2757": "What servant?",
  "2758": "And the nature of your expedition?",
  "2759": "Charlie?",
  "2760": "Will that do?",
  "2761": "What do you expect?",
  "2762": "Have I not gained the right to call them so?",
  "2763": "How he should go off then?",
  "2764": "It's true he has been reinstated, but how could they fail to do that?",
  "2765": "Are you quite sure that the needle touches the point?",
  "2766": "Why do you ask me that?",
  "2767": "What have you got to say?",
  "2768": "How's the pie?",
  "2769": "In the name of truth and common sense, why should not one woman acknowledge that she can take more exercise than another?",
  "2770": "Grab it?",

  "2777": "For the sake of morality?",
  "2778": "May I have the pleasure, he said, of hearing your opinion?",
  "2779": "Are you jealous of your wife, you stupid blockhead?",
  "2780": "Did you hear me tell you not to wait?",
  "2781": "And when did the war commence?",
  "2782": "So what is she so pleased about?",
  "2783": "What, then, had become of her, the former one, the one he had loved?",
  "2784": "Why had she lost it?",
  "2785": "But cannot one learn philosophy?",
  "2786": "What are we doing?",
  "2787": "Why, by forcing them to assist in this pillage, have they been made accomplices in it?",
  "2788": "What do you mean to do?",
  "2789": "Where's our man?",
  "2790": "Have you the writing still?",
  "2791": "In the one in which he was about to engage, what was his situation?",
  "2792": "Whose caleche is that?",
  "2793": "Nothing at all?",

  "2796": "What's the sense o' wastin' canvas?",
  "2797": "Farfrae?",
  "2798": "What, therefore, did they want with me?",
  "2799": "What do you think of my cape?",
  "2800": "Who hinders you?",

  "2802": "Among my friends of other times?",
  "2803": "Would he be able to acknowledge her through everything, or would he use her just as his instrument, use her for his own private satisfaction, not admitting her?",
  "2804": "Yes, but how do you account for her having such an impulse?",
  "2805": "How could they get in?",
  "2806": "What was the past to me as soon as I met you?",
  "2807": "Which way, sonny?",
  "2808": "Had I nothing about me I could offer in exchange for one of these rolls?",
  "2809": "Why do you say all this here?",
  "2810": "For religion?",
  "2811": "Do you think we really want a new gospel?",
  "2812": "Well, whom do you think I mean to appoint in his place?",
  "2813": "Who does live beyond forty?",
  "2814": "Who is it?",
  "2815": "What human being would ever have conceived the idea of such a journey?",

  "2817": "What would you do with your children?",
  "2818": "Should they go to the back or front door?",
  "2819": "But had it been on the wharf, that this was done?",
  "2820": "Now, tell me, are there any shops open at this hour of the night?",
  "2821": "What was there to so overcome me, as was the case?",
  "2822": "What prevents you from being so?",
  "2823": "Was it love that she had felt for him a year ago when she married him?",
  "2824": "Eternity?",
  "2825": "Are they not lovely?",
  "2826": "I hope you've got your hair well fastened on?",

  "2834": "But you know I wrote to her?",
  "2835": "What restrained her?",
  "2836": "Is the luggage brought down?",
  "2837": "Is that what you call it when you make them, for terror as you say, do as you like?",
  "2838": "When is it dated?",
  "2839": "Her?",
  "2840": "With a major factor unusual in any proposition, how can stability, much less progress, be expected in any interest?",

  "2882": "Does it ever speak to you?",
  "2883": "A house on fire?",
  "2884": "Throw it up altogether?",
  "2885": "The cloister or a betrothed husband?",
  "2886": "Got any theory?",

  "4611": "What's the matter with you girls?",
  "4612": "Then why do they quarrel?",
  "4613": "Can we then for a moment believe that, if this had been so, tradition would have been absolutely silent on the matter?",
  "4614": "Is the power of declaring war necessary?",
  "4615": "Even if he enjoys peace and a truce with you and all your men, what matters that to me?",

  "4617": "I wonder if that will have a good effect?",
  "4618": "What horrible place are we in?",
  "4619": "Then there is no revenge?",
  "4620": "Do you imagine such a thing?",
  "4621": "You will do for me what you have done for the queen?",
  "4622": "Have you lived with the family long?",
  "4623": "Want to break up the line?",
  "4624": "Mercy, did you say?",
  "4625": "How is SHE?",
  "4626": "You saw me, perhaps, on the night of the convict hunt, when I was so imprudent as to allow the moon to rise behind me?",
  "4627": "Where are the gloves?",
  "4628": "Am I to understand that you say you love me?",
  "4629": "Is that clear?",
  "4630": "How be ye?",
  "4631": "Ah, by my crown, what's that?",
  "4632": "Are you glad to see me?",
  "4633": "What is our life but the very worst life?",
  "4634": "Well, what is to be done?",
  "4635": "Badly made up?",
  "4636": "What would happen?",
  "4637": "But, once more, how is that my fault?",
  "4638": "Until now?",
  "4639": "Is he an old offender?",
  "4640": "Which of these do we take?",
  "4641": "What old cove?",
  "4642": "Do you want us to fling ourselves headlong down these rocks?",

  "4644": "What do you make of the other?",
  "4645": "In what figure shall I give his heart the first impression?",
  "4646": "The inquiry being only into the circumstances touching the death of the deceased, it's not necessary to go beyond these facts, I suppose you'll agree?",
  "4647": "Have you knocked at that one?",
  "4648": "Today, this moment?",
  "4649": "Or had he in reality always been like this, commonplace and prosaic, and was it merely in her imagination that he had been wonderful?",
  "4650": "Have you only just come?",
  "4651": "What man?",
  "4652": "Why do the women wear these things?",
  "4653": "Given the laboratories, how are the investigators to be maintained?",
  "4654": "All ready there?",
  "4655": "Why should we not leave together?",
  "4656": "What did you do then, sir?",
  "4657": "What was the ebb and flow of this tragic meditation?",
  "4658": "Then you want me to go back there?",
  "4659": "But do they do right in ignoring the existence of violence and bloodshed in resistance to constituted authority?",
  "4660": "Harness, but how can I harness everything?",
  "4661": "How cruel is your goodness?",
  "4662": "But what good will it do?",
  "4663": "What will protect him?",
  "4664": "How can I be sure of this?",
  "4665": "What's death?",
  "4666": "What was amiss?",
  "4667": "Where are you going to dine then?",
  "4668": "What could you do?",
  "4669": "If he could not do it, and if, nevertheless, it behoved them to break off this match, by whom was it to be done if not by her?",
  "4670": "A monkey, then?",
  "4671": "Have you any idea who did?",
  "4672": "Who made the lemonade?",
  "4673": "How shall he stop all the holes and deliver himself from the vipers?",
  "4674": "And why should that particular hole in the ground have anything to do with it?",
  "4675": "Why did the doctor's wife give the clerk presents?",
  "4676": "Am I doing anything?",
  "4677": "What did you think?",
  "4678": "Is it all you expected of it?",
  "4679": "What is it that you know?",
  "4680": "Do you not think so?",
  "4681": "Is, then, the crown too heavy that I wear?",
  "4682": "Does he want to protect himself, or does he think I would not go alone?",
  "4683": "Has law and order come down to this?",
  "4684": "And have you had a good bonfire up there?",

  "4686": "What do we want of a saw?",
  "4687": "Shall I sew, read, cone, draw, or do all at once?",
  "4688": "How call you the fountain?",
  "4689": "Yea?",
  "4690": "Who would be left?",
  "4691": "And, if so, how far into the future should we look?",
  "4692": "You have seen inside, then?",
  "4693": "And what did I do?",
  "4694": "What good will it do?",
  "4695": "Would you let me fetch another pat of butter, ma'am?",
  "4696": "Where's some brandy?",
  "4697": "Do you think he'll do it?",
  "4698": "Or will a not fail when he does come?",
  "4699": "Has there been any mistake, has she been buried alive?",
  "4700": "Yes, why was it that he had not married?",
  "4701": "Have I not indeed been living in a dream?",
  "4702": "But you, my poor child?",
  "4703": "Who could resist the pleading of so wise and compassionate a judge?",
  "4704": "How long are you staying?",

  "4706": "I said just now, what good could come of it?",
  "4707": "May be a fraud?",
  "4708": "What's an engagement made of, do you suppose?",
  "4709": "I suppose you will be glad of variety and admiration?",
  "4710": "Do you think you can recover your lord by giving away thus to your grief?",
  "4711": "But where is the use?",
  "4712": "You're not going?",
  "4713": "With no work to do, nobody to worry us, and nobody to compete with?",
  "4714": "I know I've had it a long time, but where did I get it?",
  "4715": "Is she alone?",
  "4716": "What had taken place during this long sleep?",
  "4717": "When, finally, he was graduated a captain as well as a soldier, to what object should he address his efforts?",
  "4718": "Am I, or am I not, the queen?",
  "4719": "Could he do what he wanted to with the dollar?",
  "4720": "Because they give fevers?",

  "4722": "Now, then, mum?",
  "4723": "Who by?",
  "4724": "How can they laugh, or even live at all here?",
  "4725": "Who came here the last time?",
  "4726": "But what color can the objection have, when a specification of the objects alluded to by these general terms immediately follows, and is not even separated by a longer pause than a semicolon?",
  "4727": "What about poaching eggs?",
  "4728": "You know not the subject of their conversation?",
  "4729": "You would not fight a duel?",
  "4730": "Worth it, the little sacrifice, for whom?",
  "4731": "Is my son dead or unhorsed or so wounded that he cannot help himself?",
  "4732": "What about those rings you told me of?",
  "4733": "Little bamboos that creak together, tell me where he ran?",
  "4734": "Want a pilot, captain?",
  "4735": "There, what do you think now of the affair?",
  "4736": "Was there anything in your letter which might have unbalanced him or induced him to take such a step?",
  "4737": "How long was I what they called out of my senses?",
  "4738": "I am having a great holiday, am I not?",
  "4739": "In what strain should he do so?",
  "4740": "What was their case?",
  "4741": "Was your sister dressed?",
  "4742": "Where has he gone?",
  "4743": "What does it signify?",
  "4744": "And what did he do the rest of his time?",
  "4745": "What do you mean, then?",
  "4746": "You're not angry that I sent for you?",
  "4747": "Might I have a word with your lordship?",
  "4748": "But what had been in the box?",
  "4749": "May I prove my gratitude by explaining for once where my difficulty lies?",
  "4750": "And do you suppose, madam, that he would have no money left?",
  "4751": "Do you not see that all these soldiers of ours have been raised by us to the pitch of expectation?",
  "4752": "I afraid?",
  "4753": "Did you ever love such an one?",
  "4754": "And will the head's being bare cure the madness of yours?",
  "4755": "Is it worth while?",
  "4756": "Will you be good enough to come and see me?",
  "4757": "She is ready, is she?",
  "4758": "From whom else could they come?",
  "4759": "You do not need that name in order to live?",

  "4762": "Was he one of those two passengers?",
  "4763": "What is to become of us?",
  "4764": "Give every one their due, eh?",
  "4765": "What stone wall?",
  "4766": "How could I adore her more if I were married to one of the people you speak of?",
  "4767": "Do you think so?",
  "4768": "By what oaths can he bind himself?",
  "4769": "Will monseigneur have the kindness to say for what purpose?",
  "4770": "Of what burden is she?",
  "4771": "Do I amuse you?",
  "4772": "Come, is that enough, mamma, or do you intend to put any more questions?",
  "4773": "A lost art?",
  "4774": "Are you one of his men?",
  "4775": "Criminals?",
  "4776": "Who was the he?",
  "4777": "Why did you wish to stop my ears?",
  "4778": "Have you forgiven me?",
  "4779": "Will you refuse to do as I wish?",
  "4780": "Well, what did he talk about with you?",
  "4781": "Where is the forest man who went to rescue you?",
  "4782": "And what is the time limit for such reactions?",
  "4783": "But if, in the dawn of life, we could soberly survey the scenes before us as in perspective, and see every thing in its true colours, how could the passions gain sufficient strength to unfold the faculties?",
  "4784": "Will you not speak to me?",
  "4785": "What hour?",
  "4786": "What has brought him here at this time?",
  "4787": "I think I saw you in the park riding?",
  "4788": "Are we not?",
  "4789": "Why should love be a bond?",
  "4790": "And if you found him deserting to your enemies, what would you do?",
  "4791": "Who could have told you that?",
  "4792": "Why do we not arrive?",
  "4793": "Then, after all, it was given to me by the dean?",
  "4794": "May I have her at my party?",
  "4795": "But who said it was buried alive?",
  "4796": "May I call tomorrow?",
  "4797": "What was that?",
  "4798": "My wish?",
  "4799": "What's to do naow?",
  "4800": "I ask you, sir, how dare you do it?",
  "4801": "What have you gained?",
  "4802": "How have we handled our national finances?",
  "4803": "But if he be willing to accept my offers, will you oppose them?",
  "4804": "The next question of anxiety was, where would the balloon alight?",
  "4805": "She?",
  "4806": "How could you sing, sing like that while crying?",
  "4807": "My line?",
  "4808": "But will it hurt me?",
  "4809": "So you want to marry?",
  "4810": "How is that, my friend?",
  "4811": "Can destiny, then, be as malicious as an intelligent being, and become as monstrous as the human heart?",
  "4812": "What difference does that make?",
  "4813": "Would you be able to recognize that man again?",
  "4814": "And who the devil gave YOU leave to touch a stick about the place?",
  "4815": "You supposed he should have hung himself indeed?",
  "4816": "Of what kind were they?",
  "4817": "Have you a brother?",
  "4818": "Can you tell how?",
  "4819": "What the devil do you come in between me and my dog for?",
  "4820": "Did you see?",
  "4821": "I presume then that you are going to make one of the interdicted answers?",
  "4822": "And I?",
  "4823": "And good counsel is clearly a kind of knowledge, for not by ignorance, but by knowledge, do men counsel well?",
  "4824": "Do you understand me?",
  "4825": "Have not almost all the governments in the world always been in the wrong on religious subjects?",
  "4826": "Why do you make so much noise?",
  "4827": "Against whom?",
  "4828": "What was to be done in the rural districts?",
  "4829": "Ah, how many inhabitants could it support?",
  "4830": "And which to the mortal?",
  "4831": "But what do you make of the grandmother?",
  "4832": "How have we offended?",
  "4833": "And what about her?",
  "4834": "What business have you here?",
  "4835": "Is it just?",
  "4836": "What is that you say, my friend?",
  "4837": "Do you really?",
  "4838": "But what sort of a man was he?",
  "4839": "No use?",
  "4840": "Your real name you will not give?",
  "4841": "Has he not compounded a riddle, thinking to try me?",
  "4842": "And what shall we say about men?",
  "4843": "Have you no shame?",
  "4844": "Why weep you not to think upon my wrongs?",
  "4845": "Stranger, what is it?",
  "4846": "What shall I suffer and endure?",
  "4847": "Maybe you'll be very lonely, ma'am?",
  "4848": "What is it, little girl?",
  "4849": "But may not the tradition of it have descended from the discovery of comparatively late remains, by primitive man, of the winged saurians that crawled, swam, dived, or flew, lingering on till the later geologic period?",
  "4850": "The lady, sir?",
  "4851": "Oats?",
  "4852": "How long could they keep the pace?",
  "4853": "His uncle had deceived him, and might he not consign her to some miserable place where her youth and beauty would prove a far greater curse than ugliness and decrepitude?",
  "4854": "Who do you wish to see?",
  "4855": "How long is this for?",
  "4856": "What conceivable motive had they for doing so?",
  "4857": "Which way is the business part?",
  "4858": "And dressed?",
  "4859": "Why, cousin?",
  "4860": "Make you feel rotten?",
  "4861": "Do I ever take pains to have any secrets?",
  "4862": "Did you ever see her?",
  "4863": "How do you like my entrance?",
  "4864": "Can you rest here?",
  "4865": "Cruel?",
  "4866": "Will you never do anything?",
  "4867": "Beneath it?",
  "4868": "Is such a thing possible?",
  "4869": "Sorry for whom?",
  "4870": "Your leagues concluded, your engagements past?",
  "4871": "Why does he not come himself?",
  "4872": "Is anything the matter?",
  "4873": "Of what misdemeanor do you accuse him?",
  "4874": "And who did it?",
  "4875": "Only think what you are giving up here?",
  "4876": "And what would you call her?",
  "4877": "The boy is out, you say?",
  "4878": "What can make her amends for this privation, or where is she to seek for a fresh employment?",
  "4879": "But what's the southern army to do?",
  "4880": "What was passing in that brain, so loaded with dreadful secrets?",
  "4881": "Are you sure she said that?",
  "4882": "I do not know whether you have heard the whole story?",
  "4883": "How near were you?",
  "4884": "Surprise?",
  "4885": "And why should you object?",
  "4886": "But what are men?",
  "4887": "It that noble?",
  "4888": "Oh, what shall I call you?",
  "4889": "Will you come out with me again one evening?",
  "4890": "Then who is supporting you there?",
  "4891": "What is the difference, then, between the two customs?",
  "4892": "I wonder, captain, what they will say of my going away, ha?",
  "4893": "In such a world as this, what is the use of the enjoyment of pleasures, if he who has fed on them is to return to this world again and again?",
  "4894": "Why did you introduce a defective bill?",
  "4895": "And why then have you tempted me?",
  "4896": "And his name?",
  "4897": "Did he get well?",
  "4898": "Lend me a hanky, will you?",
  "4899": "Would you know how to buy it, my darling?",
  "4900": "When the tongue of an advocate once gets in motion, who can tell where it will stop?",
  "4901": "What was this?",

  "4904": "Of what consequence?",
  "4905": "Would you like me to get out the books now that your grandmother is going to give you for your birthday?",
  "4906": "What is it, then?",
  "4907": "Well, how are you?",
  "4908": "You've come back, have you?",
  "4909": "Now, if I grant that they cannot be employed in the sphere of experience, as constitutive principles, how shall I secure for them employment and objective validity as regulative principles, and in what way can they be so employed?",
  "4910": "How long have you had that cough ?",
  "4911": "Would you turn their distress into a malediction?",
  "4912": "Of what did the plebeians complain?",
  "4913": "Giry, do you know what is in this envelope?",
  "4914": "Are you sure of this?",
  "4915": "Or five?",
  "4916": "But how about the wine?",
  "4917": "Must I go in immediately?",
  "4918": "BROWN?",
  "4919": "See, now, my jealous lord, do I address such questions to you?",
  "4920": "What are laborers in relation to each other?",
  "4921": "What scoundrel struck that blow?",
  "4922": "I mean, would you have wished to paint her?",
  "4923": "You receive stolen goods, do you?",
  "4924": "What had he, a family man, to do with ventures beyond sea?",
  "4925": "Will you please tell him that a lady wishes to see him?",
  "4926": "A wa'at for me?",
  "4927": "Was there enough ice?",
  "4928": "But where will they lead us to?",
  "4929": "A fright?",
  "4930": "How can I help that, my boy?",
  "4931": "Can you have become untrue to your own heart?",
  "4932": "How then, sir, can I act, but by shewing my abhorrence of every step that makes towards my undoing?",
  "4933": "And you will not turn aside as you did just now?",
  "4934": "How is it?",
  "4935": "Said he, what's the matter?",
  "4936": "And was it not the manly thing for him to do?",
  "4937": "Was that kind?",
  "4938": "Is ever disaster nearer than when each solider thinks about his private safety only?",
  "4939": "Are you all clear, you, aft there?",
  "4940": "That is perhaps true, but what of it?",
  "4941": "Where may he be at present?",
  "4942": "Menneville, what do you want to do?",
  "4943": "But this coffer?",
  "4944": "The main question is, which of the two parents is more to be had in honour?",
  "4945": "We were too rich, were we?",
  "4946": "Are we not bound to carry our investigations to extremity?",
  "4947": "Can you read?",
  "4948": "What were we the worse for the former folly?",
  "4949": "Could I speak to you alone for a moment?",
  "4950": "Oh, you're the new articled clerk?",
  "4951": "What right thing?",
  "4952": "Stendhal?",
  "4953": "Will you go?",
  "4954": "Why, then, do you fear them?",
  "4955": "O how shall I know this?",
  "4956": "You want to see who they are?",
  "4957": "What stayed them?",
  "4958": "And I've got a tremendous will, have I?",
  "4959": "Oh, something in a philanthropic way?",
  "4960": "Oh, but how was it?",
  "4961": "But where are we drifting?",
  "4962": "But what were our managers doing?",
  "4963": "You are come to tell us it is time to be gone, have you not?",
  "4964": "Was the man a magician?",
  "4965": "Her brother?",
  "4966": "Do you not see what feigned prices, are set upon little stones and rarities?",
  "4967": "What, are there any greater still?",
  "4968": "Is she your cousin?",
  "4969": "What mystery could be hidden under this sign?",
  "4970": "To the cottage of her sister?",

  "4972": "Do I delight to die, or life desire?",
  "4973": "Why are you in low spirits?",
  "4974": "And you will leave me then?",
  "4975": "Was it an illusion, a mistake, an optical illusion?",
  "4976": "What principle of good faith, then, was violated?",

  "4979": "Who am I?",
  "4980": "Is it for you, who keep an inn, to treat passengers at this rate?",
  "4981": "And did you see him?",
  "4982": "Supposing, for instance, that they should suddenly hail a taxi?",
  "4983": "Have you anything interesting there?",
  "4984": "And you found yourselves suddenly on a mountain side?",
  "4985": "Why do you ever come back, then, at all?",
  "4986": "Will that be all?",
  "4987": "But what did I want crawling forward to scorch my understanding at her flaming brow?",
  "4988": "But if there were somewhere a being strong and beautiful, a valiant nature, full at once of exaltation and refinement, a poet's heart in an angel's form, a lyre with sounding chords ringing out elegiac epithalamia to heaven, why, perchance, should she not find him?",
  "4989": "You have only lately arrived?",
  "4990": "I shall have the comte's letter in eight hours?",
  "4991": "How can we with mortal eyes contemplate this image, whose celestial splendor the host of heaven presumes not to behold?",
  "4992": "How can it affect them?",
  "4993": "Ever seen one like it?",
  "4994": "How have I done what I have done?",

  "4999": "What are we all miserable for, when everything might be so happy?",
  "5000": "What did he say to me?",
  "5001": "I'm afraid you are ill?",
  "5002": "Why should she have been less prone to love than he was?",
  "5003": "In what time?",
  "5004": "How was it known that these letters were from me?",
  "5005": "Surely I never led you to expect such a thing?",
  "5006": "And is he aware of the danger he has been in?",
  "5007": "But why had his father taken up the board?",
  "5008": "What has become of him?",
  "5009": "And are not your own very lives in my hands?",
  "5010": "But we shall see you soon again, shall we not?",
  "5011": "I missed again?",
  "5012": "Am I boring you with all this?",
  "5013": "Are they, do you think?",
  "5014": "Do you realize that it's all your fault?",
  "5015": "My dear fellow, how are you?",
  "5016": "What does he appear to be?",
  "5017": "What were you doing?",
  "5018": "What is the relative age of this hymn?",
  "5019": "But if your honor knew this man?",
  "5020": "Do you think the lemon juice did any good?",
  "5021": "Am I to believe that?",
  "5022": "But your writing?",
  "5023": "Well, do you hear, sirrah?",
  "5024": "Was it in this room that you gave your instructions as to the copying of the document?",

  "5258": "To what party did he belong?",
  "5259": "Does that suggest nothing to you?",
  "5260": "Where away?",
  "5261": "How did you penetrate hither?",
  "5262": "Caught cold in the grottos, at night, perhaps?",
  "5263": "You are sure?",
  "5264": "Well, and what did the last one say to ye?",
  "5265": "Did you come in the gig?",
  "5266": "And the DISENCHANTMENT of woman is in progress?",
  "5267": "Had your breakfast yet?",
  "5268": "Could he write something original?",
  "5269": "Breakfast?",
  "5270": "Now what does this imply?",
  "5271": "What possessed him to turn listener?",
  "5272": "Is this not a quite unusual politeness?",
  "5273": "Whatever have you done now?",
  "5274": "Are these things nothing?",
  "5275": "Did my sons get power and money?",
  "5276": "If they are such a happy class of people, how was it that you had such a time of punishing and hanging them within the last two years?",
  "5277": "And I have no doubt she loves you like a brother?",
  "5278": "And what have you been thinking about THEM, my busy bee?",
  "5279": "But how will it be?",
  "5280": "Could anything exceed the picture he gives one of scientific ardour?",
  "5281": "There is no exit that way?",
  "5282": "But was he worse?",
  "5283": "Yet how long before it was unsettled again?",
  "5284": "Philanthropy's sake?",
  "5285": "Or are they late because they have had a lovers' meeting?",
  "5286": "Is he very ill?",
  "5287": "Did he know them before?",
  "5288": "Cranly asked softly, happier than you are now, for instance?",
  "5289": "Why, what on earth does she do here?",
  "5290": "What does it matter to me whether the prince is to be what the late king was?",
  "5291": "How can I urge my daughters now to go and raise large families?",
  "5292": "And what did it matter?",
  "5293": "What are you meddling with, stupid?",
  "5294": "Why do you specify the fox?",
  "5295": "Who said that?",
  "5296": "But you have found out something for yourself?",
  "5297": "What is filled with more real existence, and actually has a more real existence, is more really filled than that which is filled with less real existence and is less real?",

  "5300": "Are you not weary of that stupid, meaningless, constantly repeated fraud?",
  "5301": "I say, you're not putting off a party tonight, are you?",
  "5302": "Well, then, what'll we make him the ink out of?",
  "5303": "But, bishop, the question is, who has the power to settle it?",
  "5304": "What does friendship mean if it not so?",
  "5305": "Well, what time for repayment do you wish me to take?",
  "5306": "Whuzzis?",
  "5307": "Why is the hawk so hated by birds?",
  "5308": "About measures, or rhythms, or verses?",
  "5309": "What sort of young woman?",
  "5310": "Do you know where I shall find him?",
  "5311": "I sprung out of bed, and asked, what wreck?",
  "5312": "Are you sure this time?",
  "5313": "Would he have drawn back?",
  "5314": "Why must he go around hunting for some one who is supporting me or has supported me at some time in his life, and who has said something at some time contrary to that platform?",
  "5315": "Had ever a queen such a throne before?",
  "5316": "And what do YOU want?",
  "5317": "Or was he a debtor or a debtor's son?",
  "5318": "Not quite so far, I hope?",
  "5319": "You are not angry with me?",
  "5320": "For what is maintenance?",
  "5321": "What will you?",

  "5326": "And where did you hear it?",
  "5327": "What data could he expect from an uncleaned watch?",
  "5328": "But what is all this about?",
  "5329": "And destroy their lives, when they've helped me to remake mine?",
  "5330": "But need we fear anything beyond a momentary anger?",
  "5331": "And which are these two sorts?",
  "5332": "To drink?",
  "5333": "What shall we do, then, to push this great war of freedom and justice to its righteous conclusion?",
  "5334": "Will you get the mail, dear?",
  "5335": "Yes, very noble?",
  "5336": "Do you know where I am leading you?",
  "5337": "Did we notify them of this sage view of ours when we borrowed their money?",
  "5338": "Why did you form a monster so hideous that even YOU turned from me in disgust?",
  "5339": "Atone for a fault by paying money?",
  "5340": "How can you build on such a quicksand?",
  "5341": "The proper determination of these relations rests on the question, to what faculty of cognition they subjectively belong, whether to sensibility or understanding?",
  "5342": "Is that cough of his better?",
  "5343": "Why does he not look at me?",
  "5344": "From what house does the young noble come?",
  "5345": "But now how stands the wind?",
  "5346": "You promise me that frankness?",
  "5347": "And are you building?",
  "5348": "Would his uncle give him a place in the bank?",
  "5349": "Hearken to me, will you?",
  "5350": "What do you think, would they give us anything for it?",
  "5351": "Do you not know?",
  "5352": "How far does one of these little revolvers carry?",

  "5360": "Would he take her back to the beach or would he keep her here?",
  "5361": "Coom, wakken oop, will 'ee?",
  "5362": "And that principle which repels the musical, or the just?",
  "5363": "Why had he withheld life from her?",
  "5364": "Is life grievous to you?",
  "5365": "And are we to be carried on far and away into remote distance, and never, never to return?",
  "5366": "Why do you speak so?",
  "5367": "As for what you do me the honor to say, I presume you mean I was afraid?",
  "5368": "So, why not accept these sports as legitimate expressions of a normal and wholesome human nature?",
  "5369": "Whose camp are you in, those who bless or those who curse?",
  "5370": "Is it my mother?",
  "5371": "What is your opinion of it?",
  "5372": "How in the world did you deduce that?",
  "5373": "Now guess what the young one did?",
  "5374": "What money is there to be made here in any other way?",
  "5375": "But suppose she does come there?",

  "5378": "And silent all?",
  "5379": "What keeps them dancing till five o'clock in the morning through a whole mortal season?",
  "5380": "Why is it not seen that these ideas are mutually repellent, and that, if, by some impossibility, the proletaire could reach a certain degree of intelligence, he would make use of it in the first place to revolutionize society and change all civil and industrial relations?",
  "5381": "What can it be, then?",
  "5382": "Are you aware what you are saying, my lord?",
  "5383": "So much per man?",
  "5384": "What made you go away with him?",
  "5385": "Will all things be set right in the nation?",

  "5387": "What is this vessel?",
  "5388": "Devotion which is weary, heroism which has grown old, ambitions which are sated, fortunes which are made, seek, demand, implore, solicit, what?",
  "5389": "Would you venture to so consider them had they been committed by any nation on earth against the humblest of our people?",
  "5390": "He?",

  "5410": "A philosopher, perhaps?",
  "5411": "Is it likely?",
  "5412": "May I count upon your assistance?",
  "5413": "Are the eggs nice?",
  "5414": "Of tea with me over the fire?",
  "5415": "And now, my friend, as you cannot come to me, may I come to you?",
  "5416": "Why not today?",
  "5417": "What?",
  "5418": "Will you render me a little help?",
  "5419": "Are you scoffing at me?",

  "7479": "What more can he do?",
  "7480": "But who can be angry at those assiduities which are meant to please him?",
  "7481": "Does that kind go smoothly?",
  "7482": "Does it hurt?",
  "7483": "Where are you, old fellow?",
  "7484": "And have quite forgiven me?",
  "7485": "Did I say a word when he came and took me away, for no earthly reason, from the place where everybody was kind to me?",
  "7486": "How did you know it, then?",
  "7487": "Burning up your awld aunt's rubbidge, I suppose?",

  "7499": "You did not see her?",
  "7500": "Tell me what should you say, darling?",
  "7501": "But, in the name of heaven, man, where did you get these extraordinary clothes?",
  "7502": "You say you heard a knocking?",
  "7503": "But what is to be done now?",
  "7504": "But how did you feel when you were loved by a servant?",

  "7529": "Think only, what are my children to be?",
  "7530": "You were not content to hear me, eh?",
  "7531": "What have I done that this burden should be laid on me?",

  "7543": "How long would he be left uneducated?",
  "7544": "Only you here?",
  "7545": "Do you wish me to beg pardon of this creature because she has come here to insult our mother and disgrace the whole household, you low, base wretch?",
  "7546": "And the desire which goes beyond this, or more delicate food, or other luxuries, which might generally be got rid of, if controlled and trained in youth, and is hurtful to the body, and hurtful to the soul in the pursuit of wisdom and virtue, may be rightly called unnecessary?",

  "7548": "What does the presence do?",
  "7549": "Who would not suffer amid perfumed tapestries, cushioned furniture, and liveried servants?",
  "7550": "Well, and how are you?",
  "7551": "Yet who else in all the world was there with the strength and agility to do what this man was now doing?",
  "7552": "Why be uneasy?",
  "7553": "So you are going to sell the place?",
  "7554": "Is he still in a fit?",
  "7555": "But heavens, why?",
  "7556": "What might you be able to do?",

  "7573": "Did you ever see such a den, my dear?",
  "7574": "Yet why are those names disgraceful?",
  "7575": "Not damn the sharper, but the dice?",
  "7576": "And what IS her idea?",
  "7577": "Do you feel inclined to make the monks' acquaintance once more?",
  "7578": "What do you find to attract you in this poor drab little country?",
  "7579": "Are they little, then?",
  "7580": "What are you thinking about, doctor?",
  "7581": "Is it that the poets are deliberately trying to present the conditions of an age anterior to their own?",
  "7582": "What do you want me for, sir?",
  "7583": "Who spoke of such a thing?",
  "7584": "Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?",

  "7587": "What can it mean?",
  "7588": "Would you counsel him to do so?",
  "7589": "Shall I also smite them dead?",
  "7590": "Bah, really?",
  "7591": "You dispute me?",
  "7592": "May I ask what led to this change?",
  "7593": "Why not a fortnight from now?",
  "7594": "What means this shouting in the house?",
  "7595": "And shall disaffection only be rewarded with security?",
  "7596": "Where else will one find a more happy union of magnificence and comfort, where better arrangements to facilitate commerce?",
  "7597": "May I ask why that date?",
  "7598": "Did you get him?",
  "7599": "Is conduct everything?",
  "7600": "You have, then, a repugnance to your profession?",
  "7601": "What could be the matter?",
  "7602": "Where is the doctor?",

  "7619": "How then shall I take away these opinions?",
  "7620": "You are hurt?",
  "7621": "Any occasion to show my papers?",
  "7622": "What are you laughing at, husband?",
  "7623": "And what could he say to her?",
  "7624": "What does it matter to me?",
  "7625": "But surely you would not wish to offend the bishop?",
  "7626": "Can this be my whole purpose?",
  "7627": "What did she know of this strange creature at her side?",
  "7628": "Pyramids?",
  "7629": "What is ther to do, now?",
  "7630": "How did you begin?",
  "7631": "When I heard her dismiss the footman, I stepped up to him and asked him, what little lady that was?",
  "7632": "You may ask, by what authority do I venture, being a person not concerned in the practice of medicine, to meddle with that subject?",
  "7633": "And what do you wonder?",
  "7634": "So I's to gouge out all their eyes, eh?",
  "7635": "What was it about?",
  "7636": "And the hyperbola?",
  "7637": "And in what city did you live?",
  "7638": "Are you not ashamed to speak to a wretch lying on the stones?",
  "7639": "Can I do anything for you?",
  "7640": "Yet how many people have I hated in my life?",
  "7641": "Will you take a chair?",
  "7642": "And straightway hereupon, arose the natural question of cui bono?",
  "7643": "Could that girl have been playing off any of her coquettish tricks?",
  "7644": "What was I to say?",
  "7645": "Where are you damn'd?",
  "7646": "Do you care to pursue further?",
  "7647": "You take me?",
  "7648": "What could I do but follow him?",
  "7649": "So why was she surprised?",
  "7650": "Will they be here long?",
  "7651": "What means this violence in my house?",
  "7652": "You are quite aware of that?",
  "7653": "There is to be no doubt about that, is there?",
  "7654": "What mean you?",
  "7655": "The first question is, whether a government, proposing to itself the propagation of religious truth as one of its principal ends, is more likely to lead the people right than to lead them wrong?",
  "7656": "And what if they were friends, brethren, countrymen?",
  "7657": "Have we not thieves enow among us already?",
  "7658": "Shall I ring for them to carry you down?",
  "7659": "Is it a blaspheming clause or reserve any way scandalous unto the world?",

  "7685": "Now, maiden, before this wedding continues, whom will you have to husband?",
  "7686": "Why that word virtuous, said he, I pray you?",
  "7687": "What was it you did say to the archbishop?",
  "7688": "Is that letter for me?",
  "7689": "To set off to see her again?",
  "7690": "Ought I to be angry with her for being faithful to him?",
  "7691": "And the waiters, yea, and the inns at which they waited, and the cold rounds of beef inside, and the stunted ostler, with his blue nose and clinking pail, where is he, and where is his generation?",
  "7692": "Will not the reasons which indicate the propriety of this arrangement strongly plead for an admission of the other branch of that body to a share of the inquiry?",
  "7693": "Before I close may I say a few words upon two topics, much discussed out of doors, upon which it is highly important that our judgment should be clear, definite, and steadfast?",

  "7772": "But what is the truth?",
  "7773": "You give me the lie and will not draw your sword?",
  "7774": "And where do you live?",
  "7775": "Had she given up to heaven the pure soul of an old maid, the calm soul of a spouse, the tender one of a mother, or one moved by love?",

  "9164": "If an irresistible power, stronger than his own will, were to quell his courage, what would happen?",
  "9165": "With whom?",
  "9166": "What bids me to abandon hope of ease?",

  "9210": "Would eighteenpence be?",
  "9211": "And yet, on the other hand, if they were going to make the venture, the sooner they did it the better, for were they not paying rent all the time, and living in a most horrible way besides?",
  "9212": "And which is the factory?",
  "9213": "Never do what?",
  "9214": "So you have a hole in your stomach?",
  "9215": "Will any one go with me?",
  "9216": "It is a duel, then?",
  "9217": "How are you now, dear?",
  "9218": "And in what light did you view the occurrence?",

  "9222": "And things are NOT too utterly far gone with them?",
  "9223": "You have lost as usual?",
  "9224": "My little rosy child of old?",
  "9225": "What do you think about the weather?",
  "9226": "You loved him, anyway, before you were allowed to speak?",

  "9230": "What was it then?",
  "9231": "To talk about?",
  "9232": "Enough, you say?",
  "9233": "Do you believe in the influence of the moon upon distempers?",
  "9234": "But how did you come to be in my house, and me not know it?",
  "9235": "When the world believe the worst of the poor?",
  "9236": "Would he have been less gay or less happy in the smiles of your sister?",
  "9237": "What sort of stuff do you think I'm made of?",
  "9238": "Was he perfectly virtuous?",
  "9239": "What are you making there?",
  "9240": "And when are you off?",
  "9241": "What a pox ails the fellow?",
  "9242": "But oh, how deliciously cool were the darkness and the stairs?",
  "9243": "And shall that be the premiss of our argument?",
  "9244": "Is it by such disobedience you prove your love for us?",

  "9248": "Form a company for the stealing of diamond necklaces?",
  "9249": "A stranger?",
  "9250": "Heart, can any man walk more upright than he does?",
  "9251": "Is not the hearing suspended?",
  "9252": "A high, perpendicular face of ice, up which we should have to haul our things laboriously with the help of tackles?",
  "9253": "Said I not all seams and dents but one?",
  "9254": "Had your dinner, I suppose?",
  "9255": "And why should I describe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel?",
  "9256": "And is it not summed up in these four words?",
  "9257": "But if we even could suppose a distinction of interest between the opulent landholder and the middling farmer, what reason is there to conclude, that the first would stand a better chance of being deputed to the national legislature than the last?",
  "9258": "Then, if women are to have the same duties as men, they must have the same nurture and education?",
  "9259": "What adventure?",
  "9260": "Undo me behind, will you?",
  "9261": "Well, have you been attacking the new order of things?",
  "9262": "Then this is an inn?",
  "9263": "And the note is in it?",
  "9264": "Why have they not done so?",
  "9265": "No one who could hear, and might, by possibility, understand?",
  "9266": "What think you?",
  "9267": "Is it by the police?",
  "9268": "Do you think my confession singular, or is it the fact of my being engaged to your son?",
  "9269": "Is that too much to ask, lording?",
  "9270": "Was it?",
  "9271": "Where is that region?",
  "9272": "Do you still love him?",
  "9273": "Then it was for some duel?",
  "9274": "Have you done?",
  "9275": "And what was the quest of which he spoke?",
  "9276": "You, is it?",
  "9277": "What makes you stamp and fidget so?",
  "9278": "Lost your purse?",
  "9279": "What wicked tricks are these?",
  "9280": "What difference can it make whether he is a duke or a groom so long as he is intelligent and good?",

  "9292": "Would you believe that now?",
  "9293": "Was anything impossible to a power that had done all this?",
  "9294": "To have his passport visaed?",
  "9295": "Why not announce thyself openly, and cast me off at once?",
  "9296": "Whom are you going to cook?",

  "9298": "What can she want with you now?",
  "9299": "Where do my twelve daughters dance at night?",
  "9300": "Noticed anything peculiar about the room?",
  "9301": "Which?",
  "9302": "Clever people, eh?",
  "9303": "It is not the kind of business a man can live upon, is it?",
  "9304": "Now how is that precise moment to be described?",
  "9305": "How's your mamma this afternoon?",
  "9306": "What has the count done?",
  "9307": "Thuran is with you?",
  "9308": "But what did we want arms for?",
  "9309": "What sized man is he?",
  "9310": "But have we still far to go to the northward?",
  "9311": "Hurrah?",
  "9312": "What companion, my dear boy?",
  "9313": "What folly will not a pair of bright eyes make pardonable?",
  "9314": "Did it not seem as if the settlers were laying the first stone of some edifice?",
  "9315": "Does the example even of the war now going on tend to justify that conclusion?",
  "9316": "And leave the treasure?",
  "9317": "But, when a lady descends to marry a groom, is not the groom her head, being her husband?",
  "9318": "Do you see?",
  "9319": "Was it an explosion of gas?",
  "9320": "Of course you know the legend of the fiend dog which haunts the family?",
  "9321": "Do you see this passing whirlwind called SOCIETY, from which burst forth, with startling brilliancy, lightnings, thunders, and voices?",
  "9322": "You have never spoken?",
  "9323": "What is to become of me?",
  "9324": "And why is he blarzy, miss?",
  "9325": "And, then, also, why make a man unhappy by telling him what he does not know?",
  "9326": "What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here?",
  "9327": "An order, sire?",
  "9328": "To whom did this anarchical scoffer unite himself in this phalanx of absolute minds?",
  "9329": "And how may we account for it?",
  "9330": "What fascination is it that can take you back, and make you cling to wickedness and misery?",
  "9331": "Where can you take him to?",
  "9332": "And must I tell you, my lord what they wished us to cry as well?",
  "9333": "And would be sorry to part with them?",
  "9334": "I need not ask, I suppose, whether you found the journey pleasant this time?",
  "9335": "Was there no one by?",
  "9336": "Were they daughters of the family?",
  "9337": "How was that possible?",
  "9338": "Would you think there were any thing in him?",
  "9339": "Do you know what we were talking about when you came in?",
  "9340": "Why do you distill into the heart of the man you term your friend all the bitterness that infects your own?",
  "9341": "Was she annoyed, too, about something?",
  "9342": "What giants?",
  "9343": "For whose?",
  "9344": "What could this paper contain?",
  "9345": "Name?",
  "9346": "Shall I preach you a sermon?",

  "9351": "So what was the use of his courting rheumatism by waiting in this morgue of dead agricultural ambitions?",
  "9352": "What is their unanimous declaration?",
  "9353": "And the concert?",
  "9354": "After all, you have done your best for your country, and I have done my best for mine, and what could be more natural?",
  "9355": "How I loved him?",
  "9356": "Do you want to sink the ship, by knocking off at a time like this?",
  "9357": "What was there in the world now for which it was worth his while to live?",
  "9358": "You mean we can leave at once?",
  "9359": "May I venture to submit my arm to him?",
  "9360": "Now, uncle, what do they call that there?",
  "9361": "May he not be less willing by a firm conduct, to make personal enemies, when he acts under the impression that a time is fast approaching, on the arrival of which he not only MAY, but MUST, be exposed to their resentments, upon an equal, perhaps upon an inferior, footing?",
  "9362": "And how long do they generally last?",
  "9363": "What do you say to this?",
  "9364": "And it will not cut?",
  "9365": "Will you go so high up as that?",
  "9366": "Is my visage astray?",
  "9367": "And where is the messenger?",
  "9368": "Why not use the rafters overhead, call them boxes, and charge two francs for a seat on them?",

  "9371": "Who shall furnish him with a new basis for his special science?",
  "9372": "Can it be so?",
  "9373": "Are you so sure of it?",
  "9374": "But why should this man pretend to be his own brother?",
  "9375": "Tambourine playing?",
  "9376": "How comes she in such society?",
  "9377": "What's settled, then?",
  "9378": "Well, but where can he fly to?",
  "9379": "Well, what am I going to do?",
  "9380": "Does he know anything?",
  "9381": "And you think you can find the place again where it was buried?",
  "9382": "Have you been paid?",
  "9383": "An important public character arising in that hemisphere, shall I be told that its influence will not be felt at home?",

  "9385": "Shall you see the king again?",
  "9386": "I am to remain on this gaudy platforna on which my miserable deception has been so long acted, and it is to fall beneath me when you give the signal?",
  "9387": "It will take you a day to mend this wheel?",
  "9388": "The nature of the soil?",
  "9389": "Besides, what is easier?",
  "9390": "And there, in the bright moonlight, what did they see?",

  "9395": "What call you your nephew, signior?",
  "9396": "How can you possibly justify yourself?",
  "9397": "You here?",
  "9398": "What do you want a month?",
  "9399": "So close?",
  "9400": "Would he oblige me?",
  "9401": "Might, sister?",
  "9402": "I knew her character well?",

  "9411": "Did she swim?",
  "9412": "Officer, what's his name?",
  "9413": "Are you sure so much pampering is really good for the men's characters?",

  "9415": "Cui bono?",
  "9416": "And what supply is preparing for it, my lords?",
  "9417": "Worse?",
  "9418": "And what is his story?",
  "9419": "Or was it a test of my strength of affection, that I should institute no inquiries upon this point?",

  "9429": "Can an INSTANTANEOUS cube exist?",
  "9430": "I tell you that marriage is a thing necessary in order that society should exist, but it is not in the nature of our race, do you understand?",
  "9431": "But how did I explain existence?",
  "9432": "We say that we are against arbitrary rule and despotism, and is this not the most awful despotism?",
  "9433": "Has your excellency found our defense so feeble as to believe the measure necessary?",
  "9434": "For why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do?",
  "9435": "You did not take to pieces all the chairs?",
  "9436": "Is it you, my child?",
  "9437": "And if these things were done in the green tree, what would have been done in the dry?",
  "9438": "What shall I do to you?",
  "9439": "What is the use of trying to make things worse?",

  "9445": "Where does he live?",
  "9446": "Were there a dozen claimants?",
  "9447": "What staff of life?",
  "9448": "Can you be?",
  "9449": "Why, then, are you armed?",
  "9450": "Is longest life worth aught?",
  "9451": "But did you find nothing worth taking which escaped the other gentlemen of the road?",
  "9452": "What difference does it make to me?",
  "9453": "Whither go you now with him?",
  "9454": "Was it you calling me?",
  "9455": "What step did I take upon this occasion?",
  "9456": "What has become of him, then?",
  "9457": "And if he was so bad then as that comes to, how is he such an angel now?",

  "9476": "Cora, what think you?",
  "9477": "What dance of death was this?",
  "9478": "Does it matter me seeing them?",
  "9479": "Well, doctor?",
  "9480": "Was not that enough in the case of the competitions?",
  "9481": "Then what is to be done, monsieur?",

  "9507": "Shortly?",
  "9508": "And you last saw him at eight o'clock last night?",
  "9509": "What was it altogether?",
  "9510": "Is not this a desperate state of things?",
  "9511": "Spartan?",
  "9512": "That is to say, you wish to lean on my arm, and yet to walk your own way?",
  "9513": "What is the basis of them all?",
  "9514": "So, sir, and what follows?",

  "9529": "What do you mean by the rest of the time?",
  "9530": "You would meet the queen, and she would not know who you are?",
  "9531": "May I sit down for a minute?",

  "9547": "But what sort of way?",
  "9548": "And uncle knows?",
  "9549": "I wonder what she's like?",
  "9550": "Whose pain can have been like mine?",
  "9551": "With what, then, has humanity to reproach my brother?",
  "9552": "And your honour, doubtless, wad consider the time and trouble?",

  "9558": "Was it true that this curtain did move?",
  "9559": "It is now what?",
  "9560": "But, do you hear?",
  "9561": "Whittington, perhaps?",
  "9562": "What are they?",
  "9563": "Also to be soothed, and gently and reverently entreated when angry, even more than a father, and either to be persuaded, or if not persuaded, to be obeyed?",
  "9564": "Who's there?",
  "9565": "All loose?",
  "9566": "A great honour for me, is it not?",
  "9567": "Will you now be so good as to tell me with whom I have the honor of conversing so pleasantly, instead of being in the ambulance with that maniac's bullet in my body?",
  "9568": "What was the use of any anathema when he would only take it away, as a dog does a bone, and enjoy it in a solitary corner?",
  "9569": "Not the way to get on in life, you'll tell me?",
  "9570": "What resolution did he take?",
  "9571": "Whither have they gone, then?",
  "9572": "Surely it is not because she is so very anxious to find a husband?",
  "9573": "Do you know me, sir?",
  "9574": "How do you like them?",
  "9575": "How long shall I myself spend my blood drop by drop?",
  "9576": "Has she been wearing any of the emeralds, by the way?",
  "9577": "But what made you choose this place?",
  "9578": "Why should he not do the magnificent thing?",
  "9579": "What has it found?",
  "9580": "And what is there that can better deserve to be preserved?",
  "9581": "And you have a letter?",
  "9582": "And what do they teach you?",
  "9583": "And the fleet?",
  "9584": "Then how prove that we will as we do, because of the equivalence of the pleasure to the pain?",
  "9585": "You had better have a slice of ham or an egg, or something with your tea?",
  "9586": "Have you not heard?",
  "9587": "Would it be all right to telephone down to the office, or do you think it would be better to ring?",
  "9588": "But the bicycle?",
  "9589": "Could it be done?",
  "9590": "Had the man succeeded in making his escape?",
  "9591": "Can one drink to the sun's health, do you think, prince?",
  "9592": "Will you not cease to lend an ear to those orators of mysticism who tell you to pray and to wait, preaching salvation now through religion, now through power, and whose vehement and sonorous words captivate you?",
  "9593": "Monk?",
  "9594": "Can you be more kind in your daily life?",
  "9595": "Why should I hazard what I have?",
  "9596": "Did you see my daughter?",
  "9597": "The soldiers' baseness, or the general's fault?",
  "9598": "Whither?",
  "9599": "You see?",
  "9600": "Did you read yesterday's telegrams?",
  "9601": "What does he want with me?",
  "9602": "And you stood and looked on?",
  "9603": "Is there anything you would like?",
  "9604": "News?",
  "9605": "And how many have you in charge?",
  "9606": "I say, what's the matter with you?",
  "9607": "And, to avoid censure, what sacrifices are not made by weak minds?",
  "9608": "Well, what am I to do?",
  "9609": "Where is the money?",
  "9610": "Have you brought your wife?",
  "9611": "Vain?",
  "9612": "What shadows the brooks?",
  "9613": "Like husbandry for the acquisition of corn?",
  "9614": "Has he some secret sorrow that I cannot share?",
  "9615": "What have we shown so far?",
  "9616": "What had occasioned this precipitate departure?",
  "9617": "What made you go at all?",
  "9618": "She lets you off?",
  "9619": "And to what can it so naturally change as to affections or emotions, which are suitable to the temper, and agree with that set of passions, which then prevail?",
  "9620": "Well, did you like their horses?",
  "9621": "Do you know to whom you speak?",
  "9622": "Why is she not out with her brother?",
  "9623": "You have your liberty?",
  "9624": "But are we floating?",
  "9625": "How disentangle the passion for equality from the passion of cupidity, when begins the fight for equality of possessions?",
  "9626": "Do you know what time he will be home?",
  "9627": "A human skull?",
  "9628": "From that time forth, was it chance?",
  "9629": "And does why this seductive planet, more poetic than the sun, that seems destined, so discreet is it, to illuminate things too delicate and mysterious for the light of day, make the darkness so transparent?",
  "9630": "Are you serious, mother?",
  "9631": "What will you say to him now?",
  "9632": "What did she call me?",
  "9633": "What's the use of recalling what's past?",
  "9634": "How does he stand?",
  "9635": "Have you any objection to meet any persons who may be with madame, or do you desire to preserve a strict incognito?",
  "9636": "Or is it given to him?",
  "9637": "What other reason could he have?",
  "9638": "What about him?",
  "9639": "Oh, you're there, are you?",
  "9640": "Have you been ill?",
  "9641": "And surely you have known a city ere now that has marshalled her battalions against a rival state, but with defeat she changes suddenly and is willing to obey and not resist?",
  "9642": "For heaven's sake, where is that?",
  "9643": "How did you leave the count?",
  "9644": "And what did she answer, madame?",
  "9645": "Should we not do better in the grottos?",
  "9646": "What is the matter now, my bold equestrian?",
  "9647": "What will my husband say?",
  "9648": "How can there be?",
  "9649": "Up the river?",
  "9650": "From whom may the letter be you bear to his eminence?",
  "9651": "More than ten pounds?",
  "9652": "To what extent, at this time, was she really a victim?",
  "9653": "What is he here for?",
  "9654": "Lachenel?",
  "9655": "Have you not seen him?",
  "9656": "And so you pick me up in your round, eh?",
  "9657": "What should I be afraid of?",
  "9658": "Where, where, he asked himself, was it all to end?",
  "9659": "Do you not see that you are sliding down a declivity, and that you are obliged to grasp at something similar to the existing law?",
  "9660": "Did she go last night?",
  "9661": "What CAN be done about her?",
  "9662": "Is there anything else you want, good man?",
  "9663": "What view do you take of it?",
  "9664": "And what is knowledge, and among whom is it found?",
  "9665": "Half a crown?",
  "9666": "Did this arise from scorn or from respect?",
  "9667": "Would you mind giving me a little something?",
  "9668": "Who is our friend, my dear friend?",
  "9669": "What does he do that for?",
  "9670": "For what time shall I order dinner?",
  "9671": "Yes, but beer?",
  "9672": "You remember, miss, that we passed some conversation on a certain man this morning?",
  "9673": "What was that?",
  "9674": "Why have you stayed away so long?",
  "9675": "Under her direct appeal for the truth?",
  "9676": "Did you hit your man?",
  "9677": "Is it not time to awake from the deceitful dream of a golden age, and to adopt as a practical maxim for the direction of our political conduct that we, as well as the other inhabitants of the globe, are yet remote from the happy empire of perfect wisdom and perfect virtue?",
  "9678": "Says his father is buried there, eh?",
  "9679": "She has had what she wanted from the house?",
  "9680": "It is a conspiracy, then?",
  "9681": "You would not have recognized me?",
  "9682": "What conclusion do you draw from it?",
  "9683": "Is there a little boy here?",
  "9684": "How could we know when you would return?",
  "9685": "But what further do they couple with these demands which they make for congressional legislation?",
  "9686": "Has he been drinking?",
  "9687": "Did you see what he went after?",
  "9688": "Shillings perhaps?",
  "9689": "How did it begin?",
  "9690": "Did you quarrel with him?",
  "9691": "And you loved her?",
  "9692": "Where are you going so fast?",
  "9693": "What do you think better?",
  "9694": "What availed him then his strength and his prowess?",
  "9695": "But surely he has been destroyed?",
  "9696": "Does the gentleman always have books like that under his arm?",
  "9697": "Was he seen to come out?",
  "9698": "Is your excellency really in earnest?",
  "9699": "And what did she say to that?",
  "9700": "To whom can I speak it now?",
  "9701": "Who owes it you?",
  "9702": "What will the poor authors do in the presence of this omnipotent union of booksellers?",
  "9703": "But you said when we were getting up this morning that you had something you wished to tell me before I left?",
  "9704": "Did you fancy yourself dying?",
  "9705": "Aramis become your surety?",
  "9706": "Does he say so?",
  "9707": "What do you think will happen?",
  "9708": "What impression has my evidence made upon you?",
  "9709": "At what time will it be ready?",
  "9710": "And how do you come to be in our province?",
  "9711": "Where is that friend or enemy now?",
  "9712": "Do you support him for that purpose?",
  "9713": "Will you wait till you love no longer?",
  "9714": "How could I bring him?",
  "9715": "Are you all right?",
  "9716": "What new trouble has come?",
  "9717": "Peekish!?",
  "9718": "Would you wish a little more hot water, ma'am, or is there anything else that I could fetch you?",
  "9719": "And if care was not taken in the breeding, your dogs and birds would greatly deteriorate?",
  "9720": "Are coals to be relied upon?",
  "9721": "What are your rates?",
  "9722": "But when?",
  "9723": "What have we seen in our own personal walks through life to make us believe that women are devils?",
  "9724": "Is that mere guesswork?",
  "9725": "Who then is YOUR neighbour?",
  "9726": "But my horse, madame?",
  "9727": "Did you happen to meet any soldiers, my dear, as you came through the wood?",
  "9728": "Has he been wounded, then?",
  "9729": "D'you mean to say that you could take me back after all that's happened?",
  "9730": "Whatever is this?",
  "9731": "And begging your pardon, mister, what name will we call you, for we'd like to know?",
  "9732": "Do not they know where the shoe pinches?",
  "9733": "But will he listen to me?",
  "9734": "What did you RECKON he wanted with it?",
  "9735": "But your own vessel, monsieur?",
  "9736": "Do you think he is old?",
  "9737": "And it's going on?",
  "9738": "Now spose you make me an offer?",
  "9739": "How can the continued overflowings of a susceptible heart suffer it to be incessantly employed in so many little cares relative to the person?",
  "9740": "Vholes?",
  "9741": "There has not been any change made about your own arrangements?",
  "9742": "Do you question it, when you will make me proud and happy above all others of your court?",
  "9743": "Was that lure of men even now in the house, completing her evil work?",
  "9744": "Can he be right?",
  "9745": "What was he like?",
  "9746": "What was the subject, madam?",
  "9747": "But are our missionaries capable?",
  "9748": "Where does he eat?",
  "9749": "What right have you to ask?",
  "9750": "Who was this new, radiant being who had won to existence out of the mist and darkness of our fears?",
  "9751": "I wonder where that ship comes from?",
  "9752": "What gentleman is this?",
  "9753": "Just lend me your scarf, will you?",
  "9754": "But what can they intend to do with the poor creature, and how shall I ever meet her again?",
  "9755": "Says the coroner, is that boy here?",
  "9756": "No kidding?",
  "9757": "Will yo tak' a message to him?",
  "9758": "If there be no life, the same as the animal's life in the vegetables, how could animals sustain their lives feeding on vegetables?",
  "9759": "Do you think there will be?",
  "9760": "But you've had enough now?",
  "9761": "Things fo' me?",
  "9762": "And you would wish me to advance some money?",
  "9763": "Now what is there in her?",
  "9764": "Does it follow that the preferences of love and friendship are unjust?",
  "9765": "But then, where could it be?",
  "9766": "Oh, you mean a change?",
  "9767": "Did you see a man in the pit?",
  "9768": "Do you think they'll object?",
  "9769": "Then there is nothing impossible or out of the order of nature in our finding a guardian who has a similar combination of qualities?",
  "9770": "Will you come back to me?",
  "9771": "And I think a glass of wine will not be disagreeable to you?",
  "9772": "What's that, a dog?",
  "9773": "How did you know I was in service?",
  "9774": "So you can stay here and trifle around with some one else?",
  "9775": "What could I do with myself?",
  "9776": "Then the just is like the wise and good, and the unjust like the evil and ignorant?",
  "9777": "Who can he be?",
  "9778": "And the silver?",
  "9779": "How can we possibly be anything else?",
  "9780": "You have a theory?",
  "9781": "Will not the post be better?",
  "9782": "And do you think now that she could undertake a voyage of some extent?",
  "9783": "Do you suppose I should contend against the most valiant sword in the kingdom?",
  "9784": "A lesson?",
  "9785": "Justified yourself, have you?",
  "9786": "And when they have been enriched, what more shall be done?",
  "9787": "Assault, riot, theft, what do you call these?",
  "9788": "What is a LEGISLATIVE power, but a power of making LAWS?",
  "9789": "And how is the book entitled?",
  "9790": "What was all the trouble about?",
  "9791": "With those studs?",
  "9792": "Have you lost your heart?",
  "9793": "What did he do?",
  "9794": "If you could live in a star, which one would you pick?",
  "9795": "But would he?",
  "9796": "What makes you think it 'ud be against his will?",
  "9797": "For heaven's sake what have you done?",
  "9798": "Who, after such brilliant examples of our annihilating justice, who dare accuse us of forbearance?",
  "9799": "How explain, how find out her wishes?",
  "9800": "What then remained for me to do?",
  "9801": "You refer to the possible hindrances from want of health?",
  "9802": "What other hardier pioneer would come, hatchet in hand, to cut down the dark copses?",
  "9803": "Ever been kicked?",
  "9804": "Well, how do YOU explain it?",
  "9805": "And to what penalty do you think the king will be condemned?",
  "9806": "Why was my heart so faint?",
  "9807": "How has that contest gone?",
  "9808": "Then you did not see either of them?",
  "9809": "Then why are you leaving?",
  "9810": "On what occasion would it be most probable that such a presentation would be made?",
  "9811": "Il est mort?",
  "9812": "Then why does he follow you so with his eyes, and get you so frequently alone with him, and keep you so continually at his side?",
  "9813": "Perhaps you have some special information?",
  "9814": "Then how in the name of all that is wonderful did you get these facts?",
  "9815": "And is not this enough to prove that the establishment of equal toleration was not his plan?",
  "9816": "What is the sun?",
  "9817": "Had he a hat?",
  "9818": "After all, the question is still where?",
  "9819": "Did he not tell you?",
  "9820": "Do you live in this room always?",
  "9821": "But what happened to you?",
  "9822": "Where do the sailor live?",
  "9823": "Are we happy because we are good, or are we good because we are happy?",
  "9824": "How, pray?",
  "9825": "Your letters?",
  "9826": "Or in love with the professor's wife?",
  "9827": "How can you hope to reform her after the life she has led?",
  "9828": "For what reason?",
  "9829": "What can be the matter?",
  "9830": "What mystery was this?",
  "9831": "How, in a month?",
  "9832": "You did not let the executioner escape, then?",

  "9839": "Have you a sister?",
  "9840": "Is the general going to dismiss me?",
  "9841": "Why will you not let yourself be guided by those who are older and wiser than you?",
  "9842": "Have you chosen a post in which you might be of service to your neighbor?",
  "9843": "Is this house all yours, or joint property?",
  "9844": "Shall I be damned?",
  "9845": "What can have happened to him?",
  "9846": "In this prison that I am going to so unjustly, shall I have some free communication with the world outside?",
  "9847": "What could he reply when asked wherefore, and with what motive, he had been found alone in the night, armed with a sword, in the thickest of the wood?",
  "9848": "Is it not just, however, that they should have their reward, on account of these?",
  "9849": "What sort of cloth is it?",
  "9850": "How does the mortal world go?",
  "9851": "What are you going to say?",
  "9852": "But you can sleep when you please, monsieur?",
  "9853": "Will you be quiet?",
  "9854": "But what extraordinary tumult do I hear?",
  "9855": "But what did you say?",
  "9856": "Doctor, am I not to go with you?",
  "9857": "These volcanoes, however, were at one time in a state of activity?",
  "9858": "Disturbed her?",
  "9859": "Why do you attribute to me a wish for anything that would annoy you?",
  "9860": "She's got no money, you mean?",
  "9861": "Could something have happened out there to keep her away?",
  "9862": "Who'll look after you on this ship?",
  "9863": "The cargo on board?",
  "9864": "Why will they leave us some regret?",
  "9865": "Ah, your favourites are among these?",
  "9866": "Why, did not I tell you she had been stolen from me?",
  "9867": "When, oh when, would his new clothes be ready?",
  "9868": "Say when shall it be?",
  "9869": "Would it be to promote emancipation?",
  "9870": "Or is it the death of some dear friend that has disturbed his mind?",
  "9871": "Why is it that we see no therns?",
  "9872": "Call you that hope, your highness?",
  "9873": "What fault do you find with her?",
  "9874": "Why was his brow clammy with drops of moisture, his knees shaking beneath him, and his soul oppressed with a cold gloom?",
  "9875": "Why is she wandering alone through these mountains?",
  "9876": "If we reject it now, is there any human probability that we shall ever see again so propitious a set of circumstances to bring about the same results?",
  "9877": "Was it indeed a house of death to which I had come, too late?",
  "9878": "Where is that?",
  "9879": "And those who govern ought not to be lovers of the task?",
  "9880": "Why should a man like you go about telling lies in this way?",
  "9881": "And if he could not resist ME, do you think his daughter could resist HIM?",
  "9882": "Do with him?",
  "9883": "Why could he not remember the name when he was told the first time?",
  "9884": "Vortex?",
  "9885": "What am I to believe?",
  "9886": "Glad?",
  "9887": "But what the deuce did they DO?",
  "9888": "And it's not such a very bad house, is it?",
  "9889": "Do you wish to sleep with us?",
  "9890": "Sperrit?",
  "9891": "Why were those eyes so sunken?",
  "9892": "What kind of a legist is he who declaims when he ought to reason, who continually mistakes his metaphors for legal axioms, and who does not so much as know how to obtain a universal by induction, and form a category?",
  "9893": "Well, what should I say to the king?",
  "9894": "Is there immediate danger?",
  "9895": "Eyes of an admirable expression?",
  "9896": "But how do you make it out?",
  "9897": "Jack?",
  "9898": "And she?",
  "9899": "How did he get the money to buy this house, allow me to ask?",
  "9900": "Do you always draw like that?",
  "9901": "Why attempt to describe the terrible scene which ensued?",
  "9902": "Why, it is seven o'clock?",
  "9903": "You'll promise me you will do this for me?",
  "9904": "How many years have passed since then?",
  "9905": "Because she's so handsome?",

  "9910": "Did you never hear talk of a young woman who was carried off one night?",
  "9911": "Should he climb the other ridge, or wander along the hollow?",
  "9912": "You do not mean that they have sent him to prison?",
  "9913": "How did he manage to buy this house?",
  "9914": "Was it a knell for his lost soul, chasing him through the empty streets and beginning already an eternal punishment of terror?",
  "9915": "What was he doing during that time?",
  "9916": "What is to be settled?",
  "9917": "Do you mean of dislike?",
  "9918": "If that is not a horror, what is?",
  "9919": "Who knows but this may be deemed right below?",
  "9920": "The sentiment is strong, then?",
  "9921": "Is your soul alive?",
  "9922": "Wildeve?",
  "9923": "And so you would explode confirmation and marriage altogether?",
  "9924": "You think I may hope?",
  "9925": "Do you know the young man?",
  "9926": "What means he, sir?",
  "9927": "Who set you the tasks?",

  "9931": "What good?",
  "9932": "Will that ever be?",
  "9933": "Can we get it right away?",
  "9934": "Do you think so, sir?",
  "9935": "Know the road at all?",
  "9936": "Will they not sign it?",
  "9937": "My husband?",
  "9938": "What's this about the girl you say is leaving?",
  "9939": "And the wager?",
  "9940": "Can you guess what it is?",
  "9941": "How say you now?",
  "9942": "Morrel, can you intend it in my house, under my very eyes?",
  "9943": "Why should he have got into any argument about the validity of these orders?",
  "9944": "What have you done to the man?",
  "9945": "Do you notice how it exalts everything?",
  "9946": "Think it?",
  "9947": "What good is it?",
  "9948": "Is it you?",
  "9949": "You approve of my going away for years, then, and never coming here again till I have made myself of some mark in the world?",
  "9950": "In this emergency what are the contending parties doing?",
  "9951": "Must they devour each other?",
  "9952": "What do you say, mother?",
  "9953": "Is it wrong to watch the kingfisher seeking his nest?",
  "9954": "Where are you going to now?",
  "9955": "We're on the right track, I think?",
  "9956": "Is he, indeed?",
  "9957": "You would not inform?",
  "9958": "There is such a person, then?",
  "9959": "Who in this universe?",
  "9960": "Or who would with any patience hear his friends, if they should presume to defend his government as not arbitrary and tyrannical?",
  "9961": "Once more, he said, what ruler is there of the elements of human nature other than the soul, and especially the wise soul?",
  "9962": "Then why not be more careful than him?",
  "9963": "You esteem her, sir?",
  "9964": "You are going to verify THAT?",
  "9965": "And yet?",
  "9966": "Get my letter?",

  "10387": "What was to be done after the crowning of the king?",
  "10388": "Have you not got enough corn of your own?",
  "10389": "We might ask, why it should be a greater proof of insanity in men to set a high value on rare tulips than on rare stones, which are neither more useful nor more beautiful?",
  "10390": "Is it your pleasure, most dear father, that you speak?",
  "10391": "And what will you do about it?",
  "10392": "The girl's name?",
  "10393": "And what have they promised?",

  "10426": "The meaning, monsieur?",
  "10427": "You really advise it?",
  "10428": "Then we will let it take its chance?",
  "10429": "You are aware it will be war, civil war, furious, devouring, implacable?",
  "10430": "What respect then can be paid to that which describes nothing, and which means nothing?",
  "10431": "And then what?",

  "10459": "Now, did the dogs act thus from the experience of each individual, or from the example of the older and wiser dogs, or from an inherited habit, that is from instinct?",
  "10460": "And a choice of what?",
  "10461": "Are you all right here?",
  "10462": "But what were these fatigues, what did the wounds matter?",
  "10463": "My business?",
  "10464": "What else do you hear?",
  "10465": "Not worth speaking of?",

  "10474": "Then what is it for?",
  "10475": "As to the autonomy of the village communities, what could be retained of it after so many blows?",
  "10476": "A fear of what?",
  "10477": "You know that there is another man then?",
  "10478": "Is she still in town?",
  "10479": "Do you think that I would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death?",

  "10491": "What is the good of such rules?",
  "10492": "Or had you rather forfeit your kingdom, your treasures, and your life?",
  "10493": "How are you going to manage that, captain?",
  "10494": "Did she stand the journey well?",
  "10495": "What's it to be?",
  "10496": "What business had she to go away?",
  "10497": "Why poor?",
  "10498": "But it had not approached the body?",
  "10499": "Where did you place it?",
  "10500": "Before the trial?",
  "10501": "My lord, you loue her?",
  "10502": "And what would you do in return?",
  "10503": "Ah, but madame, does mankind ever lose anything?",
  "10504": "Not heard of him, perhaps?",
  "10505": "Why do you come here to do this?",
  "10506": "The king's room?",
  "10507": "Am I a servant?",
  "10508": "Where's the clothes you run off in, you ungrateful robber?",
  "10509": "What do we do next?",
  "10510": "Had this mysterious being, whatever he was, whose existence could not be denied, abandoned the island?",
  "10511": "What will become of me then?",
  "10512": "He has confessed it to you yourself?",

  "10518": "Is there no such thing as a gentleman?",
  "10519": "What is your name, boy?",
  "10520": "But, sir, are you sure he is as guilty as they say?",
  "10521": "From where does she hail?",
  "10522": "Further, I said, has not a drunken man also the spirit of a tyrant?",
  "10523": "Why do you, a stranger coming into my rooms at this time of the night, ask that question?",
  "10524": "What did they want from him?",
  "10525": "Who shall still appoint what shall be discoursed, what presumed, and no further?",

  "10527": "And you believe her promise?",
  "10528": "Who?",
  "10529": "Tell me, now, if persistence is not a virtue?",
  "10530": "What, it may be asked, is the true spirit of the institution itself?",
  "10531": "Is this a theatre?",
  "10532": "You set me at defiance, do you?",

  "10541": "Can they be coming at me?",
  "10542": "Snow at this time?",
  "10543": "What, can he steal, that you demand so much?",
  "10544": "If it was so, was she not bound to show her this letter?",

  "10552": "Did you get very wet?",
  "10553": "Did she see him often?",
  "10554": "Do you particularly like the man?",
  "10555": "Look?",
  "10556": "Is he asleep?",
  "10557": "And if each is one, and both are two, she will conceive the two as in a state of division, for if there were undivided they could only be conceived of as one?",
  "10558": "What could they do, did she think?",
  "10559": "Can I help you now?",
  "10560": "How do they live?",
  "10561": "This beast, I rather conclude, friend, is not of home raising, but is from foreign lands, or perhaps from the little island itself over the blue water?",
  "10562": "Do they hop?",
  "10563": "What's wrong with me?",
  "10564": "Would it not then have been the same if he had died of a fever or of the small pox, of old age, or of anything else?",
  "10565": "In order not to involve the social wealth in an unlimited and consequently disastrous solidarity, will they content themselves with imposing rules upon the spirit of invention and enterprise?",
  "10566": "Is not that a perfect and lofty love?",
  "10567": "But was she here when the lady came?",
  "10568": "Do I talk nonsense if I wish to recover my money?",
  "10569": "Are these plains composed of arid sand, as the first astronomer maintained?",
  "10570": "Alive and well?",
  "10571": "You have some plan, then?",
  "10572": "How could he answer to such an appeal?",
  "10573": "Do you think the poison he fell a victim to was intended for him?",
  "10574": "Shall we get on with our work?",
  "10575": "Mean to say he knowed nothing of you?",

  "10578": "Would you be good enough to turn your face to the window?",
  "10579": "And why had I these aspirations and these regrets?",
  "10580": "So you have a lodging?",
  "10581": "Go away with you?",
  "10582": "This is not your writing?",
  "10583": "For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?",
  "10584": "Who told me to love her?",
  "10585": "And is that all you can say for him?",
  "10586": "Do you think it would be worth a week's wages?",
  "10587": "When is the time?",
  "10588": "What is this, my dear?",
  "10589": "What if I were to try such and such a thing?",
  "10590": "Do you think the countess would mind my having or two of them here if I were to ask her?",
  "10591": "How can she conceal the intrigue from other people's eyes?",
  "10592": "And the persons whose property is taken from them are compelled to defend themselves before the people as they best can?",
  "10593": "Do they, when they put to flight, as it is said, disorders that have baffled the powers of medicine, work in conformity to the light of reason?",
  "10594": "Have you the keys to those two doors?",
  "10595": "You understand that, I hope?",
  "10596": "Who is happy?",
  "10597": "And, if natural, may it not be assumed to be proper and right?",
  "10598": "Who talks of dying?",
  "10599": "Can they be saved when the army has gone?",
  "10600": "Can it harm my lover for me to live on after he is dead, if I take no pleasure in anything but in the woe I bear for him?",
  "10601": "Will you only say that you have been mistaken, and that I may depend on your not acting secretly in future?",
  "10602": "Was it for this, however, that his visits to the farm formed a delightful exception to the meagre occupations of his life?",
  "10603": "An instance?",
  "10604": "But will you go with me to gain the pardons?",
  "10605": "Will you stand upon your legs, you young devil?",
  "10606": "Did she object to it?",
  "10607": "And if her ships are not to be admitted into our harbours, I would ask, how is she to protect us?",
  "10608": "May I hope it?",
  "10609": "Must you really go now?",
  "10610": "And the more detestable his actions are to the citizens the more satellites and the greater devotion in them will he require?",
  "10611": "I suppose it could be managed somehow?",
  "10612": "Have you made him any promise that I must ratify?",
  "10613": "Am I not interrupting your conversation?",
  "10614": "Have you no fears lest your conduct should be misinterpreted?",
  "10615": "The big cake or the little deadlies?",
  "10616": "Will you swear to sacrifice even your lives in their defense, and to keep them always by your valor in the path to victory?",
  "10617": "Anything moving in the old place, mid I ask?",
  "10618": "Are you going to leave me?",
  "10619": "Surely you are mistaken about his trade?",
  "10620": "Can this be it?",
  "10621": "Lemonade, sir?",
  "10622": "Have I not shown my power?",
  "10623": "And how can she do so if, up to this minute, by your own statement, she is herself in ignorance of your knowledge?",
  "10624": "What do we know of the beauty they replace?",
  "10625": "Am I still superintendent?",
  "10626": "Why, what is there so terrific in the cavern?",
  "10627": "Then where did papa get it?",
  "10628": "Then, it is your opinion that our friend has perished in the waves?",
  "10629": "Do you really forgive me?",
  "10630": "What do I say?",
  "10631": "Did I frighten you so much?",
  "10632": "Are you here before me?",
  "10633": "But ought we to attempt to construct one?",
  "10634": "And she knows nothing of it?",
  "10635": "Have you seen a ooser?",
  "10636": "How do you know that?",
  "10637": "What, are you ready there?",
  "10638": "What do you want with her, boy?",
  "10639": "You know the hunt and chase?",
  "10640": "You at last?",
  "10641": "On your word, now?",
  "10642": "But, it will be asked, what kind of a treasure is this that we propose to bequeath to posterity?",
  "10643": "How do you get at that?",
  "10644": "Frank?",
  "10645": "Are you strong enough?",
  "10646": "Now, I want to hear you swear that you are not married to that woman?",
  "10647": "But what, then, is the noise?",
  "10648": "How did you conceive that idea?",
  "10649": "Now, do it look like it?",
  "10650": "Where can they be?",
  "10651": "Was he considering what pallet, what brushes, what canvas he must use, to introduce them into visible life through his art?",
  "10652": "Can you spare me a very few minutes?",
  "10653": "Has the sly old fox made his fortune then, and gone to live in a tranquil cot in a pleasant spot with a distant view of the changing sea?",
  "10654": "What man would marry a girl so placed?",
  "10655": "To what end?",
  "10656": "Do you know?",
  "10657": "Or is it by the law courts and the judge?",
  "10658": "Whom had we to deal with?",
  "10659": "And yet there was one thing wanting in order to complete your happiness?",
  "10660": "I hope there's nothing wrong?",
  "10661": "Have the private emotions also their gutter press?",
  "10662": "Yes, but how came you here again?",
  "10663": "Do you think there is a single person in the county who will not know that his doing is a sign that he has quarrelled with me?",
  "10664": "Are your doubts on that point too strong?",
  "10665": "Who you gwine to take to jail now?",
  "10666": "You, my lord?",
  "10667": "But who could help loving her?",
  "10668": "How so, if he love her?",
  "10669": "Was there anything unusual about the bodies?",
  "10670": "Would you be so good as tell us?",
  "10671": "Now, is it possible to reconstruct the series from which money seems to have been detached, and, consequently, restore the latter to its true principle?",
  "10672": "Have you been studying much law lately?",
  "10673": "You told her that?",
  "10674": "And is it your cook who prepares these pills?",
  "10675": "Or do I have to hit you again?",
  "10676": "What are you giggling at?",
  "10677": "Does anybody believe it?",
  "10678": "Is it wrong to watch the moon, the stars?",
  "10679": "Does anyone know him by sight?",
  "10680": "Would she part with privileges which, once relinquished, could never be regained?",

  "10683": "You'll know our light porter again?",
  "10684": "Is it a good road?",
  "10685": "Am I to let the troops have the oats, and to take a receipt for them?",
  "10686": "Had he in his turn succumbed?",
  "10687": "Anna, what is it for, why will you?",

  "10689": "You remember what people say when they are sick?",
  "10690": "Do you often have this housewarming?",
  "10691": "There are forty years of work in me yet, and why should you despair?",
  "10692": "A tree?",
  "10693": "Are we going to tell him still that politics is a disreputable and useless form of human activity?",
  "10694": "Would you like some nice little part with the infant?",
  "10695": "And is it not needed whenever it helps us and hurts the enemy?",
  "10696": "If you put a question to a person in a right way, he will give a true answer of himself, but how could he do this unless there were knowledge and right reason already in him?",
  "10697": "Was he here this morning?",
  "10698": "Have you posts of profitable pecuniary emolument?",
  "10699": "How could such a state of things be kept secret?",
  "10700": "And do you still deem it a part of valor to die?",
  "10701": "But not about all?",
  "10702": "But is this really true, as you say it now?",
  "10703": "Had you any idea of his coming so soon?",
  "10704": "Did I not forbid you to show your face here for month?",
  "10705": "And am I not to learn his name?",
  "10706": "But what did it matter?",
  "10707": "So that now?",
  "10708": "Has she softened or hardened?",
  "10709": "We shall follow one or the other of these curves?",
  "10710": "How many other girls did you ever tell that?",
  "10711": "Will you hear me say but one word?",
  "10712": "Whether it was a criminal act that I had committed?",
  "10713": "Your head is cool?",
  "10714": "Was it, sir?",
  "10715": "Verver?",
  "10716": "What's that he said?",
  "10717": "Shall they be admitted?",
  "10718": "Why did you quarrel?",
  "10719": "Have you been a soldier?",
  "10720": "Is not this an insult, pray?",
  "10721": "I believe it was you, unless I have had the bad luck to mistake the person in following?",
  "10722": "What can they have meant by this howling?",
  "10723": "Where was he before?",
  "10724": "He had no other calling?",
  "10725": "What character did I act?",
  "10726": "What sort of man are you?",
  "10727": "Helen, are you mad?",
  "10728": "What will be my fate?",
  "10729": "Ah, then you at length understand?",
  "10730": "I call it time, but how long was it?",
  "10731": "Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place?",
  "10732": "What the deuce?",
  "10733": "What, my friend?",
  "10734": "I hope there's nothing amiss?",
  "10735": "Well, WHAT did I tell you?",
  "10736": "Do this look like a forge?",
  "10737": "To how much does the loss amount?",
  "10738": "Combat by regulations the degrading influence of parcellaire division?",
  "10739": "How's everything with you?",
  "10740": "CAN one have knowledge only of the past?",

  "12539": "Where do you come from, then?",
  "12540": "What is my queen musing over?",
  "12541": "I should recant?",
  "12542": "Meanwhile, have you anything more to tell us about the case?",
  "12543": "Because the thing had been such a scare?",
  "12544": "There is no clue?",
  "12545": "Did you notice how dreadfully ill he's looking?",
  "12546": "Is my granddaughter here?",
  "12547": "If this be true would you like to have the shells sent to you?",

  "12558": "If, in truth, a certain mass had been broken off from the terrestrial sphere, whither would it wend its way?",
  "12559": "How can we be implicated in any way?",
  "12560": "Did she go to the police?",
  "12561": "Was not that an exceedingly singular thing?",
  "12562": "Are we going to move any faster than this?",
  "12563": "And what was he to do?",
  "12564": "What fer?",
  "12565": "Well, what do you mean to say, then?",
  "12566": "And what then do you propose to give us?",
  "12567": "Have you never had the curiosity, when you have landed and found this island deserted, to seek for this enchanted palace?",
  "12568": "Shall I go to the train with you?",
  "12569": "Did he, oh did he, begin his wooing?",
  "12570": "Why hesitate?",
  "12571": "What do you mean to do with that purse?",
  "12572": "Well, and what do you think, dear friends?",
  "12573": "Can I come in?",
  "12574": "Why are you here?",
  "12575": "Well, and is there not an opposite of life, as sleep is the opposite of waking?",
  "12576": "The population still rose, but what was the quality of the men born?",
  "12577": "Have you never observed how invincible and unconquerable is spirit and how the presence of it makes the soul of any creature to be absolutely fearless and indomitable?",

  "12586": "Butter?",
  "12587": "Are not the tendencies plain?",
  "12588": "Wherefore not?",
  "12589": "Tell me, eh, is it possible?",
  "12590": "How can you possibly tell?",
  "12591": "Then the idea of this marriage really grieves you too?",
  "12592": "Else how could all this have happened?",
  "12593": "Who are you, fellow?",
  "12594": "Then you ought to know how to make grimaces?",
  "12595": "CAN I be careful?",
  "12596": "I do think he must have been sent for about money matters, for what else can it be?",
  "12597": "Does he not say she must be given to the swallows?",
  "12598": "How could he have foreseen this terrible heat, or the fact that they would start so late in the day and in such crowds?",
  "12599": "Or should I give up a work which my conscience tells me is a good one, because I regret the loss of his society?",
  "12600": "Well, would you like a steep and swift descent?",
  "12601": "Where was I, sir?",
  "12602": "Why should she marry?",
  "12603": "But if that is so, what is there to live for?",
  "12604": "Is he so unnatural, say you?",
  "12605": "Now, tell us, what interest do you expect?",
  "12606": "Did I know I should accompany you?",
  "12607": "You are going into the garden?",
  "12608": "Henchard?",
  "12609": "You wanted the lord, did you?",

  "12612": "Again, is it not the agriculturist who fattens, for our clothes, his abundant flocks in the pastures?",
  "12613": "Why should one live?",
  "12614": "Do you see those four windows?",
  "12615": "Would he not at once have freed them?",
  "12616": "The question is, what did the archbishop find?",
  "12617": "In case of disaster, would not a retreat be more difficult by your plan than mine?",
  "12618": "Why did the conductor run along the footboard, why are they shrieking, those young men in that train?",
  "12619": "You did attempt it?",
  "12620": "Love you?",
  "12621": "Who?",
  "12622": "How do they drink?",

  "12634": "You grant that?",
  "12635": "Oh, my lungs and liver, what do you want?",
  "12636": "But is the analogy a real one?",
  "12637": "Have I any need to tell you so?",
  "12638": "Now he is gone, are you come to see how unhappy I am?",
  "12639": "What do they do to him?",
  "12640": "Nothing to add?",
  "12641": "How dare you pry, and peer, and stare at me, sirrah?",
  "12642": "Who can have given earth the wisdom and power to produce corn?",
  "12643": "And have you been good to him?",
  "12644": "What still remains to be thrown out?",
  "12645": "Curiosity?",
  "12646": "Had I known how could I have given them to him?",
  "12647": "And you have done nothing in favor of our love?",
  "12648": "What, again, is the meaning of light and heavy, if that which is light is also heavy, and that which is heavy, light?",
  "12649": "What on earth are you crying for now?",
  "12650": "Then why does that chattering magpie tell such lies to a woman?",
  "12651": "But you yourself were the person who suggested that?",
  "12652": "Perhaps you can account also for the bullet which has so obviously struck the edge of the window?",
  "12653": "But you will after a while, and then what will become of me?",
  "12654": "And where are my books?",
  "12655": "Could we better?",
  "12656": "What's come to you?",
  "12657": "If you were mad, do you think I should hate you?",
  "12658": "Do you know where he proposes to go?",
  "12659": "But what chance is there of success?",
  "12660": "Of what did these lovers talk then?",
  "12661": "Well, what?",
  "12662": "And how is our patient?",
  "12663": "Was there any chance of escaping from the fury of this impetuous torrent, and of returning to the surface of the globe?",
  "12664": "Then what have you to say of me?",
  "12665": "What, still keeping up this silly jest?",
  "12666": "Shall we take our valets?",
  "12667": "Let us discuss it like honest people, like friends, and then forget what has passed between us, shall we?",
  "12668": "And where have you just come from?",
  "12669": "And why has she, or any other, curled hair?",

  "12673": "How thrive you with this second wife of yours?",
  "12674": "Why has this been sent to my house?",
  "12675": "Would you like to kiss me?",
  "12676": "Would I find out that boy that had fed him and kep his secret, and give him them two one pound notes?",
  "12677": "What atmospheric disturbance was the cause of them?",
  "12678": "Astonish us?",
  "12679": "What's property?",
  "12680": "Besides, what good has it ever done when I have set my face against them?",
  "12681": "Have you a light?",
  "12682": "And what meaning is that in their solemn depth?",
  "12683": "Why do you stand gaping there?",
  "12684": "Was it a wire or a mathematical line?",
  "12685": "Where are you off to so early?",
  "12686": "Are you going far in this condition?",
  "12687": "From hence how far?",
  "12688": "It's a possible thing?",
  "12689": "What is it a sign of when your shade's like a coffin, neighbours?",
  "12690": "Would any single measure be so effective in removing all plausible grounds for these intrusions as the graduation of price already suggested?",
  "12691": "And do you reflect that guilt upon me which should lie buried in your bosom?",
  "12692": "Would you also regret having me for your cousin?",
  "12693": "Would you like to become rich, or at least independent?",
  "12694": "Not the moon?",
  "12695": "Like a drink?",
  "12696": "When did you see him?",
  "12697": "And now let us see, young man, with your hand upon your conscience, how did all this come to pass?",

  "13489": "Can it be done?",
  "13490": "Is she your child?",
  "13491": "What if by endeavouring to place her in the position of a lady, he had falsely so placed her, and robbed her of her legitimate position?",

  "13514": "How will that do?",
  "13515": "But why shall I say more?",
  "13516": "I wonder if you will forgive me?",
  "13517": "But with what object?",

  "13524": "There are no villages here?",
  "13525": "What at?",
  "13526": "Something that you would like done, is it not?",
  "13527": "Was that all?",
  "13528": "Will you not let me look at it also?",
  "13529": "And are things in order?",
  "13530": "How about the fireplace?",
  "13531": "Why, what is the matter?",

  "13542": "Or hear, except with the ear?",
  "13543": "What is the wind?",
  "13544": "What must I answer?",
  "13545": "Is there any talk yet of who is to run?",
  "13546": "Must it be so?",

  "13549": "And does not marriage mean motherhood?",
  "13550": "Hand over, will you?",
  "13551": "And think there was to you no conscience of the housebreaker, what would you do?",
  "13552": "What is it that you will not do?",
  "13553": "And whither go we, my father?",
  "13554": "What vault?",
  "13555": "By asking advice instead of exerting the judgment?",
  "13556": "The question naturally arises, how is it that in these latter cases the winter plumage of both sexes, and in the former cases the plumage of the adult females, as well as the immature plumage of the young, have not been at all affected?",

  "13569": "How can you reconcile it to your conscience, I wonder, to prejudice my own boy against me, or against anybody who is dear to me?",
  "13570": "Nor of any other such person?",
  "13571": "Will your excellency deign to open it?",

  "13595": "Do you think he had planned this robbery, when he went with you to the lodging?",
  "13596": "O, is your bundle ready?",
  "13597": "It was a cunning device, for, apart from the chance of driving your victim to his death, what peasant would venture to inquire too closely into such a creature should he get sight of it, as many have done, upon the moor?",

  "13608": "What advice?",
  "13609": "Who told her?",
  "13610": "Remarkable for what?",

  "13633": "Why did he so?",
  "13634": "What was it, my own mother?",
  "13635": "But when you held her in your power, why did you not drown her, strangle her, hang her?",
  "13636": "But by whom will Z be paid for the loss caused him by the profit charged by A in the beginning?",
  "13637": "Do you think I'd let him imagine for a minute that anything he said could influence me in my public duty?",

  "14640": "And if he is compelled to look straight at the light, will he not have a pain in his eyes which will make him turn away to take and take in the objects of vision which he can see, and which he will conceive to be in reality clearer than the things which are now being shown to him?",
  "14641": "And how did you live then?",
  "14642": "Is there anything more dreadful than talking to one's self in an empty house?",
  "14643": "I that loved and you that liked, shall we begin to wrangle?",
  "14644": "That's your kind, is it?",
  "14645": "Are you really conscious, love, of what you're saying?",
  "14646": "And how has it all happened?",
  "14647": "Then we shall want merchants?",
  "14648": "Were not his disposition, mind, character, acquirements, all such as women most delight to love?",
  "14649": "And how could you believe he was my lover?",
  "14650": "Having settled then that he was to tell a lie, what lie should he tell?",
  "14651": "But how can you be sure that the path you show is the true path?",
  "14652": "For when a man knows not his own first principle, and when the conclusion and intermediate steps are also constructed out of he knows not what, how can he imagine that such a fabric of convention can ever become science?",
  "14653": "Could we even tell what might occur during the march?",
  "14654": "Then we must abstain from spoiling the dead or hindering their burial?",
  "14655": "But who could he have been?",
  "14656": "Must you know all?",
  "14657": "Bertuccio?",
  "14658": "But, at any rate, is the water deep enough?",
  "14659": "Who has not seen how women bully women?",
  "14660": "What else is there?",
  "14661": "Besides, the pass itself permits her to bring necessary baggage, and is not a baby six months old necessary baggage?",
  "14662": "Eyes like what?",
  "14663": "Is it that he loves him less than when he lavished on him the tenderest caresses?",
  "14664": "How long ago is that?",
  "14665": "His own money?",
  "14666": "Was that the stuff?",
  "14667": "Why must SHE be scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold?",
  "14668": "Whatever have you done, darling?",
  "14669": "If I am a prisoner, what crime have I committed?",
  "14670": "And if she was ugly, what question more awkward both to put and to answer?",
  "14671": "If they did not want it why did they not merely throw it into the water?",
  "14672": "While the rain descends so, must I lay my head on the cold, drenched ground?",
  "14673": "Do you think he disliked her seeing him at our house?",
  "14674": "What was left of the little world he had grown up in, and whose standards had bent and bound him?",
  "14675": "Rather than wait, to make sure?",
  "14676": "Is it not possible to take a step further towards recognizing and organizing the rights of man?",
  "14677": "How came this mad fellow to break loose?",
  "14678": "Would he only speak in favour of the address?",
  "14679": "Is he living?",
  "14680": "Could she refuse sometimes to answer that beseeching look which she felt to be following her like a low murmur of love and pain?",
  "14681": "But his brain?",
  "14682": "Why else should he have shewn such unwillingness to accept your invitation here?",
  "14683": "And her name?",
  "14684": "Or would the men, as broader men, merely have to revise some of their moral judgments?",
  "14685": "But none of you would go?",
  "14686": "And yet you have spoken to her?",
  "14687": "Got here safe, did you?",
  "14688": "Have you no comforts?",
  "14689": "One of your friends?",
  "14690": "But who is he?",
  "14691": "What do you suppose, my friend, and how ought I to answer them?",
  "14692": "A steam machine?",
  "14693": "What should they decide?",
  "14694": "You had the first prize for geography, my boy?",
  "14695": "Why had he sentenced her to death?",
  "14696": "What are you doing in my home?",
  "14697": "Will he get it now, I wonder, and in what form?",
  "14698": "What's the fete?",
  "14699": "If I disappear, what happens?",
  "14700": "Names down on the papers?",
  "14701": "And now that each is trying to break the contract, in what do they differ?",
  "14702": "Now, are not the best husbandmen those who are most devoted to husbandry?",
  "14703": "What did it matter to him?",
  "14704": "You have been watching us from behind that bush?",
  "14705": "Besides, would the princess have me?",
  "14706": "Is it a tinker you are?",
  "14707": "And why in lilac precisely?",
  "14708": "Before we go, do you mind if I look in your pocket?",
  "14709": "Can we do away with the special claims of family, of neighborhood, of the state?",
  "14710": "What was it, sir?",
  "14711": "Caxton?",
  "14712": "Is she gone?",
  "14713": "Had she wronged him with her fears for the future?",
  "14714": "In what does our security consist against usurpation from that quarter?",
  "14715": "In such a situation what is the mandate of science?",
  "14716": "Just get out of my way, will you?",
  "14717": "But who directed you thither?",
  "14718": "How can it possibly be permitted?",
  "14719": "Do you suppose I eat like an ogre or a ghoul, that you dread being the companion of my repast?",
  "14720": "Who can see so far?",
  "14721": "What's the moon to a man like me?",
  "14722": "Assingham?",
  "14723": "Shall we refer to them again?",
  "14724": "Why do you call me princess?",
  "14725": "Have we got everything?",
  "14726": "Why doubt what you cannot but know?",
  "14727": "Whatever did that girl mean by saying she took it and lost it?",
  "14728": "If I had forgiven it, ought he to have spoken?",
  "14729": "Should we distrust the man because his manners are not our manners, and that his skin is dark?",
  "14730": "Or was I right?",
  "14731": "How should I?",
  "14732": "How are you, anyhow?",
  "14733": "Do you understand me?",
  "14734": "Was he the man that stabbed you?",
  "14735": "You were sent by some other person?",
  "14736": "Who are you, then?",
  "14737": "Is it all there?",
  "14738": "Where did you find her?",
  "14739": "What is that in your hand?",
  "14740": "Am I vain if I say, now after the lapse of so many years, that in my mind her intellect felt companionship?",
  "14741": "Did your excellency desire to see me?",
  "14742": "But where can man go?",
  "14743": "Does not that sight take a tooth out of the cannibal's jaw?",
  "14744": "Are there many such?",
  "14745": "Is it, then, a bonfire just kindled?",
  "14746": "Is not pity the cross on which he is nailed who loveth man?",
  "14747": "You followed her?",
  "14748": "Shall we have champagne?",
  "14749": "Half a million, is it?",
  "14750": "Tell me, then, madame, why have you been so harsh these three or four months past?",
  "14751": "Who told you all you know about me?",
  "14752": "And of the objects which are being carried in like manner they would only see the shadows?",
  "14753": "Brother?",
  "14754": "You like my cigar, eh?",
  "14755": "Booty?",
  "14756": "And who was the father to be so obeyed?",
  "14757": "At any rate, I suppose you mean to go home with me now?",
  "14758": "Have you made up your mind?",
  "14759": "What have you to do with politeness, I should like to know?",
  "14760": "What the devil are you doing here, count?",
  "14761": "Well, so you've not gone away yet?",
  "14762": "To me, in private?",
  "14763": "Who the deuce asked you to talk about my affairs?",
  "14764": "Have I spoken unspeakable things?",
  "14765": "What noise, what coile is that you keepe?",
  "14766": "Whoever heard of such a thing, talking away?",
  "14767": "Calm?",
  "14768": "And on the morning of the wedding?",
  "14769": "Do you forget that the needs of the morrow must be high, not to speak of the outlay for the day?",
  "14770": "Was it possible he had done these things?",
  "14771": "Is what you tell me true?",
  "14772": "And is there a large force of you here?",
  "14773": "But, perhaps, you have disposed of the coachman as well as the horses?",
  "14774": "For come, where is it?",
  "14775": "The horse?",
  "14776": "With hands and feet?",
  "14777": "Where does the right of spoliation begin, and where does it end?",
  "14778": "And are we going to insult the man when he comes over here on a friendly visit?",
  "14779": "Where's my pouch?",
  "14780": "And what are you going to be some day?",
  "14781": "What is she thinking of?",
  "14782": "Have they not been written in other chronicles?",
  "14783": "What use is there in gathering more?",
  "14784": "But what right have you to keep me here?",
  "14785": "What words are these?",
  "14786": "Why, what would any one ask more than that?",
  "14787": "Why were they fools?",
  "14788": "What did he suspect you of?",
  "14789": "Who are these gentleman?",
  "14790": "How knew he the man?",
  "14791": "You are my paid subordinate, are you?",
  "14792": "I must ask what it is you want of me?",
  "14793": "But to whom do I speak?",
  "14794": "We going to have a little music?",
  "14795": "But he received it on that day?",
  "14796": "Do you really and truly say so?",
  "14797": "Why should you take any step till the trial be over?",
  "14798": "Do you remember the window breaking?",
  "14799": "Perhaps you think you have invented a novelty?",
  "14800": "Would you know, my lord and husband, who this dying woman was?",
  "14801": "Your excellencies permit it?",
  "14802": "And then, are all uprisings calamities?",
  "14803": "Why they die of sunstroke, you mean?",
  "14804": "And, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for the summer?",
  "14805": "It seems so easily settled, does it not?",
  "14806": "What do you kiss for?",
  "14807": "And two women?",
  "14808": "I mean, how much money would satisfy them so that you need not be troubled any more?",
  "14809": "Yes, for why?",
  "14810": "What's he doing down here?",
  "14811": "He impressed you in that way, did he?",
  "14812": "What have you been doing?",
  "14813": "But do you think even brothers have any right to exchange confidences of that sort?",
  "14814": "What'll we do with what little swag we've got left?",
  "14815": "But if this income be not justly mine, what if she and I have both to beg?",
  "14816": "You mean that the old days can never be brought back?",
  "14817": "Do you know his address?",
  "14818": "Is this all you have to say?",
  "14819": "Shall we prefer the virtuous on account of their abilities, if they are capable of governing the city?",
  "14820": "What will happen to him, poor child?",
  "14821": "You say so?",
  "14822": "Did he forgive her?",
  "14823": "How do you do?",
  "14824": "You understand that there's danger, boy?",
  "14825": "Is not he as near akin to you as the other?",
  "14826": "Pretty stiff in the back?",
  "14827": "At last one of them asked me what a gentlewoman was?",
  "14828": "How the devil came I by this?",
  "14829": "Only that?",
  "14830": "What shall I say to the cardinal?",
  "14831": "And wherefore say not I that I am old?",
  "14832": "There's nothing I can do for you?",

  "14838": "IS my day past, and is this indeed the coming on of night?",
  "14839": "What'll you take for her?",
  "14840": "Will you let me be your friend, and will you come to me for comfort if you need it?",
  "14841": "And what is the natural and proper measure of punishment?",

  "14854": "Has anybody been for me?",
  "14855": "Mother says, shall she come and have tea with you?",
  "14856": "One thing?",
  "14857": "Waiting?",
  "14858": "But can you tell me why I'm crying?",
  "14859": "Why, my sweet heart?",
  "14860": "Can we arm ourselves against our teachers and divinities?",
  "14861": "What am I to do with it, please?",
  "14862": "Has no one owned him?",
  "14863": "Now tell me, my gentle friend, who are those who now accuse you of treachery, and have confined you in this lonely place?",
  "14864": "What are the bells ringing for, I wonder?",
  "14865": "My sadness?",
  "14866": "Whom have we here?",
  "14867": "And where were there not others to be moved by him?",
  "14868": "Are they laying poison for you?",
  "14869": "You would tell me, then, that I know all?",

  "14894": "Is he very ill?",
  "14895": "Do you call yourself a mother, and not know that a mother's first duty is to blow her boy out?",
  "14896": "Or has she been asked to call the occupant of that house at a given hour?",
  "14897": "Sunday, monsieur?",
  "14898": "I wonder what new fad he has taken up now?",
  "14899": "Was there ever such avarice?",
  "14900": "You believe it?",
  "14901": "What was all the row about?",
  "14902": "Who pronounced these sentences?",
  "14903": "Why do we not preserve a like attitude towards political and philosophical questions?",

  "14945": "Does religion and virtue offer no stronger motives, no brighter reward?",
  "14946": "Well, dearest, and what was your answer?",
  "14947": "What was your exception, and to what passage in your personal observation of him did you refer?",
  "14948": "Is that any better?",
  "14949": "Why do you stare at me like that?",

  "15432": "Are you right now?",
  "15433": "Whither are you going?",
  "15434": "And how will it end?",
  "15435": "In short, what character, or peculiar turn of understanding, is more excellent than another?",
  "15436": "What harm can come thereof?",
  "15437": "And what's going to happen?",
  "15438": "Why are you weeping then?",
  "15439": "Was either group walled in hopelessly by sheer ignorance?",

  "15449": "Moreover, could he trust to the worship of which he saw himself the object?",
  "15450": "What awfulness, in heaven's name, is there between them?",
  "15451": "Have you a handcart in the house?",
  "15452": "Is there no other child?",
  "15453": "What say you, lady?",
  "15454": "You mean to take your horse?",
  "15455": "And a man was with you?",

  "15501": "Oh, there's more?",
  "15502": "You have, doubtless, already guessed that I was preparing a surprise for you?",
  "15503": "How could I become cruel or vicious, when I had before my eyes only examples of mildness, and was surrounded by some of the best people in the world?",

  "15513": "Did he call out because he landed in the water, do you think?",
  "15514": "What will you give me?",
  "15515": "Why do you not apply to them, if you stand in need of help?",
  "15516": "Have you the paper on you?",

  "15520": "And I put it as a question to those, who make a study of mankind, whether representation and election is not too great a power for one and the same body of men to possess?",
  "15521": "What have you been in with me for ages?",
  "15522": "And why was this blessed change?",
  "15523": "Or what amendment of your affairs will it bring you, if you do not now go out to meet them?",
  "15524": "And the general?",
  "15525": "Your three suits of apparel a year?",
  "15526": "What do you say, why not go after all?",
  "15527": "Unjust, say you, sister?",
  "15528": "And there you are, my partner, eh?",
  "15529": "Is that she, mamma?",
  "15530": "And you, count, have made this match?",
  "15531": "Have you the keys?",
  "15532": "What is to become of you?",
  "15533": "But have we great resources?",

  "15535": "Not even a reverend?",
  "15536": "I wonder if I've been changed in the night?",
  "15537": "Can you really then come if we start early?",
  "15538": "Do you wish to hear the name?",
  "15539": "Wickeder than usual?",
  "15540": "My dear fellow, what on earth is there in that?",
  "15541": "Love?",
  "15542": "Have I?",
  "15543": "What sort?",
  "15544": "How, sire?",
  "15545": "Can we describe in the same terms what is natural to man everywhere and always?",
  "15546": "The countess asked her if she found those words in the letter?",
  "15547": "Will you come?",
  "15548": "Who skinned you?",
  "15549": "Would you know why I'm thus, good people?",
  "15550": "But where, when, and how have they been arrested?",
  "15551": "And your duties here have drawn to an end, sir?",
  "15552": "How about him?",
  "15553": "But where are we to go?",
  "15554": "What limit would you propose?",
  "15555": "Any eggs?",
  "15556": "Why give rise to property, where there cannot possibly be any injury?",
  "15557": "Did I nurse you for this, that you should spare your blood on your father's enemies?",
  "15558": "But who resists it?",
  "15559": "You dance?",
  "15560": "Why then should you mind if men talk as you think they will?",
  "15561": "How, and when, and in what proportion shall aids of men and money be afforded?",
  "15562": "Tell me, sir, could you have the courage to do so?",
  "15563": "Oh, signora, how can you be so cruel?",
  "15564": "For who would believe my story?",
  "15565": "You'll be alone?",
  "15566": "But what CAN be done?",
  "15567": "Well, which shall go to left and which to right?",
  "15568": "May we not say that these desires spend, and that the others make money because they conduce to production?",
  "15569": "Why are you awake?",
  "15570": "How were they made?",
  "15571": "Do you really love me?",
  "15572": "You traverse the town and the streets in disguise?",
  "15573": "Do I bother you with talking about it?",
  "15574": "Who, then?",
  "15575": "Then, in general, those kinds of things which are in the service of the body have less of truth and essence than those which are in the service of the soul?",
  "15576": "But what is sovereignty?",
  "15577": "Now, what would you give him?",
  "15578": "Whaling not respectable?",
  "15579": "Too illiterate?",
  "15580": "Are you the same as we?",
  "15581": "What, have you made a passive bawd of me?",
  "15582": "Who's the man that says that we're all islands shouting lies to each other across seas of misunderstanding?",
  "15583": "Been under fire already?",
  "15584": "Who are they?",
  "15585": "But what is this I have heard about your intention of marrying her?",
  "15586": "How, indeed, shall I keep the crimson of my royal mantle always fresh and bright, unless I continually dye it anew in the blood of criminals?",
  "15587": "What has placed itself between us?",
  "15588": "How can one explain these physical sufferings and this morbid distress that were known for some time to his intimates alone?",
  "15589": "What sort of man is he?",
  "15590": "And you are sure that this is your husband's hand?",
  "15591": "Have I still a goal?",
  "15592": "Have they run?",
  "15593": "I think I am not mistaken?",
  "15594": "The facts are admitted?",
  "15595": "What do I care whether he is or not?",
  "15596": "Do you love him enough to wait till he can make a home for you, or will you keep yourself quite free for the present?",
  "15597": "Why do you trouble the man?",
  "15598": "Well, which is better?",
  "15599": "Will you come aboard?",
  "15600": "Is this possible?",
  "15601": "I ask myself, and I ask you, whether it is in our power, by any means, to avert the evil consequences that are only too likely to follow?",
  "15602": "May we say so, then?",
  "15603": "You are going away tomorrow?",
  "15604": "How are you all?",
  "15605": "And what brings you here, you jade?",
  "15606": "Could you pull a little stronger?",
  "15607": "About the dean?",
  "15608": "Do you think you've 'known' me?",
  "15609": "May I ask your name?",
  "15610": "But what's the use?",
  "15611": "Think I was going to stop on now I'm a gentleman of property?",
  "15612": "Why had she come out?",
  "15613": "For who would want to choose by rule?",
  "15614": "What do you say?",
  "15615": "After all, I'm not the first one to have a baby, am I?",
  "15616": "Not yet?",
  "15617": "Have you finished your repast, friend?",
  "15618": "But can we ever be in love with the former?",
  "15619": "Is it not strange compensation?",
  "15620": "Where did he go?",
  "15621": "For camping?",
  "15622": "Hall?",
  "15623": "Do you know what the result of that would be?",
  "15624": "Pray, what virtue do you attribute to a letter, which your speech might not possess?",
  "15625": "Can we fly, my friends?",
  "15626": "What should they fear?",
  "15627": "Was he about to learn at last who it was that he loved, who that young girl was?",
  "15628": "Some unique chaplet?",
  "15629": "Who is it that speaks?",
  "15630": "And where are you going?",
  "15631": "The one loves and embraces the subjects of knowledge, the other those of opinion?",
  "15632": "How can that ever be, father?",
  "15633": "Are you mad?",
  "15634": "Would there be any objection to my taking leave of any one I know, about here, before I go away?",
  "15635": "Why, where was you raised?",
  "15636": "Soon, sir?",
  "15637": "Had he hidden some of his magic tools underneath the floor?",
  "15638": "So late, is it?",
  "15639": "Would not the people start up in their seats, by a simultaneous impulse, and tear him down out of the pulpit which he defiled?",
  "15640": "Have you tried to drive a harpoon through a body?",
  "15641": "Did I perhaps learn from it the long clear silence?",
  "15642": "Have men, collectively, no whims, no prejudices?",
  "15643": "What did you pay for that meat?",
  "15644": "Or was it sensible?",
  "15645": "Well, what can I do for you this morning?",
  "15646": "You have money for them, for those loafers?",
  "15647": "Among those which grow lean which is that which grows leanest?",
  "15648": "Who's that grunting?",
  "15649": "What could we care about in the whole world beside, if we belonged to each other?",
  "15650": "To be in love is folly?",
  "15651": "Discarding punctilio and maxims adapted to more manageable times, and looking only to the unprecedentedly stern facts of our case, can you do better in any possible event?",
  "15652": "Had she not given all that she possessed?",
  "15653": "Shall we answer?",
  "15654": "Whose seats the weary traveller repose?",
  "15655": "What are we to do?",
  "15656": "It is really sold, then?",
  "15657": "What was the last word?",
  "15658": "Will you come with me if I win?",
  "15659": "Please, uncle, may I go on the river, then, if I'm not to go into the street?",
  "15660": "You probably know what I am going to tell you, or do you not?",
  "15661": "What do you mean by that?",
  "15662": "And you, monsieur, you were to obtain conditions for us, I think?",
  "15663": "Could you give me something to do for a few days?",
  "15664": "You like that style?",
  "15665": "D'you believe me?",
  "15666": "It was a troubled dream?",
  "15667": "Pain?",
  "15668": "Why do you want to know all this?",
  "15669": "Did I say we could depend upon no better man?",
  "15670": "And what did you reply?",
  "15671": "How can he make out that it is a forgery?",
  "15672": "Your old original one?",
  "15673": "Pray, what are you laughing at?",
  "15674": "For that matter, of what use could it be to me?",
  "15675": "I suppose you've come from there?",
  "15676": "Is it to be the last?",
  "15677": "Well, are we all ready to start now?",
  "15678": "O, fear you the constable?",
  "15679": "What ship's going?",
  "15680": "What had tempted her to imperil both of their lives?",
  "15681": "Who can exhaust the possibilities of their combination?",
  "15682": "How does it go?",
  "15683": "Why had she toyed with the threatening catastrophe?",
  "15684": "It's all right, eh?",
  "15685": "And the bricks?",
  "15686": "Which of them will nationalize the other?",
  "15687": "Your reverence, whither away so quickly?",
  "15688": "If so, where is it?",
  "15689": "Have they heard anything against her?",
  "15690": "Is she very clever?",
  "15691": "To turn you out for?",
  "15692": "Do you wish anything?",
  "15693": "Irritability?",
  "15694": "Have you ever been arrested before?",
  "15695": "Come up?",
  "15696": "Who lost the tails of his coat?",
  "15697": "Who banged the door?",
  "15698": "Did I steal?",
  "15699": "I ask again, is that the way to test the soundness of a doctrine?",
  "15700": "WHEN did he sing out?",
  "15701": "Now, what do you make of four times five?",
  "15702": "Have we not here a picture of his way of life?",
  "15703": "What is it made of?",
  "15704": "Did you strike golden guineas out of solder, young fellow, or shilling coins itself?",
  "15705": "How shall we get down?",
  "15706": "Does it take long to get a nose, now?",
  "15707": "Otherwise, what would become of society?",
  "15708": "Surely now they would find a document which would throw some light upon all the mysteries that had happened?",
  "15709": "To listen, say I?",
  "15710": "You say yes?",
  "15711": "Pray tell me how it happened?",
  "15712": "Now the question is, after what manner this utility and importance operate upon us?",
  "15713": "What makes you a coward?",
  "15714": "But, do you know?",
  "15715": "Can you dispute the boundary?",
  "15716": "And now tell me, I conjure you, has not imitation been shown by us to be concerned with that which is thrice removed from the truth?",
  "15717": "But what use can I make of it, if it lies in your cabinet?",
  "15718": "Are you going to try to go around it, and land on the side turned away from us?",
  "15719": "And pray what am I charged with?",
  "15720": "What matter?",
  "15721": "What would you do, tell me, if your sister listened to such a proposition?",
  "15722": "How is this to be accounted for?",
  "15723": "But where are you?",
  "15724": "Do you not recognize me, unhappy child?",
  "15725": "Does it not look as if an architect had planned it?",
  "15726": "I suppose you know what you have got?",
  "15727": "Do you know its name?",
  "15728": "Even after marriage?",
  "15729": "Who is it, I said, whom you are refusing to let off?",
  "15730": "But tell me how is my mother?",
  "15731": "You do not admit the conceivability at all?",
  "15732": "Is it only a piatak that I am worth?",
  "15733": "But who lighted it?",
  "15734": "Had you never noticed them before?",
  "15735": "How will we mark that passage?",
  "15736": "Do you not comprehend?",
  "15737": "You knew, then?",
  "15738": "Yes, sir?",
  "15739": "And what is your theory of this poor fellow's death?",
  "15740": "And the world empty of people?",
  "15741": "Flask?",
  "15742": "But the verb, the verb?",
  "15743": "How can he be so?",
  "15744": "Now, would anybody think that this room contained a happy, merry party, who desire nothing better than to laugh and dance the hours away?",
  "15745": "Then how do you know about his rooms?",
  "15746": "How long had it lain in the docks?",
  "15747": "A person to be trusted?",
  "15748": "How am I to be prudent?",
  "15749": "Oh, you are?",
  "15750": "What have you got in that bottle you are carrying?",
  "15751": "Who can have so great a claim on you as I have?",
  "15752": "Was it not less than thirty degrees?",
  "15753": "Never a word?",
  "15754": "What man could have resisted?",
  "15755": "Was anybody any better?",
  "15756": "What is it in the nature of the child that causes it so eagerly to eat and play?",
  "15757": "Why do you talk to me of combining together?",
  "15758": "Where shall I begin?",
  "15759": "How does all that fit into your theory?",
  "15760": "Are you glad to go?",
  "15761": "Who, then, can calculate the course of a molecule?",
  "15762": "What does it mean?",
  "15763": "When shall you send your invitations?",
  "15764": "Now, the question is, do you know him to be one man, or is he really a gang?",
  "15765": "Where does that wedding come from?",
  "15766": "Has he at last concluded?",
  "15767": "To what young lady?",
  "15768": "How could he be otherwise?",
  "15769": "But which one?",
  "15770": "Where's the husband?",
  "15771": "What nonsense is this?",
  "15772": "What benefits accrued to the conquerors from the three fires which annihilated so vast a portion of the buildings and riches of the city?",
  "15773": "Had it gone back to the motionless bed of water?",
  "15774": "Then shall we try to find some way of convincing him, if we can, that he is saying what is not true?",
  "15775": "Which do you admire, then?",
  "15776": "Have you seen anything of them?",
  "15777": "And you approve of such a union?",
  "15778": "Did you look at these papers on the table?",
  "15779": "After the performance?",
  "15780": "Is it fear or is it anger now?",
  "15781": "Do you wish me to say it has merit?",
  "15782": "For a paper?",
  "15783": "What is the purpose of our feeble crying in the awful silences of space?",
  "15784": "And do you remember the word of caution which preceded the discussion of them?",
  "15785": "How does he demonstrate it?",
  "15786": "What, you are going to leave us are you, too?",
  "15787": "Let me see, is this a chair?",
  "15788": "How old was she?",
  "15789": "Could your conversation have been overheard by any one?",
  "15790": "Do you think I'm a'goin' to?",
  "15791": "Why should one?",
  "15792": "Could I help her, do you think?",
  "15793": "And what shall I say to the people?",
  "15794": "Done to death?",
  "15795": "Why should I give you my goods for nothing?",
  "15796": "I beg your pardon?",
  "15797": "Is she honest?",
  "15798": "Enough?",
  "15799": "But, independently of that, what would they live on?",
  "15800": "What is leaving one's body?",
  "15801": "A first motion?",
  "15802": "Who are you that knock here?",
  "15803": "What sort of lie?",
  "15804": "What do you remember?",
  "15805": "Of what use is this tax?",
  "15806": "Else why should he go hunting these wild devils?",
  "15807": "Did anybody order you to prevent that woman from singing?",
  "15808": "It has vanished, has it not?",
  "15809": "And who is best able to do good to his friends and evil to his enemies in time of sickness?",
  "15810": "INFORMER I?",
  "15811": "Yea?",
  "15812": "Why do I believe in cause and effect?",
  "15813": "Who's she?",
  "15814": "Yet what business had I with hope?",
  "15815": "Is that how one human being should meet another?",
  "15816": "Richard, how is it with you?",
  "15817": "And how was that to be turned into cash when there was no cabin on it?",
  "15818": "You would?",
  "15819": "With orders for my medicines?",
  "15820": "Goin' home now, boys?",
  "15821": "Who will be good and save the old man?",
  "15822": "Or do you propose any other punishment that will be more useful to the public?",
  "15823": "What does the booby stare at?",
  "15824": "Have you finished?",

  "16229": "How is it that no one realizes this?",
  "16230": "That we do not wish to betray in every respect WHAT a spirit can free itself from, and WHERE perhaps it will then be driven?",

  "16270": "IRIS I?",
  "16271": "Do you hear that, madame?",
  "16272": "Should they hear from them?",
  "16273": "Is it not for nought?",
  "16274": "Oh, is it?",
  "16275": "It was only rheumatism, I suppose?",
  "16276": "Is that what dissatisfies you, monsieur?",

  "16295": "Shall the examination proceed?",
  "16296": "But who pulled the strings of that extraordinary puppet?",
  "16297": "Surely what belongs to me belongs no less to you?",
  "16298": "Two of them?",

  "16434": "Did he take no legal proceedings?",
  "16435": "And when?",
  "16436": "Are you engaged at anything in particular?",
  "16437": "What would have been his later steps?",
  "16438": "And his story of waiting day and night for her forgiveness?",
  "16439": "Will we all come together, or come apart?",
  "16440": "Where were their rich apartments, loaded with all that money could provide?",

  "16446": "What's this?",
  "16447": "Peaches?",
  "16448": "Is your curiosity satisfied?",
  "16449": "But what have I done?",
  "16450": "How is it that these should all be changed into a mineral concrete with which we have no acquaintance?",
  "16451": "Or any affinity to virtue in general?",
  "16452": "Ourselves?",
  "16453": "And eight?",
  "16454": "Did not groups, like sportive nymphs, throng around him, and begging him for some waltz of giddying rapidity, smile upon him with such wildering joyousness, as to put him immediately in unison with the gay spirit of the dance?",
  "16455": "And you must have got on an island, sure?",
  "16456": "What world is this?",
  "16457": "Could I do otherwise?",
  "16458": "Should the prisoners be set at liberty?",
  "16459": "Was it bad?",
  "16460": "Nothing to cut a feeling or sting a passion?",
  "16461": "As far as you could?",
  "16462": "But how are we going to arrange this?",
  "16463": "What was she short of now?",
  "16464": "What is the good of it?",
  "16465": "Does that offend you?",
  "16466": "Seeking what?",
  "16467": "Has anything been sent for from a chemist's that I have not examined?",
  "16468": "What is there astonishing in that?",
  "16469": "Is it as bad as that?",
  "16470": "How can a man conceal his character?",

  "16476": "Can you ride?",
  "16477": "Is it possible to dispirit the happy by telling them that happiness is unreal, or make the fortunate miserable by telling them that fortune has no objective reality, or to make one welcome evil by telling one that it is only the absence of good?",
  "16478": "Surely you have not remarked everything else in her, and only not THIS?",
  "16479": "What then is to be the result?",
  "16480": "You are sure of his feeling for you?",
  "16481": "Are you at home, sir?",

  "16484": "What are laws but expressions of the opinion of some class which has power over the rest of the community?",
  "16485": "You are not going?",
  "16486": "Or is it all only a dream?",
  "16487": "But how is your acquaintance to be long supported, under such extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse?",

  "19094": "I wonder why he has not come to tell me?",
  "19095": "What is he up to, anyway?",
  "19096": "Bourrienne, are we not old comrades?",

  "19122": "What surprises you in that?",
  "19123": "Ah, so you know that house too?",
  "19124": "When that bunch got interested and planned to float the company?",
  "19125": "For what is the memory but a faculty, by which we raise up the images of past perceptions?",
  "19126": "You'll put your horse in?",
  "19127": "Was there no other way?",
  "19128": "Then I have leave?",
  "19129": "Why have you disregarded my request?",
  "19130": "The blue room is it not?",
  "19131": "Ambition?",

  "19147": "And what prompted your heart, my fair sweet friend?",
  "19148": "What did all this matter to her?",
  "19149": "Do you know what he has done, this child?",
  "19150": "Well, why not, if you're not afraid?",

  "19220": "How have I?",
  "19221": "It's very ingenious, and she says several pretty things in the process, but what's gained, I'd like to know?",
  "19222": "But who else was there?",
  "19223": "Do I look a sight?",

  "19262": "Do you see this diamond?",
  "19263": "Why did he not go?",
  "19264": "Who was this man who held in his finger these curiously variegated links of an unknown chain?",
  "19265": "How much may not a few months do?",
  "19266": "What would this chamber of justice do?",
  "19267": "Well, yes, you are right, I am a fool, why not simply remain here?",
  "19268": "Are you going to shoot me?",
  "19269": "Oh, do you know that it is cruel never to name the name of the loved one?",
  "19270": "Is he quiet?",
  "19271": "A girl, is it?",
  "19272": "Shall a curiosity, which seems to lead nowhere, be satisfied?",
  "19273": "Was there no injustice in this?",
  "19274": "A dead dog, or rabbits, or what?",
  "19275": "Have you plotted to drown me?",
  "19276": "Oh, where was he?",
  "19277": "If I might make a suggestion, sir?",
  "19278": "What decision?",
  "19279": "Have you a mind to go ashore there?",
  "19280": "From number sixty?",
  "19281": "Or was the projectile nothing now but a metal coffin, bearing three corpses into space?",
  "19282": "What is the difficulty?",
  "19283": "How could you shut me out, bear it all alone?",
  "19284": "Would it be an indiscretion to ask to see those precious pills?",
  "19285": "And who is the cause of all this annoyance?",
  "19286": "After this, what more can be wanted?",
  "19287": "Tame?",
  "19288": "Will you take these mementos to him?",
  "19289": "And WHERE has he gone?",
  "19290": "But what is the point of it?",
  "19291": "Might it not be possible that the cheque having thus fallen into her husband's hands, he had come, after a while, to think that it had been sent to him by his friend, the dean?",
  "19292": "And what good is it to the bubble while it holds together, or what harm when it is burst?",
  "19293": "What are you going to do with yourselves after you get settled?",
  "19294": "Is that it, my dear?",
  "19295": "If one is not to get into a rage sometimes, what is the good of being friends?",

  "19302": "WHICH one is the poet?",
  "19303": "What if her nerve had given way under the strain?",
  "19304": "What are you up to, little man?",
  "19305": "More powerful than my mother, then?",

  "19311": "Why are you so impatient?",
  "19312": "Well, what if it is?",
  "19313": "Shall I ever forget the triple horror of that spectacle?",
  "19314": "Do you deny that?",
  "19315": "Will you turn the hay over to us, the hay in the old stack?",
  "19316": "But that way of arguing by imaginary instances is not supposed to be genuine, is it?",
  "19317": "Or am I going mad?",
  "19318": "What is the price?",
  "19319": "On what shall I reflect?",

  "19328": "A surprise?",
  "19329": "Why cannot we launch into space through the scuttle?",
  "19330": "Is that what you wish for?",
  "19331": "Die for it?",
  "19332": "They must have been mistaken, surely?",
  "19333": "Absolutely?",
  "19334": "Is this the recompense you had in store for me?",
  "19335": "Shall I go and see if I can find them?",

  "19337": "And for ever?",
  "19338": "You whom I regard as the last word, the last charming and delightful word, in modern womanhood?",

  "22139": "What do you mean by a struggle?",
  "22140": "How do you do?",
  "22141": "Where'd you get him ?",
  "22142": "Do you wish to take it, and what price will you pay if I let you have the whole of it?",
  "22143": "Is this man in town?",
  "22144": "Any mail?",
  "22145": "D'you ever try it?",
  "22146": "You're playing secretaire?",
  "22147": "And was it really possible and true, that her last darling was to be torn from her?",
  "22148": "What did he care that his aunts were only two ignorant old women?",
  "22149": "Can your name be RUMPELSTILTSKIN?",
  "22150": "Are you not going in, sir?",
  "22151": "Ah, what is that?",
  "22152": "Can you not trust me as a physician when I tell you so?",
  "22153": "Then what, exactly, is your plan for us?",
  "22154": "How did you do that?",
  "22155": "If so, what news?",
  "22156": "Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as his father did before him?",
  "22157": "But when and where had I seen them?",
  "22158": "Did any see it after?",
  "22159": "Lithia?",
  "22160": "Why should not the same sort of thing happen to me?",
  "22161": "Do you think so, really?",
  "22162": "And you would say the same sort of thing of the physician?",
  "22163": "But was it cast after all?",
  "22164": "Both lost?",
  "22165": "Is he so haughty?",
  "22166": "How then can I know, my dear?",
  "22167": "Will not?",
  "22168": "Will it not slap and pinch the envious dowager, that dares to reflect upon its own delicious?",
  "22169": "Can you still lie?",
  "22170": "You wished me to know the reasons?",
  "22171": "Or else, why did she not go out of the neighborhood, and get a situation where she was not known?",
  "22172": "Do you know that he holds terrestrial beings under his control?",
  "22173": "Has she been with you long?",
  "22174": "Or shall we say that they are in harmony with the apparent social will only, and really stand condemned?",
  "22175": "An explanation?",
  "22176": "What shall I be next?",
  "22177": "Where's the larder?",
  "22178": "Suppose a boy sauced you back when you told him to do something?",
  "22179": "Putting ourselves out of the question, what would you think of a girl who could engage herself to any man under such circumstances?",
  "22180": "As at present?",
  "22181": "What is your name?",
  "22182": "Whom have I hurt?",
  "22183": "Do you mean if you give in?",
  "22184": "Or have tasted the bag of the bee?",
  "22185": "For rich caparisons or trapping gay?",
  "22186": "Would you have it?",
  "22187": "What hotel did you manage?",
  "22188": "Where falls the balance of freedoms here?",
  "22189": "What sauce are they most dainty for?",
  "22190": "What will have gained by telling me all this?",
  "22191": "Is there not love in my heart, and constancy in my resolves?",
  "22192": "Were not the odds the other way?",
  "22193": "Did he keep any record of his cases?",
  "22194": "How often have I asked you not to take my things?",
  "22195": "Rank?",
  "22196": "How did it begin, when did it all come about?",
  "22197": "Where do you go?",
  "22198": "Well, what is to be done?",
  "22199": "Can you hear a mewing cat?",
  "22200": "Have you any opinion to offer, count?",
  "22201": "How long must we stay, do you think?",
  "22202": "What, gossip?",
  "22203": "What is the matter with it?",
  "22204": "But may I be allowed to place the mark for the second shooting?",
  "22205": "Have you ever noticed that all little children are blond?",
  "22206": "And that cavalier, that guest, that nobleman who arrived before she came?",
  "22207": "When am I to wear it?",
  "22208": "How do you communicate?",
  "22209": "Have you enemies, then?",
  "22210": "Which of them will you test?",
  "22211": "Would you really do that?",
  "22212": "How is your old fellow?",
  "22213": "What bottles?",
  "22214": "Could we not keep it as a secret?",
  "22215": "But proportional to what?",
  "22216": "How did you come here?",
  "22217": "What would these insects eat, if we did not pass this way?",
  "22218": "Your advice, then?",
  "22219": "From the monastery?",
  "22220": "Are you not meditating?",
  "22221": "Would you compel such a state of affairs?",
  "22222": "Then how do you know?",
  "22223": "Where must I sleep, then?",
  "22224": "Supposing nobody should ever fetch me, how long would they consent to keep me there?",
  "22225": "And I?",
  "22226": "Are you alone, madam?",
  "22227": "Vulgar?",
  "22228": "Is not this change wrought in your minds a very important change?",
  "22229": "True?",
  "22230": "Shall I run on and stop them?",
  "22231": "What sort of road would that be?",
  "22232": "Is it your intention to go to an hotel, sir?",
  "22233": "Agree with what?",
  "22234": "Shall we go this high very long?",
  "22235": "Up?",
  "22236": "Was it this room?",
  "22237": "Anyone shot a fox?",
  "22238": "Then what business is it of yours?",
  "22239": "Dishonorable?",
  "22240": "What is the steamer's name?",
  "22241": "Do you often go to see it?",
  "22242": "How is it that the convicts are lying yonder dead, in the middle of the enclosure?",
  "22243": "But where should she go?",
  "22244": "You would be afraid to draw such an inference, would you not?",
  "22245": "Why, instead of a revolution, did they not content themselves with a reform?",
  "22246": "Why should you say that?",
  "22247": "And had it ready a nice little pinch of salt to put upon his tail?",
  "22248": "In what direction?",
  "22249": "And why was this?",
  "22250": "Now, did it strike your ladyship that she was like anybody?",
  "22251": "What do you mean to do with him?",
  "22252": "Not caring for their lives, is it?",
  "22253": "Will you promise to sit up with me to bear me company?",
  "22254": "What are you waiting for?",
  "22255": "What bell was that?",
  "22256": "And with you, governor?",
  "22257": "How came the words forth from her?",
  "22258": "Have I not always fought for your glory and interests?",
  "22259": "What, after all, was this blood of which she had taught herself to think so much?",
  "22260": "How do you do?",
  "22261": "But could it be otherwise?",
  "22262": "Must I compel men to render her fitting honor?",
  "22263": "For who gets wealth, that puts not from the shore?",
  "22264": "You feel, in other words, that she lies to you?",
  "22265": "Who has?",
  "22266": "And what crime has he committed?",
  "22267": "And whom are you waiting for?",
  "22268": "Why not say so?",
  "22269": "Nine, ten, eleven?",
  "22270": "And it was a fierce one?",
  "22271": "What is it they 'ad of you, sir?",
  "22272": "What have you been doing all this time, eh?",
  "22273": "Well, what does that lead up to?",
  "22274": "To whom did he call?",
  "22275": "And what are you?",
  "22276": "Could he be dead?",
  "22277": "Will you be willing to leave your present situation and try?",
  "22278": "What else can we do?",
  "22279": "Had he fallen during the attack on his rider, or was he straying in the bush, or had the convicts carried him off?",
  "22280": "How can he tell?",
  "22281": "Is it with me or for me that you are angry?",
  "22282": "Then how is it that I seem to understand them myself?",
  "22283": "What am I to DO with this?",
  "22284": "Where dwell we now?",
  "22285": "Why are they always anxious?",
  "22286": "What man has authority over himself?",
  "22287": "Who attends to them?",
  "22288": "And now, monseigneur, your answer to this proposition?",
  "22289": "And that caused his sister to refuse my brother?",
  "22290": "And you think she would be angry?",
  "22291": "What news have you?",
  "22292": "And have you not seen any of our other friends?",
  "22293": "All I'd done?",
  "22294": "If there are other causes of poverty than competition, does that prevent it from contributing its share?",
  "22295": "Why should I deceive you?",
  "22296": "What is it you fear?",
  "22297": "Faithful to whom?",
  "22298": "Ah, but if you got nothing to eat for ever so long?",
  "22299": "A horror?",
  "22300": "Do you think I was sorry?",
  "22301": "What's the matter?",
  "22302": "What about the chair?",
  "22303": "I suppose you will live with her now?",
  "22304": "Of what consequence is it to me, then, whether he be grateful or not?",
  "22305": "And why should the goblins mind you, pray?",
  "22306": "What villainy is this?",
  "22307": "Blewett?",
  "22308": "At home?",
  "22309": "Why, instead of transports that should have intoxicated me with their deliciousness, did I experience only fears and repugnance?",
  "22310": "Whats he?",
  "22311": "Well, he took that icon home with him for a few days and what did he do?",
  "22312": "Why, we must ask, do you trouble yourself so much about death?",
  "22313": "How does your lady, and how thrives your love?",
  "22314": "The greatest affection of which he is capable?",
  "22315": "Wife?",
  "22316": "A pox, is this your inns o' court breeding, not to know your friends and your relations, your elders, and your betters?",
  "22317": "And what's her name?",
  "22318": "What are those we know?",
  "22319": "Now do you want me to tell you who you are?",
  "22320": "Are you dissatisfied with my service, say?",
  "22321": "What is the object of slaying the spirit of vegetation at any time and above all in spring, when his services are most wanted?",
  "22322": "What is there in your son's face?",
  "22323": "Gone where?",
  "22324": "What length of course do you propose, dear heart?",
  "22325": "In what manner was I protected by him?",
  "22326": "What do you like best?",
  "22327": "Is it customary, I ask you, to help to tenderloin with one's fingers?",
  "22328": "Do you imagine that a person can die like this?",
  "22329": "Have you received the orders, and will you act upon them?",
  "22330": "How are they called who follow others in spite of them?",
  "22331": "Do you mean that you saw the murder?",
  "22332": "Was it not then a man like you and me, who first proposed this law, and by speaking persuaded the ancients?",
  "22333": "A political one, I suppose?",
  "22334": "What, I ask, in that case, would have been your conduct towards her?",
  "22335": "Do I turn to the right, or to the left hand?",
  "22336": "And suppose he falls?",
  "22337": "An expedition, sir?",
  "22338": "Is it not enough to set him thinking about it?",
  "22339": "What am I?",
  "22340": "Do you believe they're his own?",
  "22341": "And if I obtain this son, the object of my most cherished wishes, this son who is so necessary to me, who will take my place with him when I shall be absent?",
  "22342": "But you're not making a mistake?",
  "22343": "Was you a party in anything, ma'am?",
  "22344": "The knight they went to?",
  "22345": "Ask him what?",
  "22346": "Have I done something for the general interest?",
  "22347": "Have they legs and chops?",
  "22348": "What do you mean by this conduct?",
  "22349": "You're not a skater, I suppose?",
  "22350": "With him, aunt?",
  "22351": "Why does he not come to me?",
  "22352": "Among all the unfathomable precipices which surrounded him, which was his choice?",
  "22353": "Mais, monsieur, is it not time to begin to take more counsel of humanity, and less of your courage?",
  "22354": "How shall I requite you?",
  "22355": "Or when he chew'd it?",
  "22356": "How do I know, my dear, what young men do?",
  "22357": "How can I regret when what I did was inevitable?",
  "22358": "Can you have the heart to do it?",
  "22359": "Was not death infinitely more lovely and noble than such a life?",
  "22360": "When shall I set out?",
  "22361": "But what is this on the chest?",
  "22362": "Where's mother?",
  "22363": "Shall we turn?",
  "22364": "And now, do you wish to attend to your letters?",
  "22365": "May it be that, in some fashion or other, you want me?",
  "22366": "Do you know that the least garrison is of twenty companies of infantry?",
  "22367": "Have these confessed?",
  "22368": "Do you suppose I've asked him for an assurance?",
  "22369": "Are you sure it was my house she was coming to?",
  "22370": "And what are those hatfuls of pence and halfpence?",
  "22371": "What does the change mean?",
  "22372": "Monsieur le comte had an enemy there, then?",
  "22373": "Where are you off to?",
  "22374": "Why should this be so?",
  "22375": "His son?",
  "22376": "Well, and what next?",
  "22377": "What, you're on his track?",
  "22378": "Do you expect them today?",
  "22379": "A parson?",
  "22380": "Now, in what sign will the sun then be?",
  "22381": "Is that the way you love your neighbor as yourself?",
  "22382": "If they hear of this, will they let it pass?",
  "22383": "But where are you going,' that you talk about bidding goodbye?",
  "22384": "So you hate each other?",
  "22385": "Do you go home to dinner?",
  "22386": "Tell me how and why am I again a prisoner?",
  "22387": "You intend to look after me, then?",
  "22388": "Is not my husband here?",
  "22389": "And is she gone?",
  "22390": "If he had been your own boy, you would have put him to it, just the same, I suppose?",
  "22391": "We asked who they were?",
  "22392": "Is there not one among them who has seen it all, and who knows it to be true?",
  "22393": "Or cold?",
  "22394": "Are you cold?",
  "22395": "What were the joy of man, what else could give him pleasure, but pretty maids and noble dames?",
  "22396": "Can you not be more definite?",
  "22397": "Who is she, or how did you get her?",
  "22398": "Tell me why you came?",
  "22399": "Or, shall we continue on our way?",
  "22400": "Do you hear the dog?",
  "22401": "Is his dog dead?",
  "22402": "With our business, how can we get away?",
  "22403": "And what is this?",
  "22404": "What will then become of me?",
  "22405": "Even in the midst of joy, may he not be permitted to be gloomy and oppressed?",
  "22406": "And what does his eminence think of this love, which is, by the bye, no secret to anybody?",
  "22407": "How do they act?",
  "22408": "Which do you like best?",
  "22409": "Have you seen the army?",
  "22410": "But what have I here said, that reflections very refined and metaphysical have little or no influence upon us?",
  "22411": "Fwhat?",
  "22412": "They grow out of our knowledge, ma'am?",
  "22413": "But could you think, because the nodding husband would not wake, that e'er the watchful lover slept?",
  "22414": "And the papers?",
  "22415": "Can you not come to me now, at once, before anything terrible happens?",
  "22416": "My card?",
  "22417": "Tell me, I beseech you, what ails you?",
  "22418": "Of what race could these people be?",
  "22419": "Nevyedovsky?",
  "22420": "Where does your highness wish to go?",
  "22421": "Will not you, as well as your brother, intercede with your uncle in our behalf?",
  "22422": "Is SHE coming?",
  "22423": "Did you see her face?",
  "22424": "To love me, perhaps?",
  "22425": "In the first place, what proof have we of the fact?",
  "22426": "What are you trying to do?",
  "22427": "I strive to engage my uncle in my projects for the repair of the ruins, for the culture of those wide bogs and moorlands why is it that he turns away and looks down embarrassed?",
  "22428": "No right to be warden of the hospital, papa?",
  "22429": "When are we to discover them?",
  "22430": "Diamonds on the moon?",
  "22431": "What is your errand, then, with me, sir?",
  "22432": "Why is it that the dogs have failed to bark?",
  "22433": "And yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him?",
  "22434": "And do you think your power as great with the fraternity as monsieur le cure told me it was just now?",
  "22435": "And whose room is this, my dear child?",
  "22436": "And me?",
  "22437": "If that is the case, why wait till evening?",
  "22438": "What children?",
  "22439": "Lemme go with you?",
  "22440": "Is there any other point which I can make clear?",
  "22441": "ITS DECISION WHAT is a battle?",
  "22442": "Do you mean to say it's not of importance?",
  "22443": "Must I speak again?",
  "22444": "You are not laughing?",
  "22445": "Is there any news today?",
  "22446": "Or a fairy in disguise?",
  "22447": "Bingley?",
  "22448": "Let's see it?",
  "22449": "How, got the start?",
  "22450": "How many of such feelings were preserved from that subtle evaporation which robs them of their perfume, that gradually increasing inconstancy which lulls us until we forget to call the dying emotions to account?",
  "22451": "You are going to leave us?",
  "22452": "Wherefore should we linger upon it now?",
  "22453": "But you'll do it?",
  "22454": "Which of my friends, my lord?",
  "22455": "Are you going for a walk?",
  "22456": "What am I going to say?",
  "22457": "What, monsieur, will you leave us so soon?",
  "22458": "It not the blood in your veins as warm as his?",
  "22459": "Why was it useless to try to win any one's favour?",
  "22460": "But in the face of all of them, whose voice appeals unto me?",
  "22461": "Imprimis, he is older than my father?",
  "22462": "What has been the result of the first war?",
  "22463": "And you have promised?",
  "22464": "Have you the money with you?",
  "22465": "So you were at the races, baron?",
  "22466": "Dolly, why have you disobeyed me?",
  "22467": "So, that's it, is it?",
  "22468": "Do?",
  "22469": "Do you not see them doing the same?",
  "22470": "Does the lady go with us, my father?",
  "22471": "Never seen anchor weighed before?",
  "22472": "Do you burrow, or live in a tree?",
  "22473": "Where had he obtained that blouse?",
  "22474": "Sith then mine evil fortune would have it so, pray tell me, are any of the strangers still alive?",
  "22475": "Where's that?",
  "22476": "Some herb vodka?",
  "22477": "Nay?",
  "22478": "You hailed me, I think?",
  "22479": "And what do you want here?",
  "22480": "Is it a door with a lock to it?",
  "22481": "Is that honestly said?",
  "22482": "How could that be?",
  "22483": "And why should they not say so?",
  "22484": "Have you the diamond?",
  "22485": "Or the eastern?",
  "22486": "Is he aiming at doing anything, or simply undoing what's been done?",
  "22487": "Might he be called perfectly virtuous?",
  "22488": "But what else could she do?",
  "22489": "How ken I?",
  "22490": "Is such a hope justified?",
  "22491": "What man is there, even of those whom our age has called great, whose name, so many years after his death, could summon so many loving hearts around his tomb?",
  "22492": "What could I be to a man who had ever gained heartfelt love from a faithful wife?",
  "22493": "For your sakes or my own?",
  "22494": "Then I suppose that we ought to do good to the just and harm to the unjust?",
  "22495": "Philip?",
  "22496": "And have no fear of afflicting and destroying beings who are so dear to you?",
  "22497": "When is property satisfied?",
  "22498": "If the public felt that their wills were in safe keeping, and took it for granted that the office was not to be made better, who was the worse for it?",
  "22499": "How can the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall?",
  "22500": "How dare you?",
  "22501": "What about capitulation?",
  "22502": "Then would he descend to the south?",
  "22503": "Had he come home?",
  "22504": "All these days?",
  "22505": "Take fifty roubles for your cloak?",
  "22506": "Well, is she going to stay with him all day?",
  "22507": "What would it be?",
  "22508": "How will you forgive all my roughness in former days?",
  "22509": "By looks only?",
  "22510": "If I desert her, sir, do you suppose she forgets me?",
  "22511": "Will your majesty permit me to give orders in your name throughout this business?",
  "22512": "You never HAVE entertained it?",
  "22513": "What steps will you take?",
  "22514": "In a private car?",
  "22515": "The pretty little widow?",
  "22516": "Whither are we flying?",
  "22517": "Would anyone call you an old friend of mine?",
  "22518": "Then what conclusion may be drawn?",
  "22519": "Where did you get it?",
  "22520": "For what advantage would result to them from this or to the whole, which is the special object of their providence?",
  "22521": "Is this all of you tonight?",
  "22522": "Is't not admirable?",
  "22523": "Lucien?",
  "22524": "Is he worse?",
  "22525": "Be they of much import?",
  "22526": "Is it for this reason, pray, that you have also lost your cloak?",
  "22527": "Will your eminence be angry if I read you a lesson?",
  "22528": "His manners, I think, you said are not to your taste?",
  "22529": "What call was there to press it on so eagerly?",
  "22530": "And if he had judged her harshly?",
  "22531": "In what do I need help?",
  "22532": "Have I no friend that will make her drunk?",
  "22533": "How old, sir, said I, is miss?",
  "22534": "Whether the fruits of his labours shall be enjoyed by himself or consumed by the profligacy of governments?",
  "22535": "Dull now?",
  "22536": "How long?",
  "22537": "And with all this, does life offer aught substantial, aught that is lasting?",

  "22927": "How will you have them protect you?",
  "22928": "Those ostriches?",
  "22929": "What refreshment can I offer?",
  "22930": "Cadwallader?",
  "22931": "How did the rooster get in here?",
  "22932": "Do?",
  "22933": "Would you allow me to offer you one?",
  "22934": "Who knows what may happen in the campaign?",
  "22935": "In the first place, how did these folk come, and how did they go?",
  "22936": "I hate them?",
  "22937": "Will you help me?",
  "22938": "What's to prevent me striking a blow for myself?",
  "22939": "Quand irons nous dans la foret?",
  "22940": "You can be happy?",
  "22941": "How much do you pay?",
  "22942": "Shall I take it in?",
  "22943": "Am I obliged to tell you everything I have on my mind?",
  "22944": "WHO is it?",
  "22945": "Was he offended by what you said?",
  "22946": "Was it written in joke, too, pray?",
  "22947": "Did you ever see her in it, uncle?",
  "22948": "Clare?",
  "22949": "My brother, are war and battle evil?",
  "22950": "A louis on account for a fowl?",
  "22951": "Does he think I'll pay that?",
  "22952": "And what is your choice?",
  "22953": "Would you go to bed so presently, sir, afore noon?",
  "22954": "Nobody has anything else to propose?",
  "22955": "What facts?",
  "22956": "But then you would be close to the sea?",
  "22957": "Shall we get out and walk, then?",
  "22958": "Sonya, you've read that letter?",
  "22959": "Well enough?",
  "22960": "Well, what could this do but stimulate his humour?",
  "22961": "What now?",
  "22962": "And this is?",
  "22963": "Is it really you?",
  "22964": "Beyond man, forsooth?",
  "22965": "For what purpose a chaplet?",
  "22966": "Were the figures in the mysterious documents correct?",
  "22967": "Must you go?",
  "22968": "He's told 'ee what's happened to us, I suppose?",
  "22969": "But then, why did you ask me how many sweethearts I had had?",
  "22970": "Are you afraid of the sea?",
  "22971": "Are you sure, in her conversation with you, that your wife mentioned no names?",
  "22972": "Till then, then?",
  "22973": "How can you torture me and yourself like that, for a mere fancy?",
  "22974": "What was the meaning of it all?",
  "22975": "She ought not, ought she?",
  "22976": "But what was she to say on the present moment?",
  "22977": "How many ages had the rains and the stream been at work to scoop out from the flat tableland this deep and broad valley?",
  "22978": "What had these women done?",
  "22979": "And the virtue which enters into this competition is justice?",
  "22980": "Whither do you intend going?",
  "22981": "How do you suppose he is feeling?",
  "22982": "What monster can possibly fill itself with such a quantity of water, and spurt it up so continuously?",
  "22983": "Where's she off to?",
  "22984": "Where do you yourself come from?",
  "22985": "Now, monsieur le cardinal, did he not bring me up, did he not support me?",
  "22986": "But how could he know anything of it?",
  "22987": "And by contracts you mean partnerships?",
  "22988": "What, in its true sense, is a holy life?",
  "22989": "But is it fair to leave the job I got you and come to me for another?",
  "22990": "And you ARE a beadle, are you not?",
  "22991": "You asked when?",
  "22992": "Did any one ever see a capitalist, weary of gain, conspiring for the general good and making the emancipation of the proletariat his last speculation?",
  "22993": "Before what?",
  "22994": "In what adventure?",
  "22995": "Will aggression cease?",
  "22996": "As to sparing the girl, of what importance or value is she?",
  "22997": "Do you think the fellow was bashful?",
  "22998": "Is there anything else to correct in the history, senor bachelor?",
  "22999": "If they had come hand in hand all the way through life, with no memories behind them but those which belonged to each other?",
  "23000": "Could there be some being hidden in its profoundest recesses?",
  "23001": "Will you ruin your life and my own for the sake of this promise?",
  "23002": "But what is the treasure, then?",
  "23003": "You think women never can keep secrets, I suppose?",
  "23004": "D'you think they're rotten?",
  "23005": "When it came to be looked into, it was all a matter of the life and death of one woman, to wit me myself, and why should she not live, why should she not sit upon the throne with the man who loved her?",
  "23006": "What place is he to go to?",
  "23007": "Have you something to tell me?",
  "23008": "Did you say pig, or fig?",
  "23009": "And even if they did arrest me for being here, what would it matter?",
  "23010": "What did it matter?",
  "23011": "Which is yours?",
  "23012": "What was this figure of the shadows which had for its only object the preservation of the rising of a star from every shadow and from every cloud?",
  "23013": "Were you walking alone, may I ask?",
  "23014": "Now which is the worse defect?",
  "23015": "Why wonder?",
  "23016": "The anchorage is on the south, behind an islet, I fancy?",
  "23017": "Symbol of departure or of loneliness?",
  "23018": "Is it possible to have much respect for a system of education that thus insults reason and nature?",
  "23019": "And fell I not downright?",
  "23020": "Out?",
  "23021": "You can understand my feelings, can you not, monsieur?",
  "23022": "Why do you keep laughing at me?",
  "23023": "How shall they settle the dispute, since neither is able to make his assertions directly comprehensible and certain, but must restrict himself to attacking and confuting those of his opponent?",
  "23024": "Had they been seen?",
  "23025": "Do you think it could be otherwise when two human beings are drawn to each other by the irresistible force of mutual affection?",
  "23026": "It there nothing behind, that you will not tell me?",
  "23027": "Is it your pleasure to remain in the carriage?",
  "23028": "What people, if you please?",
  "23029": "You did not intend to say, eh?",
  "23030": "Do you reckon these two to be akin?",
  "23031": "If I tell mine, will you tell yours?",
  "23032": "Besides, who could tell?",
  "23033": "How has this ended?",
  "23034": "Where then is the constitution either that gives or restrains power?",
  "23035": "In earnest?",
  "23036": "Is that the crook I'm indebted to for the loss of my plans?",
  "23037": "Was it he, who as everything leads us to believe, saved you from the waves, and that under circumstances in which any one else would not have been able to act?",
  "23038": "Or should I brile a rasher?",
  "23039": "Whose child are you, and what is your name?",
  "23040": "What dignity?",
  "23041": "Carford?",
  "23042": "If I tell you that what have you to say?",
  "23043": "Would you wish to have her sent back to the village, or would you like to take her with you, or what would you prefer?",
  "23044": "Now then will you come or no?",
  "23045": "Who provides our means of subsistence?",
  "23046": "Did you see anything unnatural?",
  "23047": "You still work when you are well?",
  "23048": "But talking of heat, is there nothing I can offer you by way of refreshment?",
  "23049": "Then all is agreed?",
  "23050": "But did they never marry?",
  "23051": "Do you know why your ears are so big?",
  "23052": "Have you telegraph forms?",
  "23053": "What WAS this time travelling?",
  "23054": "Tell me, pray, if they are really clouds, what ails them, that they resemble mortal women?",
  "23055": "Well, what have you to say?",
  "23056": "YOU gifted with the power of pleasing him?",
  "23057": "What do you think of that?",
  "23058": "Why should I want assistance?",
  "23059": "Are you quite sure that you have not made any mistake in all this?",
  "23060": "Is this mine own countree?",
  "23061": "Was it possible, to breathe in again and again, to breathe out, to feel hunger, to eat again, to sleep again, to sleep with a woman again?",
  "23062": "But may I speak to you for a moment?",
  "23063": "You wish perhaps to boast of the cleverness of your investigation, to cry up your talents as detective?",
  "23064": "Would you like to telegraph to the lady assistant?",
  "23065": "As to his private expenditure, you mean?",
  "23066": "Why should a horse want to put itself in the human power?",
  "23067": "Where, indeed, is to be found more patriotism than in the country, greater devotion to the public welfare, more intelligence, in a word?",
  "23068": "Is that far off?",
  "23069": "What could be going on there?",
  "23070": "Cool?",
  "23071": "Moriarty?",
  "23072": "Where has she gone to dwell?",
  "23073": "What more could a man ask?",
  "23074": "To start with?",
  "23075": "Not going home alone, are you?",
  "23076": "But why did you say just now that there were very particular reasons why I should study this case?",
  "23077": "And if he refuses, who will stand then?",
  "23078": "So you have never noticed before how beautiful I am?",
  "23079": "Your majesty will not allow me to justify myself?",
  "23080": "Have I, now?",
  "23081": "At his what?",
  "23082": "You have mistaken my meaning?",
  "23083": "But does it apply to the present case?",
  "23084": "Where were you born?",
  "23085": "How about those occupations in which time is difficult to calculate?",
  "23086": "Do you propose entering any horses at either of these races, count?",
  "23087": "Shall we not pay ransom and go our ways?",
  "23088": "But the cause of this surprise?",
  "23089": "Will not their presence prevail against the current of his humour?",
  "23090": "Shall we begin by assuring him that he is welcome to any knowledge which he may have, and that we are rejoiced at his having it?",
  "23091": "Will you never change?",
  "23092": "What reason do you assign?",
  "23093": "What is that germ like?",
  "23094": "You will remain here, then?",
  "23095": "He will, I suppose, return there with you, if his sight gets strong again?",
  "23096": "Is not the separation and release of the soul from the body their especial study?",
  "23097": "Did the cow calve?",
  "23098": "What is sin?",
  "23099": "Who comes there?",
  "23100": "Why, is it over for you already?",
  "23101": "What can you do against us?",
  "23102": "How is one to explain this?",
  "23103": "What is the use of tongues when a sigh or a groan will tell all men feel while, perforce, they think in silence?",
  "23104": "A real doll?",
  "23105": "What?",
  "23106": "Why fiction?",
  "23107": "And what are you in trouble about?",
  "23108": "How is it to be expected that he should understand?",
  "23109": "Do you know what o'clock it is?",
  "23110": "Will you, or will you not?",
  "23111": "Why am I here to relate the destruction of the best hope and the purest creature on earth?",
  "23112": "And then so, do you see?",
  "23113": "Can he swim?",
  "23114": "What has happened?",
  "23115": "Why should she thus weep for him in paroxysms of truest grief?",
  "23116": "You know nothing about it?",
  "23117": "For wherefore should I love them less than heretofore?",
  "23118": "Did the others feel as you did?",
  "23119": "But how often has he been heard to restrain the violent and less reserved expressions of those about him?",
  "23120": "What is he in search of?",
  "23121": "How long did you stay?",
  "23122": "What are your products?",
  "23123": "How's that for the bare outline?",
  "23124": "How could he know, even?",
  "23125": "My good fellow?",
  "23126": "How could I be so cruel to you?",
  "23127": "It is my marriage you mean, is it not, dear grandpapa?",
  "23128": "But tell me, and tell me true, in what way did you die?",
  "23129": "How can one think with one's head all fuzzy?",
  "23130": "How can you expect that I shall continue to love you, when I see you maintain, when I hear you swear to me a thing which I know to be false?",
  "23131": "What can it mean, this relentless persecution?",
  "23132": "WHY so pale and wan, fond lover?",
  "23133": "Two in the morning, or two in the afternoon?",
  "23134": "Are you sick then?",
  "23135": "Who knows what may happen to us anywhere?",
  "23136": "Have I not heard you say that he would have had you too a soldier, but for your mother?",
  "23137": "What does a man say to a girl?",
  "23138": "Did she own she liked it?",
  "23139": "What is your own idea, then?",
  "23140": "But how can he explain that smile, that excitement after he had been talking to her?",
  "23141": "Should I, too, look back?",
  "23142": "Have you nothing to confess, somebody will ask me, upon this subject?",
  "23143": "Is this enviable or is it not?",
  "23144": "What was the object of the second man?",
  "23145": "Do you think I can stay to become nothing to you?",
  "23146": "Shall I have a barricado made against my friends, to be barr'd of any pleasure they can bring in to me with their honourable visitation?",
  "23147": "What I want to know is, where I ought to rank myself?",
  "23148": "Will you take a gold piece?",
  "23149": "Was it but the mockery of penitence?",
  "23150": "Are they?",
  "23151": "Saccharum, doctor?",
  "23152": "Of course you love him dearly?",
  "23153": "What was the thickness of this wall?",
  "23154": "What pen can describe it?",
  "23155": "Is controlling it as other property the same thing as destroying it, or driving it away?",
  "23156": "What is that, my love?",
  "23157": "Was there no one with you?",
  "23158": "Can you tell us what to do?",
  "23159": "To whom?",
  "23160": "When a good man sticks his bayonet through another good man, father of a family, or, perhaps, a great artist, what idea is he following out?",
  "23161": "Ah, it was you, sir?",
  "23162": "Shall we have the light?",
  "23163": "And into what a delicious riot of things am I rushing?",
  "23164": "Why did you not come?",
  "23165": "They are friends of yours, then?",
  "23166": "Did the government keep family histories?",
  "23167": "How did you guess?",
  "23168": "But how can the news be brought to you?",
  "23169": "Could they have fallen into the sea?",
  "23170": "The visible heavens and earth, the whole system of the universe, which may be conceived by the mind, is it created or eternal?",
  "23171": "But where is the other?",
  "23172": "What's the matter with me, anyhow?",
  "23173": "Are you set on the death of that spy?",
  "23174": "Does his mother not know this?",
  "23175": "Then you noticed it too?",
  "23176": "I am right, am I not?",
  "23177": "Why did she take it into her head to die at that moment?",
  "23178": "Saw you ever the like?",
  "23179": "And who am I, to nourish such ambition?",
  "23180": "You are surprised at what you see here?",
  "23181": "Do you hear the laughing and his voice?",
  "23182": "Shall I bear false witness?",
  "23183": "Is he not reviving slowly?",
  "23184": "What's afoot now, young un?",
  "23185": "What sort of a place was it, and what would he be like?",
  "23186": "Had any of them made such a hash of life as he?",
  "23187": "Who's the other cup for?",
  "23188": "Is there more?",
  "23189": "What paper was that?",
  "23190": "And when you know, will you tell me?",
  "23191": "How long would it take for a telegram to reach him?",
  "23192": "Do you wish to make good your boasted prowess?",
  "23193": "Is it not, therefore, clear, that in marrying him, you would descend to a rank below you own?",
  "23194": "How should I forget ?",
  "23195": "What boot these wonders?",
  "23196": "And who says so?",
  "23197": "How long have you been engaged?",
  "23198": "What they read in the church?",
  "23199": "If this sailor had escaped the perils of the shipwreck, why should not the captain?",
  "23200": "Oh, how can I live?",
  "23201": "But how did that old man, alone, in opposition to the general opinion, so truly discern the importance of the people's view of the events that in all his activity he was never once untrue to it?",
  "23202": "I suppose you can transform us into beasts as well as birds?",
  "23203": "How is it one never sees you?",
  "23204": "Where've you been?",
  "23205": "Now say if I conceal anything from you?",
  "23206": "What speech was there between you?",
  "23207": "Is not all that happiness when they are the three together, husband, wife and child?",
  "23208": "How is it you are so late?",
  "23209": "You have kept a diary of all these so strange things, is it not so?",
  "23210": "But your companions?",
  "23211": "I trust that there is nothing of consequence which I have overlooked?",
  "23212": "Is it for my own sake?",
  "23213": "Well, what are you going to do?",
  "23214": "And is there nothing on the way?",
  "23215": "Gentlemen, please you change a few crowns for a very excellent blade here?",
  "23216": "What, now, is the significance of this appeal from ANALYSIS to the false judgments of the synthesis?",
  "23217": "Is not that it?",
  "23218": "Forgive you?",
  "23219": "What association?",
  "23220": "But where are these persons, then?",
  "23221": "What doth he seek on the height?",
  "23222": "Where shall we lie in wait?",
  "23223": "And by what gate did they go out?",
  "23224": "From whom can come so many disgraces heaped upon her head, if not from him?",
  "23225": "Who invited you?",
  "23226": "Making love in play, eh?",
  "23227": "How, then, could his father's heart remain void, and closed to its influence?",
  "23228": "Have you heard the story?",
  "23229": "Would you really give us the money?",
  "23230": "But what other internal attributes of such an object can I think than those which my internal sense presents to me?",
  "23231": "Any children?",
  "23232": "How is it distant?",
  "23233": "Which box do you mean?",
  "23234": "How can a system of education flourish that begins by so monstrous a falsehood, which the sense of hearing suffices to contradict?",
  "23235": "Do you know anything about him?",
  "23236": "What are you talking about, then?",
  "23237": "Is it a long drive to the church?",
  "23238": "Diggory?",
  "23239": "How shall I set about it?",
  "23240": "His horses where?",
  "23241": "Have you no father nor mother?",
  "23242": "A present?",
  "23243": "Do you hear me when I tell you that, my darling?",
  "23244": "And when you can do better, you will?",
  "23245": "And does he catch plenty of fish?",
  "23246": "Did you ever stop to think of all the love letters that have been found after death?",
  "23247": "But the rebellion continues, and, now that the election is over, may not all have a common interest to reunite in a common effort to save our common country?",
  "23248": "Why do you say that?",
  "23249": "What could she have to conceal from me whose happiness she knew principally consisted in that of herself and her daughter?",
  "23250": "But if death is the journey to another place, and there, as men say, all the dead abide, what good, O my friends and judges, can be greater than this?",
  "23251": "Do you expect news from him?",
  "23252": "Will you trust me?",
  "23253": "On what authority, then, do you venture to attack universal consent, and give the lie to the human race?",
  "23254": "Say, is it thus those honours you requite?",
  "23255": "Where is he who called me?",
  "23256": "May I not come near you?",
  "23257": "What are you doing for it?",
  "23258": "Father, you have trained me from my cradle?",
  "23259": "What do you say, then, to my right?",
  "23260": "Am I so like you?",
  "23261": "Who was there to teach him better, or where was it to be learnt?",
  "23262": "But what is so headstrong as youth?",
  "23263": "Who put that mouse in my desk?",
  "23264": "Are they all to be treated, until they are large enough to be organized into a political community, as wanderers upon the public land, in violation of law?",
  "23265": "So does my grocer stigmatize me when I complain of the quality of his sultanas, and he answers in one breath that they are the best sultanas, and how can I expect the best sultanas at that price?",
  "23266": "What of him?",
  "23267": "Do you do nothing but architectural sculpture?",
  "23268": "Har you a goin' to pay me?",
  "23269": "What nonsense?",
  "23270": "Have you not said that that abduction was entirely political?",
  "23271": "But what is the difference?",
  "23272": "Is that a friar passing?",
  "23273": "Why did you not listen to the counsels of your confessor?",
  "23274": "Is he quite well?",
  "23275": "Did he himself quite know what he meant?",
  "23276": "Do you suppose it does not give me pain to hear you thus spoken of with scorn?",
  "23277": "Are there exceptions to this proposition?",
  "23278": "What are you?",
  "23279": "Are they longing for another rule?",
  "23280": "Why does she wring her lovely hands and beat and tear her breast?",
  "23281": "Oh, why not?",
  "23282": "What was going on in her poor little head?",
  "23283": "And at what height?",
  "23284": "I hope it was not on account of bad news?",
  "23285": "Your mother, no doubt, or some female relative of advanced years, resides here also?",
  "23286": "But what do you want money for?",
  "23287": "Shall I show her in, madam?",
  "23288": "You grant me the text?",
  "23289": "If we had no war out of it when thus placed, wherein is the ground of belief that we shall have war out of it if we return to that policy?",
  "23290": "Why do you ask me such a question?",
  "23291": "Who was speaking?",
  "23292": "And, if you will let me for a moment speak of the very highest forms of literature, do we not regard them as highest simply because the more we know the truer they seem, and the more competent we are to appreciate beauty the more beautiful they are?",
  "23293": "What defect?",
  "23294": "You're sure about the money?",
  "23295": "But why did you think about it, bishop?",
  "23296": "Then why, my friend, do you put on such a dismal countenance?",
  "23297": "What do you wish me not to have?",

  "24487": "What palette is rich enough in colors to reproduce so magnificent a spectacle?",
  "24488": "Was he not more foolish, inasmuch as he was deluded into taking words for knowledge?",
  "24489": "Can you spare me one?",
  "24490": "How much did you imply?",
  "24491": "Why does this choice surprise you?",
  "24492": "Shall I do so?",
  "24493": "Do you think I'm going to soil my mind with your dirty forgeries?",
  "24494": "D'you mind?",
  "24495": "What do you make then of what I wanted?",
  "24496": "Nitre ?",

  "24507": "On all the counts?",
  "24508": "But what if neither of these two ways will work upon you, of which doleful truth some of our playwrights stand so many living monuments?",

  "24547": "Therefore, as the family say, why not let well enough alone?",
  "24548": "You remember coming up here?",
  "24549": "Do you think I could eat it?",
  "24550": "Did ever any man believe in horsemanship, and not in horses?",
  "24551": "But when shall she die?",
  "24552": "Do you feel good?",
  "24553": "Is this your young attendant?",
  "24554": "Of all the orators, who, during the whole course of their lives, have done nothing else, which can you prefer to him?",

  "24563": "What should I get for all this?",
  "24564": "Boy of the neighborhood?",
  "24565": "Where were the other six?",
  "24566": "And then you bring news, do you not?",
  "24567": "And is it possible that this frightful combination of crimes has been invented by a woman?",
  "24568": "What plans have you made?",
  "24569": "And who was the person long ago?",
  "24570": "And after what fashion?",
  "24571": "What is there to hinder you?",
  "24572": "In economic language what are luxuries?",
  "24573": "The true question to be decided then is, whether the smallness of the number, as a temporary regulation, be dangerous to the public liberty?",
  "24574": "What did it profit a man to gain the whole world if he lost his soul?",
  "24575": "Mean and shabby, eh?",
  "24576": "Is it not so?",
  "24577": "How many arts do you understand?",
  "24578": "Had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me?",
  "24579": "Does sedition blaze so wildly in my land, that we have no longer the power to subdue it?",

  "24586": "Do you remember the rest?",
  "24587": "Why do you wish to return to companions you paint in such terrible colors?",
  "24588": "Why have they all been bullying me these three days about you, prince?",
  "24589": "What is the matter with you?",
  "24590": "What were you thinking?",
  "24591": "What can have put the shivers on him?",
  "24592": "Eh, boy?",
  "24593": "Does she exercise any authority over you in that way?",
  "24594": "Ought it?",
  "24595": "Why am I so old?",
  "24596": "Would she forgive him?",
  "24597": "Or with what peculiar force does he suppose himself invigorated, that difficulties hitherto invincible should give way before him?",
  "24598": "What do you think has happened this morning?",
  "24599": "No, why be sorry?",
  "24600": "Why this hideous costume, when he had so much money in his purse?",
  "24601": "Is any sick?",

  "24614": "What on earth do you do there?",
  "24615": "Who would spare himself now?",
  "24616": "Is that the boat, where I see a light yonder?",
  "24617": "Why did you not come down to breakfast?",
  "24618": "What is it that you've learned, what you're able to do?",
  "24619": "What sold?",
  "24620": "You are expecting a letter, then?",
  "24621": "So you have neither father nor mother?",
  "24622": "You mean it's for him you most suffer?",
  "24623": "How are we to get rid of him?",
  "24624": "Let us go, you mean?",
  "24625": "If they ask it what have I to say?",

  "24628": "You have not noticed anything?",
  "24629": "To what single individual has it ever proved an injury?",
  "24630": "Had he not that note this moment in his pocket?",
  "24631": "Do you observe the plunges that this poor gallant is put to, signior, to purchase the fashion?",
  "24632": "And this is the sum of what you could collect last night?",

  "24642": "And of what account was anybody's past, in the huge kaleidoscope where all the social atoms spun around on the same plane?",
  "24643": "You will take her away?",
  "24644": "Would he marry her?",
  "24645": "What think of 'em?",
  "24646": "What have you done with yours, seeing that it has not made you a miser or a prodigal?",
  "24647": "Are you going to imprison me over night?",
  "24648": "Do you think he expects to make a success of it?",
  "24649": "How can I help it, if he drinks?",

  "24690": "Whose is it?",
  "24691": "And his age?",
  "24692": "To this house?",
  "24693": "Why, pray, do you talk nonsense, as if you had fallen from an ass?",
  "24694": "But why do you take such an interest in me?",
  "24695": "Why has he constantly called them a series of measures?",
  "24696": "What causes?",
  "24697": "What will be the result of your conduct?",
  "24698": "On account of the great geographical discoveries, the important scientific results?",
  "24699": "Is not that always so?",
  "24700": "Can you take that in?",
  "24701": "Did I understand you?",
  "24702": "Well, is it over?",
  "24703": "And what would he have done had he overtaken us?",
  "24704": "And now, what have you got to say next?",
  "24705": "Do you know that for a fact?",

  "24707": "Or that he who errs in arithmetic or grammar is an arithmetician or grammarian at the me when he is making the mistake, in respect of the mistake?",
  "24708": "What was the use of thinking about behavior after this crying?",
  "24709": "Did it happen here, ever?",
  "24710": "Or rather, is not the nearest approach to the knowledge of their several natures made by him who so orders his intellectual vision as to have the most exact conception of the essence of each thing which he considers?",
  "24711": "Can the dead come to life?",
  "24712": "But cannot you have pity on me?",
  "24713": "Who will give me seven cents more?",
  "24714": "Is this true?",
  "24715": "In what way different?",
  "24716": "What I mean is, what about the next step?",

  "24722": "What are you going to do, my lord?",
  "24723": "Are we to do nothing, then?",
  "24724": "Have done, shipmate, will ye?",
  "24725": "Since then no part of our earth is left unoccupied, why is it to be supposed that the immensity of space is a naked void, lying in eternal waste?",

  "24731": "What call you the lord of the castle, sweet face?",
  "24732": "Is the exchange an equitable one?",
  "24733": "What do they care for but money?",

  "24735": "But you have promised not to go until she comes?",
  "24736": "But what is a cable's length?",
  "24737": "And we'll be in a friendly country?",
  "24738": "What in the world does that mean?",
  "24739": "D'you mean to say they're worth nothing at all?",
  "24740": "What is the use of counting on any success of mine?",
  "24741": "But who were the victors?",

  "24752": "Who were you then?",
  "24753": "What DID you do, you naughty, bad thing?",
  "24754": "What do you think of those fellows yonder?",
  "24755": "I suppose you have some cause of quarrel?",
  "24756": "Will she permit it?",
  "24757": "Shall I give you a lift?",
  "24758": "What's that he's got in his paddle?",
  "24759": "But what is this last piece of luck that has befallen you?",
  "24760": "And the wise is good?",
  "24761": "Now what have you to say?",
  "24762": "Who can doubt that the refusal to fight a duel through fear has caused many men an agony of shame?",
  "24763": "Have I gone through all this to fail at the last?",
  "24764": "What, with that face?",
  "24765": "And did he frighten my aunt again?",

  "24767": "Do you think I'm putting you into an impossible position?",
  "24768": "Can you hear the sound upon the terrace, through the music, and the beat, and everything?",
  "24769": "Are you a perfect fool?",
  "24770": "Will you let me go with you?",
  "24771": "How much time have I lost by illness?",
  "24772": "Is it enough merely to love if one cannot put all the poetry and all the music of heaven and earth into love?",
  "24773": "The next thing is for us to go and wish 'em joy, I suppose?",
  "24774": "How much have you done?",

  "24779": "And what had I better do about it, sir?",
  "24780": "Polly whom?",
  "24781": "And what we cannot do on a raft could have been done in the ship's boat?",
  "24782": "Does he still continue his rude assaults on those beautiful long silken tresses?",
  "24783": "Did it miss fire?",
  "24784": "What, in heaven's name, was it?",
  "24785": "What were you about saying, sir?",
  "24786": "But was it possible for him to be brave when he was by himself, face to face with his soul, or would he then surrender to despair?",
  "24787": "Why long for a life which could be for him now only an isolated, desolate, and gloomy one?",

  "24789": "How shall we prevent a conflict between charity and judgment?",
  "24790": "What have I all along maintained?",
  "24791": "Disko, what did you pick me up for?",
  "24792": "How will you take it, ungrateful brute?",
  "24793": "Why, then, suppose now an inertia which definitions contradict, now an external potentiality which nothing proves?",
  "24794": "Well, but what ought to be the criterion?",
  "24795": "Then, darling papa?",
  "24796": "Or rather was it a boat from the frigate, that was hailing us in the darkness?",
  "24797": "Is this the language of a rational man?",
  "24798": "Well, and how did the ring come into your possession?",
  "24799": "What should I have done as soon as I was hard and fast here?",
  "24800": "Why had not you as good do it?",
  "24801": "Am I going, or not, to my ruin?",
  "24802": "And who is ever silly enough to complain of it?",
  "24803": "But what sort of a way is that for bones to lie?",
  "24804": "Is it not evident, then, I ask you, that there will some day appear velocities far greater than these, of which light or electricity will probably be the mechanical agent?",
  "24805": "What CAN all that green stuff be?",
  "24806": "Do you recognize your quondam pupil, professor?",
  "24807": "I require to be let alone?",
  "24808": "Can he even see the feature?",
  "24809": "Well, why have I worried him, for five years, and never let him go free?",
  "24810": "But meantime, how am I to get on with my washing?",
  "24811": "Are there then chains for two which are forged on high?",
  "24812": "How could you have gone away and left me?",
  "24813": "How many kingdoms are there at present in the world, and how many more do we find in history, whose governors have no better foundation for their authority than that of present possession?",

  "24818": "What are we to do, now?",
  "24819": "And now, where is he gone?",
  "24820": "Do you not need to mitigate the struggle for existence more sanguine than the war of weapons?",
  "24821": "When will he come back?",
  "24822": "And why should I not dare?",
  "24823": "And is he in love perchance?",
  "24824": "Surely, this was not the only cause of estrangement?",
  "24825": "Where had he heard the name before?",
  "24826": "Where's my mother?",
  "24827": "Were you looking for us?",
  "24828": "But tell me, and tell me true, what is the meaning of all this feasting, and who are these people?",

  "24830": "Where are you taking me?",
  "24831": "What's all this?",
  "24832": "Shall you be present in the reception room?",
  "24833": "What was the matter?",
  "24834": "What magazine, or treasury of bliss?",
  "24835": "What do I think?",
  "24836": "Ah, why DID he?",
  "24837": "How could I ask you to gif up so much for a poor old fellow, who has no fortune but a little learning?",
  "24838": "Is it quite certain?",
  "24839": "Clayton?",
  "24840": "Why do you not think so?",
  "24841": "And you will permit me to accompany you?",
  "24842": "And you can refuse, you mean, eh?",
  "24843": "What, then, was there left to do?",
  "24844": "What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed?",
  "24845": "Are you so sure?",
  "24846": "Is that too simple a source of pleasure for some to prize?",
  "24847": "Then you knew her before?",
  "24848": "Have you not asked papa for money?",
  "24849": "Is there anything whimsical about me?",
  "24850": "Is this ingratitude, however?",
  "24851": "For nothing?",
  "24852": "The winch, you say?",
  "24853": "Was ever a man in such a fearful fool's position?",
  "24854": "But this kind man who has done so much will, I am sure, take you right on to my house?",
  "24855": "But if no one among us is capable of governing himself, then who among us has the capacity to govern someone else?",
  "24856": "Was personal happiness the aim and object of their ambition?",
  "24857": "Have you ever seen a wire jacket?",

  "24862": "Brilliant?",
  "24863": "Now, what is competition?",
  "24864": "Do you know that you are speaking to me quite as a friend?",
  "24865": "What do you do then?",
  "24866": "Do you think we live as cheaply as we might?",
  "24867": "Surely there are classified lists?",
  "24868": "Why ride into the middle of the battalion?",
  "24869": "May I ask if you can confirm these statements?",
  "24870": "Is not this an infallible and sovereign antidote?",
  "24871": "Well, what's this now?",
  "24872": "Now, what have we a right to possess?",
  "24873": "A cigarette?",
  "24874": "But what did he do, my dear?",
  "24875": "What act?",
  "24876": "What in thunder is it?",
  "24877": "And the man?",
  "24878": "How am I to understand you, mon pere?",
  "24879": "Why dilate upon what everybody knows?",
  "24880": "Might this be for you, sir?",
  "24881": "How can you learn lessons in here?",
  "24882": "Who be these?",
  "24883": "Do you love my son?",
  "24884": "What follows that angel?",
  "24885": "Will it strengthen our families and support our children?",
  "24886": "Why where should I leave them but where I found them?",
  "24887": "Shall he now be arrested in his desolating career?",
  "24888": "Do you know what that means?",
  "24889": "But why should I make a long story of it?",
  "24890": "Are you not jealous at all?",
  "24891": "And do you believe it to be so?",
  "24892": "Do you take milk in yours?",

  "24895": "Would any one believe it?",
  "24896": "What if I've accepted too passively the funny form of our life?",
  "24897": "What, indeed, can tend to deprave the character more than outward submission and inward contempt?",
  "24898": "If they bite and kick?",
  "24899": "Is there that about me that should affright a man?",
  "24900": "For how can any experience be adequate with an idea?",

  "24939": "And do they not share?",
  "24940": "Shall I meet strange, heavenly things?",
  "24941": "What is that thing?",
  "24942": "But who else?",
  "24943": "Why, how?",
  "24944": "Do you hear, my children?",
  "24945": "Can you deny that all that was craft and deceit and fraud and greed?",
  "24946": "How shall we set about it?",
  "24947": "Not too difficult?",
  "24948": "Were his father's religious devotion, his teachers warnings, his own knowledge, his own search able to keep him safe?",
  "24949": "Should they be embarked?",
  "24950": "Is my experience but of yesterday?",
  "24951": "Can I trust in you?",

  "24953": "Where are you to go?",
  "24954": "Do you want to earn half a crown?",
  "24955": "Wilcox?",
  "24956": "What do I mean?",

  "24960": "But will you not drink with me, sir?",
  "24961": "What avail is it?",
  "24962": "Oh, I must, hey?",
  "24963": "What more natural than to imagine that the violets and the hyacinths, the roses and the anemones, sprang from their dust, were empurpled or incarnadined by their blood, and contained some portion of their spirit?",
  "24964": "Or are they both in this their own reward?",
  "24965": "What do we do?",
  "24966": "How will you live?",
  "24967": "Will you remember that, if you please?",
  "24968": "Does he read ee very long zermons, my dear?",
  "24969": "What is a passport?",

  "24972": "Why this absence of mind, and sweet irresolution?",
  "24973": "We better than you?",
  "24974": "Did this mad wife of his carry it off with her?",
  "24975": "Had the man seen through him?",
  "24976": "But will you promise to have me took there, sir, and laid along with him?",
  "24977": "But if I do not marry?",
  "24978": "Why did he interfere with me, and fill your mind with such falsehood?",
  "24979": "But when one has no experience, how can one tell what is sickness and what is health?",
  "24980": "How can you tell who is poor?",
  "24981": "Is it so precious?",
  "24982": "Why am I to be disturbed?",
  "24983": "Will you take my advice?",
  "24984": "Something important?",
  "24985": "Perhaps you think I am mad, eh?",
  "24986": "Shall you have the courage?",
  "24987": "Will you forget him?",
  "24988": "Wait for you?",
  "24989": "Now, what fault can you point out in him?",
  "24990": "CUI BONO?",
  "24991": "Where had the dragon gone in such a short space of time?",
  "24992": "You've got a friend here?",
  "24993": "What has he made you?",
  "24994": "You keep the registers of entries and departures?",
  "24995": "To what tribe do they belong?",
  "24996": "And then?",
  "24997": "What does your wife want?",
  "24998": "It was his life or mine, but far more than that, it was his life or hers, for how could I leave her in the power of this madman?",
  "24999": "How did I get hold of that?",
  "25000": "Whatever is the matter?",
  "25001": "And it is true that you did not set it on fire?",
  "25002": "Has anything unpleasant happened since I saw you?",
  "25003": "Is it believed that axioms in metaphysics, declarations of right, harangues from the tribune, will put a stop to the disbanding of an army?",
  "25004": "What does not a man undergo for the sake of a cure?",
  "25005": "You a member here?",
  "25006": "What is your own experience of him?",
  "25007": "Me, young ladies?",
  "25008": "What are these corruptions?",
  "25009": "Why must he look farther than their platform when he claims himself to stand by his platform?",
  "25010": "Now, surely, if he takes so warmly to people who are not related to him at all, may he not take as warmly to his own kin?",
  "25011": "Not since the humour of gentility was upon you, did you?",
  "25012": "Governor come round?",
  "25013": "That boy's tutor?",
  "25014": "What is a soul?",
  "25015": "And with our wives?",
  "25016": "Who would think of plotting with a poor little weak creature like me?",
  "25017": "What is his exact kin to us, mother?",
  "25018": "Is this a new brand of humour?",
  "25019": "Yes, what were we talking about?",
  "25020": "Do I know them?",
  "25021": "And what business have you here?",
  "25022": "You know who bricks and mortar is, I suppose, sir?",
  "25023": "Oh, what's the use of me saying anything?",
  "25024": "I make the first advances?",
  "25025": "Why strive for the knowledge of things if we become more cowardly thereby?",
  "25026": "Why, how do you come to be here?",
  "25027": "What the devil is he doing here?",
  "25028": "What's he to do with the lassie?",
  "25029": "Why must people kneel down to pray?",
  "25030": "Do you like him?",
  "25031": "First tell the boys, what we have decided?",
  "25032": "What is it to be?",
  "25033": "Tell us, dear, what do the creatures look like?",
  "25034": "Do you see that whale now?",
  "25035": "How is it that there are birds enough ready to replace immediately a lost mate of either sex?",
  "25036": "You admit, I hope, that I have a right to speak about what concerns the dignity of my wife's sister?",
  "25037": "Will somebody hand me anything hard and bruising to pelt at her?",
  "25038": "Is he industrious at his work and respectful to you?",
  "25039": "Could her face inspire passion at all now?",
  "25040": "Why ought I to know?",
  "25041": "And you are not furious?",
  "25042": "Will you let me go away?",
  "25043": "Or at some public school, perhaps?",
  "25044": "They do, do they?",
  "25045": "Is not the night mournful, sad, and melancholic?",
  "25046": "I asked them, if they were at liberty to tell me the truth of what they were to do with me?",
  "25047": "Why are you sorry, sir?",
  "25048": "What prison is he in?",
  "25049": "Shall we go on, your excellency, fine champagne?",
  "25050": "Leave our brother to come to us?",
  "25051": "Will you really not have tea?",
  "25052": "Whom do you expect to find here?",
  "25053": "Have you no other to propose?",
  "25054": "What can a writer, who professes scepticism, have in common with radical views?",
  "25055": "See that blue dory behind him?",
  "25056": "But is an education which ignores them all a liberal education?",
  "25057": "What upon?",
  "25058": "But who has told you?",
  "25059": "Where are my priwileges?",
  "25060": "Well, did she say what she was coming for?",
  "25061": "How can I ever thank you?",
  "25062": "You own the name and renounce the alias?",
  "25063": "Is he of noble family, and rich?",
  "25064": "How then are we to begin our strike to destroy him?",
  "25065": "Who is this boy?",
  "25066": "And who hit you at all?",
  "25067": "What are these men's leading principles, and about what kind of things are they busy, and for what kind of reasons do they love and honor?",
  "25068": "Thornfield?",
  "25069": "May I ask if you are very busy just now?",
  "25070": "How can it concern him to learn how the self came to be what it is, or what it will be in the distant future?",
  "25071": "You think it will?",
  "25072": "But why should I weary you with details?",
  "25073": "So you kept him after all?",
  "25074": "And the queen?",
  "25075": "That we see before our noses?",
  "25076": "Can I never tell my story in a plain, straightforward way?",
  "25077": "Can competition in labor be abolished?",
  "25078": "You cannot help us?",
  "25079": "But what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance?",
  "25080": "What was the use of his being somewhere in the neighbourhood if she had no means of knowing where she could find him?",
  "25081": "You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?",
  "25082": "You will protect me from him?",
  "25083": "Had you heard?",
  "25084": "Can you remember that?",
  "25085": "Ever live by cheating at play?",
  "25086": "Why do you permit such a surgeon to have the care of the sick, wounded, and dying soldiers?",
  "25087": "And is that why he hits her?",
  "25088": "Why, what is there to understand?",
  "25089": "Yet you have a large establishment, too, I am told?",
  "25090": "And you think that I am going to send you back to that world which must know me no more?",
  "25091": "What is done to infanticides in this country?",
  "25092": "And did you see anyone?",
  "25093": "Well, then, what makes you talk so wild?",
  "25094": "You have formed one, then?",
  "25095": "Will you please pardon my rudeness?",
  "25096": "My dear father, may I beg you to prepare your mind for what I am going to say?",
  "25097": "With what my father said just now?",
  "25098": "What did you think of that, sir?",
  "25099": "Would you like me to sit down for a minute or two?",
  "25100": "He is going with you, is he not?",
  "25101": "Of what disposition is he?",
  "25102": "What is it, then?",
  "25103": "Where did you really get them?",
  "25104": "What did you expect to gain by that?",
  "25105": "What heart can hold?",
  "25106": "Had he left her there to her fate in the lonely jungle?",
  "25107": "How do you do, all of you?",
  "25108": "Do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not talk as fast, and admire what she admires as rapturously as herself?",
  "25109": "Curious?",
  "25110": "Do you intend to sit up for me?",
  "25111": "But would the man acknowledge the relation?",
  "25112": "What are you doing now?",
  "25113": "Do you suppose that if I had made such a revelation to the king, I should have been alive now?",
  "25114": "He had a passion for pictures, and why should he not be able to paint as well as anybody else?",
  "25115": "Are you the gentleman who caused the accident?",
  "25116": "And the pay?",
  "25117": "Husband?",
  "25118": "I know what everyone would say is the right thing to do, but what do you say?",
  "25119": "What difference can it make to you?",
  "25120": "Was he a proprietor, or only a usufructuary?",
  "25121": "You have sold all your clothes?",
  "25122": "Surely you learnt that too?",
  "25123": "WHAT is it?",
  "25124": "But at this moment who knows if we may not be frightfully crushed between the two glassy surfaces?",
  "25125": "We must take care that that affair comes off all right, must we not?",
  "25126": "Why do you shake me like that?",
  "25127": "Now really should a cock be brought into a tragic play?",
  "25128": "Is his thread spun?",
  "25129": "Is it, then, impossible that, in the present condition of society, the workshop with its hierarchical organization, and machinery, instead of serving exclusively the interests of the least numerous, the least industrious, and the wealthiest class, should be employed for the benefit of all?",
  "25130": "Have not you an intimate friend?",
  "25131": "But how, and wherewith?",
  "25132": "That was a very different account of matters, was it not?",
  "25133": "What laws mean you?",
  "25134": "And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps?",
  "25135": "And on what will you sleep?",
  "25136": "That is what comes of your gospel of love, is it?",
  "25137": "Beautiful?",
  "25138": "Is it really possible that perfectly innocent people are kept here?",
  "25139": "You know the road?",
  "25140": "So if I say they're gone, you'll bear me witness, will you?",
  "25141": "Why should you not mention the sum?",
  "25142": "To what a devil, then, said he, serve so many paltry heaps and bundles of papers and copies which you give me?",
  "25143": "How did you get such small small legs?",
  "25144": "What is that news?",
  "25145": "His nieces accompany him, no doubt?",
  "25146": "Well, but whom are you attacking?",
  "25147": "Am I fool?",
  "25148": "What should hinder it?",
  "25149": "Is this true, my pulse?",
  "25150": "Have you given in your resignation, mademoiselle?",
  "25151": "How can you make yourself so inferior to me, as to show such a bad spirit?",
  "25152": "How can that be managed?",
  "25153": "When shall we be able to fish again?",
  "25154": "And what may your purpose be, most lofty lady?",
  "25155": "And when the better part of their products are consumed by others at the play, do you assure me that their families are not in want?",
  "25156": "Do I combine?",
  "25157": "What good was there in doing that?",
  "25158": "How can you do it seriously?",
  "25159": "Read?",
  "25160": "Was I absurd?",
  "25161": "Live like this?",
  "25162": "And if I could, what comfort to me?",
  "25163": "Aglaya, may I kiss YOUR prince?",
  "25164": "You mean to ask, I said, what will be our answer?",
  "25165": "You do not mean to inherit that infamous crotchet my brother has got into his head?",
  "25166": "Not a circus?",
  "25167": "Well, what have you got in your ear?",
  "25168": "What came of it?",
  "25169": "What makes it smell so funny?",
  "25170": "Which way are you going?",
  "25171": "Sure, little woman?",
  "25172": "The boy's, then?",
  "25173": "Why do you delay?",
  "25174": "Proud, eh?",
  "25175": "Since no man has aught of what he leaves, what is't to leave betimes?",
  "25176": "How is he?",
  "25177": "Were there not the brilliant particles of a halo in the air about his head?",
  "25178": "I therefore turned towards him with a stern countenance, and asked, who he called fool?",
  "25179": "You want me to swear?",
  "25180": "What you standing there for?",
  "25181": "Perhaps he is just as fond of suffering?",
  "25182": "What's the matter with you, old man?",
  "25183": "Married woman, I believe?",
  "25184": "Will you grant it to me?",
  "25185": "And the chin, with its dimples, as in health, might it not be hers?",
  "25186": "What will happen then?",
  "25187": "You mean that the thing is supernatural?",
  "25188": "And if I do speak to her, my lord, what then?",
  "25189": "Was it sufficient?",
  "25190": "Have you ever committed a sin?",
  "25191": "Presented to whom?",
  "25192": "Not for myself?",
  "25193": "Well, sir, will you go?",
  "25194": "Where did you go?",
  "25195": "What have we done?",
  "25196": "Do you jog hither, wagging your tails, to pant at my wine, and bepiss my barrel?",
  "25197": "What was going on in congress?",
  "25198": "Do you need a doctor?",
  "25199": "Why, oh why, have I betrayed myself?",
  "25200": "Had he any intellect, any thinking faculty, any consciousness of his own existence?",
  "25201": "Outspoken, is she?",
  "25202": "Is it honouring your husband to dishonour his business?",
  "25203": "To whom resort for relief?",
  "25204": "What must be done then?",
  "25205": "Are yours like that?",
  "25206": "And now, are you aware of one thing, monsieur?",
  "25207": "Is he on this farm?",
  "25208": "Now, did you not think so?",
  "25209": "What do men know about women's martyrdoms?",
  "25210": "What can be done?",
  "25211": "Is the room to be got ready upstairs?",
  "25212": "Will you be silent?",
  "25213": "But how could she?",
  "25214": "How shall I bring forth my wife?",
  "25215": "And the greater the interval which separates them from philosophy and reason, the more strange and illusive will be the pleasure?",
  "25216": "Does he also desire his archic man to be got up in a manner befitting royalty at a certain date?",
  "25217": "What can I do for you, my child?",
  "25218": "Well, the question is, what do you know about her?",
  "25219": "Suppose that she coulde pittie me, what then?",
  "25220": "Where is the child?",
  "25221": "What will you take?",
  "25222": "But who could have foreseen such an attention as this?",
  "25223": "Do you know I have entrusted him with our secret?",
  "25224": "Your sister is dead, then?",
  "25225": "What have I done to displease you?",
  "25226": "How begot, how nourished?",
  "25227": "What was the good of playing?",
  "25228": "Would she not be marvellously fair to look upon when in happy mood, seeing that she is so fair in her displeasure?",
  "25229": "Any youngsters?",
  "25230": "Can a man who possesses the slightest common sense be so unreasonable?",
  "25231": "Have you kept him in the cellar all this time?",
  "25232": "Did either of you boys touch it?",
  "25233": "Why has HE done nothing?",
  "25234": "Arrest you, my most faithful servant?",
  "25235": "Why did she betray the two of them so terribly, in embracing the glow of the evening?",
  "25236": "Are you a missionary?",
  "25237": "And in what condition?",
  "25238": "Did they have any repinings because of their course?",
  "25239": "You understand what I mean?",
  "25240": "You serve the cardinal?",
  "25241": "Where is his pistol?",
  "25242": "What DOES it call itself, I wonder?",
  "25243": "Was she not very much surprised?",
  "25244": "But what is that blockhead of a benevolent gentleman doing?",
  "25245": "And how do you know my heart is innocent?",
  "25246": "Shall I leave you?",
  "25247": "His blushes, his stumbles, his awkwardness, and the number of feet which he crushed as he went back to his place, who shall describe or calculate?",
  "25248": "So what does it matter?",
  "25249": "Or whether we should hold that cowardice makes no difference in the end, seeing that we all must share alike?",

  "25320": "And shall we eat bread?",
  "25321": "Ankle all right, eh?",
  "25322": "But who was she?",
  "25323": "Why should there often be so great a difference in the result of a reciprocal cross between the same two species?",
  "25324": "Is there any better or equal hope in the world?",
  "25325": "But I wanted to ask you directly what you think of me, of my life?",
  "25326": "Are you quite impervious to good advice?",
  "25327": "What is the matter with me?",
  "25328": "Did you see herself?",
  "25329": "Are we lovers?",
  "25330": "And how could you think o' going to the pond, and taking your sister where there was dirt?",

  "25541": "Dressed as you are?",
  "25542": "Has it never struck you that the way to catch that man was to find out where he got his food, and so trace it to him?",
  "25543": "How then, sir?",
  "25544": "Can it be that extremes meet, and that the very excess and splendour of her mind led her by means of some strange physical reaction to worship at the shrine of matter?",
  "25545": "What shall she say?",
  "25546": "In what way?",

  "25963": "Why was it none would give it, then?",
  "25964": "Shall they be banished from the district, or from the whole land?",
  "25965": "Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?",
  "25966": "Did I abuse you?",
  "25967": "You who see your betters bearing up under this shame every day, meekly suffering under the slights of fortune, gentle and unpitied, poor, and rather despised for their poverty, do you ever step down from your prosperity and wash the feet of these poor wearied beggars?",

  "25979": "Was he again to be disturbed?",
  "25980": "Was she going to act and keep house?",
  "25981": "But why does he have this idea of a horse?",
  "25982": "Was that his work or was it possibly the doing of someone who was bent upon counteracting his schemes?",
  "25983": "Two minutes wrong?",
  "25984": "Do you not guess, monsieur?",
  "25985": "Where's your horse?",

  "26017": "Was he already with the queen?",
  "26018": "What is the matter, that with all his ill usage of me, I cannot hate him?",
  "26019": "Now, I beseech you, do tell me, have you ever attended to their pairing and breeding?",
  "26020": "Oh, what have I done to be blessed with such friends?",
  "26021": "Two one pound notes, or friends?",
  "26022": "Why indeed should they maintain a watch?",
  "26023": "What was I to do?",
  "26024": "So will you abandon your plan?",
  "26025": "What can I say that will enable you to understand the depth of my sorrow?",

  "26027": "What you 'bout?",
  "26028": "And of the pleasures of love, and all other pleasures, the same holds good?",
  "26029": "What does she want?",
  "26030": "Will it be safe to leave you there alone?",
  "26031": "In your room?",
  "26032": "Can dignity of mind exist with such trivial cares?",
  "26033": "Are they dead, ma'am?",
  "26034": "And what shall we have in lieu of it?",
  "26035": "It is a lovely night, and why should we not prolong our ride a little?",
  "26036": "You will not come?",
  "26037": "For arrears of pay?",
  "26038": "Copperfield, my dear fellow, how do you do?",
  "26039": "And is the city which is under a tyrant rich or poor?",
  "26040": "Was it not too clear that, let the matter go how it would, there was no happiness in store for her?",
  "26041": "Would you kindly send one of your constables for two buckets of water?",
  "26042": "But what is there, then, above the sun?",
  "26043": "Why are they not given up to the church, as they ought to be?",
  "26044": "To conceal his name?",
  "26045": "Is it at some set season?",
  "26046": "Did she know anything of his life upon the sea?",
  "26047": "Where is so awful a responsibility laid upon them?",
  "26048": "Well, my boy, what's there to prevent you?",
  "26049": "What more natural, after this, than the dream which came to him?",
  "26050": "If vices be genuine and virtue a deception, as you think, why do you call the inventors of that deceiving art sages?",
  "26051": "Has the law any eyes to witness your grief?",
  "26052": "How can I be vain when I know I'm homely?",
  "26053": "The little girl?",
  "26054": "Kicked on that occasion for cheating at dice?",
  "26055": "What proofs do you require?",
  "26056": "On business, eh?",
  "26057": "Why, what's happened?",
  "26058": "Not hurt you, did I?",
  "26059": "Was it the time the sandy cat walked round the balustrade?",
  "26060": "What insults, girl?",
  "26061": "And how does any one know whether he will stay days, months, or years?",
  "26062": "Well, how are you going to get out of that?",
  "26063": "Have you your stethoscope?",
  "26064": "Well, where can we find it?",
  "26065": "Was it mere social effect, fulfilment of ambition in the social world, in the community of mankind?",
  "26066": "How about this ad of yours?",
  "26067": "Do you still suppose that I am a boy ignorant of my own mind, and mistaking the impulses of my own soul?",
  "26068": "Must we then not be married, in order to sanctify the union of our hearts?",
  "26069": "Ay, but will you promise to come?",
  "26070": "What did you write about?",
  "26071": "Perhaps you are laughing again?",
  "26072": "So you think that these people have already quitted the island?",
  "26073": "What's a lad with good friends doing as loblolly boy?",
  "26074": "Who can tell if that mind, when the touchstone is applied to it, will not be found of a mean and vulgar character?",
  "26075": "But what time's breakfast, sir?",
  "26076": "Did you signal us, lording?",
  "26077": "Where was you raised?",
  "26078": "May I read it?",
  "26079": "Where is the treasure?",
  "26080": "You know?",
  "26081": "Snatch at it?",
  "26082": "Would not this mode of proceeding be preferable to that of causing letters to be opened by any one who may be employed, and replying to them by a circular to which it is only necessary to attach a date?",
  "26083": "Well, what say you to a friend that would take this bitter bargain off your hands?",
  "26084": "Just step into this corner a moment, will you?",
  "26085": "What will you do, dear?",
  "26086": "Who shall prevent him?",
  "26087": "Is it a profession?",
  "26088": "You admit you owe him three pounds then for a month's board?",
  "26089": "Have I not found her friendless, and cold, and comfortless?",
  "26090": "Is he learned?",
  "26091": "Ay, where are they?",
  "26092": "Who is there?",
  "26093": "Why should he feel joy at turning back?",
  "26094": "Must I really?",
  "26095": "And shall I not do as the first man?",
  "26096": "Was I not a fool, when I refused to look at or speak to him?",
  "26097": "And may we say that this has been proven?",
  "26098": "Does she cook the dinner?",
  "26099": "How do you come to know it?",
  "26100": "She was confined at your house, was she not?",
  "26101": "Do you know who I am?",
  "26102": "Very well what did I say to you?",
  "26103": "Father, have you any objection to my going away?",
  "26104": "And you are afraid I shall be unhappy?",
  "26105": "To reign in my place and stead?",
  "26106": "I suppose?",
  "26107": "Does the day look clear again?",
  "26108": "What if I were to think a little about others?",
  "26109": "Why on earth did you shut yourself in?",
  "26110": "Do you really suppose?",
  "26111": "Why one to come and one to go?",
  "26112": "Is not that the bishop?",
  "26113": "Why will you ruin yourself, your family, and nation?",
  "26114": "Why such a hard sentence?",
  "26115": "Will he not fancy that the shadows which he formerly saw are truer than the objects which are now shown to him?",
  "26116": "May I go and see her?",
  "26117": "Where did you go this morning?",
  "26118": "So very soon?",
  "26119": "Well, sir, in writing against property, have I done more than quote the language of history?",
  "26120": "I unhappy?",
  "26121": "But how did he come by his death?",
  "26122": "Can you believe it?",
  "26123": "Do you think that was done last night?",
  "26124": "Which is the way to the chapel?",
  "26125": "May we, then, be permitted to speak of the past in the present?",
  "26126": "What victim?",
  "26127": "Do we not own the country?",
  "26128": "Raoul, did you ever see anybody hung?",
  "26129": "May I be permitted a word or two of advice?",
  "26130": "If not, where's he gone?",
  "26131": "What would they think of me?",
  "26132": "What says the abbe?",
  "26133": "Might it not be that she would calculate that an interview would thus be possible?",
  "26134": "Why linger to add to the number of the victims of our merciless enemies?",
  "26135": "What is bad?",
  "26136": "And what now?",
  "26137": "Was he actually in hiding from the police?",
  "26138": "Shall he in the meantime risk the character and interest of the nation in the hands of men to whom he can not give his confidence?",
  "26139": "In the tremendous breaking forth of a whole people, in which all degrees, tempers and characters are confounded, delivering themselves, by a miracle of exertion, from the destruction meditated against them, is it to be expected that nothing will happen?",
  "26140": "What's the meaning of this?",
  "26141": "But how was it possible to effect this?",
  "26142": "Will you let me?",
  "26143": "And look you, lord, times are not ill, so wherefore should I risk a change of days?",
  "26144": "That certainly seems a satisfactory explanation, does it not?",
  "26145": "You have my birth certificate?",
  "26146": "Is it an odd speech, papa?",
  "26147": "Had you not observed it before?",
  "26148": "Who would attend him when he was sick?",
  "26149": "Till to your very doors the war be brought?",
  "26150": "A sleeping draught?",
  "26151": "Philip?",
  "26152": "But they may come any moment, for you left word that I awaited them?",
  "26153": "Why, indeed?",
  "26154": "Shall you?",
  "26155": "But how came the hand to discompose you so much, if it was only a letter of business?",
  "26156": "Why did this sudden conviction of a religious woman cast a terrible doubt in my mind?",
  "26157": "Was that then he or an inhuman thing moved by a lower soul?",
  "26158": "And the power which the eye possesses is a sort of effluence which is dispensed from the sun?",
  "26159": "What was one to think or feel?",
  "26160": "Can you tell the position of the rooms?",
  "26161": "To defend ourselves against attack?",
  "26162": "The child?",
  "26163": "When shall I have the answer, monseigneur?",
  "26164": "But where does it stay?",
  "26165": "D'you like that?",
  "26166": "You know that to be so?",
  "26167": "Was it possible to render any aid to the dying man?",
  "26168": "Widowed mother, perhaps?",
  "26169": "Has she mentioned me lately?",
  "26170": "And what your sorrow?",
  "26171": "Did you speak, my own?",
  "26172": "Is it only a voice?",
  "26173": "Why wonder about this?",
  "26174": "Did he not advertise?",
  "26175": "In what manner?",
  "26176": "What would they do if they found me?",
  "26177": "But how can I pay them?",
  "26178": "How was this done?",
  "26179": "Away from me?",
  "26180": "And, if so, surely there is good material in you?",
  "26181": "What was the matter with you, baron?",
  "26182": "May I have the honour?",
  "26183": "Will you come into the garden?",
  "26184": "Will it satisfy them, in the future, if we have nothing to do with invasions and insurrections?",
  "26185": "But what are we to do with her when we have caught her?",
  "26186": "And what do you say of lovers of wine?",
  "26187": "Where now the splendid future of her poor duped children?",
  "26188": "So that is what you wanted the money for?",
  "26189": "Would you like to take her place?",
  "26190": "Was it in the papers yet?",
  "26191": "What had become of that fair fellowship, so closely bound together by public and private ties, so resplendent with every talent and accomplishment?",
  "26192": "Who lives to the left there?",
  "26193": "Where shall we have tea?",
  "26194": "Would she ever die?",
  "26195": "And had the leather interior lasted with the felt cap through seven centuries?",
  "26196": "But why should anyone take it in order to keep it in his house?",
  "26197": "What will happen now?",
  "26198": "Next, how can the posting be accomplished in these mountainous parts?",
  "26199": "Does your soul belong to him now?",
  "26200": "How is man to know?",
  "26201": "And what can I do for you, esteemed prince?",
  "26202": "But this letter in which he recommends you to me?",
  "26203": "What are bulbs?",
  "26204": "Would you like to ferry me over?",
  "26205": "I hope your respected father is well, sir?",
  "26206": "And what, my lord, has been my fault?",
  "26207": "Then what is the illness itself?",
  "26208": "Is that what you've been so funny about this evening?",
  "26209": "But you are half asleep, are you not?",
  "26210": "Of whom?",
  "26211": "And suppose I were to die?",
  "26212": "I wonder where they do go, by the by?",
  "26213": "Is the well where you got this water near at hand?",
  "26214": "And does your honor know the four men who undertook to rescue him?",
  "26215": "Did you still hear the knocking?",
  "26216": "But to what place was I to go?",
  "26217": "Would you work for four and a half a week?",
  "26218": "You have a child?",
  "26219": "Can any man think it would be wise to leave such posts in a situation to be at any instant seized by one or the other of two neighboring and formidable powers?",
  "26220": "How shall we punish him for such a speech?",
  "26221": "What can be plainer than that the webbed feet of ducks and geese are formed for swimming?",
  "26222": "The sun?",
  "26223": "Diana?",
  "26224": "But who was she?",
  "26225": "Have you been in others?",
  "26226": "But what shall we say of the glee with which the effigy is often carried out, of the sticks and stones with which it is assailed, and the taunts and curses which are hurled at it?",
  "26227": "How died he?",
  "26228": "She asked, if she should call me again?",
  "26229": "Have you been there long?",
  "26230": "Do I interrupt?",
  "26231": "But it is quite understood, is it not?",
  "26232": "Will you carry him?",
  "26233": "Neither will he ever break faith where there have been oaths or agreements?",
  "26234": "If he comes back again, father?",
  "26235": "But who can tell what had happened?",
  "26236": "What then, I shall be asked, prevents these things from taking place with such regularity and precision?",
  "26237": "Who is the lady?",
  "26238": "And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?",
  "26239": "Is it not a just retribution?",
  "26240": "And where are the bodies?",
  "26241": "What do you say to coffee?",
  "26242": "Then we are friends?",
  "26243": "It was four years ago that I had it made, and what do you think I chose for the word and figures?",
  "26244": "Can I have missed it?",
  "26245": "WHICH candle?",
  "26246": "Shall we take their horses out, or tell them to find friends elsewhere as they best can?",
  "26247": "How much longer will you stay here?",
  "26248": "Is yours a hooky or a nobbly?",
  "26249": "And if he were innocent of any wrong, why did he not do something to clear himself?",
  "26250": "And it is to you, you graceless varlet, I owe all this?",
  "26251": "I have spoken of this because I keep wanting to know for a fact whether other people feel such enjoyment?",
  "26252": "Who is the fellow with him?",
  "26253": "And what will happen now?",
  "26254": "Can we be so unwise as to mean, that she shall keep a navy in our harbours for that purpose?",
  "26255": "Do you think that you are going to stay here?",
  "26256": "Are you going away, or has something happened?",
  "26257": "At the point where the path passes through the gate, you could surely pick up the tracks?",
  "26258": "What have we for lunch?",
  "26259": "Then it's a go, eh?",
  "26260": "What is't?",
  "26261": "Because she was there?",
  "26262": "Can you, of all the people who love her, bear to see her so?",
  "26263": "And if we had not arrived, what would you have done?",
  "26264": "Should you like me to take down his hat to him?",
  "26265": "Honest?",
  "26266": "Are all the flowers dead, or do some of them come again in the summer?",
  "26267": "Can one work there?",
  "26268": "Doing?",
  "26269": "I mean, will you be good to us, or do you intend to eat us?",
  "26270": "Will there be roses?",
  "26271": "Who gives you your maintenance, I pray you?",
  "26272": "What makes you pant so, my friend?",
  "26273": "Is it his fault that he is so ugly, and has so little sense?",
  "26274": "And what due or proper thing is given by cookery, and to what?",
  "26275": "Do you take me vor a shicken ?",
  "26276": "What are you to do?",
  "26277": "And why do you ask that?",
  "26278": "What is it, grandmother?",
  "26279": "What's the good of stopping?",
  "26280": "Had I right, for my own benefit, to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations?",
  "26281": "Have not often the profoundest efforts of genius been used to baffle the aspirations of the reader, to raise false hopes and false fears, and to give rise to expectations which are never realised?",
  "26282": "Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?",
  "26283": "By whose means?",
  "26284": "How much do you own?",
  "26285": "And the lakes, cousin, what do you say of them?",
  "26286": "Is that possible?",
  "26287": "What do you mean by lagging and a lifer?",
  "26288": "Are there no honest ones?",
  "26289": "And what is THAT to me?",
  "26290": "Are you unwell today?",
  "26291": "Phips had compromised, and why not he?",
  "26292": "To the office?",
  "26293": "Why should he bear all this?",
  "26294": "Successfully, I hope?",
  "26295": "Have you not heard the astonishing intelligence regarding her surreptitious union?",
  "26296": "Yet, what have I got to do with it?",
  "26297": "Still he's not worth her little finger, is he?",
  "26298": "Is the baby all right?",
  "26299": "Has she been stolen?",
  "26300": "Why must she do it?",
  "26301": "And by what means our news to him repeat?",
  "26302": "What in the world was the meaning of this?",
  "26303": "Is it possible that this stranger has now become everything to me?",
  "26304": "The question arises, what disposition are we to make of our accumulating funds?",
  "26305": "Is it of any use for me to tell you again why we must try to part with the house?",
  "26306": "How comes it that you would not answer my greetings for so long?",
  "26307": "And what did the firm say?",
  "26308": "You do think I could do some good at it, if I were to try?",
  "26309": "But what is to be done, old man?",
  "26310": "As they are or as they appear?",
  "26311": "What do I want with them?",
  "26312": "Where is that secretary person?",
  "26313": "What could he do, even supposing himself strong enough to fight the battle?",
  "26314": "Can one be too much alive, too happy?",
  "26315": "Who are to be the objects of popular choice?",
  "26316": "But will not the general be too hospitable for you?",
  "26317": "And that's the lad, sir, is it?",
  "26318": "Which road?",
  "26319": "And me?",
  "26320": "Oh, so it's not time to die yet?",
  "26321": "And how is it he has got this power over you, that you promise to marry him against your will?",
  "26322": "How could the devil from hell himself escape alive?",
  "26323": "And why so late returned?",
  "26324": "What about leaving that bright boy of yours on guard?",
  "26325": "Are you content, my beloved?",
  "26326": "If they had said I was niece to a piping bullfinch, what would you care?",
  "26327": "Have you served under the usurper?",
  "26328": "You would want nothing for so doing?",
  "26329": "What's injudicious, hey?",
  "26330": "Who of you heard his evil song?",
  "26331": "On you?",
  "26332": "Why have you come?",
  "26333": "What have I ever known?",
  "26334": "How many times do I love again?",
  "26335": "Then I may reckon on it, your excellency?",
  "26336": "You have heard me?",
  "26337": "You're the son of one and the nephew of the other?",
  "26338": "And at what date?",
  "26339": "Is he to go up for examination?",
  "26340": "Old lady?",
  "26341": "Have you found it?",
  "26342": "Who speaks for this cub?",
  "26343": "Is it not very unwise in us to go on spending the little money we've got when I can keep down expenditures by an honest occupation?",
  "26344": "What ought they to be allowed, or not allowed, to do, be, and suffer?",
  "26345": "How long have you been there?",
  "26346": "I may well be allowed to ask what has made my maid of honor, who left the festive hall sick, now all at once so well that she goes roaming about the castle in the night time, and in a dress which seems likely to be mistaken for mine?",
  "26347": "Do you wish for a name?",
  "26348": "What, then, prevented charity, union, sacrifice from maintaining themselves in the hierarchy, when the hierarchy might have been only a condition of labor?",
  "26349": "But what, miss?",
  "26350": "Observe, my friends, that in the position occupied by the projectile, an oblique position with regard to the lunar disc, our rockets, in slightly altering its direction, might turn it from the moon instead of drawing it nearer?",
  "26351": "And you never by any chance lose sight of him, I presume?",
  "26352": "Should we go now?",
  "26353": "How is one to vanish partly?",
  "26354": "Who was it that was eaten?",
  "26355": "Can I have another piece?",
  "26356": "Where is the use of the devil in that sentence?",
  "26357": "Whereabouts?",
  "26358": "Yet how can I let this knavish dog die and lose the money?",
  "26359": "Or how bear the expense of such a journey?",
  "26360": "I am to drag my present life on, holding its pains at your pleasure, day by day?",
  "26361": "One and all?",
  "26362": "And will the inspection have to be made now?",
  "26363": "You do not understand?",
  "26364": "Always ready?",
  "26365": "Can you get a few men together to go there?",
  "26366": "Shall we allege a musical dispute?",
  "26367": "Is it riveted to the planks?",
  "26368": "What, then, possessed him?",
  "26369": "Have you got it?",
  "26370": "Do you believe you have still a certain amount of it to expend this evening?",
  "26371": "Then why in the world not?",
  "26372": "What are they then?",
  "26373": "What can you love me for?",
  "26374": "Is he a presentable sort of a person?",
  "26375": "Why do you talk like this to THEM?",
  "26376": "But what was his name?",
  "26377": "What do you mean by gone?",
  "26378": "Is not it what you have often wished to do yourself?",
  "26379": "Would a boat be waiting for us with supplies and letters?",
  "26380": "What must have been his feelings?",
  "26381": "And shall we ever come into our own again?",
  "26382": "What do you want, my pretty?",
  "26383": "Supposing him to be attached to me, would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?",
  "26384": "But suppose she had run against this piece of iron?",
  "26385": "Who will be the jury?",
  "26386": "You think, then, that you can help me more efficaciously than your brothers?",
  "26387": "And do you think it's true?",
  "26388": "Shall there never be a fresh opportunity of trying the ranges of projectiles?",
  "26389": "Did he wake up?",
  "26390": "Was he nice?",
  "26391": "And now what will we do?",
  "26392": "Do you not know?",
  "26393": "And if that were the case would your honor condemn his action?",
  "26394": "And during these days what shall I do?",
  "26395": "Where have you come from and what is your name?",
  "26396": "But how shall we get back?",
  "26397": "How many of the zechins, your father saved, are still left?",
  "26398": "For on what ground can reason base such synthetical propositions, which do not relate to the objects of experience and their internal possibility?",
  "26399": "What are your additions?",
  "26400": "What are the foundations of inequality?",
  "26401": "How did you get it?",
  "26402": "One of those swabs, was he?",
  "26403": "Do you believe he can?",
  "26404": "Who has seen her?",
  "26405": "What did he mean by such a pagan idea?",
  "26406": "Was it because at that time we passed for very rich people, and you were afraid of being refused?",
  "26407": "And besides, what have I done to bring it about?",
  "26408": "Alas, what shall I wretched wight become?",
  "26409": "But suppose it's a woman?",
  "26410": "Why am I to give an account of myself?",

  "26418": "Shall we yield to force?",
  "26419": "Come, I do not ask for the sake of questioning you, but how did you get in?",
  "26420": "What do you wish, gentlemen?",
  "26421": "What does she?",
  "26422": "What, then, is the use of your worship?",
  "26423": "Was the gate open?",
  "26424": "Shall us begin it now?",
  "26425": "A recruit, sir, I understand?",
  "26426": "Sir?",

  "26507": "And you are certain that the queen and he did not see each other?",
  "26508": "Shall I go up and see?",
  "26509": "What have they come there to do?",
  "26510": "Do you know I think them exceedingly entertaining and strange?",
  "26511": "Will you let me take your arm as far as my own door?",
  "26512": "How's your wound?",
  "26513": "Did you not say that the dog's name was Z?",
  "26514": "You are the officer on duty, lieutenant of the musketeers, are you?",
  "26515": "For the emperor's return?",
  "26516": "Can we safely base our action upon any such vague inference?",
  "26517": "Now, what is the evidence presented to this body by one of its committees?",

  "26524": "Is not that the empress with him there?",
  "26525": "For everything?",
  "26526": "Is it in anger or in spite that you wish to go?",
  "26527": "Paid everybody?",
  "26528": "Will the greedy gullet of the penitentiary be satisfied with swallowing him instead of all of them, if they should venture to obey him?",
  "26529": "You will come and see me again before you go, chevalier?",
  "26530": "Why should you say such desperate things?",
  "26531": "You must promise me you'll tell no one else?",
  "26532": "What's that?",
  "26533": "Not here?",
  "26534": "Birdsburg?",
  "26535": "The count, then, is in the chateau?",
  "26536": "What did you go to the bandstand for?",
  "26537": "But what do you mean by living only for yourself?",
  "26538": "Why, know you not?",
  "26539": "But may I not see my poor child?",
  "26540": "Where find sufficient strength of mind to determine to begin the search, when her habits are fixed, and vanity has long ruled her chaotic mind?",
  "26541": "Gone down again?",
  "26542": "Whither are you going?",

  "26554": "You were going to drink my wine?",
  "26555": "What's 'cordeon?",
  "26556": "Will you let me?",
  "26557": "Meet?",
  "26558": "Where are you going to next?",
  "26559": "Would it not be so, mother, if we were to meet him in fact?",
  "26560": "Are you going to walk with me a little way?",
  "26561": "Will she find an excuse for the neglect of the knight in the duty of a soldier?",
  "26562": "Why should he shun it?",
  "26563": "Who is safe, if she be convicted of crime?",
  "26564": "Or who so safe from injury as the brother of the great?",
  "26565": "But where did you gather your wisdom?",
  "26566": "What's become of him?",
  "26567": "Do you guarantee it?",
  "26568": "When shall I have done weeping?",
  "26569": "And will she go about in a plain shawl, and a large straw bonnet, carrying tracts and bone soup to her husband's poor parishioners?",
  "26570": "How's the cream of clerkship, eh?",
  "26571": "But what the devil are you hurrying about?",
  "26572": "Are you afraid?",

  "26661": "What wonder, then, that his imagination should fail to realise the changes that eight years must have worked?",
  "26662": "But you will love him, papa?",
  "26663": "Is it because the sun is declining to the horizon?",
  "26664": "Do you require my services now?",
  "26665": "Does not this comprehend all, in fact?",
  "26666": "See you no difference between my charms and those of other women?",

  "26692": "And who is that young man beside you?",
  "26693": "Of what importance is the manner, monsieur, in which I have learnt what I know, so that I know it?",
  "26694": "Is it the personal and individual element in us, or the spiritual and universal?",
  "26695": "Why, where was the difficulty?",
  "26696": "Who deluded you?",
  "26697": "If the virtuous should be very few in number, how then shall we act?",
  "26698": "But to what family does it belong?",
  "26699": "Who shall gainsay your decision?",
  "26700": "Will you walk this way, ma'am?",

  "28370": "And a young lover come and carried off the bride, eh?",
  "28371": "If a man had stolen a pound in his youth and had used that pound to amass a huge fortune how much was he obliged to give back, the pound he had stolen only or the pound together with the compound interest accruing upon it or all his huge fortune?",
  "28372": "Do you recognize that, miss?",
  "28373": "Had not all the other places refused her because she did not know something or other?",
  "28374": "What could be the trouble?",
  "28375": "Sparsit, ma'am?",
  "28376": "Oh, is that it?",
  "28377": "Well, then, how is it that your eminence complained just now of want of information?",
  "28378": "What would they say, who made so light of money, if they could know how I had scraped my halfpence together, for the purchase of my daily saveloy and beer, or my slices of pudding?",
  "28379": "Had he the right to compel this sacrifice, knowing, realizing, as he did, that his child had based all the happiness of her life on the career she was now voluntarily giving up for his sake?",
  "28380": "Here, on the verandah?",
  "28381": "And how could this be properly explained to the young lady in gentle terms?",
  "28382": "Do you think it's because I'm really bad and unregenerate?",
  "28383": "Are you not?",
  "28384": "Then how about our position?",
  "28385": "And will he not?",
  "28386": "What recompense can we present?",
  "28387": "The principle is the same, I think?",
  "28388": "What happens in so many cases?",
  "28389": "Then we must have known equality previously to the time when we first saw the material equals, and reflected that all these apparent equals strive to attain absolute equality, but fall short of it?",
  "28390": "And since then?",
  "28391": "And as to her face, could it inspire nothing but passion?",
  "28392": "What was it then, and how had it affected his fate?",
  "28393": "Manager to a diamond merchant, or some such thing, is he not?",
  "28394": "And he does forgive?",
  "28395": "When all that failed, he boldly accosted him, and asked him, whether he did not remember him?",
  "28396": "Or, whither he should go?",
  "28397": "But we shall see you at the musicale this afternoon, shall we not?",
  "28398": "Should possibilities be worse to bear than certainties?",
  "28399": "Has the post come in?",
  "28400": "And when is this to be consummated?",
  "28401": "And what did they say?",
  "28402": "Is there a single sentiment it does not condemn?",
  "28403": "What are you stopping for?",
  "28404": "Do you want to work?",
  "28405": "Why are we now in the mansions of the rich and great, my friends?",
  "28406": "Are there many more?",
  "28407": "You can stay some time?",
  "28408": "The other side of WHAT?",
  "28409": "And you swim?",
  "28410": "Was he commencing to suspect?",
  "28411": "And in like manner does the touch adequately perceive the qualities of thickness or thinness, or softness or hardness?",
  "28412": "When you came in at the gate and asked the watchman the way here, had you any one with you?",
  "28413": "Where did your instructions come from?",
  "28414": "Why, then, monseigneur does not know?",
  "28415": "But, gentlemen, why are you getting angry again?",
  "28416": "And now it is you who have brought them together again?",
  "28417": "Was there not a spirit in him which, silent as it was, burned on him like the fires of perdition?",
  "28418": "Hurt you?",
  "28419": "What visions, they asked, could one but read them, must lie behind the quiet, dreaming eyes of that inscrutable face?",
  "28420": "What resources could they expect to find upon that scene of desolation?",
  "28421": "May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?",
  "28422": "Are you reconciled?",
  "28423": "Are you nothing?",
  "28424": "But what could have frightened the creatures so, and driven them from their haunts, when they ought to have been quietly sleeping?",
  "28425": "Or would you include the mixed?",
  "28426": "Was it a screw or thrust?",
  "28427": "Ah, then, is THAT what you've stayed over for?",
  "28428": "Do you know that he's the honestest and faithfullest fellow that ever lived, and that he has an irreproachable good name?",
  "28429": "What do you think of it, now?",
  "28430": "Why not?",
  "28431": "Always busy at what?",
  "28432": "How is it possible for him to be attained to?",
  "28433": "Is it finished?",
  "28434": "What do you mean?",
  "28435": "Do you hesitate?",
  "28436": "Is there any one in the lobby?",
  "28437": "I like the baron, but what better gifts can marriage bestow, than I already possess?",
  "28438": "Is not that saying illustrated by this?",
  "28439": "What's he?",
  "28440": "Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?",
  "28441": "Silver?",
  "28442": "Are we going to continue this pace all night?",
  "28443": "Can I be so lucky as to find what everybody is seeking for?",
  "28444": "Face?",
  "28445": "What else have you done?",
  "28446": "It stung you up a bit when I spoke of your game leg, young fellow?",
  "28447": "Sire, will you allow me to speak frankly as befits a loyal soldier?",
  "28448": "Then why speak to me about it?",
  "28449": "What the devil do I do?",
  "28450": "Who would ever know?",
  "28451": "Was I very gleeful, settled, content, during the hours I passed in yonder bare, humble schoolroom this morning and afternoon?",
  "28452": "Who will shrive the poor wretch, if you have come away from him?",
  "28453": "Why should I do so?",
  "28454": "And then she could not help remembering that he had passed some time with her under like circumstances, so why should there be any unfitness in the fact?",
  "28455": "Is there no mistake?",
  "28456": "Must he not have the qualities of a sage?",
  "28457": "Why is the sycophant thus added to the hypocrite, and the man who pretends to govern, sunk into the humble and submissive memorialist?",
  "28458": "Well, have we attained our end there also?",
  "28459": "From the dry rock who bade the waters flow?",
  "28460": "Do you observe that we were not far wrong in our guess that temperance was a sort of harmony?",
  "28461": "Whatever her sins, they were not sins of intention, but of inadvertence, and why should she have been punished so persistently?",
  "28462": "What was the bargain?",
  "28463": "And his dog also?",
  "28464": "Must I call you a liar as well as a thief?",
  "28465": "Why did you bring me here?",
  "28466": "If he could not speak, how was she to do so?",
  "28467": "And he will accomplish the trip?",
  "28468": "Is he mad?",
  "28469": "What is she there for?",
  "28470": "YOU insulted ME?",
  "28471": "And now, matey, did that doctor say how long I was to lie here in this old berth?",
  "28472": "My companion?",
  "28473": "For how can one?",
  "28474": "Game for a morning drive?",
  "28475": "You know where you left the team?",
  "28476": "How much have you lost?",
  "28477": "The boy's name?",
  "28478": "Why do you want to start on that again?",
  "28479": "And you yourself, what do you think about it?",
  "28480": "Why do you say I do not regard it?",
  "28481": "Must we, then, give up to despair?",
  "28482": "But where the devil are you?",
  "28483": "Living?",
  "28484": "Do you know what you have said?",
  "28485": "Well, and what has she been doing?",
  "28486": "Shall we not spend our immortal life together?",
  "28487": "Would this political deterrence prove acceptable to allies and to our own public?",
  "28488": "Should not all they be called mercenary who are always seeking consolations?",
  "28489": "Where is it, then?",
  "28490": "Do you really mean that?",
  "28491": "How could you get across?",
  "28492": "Can I take her into the spare room to lay off her hat when she comes?",
  "28493": "In case of doubt, shall it award the property to the first occupant?",
  "28494": "And the sago?",
  "28495": "You have not wanted for anything, vicomte, in my absence, have you?",
  "28496": "Who knows the will of heaven?",
  "28497": "What's that?",
  "28498": "Who's the object of your meditation, sir?",
  "28499": "Would you not say that he is entirely concerned with the soul and not with the body?",
  "28500": "Have we not?",
  "28501": "What does she think herself about him?",
  "28502": "Do you hate me so much as all that?",
  "28503": "Is not this to be rich?",
  "28504": "Should you like to retire at once?",
  "28505": "Will you ever go back?",
  "28506": "Why conceal your real feelings?",
  "28507": "In a hospital?",
  "28508": "Have you no information as to his abiding place?",
  "28509": "What is come of the troops that were encamped beside my palace?",
  "28510": "What's your names?",
  "28511": "For what reason is all this fume and fury?",
  "28512": "Of the painter we say that he will paint reins, and he will paint a bit?",
  "28513": "Will you ride on a few paces with the princess?",
  "28514": "Can you wash your own hands, or shall I wash them for you?",
  "28515": "And when shall we have the honor of seeing you again, your excellency?",
  "28516": "Are you interested in the sugar question?",
  "28517": "And they will go in three days now?",
  "28518": "But what good could he have done if he had?",
  "28519": "And what probability was there that a mere drudge would be able to manage a large and stormy assembly, abounding with able and experienced men?",
  "28520": "Gave him leave?",
  "28521": "You have, then, overheard our conversation?",
  "28522": "Will they sacrifice opportunity for the distressed, the beauty of our land, the hope of our poor?",
  "28523": "Esther, will you forgive me?",
  "28524": "Was this not preventing any inquiry, and, at the same time, assuming a higher ground through this pretended fascination exercised over a man who must have been of warlike nature and accustomed to receive homage?",
  "28525": "For what end are her fair complexities, her changes of soil, her sinuous coast?",
  "28526": "What was to be done with them?",
  "28527": "What must I know?",
  "28528": "Is it good?",
  "28529": "Would you four stand up for a moment?",
  "28530": "Is it not on this order of release?",
  "28531": "And, still further, I am tempted to inquire what has become of the indigent scholars, the sons of the masses of the people whose daily labour just suffices to meet their daily wants, for whose benefit these rich foundations were largely, if not mainly, instituted?",
  "28532": "There is nothing in my house for you, do you hear?",
  "28533": "On what ground shall we persuade the contented egoist, who has but a handful of commonplace desires and finds it possible to satisfy most of them, that it is better to call into being a multitude of wants many of which will probably remain unrealized?",
  "28534": "Do you hear now?",
  "28535": "What fog?",
  "28536": "Who was there present?",
  "28537": "What interest, I say, what interest do you ask?",
  "28538": "Not sick, are you?",
  "28539": "But what if I were mistaken?",
  "28540": "Then do you yourself know?",
  "28541": "Why should you, of all people, be so passionate about it?",
  "28542": "Would YOU like cats if you were me?",
  "28543": "Fifty cents a pound, was it?",
  "28544": "Do you acknowledge your faults?",
  "28545": "How can its error, being universal, be capable of correction?",
  "28546": "What had fate in store for these daring adventurers?",
  "28547": "Who do these three cavaliers appear to you to be?",
  "28548": "How did you know?",
  "28549": "And how could I do that, unless so be I was there myself?",
  "28550": "Are you still intimate with her?",
  "28551": "Or I my brains?",
  "28552": "Has anyone assaulted you?",
  "28553": "Whose?",
  "28554": "Is it in vain our conquering arms subdue?",
  "28555": "That idea is your own, and yours solely?",
  "28556": "Why have you never told me?",
  "28557": "Where are you going now?",
  "28558": "You will not say it?",
  "28559": "What are we going to do?",
  "28560": "How about these papers?",
  "28561": "Will nobody say what is the matter?",
  "28562": "But why should I repine?",
  "28563": "I must be trembling, does it not show in my writing?",
  "28564": "How had it come to pass that matters which with others are so private, should with her have become the public property of so large a circle?",
  "28565": "Where is the man who can say the fault, in part, has not been his?",
  "28566": "You would allow, I said, that there is in nature an upper and lower and middle region?",
  "28567": "Well, and what do you think?",
  "28568": "Have we lost the power of rendering you happy?",
  "28569": "Why not, sire?",
  "28570": "Are you sure that you do not falter or fear?",
  "28571": "And what can we do there?",
  "28572": "Want money?",
  "28573": "You're not going to be silly about it, are you?",
  "28574": "And have you ever seen her by any chance?",
  "28575": "You have heard nothing to the contrary, have you?",
  "28576": "Did you find him, gossip?",
  "28577": "Is it all over?",
  "28578": "What's that, sir?",
  "28579": "That you fled from your husband?",
  "28580": "Remember where he said the book was?",
  "28581": "And now, when shall we meet again?",
  "28582": "Did I say anything that was inconsistent with his having seen it before?",
  "28583": "Iron what?",
  "28584": "Can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than laws can among friends?",
  "28585": "Why contend?",
  "28586": "But may not this inference be presumptuous?",
  "28587": "What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant?",
  "28588": "And how have you wriggled onto the staff?",
  "28589": "Counting from when?",
  "28590": "What's the matter, then?",
  "28591": "Does he know you are going to be married?",
  "28592": "Are they not lovely?",
  "28593": "What would you do, then?",
  "28594": "You remember, I was proclaimed four years ago?",
  "28595": "I suppose you'd be above sittin' down and 'avin' a bit of dinner with us?",
  "28596": "Was he bent, then, upon ruining me?",
  "28597": "Why scare people?",
  "28598": "Where am I to let you know to?",
  "28599": "Any fault there?",
  "28600": "Where did you get that donkey head?",
  "28601": "Was anybody here just now?",
  "28602": "From whom and what about?",
  "28603": "Barkis?",
  "28604": "Who would these be?",
  "28605": "Of her character?",
  "28606": "Like my father?",
  "28607": "Yes, and why did you go in?",
  "28608": "In which world?",
  "28609": "You have arms, I suppose?",
  "28610": "Where are you bound for?",
  "28611": "And of what kind of trees?",
  "28612": "Going to college, I suppose?",
  "28613": "What's gone of your father and your mother, eh?",
  "28614": "Do you suppose they'll ever dance together?",
  "28615": "Do they imagine at home that I am so inexpert in the theory of drama as not to know this?",
  "28616": "What did you cut it off for, then?",
  "28617": "Johnson?",
  "28618": "What good is it then for the ball to be thrown up, or harm for it to come down, or even to have fallen?",
  "28619": "But would it be so?",
  "28620": "Do you play much?",
  "28621": "How do you know it is not too late?",

  "28626": "Is he in the house now?",
  "28627": "Have you nothing to add?",
  "28628": "Does the straw bother you, mate?",
  "28629": "My footprint, I presume?",
  "28630": "Would you like it again?",
  "28631": "Where is he going?",
  "28632": "And what did you do in the matter, bishop?",
  "28633": "Give me what you took from me, will you?",
  "28634": "Are you going to marry him?",
  "28635": "But she's got her faults, you mean to say?",
  "28636": "Is he a good workman?",
  "28637": "Who might have done that, I wonder?",
  "28638": "How long do you remain here, prince?",
  "28639": "But did you never win?",
  "28640": "Since I've been away?",
  "28641": "Ruined?",
  "28642": "Is the law of universal gravitation the law of universal nonsense?",

  "28664": "How shall I ever bring round to my adventurous views those whom I propose to desert?",
  "28665": "Did I have a father and mother?",
  "28666": "Do you remember me?",
  "28667": "But why do I thus torment myself?",
  "28668": "Where's the second boy?",
  "28669": "Are these lenses capable of resisting such pressure?",
  "28670": "How, then, could they catch it?",
  "28671": "A how much?",
  "28672": "We should, never quarrel, should we after we were used to each other?",
  "28673": "What do you want to say to me, my love?",

  "28677": "You mean the threat in her husband's letter?",
  "28678": "What will be the fairest way of considering the question?",
  "28679": "And if I prize so highly these two things, who could estimate the value of what remains?",
  "28680": "But was that all her reward?",
  "28681": "Then opinion and knowledge have to do with different kinds of matter corresponding to this difference of faculties?",

  "29542": "But how you goin' to manage it this time?",
  "29543": "Why should we, in the sphere of morals, lay claim to the possession of the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?",
  "29544": "Why should she slink about as if it were she who had disgraced herself?",
  "29545": "What reports?",
  "29546": "In the name of peace, what have you been doing with yourself?",
  "29547": "And that little pink cloud there, has it not just the tint of some flower, a carnation or hydrangea?",
  "29548": "After all, what inducement have they?",
  "29549": "When daylight dawns, how can we conceal our proceedings?",
  "29550": "Yanina?",
  "29551": "His talent?",
  "29552": "How could so many knights dwell together?",
  "29553": "What can we do, but lie here and starve?",
  "29554": "Nine?",
  "29555": "What do I mean by my look?",
  "29556": "Did he seem to be a serious sort of a man, or just a common rowdy fellow?",
  "29557": "Where doth one at present learn better to wait than at courts?",
  "29558": "But if it be true, then is not the body liable to speedy dissolution?",
  "29559": "What is my principle, perchance you ask?",
  "29560": "Come, how am I to tell you?",
  "29561": "Who the deuce is this lunatic who trades in bones?",
  "29562": "Could it be that her doubts were childish?",
  "29563": "Did I not tell you that you should have a home here?",
  "29564": "With his hand in the girl's?",
  "29565": "But what do I care about your allies?",
  "29566": "You have not a pistol, have you?",
  "29567": "But has he spoken?",
  "29568": "Then does any one else know?",
  "29569": "Done what, ma'am?",
  "29570": "Good street?",
  "29571": "Oh when shall there be an end of these evils?",
  "29572": "Down in the dumps again?",
  "29573": "To be prisoner of your erstwhile captive?",
  "29574": "Tell me why?",
  "29575": "Why, statuary?",
  "29576": "What about him being married?",
  "29577": "Prove what?",
  "29578": "Why should you throw away a chance, even if it be a bad one?",
  "29579": "But I mean does HE know?",
  "29580": "What's that about flatirons and cats?",
  "29581": "But when?",
  "29582": "Of course you know your A B C?",
  "29583": "Who is it THIS time, disturbing people on such a night?",
  "29584": "How much longer?",
  "29585": "When do you think he WILL come?",
  "29586": "What should he do now?",
  "29587": "Was he withheld by regard for his word?",
  "29588": "And what's the price?",
  "29589": "You must have a ladder?",
  "29590": "Sir, are you at leisure for five minutes?",
  "29591": "Shall we go to him this morning?",
  "29592": "Did this mean we had to drop everything else and concentrate on armies and weapons ?",
  "29593": "Why should he be made so wretched?",
  "29594": "You here so late?",
  "29595": "You cannot take me with you?",
  "29596": "Who goes there?",
  "29597": "Why wage campaigns that send no laurels home?",
  "29598": "And have you heard?",
  "29599": "What's to hinder you from staying, except the widow woman or the young girls would inveigle you off?",
  "29600": "But, my dear, are fellows never to get livings?",
  "29601": "And what is better than jasper?",
  "29602": "Dolly, are you serious?",
  "29603": "How could he tell?",
  "29604": "Where from?",
  "29605": "How many?",
  "29606": "Was it not extraordinary?",
  "29607": "Why do you kiss the gentlewoman so?",
  "29608": "Could we sleep under the trees?",
  "29609": "Wentworth?",
  "29610": "And is this all?",
  "29611": "May I ask why?",
  "29612": "Do they never go to sleep?",
  "29613": "Gotta da peach?",
  "29614": "And what was he saying?",
  "29615": "But when were the hopes of humanity fulfilled?",
  "29616": "How did he do?",
  "29617": "What's your lay?",
  "29618": "Who at this court is so audacious as to wish to injure those whom the queen loves?",
  "29619": "Merciful heavens?",
  "29620": "Have you only just come?",
  "29621": "Over there, do you see, where the pools are?",
  "29622": "Let me ask you why you deceived me?",
  "29623": "Shall you keep it or send it back?",
  "29624": "To what do you refer?",
  "29625": "If there be no life in earth, how could life come out of it?",
  "29626": "Is the money, then, ready?",
  "29627": "Can you see them?",
  "29628": "Is there THREE of 'em then?",
  "29629": "Where do we go?",
  "29630": "Would he not one day make you pay for keeping this terrible secret?",
  "29631": "Will there ever be an end to these fooleries?",
  "29632": "But, then, why should he smile so kindly upon you?",
  "29633": "What misfortune?",
  "29634": "How could I wish to make anything hard to you either by my words or conduct?",
  "29635": "What was the meaning of this?",
  "29636": "Would he never come back?",
  "29637": "Are you staying at the flat?",
  "29638": "How could I be expected to know?",
  "29639": "Have you chased them away, too?",
  "29640": "Is he one of your men?",
  "29641": "Everything?",
  "29642": "What have you been doing?",
  "29643": "After all, what could it matter to her whether he were here or there, on this ship or another, ashore or not?",
  "29644": "Are you not near me?",
  "29645": "It is not your business, is it?",
  "29646": "In three days?",
  "29647": "Well then, do you think I am awake?",
  "29648": "Is she ill, or only famished?",
  "29649": "Have you any more notions?",
  "29650": "You are not well?",
  "29651": "Cohan?",
  "29652": "Has he committed a sin?",
  "29653": "Do you want to see it?",
  "29654": "You are still with us, I presume?",
  "29655": "And where is he gone to?",
  "29656": "What means had been employed to kidnap this innocent creature, and with what object?",
  "29657": "How can I hope to save her?",
  "29658": "What is't you do?",
  "29659": "What was?",
  "29660": "Well, will you go?",
  "29661": "And your grandparents?",
  "29662": "What, that child?",
  "29663": "I suppose you would hardly know me again now I've got a pair of whiskers?",
  "29664": "Your wife?",
  "29665": "If he be ever so improper, how can I help his having written to me?",
  "29666": "What jars to our preconceptions will he and I receive here?",
  "29667": "How could there be any good in a woman that everybody spoke ill of?",
  "29668": "What call shall I send?",
  "29669": "How do you name yourself?",
  "29670": "Did you understand that sign?",
  "29671": "Will you come in?",
  "29672": "Cost?",
  "29673": "Why, man, what are you talking about?",
  "29674": "But do you know where?",
  "29675": "Was it because she was bareheaded, was it merely her natural expression?",
  "29676": "Have you shadowed her?",
  "29677": "Will you come back?",
  "29678": "And what else can he be after?",
  "29679": "Then how do you come to be going there?",
  "29680": "Well, if war is a terrible thing, what about patriotism, which is the idea at the base of it?",
  "29681": "Does it please your honor that I should accompany you?",
  "29682": "Why, is not here your cloak?",
  "29683": "Are all the cranes and pulleys sure?",
  "29684": "She is in prison?",
  "29685": "But there is nothing comforting in having your hair cut off because you've dyed it a dreadful color, is there?",
  "29686": "It is not like her, you say?",
  "29687": "And who is he?",
  "29688": "What letter is it?",
  "29689": "And you, what the devil do you want here?",
  "29690": "Suppose we have a little game of euchre?",
  "29691": "What does it all mean?",
  "29692": "But when you leave him, for instance?",
  "29693": "Only slightly touched?",
  "29694": "Was it for so petty a thing that he had done all that he had done?",
  "29695": "Perhaps this incident was connected with that of the bullet?",
  "29696": "Conway, what are you going to do?",
  "29697": "Are limes the fashion now?",
  "29698": "Rebecca, may I give you a wing?",
  "29699": "What were the defects of this remarkable man?",
  "29700": "But how were we to get him into his clothes again?",
  "29701": "I hope I was not the trouble, guardian?",
  "29702": "Where is beauty?",
  "29703": "Where has he gone?",
  "29704": "Well, then, how if we were to begin with oysters, and so change the whole program?",
  "29705": "The face he pulled?",
  "29706": "Can they govern a family, or take care of the poor babes whom they bring into the world?",
  "29707": "Is it, then, stretching our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the occasion of the change?",
  "29708": "Neither gold nor rank?",
  "29709": "But was he alone or accompanied?",
  "29710": "WHY, you dear delightful woman, did you like it?",
  "29711": "Who is knocking?",
  "29712": "How can you speak of it in that way?",
  "29713": "Do you mean that we are going to die too?",
  "29714": "Why not stay here now and be quiet?",
  "29715": "You have since reflected?",
  "29716": "Do you think your hotel man will open his hotel this month?",
  "29717": "Is that all, gentlemen?",
  "29718": "Why should you be inconvenienced?",
  "29719": "Thed what are you?",
  "29720": "Did anyone ever hear the like?",
  "29721": "Is there too much vanity in what I have just said?",
  "29722": "What is that?",
  "29723": "You would not marry him, now that he is free?",
  "29724": "And the unjust is good and wise, and the just is neither?",
  "29725": "Who wrote it?",
  "29726": "Now, was that somebody brother to the prisoner at the bar?",
  "29727": "Well, does the colonel treat you well?",
  "29728": "How long are we to endure it?",
  "29729": "What is it that I manage?",
  "29730": "You made paper, pens and ink?",
  "29731": "But why talk now?",
  "29732": "Is it a renewal of the former proposition or what?",
  "29733": "But what to do?",
  "29734": "Shall we charge them or no?",
  "29735": "Why should I tire you with particulars of my consequence?",
  "29736": "Then why do you apply to me?",
  "29737": "And have they appointed the matron?",
  "29738": "And why not?",
  "29739": "Has a girl of fourteen a heart large enough, vigorous enough, to hold the swelling spring of pure, full, fervid eloquence?",
  "29740": "I understand you to say that there are three students who use this stair, and are in the habit of passing your door?",
  "29741": "Our neighbor?",
  "29742": "Where would they meet?",
  "29743": "How was it I noticed nothing?",
  "29744": "Where are you going, bandit?",
  "29745": "You do not doubt his affection?",
  "29746": "What orders?",
  "29747": "Can you walk?",
  "29748": "If he had been positively in earnest, with downright manly earnestness, would he have allowed the thing to drag itself with a weak uncertain life, as it had done for the last two or three years?",
  "29749": "Even allowing that she does not love him, that she pays no heed to her vows and promises, how can she give herself to another man?",
  "29750": "Who gave her away?",
  "29751": "To what had he brought himself?",
  "29752": "What can be done for it?",
  "29753": "Is everything as it should be?",
  "29754": "I trust he does not suffer?",
  "29755": "How do you mean, the general?",
  "29756": "And how many hours a day did you do lessons?",
  "29757": "Is it a very wicked place?",
  "29758": "Why had our incomprehensible guide led us to the bottom of this submarine crypt?",
  "29759": "What are you doing tonight?",
  "29760": "Will you take me away with you?",
  "29761": "I hope we are not to part as enemies?",
  "29762": "Ah, dear sister, how can I answer this question?",
  "29763": "Why will you think so?",
  "29764": "What could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as it dropped on her work?",
  "29765": "Do you mean me, sir?",
  "29766": "Did he not pretend to go back to his tribe, who had treated him ill, and driven him from their wigwams like a dog?",
  "29767": "But how can we find the way in this fog?",
  "29768": "In a decadent society, to come nearer to the problems which concern us in ethics, must a man strive to realize the social will expressed in progressive decadence?",
  "29769": "Had he noticed that the days had been only six hours long, and that the weight of the atmosphere was so much diminished?",
  "29770": "What was the man doing when you saw him?",
  "29771": "What does all this knowing mean to me?",
  "29772": "Might not that person by patient waiting be covering silent preparation, and proving his fitness for the glorious task before him?",
  "29773": "But what if it's worse than this?",
  "29774": "Not HE?",
  "29775": "Do I try and catch them?",
  "29776": "Still inquisitive?",
  "29777": "Is it my fault if fortune, which has frowned on you, has been kind to me?",
  "29778": "You haf not got something to drink, hey?",
  "29779": "Yes, dear?",
  "29780": "Art shod with lead?",
  "29781": "Wherein have I hurt you?",
  "29782": "Will our help come from you?",
  "29783": "How should there be eighteen copies, all different from the original, and from one another, in minor matters?",
  "29784": "In the meantime, who can foretell what would be the sufferings and privations of the people during its existence?",
  "29785": "What is it, grandmother?",
  "29786": "If we could get a drink?",
  "29787": "Is it not the duty of the nations to combine and to relieve suffering humanity?",
  "29788": "Then that is not the knowledge which we are seeking to discover?",
  "29789": "You met a monk, did you not?",
  "29790": "Can I not read your heart?",
  "29791": "Now, then, the difference between property and possession being well established, and it being settled that the former, for the reasons which I have just given, must necessarily disappear, is it best, for the slight advantage of restoring an etymology, to retain the word PROPERTY?",
  "29792": "What, it seems I do not drink but by an attorney?",
  "29793": "What was the cause of this flaw?",
  "29794": "Shall I give her?",
  "29795": "Was it right to be frightened already?",
  "29796": "At what hour would you wish the ceremony performed?",
  "29797": "Do you mean a compliment?",
  "29798": "Do you not know that there is a spirit within you different from flesh?",
  "29799": "In this painful moment can the best of fathers wish to destroy my domestic happiness, the only kind which now remains to me?",
  "29800": "What struggle was going on within him?",
  "29801": "So that he still expects his money?",
  "29802": "What will become of us if she dies, as I always fear when her face is like that?",
  "29803": "And if not, is he a devil?",
  "29804": "You your command, and I my title?",
  "29805": "Why has she not written to me, then?",
  "29806": "By this train?",
  "29807": "Are they good to eat?",
  "29808": "Will we trample again upon that torn and mangled corpse?",
  "29809": "And who can wonder if it be so, mother?",
  "29810": "Are you comfortable now, sir?",
  "29811": "Swear it was not true?",
  "29812": "What good was moral support in providing a million and a half?",
  "29813": "But can you restore him back to life?",
  "29814": "I hope you're well?",
  "29815": "Did he designedly conceal some incident of his captivity?",
  "29816": "You remember that young fellow mother wanted me to have?",
  "29817": "So there are fashions, nowadays, in illness, are there?",
  "29818": "Then, sir, you are a favourite, I find, among the ladies?",
  "29819": "Do he rave about his mother just the same, poor fellow?",
  "29820": "Where is it?",
  "29821": "Yours then are rather here?",
  "29822": "Are you in a position to quit the post of superintendent at this moment?",
  "29823": "Do you observe anything remarkable about that?",
  "29824": "How was this to be done?",
  "29825": "Have you never heard talk of a certain secret?",
  "29826": "Did he come here voluntarily?",
  "29827": "What do you really think of her?",
  "29828": "When did he give it you?",
  "29829": "Unintentionally?",
  "29830": "Harry?",
  "29831": "Am I to come home?",
  "29832": "Now if this tenderness for the dead is such an exercise of these three theological virtues, and if, again, even heroic sanctity consists principally in their exercise, what store ought we not to set upon this touching and beautiful devotion?",
  "29833": "And the result of the examination?",
  "29834": "His ELDER brother?",
  "29835": "Perhaps he was expected to utter certain words?",
  "29836": "Supposing he is loyal, can any of his requests be granted, and if any, which of them?",
  "29837": "Are you sure you are more reasonable?",
  "29838": "Shall I go in first?",
  "29839": "What will you warm yourself with this winter?",
  "29840": "How is it they come to you?",
  "29841": "What have you got there?",
  "29842": "Have you your carriage?",
  "29843": "Do you think that you will catch anything?",
  "29844": "What is she lying down for?",
  "29845": "Who said she knew him?",
  "29846": "How do you find yourself this morning, sir?",
  "29847": "And what would you call this?",
  "29848": "How think you of that?",
  "29849": "Does she?",
  "29850": "What is that water?",
  "29851": "Going on?",
  "29852": "What palace may it deck?",
  "29853": "Reversed?",
  "29854": "Are you going to sit down, or are you not?",
  "29855": "Were you ever there?",
  "29856": "Do you see what a villain he is?",
  "29857": "And yet, when I was at my father's, did not the men give up their gayest balls and parties in order to pass the evening with me?",
  "29858": "But I want to know why the word 'moor' should have been written?",
  "29859": "We sent you wine?",
  "29860": "When did you get the letter?",
  "29861": "What is indispensable to you?",
  "29862": "What have I said?",
  "29863": "But how could you be sure I would know it?",
  "29864": "Tell me, I entreat of you, who and what you are?",
  "29865": "Had he not seduced his sisters, one after the other?",
  "29866": "Might I speak to you with regard to that matter of his grace, sir?",
  "29867": "Must I close this?",
  "29868": "The world is surely not worth living in now, is it?",
  "29869": "And was this the man?",
  "29870": "What's the time?",
  "29871": "What's queer?",
  "29872": "What house will they take?",
  "29873": "May the man who denies it rest his assertion upon such general considerations as that satisfaction presupposes desire, and that desire implies a lack, and, hence, pain?",
  "29874": "Was it well?",
  "29875": "Could it be done?",
  "29876": "Why should I stand in a comrade's way?",
  "29877": "What have you done with that gentleman against whom you had the audacity, about twelve days ago, to make an accusation of passing false money?",
  "29878": "What else should I stay on for?",
  "29879": "What beings surround me?",
  "29880": "What judgment?",
  "29881": "How could I offend a man who was charitable enough to sit at my bedside a good hour, and talk on some other subject than pills and draughts, blisters and leeches?",
  "29882": "D'Epinay?",
  "29883": "Are you certain of what you say, monsieur?",
  "29884": "And the reason is that each part of him is doing its own business, whether in ruling or being ruled?",
  "29885": "You want it, I expect?",
  "29886": "Had he been fooled once more?",
  "29887": "Do you seriously believe that that machine has travelled into time?",
  "29888": "What says our graver sister?",
  "29889": "But when these different reflections and observations concur in establishing the same conclusion, must they not bestow an undisputed evidence upon it?",
  "29890": "Can I do anything?",
  "29891": "What passage is that?",
  "29892": "But does she now dissolve the union?",
  "29893": "Any way out of that yard, now?",
  "29894": "Have those who have had their share in oligarchies been peculiarly wise and peculiarly devoted to the common good?",
  "29895": "What was there to be done in the village?",
  "29896": "What should I tell?",
  "29897": "Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad?",
  "29898": "To what purpose?",
  "29899": "And if it is labor that creates wealth and legitimates property, how explain the consumption of the idler?",
  "29900": "What did you mean by that?",
  "29901": "Well, what do YOU make of it?",
  "29902": "Are there any?",
  "29903": "And if I refuse to retract, you wish to fight, do you?",
  "29904": "Dora, what has happened to you?",
  "29905": "Where have you been sleeping all this week?",
  "29906": "But what do you gather from it?",
  "29907": "Then how could you know?",
  "29908": "Are you much hurt?",
  "29909": "Daunted?",
  "29910": "And why should you try to deceive me by telling a tale?",
  "29911": "Can I come, with my doll?",
  "29912": "Yes my boy?",
  "29913": "Had it not been for this utter stranger, they had succeeded, for who would have accepted my unsupported word against the damning evidence of those cards hidden on my person?",
  "29914": "Why this man saved and that man lost?",
  "29915": "How has my judgment wander'd?",
  "29916": "And is not all true virtue the companion of wisdom, no matter what fears or pleasures or other similar goods or evils may or may not attend her?",
  "29917": "You know what I mean?",
  "29918": "What, sweetheart?",
  "29919": "What sort of a place is it?",
  "29920": "Well, I vow, that's what the sea folks call sailing UNDER BARE POLES, come true, aint it?",
  "29921": "Who took his hands out of mine?",
  "29922": "I insist upon your living, do you hear?",
  "29923": "Why on earth did you ask him to dine with us?",
  "29924": "Was she sheering off?",
  "29925": "What say your old men?",
  "29926": "Are not the quail, the pigeon and the partridge the natural prey of the hawk?",
  "29927": "From the country, I see, sir?",
  "29928": "Would prudence or gratitude allow the pontiffs to renounce their benefactor?",
  "29929": "Why must their ruffs be always crinkled like endive leaves, and not crimped with a crimping iron?",
  "29930": "To whom is it they should have recourse?",
  "29931": "But who is there that ever heard of such an instinct?",
  "29932": "Well, but what am I to do?",
  "29933": "Subdivide?",
  "29934": "What is the colour of the men?",
  "29935": "What's the pay?",
  "29936": "Because I sigh when thinking of some one I am leaving?",
  "29937": "Whom did you play with?",
  "29938": "Do they work worse?",
  "29939": "You're not worried about anything?",
  "29940": "Are you sure you know the way?",
  "29941": "Why not make him a doctor like his father?",
  "29942": "But what was that to her, or to any one but myself?",
  "29943": "A little fancy work?",
  "29944": "Then again, if a woman and her lover conspire to murder a husband, are they going to advertise their guilt by ostentatiously removing his wedding ring after his death?",
  "29945": "Where are you off to?",
  "29946": "What's set you a snivelling now?",
  "29947": "And who is to do the parish work?",
  "29948": "Are you well fed?",
  "29949": "How many years do you mean to live after I am gone?",
  "29950": "What could these people do?",
  "29951": "Do you think I would leave you?",
  "29952": "And what do you call all this?",
  "29953": "Is it anything bad?",
  "29954": "Is it of course?",
  "29955": "But now what?",
  "29956": "Where is it?",
  "29957": "Would these two travellers make much difference to the horses, if we took them with us?",
  "29958": "Shall we not bear the trials of life a little longer in patience?",
  "29959": "How can they recognize you, if you act in such a manner that no one can recognize you?",
  "29960": "What is it you smell of?",
  "29961": "Forgotten, indeed?",
  "29962": "Were you at the performance last evening?",
  "29963": "How have you got on?",
  "29964": "Paying the money, I suppose?",
  "29965": "May one venture to ask you, monsieur, on what you have reflected?",
  "29966": "Are you, then, a coward?",
  "29967": "Would it not be safer and more certain if I should ask him his name and tell him yours?",
  "29968": "Why, how did he come here, mother?",
  "29969": "Why do you say that, when you are going to this terrible war, and he is so old?",
  "29970": "Under what law, and for what offence?",
  "29971": "Easily?",
  "29972": "Why did he not take her in his arms and swear that he would never leave her?",
  "29973": "DID you hear that?",
  "29974": "Is the committee willing to hear this witness?",
  "29975": "Would you care for it?",
  "29976": "Who will be waiting for me beyond the ditch?",
  "29977": "May I?",
  "29978": "What is the stone called?",
  "29979": "Now, sir, tell me who and what that woman was?",
  "29980": "Are you one?",
  "29981": "Married?",
  "29982": "Will that do now?",
  "29983": "How shall I put it on?",
  "29984": "And to what purpose?",
  "29985": "Mouston?",
  "29986": "How is your dear mother getting on?",
  "29987": "Why did we choose it, this foolish task?",
  "29988": "Are you an alienist?",
  "29989": "Cannot ate it?",
  "29990": "You are, I imagine, still of the same opinion?",
  "29991": "Or not you so much, perhaps, as your friend in the city?",
  "29992": "Did you ask her how much?",
  "29993": "Is there no force on this side of the creek?",
  "29994": "If I guess rightly, will you confess it?",
  "29995": "Did you ever hear a definition of fame, sir?",
  "29996": "Ay, but how shall we know the catchpole?",
  "29997": "What harm is there in that?",
  "29998": "Why are there men and women that while they are nigh me the sunlight expands my blood?",
  "29999": "Why, according to popular belief is it rather characterised by the very contrary?",
  "30000": "Shall we hold it as a province and govern it by despotic power?",
  "30001": "My dear doctor, what is my wife's complaint?",
  "30002": "Do we go all the way today?",
  "30003": "Oh, what does that matter?",
  "30004": "What place was there in her mind for a remonstrance to lodge in?",
  "30005": "Really and truly?",
  "30006": "If that were so, what had become of my father?",
  "30007": "But where is the last year's snow?",
  "30008": "How much will you ask to stay with her till the end?",
  "30009": "Can the heart become misshapen and contract incurable deformities and infirmities under the oppression of a disproportionate unhappiness, as the vertebral column beneath too low a vault?",
  "30010": "What can it be?",
  "30011": "Of whom are you jealous, now?",
  "30012": "What was the sense of that?",
  "30013": "I felt very ignorant, but what could I do?",
  "30014": "And what are you going to do with yourself now, if I may ask?",
  "30015": "What interest of hers was affected by the treaty?",
  "30016": "An order to who?",
  "30017": "Which is the stronger, the small stick that first PRODUCES the fire, or the fire itself?",
  "30018": "So you've been at the club?",
  "30019": "Has he been a good soldier except the desertion?",
  "30020": "Do you think not?",
  "30021": "What you mought call me?",
  "30022": "Full of hope?",
  "30023": "And who will go?",
  "30024": "Farther?",
  "30025": "Should he slip away after having come and peeped into the barricade?",
  "30026": "Perhaps?",
  "30027": "Very well, my dear sir, and how does that concern us?",
  "30028": "But will the wild ass submit to the bonds?",
  "30029": "Where is the count?",
  "30030": "A whole one, and in a candlestick?",
  "30031": "Are you?",
  "30032": "Are you going to remain as you are, dear princess?",
  "30033": "What might have been your opinion of the place?",
  "30034": "Who defeated it?",
  "30035": "Plantation hand?",
  "30036": "For us, also?",
  "30037": "What is to be done with them?",
  "30038": "What would the life of a man be if he could feel no fear or repulsion?",
  "30039": "Is it really so that I may understand you, sir?",
  "30040": "Well, dad, what do you say about it?",
  "30041": "Why did she love everything so tenderly and so passionately, everything living that was not a man?",
  "30042": "In favor of some member of your family?",
  "30043": "You are angry, monsieur?",
  "30044": "What, he told you so, I suppose?",
  "30045": "What, have they buried him in honour for his services to them?",
  "30046": "To stand from fear set free?",
  "30047": "You are aware, I suppose, that all mythology and poetry is a narration of events, either past, present, or to come?",
  "30048": "Why do you go, sir?",
  "30049": "You called my father 'Michael' as if you knew him well?",
  "30050": "This DETOUR has been entirely for our benefit, then?",
  "30051": "What do you tell me?",
  "30052": "What was she like now?",
  "30053": "Call the captain, and heave the ship aback?",
  "30054": "And did you observe any change in her then?",
  "30055": "Flee alone, and leave you here?",
  "30056": "Can I have lost it?",
  "30057": "Are the sacrifices I have made of honour and modesty to you no proof of my being tied to you in bonds too strong to be broken?",
  "30058": "But what makes you so much out of sorts?",
  "30059": "Why, wherefore stay you?",
  "30060": "Who asked him while I was away?",
  "30061": "Jarndyce?",
  "30062": "Why, what's the matter?",
  "30063": "What does it depend upon?",
  "30064": "Now will you learn not to answer back when I speak to you?",
  "30065": "And what you think of it?",
  "30066": "But, on the other hand, did not the people evince decided obstinacy and insubordination?",
  "30067": "And my making it easy for you to see the child?",
  "30068": "Has anyone an interest in preventing your arrival there?",
  "30069": "Do you abuse your teacher?",
  "30070": "Has it struck you that we may not now choose to give over?",
  "30071": "And how do you like the place?",
  "30072": "Why do you not sit by his side and begin talking to him and asking him questions?",
  "30073": "What have you got to be afraid of?",
  "30074": "What used he to say?",
  "30075": "Where the devil is mine?",
  "30076": "How do you feel yourself?",
  "30077": "That millions of others still exist, which are too minute for any observation?",
  "30078": "I suppose we might call her that?",
  "30079": "What's that to me?",
  "30080": "But you are sure you can act your part, and disguise your voice so that he may mistake that, as he has already mistaken your person?",
  "30081": "What would it matter if you smashed to smithereens at the end of the run, after a bust like that?",
  "30082": "Can someone have guessed our secret and dug up the watch?",
  "30083": "But what could he do but just let her see that he would make anything, everything, for her, as honourably easy as possible?",
  "30084": "How many cartridges did you say you had left?",
  "30085": "What then is worth being valued?",
  "30086": "What does this avail?",
  "30087": "This, then, was his father's residence?",
  "30088": "Fisher?",
  "30089": "How like you that answer?",
  "30090": "But what shall we do?",
  "30091": "If it is a friend, why does he not show himself?",
  "30092": "Who then must decide?",
  "30093": "Can we with propriety suffer them to be rulers?",
  "30094": "Have you been here long?",
  "30095": "How can they suit each other?",
  "30096": "Do you see these?",
  "30097": "How do you prove that?",
  "30098": "Arsenic?",
  "30099": "Now, sir, what have you to say to me?",
  "30100": "I suppose we're going to have a talk about this?",
  "30101": "Let 'em both wait?",
  "30102": "Perhaps you would not mind walking to town with me?",
  "30103": "Love had bandaged his eyes, in order to lead him whither?",
  "30104": "It is not my intention to detain the reader by expa?",
  "30105": "Why ask?",
  "30106": "Am I to read this?",
  "30107": "Who are you then?",
  "30108": "Was there nothing to fear?",
  "30109": "But did this man hope to conceal himself effectually behind that heap of rubbish, which one need but skirt?",
  "30110": "Then it all depends on that object that you regard, for your reasons, as evidence?",
  "30111": "What if there was no rank of life in which she could now properly attach herself?",
  "30112": "Why then do philosophers look for public spirit?",
  "30113": "How many would he have?",
  "30114": "But do you know this mysterious count is a bachelor?",
  "30115": "Why strive for a coherent, satisfied life?",
  "30116": "Intelligent you call yourselves, do you?",
  "30117": "Did men eat men?",
  "30118": "That is, he was not a boy at all, I suppose?",
  "30119": "Who knew what would have saved him?",
  "30120": "Could he not annul the verdict?",
  "30121": "How can something come out of nothing?",
  "30122": "And now, he said, what did we just now call that principle which repels the even?",
  "30123": "What is that error?",
  "30124": "I hurriedly made him a reply to the effect, that I hoped the error into which I had been betrayed by the desperate nature of my love, did not induce him to think me mercenary too?",
  "30125": "What is this place?",
  "30126": "Guy, is this amount of confidence to be our stock to start the new life on?",
  "30127": "How is your head, better?",
  "30128": "What matters that?",
  "30129": "The opportunity is a good one, then?",
  "30130": "But if, in spite of all my precautions, I am at last obliged to fight, will you not be my second?",
  "30131": "May I ask you to be so kind as to inquire of all your subjects if any of them have seen a fishing hook lost in the sea?",
  "30132": "And what is your business?",
  "30133": "Had I better wait till it's three o'clock?",
  "30134": "Why are you not eating anything, gentlemen?",
  "30135": "Does this not amount to your stealing the annual salary from your lord?",
  "30136": "Who'd you reckon?",
  "30137": "WILL IT BE COMMUNISM?",
  "30138": "Are you a married man, sir?",
  "30139": "What dream we of?",
  "30140": "What's the good of taking it in hand now?",
  "30141": "But if he does not come?",
  "30142": "Have you any idea what became of them?",
  "30143": "And why this ABSOLUTISM in the relations of capitalist and laborer?",
  "30144": "Is any man termed a gentleman, that is not always in the fashion?",
  "30145": "Do I ever leave you?",
  "30146": "Are you all of the same opinion?",
  "30147": "Whose was this mighty personality?",
  "30148": "Perhaps you could name the figures of a few wiolincellers of a good tone?",
  "30149": "To marrying whom?",
  "30150": "Am I wrong to come up here to see her?",
  "30151": "You heard my question?",
  "30152": "Why now should I be tempted?",
  "30153": "Where's my maid?",
  "30154": "You're able to read?",
  "30155": "What has he lived on since?",
  "30156": "And you resent it?",
  "30157": "Kennedy was preparing to discharge all his batteries into the middle of the ascending multitude, but what could he have done against such a numberless army?",
  "30158": "Was it not rather a service and a kindly act?",
  "30159": "How could there be when it's barely ten o'clock yet?",
  "30160": "And have you got a paper?",
  "30161": "Where is the girl who promised to marry any one who would release her brother?",
  "30162": "And all arithmetic and calculation have to do with number?",
  "30163": "How do you happen to be here?",
  "30164": "And what is the result?",
  "30165": "And for what have you ruined your life, if you come to think of it?",
  "30166": "Who talks of cadeaux?",
  "30167": "But did you not read that I must be alone?",
  "30168": "Do you find the prisoner guilty or not guilty?",
  "30169": "And he who does not possess and is therefore unable to impart this conception, in whatever degree he fails, may in that degree also be said to fail in intelligence?",
  "30170": "But what's happened to you?",
  "30171": "Are you lost or have the wolves eaten you?",
  "30172": "Why should I still be subject to these visitations of the devil, when I try so hard to keep him away?",
  "30173": "How do you know what I think?",
  "30174": "But why was the tear in her eye?",
  "30175": "Are you lonesome because you're a magician?",
  "30176": "What had taken place during those ten months?",
  "30177": "You accuse him, then?",
  "30178": "What has anybody to do with that?",
  "30179": "Was I wrong in claiming that confusion reigned among legists, and ought I to be legally prosecuted for having said that their science henceforth stood convicted of falsehood, its glory eclipsed?",
  "30180": "John, which way must we now turn?",
  "30181": "Was I not right?",
  "30182": "Why so breathless a start?",
  "30183": "And have we, at our age, been earnestly discoursing with one another all our life long only to discover that we are no better than children?",
  "30184": "Do you want to go with us?",
  "30185": "Who had taken the letters, if letters there were?",
  "30186": "At any rate, they are all reconciled to it now, I hope?",
  "30187": "And they will place them under the command of experienced veterans who will be their leaders and teachers?",
  "30188": "Even the spiritual vision, is it not at all points arrested by the continuous golden walls of the universe?",
  "30189": "What can you be dreaming of?",
  "30190": "You say again you are quite sure that it was the prisoner?",
  "30191": "Is it any new trouble?",
  "30192": "And talking about the hospital?",
  "30193": "Amid what elegancies of carved furniture, decorated walls, elaborate tapestries did they move?",
  "30194": "If they are really qualified for the task, will not their own hearts be the first to inform them of it?",
  "30195": "What sort of life were that to live?",
  "30196": "What's your trade?",
  "30197": "How could I have been so beguiled?",
  "30198": "How does I talk wild?",
  "30199": "Would we be done for?",
  "30200": "Come, now, my learned friend, what makes you hesitate?",
  "30201": "You have come far?",
  "30202": "But is she not awfully rich?",
  "30203": "Who can make good coffee?",
  "30204": "So we had better leave you?",
  "30205": "Is the downstairs door fast?",
  "30206": "Or if he is to be governed, how can he be governed well?",
  "30207": "Will you have tea here then, or go across to the house, where there's a tent on the lawn?",
  "30208": "Did you observe the colour?",
  "30209": "Can it be?",
  "30210": "Will this assist in explaining the difficulty?",
  "30211": "Is not my son hungry?",
  "30212": "You are sure of your enterprise?",
  "30213": "Have you been at the concert?",
  "30214": "What about her horse?",
  "30215": "Mamma, what am I to say to him?",
  "30216": "When is your turn to come?",
  "30217": "Had I thus come in vain into these forests and mountains?",
  "30218": "Do you call that nothing?",
  "30219": "What is it, then, which does judge about them?",
  "30220": "Shall I lend you a hand here?",
  "30221": "Damn you, what do you mean by that?",
  "30222": "And who's that tall chap standing beside her?",
  "30223": "Would any one deny this?",
  "30224": "Did they impose on each industry a proportional tax, so as to preserve a balance in the market?",
  "30225": "What should you do in my place?",
  "30226": "What more could one ask for?",
  "30227": "For who can change men's opinions?",
  "30228": "Would a painter be any the worse because, after having delineated with consummate art an ideal of a perfectly beautiful man, he was unable to show that any such man could ever have existed?",
  "30229": "Have you decided?",
  "30230": "How is your father getting on?",
  "30231": "Were those great, stony cliffs the gates of paradise?",
  "30232": "Shall our rivers and harbors be improved?",
  "30233": "But how do you make it shine through the walls?",
  "30234": "What, do you want to leave us?",
  "30235": "Do you stand me out, mistress?",
  "30236": "How is the poor woman?",
  "30237": "Or, that she should prefer the rant of flattery to the simple accents of sincerity?",
  "30238": "Are you a gentleman?",
  "30239": "Did you speak?",
  "30240": "Shall I see you again before your departure?",
  "30241": "And how are the other people getting on?",
  "30242": "Why should I not go?",
  "30243": "And if they are not fortifying, sire?",
  "30244": "But hark, what music is that?",
  "30245": "What do you suppose they would do to a man disarmed like me?",
  "30246": "Are you really frightened, madame?",
  "30247": "What are you doing, you stupid creature?",
  "30248": "Who will undertake it, if it be not also a service of honour?",
  "30249": "What have you heard?",
  "30250": "But as for me, what solace had I when the days of my fighting were done?",
  "30251": "You were not unfortunate, and yet you are an orphan, fatherless and motherless?",
  "30252": "Would not that have been better evidence?",
  "30253": "Where was my head when I made that grant?",
  "30254": "How will she take it?",
  "30255": "And you order me to announce you to the duchess?",
  "30256": "What more has happened?",
  "30257": "Why did you not tell me, instead of teasing me like this?",
  "30258": "Judah told you?",
  "30259": "So far we are within the bounds of possibility, are we not?",
  "30260": "Will the train soon be in?",
  "30261": "What is your opinion?",
  "30262": "How was it, having so little in reality to conceal, that I always DID feel as if this man were finding me out?",
  "30263": "What I wanted, who can say?",
  "30264": "And pray how do I and these my friends around me seem to you?",
  "30265": "Ah, are you composing poetry, queen?",
  "30266": "What is the use of being exquisite if you are not seen by the best judges?",
  "30267": "Then what was the use of our coming?",
  "30268": "Why do you disappoint me so?",
  "30269": "Are you a child or a teetotum?",
  "30270": "Take head?",
  "30271": "The date?",
  "30272": "Would I do him this favour?",
  "30273": "Do you mind if I go in and tell this man to come on to us when he's finished here?",
  "30274": "Is it in this particular part, or in that other?",
  "30275": "Are you ready to get back the trade on those terms?",
  "30276": "To what does your ambition aspire?",
  "30277": "And all complaining, accusing?",
  "30278": "Is she like me?",
  "30279": "What, none of you?",
  "30280": "You will fulfill your promise to me?",
  "30281": "What sort of animal is this interest?",
  "30282": "You must have known that?",
  "30283": "Was it not I?",
  "30284": "And am I dishonest?",
  "30285": "What's the letter?",
  "30286": "Would it please you to accompany her upon the lake?",
  "30287": "Ladies and gentlemen, what is your opinion on the subject?",
  "30288": "What do you want, sir?",
  "30289": "And where can a man seek ends of any sort beyond this broad field?",
  "30290": "How came you to make such a mistake as this?",
  "30291": "Is it too late?",
  "30292": "How do you feel now?",
  "30293": "Anne, did YOU put sugar in these peas?",
  "30294": "That is to say, justice is useful when money is useless?",
  "30295": "Is not this second infinite, so to speak, subjacent to the first?",
  "30296": "And he said nothing as he died?",
  "30297": "WHO forbade you?",
  "30298": "Gallia out of place?",
  "30299": "And am I not ready to do so again?",
  "30300": "Frightened of what?",
  "30301": "Where do we go first?",
  "30302": "Where are you?",
  "30303": "How did you get yourself into this mess?",
  "30304": "It is not in your possession?",
  "30305": "Will your excellency give your name, or remain incognito?",
  "30306": "Legal proceedings to prevent payment?",
  "30307": "Have you any sort of conveyance?",
  "30308": "I suppose you kissed his hand?",
  "30309": "What's in it?",
  "30310": "How dare you look into this garden?",
  "30311": "How find a straight road of progress, you men of science, of industry, of cooperation, of trades unions, and all the rest?",
  "30312": "Really?",
  "30313": "Is this gentle and lovely being lost forever?",
  "30314": "Weigh out tragedy, like butcher's meat?",
  "30315": "Happy?",
  "30316": "What mingles in the strain?",
  "30317": "What can that be, monsieur le chevalier?",
  "30318": "Why do you seek me?",

  "30374": "Why are you wandering about like an outcast?",
  "30375": "But, miss, you will hear one word?",
  "30376": "And to go to the root of the matter, why are you so positively convinced that not to act against his real normal interests guaranteed by the conclusions of reason and arithmetic is certainly always advantageous for man and must always be a law for mankind?",

  "30719": "Did it move, did it float on the surface of the ocean, or did it dive into its depths?",
  "30720": "Reasonable well, I give you thanks, wont you alight?",
  "30721": "Do the gentlemen say so?",
  "30722": "Beasts, did you say?",
  "30723": "Who is coming to tea?",
  "30724": "Put an end?",
  "30725": "How can I tell him to be sober when I have been a beast all my life?",
  "30726": "If free, would he attempt to fly, or would he remain?",
  "30727": "They're not far from here, then?",
  "30728": "Were you a steward or a stoker in those days?",
  "30729": "Is it true that force and right are necessarily on the same side in republican governments?",
  "30730": "Are you aware how small his means are, and of the straitened circumstances of his widow?",
  "30731": "My own?",
  "30732": "It was to meet him here that you came?",
  "30733": "Had he not cause for triumph?",
  "30734": "Will you hear me?",
  "30735": "Never more to be separated?",
  "30736": "What disguise do you propose to adopt?",
  "30737": "How was that managed?",
  "30738": "Is it not so, my friends?",
  "30739": "And he has accepted the call?",
  "30740": "How long have you been cooling your eye there?",
  "30741": "What name go you by?",
  "30742": "And what truth?",
  "30743": "Yes, where is this letter?",
  "30744": "Where away, cook?",
  "30745": "And with regard to the past?",
  "30746": "A deanery for her brother in the church?",
  "30747": "What shall we have, said he, to drink in these deserts?",
  "30748": "Is there any collective action which cannot find its justification in political unity, in patriotism, in the balance of power, or in civilization?",
  "30749": "Lady, when was it that your heart was there?",
  "30750": "Where is humanity?",
  "30751": "Where did he live, then?",
  "30752": "What have I done?",
  "30753": "Whom do you wish to speak about?",
  "30754": "You remain near this part?",
  "30755": "Pray what is your own theory as to what took place?",
  "30756": "What?",
  "30757": "She would smile on me, she would say a word to me, would that do any harm to any one?",
  "30758": "How are you, dear child?",
  "30759": "What origin do they attribute to these rifts?",
  "30760": "Do you think I am not grateful?",
  "30761": "WHAT did you see her doing?",
  "30762": "Under these circumstances, was it perfectly certain that no danger could accrue?",
  "30763": "Why should society work out an extraordinary system of rewards for those whom it is already rewarding automatically?",
  "30764": "If, secondly, the question is asked whether this being is substance, whether it is of the greatest reality, whether it is necessary, and so forth?",
  "30765": "How could I wait so long?",
  "30766": "Well, have I convinced you?",
  "30767": "Oh, where am I to go?",
  "30768": "You will not let me speak?",
  "30769": "Nothing, I suppose?",
  "30770": "And if they were pleased, would that make them immortal?",
  "30771": "What do they say to this?",
  "30772": "What design has the cardinal upon you to make him so generous?",
  "30773": "Is it indeed so?",
  "30774": "How came you to be walking here?",
  "30775": "There is the other service, the old one, that which belonged to my husband?",
  "30776": "A room just above?",
  "30777": "Will their successors falter and plead organic impotency in the nation?",
  "30778": "Now what do you think?",
  "30779": "It is in my power, think you, to make such a change at demand?",
  "30780": "It will have pity?",
  "30781": "What can I propose?",
  "30782": "Should I not be disingenuously serving my own ends?",
  "30783": "How is bread made?",
  "30784": "Do you recall him?",
  "30785": "Landlords?",
  "30786": "Should they ever again find themselves in the midst of their friends, or seated at the domestic hearth?",
  "30787": "To lead me to my death, is that enough?",
  "30788": "What use am I to make of your instruction?",
  "30789": "Where?",
  "30790": "Shall we, then, establish it for a general maxim, that no refined or elaborate reasoning is ever to be received?",
  "30791": "How did you get such big big hips?",
  "30792": "How about me?",
  "30793": "Oh?",
  "30794": "Is it deemed a holy place in the land, then?",
  "30795": "The king has not signed, however?",
  "30796": "Why the delay of a reargument?",
  "30797": "But how do you know?",
  "30798": "Should I ever meet you there?",
  "30799": "But if he did marry her in spite of the threat?",
  "30800": "Did I say a peach?",
  "30801": "What has happened since then to give you a completely new idea of the case?",
  "30802": "Has a young man, such as I am, gone through this morning, then?",
  "30803": "What am I to say, indoors?",
  "30804": "How did he evolve his ethics?",
  "30805": "Have you seen the thief?",
  "30806": "Do virtuous men, in so far as they are virtuous, stand in each other's light?",
  "30807": "Shall we bathe this morning?",
  "30808": "What's the matter now, ma'am?",
  "30809": "And is no allowance to be made for inadvertence, or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment?",
  "30810": "Or is it actual?",
  "30811": "How does she look?",
  "30812": "Married another?",
  "30813": "Do with him?",
  "30814": "And what may his name be, coptain?",
  "30815": "You might have stayed away, I suppose, if you would?",
  "30816": "Brown, convicted of mutinous conduct and sentenced to death?",
  "30817": "Who will become the sharer of this dangerous secret?",
  "30818": "What is the gift of conquest but safety?",
  "30819": "French, eh?",
  "30820": "Is he too so very remarkable?",
  "30821": "Who do you think is going to be married tomorrow?",
  "30822": "Both, on the other hand, had joined pretty gaily in the conversation, for why should they interrupt it?",
  "30823": "I regulate my watch?",
  "30824": "Do you hear, sir?",
  "30825": "How can girls like to have lovers and refuse them?",
  "30826": "Have you finished tea?",
  "30827": "What like was she?",
  "30828": "Has anything extraordinary happened to you?",
  "30829": "Who made this gruel here?",
  "30830": "And where are they?",
  "30831": "If you had been born such, would you have been here now?",
  "30832": "But how do you come here?",
  "30833": "But I wonder is it so very nice?",
  "30834": "Did it hurt you much?",
  "30835": "On what principle, then, shall we any longer choose justice rather than the worst injustice?",
  "30836": "Do you reckon YOU can learn 'em anything?",
  "30837": "What do I read here?",
  "30838": "What woman can before her husband?",
  "30839": "Who has the right to dictate to my conscience, and where did he get that right?",
  "30840": "Is she coming, and open, free?",
  "30841": "By your orders?",
  "30842": "To dig the foundations out from under that cabin with?",
  "30843": "My dear child, how can I help minding?",
  "30844": "Is this so?",
  "30845": "You'll make up for it by making another?",
  "30846": "Bubbles?",
  "30847": "Are you willing to endure to the last, and not once attempt a repayment?",
  "30848": "What are they, my dear friend?",
  "30849": "I hope you think so?",
  "30850": "But why on earth should it bother him?",
  "30851": "I wonder whether I've done well in advising that amusement?",
  "30852": "Had I?",
  "30853": "Jack?",
  "30854": "What means can I take to introduce it to the world?",
  "30855": "And so it came about that the young rat did see a good deal of the world, but how?",
  "30856": "But they will contest the will after your death?",
  "30857": "Walks by night, does she?",
  "30858": "And who is it to belong to?",
  "30859": "Is that enough?",
  "30860": "What about souls?",
  "30861": "But what have you been doing?",
  "30862": "Do we need common sense and fairness in our regulations?",
  "30863": "Oh, who does not desire to dwell forever and forever in that city of love and light when the pains and sorrows, the trials and tears, of this weary life are over?",
  "30864": "Have you let your lodgings, ma'am?",
  "30865": "Ought we to rank this one species with bears, and what should we do with the other species?",
  "30866": "Were you not engaged in it then?",
  "30867": "How do you know that, sir?",
  "30868": "Is it conscious?",
  "30869": "What do you know on the subject?",
  "30870": "And what, pray, is your idea of the duties of a devoted friend?",
  "30871": "Who can desire it more than I?",
  "30872": "What would you propose doing?",
  "30873": "What chance have I?",
  "30874": "What were his charms?",
  "30875": "Why should they not work for a uniform minimum of labour conditions through all their communities?",
  "30876": "So he has turned you out?",
  "30877": "Come for long?",
  "30878": "By the way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from?",
  "30879": "Why should he be so mean now?",
  "30880": "DO with it?",
  "30881": "Ask you what provocation I have had?",
  "30882": "Not know the thing which my own eyes beheld?",
  "30883": "Anything else?",
  "30884": "Will you taste for yourself?",
  "30885": "It's not a very nice night to be out, is it?",
  "30886": "You'll come and meet me as usual, girls?",
  "30887": "Now, had I come upon a hopeless incompatibility?",
  "30888": "Do you know what you're doing?",
  "30889": "Quite a vineyard, hey?",
  "30890": "Do I flatter myself if I allow myself to look at it in that way?",
  "30891": "Have I done right?",
  "30892": "He's all right?",
  "30893": "How can I ever thank you for all the deep obligations you impose upon me every day?",
  "30894": "Ought we not to make something great out of a youth, under twenty, who has, in the highest degree, quickness to conceive and courage to execute?",
  "30895": "Was there no loophole of escape?",
  "30896": "I suppose we must take the shapes of beasts?",
  "30897": "What are you surprised at?",
  "30898": "What did they matter when he played divinely?",
  "30899": "Tell me the why of this?",
  "30900": "But is it that makes you go?",
  "30901": "Will you graciously let me kiss your hand?",
  "30902": "Who are you to ask me my business?",
  "30903": "But does not this question make a disturbance outside of political circles?",
  "30904": "What influence can I possibly have over a bandit?",
  "30905": "Is there a carriage at the door?",
  "30906": "Do you still wish to do so?",
  "30907": "At all events, what use was there in delaying?",
  "30908": "And what right had she to be cross?",
  "30909": "What's the good, if you're sick with love for him?",
  "30910": "How should you?",
  "30911": "Is that fine, keen edge upon your soul that gives such avidity for holy things?",
  "30912": "What of the resemblance?",
  "30913": "Why a locksmiths' association in a village?",
  "30914": "Or must I fly the country altogether?",
  "30915": "What would have been the result?",
  "30916": "Back at last?",
  "30917": "What else could this fragment be but the sole surviving remnant of some sumptuous mansion that once had stood on this unrivaled site?",
  "30918": "In relation to what objects?",
  "30919": "You WERE afraid?",
  "30920": "Do you think I am deceiving you?",
  "30921": "How can you know what he is?",
  "30922": "What were you eating there all by yourself for your dinner?",
  "30923": "Are you going to sail in?",
  "30924": "Wonder if you'll ever drag me up there?",
  "30925": "Is there any need to hurry, sir?",
  "30926": "Still I ask you, what is this to me?",
  "30927": "And leave the litter as it is?",
  "30928": "Do you advance with him?",
  "30929": "So perhaps I shall rub on?",
  "30930": "In front or behind?",
  "30931": "And by what authority?",
  "30932": "Yea, what then?",
  "30933": "I really could not say?",
  "30934": "And does he imagine that the coadjutor will put himself out for him?",
  "30935": "Do you think she will ever forget that her son is her safeguard, her shield, the pledge for her dignity, for her fortune and her life?",
  "30936": "You said prince, did you not?",
  "30937": "Was it worth it?",
  "30938": "What young ladies?",
  "30939": "Shall we turn back?",
  "30940": "At the end of your name stands for?",
  "30941": "Is it not time to decide finally the meaning of the gift of the great fortune now all in your hand, and growing?",
  "30942": "Well, are we going to stand here all day?",
  "30943": "Who would not acknowledge that a poor man or woman, fain to earn daily bread by the sweat of the brow, is far more reprehensible in yielding to the solicitations of love, than a rich lady, whose life is lapped in ease and unrestricted luxury?",
  "30944": "Have we reached the limits of what reason can supply?",
  "30945": "What should I say?",
  "30946": "Did you ever, O king, hear a cat purring over a bowl of broth, or the buzzing of beetles in the twilight, or a shrill tongued old woman scolding your head off?",
  "30947": "What will gladden your heart?",
  "30948": "Are you sure it will be the last time?",
  "30949": "What is that for a man to do?",
  "30950": "Since when?",
  "30951": "Why, soldiers, why?",
  "30952": "How came you to read some of those queerer ones?",
  "30953": "Did you not love your husband either?",
  "30954": "Where is true peace or true glory?",
  "30955": "How is it now?",
  "30956": "Durys?",
  "30957": "Has the reality of them ever been perceived by you through the bodily organs?",
  "30958": "Which girls should love?",
  "30959": "When was it?",
  "30960": "Does it belong to anybody in the neighbourhood?",
  "30961": "Has anything happened?",
  "30962": "Did you hit her?",
  "30963": "Is there any signal for the general rally?",
  "30964": "About what age is he?",
  "30965": "And why did I come here?",
  "30966": "What mercy can you expect from the man whom you have wronged?",
  "30967": "Have I taken an oath of some sort, then?",
  "30968": "Shall we say, in such a case, that the will of the majority was for the ultimate end?",
  "30969": "Where what?",
  "30970": "You say?",
  "30971": "Do you no longer like to think of your mother?",
  "30972": "What are you doing?",
  "30973": "May I understand, sir, that you threat is withdrawn, and that my income is secure?",
  "30974": "Are the two so deeply separated in this town, that there is no place whatever for an honest workman between them?",
  "30975": "Why then should a man cling to a longer stay here?",
  "30976": "The symptoms are marked, do you see?",
  "30977": "Whether fate, whose circle surrounds us, exercises a control over our liberty so imperious and compulsory that infractions of the law, committed under the dominion of antinomies, cease to be imputable to us?",
  "30978": "But supposing we had the authority, I would ask what good can result from the examination?",
  "30979": "What am I coming for?",
  "30980": "But settled?",
  "30981": "Did I like his voice?",
  "30982": "How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor?",
  "30983": "Who to?",
  "30984": "And the girl?",
  "30985": "Well, have you had a good hunt, have you botanised successfully?",
  "30986": "And why should you want to spite her?",
  "30987": "What did you pick me up for?",
  "30988": "And what does 'in my name' mean?",
  "30989": "Have you ever seen it?",
  "30990": "When, then, did father and son exchange shields, and why?",
  "30991": "Would he have been justified in sacrificing his own child, even if he could thereby save another's?",
  "30992": "Why are you only laying one place?",
  "30993": "Loves him?",
  "30994": "Yet who are the folk whom you find HERE?",
  "30995": "Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?",
  "30996": "Who is coming in here?",
  "30997": "What was she going to say, and what reply would she get?",
  "30998": "Can you tell me how to go about getting on the stage?",
  "30999": "What was your idea, then?",
  "31000": "Running from what?",
  "31001": "Valdemar?",
  "31002": "How are you going to manage to get out?",
  "31003": "Have you a portmanteau?",
  "31004": "What does it matter?",
  "31005": "What depth have we now reached?",
  "31006": "What the deuse do we men go to school for?",
  "31007": "If it be called swamp or sky?",
  "31008": "How the devil is he so like?",
  "31009": "Once more, will you undertake it?",
  "31010": "Are not these functions proper to the soul, and can they rightly be assigned to any other?",
  "31011": "How's this, dear niece?",
  "31012": "Do you know who that was?",
  "31013": "Was SHE at the ball too?",
  "31014": "And what made you ask it of me?",
  "31015": "Do you know that if we should ship, it would serve you quite right?",
  "31016": "Where are your wits?",
  "31017": "Is it possible, dear, that what I hear is true?",
  "31018": "No clue?",
  "31019": "Will you give me as far from the river as you can distinguish the belly of a horse?",
  "31020": "So what if he died, how did this concern the boy?",
  "31021": "Build I in the winds my dwelling?",
  "31022": "And what more free than he that desireth nothing upon earth?",
  "31023": "And you have them?",
  "31024": "Did I indeed, sir?",
  "31025": "And are greater miracles to be performed by those who do not follow his footsteps, who healed the body to reach the mind?",
  "31026": "And did I say there was any difficulty?",
  "31027": "Have I not got a brave determination of all my doubts, and a response in all things agreeable to the oracle that gave it?",
  "31028": "Could I leave the lady alone?",
  "31029": "Is it really?",
  "31030": "Do you think I'm not sufficiently ruining my health living here amid the continual emanations of the pharmacy?",
  "31031": "How should she be able to compose herself when she should first see him?",
  "31032": "But tell me, what would you have done?",
  "31033": "Confused?",
  "31034": "Wherefrom do they acquire these tendencies, these peculiarities?",
  "31035": "Who first seduced them to that foul revolt?",
  "31036": "If they want to jump down, now, and get into trouble, who objects?",
  "31037": "Do you regard that meaning as offensive?",
  "31038": "And why does the former operation end exactly when the latter commences?",
  "31039": "What is your notion?",
  "31040": "What now was my plain duty?",
  "31041": "But where can one jump to?",
  "31042": "And how were they?",
  "31043": "Who told you his name?",
  "31044": "Who and where is he?",
  "31045": "Shall we then raise cuckolds?",
  "31046": "But that I make no admissions?",
  "31047": "Am I deceived?",
  "31048": "What's the good of daylight now?",
  "31049": "Does any man ask himself what profit he has gained from the fulfilment of his dreams, if he must still endure, still undergo hunger and thirst and toil and trouble and care?",
  "31050": "What are the facts?",
  "31051": "Have you nothing to say to us?",
  "31052": "Can you tell when there is a good fire?",
  "31053": "What on earth will she say to me, I wonder?",
  "31054": "Did you anticipate the accident which has happened to your granddaughter?",
  "31055": "What cause had you to make discoveries of his pretended passion?",
  "31056": "Elopement?",
  "31057": "How shall I be able to endure life for thirteen years?",
  "31058": "How deeply sir, you apprehend it?",
  "31059": "Cake or bread and butter?",
  "31060": "Or might you have only travelled for your amusement?",
  "31061": "Who has not seen poor birds caught by their feet in the lime?",
  "31062": "I have seen you before, I think?",
  "31063": "Does not the practice of despoiling an enemy afford an excuse for not facing the battle?",
  "31064": "The place is then, as you know, determined on rebellion?",
  "31065": "And was that the upshot of my life's hardest battle?",
  "31066": "When did you shed tears over lost souls?",
  "31067": "Is it not horrible?",
  "31068": "On plantation?",
  "31069": "When you say it that way it sounds comical, does it not?",
  "31070": "What did you do with the girl?",
  "31071": "Who would want to injure us, or damage the projectile?",
  "31072": "How do you distinguish them?",
  "31073": "Haidee, would it please you not to leave me?",
  "31074": "In the name of the ninth day, what manner of creature are you?",
  "31075": "It is then a service which you propose to render us, count?",
  "31076": "Why a blue coat?",
  "31077": "Are you here for good?",
  "31078": "What was I telling you?",
  "31079": "Snakes?",
  "31080": "Ought she to shrink in this way from the long penance of life, which was all the possibility she had of lightening the load to some other sufferers, and so changing that passionate error into a new force of unselfish human love?",
  "31081": "May I ask you a question?",
  "31082": "And yet does not your honor fear to compromise yourself by allowing such a sum to be carried away for the service of your enemy?",
  "31083": "Then have we got to part?",
  "31084": "But what do you want to do with these chickens?",
  "31085": "Do you suggest that I should do that to a similarly garbed female?",
  "31086": "And if I do not read it, what shall you do, mamma?",
  "31087": "What is going on here?",
  "31088": "Can I see her first?",
  "31089": "And the profits are large?",
  "31090": "You let him go?",
  "31091": "How can he save them?",
  "31092": "Barkis, do you mean?",
  "31093": "All right, is it?",
  "31094": "Is that the sort of fellow?",
  "31095": "And that's all you want?",
  "31096": "Number of what, child?",
  "31097": "Well, now, when you orators get that off next year, and, may be, this very year, how would you like some old grizzled farmer to get up in the grove and deny it?",
  "31098": "Fluffed in his lines, did he?",
  "31099": "But was resistance and, in the last place, victory possible?",
  "31100": "Ought not a son to love his father, whatever happens?",
  "31101": "Why, you wished to have a talk with me when the others left?",
  "31102": "Have you ever heard anything particular respecting his birth?",
  "31103": "But how did we become engaged?",
  "31104": "Did this man belong to the double enigma of order and disorder?",
  "31105": "Then he has travelled?",
  "31106": "Will you not take my word?",

  "31178": "Why does the parent turn away from his child, and forbid him his presence for a time?",
  "31179": "What is a shame?",
  "31180": "And you ask me, whether I am an adherent of that church which maligns and damns you?",
  "31181": "You are rich?",

  "31897": "IS it?",
  "31898": "Which is the way home?",
  "31899": "Did you not hear the bell?",
  "31900": "And so you have resigned it?",
  "31901": "The place he wrote for, the place he died at, the place where you were taken to, and the place where he was buried?",
  "31902": "Is it less fertile?",
  "31903": "Is that all clear?",
  "31904": "A secret, perhaps?",
  "31905": "What rival?",
  "31906": "How does it hurt him?",
  "31907": "Fly?",
  "31908": "Then you are living with him still?",
  "31909": "The bank, the factory, or the house?",
  "31910": "What shall I understand that you mean by a bad name?",
  "31911": "Can you remember me?",
  "31912": "Have you been out?",
  "31913": "Why will he return to it?",
  "31914": "Such will be the change, and after the change has been made, how will they proceed?",
  "31915": "I am to be neutral?",
  "31916": "What would the countess have done had she not been able sometimes to scold the invalid for not strictly obeying the doctor's orders?",
  "31917": "Hallo, what's that?",
  "31918": "And what is it?",
  "31919": "What is love?",
  "31920": "How did it come to pass that their lips met?",
  "31921": "But to what do you attribute this conduct?",
  "31922": "Can it be that any of you tread that soil and forget the great purposes for which those men bravely fought, or nobly died?",
  "31923": "What was the notion?",
  "31924": "I wonder whether I have lost anything really?",
  "31925": "What news have you brought me?",
  "31926": "And had you a great many smart beaux there?",
  "31927": "Why is it that we can better bear to part in spirit than in body, and while we have the fortitude to act farewell have not the nerve to say it?",
  "31928": "About what?",
  "31929": "What on earth was I to do?",

  "31959": "Dogs' heads, eh?",
  "31960": "You think?",
  "31961": "Would you murder me?",
  "31962": "Where can I drive you?",
  "31963": "There, did I do all right?",
  "31964": "Why stay to imbibe this sweet poison that was corroding the very springs of my life?",
  "31965": "Where now shall we seek them?",
  "31966": "Does that astonish you, my boy?",
  "31967": "Are you educated and he ignorant, you high and he low, you refined and he coarse, you talented and he simple?",
  "31968": "Whom else?",
  "31969": "Would he ask for items?",
  "31970": "For the second time?",
  "31971": "Why do you men want so many boats?",
  "31972": "What's the use of bothering me with medicine?",

  "31980": "Was there any possible reason other than the one she gave?",
  "31981": "But what is to be done if the direct and sole vocation of every intelligent man is babble, that is, the intentional pouring of water through a sieve?",
  "31982": "What am I to write?",
  "31983": "Krook?",
  "31984": "Things for sale, or do you want to sell anything?",
  "31985": "Would the matter be carried as far as that?",
  "31986": "And what does she want the money for?",
  "31987": "Still leading his life of pleasure?",
  "31988": "Has he such might as to defy us all?",
  "31989": "What makes poor scoundrel rogues to beg, I pray you?",
  "31990": "You have nothing more to ask of me, my lord?",
  "31991": "Got a pin and a pencil, some of you?",
  "31992": "Against whom?",
  "31993": "Would you like fine horses, or it may be some one has offended you, and you would like his head?",
  "31994": "Wisdom, virtue, enlightenment?",
  "31995": "And what could they be talking about?",
  "31996": "And that which is opposed to them is one of the inferior principles of the soul?",
  "31997": "We may reply, and by what right do you demand payment from us for labor which we did not impose upon you?",
  "31998": "Is it necessary to change my frock?",
  "31999": "Do you confess that you were a wicked traitor?",
  "32000": "When did it take place?",
  "32001": "And, of course, the horse and cart were ready?",
  "32002": "That the strong bias of one decision would be apt to overrule the influence of any new lights which might be brought to vary the complexion of another decision?",
  "32003": "For who but the rich of this world can thus afford to fling pearls away?",
  "32004": "Suppose you catch it?",
  "32005": "And be merry?",
  "32006": "What are you about?",
  "32007": "What else?",
  "32008": "What's his name and address?",
  "32009": "How many times did he call upon his father?",
  "32010": "Did not the messenger say your father's safety depended upon it?",
  "32011": "Seeing then that the immortal is indestructible, must not the soul, if she is immortal, be also imperishable?",
  "32012": "Now, at once?",
  "32013": "Are we saved?",
  "32014": "Of what consequence to science is this interminable recital of crude facts, if your analysis never extracts a single idea from them?",
  "32015": "What, my dear, are you talking about?",
  "32016": "After all, who had seen him?",
  "32017": "From such beginning of governments, what could be expected but a continued system of war and extortion?",
  "32018": "And how much did they possess?",
  "32019": "Does he limit it to the few who did him the wrong, or does he take in the many?",
  "32020": "But why should I tell you all this?",
  "32021": "Do you think I will not listen to you?",
  "32022": "What link could there be between that creature and my wife?",
  "32023": "And do you think she is not there?",
  "32024": "The law?",
  "32025": "Will you go directly?",
  "32026": "Can it be that there remains to us only the recollection of them?",
  "32027": "Not even if they were kind to you?",
  "32028": "And who will help you?",
  "32029": "And were these four men attached to each other, true in heart, really united?",
  "32030": "Have you let it?",
  "32031": "Why does the soul still tarry in my body?",
  "32032": "Who has ever heard of such a marvelous place?",
  "32033": "But in heaven's name, tell me, what was that?",
  "32034": "Where did you hear it?",
  "32035": "Do you see?",
  "32036": "And now, prisoner, will you consent to tell your name?",
  "32037": "Is he accompanied?",
  "32038": "Yes, but how?",
  "32039": "What weight can my blood add to the wool?",
  "32040": "How did he die?",
  "32041": "Says I, father, what on airth are you at?",
  "32042": "May not this prove dangerous?",
  "32043": "How is it all the better?",
  "32044": "What dreadful thing will you do next?",
  "32045": "Is your wife at home?",
  "32046": "How did your tribute arise?",
  "32047": "Well, what are you doing here, and what is your name?",
  "32048": "What are you in such a hurry for?",
  "32049": "If you know my heart, then, can you not see that it is my heart I offer you?",
  "32050": "And yet how could it possibly be so?",
  "32051": "Well, are you so sure of the little gentleman?",
  "32052": "Was it you, sir?",
  "32053": "Have you noticed anything amiss with them of late?",
  "32054": "What purpose?",
  "32055": "What possessed him to do it?",
  "32056": "Or would you like another?",
  "32057": "You should sin less, and keep better in health?",
  "32058": "What advantage would it be to me to be anything else?",
  "32059": "Has your brother or the cat been meddling?",
  "32060": "Secondly, what are the best means, and the least expensive, for accomplishing those ends?",
  "32061": "Well, tell me, I have always wanted to know, did it hurt worse going in or coming out?",
  "32062": "Will I have eyes at the bottom of the sea, supposing I descend those endless stairs?",
  "32063": "Do you understand it at last?",
  "32064": "Now you quit it, do you hear?",
  "32065": "What is to be done now?",
  "32066": "Has she slept through it?",
  "32067": "Was there any idea at all connected with it?",
  "32068": "Is this the man?",
  "32069": "You will take something or other, surely?",
  "32070": "Did you stop there?",
  "32071": "And where did you get so much money?",
  "32072": "But they'll recognize you?",
  "32073": "Have you any message?",
  "32074": "May I come out to you in the garden presently?",
  "32075": "Where has she gone?",
  "32076": "But what's the idea of your new picture?",
  "32077": "But would it not be salutary to give also the means of preventing their commission?",
  "32078": "Have all gentlemen's servants warts upon their noses, mother?",
  "32079": "Bene curasti hoc jumentam?",
  "32080": "Who was right then?",
  "32081": "Why to me?",
  "32082": "Did you see what a fool he looked?",
  "32083": "Perhaps a dodge?",
  "32084": "What is it for?",
  "32085": "Cannot you stay a few minutes longer?",
  "32086": "Do you refuse this lady's hand whom I now offer you?",
  "32087": "Where are you going there?",
  "32088": "Your lordship will recall inquiring of me on the night of the ball as to the bona fides of one of the temporary waiters?",
  "32089": "Would you set a cloud to chase the wind?",
  "32090": "The strength one can eke from little, who knows till he has been subjected to the trial?",
  "32091": "Would you, my reader, like to be more gentle in your manner?",
  "32092": "You had your portfolio with you, then?",
  "32093": "What is the good of repentance like that?",
  "32094": "They are laying supper over there, are they?",
  "32095": "You have some in the house, have you not?",
  "32096": "Did he then love the rhythmic rise and fall of words better than their associations of legend and colour?",
  "32097": "Is not the most important problem that of getting the right man at the head of the company?",
  "32098": "Now, then, who can point out any sinless person in the present world?",
  "32099": "You are in love?",
  "32100": "WHAT IS IT?",
  "32101": "Shall I love all men, then, for the sake of one?",
  "32102": "How can they, he said, when they are not allowed to apply their minds to the callings of any of these?",
  "32103": "Are you really not to be persuaded, even now, to pass the night under my roof?",
  "32104": "What for, then?",
  "32105": "Is my husband's political career likely to suffer through this incident?",
  "32106": "Besides, where were these poor girls to go?",
  "32107": "Do you really think so?",
  "32108": "About what am I now employing my own soul?",
  "32109": "Do you speak by way of offence, sir?",
  "32110": "Why did you name them all with the same name?",
  "32111": "Well, I ask, what can the intervention of power, with the assistance of civil law and political economy, accomplish here?",
  "32112": "A bottle, perhaps?",
  "32113": "What do you expect to do in the midst of this darkness?",
  "32114": "And did she not even go to him?",
  "32115": "What other forces were arrayed?",
  "32116": "And why do they worry me so?",
  "32117": "What becomes, then, of the doctrine of expiation and abstinence, the morality of sacrifice, resignation, and happy moderation?",
  "32118": "If she makes up her mind to tell you, you will come and let me know, will you not?",
  "32119": "What is this rubbish?",
  "32120": "What is he doing there?",
  "32121": "Her name and family?",
  "32122": "What knave is this?",
  "32123": "But what did I know?",
  "32124": "Had he reached the point of forgetting the mayor's presence?",
  "32125": "Three?",
  "32126": "How could she do it, how can it be possible that she is a woman like that?",
  "32127": "Can we find any such connection in the case of a public work executed by a government?",
  "32128": "What sort of an entertainment, captain?",
  "32129": "How did he make it enter in?",
  "32130": "What do you reckon did it, boys?",
  "32131": "How do you help it?",
  "32132": "Is it not truly to clothe the naked, to procure for them a garment of light, a raiment of glory?",
  "32133": "Just give me one of those roses in the bunch you are wearing, will you?",
  "32134": "Harrison?",
  "32135": "Unless indeed you know me, and have some purpose in your brain?",
  "32136": "Is he conscious?",
  "32137": "Had his forms of expression changed, or his sentiments become less laudable?",
  "32138": "But what is it you wish?",
  "32139": "Why notice it?",
  "32140": "Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?",
  "32141": "On what charge?",
  "32142": "Is he not a handsome lad?",
  "32143": "Haue you hope of life?",
  "32144": "What is the remedy?",
  "32145": "You think so, do you?",
  "32146": "What would he himself say a couple of years after the event?",
  "32147": "How are you to act?",
  "32148": "Is it long since you came?",
  "32149": "By you?",
  "32150": "And will you let me play a few of your accompaniments?",
  "32151": "Sell my rapier?",
  "32152": "Is he prosperous and happy?",
  "32153": "Why will not people lend their money?",
  "32154": "Guess what?",
  "32155": "For sheer terror?",
  "32156": "Did you know this?",
  "32157": "What did I tell you about making me creak the door?",
  "32158": "And in what consists this plot?",
  "32159": "Whether those pleading orators were persons educated in the general knowledge of equity, or only in provincial, national, and other local customs?",
  "32160": "Shall I fetch you another cup?",
  "32161": "How's that for high living?",
  "32162": "Then for what reason did he call me son?",
  "32163": "And why do you keep following me about?",
  "32164": "Is it worth while to keep an army to protect you in writing proclamations, or to get once a year into winter quarters?",
  "32165": "Well, what's to be done?",
  "32166": "You mean you'll join us?",
  "32167": "Have you given this man work before?",
  "32168": "In the way, you mean, of living with US?",
  "32169": "Is he from home?",
  "32170": "Is there a house in the neighborhood?",
  "32171": "What were you doing on that armchair?",
  "32172": "What say my other friends?",
  "32173": "Some one?",
  "32174": "Do you then suspect any one?",
  "32175": "But why should you have been anxious?",
  "32176": "What size do you want to be?",
  "32177": "Now, is there any sense in these things?",
  "32178": "What manner of man is he?",
  "32179": "I might let that to you, for what matters it to me?",
  "32180": "What was the opinion?",
  "32181": "Nothing to you?",
  "32182": "I suppose you have had dinner?",
  "32183": "Where in the word did you acquire such a voluminous vocabulary?",
  "32184": "And what if other benefits were gained by peace?",
  "32185": "What is it, father?",
  "32186": "What did you tell him?",
  "32187": "From the cardinal?",
  "32188": "Is it far from here, sir?",
  "32189": "When was he married?",

  "32194": "Do you know anything?",
  "32195": "If this sad picture you have drawn, be indeed true to nature, how does your country, said I, appear so attractive, as to draw to it so large a portion of our population?",
  "32196": "That's interesting, eh?",
  "32197": "Whither so soon?",
  "32198": "Did you find no trace of him?",
  "32199": "The sovereigns?",
  "32200": "A physician?",
  "32201": "Where ought I be, then?",
  "32202": "Who said that she was to belong to you?",
  "32203": "In this place?",
  "32204": "You mean it is a little dry, perhaps?",
  "32205": "You are not touched even by that danger?",
  "32206": "Then this racket they are making is on account of it, I suppose?",
  "32207": "For what is he in prison then?",
  "32208": "Would exasperation, however, if relief had longer been postponed, finally have betrayed me?",
  "32209": "What did I mean by asking questions?",
  "32210": "Will you dance with me?",
  "32211": "Can you dive?",
  "32212": "More rabbits?",
  "32213": "For this?",
  "32214": "Was there any connection between the commotion of the atmosphere and that of the interior of the earth?",
  "32215": "A merry going forth bringeth often a sorrowful return, and a merry evening maketh a sad morning?",
  "32216": "And even of what he knew, how much could he make his untravelled friend either apprehend or believe?",
  "32217": "When did you enter the room?",
  "32218": "Whom have I to live for?",
  "32219": "Going to lose her?",
  "32220": "And may we be so bold as to affirm that there are also many criminals to be found in them, rogues who have stings, and whom the authorities are careful to restrain by force?",
  "32221": "For such matters?",
  "32222": "And do you object to going through the village?",
  "32223": "What do you think of that figure there?",
  "32224": "To how many people can any one tell all?",
  "32225": "Could a body hypocritically take there a small hypocritical touch?",
  "32226": "How have they made me a victim?",
  "32227": "But where can he be?",
  "32228": "How am I?",

  "32230": "What could he have done to me?",
  "32231": "Do you take us for thieves?",
  "32232": "For a young cobra?",
  "32233": "Theramenes?",
  "32234": "France?",
  "32235": "Tell me, my dear sir, do you admit the existence of volcanoes on the moon's surface?",
  "32236": "Was it not necessary for the good of the state and the interests of the young king, that you should live in good intelligence with the queen?",
  "32237": "What could be the meaning of his sudden change toward me?",
  "32238": "He warned you to abandon your visit?",
  "32239": "Did you really come to propose to me?",
  "32240": "And then, you ungrateful being, you are not pleased to see an old friend?",
  "32241": "Will you return to this gang of robbers, and to this man, when a word can save you?",
  "32242": "Because of the money?",
  "32243": "Who could place my feet on the right path, and bring me back to my company?",
  "32244": "Why did you pull the curtain over the place to make me think you were still there?",
  "32245": "And are the hours the same?",
  "32246": "What is the reason?",
  "32247": "Money is no object?",
  "32248": "Where, then, could the driver be, unless he were inside the house?",
  "32249": "Nay, has not a little rationality exposed many women to the severest censure?",
  "32250": "Was that all right?",
  "32251": "What is it?",
  "32252": "Why is the ardour of youth thus to be damped, and the luxuriancy of fancy cut to the quick?",
  "32253": "If there be no distinction between the pleasing and the disgusting, why does it accept the one or reject the other?",
  "32254": "How is that?",
  "32255": "What consolation does the poor suffering soul find in the superb coffin, in the splendid funeral?",
  "32256": "And what am I myself?",

  "32282": "What whole thing?",
  "32283": "Since it was your intention to live alone, why did you throw into the sea the document which put us on your track?",
  "32284": "If this were human life, if these were human beings, living in a complete world, then what was her own world, outside?",
  "32285": "We are at peace and, why then, should they harm us?",
  "32286": "Then you believe the papers?",
  "32287": "What must I do, officer?",
  "32288": "What do you like to talk about?",
  "32289": "Getting a bit hot, eh?",
  "32290": "If she had wished it, would she not have sent to me by this time?",
  "32291": "Or whom oppose?",
  "32292": "Was it, when he set his heart upon it?",
  "32293": "You, who refuse to tell me the slightest thing?",
  "32294": "Where's mama?",
  "32295": "Are we in any great danger?",
  "32296": "Or will a reaction set in which may arrest progress and even undo much that has been done?",
  "32297": "You are only responsible for my body, is it not so?",
  "32298": "But for this imaginary resistance, officially announced, how would it have been possible to justify the spoliations and exactions which ensued?",
  "32299": "How can you deliberately get up such paltry falsehoods?",
  "32300": "Afterwards to me?",
  "32301": "Carries a bag?",
  "32302": "Shall you not all help me?",
  "32303": "What signified the terms to them, so long as we obtained the actual surrender of people who only wanted a good opportunity to give up gracefully?",
  "32304": "Shall I cut it out?",
  "32305": "Would not the doing of this be your best mode of counteracting his raid on your communications?",
  "32306": "After dinner, eh?",
  "32307": "Well, what, my dear girl?",
  "32308": "What would they say if I did not go?",
  "32309": "But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?",
  "32310": "But to what in the world?",
  "32311": "By your leave, do you know me, sir?",
  "32312": "He will be ruined, you mean?",
  "32313": "What of the prisoner?",
  "32314": "Do you not see that by its solidification, it would burst through this field of ice that imprisons us, as, when it freezes, it bursts the hardest stones?",
  "32315": "Then it appears there will be an opposition, and the enterprise will be disputed?",
  "32316": "Have you heard?",
  "32317": "Will you dine with me?",
  "32318": "Does he ever come back to this neighborhood?",
  "32319": "And, if ignorance of everything which it is needful a ruler should know is likely to do so much harm in the governing classes of the future, why is it, they ask reasonably enough, that such ignorance in the governing classes of the past has not been viewed with equal horror?",
  "32320": "And now, tell me your name?",
  "32321": "Do you fear their finding it here, should they come to search?",
  "32322": "Whither are they going?",
  "32323": "What is it, now?",
  "32324": "Was it a thicket?",
  "32325": "Was this the beginning of a happy change?",
  "32326": "Sir, may I have a few words with you concerning some business I have just decided upon?",
  "32327": "But where are you really going?",
  "32328": "What am dat?",
  "32329": "I hope there is no reason to distrust his fidelity?",
  "32330": "Of twelve rowers?",
  "32331": "How can one talk or think of such trifles?",
  "32332": "But what are we to do now?",
  "32333": "How does it happen that the presence of a woman overwhelms us so?",
  "32334": "Which do you know?",
  "32335": "You ask me what I will do?",
  "32336": "Then, surely, you will not object to lend it to us?",
  "32337": "What of him?",
  "32338": "And do you know what has become of him?",
  "32339": "Can you tell me, please, who is his favourite actor?",
  "32340": "What more could I hope to do by prolonging the interview?",
  "32341": "Pierced?",
  "32342": "What do you expect to get?",
  "32343": "Besides, was he not in the secret?",
  "32344": "Was it of any use to explain?",
  "32345": "How's the rheumatics?",
  "32346": "But where can one go?",
  "32347": "Where am I?",
  "32348": "Was it after all true that she had been conducting herself in a way that justified the world in thinking that she liked the man?",
  "32349": "And, pray, who are you yourself?",
  "32350": "Is it possible for such a reason?",
  "32351": "Oh, how could we, on your money?",
  "32352": "Why should I give you courage?",
  "32353": "And how much have you got?",
  "32354": "How are you, young man?",
  "32355": "Chillip?",
  "32356": "I say, why are you so late?",
  "32357": "Will the job suit you?",
  "32358": "And who charges me with this, monseigneur?",
  "32359": "Shall I go on?",
  "32360": "To what do they seem to you to be like?",
  "32361": "And how stands the total?",
  "32362": "And did they not leave him on the south side of the river, with their prisoners, while they have gone foolishly on the north?",
  "32363": "Or spiders?",
  "32364": "But you receive him at your house?",
  "32365": "Was there a human agency in the matter?",
  "32366": "And what is the coachman like?",
  "32367": "Have we beheld demons?",
  "32368": "What is his religious doctrine to me, if he carries some good notions along with it?",
  "32369": "And when will that be, father?",
  "32370": "Who could have told her?",
  "32371": "That's it?",
  "32372": "How can I describe my sensations on beholding it?",
  "32373": "What can it be that has this double power?",
  "32374": "And yet you have sent for me?",
  "32375": "Why does a chicken cross the road?",
  "32376": "Who's got the job?",
  "32377": "Is she pretty?",
  "32378": "If ever you can get aboard again, says you?",
  "32379": "Shall I fire my rifle off and scare him?",
  "32380": "Have you ever told a lie?",
  "32381": "You have seen it on dozens of girls, and you never found out that it was pretty till now?",
  "32382": "What, the whole property there?",
  "32383": "Is it so important to you?",
  "32384": "What fiend possesses you to stare back at me, continually, with those infernal eyes?",
  "32385": "Even in the country do we get any rest?",
  "32386": "What is it, my friend?",
  "32387": "Why calls my friend?",
  "32388": "Were you examined at an inquest?",
  "32389": "How do they love it dressed?",
  "32390": "How can they get loose when there's a guard over them, ready to shoot them down if they move a peg?",
  "32391": "Your husband, then, is at last dead?",
  "32392": "Pillage?",
  "32393": "Is everyone all right?",
  "32394": "What do you say of this?",
  "32395": "Which do YOU think it was?",
  "32396": "Why is that gendarme there?",
  "32397": "Is it because I am not clean, and my clothes are all in rags, and because I am obliged to go begging about after the manner of tramps and beggars generally?",
  "32398": "But what are these beasts?",
  "32399": "You think your sister will come?",
  "32400": "You see him?",
  "32401": "Against the westland clans?",
  "32402": "And when will you come to see mamma?",
  "32403": "He did not happen to see our plan of fortifications, did he?",
  "32404": "You are not going out, I hope?",
  "32405": "If a man with a broad basis of popular support like that was proposing to entertain a duke, surely there could be no doubt about his motives?",
  "32406": "Does your majesty grant me this?",
  "32407": "Where was the horse?",
  "32408": "When is it going to be?",
  "32409": "Do you still feel any desire to stand up in his defence?",
  "32410": "Do you know who made you?",
  "32411": "What sort of a watchman, of a checker, are you?",
  "32412": "I hoped it was true?",
  "32413": "After?",
  "32414": "Why will you not grant my last wish?",
  "32415": "Do you pay taxes to an agent that he may destroy your property?",
  "32416": "He would have to fly, and where?",
  "32417": "In a figurative sense, how far, and to what offences, may it be extended?",
  "32418": "And what do you think of him?",
  "32419": "The register of my child's birth?",
  "32420": "Was there one exception, and that one he who needed to have been most happy?",
  "32421": "Who is this maid?",
  "32422": "But what was she to do?",
  "32423": "The peasants are ruined?",
  "32424": "Who but a billionaire could say what was fair exchange for a billion?",
  "32425": "Two pounds, and you bring it back?",
  "32426": "What natural force could have produced such plants, and what must have been the appearance of the earth in the first ages of its formation, when, under the action of heat and moisture, the vegetable kingdom alone was developing on its surface?",
  "32427": "You love me just a little, then, marquise?",
  "32428": "Why are you virtuous?",
  "32429": "Are you far gone with a fool?",
  "32430": "How can a man conceal his character?",
  "32431": "What should I do?",
  "32432": "Is that all?",
  "32433": "Who, sire?",
  "32434": "I think I am a philosopher, perhaps, and who knows, perhaps I do wish to teach my views of things to those I meet with?",
  "32435": "Do I seem one to fear for myself?",
  "32436": "But suppose you've bitten a specky bit by accident?",
  "32437": "But where do they sleep?",
  "32438": "You have seen him, then?",
  "32439": "But, just what did the genewal tell you?",
  "32440": "There's nothing to keep you, is there?",
  "32441": "Nicholas, when when did you break your cameo?",
  "32442": "D'you remember the last time we met?",
  "32443": "What hope could there have been for him then?",
  "32444": "You have no mother?",
  "32445": "Outside of a private car?",
  "32446": "And what was this spring of the floor under his feet to the dizzy eccentric lurch with which in the old time the trembling ship yielded to the beat of staggering billows, drunk with their power?",
  "32447": "How is she ever to do better?",
  "32448": "You had heard that there was an execution in the house?",
  "32449": "Can you see where he has put his rifle or his bow?",
  "32450": "But who the deuce is he following?",
  "32451": "Are not necessary pleasures those of which we cannot get rid, and of which the satisfaction is a benefit to us?",
  "32452": "Can they understand or explain even their own characters?",
  "32453": "And why so?",
  "32454": "Is he a good doctor, my love?",
  "32455": "And where is your lodging?",
  "32456": "I hope, my dear friend, you will carry out your father's wish?",
  "32457": "You have knocked at all doors?",
  "32458": "Old man, how goes?",
  "32459": "But what could he have to do with this old family custom of ours, and what does this rigmarole mean?",
  "32460": "Will you take my arm, sir?",
  "32461": "Is it in my character?",
  "32462": "Uncle, what wood is this?",
  "32463": "Well, what did he say then?",
  "32464": "There they were, the words, and what did she want more?",
  "32465": "What does he desire of me?",
  "32466": "Are you like all the rest?",
  "32467": "How dare you grin at me like that?",
  "32468": "Who will make me that summons?",
  "32469": "Especially with copper toes?",
  "32470": "Was it the effect of the lunar rays?",
  "32471": "What have you said?",
  "32472": "You never find he slights his work when your back is turned?",
  "32473": "Perhaps you would like to pay interest?",
  "32474": "Which is she?",
  "32475": "Is that any reason why we should propose to preserve it for ever in a condition of tutelage?",
  "32476": "And my walking up and down for three hours from the table to the stove?",
  "32477": "Not chops?",
  "32478": "Would he choose the peers, for example?",
  "32479": "Why, how are you?",
  "32480": "Who persuaded them into letting him see if he could drive?",
  "32481": "Do you think you can behead me with a single blow?",
  "32482": "Where is the letter?",
  "32483": "Poor old who?",
  "32484": "Me?",
  "32485": "Do you know this person?",
  "32486": "What WILL he do, then?",

  "32488": "Your birthday?",
  "32489": "What have your family got to do with it?",
  "32490": "How much do I get?",
  "32491": "But may he not change and transform himself?",
  "32492": "It is not so?",
  "32493": "Then I shall really have them?",
  "32494": "So you go back from your promise?",
  "32495": "May she?",
  "32496": "Do you remember what I said when you asked me what I should do if I won all the pots I set my heart on and came through alive?",
  "32497": "Is it too great?",
  "32498": "At it again, hey?",
  "32499": "Which was it?",
  "32500": "Do you believe in presentiments and superstitions?",
  "32501": "Are you now satisfied?",
  "32502": "Your success too?",
  "32503": "The bandits whom the abbe keeps in pay and drink have their useful side, have they?",
  "32504": "Can a man who listens to these three counsellors be sure that he is right in a given decision?",
  "32505": "Have we not perfectly understood each other?",
  "32506": "There is a good postal service, I suppose?",
  "32507": "Comes it in there?",
  "32508": "Tell us now, at once, what you made of the present?",
  "32509": "What is popular sovereignty?",
  "32510": "Do you think we are sure to come out of the wilderness?",
  "32511": "How hang your pouches?",
  "32512": "Should you like to be her boatman?",
  "32513": "How did I survive and surmount such wounds?",
  "32514": "How often we sin, how much we deceive, and all for what?",
  "32515": "Will soon what?",
  "32516": "And we recognize also that this absolute equality has only been known, and can only be known, through the medium of sight or touch, or of some other of the senses, which are all alike in this respect?",
  "32517": "Know you anything of your own family at that time?",
  "32518": "And from a noble client?",
  "32519": "So that, in fact, you have never learned or heard anything in particular?",
  "32520": "What was said or done?",
  "32521": "And where will your worship drink?",
  "32522": "How is it that you have no friends in your prosperity when you had many in adversity?",
  "32523": "King's attorney?",
  "32524": "What could they think indeed?",
  "32525": "HERE?",
  "32526": "If he were in love with the lady?",
  "32527": "Why does she come so close?",
  "32528": "And will he be the better for that?",
  "32529": "What's the matter with your nose, there?",
  "32530": "Now I ax what have they to show for their three months' setting?",
  "32531": "Cherries?",
  "32532": "How are we to know them if we do find them?",
  "32533": "What about the other girl, the one you decoyed away over a week ago?",
  "32534": "How could she not be happy?",
  "32535": "It has been a delightful evening, has it not?",
  "32536": "And now, doctor, what are we to do about money?",
  "32537": "Had they not searched exactly where the document stated?",
  "32538": "How you like it, hey, ole sport?",
  "32539": "But what human language can adequately portray that astonishment, that horror which possessed me at the spectacle then presented to view?",
  "32540": "At best, might not a man in the water lose all his power of direction, and so move in an endless circle until he sank exhausted?",
  "32541": "Does his wife know of it?",
  "32542": "And what is the solar heat?",
  "32543": "If any one were to come in, my dear boy?",
  "32544": "Has your grace taken the precaution to come out in a good stout pair of boots?",
  "32545": "Whet, whoiver knew yah wur coming?",

  "32549": "How could he take the infant from the mother's breast, or abandon the daughter to the fatal influences from which only, by so violent an effort, he could free the son?",
  "32550": "Was that all a human being amounted to?",
  "32551": "But you would not advise me to refuse?",
  "32552": "And so much to my honour too?",
  "32553": "And why look there?",

  "32562": "The one in the dark blue coat?",
  "32563": "Want any?",
  "32564": "But why?",
  "32565": "And could it be believed that it at last seems to us as if the problem had never been propounded before, as if we were the first to discern it, get a sight of it, and RISK RAISING it?",
  "32566": "If you come to that, it's hardly my place to be flung out of the flat like this and have to go to an hotel, what?",
  "32567": "Will you open, yes or no?",
  "32568": "If so, on what does your constitution rest?",

  "32584": "Do the footmen kiss her?",
  "32585": "But why does she lie on a sofa?",
  "32586": "What answer was sent?",
  "32587": "What, billing, exchanging stolen glances and broken murmurs?",

  "32603": "Why did you come, then?",
  "32604": "What was the abbe's name?",
  "32605": "Never see you again?",
  "32606": "Would the lock click at the end of those seemingly interminable intervals of time?",
  "32607": "Comes he not?",
  "32608": "Why am I left here alone?",
  "32609": "Do you mean to say you think we are going to have bad weather?",
  "32610": "But who attributes to the animals a belief that the phenomena of nature are worked by a multitude of invisible animals or by one enormous and prodigiously strong animal behind the scenes?",

  "32656": "Do you think as it could be a rabbit?",
  "32657": "But how did you get to work again?",
  "32658": "Would it not, moreover, be much more easy for him to gain his daughter, if he did all in his power to forward his father's views?",

  "33047": "Then the truth is too bad to tell?",
  "33048": "Can this be, then?",
  "33049": "Which is your house?",
  "33050": "Where else can he be?",
  "33051": "What should I be but for you?",
  "33052": "Ah, then, you do not love me?",
  "33053": "Many of them?",
  "33054": "Oh, you do, do you?",
  "33055": "And this is a letter, is it?",
  "33056": "How do you get your dinner, then?",
  "33057": "Where shall I find you?",
  "33058": "Will you fight me?",
  "33059": "What do you suppose he meant?",
  "33060": "Do you love me still?",
  "33061": "Which is the way out, please?",
  "33062": "Now, what's your name?",
  "33063": "How can it, by coming quickly into the eyes and ears, distinguish the pleasing from the disgusting in external objects?",
  "33064": "You love it, do you?",
  "33065": "And, yet, how could it be otherwise?",
  "33066": "Why had this agent preserved silence?",
  "33067": "They include, I presume, correspondence?",
  "33068": "How can you not know?",
  "33069": "But how came he to be there?",
  "33070": "Do you wish to destroy me?",
  "33071": "And he who is most skilful in preventing or escaping from a disease is best able to create one?",
  "33072": "What remained to her of primitive virtue?",
  "33073": "This, sir?",
  "33074": "Jo, dear, what is it?",
  "33075": "How would you like to have some tableaux in here?",
  "33076": "With this boy?",
  "33077": "Do you know who I am?",
  "33078": "When I spoke in confidence to your brother, could I regard him as an inquisitor?",
  "33079": "Did you court her for her wealth?",
  "33080": "You are acquainted?",
  "33081": "But what would be the use of new continents?",
  "33082": "Have I kept my promise, yes or no?",
  "33083": "There used to be a certain amount of solidity in all things, but now what happens?",
  "33084": "Because I love the court?",
  "33085": "Can one ever tell anyone what one is feeling?",
  "33086": "Who knows how easy it is for ambition to call itself vocation?",
  "33087": "Was it my mother's or my father's act?",
  "33088": "Is this a carelessness, or what?",
  "33089": "Weak?",
  "33090": "Might they not hang him at once, and inquire into his case afterward?",
  "33091": "What do they say?",
  "33092": "Had she really any life of her own behind all her propagandism?",
  "33093": "Do you think this would be the first time a woman had repented of an infidelity?",
  "33094": "Do you think our little girl here need be afraid?",
  "33095": "Can you tell me why you foster the cruel deception?",
  "33096": "What else has the world given me for all that I have done for it?",
  "33097": "And what good will it do you?",
  "33098": "Why joke?",
  "33099": "What is he like, uncle?",
  "33100": "And is not the truest pity, when a man has a sore point, not to touch it at all?",

  "33102": "Who would hear her?",
  "33103": "Do you not see that they are all giving me the wink, and wanting me to turn you out by force, only I do not like to do so?",
  "33104": "And are you glad to see me?",
  "33105": "And what is the pay?",
  "33106": "Has he now some disciples?",
  "33107": "To sleep?",
  "33108": "What'll it be?",
  "33109": "But a little rakish, hey?",
  "33110": "With friends like that, who needs enemies?",
  "33111": "A bride?",
  "33112": "Or what is become of them?",
  "33113": "Is he indeed, sir?",
  "33114": "He will not talk to me about it, so why should I trouble him?",
  "33115": "But is not your eminence going to the queen?",
  "33116": "At once?",
  "33117": "Will it be long first?",
  "33118": "But am I sure?",
  "33119": "Rita?",
  "33120": "Who took that step?",
  "33121": "What's better in him?",
  "33122": "But why should I make a long story?",
  "33123": "If error is possible there, why not here?",
  "33124": "Nothing else?",
  "33125": "You say 'What are they regarding?",
  "33126": "Have you not left off your impudent pretensions there yet?",
  "33127": "That is all true, then, is it?",
  "33128": "Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary clothes on?",
  "33129": "May we see it now?",
  "33130": "What's to be done?",
  "33131": "Was he the only applicant?",
  "33132": "A man who has paid every penalty for wrong, if wrong there was?",
  "33133": "You surely will not do that, my dear count?",
  "33134": "What did this mean?",
  "33135": "What mysterious thing can this be?",
  "33136": "Well, sir, what is it?",
  "33137": "In what place, captain?",
  "33138": "Then where are the other people?",
  "33139": "Very bad, eh?",
  "33140": "What do you think of this?",
  "33141": "Where is your justification for inflicting all this pain?",
  "33142": "Why should we consider ourselves, men and women, as broken fragments of one whole?",
  "33143": "Is a man who has a sudden attack of pain in tooth or stomach not to be permitted to go to the nearest druggist's shop and ask for something that will relieve him?",
  "33144": "Then, is she dying?",
  "33145": "Are you all right now?",
  "33146": "Where've you hid your letters?",
  "33147": "What is the matter with her?",
  "33148": "And what favor, pray?",
  "33149": "What do you want to have me here for?",
  "33150": "What mad pursuit?",
  "33151": "Why not?",
  "33152": "But what would you have me do, child?",
  "33153": "Had she tried her strength again, what had that availed?",
  "33154": "Do you hear what I say?",
  "33155": "Of what complexion?",
  "33156": "Is she to be shown up to your room?",
  "33157": "And, if I said so, to whom would the place belong?",
  "33158": "If they are not, with what propriety can the like power justify such a charge against the national government, or even be urged as an obstacle to its adoption?",
  "33159": "Is no one about who can get in?",
  "33160": "Will you have brilliants, or a castle by the sea, or, perhaps, a yacht?",
  "33161": "Do they follow us so far?",
  "33162": "But even if one might, what feeling except veneration could such a man as my father evoke?",
  "33163": "Who will give it to me?",
  "33164": "Who is so bold as to do it?",
  "33165": "Why did you come here to find me, then?",
  "33166": "English?",
  "33167": "Can I be always by your side?",
  "33168": "Auntie, what have I done?",
  "33169": "Where's your shells?",
  "33170": "Is it your business, eh?",
  "33171": "Do you see that island?",
  "33172": "You think that she would refuse me?",
  "33173": "Did you sleep badly?",
  "33174": "Is it because we are invited?",
  "33175": "Will you walk a little bit with me?",
  "33176": "Do you deny that you were listening at that door?",
  "33177": "How soon may we hope to get back?",
  "33178": "Is the wind north or south?",
  "33179": "Yet how could he think her capable of deliberately wishing to renew their assignations now?",
  "33180": "Aluminum?",
  "33181": "How could it have been me?",
  "33182": "What makes you say that?",
  "33183": "And who will be the warden of the hospital?",
  "33184": "What's that that has fallen?",
  "33185": "Has judgment been pronounced?",
  "33186": "And who is the criminal?",
  "33187": "Can you row?",
  "33188": "Can he spare you?",
  "33189": "Shall we ever know?",
  "33190": "But who the devil has fortified this paltry little place in this manner?",
  "33191": "Do you remember any case at all like it?",
  "33192": "What am I to do now?",
  "33193": "About me?",
  "33194": "It is then the interest of the enemies of this potentate to secure and publish this letter, so as to make a breach between his country and ours?",
  "33195": "Brooke?",
  "33196": "Is it funny?",
  "33197": "But if so, where was the girl, and what had she done with the papers?",
  "33198": "And you did not know any one else on the train?",
  "33199": "You intend to remain?",
  "33200": "No guarantee?",
  "33201": "Are you asking for a lodger?",
  "33202": "And if it knew, would it dare?",
  "33203": "And what do you call that little metal ruler?",
  "33204": "What is advantage?",
  "33205": "You are not going, papa?",
  "33206": "Is that what you have been trying?",
  "33207": "My little woman, why do you look at me in that way?",
  "33208": "What do you want to say?",
  "33209": "Is yours a long part?",
  "33210": "Gentle?",
  "33211": "What is POLITICS?",
  "33212": "What did their tears imply?",
  "33213": "What shall the court do?",
  "33214": "But what do YOU think?",
  "33215": "If he had not lost his balance, why should he have launched into an almost passionate defence of the physical coward?",
  "33216": "And is it not very rational to conclude, that the women who have not been taught to respect the human nature of their own sex, in these particulars, will not long respect the mere difference of sex, in their husbands?",
  "33217": "What is the object of these questions?",
  "33218": "Oh you're there, are you?",
  "33219": "How much may it amount to?",
  "33220": "Shall I tell him all, then, openly?",
  "33221": "Oswald, have you not your mother to come to the rescue?",
  "33222": "O, do you know me, man?",
  "33223": "And how do you get on with the officers?",
  "33224": "How dare you come when you're not wanted?",
  "33225": "Is it certainly accursed?",
  "33226": "But to do this he must have spoken?",
  "33227": "Have you ever died yet?",
  "33228": "Who would ever suspect me, me, me, especially if I should choose a being I had no interest in doing away with?",
  "33229": "Trust to the sword the fortunes of the world?",
  "33230": "Where is your crown, then?",
  "33231": "And even if there's a delay, how can it alter the end?",
  "33232": "It will not be opened when the hearing is resumed?",
  "33233": "Then what does he do?",
  "33234": "Have the rebels been successful up to this time?",

  "33446": "Are you there?",
  "33447": "Why should he?",
  "33448": "Why make all these excuses?",
  "33449": "How do you like us?",

  "33451": "Is he quite gone away?",
  "33452": "Well, what do you say, are we going shooting tomorrow?",
  "33453": "Consoled?",
  "33454": "Do you suppose I want to be told where to go?",
  "33455": "Just you and the river, and no one else to pass a word with?",
  "33456": "But did there not exist in the island some animal which might supply the place of the horse, ass, or ox?",
  "33457": "Shall I?",
  "33458": "Did she speak of the man?",
  "33459": "What was to be done?",
  "33460": "You do not care if he does?",

  "33462": "And what a devil is become of them?",
  "33463": "I wonder whether you remember what I said to you then?",
  "33464": "Did you never hear that from the young girls where you come from in the west or south?",
  "33465": "The night porter saw nothing, I suppose?",
  "33466": "For who can guess?",
  "33467": "And so you think that I ought to answer your indictment as if I were in a court?",
  "33468": "What need they?",
  "33469": "Who?",
  "33470": "Regular people who get you a place?",
  "33471": "Is this a practical joke?",
  "33472": "Why should they ever be afraid to dash up and harry us, when they know full well that they run no greater risk at our hands than if we were stumps in their orchards?",

  "33517": "And YOUR cheese, your excellency?",
  "33518": "And yet you saw how she thanked me, with her so beautiful dying eyes, her voice, too, so weak, and she kiss my rough old hand and bless me?",
  "33519": "In what respects?",
  "33520": "Had I caught her off her guard?",
  "33521": "And why does the weight know how to find it by so short a line?",
  "33522": "Can you have any difference with your father?",
  "33523": "Going away, sir?",
  "33524": "What's it about?",
  "33525": "Then it is he whom you suspect?",
  "33526": "What is your rank?",
  "33527": "And ruined her character?",

  "33544": "Were you not, gentlemen, both in the musketeers of the late king?",
  "33545": "How long his he been there?",
  "33546": "What is this oven for?",
  "33547": "Nay, will not such a one often rejoice more than any other in the rich show of outer apparel?",
  "33548": "What does that nonsense mean?",
  "33549": "Would the selfish and the cowardly ever lack reasons for yielding to the enemy?",

  "33563": "What are you saying to her?",
  "33564": "You're dancing, are you?",
  "33565": "Hate you, sir?",
  "33566": "Would you know him again?",
  "33567": "If I consent to announce you, may I at least know whom to announce, monsieur?",
  "33568": "What's wrong with my face?",
  "33569": "Had that begun in your time?",
  "33570": "Never been there?",
  "33571": "Is he not in love?",
  "33572": "What did she answer?",
  "33573": "Do you dare to say that I am not right?",
  "33574": "What are the facts?",
  "33575": "Somebody has called?",
  "33576": "What use will peace be when he is no longer here?",
  "33577": "Unable to grasp any thing great, is it surprising that they find the reading of history a very dry task, and disquisitions addressed to the understanding, intolerably tedious, and almost unintelligible?",
  "33578": "The inhabitants of the island and the sailors?",
  "33579": "You've got a mark upon you somewheres or another, I suppose?",
  "33580": "Where are all the listeners and spies who accompany the queen?",
  "33581": "What is this gnawing of conscience I am feeling now?",
  "33582": "What, are they gone, sirs?",
  "33583": "Whom the deuce can it be from?",
  "33584": "Need there now be any secrets between us?",
  "33585": "Was not he sent for?",
  "33586": "When was it received?",
  "33587": "But why on earth should you be pursued with such animosity?",
  "33588": "Further, there can be no doubt that a work is spoilt when not done at the right time?",
  "33589": "What is it in your hand?",
  "33590": "What arrangement, squire?",
  "33591": "Do you remember that I paid it you ten days later, and you put it at the bottom of the tobacco?",
  "33592": "Did he mention the precise order of occupation to which he would addict himself?",
  "33593": "But be seated, and tell us now what is the cause of your docility?",
  "33594": "What the devil right have you to interfere?",
  "33595": "Has he decided to do so?",
  "33596": "And with how many fingers does he bless?",
  "33597": "Do you think I cannot see?",
  "33598": "If I preserve my purity in the society of the trees, why should he who would have me preserve it among men, seek to rob me of it?",
  "33599": "What had happened to bring this shocking change about?",
  "33600": "DID you see all the diamonds those ladies wore?",
  "33601": "How is that?",
  "33602": "With that?",
  "33603": "Did you recognize?",
  "33604": "What have we done, what has this poor thing done, that we are so sore beset?",
  "33605": "Must hate and death return?",
  "33606": "Why not view it often by faith?",
  "33607": "They are not fit for me, are they?",
  "33608": "Any lazy idle loafers that want flogging in this class?",
  "33609": "Why, then, do I not hear them?",
  "33610": "Do you accept my solution of the mystery?",
  "33611": "Not one year, madame?",
  "33612": "Was it right or wrong?",
  "33613": "Have you understood how our dog was so strangely thrown up out of the water of the lake, after his struggle with the dugong?",
  "33614": "How have you defended me?",
  "33615": "What are their sufferings?",
  "33616": "How about the widows and orphans confided to you?",
  "33617": "What have you got to do with the dew, ma'am?",
  "33618": "Is life to be purchased by such a sacrifice?",
  "33619": "What tell you me of fasting days?",
  "33620": "And have the children looked after themselves at all, sir?",
  "33621": "A dress for you, also, is it not, my friend?",
  "33622": "Coavinses?",
  "33623": "Had we a river, a lake, a sea to depend upon?",
  "33624": "But nobody possesses it, so what would you have?",
  "33625": "You have made it up?",
  "33626": "When is it to be done?",
  "33627": "How, then, could they provide for themselves, and when had they time to plough and sow their fields?",
  "33628": "Was her husband, to whom it legally belonged, to make it over to her as a free gift?",
  "33629": "Is what you hear at church, religion?",
  "33630": "And what enlargement do you expect to obtain in this way?",
  "33631": "Plans?",
  "33632": "What might be the consequences?",
  "33633": "Would she have pitied him had she seen him?",
  "33634": "Aronnax?",
  "33635": "In your own heart, do you feel quite certain?",
  "33636": "Or you, my lords, to be my followers?",
  "33637": "It is true?",
  "33638": "Then in time of peace justice will be of no use?",
  "33639": "But how could you guess what the motive was?",
  "33640": "What did you think of that?",
  "33641": "When will you come?",
  "33642": "Is it possible, then, to love, if you are not loved?",
  "33643": "Will you be her servants?",
  "33644": "Would she never issue from it?",
  "33645": "There's nothing wrong?",
  "33646": "NOT a party in anything, ma'am?",
  "33647": "Have I cut my heart into a demd extraordinary number of little pieces, and given them all away, one after another, to the same little engrossing demnition captivater, and can I live to be suspected by her?",
  "33648": "Then what?",
  "33649": "Supper?",
  "33650": "Can anyone do much for anyone else unless by making a will in his favour and dying then and there?",
  "33651": "Did we not leave her, but just now?",
  "33652": "Then?",
  "33653": "Has anything worried you?",
  "33654": "And who shall then stick closest to ye, and excite others?",
  "33655": "Can I rely upon you?",
  "33656": "Oh, you are the young feller who did that poster?",
  "33657": "Do you know of any houses?",
  "33658": "Do you mean to say that this slip of paper will help us?",
  "33659": "What identity?",
  "33660": "Did you bring the things I mentioned?",
  "33661": "But, my lord, if there be no secret of penitence, will the director consent to my being here?",
  "33662": "Do you have a faith, or a knowledge, you follow, which helps you to live and to do right?",
  "33663": "Is not this what we would have all men do to us?",
  "33664": "You hussy, how dare you talk in that way?",
  "33665": "Now, what shall we do?",
  "33666": "Which should it be?",
  "33667": "Will you follow me?",
  "33668": "What else can I do?",
  "33669": "How would you like to come into a house and find everyone muttering to themselves?",
  "33670": "And can the just by justice make men unjust, or speaking general can the good by virtue make them bad?",
  "33671": "You're sure?",
  "33672": "Are we to see profound wisdom in this?",
  "33673": "Is it not, said she, whispering her husband in his ear, is it not a noble nose?",
  "33674": "Who'll keep THEM quiet?",
  "33675": "Had any difference arisen between him and her papa?",
  "33676": "And what shall I?",
  "33677": "Not so much so?",
  "33678": "You are fond of it?",
  "33679": "May I see it?",
  "33680": "Tell me, do you know what the countess, for whose pardon you are beseeching me, has done?",
  "33681": "Had she not openly avowed her intention of marrying for money if she ever had the chance?",
  "33682": "That the boy may sink and perish?",
  "33683": "Whose there?",
  "33684": "Been there long?",
  "33685": "Which is the way?",
  "33686": "Or his starch'd beard?",
  "33687": "Who knows what may be in store for you yet?",
  "33688": "By this?",
  "33689": "And not long?",
  "33690": "Is that certain?",
  "33691": "Are you asleep?",
  "33692": "Any ideas?",
  "33693": "Have we been deceived by an illusion?",
  "33694": "Was it physical?",
  "33695": "Caution?",
  "33696": "Did not you know that, my dear lord?",
  "33697": "Did not your friend here look like me?",
  "33698": "What are you rattling in there?",
  "33699": "But again, will they tell us that such a nature, placed under favourable circumstances, will not be perfectly good and wise if any ever was?",
  "33700": "Has not one of you a cross?",
  "33701": "And what does the judge affirm to be the life which is next, and the pleasure which is next?",
  "33702": "Was my uncle stark mad?",
  "33703": "Or have we found angels in the forms of kings to govern him?",
  "33704": "More in your brains than in your pocket, eh?",
  "33705": "He has come, then, as they told me?",
  "33706": "The only unofficial detective?",
  "33707": "Have you had lunch yet?",
  "33708": "Far from here?",
  "33709": "Whither is it carrying me?",
  "33710": "And where are they looking for her?",
  "33711": "Who told you this?",
  "33712": "Of what was he thinking?",
  "33713": "Do you think it is too much?",
  "33714": "D'you remember you were rather sniffy about meeting him?",
  "33715": "Is that what you wished to say?",
  "33716": "How much of the ballast of conservatism and of loyalty to tradition is it well to throw overboard in the interest of accelerated motion?",
  "33717": "Shall a similar end be pursued for the ethical purpose of widening the circle of those who shall live and be happy?",
  "33718": "Why have they not seized me?",
  "33719": "When did it happen and what has happened?",
  "33720": "You see?",
  "33721": "How could we like a people who treated us so unjustly?",
  "33722": "When shall the day come when we shall lift our hands?",
  "33723": "Are you then making a thesis?",
  "33724": "Would you like me to bring some rice?",
  "33725": "Who do you want?",
  "33726": "How did he get 'em?",
  "33727": "And is my life to be forfeit, is some terrible punishment to come on my poor old head for that which I cannot help?",
  "33728": "You will be frank with me?",
  "33729": "And was that the head and front of his offending?",
  "33730": "And must he not be represented as such?",
  "33731": "But what's he doing here?",
  "33732": "While he indulged himself in this state, amidst a profound silence, the curate, approaching him with great reverence, asked him if he would not be pleased to honour him with his company at dinner?",
  "33733": "He said nothing more?",
  "33734": "And even if he has done wrong, how do I know that he has not condemned himself?",
  "33735": "And do they give you frogs to eat, so's to make you limber?",
  "33736": "A doctor?",
  "33737": "What did you do?",
  "33738": "Would he allow imitation to be the ruling principle of his life, as if he had nothing higher in him?",
  "33739": "That's what you tell this gentleman too, is it?",
  "33740": "He's your husband, eh?",
  "33741": "Can I spare him?",
  "33742": "What now?",
  "33743": "Armed?",
  "33744": "Or may not all three be properly allotted to it?",
  "33745": "Anything up?",
  "33746": "Is that so?",
  "33747": "You do not wish to hear it, perhaps?",
  "33748": "What does it matter to me?",
  "33749": "And will not a true astronomer have the same feeling when he looks at the movements of the stars?",
  "33750": "Why, what else are they?",
  "33751": "And s'pose he steps in here any minute, and sings out my name before I can throw him a wink to keep quiet?",
  "33752": "And the just is the good?",
  "33753": "How have I deviated from those principles, monsieur?",
  "33754": "But why FOUR pounds?",
  "33755": "And what did you find?",
  "33756": "What has he come here for?",
  "33757": "Are you inside?",
  "33758": "Downright?",
  "33759": "Do you think she'll miss you?",
  "33760": "Why was it necessary to weave the queen into this gloomy web of guilt and crime?",
  "33761": "I suppose that is why you live in town?",
  "33762": "What was the result of that memorable expedition?",
  "33763": "What, then, is the defence?",
  "33764": "What do you mean by risk?",
  "33765": "What would be the use?",
  "33766": "How could she make such nails work?",
  "33767": "Am I not the wife of my husband?",
  "33768": "What came after?",
  "33769": "Supposing her to be as good a woman as any you can find, which she certainly is not, why do you wish to connect yourself with anybody at present?",
  "33770": "What is the proposition?",
  "33771": "So?",
  "33772": "How is the snatchblatch?",
  "33773": "Just?",
  "33774": "Did you hear anything of it when you were in those parts?",
  "33775": "What is in this?",
  "33776": "And through what deplorable madness had she thus ruined her life by continual sacrifices?",
  "33777": "Where are the marks of its fangs?",
  "33778": "Who was this novice in war with the effrontery of a luminary?",
  "33779": "In my precinct?",
  "33780": "Is she, my lord?",
  "33781": "May this young lady go with us?",
  "33782": "Has no one come to seek her in this land?",
  "33783": "Then you'll be free?",
  "33784": "Monseigneur?",
  "33785": "Is it not sad?",
  "33786": "Can people enchant each other too much, cajole each other too much, charm each other too much?",
  "33787": "Why do they grease the axles of the wheels?",
  "33788": "If there be doubt as to which of our divisions will get our candidate, is there no doubt as to which of your candidates will get your party?",
  "33789": "What did you take me to your mother for?",
  "33790": "And did they ask you to make a speech?",
  "33791": "Some such object it was, that induced you to call on me?",
  "33792": "But how about money?",
  "33793": "You here at this hour?",
  "33794": "Well, then, was it this eye or that through which you dropped the beetle?",
  "33795": "What did your excellency say?",
  "33796": "Will you then swear to me, that you will never, under any pretext, and from any motive whatsoever, betray to anybody, so much as a single word of what I am now about to tell you?",
  "33797": "Where are you going, you rascal?",
  "33798": "Do you know, my friends, what that plain, seen from the height we are at, resembles?",
  "33799": "What was the good of bringing him?",
  "33800": "Where was it?",
  "33801": "Would she be decent to him, or would she scold him?",
  "33802": "Which is the best wish to wish him?",
  "33803": "How CAN you say 'I am happier,' and nothing changed?",
  "33804": "Why sadden the poor children, and damp their newly cherished hopes?",
  "33805": "And you feel convinced that you must break with him?",
  "33806": "Alone, where?",
  "33807": "And you saw him frequently?",
  "33808": "Why is she so glad?",
  "33809": "But why do you ask?",
  "33810": "What new treasures lay here for science to unfold?",
  "33811": "Rochester?",
  "33812": "What's coming on?",
  "33813": "Are we to wonder, then, if here and there we find in his works an offensive expression?",
  "33814": "Why not cut it?",
  "33815": "What does the letter mean, mother?",
  "33816": "Are we rising into a fiery furnace?",
  "33817": "What substances will you proscribe?",
  "33818": "And what method of surveillance do you employ?",
  "33819": "Oh, well, as it were, what?",
  "33820": "You think so?",
  "33821": "Of how much?",
  "33822": "But we could not prevent it, could we?",
  "33823": "You get your percentage out o' the purchase, I suppose?",
  "33824": "Food enough for all?",
  "33825": "Has she told you she likes me much?",
  "33826": "Why should I envy them?",
  "33827": "What did he say to you?",
  "33828": "But if he were taken back again he would imagine, and truly imagine, that he was descending?",
  "33829": "My friend, my friend, why thus grieve me?",
  "33830": "How does that strike you?",
  "33831": "Forty pounds?",
  "33832": "But I mean another piece?",
  "33833": "Are all voters enlightened?",
  "33834": "And his level, whether higher or lower, could it possibly be the same as hers?",
  "33835": "What makes you so sure?",

  "34005": "But the great point is, is there a 'Rita' on the list?",
  "34006": "Why should he not try rather to fortify himself, to add to his courtiers, to continually obtain new subsidies, and finally to free himself from dependence on the people, the inevitable goal of all power originating in the people?",
  "34007": "What was the difference whether the alms were given into my hands or into my wife's?",
  "34008": "Do you tell me that the woman is dead?",
  "34009": "Did he take that medicine, men?",
  "34010": "Who would suppose it?",
  "34011": "When was that done which settled the matter?",
  "34012": "What did you say, sir?",
  "34013": "Well and what am I to do now?",
  "34014": "What would be the result of a total extraction of the nitrogen?",

  "34023": "Do you belong to the nobility?",
  "34024": "D'you think they care for us?",
  "34025": "You bring me great news, then, monsieur?",
  "34026": "Did I say above, or seem to imply, that the judge sometimes spoke harshly to his wife?",
  "34027": "Not in health?",
  "34028": "And we have admitted that justice is the excellence of the soul, and injustice the defect of the soul?",
  "34029": "Did you really?",
  "34030": "What was he doing?",
  "34031": "Is he out of his senses?",
  "34032": "Who then?",

  "34067": "Has he many men, then?",
  "34068": "Will there be mercy for me there?",
  "34069": "I hope your father is well?",
  "34070": "Why then am I dissatisfied if I am going to do the things for which I exist and for which I was brought into the world?",
  "34071": "I tell you?",
  "34072": "You are no longer my father?",
  "34073": "And why, my young friend?",

  "34117": "Where do the lord and lady sleep?",
  "34118": "But whither am I wandering?",
  "34119": "With what kind of order?",
  "34120": "Why, then, refuse to follow to the end the road opened by science, and to admit an hypothesis which is the inevitable result of experience itself?",
  "34121": "But do you think we shall find the count at home?",
  "34122": "And what I am, to you my friends, now am I not?",
  "34123": "Do you conceive any thing but merely that perception?",
  "34124": "Who are these men you have brought before us?",
  "34125": "Some one holds you in restraint?",

  "34161": "What was the reply?",
  "34162": "Did business men commonly go into an expenditure of money which could be of no account to them?",
  "34163": "And then, in the next place, was it probable that the dean would act upon such a letter by filling up the vacancy, even if he did get it?",
  "34164": "And if not, WHO IS IN THE ROOM besides you and me?",
  "34165": "Must it of necessity be admitted that this power is infringed, so long as a part of the old articles remain?",
  "34166": "Had any papers been handed about among them, similar to these lists?",
  "34167": "Shall I go?",
  "34168": "On what charge do you expect to be arrested?",
  "34169": "But what can we expect from a turnip?",

  "34172": "Well, what happened when you did get there?",
  "34173": "You say two faces were familiar to you?",
  "34174": "You opened the letter?",
  "34175": "But what are all these birds doing in heaven?",
  "34176": "Is this, also, some enchanted person?",
  "34177": "But what was it?",
  "34178": "I mean to say, what?",
  "34179": "Ha, friend?",
  "34180": "And what about his wife and family?",
  "34181": "Is it necessary that a bourgeoisie which stands in such need of you should disown you?",
  "34182": "Suppose he were taken prisoner again?",
  "34183": "Now, my good fellow, how are you?",
  "34184": "She was about to say?",
  "34185": "Do you have a teaching?",
  "34186": "Has labor, once so fecund, likewise become sterile?",
  "34187": "Then what do you talk of?",
  "34188": "A signal for others?",
  "34189": "Who, and what are you?",

  "34196": "When did that happen?",
  "34197": "Are you sure they can be relied on?",
  "34198": "What will come of it all?",
  "34199": "Was there any mention made of my uncle or me?",
  "34200": "In what does it consist?",
  "34201": "Then I am not to be allowed to have anything to do with it officially?",
  "34202": "Can I go, can I go?",
  "34203": "Is she a friend of yours?",
  "34204": "Or will you be my friend, as you have been hitherto, and do what I request?",
  "34205": "Do you mean it?",
  "34206": "What is that queer concern going down the river?",
  "34207": "Was that all she said I said?",
  "34208": "But how cast off all the superfluous, devilish burden of my outer man?",
  "34209": "Why then is that rather a misfortune than this a good fortune?",
  "34210": "There now, what is it?",
  "34211": "Anything in the gruff and grumble way?",
  "34212": "Oh, my father, must your past career always interfere with my successes?",
  "34213": "Have I furnished it nicely?",
  "34214": "What am I doing here, anyway?",
  "34215": "From what causes do I derive my existence, and to what condition shall I return?",
  "34216": "Who put that paper there?",
  "34217": "Will you tell me what you're going to do with the skin?",
  "34218": "Do you suppose I am going to bring my ropes, my windlass, and set it up, and go down there with my boy and let myself be bitten, perhaps, by your cursed dog for the pleasure of giving it back to you?",
  "34219": "What will you do, then?",
  "34220": "What sort of a life could we build on such foundations?",
  "34221": "Ay, said I, but who can help constitution?",
  "34222": "Not chilled, pet, are you?",
  "34223": "Gone?",
  "34224": "Where had you seen me before?",
  "34225": "And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a fait accompli?",
  "34226": "And to sign the contract in three days?",
  "34227": "And that is your opinion?",

  "35187": "Now then, what do you say to that?",
  "35188": "Who, I, sir?",
  "35189": "What is there in the language of that speech which expresses such purpose or bears such construction?",

  "35206": "How long was it before you went to bed?",
  "35207": "Oh, you in front, what is blocking the way?",
  "35208": "He started by and by as if he were just then awakened, and asked who that was, and what was the matter?",
  "35209": "What are all the records of history, but narratives of successive villanies, of treasons and usurpations, massacres and wars?",
  "35210": "But how, sir, shall we dispose of you?",

  "35213": "What would?",
  "35214": "Do I?",
  "35215": "What happened next?",
  "35216": "Well, what is your opinion?",
  "35217": "Or, in spite of the opinion of the many, and in spite of consequences whether better or worse, shall we insist on the truth of what was then said, that injustice is always an evil and dishonour to him who acts unjustly?",
  "35218": "If all the drops in it were dried up, what would become of the sea?",

  "35220": "Do you know the condition I am in?",
  "35221": "Would the two, for his enlightenment, try to ascertain just what they had in common, and why they belonged to the same party?",
  "35222": "Should you go on that plan?",
  "35223": "If this development is equal, how is the power of reproduction lessened?",
  "35224": "It is in this direction, and I could come any afternoon by train for half an hour?",
  "35225": "Had he been indeed a man meanly jealous of fame, and capable of stooping to base and wicked arts for the purpose of injuring his competitors, would his vices have remained latent so long?",
  "35226": "Then why should I not go to his chambers?",
  "35227": "What do you want here?",
  "35228": "Why lie sprawling about the deck like this?",

  "36955": "And who's he?",
  "36956": "Does it interest you?",
  "36957": "What, my horse?",
  "36958": "Then he was certainly there?",
  "36959": "Surely your wife knew?",
  "36960": "Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?",
  "36961": "What is the reason of this sudden call?",
  "36962": "Do I find a fault, and nobody repairs it?",
  "36963": "Cried I, who carrieth his ashes unto the mountain?",
  "36964": "Is it a simple matter to keep silence?",
  "36965": "You have no faith in me?",
  "36966": "Is it any wonder that it rests with us now, with a bewildering sense of some power outside ourselves or our comprehension?",
  "36967": "How can you single out angels from among devils?",
  "36968": "Is it so very bad?",
  "36969": "Does that hurt you in any way?",
  "36970": "Shall I send the father to you?",
  "36971": "Are you quite alone, this year?",
  "36972": "Have I not given you to understand that, for a while at least, I would prefer to keep the contents of this epistle to myself?",
  "36973": "Can you say so?",
  "36974": "And here he proposed articles to you, I understand?",
  "36975": "The slab which closes the vault?",
  "36976": "How are matches made, except by bringing men and women together?",
  "36977": "Well, anyway, what ARE we going to do?",
  "36978": "But who is to carry you, said she, to your father and mother?",
  "36979": "You have nothing more to say?",
  "36980": "Who counsels best?",
  "36981": "What's the best place to stay at for the night round here?",
  "36982": "But whether made by one side or the other, would each side enjoy equal advantages on the trial?",
  "36983": "Not fear of the thunder, surely?",
  "36984": "Do you know he is a convict, a felon, a common thief?",
  "36985": "For what do they commemorate as concerns you and myself?",
  "36986": "Meaning that you saw none?",
  "36987": "Work?",
  "36988": "Were you much hurt?",
  "36989": "Do you still think you found somebody fairer?",
  "36990": "Did he steal?",
  "36991": "What stage have they reached, sir?",
  "36992": "Will no one come?",
  "36993": "Well, what?",
  "36994": "Had he a whip in his hand?",
  "36995": "When was there ever a time when he had experienced happiness, felt a true bliss?",
  "36996": "But can you not say that, sir?",
  "36997": "Why should I go back?",
  "36998": "Do you know what he did, sir?",
  "36999": "How far now can this negative mode of proceeding be carried?",
  "37000": "Why should you?",
  "37001": "And do you see that other one, who has an eagle and a dragon painted side by side upon his shield?",
  "37002": "Can I speak plainer?",
  "37003": "Who sent it?",
  "37004": "Will not a small body and a large one float the same way under the same influence?",
  "37005": "Can you give us any reason why we should not put you to death?",
  "37006": "Why had no word of any kind come from him?",
  "37007": "Made by whom?",
  "37008": "Have blows passed?",
  "37009": "And why was I so furious about it?",
  "37010": "Now, who was that someone?",
  "37011": "Who told you so?",
  "37012": "How long is this thing going on like this?",
  "37013": "How much did it cost him?",
  "37014": "How are we today?",
  "37015": "Need I recall either the scene or the national circumstances attending the occasion?",
  "37016": "You're ready, are you?",
  "37017": "Of whom speak you?",
  "37018": "Do you know?",
  "37019": "What am I saying?",
  "37020": "Might not that influence be altogether disastrous?",
  "37021": "What shall I say of this man?",
  "37022": "Is it not the impiety of the inhabitants?",
  "37023": "Was he carrying a hat?",
  "37024": "And the lustful and tyrannical desires are, as we saw, at the greatest distance?",
  "37025": "Who's there?",
  "37026": "When do you desire to go?",
  "37027": "The associate?",
  "37028": "But to whom, then?",
  "37029": "You feel strong enough to walk a little way now?",
  "37030": "What odds in that?",
  "37031": "And do you imagine he realizes all the awfulness of my position?",
  "37032": "Is the world, then, so narrow?",
  "37033": "When did music come this way?",
  "37034": "And what means have you to suggest, may I ask?",
  "37035": "What have we here?",
  "37036": "A spy?",
  "37037": "What are you worrying for, so long as he has money?",
  "37038": "Why did you ask me?",
  "37039": "What did these sealed mysterious letters bring him?",
  "37040": "How long will it take you to make up your mind?",
  "37041": "How of the window?",
  "37042": "And what did she for you?",
  "37043": "Well, how is your district council doing?",
  "37044": "Ought we not, then, to put our virtue and fortitude to the severest tests?",
  "37045": "May you come to me?",
  "37046": "What was his affair?",
  "37047": "Are you a magician?",
  "37048": "How long is it?",
  "37049": "Should you think all that pleasant enough if I forgave you?",
  "37050": "Were not these madmen common enough in such a prison?",
  "37051": "Of HIM?",
  "37052": "Is he hurt badly?",
  "37053": "What the devil is it all about?",
  "37054": "Does he now say that he did not make that promise?",
  "37055": "What was his name?",
  "37056": "Ferguson?",
  "37057": "Can it be that he was ashamed of me?",
  "37058": "Is it true, mother?",
  "37059": "Whither?",
  "37060": "Shall I open the secretary?",
  "37061": "In what respect, madame?",
  "37062": "But what is an energumen?",
  "37063": "Who is it bids me hold?",
  "37064": "May I ask where you have taken up your quarters?",
  "37065": "Or, indeed, I might perhaps get a clerkship in a merchant's office?",
  "37066": "Are you a merchant?",
  "37067": "What injury?",
  "37068": "Did I startle you?",
  "37069": "The horse?",
  "37070": "Where did you get THAT idea from?",
  "37071": "Have you ever seen a man hanged?",
  "37072": "Not even your aunt?",
  "37073": "How would it be possible to explain all this to a judge and jury, so that they might neither say that he was dishonest, nor yet that he was mad?",
  "37074": "Why did you not tell me?",
  "37075": "Do you recall her features distinctly?",
  "37076": "At such a tender age could he have been conscious of his uncle's superiority to all those who surrounded him?",
  "37077": "She had a son, that unhappy woman?",
  "37078": "What was the occasion of this excited assemblage?",
  "37079": "But at a tremendous discount, of course?",
  "37080": "You wish to speak to me about the circumstance which has just happened?",
  "37081": "Was I not just telling you I despised it?",
  "37082": "How has this been proved?",
  "37083": "Do you mind?",
  "37084": "What does it say?",
  "37085": "Then this table is free?",
  "37086": "Who raised the money?",
  "37087": "And what might you think?",
  "37088": "Perhaps you dislike it?",
  "37089": "You see all these bags at the back of my cart?",
  "37090": "Whether they were a rich or a poor corporation?",
  "37091": "And how does he behave towards travellers?",
  "37092": "Have you kept in touch with the market while you have been out of work?",
  "37093": "I then asked him what he intended to do with the knife which had been found upon him?",
  "37094": "Have you ever noticed how much a thing is heightened in value when we obtain possession of it?",
  "37095": "But why should he go through the ceremony if he is not to live with her?",
  "37096": "Oh, is that it?",
  "37097": "I do not know?",
  "37098": "And how could he know that I should be such a simpleton as to believe him?",
  "37099": "Are you so unsociable that you cannot make friends?",
  "37100": "Repeal this statute, my good sir?",
  "37101": "Will you make up your mind at last?",
  "37102": "Do I not know human nature?",
  "37103": "Must I wrap them up?",
  "37104": "If he was going to treat her like that why did he ask her to come and live at the flat?",
  "37105": "But how can I send him away, since I have given him a rendezvous?",
  "37106": "H'm?",
  "37107": "Ever so far?",
  "37108": "What are you doing there?",
  "37109": "And how have I broken that treaty, your excellency?",
  "37110": "How are you, old fellow?",
  "37111": "Sister?",
  "37112": "No misfortune has happened to the queen?",
  "37113": "You advise me, then, to be reconciled to the abbe?",
  "37114": "You too come to see them off?",
  "37115": "What is the meaning of yonder singular building?",
  "37116": "Have you brought his indentures with you?",
  "37117": "Is not ambition but an endless ladder by which no height is ever climbed till the last unreachable rung is mounted?",
  "37118": "Are you staying to talk?",
  "37119": "In what relation must she salute you as her uncle, or as her husband?",
  "37120": "Do the races or species of men, whichever term may be applied, encroach on and replace one another, so that some finally become extinct?",
  "37121": "Your crime?",
  "37122": "What have I been waiting for?",
  "37123": "Morrel?",
  "37124": "Or what does she mean?",
  "37125": "Has he got the financial basis arranged then?",
  "37126": "A little?",
  "37127": "Who goes there, yourselves?",
  "37128": "Will nothing of it remain?",
  "37129": "What will we get?",
  "37130": "But what's the use of talking of gorgeous rooms?",
  "37131": "Why did you sin?",
  "37132": "What necessity was there to expatiate on her brother's drunkenness?",
  "37133": "Could we lend you anything?",
  "37134": "I hope number two's as good?",
  "37135": "Are they weighing the shekels of the tabernacle ?",
  "37136": "Is it all past over?",
  "37137": "My heart, who is there upon earth that I could miss so much?",
  "37138": "If it is I you do love, O how can it be that you look and speak so?",
  "37139": "Shall I clamber across, or will you come to the plank above here?",
  "37140": "Have they calculated upon the inevitable consequences of this abdication?",
  "37141": "Plural?",
  "37142": "Why no king?",
  "37143": "Why had her family cast her off?",
  "37144": "And what will you do in that case?",
  "37145": "Why?",
  "37146": "Were they good to you?",
  "37147": "And why not?",
  "37148": "Whither shall I fly?",
  "37149": "Where is such an education as this to be had?",
  "37150": "Have you any more business here?",
  "37151": "You would follow the escort?",
  "37152": "Are you superhuman?",
  "37153": "But what good effect can the latter mode of worship have on the moral conduct of a rational being?",
  "37154": "Why, how, when my money is gone, my complexion gone, my life gone, and my slipper gone?",
  "37155": "Do we desire to make such ruthless combinations and monopolies lawful?",
  "37156": "Whose sword?",
  "37157": "There, do you hear?",
  "37158": "You do believe in my grandmother, then?",
  "37159": "Do you feel ill, sir?",
  "37160": "How did that ivory come all this way?",
  "37161": "Is there confusion in the little isle?",
  "37162": "What lay behind it or within it?",
  "37163": "Why have they not been here?",
  "37164": "But, doctor, you are not going to quarrel with us?",
  "37165": "What the devil are you driving at?",
  "37166": "When did it come to your knowledge?",
  "37167": "You do not comprehend ?",
  "37168": "Do you swear it?",
  "37169": "With your lasso you could stop an ox?",
  "37170": "Why, what do you call yourselves?",
  "37171": "And the corpse?",
  "37172": "You will give me your hand, will you not?",
  "37173": "Was it a girl or a boy?",
  "37174": "From whom?",
  "37175": "Why had she bidden him to come early if she was having people to dine?",
  "37176": "Was it yesterday?",
  "37177": "Shall I see something very uncommon?",
  "37178": "Could she see?",
  "37179": "Are those all they've left us?",
  "37180": "All?",
  "37181": "Where was now the dwarf?",
  "37182": "Was that so?",
  "37183": "What hideous, furtive hand is that which is slipped into the pocket of victory?",
  "37184": "Do you know who the other is?",
  "37185": "And does the essence of the invariable partake of knowledge in the same degree as of essence?",
  "37186": "Why will you ask me to do these things?",
  "37187": "With what view?",
  "37188": "What have you against me?",
  "37189": "Are you going much farther?",
  "37190": "How nothing?",
  "37191": "Were you in that lighter?",
  "37192": "What came of such an event?",
  "37193": "Why stop?",

  "37196": "Are we descending?",
  "37197": "First of all, if he had left it complete, would sixteen years have gone by before it was printed?",
  "37198": "Where would you put this?",
  "37199": "Who insists?",
  "37200": "Do they droop and end their lesson, wearied over there beyond the seas?",
  "37201": "Or to do anything?",
  "37202": "Why, is that your name?",
  "37203": "Wherefore ruin so fair a body?",
  "37204": "And who was the first?",
  "37205": "Do you promise?",
  "37206": "She is modest enough to love even you?",

  "37213": "And why did he bob and beat you, sirrah?",
  "37214": "What collection of facts is scanty?",
  "37215": "How shall the government, which by the hypothesis is everything, become an obedient servant, a subordinate organ?",

  "37218": "Is it really you?",
  "37219": "Love it?",
  "37220": "What shall I do, mamma?",
  "37221": "What's all this about diamonds?",
  "37222": "Why did you come between my love and me?",
  "37223": "When such as I, who have no certain roof but the coffinlid, and no friend in sickness or death but the hospital nurse, set our rotten hearts on any man, and let him fill the place that has been a blank through all our wretched lives, who can hope to cure us?",
  "37224": "He has obtained the decoration for me?",
  "37225": "If that be so, what must she think of me if I stay away from her now?",
  "37226": "Shall it be a week, a month, a year?",
  "37227": "But if they had quarrelled so bitterly, why had her father the very next day urged her to marry him?",
  "37228": "What is to be done?",
  "37229": "Was she paintable?",
  "37230": "And then, whither was he to go?",
  "37231": "How long have I been mad?",
  "37232": "Why have we no father, like other boys?",
  "37233": "Who would recognize him now?",
  "37234": "And when was the engagement actually settled?",
  "37235": "You have never been a companion before, have you?",
  "37236": "How did you hear of him?",
  "37237": "Why should they not do good?",
  "37238": "Where, then, lies the solution of the social problem?",
  "37239": "Then there is no cure for it?",
  "37240": "Does not this appear strange to you?",
  "37241": "And, anyway, how did he know?",
  "37242": "How is it you're only just qualified?",
  "37243": "What book?",
  "37244": "Bobbsey?",
  "37245": "Are you a subject for the mad hospital?",

  "37252": "Fight our way through?",
  "37253": "Me get married?",
  "37254": "Then you admit you have arrested me?",
  "37255": "Have you made the tour of the mansion?",
  "37256": "You knew the poor lad, then?",
  "37257": "What know you of him, cousin?",

  "37259": "Do you dance?",
  "37260": "Has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant?",
  "37261": "What depth have we?",
  "37262": "Is not this a sale of the right to travel?",
  "37263": "Why, what did she mean by that?",
  "37264": "Odorem pudendorum amicæ?",
  "37265": "What will happen if I try to divide this estate decently among decent people?",
  "37266": "But I say, you know, what about me?",
  "37267": "When is the war to commence?",
  "37268": "You do not know?",
  "37269": "They who suffer me to remain may in a moment drive me away, and can I hope my persecutors, seeing me happy, will leave me here to continue to be so?",
  "37270": "How do you like your work?",
  "37271": "Steady?",
  "37272": "Was it natural, was it effort?",
  "37273": "Kin you keep awake that long?",
  "37274": "Now, does that signify a jot?",
  "37275": "Are you too harsh and rough?",
  "37276": "Is the fool drunk?",
  "37277": "Shall I strike that?",
  "37278": "When have you found me unmindful of your lessons?",
  "37279": "But I would ask you how did this man know that you lived here, or how to get into your house, or where to hide to get you?",
  "37280": "Did you forbid them to come?",
  "37281": "An old woman?",
  "37282": "And do you?",
  "37283": "You do not, I suppose, want our horses to clamber up on the roof of the carriage in front of us?",
  "37284": "Where has he gone?",
  "37285": "How much have you a year?",
  "37286": "You WILL put it to her yourself then?",
  "37287": "Would he have been doing that?",
  "37288": "What could all this mean?",
  "37289": "With your uncle?",
  "37290": "Has your husband written to you yet?",
  "37291": "At what o'clock did the battle begin?",
  "37292": "Which prison is he from?",
  "37293": "Whom have we got?",
  "37294": "Why do you shake your head and look so glum?",
  "37295": "How long is the coffin?",
  "37296": "What do men usually say to cabmen?",
  "37297": "To whom can they go?",
  "37298": "Do you smoke, child?",
  "37299": "But had it been bad, why should we pronounce it dishonest?",
  "37300": "What do I lack in your eyes?",
  "37301": "Then what is the theory in your mind?",
  "37302": "Murderers of whom?",
  "37303": "To be put to death by mine own people, and render my memory a disgrace to my family and my nation?",
  "37304": "Why did she bear a grateful heart because they had met, and feel it pain to think that they would shortly part?",
  "37305": "You have been going often yourself, then, lately?",
  "37306": "Does any one dare to slander me?",
  "37307": "And is the satisfaction derived from that which has less or from that which has more existence the truer?",
  "37308": "How am I to live?",
  "37309": "Fot is dat to me?",
  "37310": "You were saying this, were you not?",
  "37311": "And to spare one's family the publicity, the scandal?",
  "37312": "Why are these things permitted?",
  "37313": "How would fifty guineas for a night's work suit you?",
  "37314": "Could you tell her so for me, with my fervent acknowledgments?",
  "37315": "Have you no need of my services, sir?",
  "37316": "Are you also the victim of a treachery?",
  "37317": "Is any one hurt?",
  "37318": "Was there no possibility of sending to fetch him if it were only for an instant, or forwarding to him one line of writing to which he might return a verbal reply?",
  "37319": "What's the use of it?",
  "37320": "Do you think I should find it interesting?",
  "37321": "But what is the good of friendship if one cannot say exactly what one means?",
  "37322": "Am I in better case?",
  "37323": "Spit three or fourscore ounces?",
  "37324": "Did he say that in his hearing?",
  "37325": "Ridiculous?",
  "37326": "You have heard what I said?",
  "37327": "What shall we do after dinner?",
  "37328": "How can you prove that?",

  "37741": "What ideas have they been filling your head with, you young girls of today?",
  "37742": "Was it worth while to wish me to swear this morning that I would mention the appointment to no one?",
  "37743": "Or what is it commonly, that gives us any participation in it, even while alive and present, but our affection and regard to him?",
  "37744": "Could you give me the facts which prompted you to telegraph?",
  "37745": "Tib?",
  "37746": "Will you give me one of the cakes you are carrying?",
  "37747": "And no ba'dy gaieties, I suppose?",
  "37748": "And that, you think, is a bad sign?",
  "37749": "Run after?",
  "37750": "All out?",
  "37751": "Who made it to be like that, a bestial part of the body able to understand bestially and desire bestially?",
  "37752": "Does the court accompany him?",
  "37753": "Are you sure there's nothing you'll want?",
  "37754": "What's the blow now?",
  "37755": "Returning?",
  "37756": "No carriages or horses?",
  "37757": "But to what?",
  "37758": "Where do you feel bad?",
  "37759": "You must guess what I should like best, do you hear?",
  "37760": "What then is the real object of them?",
  "37761": "Is there anything else you wish to retrench or alter, gentlemen?",
  "37762": "They say you played cards with her?",
  "37763": "Who is there who has not felt all these things?",
  "37764": "Is that all, monsieur?",
  "37765": "Is there any particular feeling on that head?",
  "37766": "Shooting, sir?",
  "37767": "Misgivings as to what?",

  "37769": "And when I tell you that it is my business, mine of right, does that go for nothing with you?",
  "37770": "And yet you were acknowledging a little while ago that knowledge is not the same as opinion?",
  "37771": "Do you not see that society is dissolving, that a spirit of infatuation is carrying us away?",
  "37772": "Well, it's very pleasant to have you back again, and you understand all about art now, eh?",
  "37773": "And would you know what I would do unto him?",

  "37784": "What is it you'll tell?",
  "37785": "What is she thinking?",
  "37786": "Was it this voice, or at all like this voice?",
  "37787": "What was the question you put to the officer at the gate?",
  "37788": "Could we handle that dumb thing, or would it handle us?",
  "37789": "What, then, was the change which now took place?",
  "37790": "Of what other things have you got hold?",
  "37791": "Do you take it for a printed book, you ignorant fool?",
  "37792": "How could you presume to come here on such an errand, you scoundrel?",
  "37793": "You have been in the habit now of reading to your father, and those people I found you among, I dare say?",
  "37794": "What earthly right have you to use such language to me?",
  "37795": "And now what is their manner of life, and what sort of a government have they?",
  "37796": "And that one?",
  "37797": "And if we refuse?",
  "37798": "And the young should be trained in both kinds, and we begin with the false?",
  "37799": "Did you leave her pretty jolly?",
  "37800": "Or do you think that my having been unfortunate is a sufficient reason why our relative positions should be changed, and that she should command and I should obey?",
  "37801": "Do you understand what you're saying?",
  "37802": "Upon your soul?",
  "37803": "Have you a boat?",
  "37804": "How could he face her now?",

  "37806": "I know not whether he be truly virtuous, but why should he show readiness of the tongue?",
  "37807": "Should they have any milk?",
  "37808": "Fix'd in the heart, how can the heart forget her?",
  "37809": "That young man who was to be burned yesterday, was your son?",
  "37810": "Who can help it?",
  "37811": "How far off?",
  "37812": "For the misplaced expression?",
  "37813": "You have tied him up well, hein?",
  "37814": "Where got you that wit?",
  "37815": "Then why have you not sung before?",
  "37816": "You hear?",
  "37817": "Could she help giving her hand to the man who had won her heart?",
  "37818": "About what?",
  "37819": "Then they are saved?",
  "37820": "Why should you not be open with me?",
  "37821": "Do you remember no woman, no kind woman, who hung over you once, and kissed your lips, and called you her child?",
  "37822": "What is the use of talking of it?",
  "37823": "Where, to the launch?",
  "37824": "What do men talk about when they sit out?",
  "37825": "And who are my brethren?",

  "37833": "But how get married?",
  "37834": "Between them?",
  "37835": "Danger?",
  "37836": "Is not the wall built strong enough, and is not the tower sufficiently strong and high?",
  "37837": "The increase of which lust in liberty, together with the present trade of the stage, in all their miscelline interludes, what learned or liberal soul doth not already abhor?",
  "37838": "What is it you are saying?",
  "37839": "Do you think he remembers me?",
  "37840": "My niece is not with you by any chance?",
  "37841": "What could I hardly be expected to undergo?",
  "37842": "Now, what must I give you to agree to this?",
  "37843": "Is it enough?",
  "37844": "A large scale map, I presume?",
  "37845": "What am I accused of?",
  "37846": "Where can he have come from?",
  "37847": "Can any one comprehend such a thing?",
  "37848": "Yours?",
  "37849": "Is he one of them, do you think?",
  "37850": "Did not that king accept of money from our king on this condition, that he should not destroy the city, and yet, contrary to the oath he had taken, he came down to burn the temple?",
  "37851": "You love me, my beautiful queen, and you will weep for me?",
  "37852": "Where am I to go?",
  "37853": "Or a drop of dew?",
  "37854": "Found your way back at last, have you?",

  "37861": "I know it meets your approval?",
  "37862": "Your highness's signature?",
  "37863": "Why so many precautions?",
  "37864": "You have seen how it was fastened about my throat?",
  "37865": "Omen?",
  "37866": "How cast off?",
  "37867": "Why did I not think of bringing provisions?",
  "37868": "Gone into my house?",
  "37869": "Has her case been heard or not?",
  "37870": "Has this action of hers not set me free?",
  "37871": "Must I go?",

  "38139": "Thinking again?",
  "38140": "What's he like?",
  "38141": "I have already recorded sentence of death, five or six times, against the movers of political conspiracies, and who can say how many daggers may be ready sharpened, and only waiting a favorable opportunity to be buried in my heart?",
  "38142": "Then it was not till your return to the ship that you put the letter in the portfolio?",
  "38143": "Are my children all there?",
  "38144": "It seems he addressed the young man first, threatening him with his vengeance for having trespassed on his demesnes, and asking him if he knew in whose presence he stood?",
  "38145": "How could he make the man understand?",
  "38146": "Are you cold?",
  "38147": "How could he spring away with his four legs in the air above him?",
  "38148": "Why do you tie up your bell?",
  "38149": "What was degrading?",
  "38150": "What am I fit for?",
  "38151": "In that respect, what made you of him?",
  "38152": "Would you like me to show you?",
  "38153": "What difference does it make?",
  "38154": "Well, would you like to look round the cells now?",
  "38155": "Whatever have I done?",
  "38156": "Am I not encompassed with the banners of a potent and invincible army?",

  "38169": "But then, why did he marry her?",
  "38170": "Where does this path lead to?",
  "38171": "But the willow bark?",
  "38172": "Can it have been only a momentary mood, and will it pass and leave no trace?",
  "38173": "Why did he not tell them he knew nothing about this affair?",
  "38174": "Was it true what that man said?",
  "38175": "Well, how am I so?",
  "38176": "Tell me also about my father, and the son whom I left behind me, is my property still in their hands, or has some one else got hold of it, who thinks that I shall not return to claim it?",

  "38188": "Are you making fun of me?",
  "38189": "What is it that I can do then?",
  "38190": "And why, sire?",

  "38204": "Was he?",
  "38205": "Were you quite comfortable?",
  "38206": "How can I advise him?",
  "38207": "Doth not he die like a good fellow that dies with a stiff catso?",
  "38208": "Could I behold this and live?",
  "38209": "What document?",
  "38210": "What could she say?",
  "38211": "Is it as bad as that?",
  "38212": "Was that all that prevented you?",
  "38213": "You ate it?",
  "38214": "These then may be truly said to be the ends of these organs?",

  "38230": "Impossible?",
  "38231": "And he who lives well is blessed and happy, and he who lives ill the reverse of happy?",
  "38232": "Do you never catch cold?",
  "38233": "At it again?",
  "38234": "I married?",
  "38235": "In this flowing stream then, on which there is no abiding, what is there of the things which hurry by on which a man would set a high price?",
  "38236": "If this be so, how can I, who love you, wish for such a marriage?",
  "38237": "What has happened, dear lady?",
  "38238": "Why is all this, except from the utter ignorance as to the simplest laws of their own animal life, which prevails among even the most highly educated persons in this country?",
  "38239": "Sure he saw the prisoner with these lists?",
  "38240": "Why do you not come back to her?",
  "38241": "Why was this man off here alone?",
  "38242": "In what has the chevalier been inconsiderate enough to displease your majesty?",
  "38243": "And why not, captain?",
  "38244": "What do you mean by using the will properly?",
  "38245": "How, then, shall we find the relation between two unknowns which, according to political economy, cannot be determined?",
  "38246": "Where are you taking him at that speed?",
  "38247": "Where are the other papers?",
  "38248": "Can he box?",
  "38249": "And why had she made it so cold?",
  "38250": "By what means shall we fortify against it?",
  "38251": "Do you remember your promise yesterday to give me a kiss?",
  "38252": "What is a guardian for?",
  "38253": "You swear to me, my father, that no danger threatens him if he comes?",
  "38254": "Do you not think that there are things which you cannot understand, and yet which are, that some people see things that others cannot?",
  "38255": "How could that be, if the cost of the national workshops is higher than that of the free workshops?",
  "38256": "Well then, you must know I mean have you had any desire to do what cannot be avoided?",
  "38257": "On what, then, have you relied, legislators?",
  "38258": "Have you never felt one little bit of what you used to feel when we were at the dairy?",
  "38259": "Is no distinction to be made in the intensity of desires?",
  "38260": "Willoughby, where was your heart when you wrote those words?",
  "38261": "And now I'm all right again?",
  "38262": "Can I do more?",
  "38263": "Are these her rooms?",

  "38265": "What is all human conduct but the daily and hourly sale of our souls for trifles?",
  "38266": "Is it not very reasonable, therefore, she should cultivate both?",
  "38267": "Could you help us at all?",

  "38271": "Could there be any meat that is not fresh in my shop?",
  "38272": "What in the world did you do to him?",
  "38273": "What's the matter?",
  "38274": "Mousqueton is here, then?",
  "38275": "What visitor did you turn away from my door, about an hour ago?",
  "38276": "What else do you think he could say?",
  "38277": "Well, and what about you?",
  "38278": "What is your judgement?",
  "38279": "Oh, are they wanted?",
  "38280": "How comes all this, if there be not something puissant in whaling?",
  "38281": "Where, then, is the contradiction?",

  "38301": "Had she not emptied his store into her lap?",
  "38302": "Professor, are you in earnest, or is it some monstrous joke?",
  "38303": "Not even you?",
  "38304": "Whether the punishment will be greater on him, who, in this case, innocently dies, or on him whom sad necessity forces to retaliate, is, in the nicety of sensation, an undecided question?",

  "38404": "How came you to court her?",
  "38405": "Were you never given any sort of an education?",
  "38406": "Then we may form our opinion?",
  "38407": "Ought I not to begin by describing how the change from timocracy to oligarchy arises?",
  "38408": "Are you for it?",
  "38409": "Snagsby?",
  "38410": "How, and why?",
  "38411": "Well, monsieur, do you know who this great lady is?",
  "38412": "Is it the mere force of life which is determined to be, or the consciousness of self which cannot be got rid of, or the fire of genius which refuses to be extinguished?",
  "38413": "Under my clothes?",
  "38414": "Have you no supper, brother?",
  "38415": "Where are we?",
  "38416": "What did she have to say?",
  "38417": "Wherefore?",

  "38433": "How much may it come to?",
  "38434": "Ye preach patience with what is earthly?",
  "38435": "And you laid the foundation of your fortune in the midst of all those songs?",
  "38436": "Would it be a very hard lesson, dear?",

  "38445": "Seriously, can that be applied to a man of income, who has no other possession under the sun than the market, and in his pocket his money?",
  "38446": "Whereabouts were his former haunts?",
  "38447": "Will you stop smiling in that inscrutable way and tell me what you mean?",
  "38448": "Whose is that letter of your mistress?",
  "38449": "Is this not purely good?",
  "38450": "Are you trying to frighten me?",
  "38451": "How, could anyone get into his room?",
  "38452": "I like a booby was crying, can you beat it?",

  "38459": "What should one love and what hate?",
  "38460": "If it was true, why was it not writ till five days after the proclamation?",
  "38461": "Or because a man is in good health when he receives pay you would not say that the art of payment is medicine?",
  "38462": "Why are you so glum?",
  "38463": "Even among the poor, who would willingly marry the child of a man who had been hanged?",
  "38464": "Who and what are you, and why are you here?",
  "38465": "And he was guilty?",
  "38466": "Gone out?",
  "38467": "A whole scene?",
  "38468": "Did you have any trouble sneaking them away?",
  "38469": "Earth being so good, would heaven seem best?",
  "38470": "And if that be enchantment, as your worship says, was there no other pair in the world for them to take the likeness of?",
  "38471": "What is a kiss?",
  "38472": "My dear girl, what has he done?",
  "38473": "If it should turn out to be all wrong?",
  "38474": "Is there any external evidence to support this grave accusation?",
  "38475": "Tim, you villain, what do you say to that, sir?",
  "38476": "Why give that?",
  "38477": "Did you ever see anything more perfect than her acting?",
  "38478": "And how long will it take you to reach home?",
  "38479": "And we are pursuing the duke with the very horses he has just left?",
  "38480": "Where was there any proof to the contrary?",
  "38481": "Oh, what's that?",
  "38482": "Did you fall from heaven?",
  "38483": "Is it not a greater service to place souls in heaven than to bury bodies in the earth?",
  "38484": "What the devil do you mean?",
  "38485": "Leave any for him?",
  "38486": "Your second condition for going, if you please, sister?",
  "38487": "Have you gone out of your wits in your office?",
  "38488": "Who is to know who was everybody's father?",
  "38489": "But would any number of men hare dreamed of resorting to such an expedient?",
  "38490": "Repeal it, my dear sir?",

  "38499": "And what do you believe?",
  "38500": "My shadow calleth me?",
  "38501": "Not in this place, surely?",
  "38502": "For why should the slaughter of an ox or a sheep be a greater wrong than the felling of a fir or an oak, seeing that a soul is implanted in these trees also?",
  "38503": "Did not your majesty say so?",
  "38504": "Have I your leave to go, dear?",
  "38505": "But are your beliefs, we should ask, based on historical fact?",
  "38506": "Tell me what?",
  "38507": "Glory waits our toil?",
  "38508": "Am I queer?",
  "38509": "So much?",
  "38510": "So that you may be avoided?",
  "38511": "Is it a hoax?",

  "38519": "Quite free, my lady?",
  "38520": "But why was the ship coming there?",
  "38521": "And is not a similar method to be pursued about the virtues, which are also four in number?",
  "38522": "Do you really travel through time?",
  "38523": "Could their fragile boat hold out on a long trip?",
  "38524": "You are going, then?",

  "38913": "Is that all true?",
  "38914": "Can we not escape from this country?",
  "38915": "What shall we do now?",
  "38916": "But when I tell you I am married, is it not a consequence that we must have new clothes?",
  "38917": "You know it well, then?",
  "38918": "A lover on a day of farewell, a husband on a day of revenge, or the one whose head it had graced on the day of despair?",

  "39313": "But you know the little inn, three miles off, near the trout stream?",
  "39314": "Cares also, I expect?",
  "39315": "What is it that is magnificent?",
  "39316": "What is the matter, my dear?",
  "39317": "May I ask how I can help you?",
  "39318": "And where on earth can a man have peace and rest if not in a deanery?",
  "39319": "What is it here?",
  "39320": "But why have they all agreed to speak just in the same manner always the dreariest and most useless stuff?",
  "39321": "What right have you, in the circumstances, to BE on any other ground?",
  "39322": "Did not the penitent yet feel himself pardoned, either in his own eyes or in the eyes of others?",
  "39323": "Nay, that he can almost work a miracle?",
  "39324": "Did I not recall you to life?",
  "39325": "Between whom was the compact?",
  "39326": "Is it as hopeless as he thinks?",
  "39327": "Do we not find her among beasts even, and among reptiles?",
  "39328": "What are you afraid of here, with me?",
  "39329": "Now, who will be next served?",
  "39330": "Oh, that was it, was it?",
  "39331": "If the past is not to bind us, where can duty lie?",
  "39332": "Then it will disappear some day?",
  "39333": "Who cares for you?",
  "39334": "Is that confidence to be imparted to me soon?",
  "39335": "What do I care?",
  "39336": "Why should the marriageable age of the latter be fixed at eighteen years, while that of the former is postponed until thirty?",
  "39337": "Why be in such a hurry?",
  "39338": "The inn?",
  "39339": "What do you mean by saying I shall have them?",
  "39340": "Where, if not in upper chambers, did the young princesses repose?",
  "39341": "What is my joy if all hands, even the unclean, can reach into it?",
  "39342": "MUST there not be such philosophers some day?",
  "39343": "What is the subject of the picture?",
  "39344": "How now ought I to call them?",
  "39345": "But if I've seen it myself?",
  "39346": "Is the abbe at home?",
  "39347": "Had they no men to help them?",
  "39348": "If not recruited and rested then, when could they ever be?",
  "39349": "Who has bread to sell?",
  "39350": "Do you suppose the public reads with a view to its own conversion?",
  "39351": "Why is he visiting there as a confidential friend, when he never ought to have been admitted inside the house?",
  "39352": "What outlines are seen in trees at a distance against the sky which serves as their background?",
  "39353": "Will you allow me to make one observation, sir?",
  "39354": "He has told you what has passed between himself and my husband?",
  "39355": "Why had he fought the marauder?",
  "39356": "Has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window?",
  "39357": "Do the hounds frighten you so?",
  "39358": "Is my carriage ready?",
  "39359": "Now, have I your leave to depart?",
  "39360": "Must I take anything with me?",
  "39361": "Who is not, marquise?",
  "39362": "And what's to be done?",
  "39363": "Why do you live on the bank of a river?",
  "39364": "Have you been on the moor already?",
  "39365": "Well, have you at last decided on anything?",
  "39366": "Can they exclude it then?",
  "39367": "What, then, has been the foundation of all this controversy?",
  "39368": "Oswald, what is the matter?",
  "39369": "Who still wanteth to rule?",
  "39370": "Call for me at eight o'clock or shall I wait supper for you at seven?",
  "39371": "Down the staircase and along the corridors or to his room at the end?",
  "39372": "If you are not handsome, what then?",
  "39373": "What is it you depend on?",
  "39374": "And how am I to do so?",
  "39375": "And what do you make of it?",
  "39376": "But could a child of that age have a soul like that?",
  "39377": "Let him slip through our hands?",
  "39378": "Maggie only worst then?",
  "39379": "What's wrong with it?",
  "39380": "Some other man, then?",
  "39381": "You have just come down?",
  "39382": "Would you march at the head of your musketeers, with your sword in your hand, to observe any spot whatever, or an enemy's position?",
  "39383": "Is it likely that the trouble of one wife and mother would be much to us now?",
  "39384": "Come?",
  "39385": "Of the magicians and genii?",
  "39386": "Who's making personal remarks now?",
  "39387": "You admit that?",
  "39388": "Is your honour looking for a boat?",
  "39389": "Shall we form a business partnership?",
  "39390": "Will you join us?",
  "39391": "What are the advantages promised to counterbalance these disadvantages?",
  "39392": "Why did that fool allow himself to die of hunger with sixty years of unlived life before him?",
  "39393": "Whom did she murder?",
  "39394": "Did you give the letter?",
  "39395": "I suppose you have not heard that one young man levanted last year to save himself from a breach of promise case?",
  "39396": "Well, are we going for the children?",
  "39397": "Is that all?",
  "39398": "But who was present?",
  "39399": "Under a pretext of luxury would you like to establish new classes of citizens?",
  "39400": "What else have I that I can think of?",

  "39402": "Now are you happy again?",
  "39403": "Ah yes, and what else did he say that's unpleasant?",
  "39404": "That's what I'm to do, is it?",
  "39405": "Vronsky?",
  "39406": "Where did you get this ring?",
  "39407": "Age?",
  "39408": "Have you never loved ANYBODY in all your life, uncle?",
  "39409": "Will you pay me, sir?",
  "39410": "Is she gone?",
  "39411": "Tom?",
  "39412": "Who was the better for it?",
  "39413": "How long is it since I rented your house?",
  "39414": "Oh, that's the trouble is it?",
  "39415": "Has she heard?",
  "39416": "Why do you wish to know?",
  "39417": "Could he not squeeze under the seat of a carriage?",
  "39418": "Or what does he know about anything for that matter?",
  "39419": "Do you mean to refuse me altogether?",
  "39420": "Why do you ask?",
  "39421": "Is not death in my house?",
  "39422": "There is not room for one more?",
  "39423": "Has your debt been paid you?",
  "39424": "Then what brought you among our enemies?",
  "39425": "Have I at least convinced you, sire?",
  "39426": "A crook?",
  "39427": "What am I to say to her?",
  "39428": "All this time?",
  "39429": "Do you admit that education is a benefit for the people?",
  "39430": "So will you, PLEASE will you, keep from questioning me?",
  "39431": "And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose?",
  "39432": "The murderer?",
  "39433": "And to attend the court no more?",
  "39434": "And have you been here long?",
  "39435": "What have I done, and what could I do?",
  "39436": "Who is mourning for the daughter?",
  "39437": "Will it hurt?",
  "39438": "Has there been any paramour who disgraced himself that lie might help his neighbours?",
  "39439": "But, comrades, what shall we do now?",
  "39440": "About what, mother?",
  "39441": "If this assertion be true, is it not a useless task to educate man with the purpose of making him better and nobler?",
  "39442": "Where was it?",
  "39443": "In such cases, who is to decide, the living or the dead?",
  "39444": "How did that come about?",
  "39445": "Not going at all?",
  "39446": "Did you say those words to her?",
  "39447": "Whuzzamatter whiz you?",
  "39448": "Gentle count, brave soldier, where are you?",
  "39449": "But why this question?",
  "39450": "Was it not too horrible?",
  "39451": "You really think so?",
  "39452": "Had you doubted it, then?",
  "39453": "Do you hear how he's walking?",
  "39454": "But why do I argue thus?",
  "39455": "A letter?",
  "39456": "You mean of family ties?",
  "39457": "Did she eat or drink here?",
  "39458": "What in the devil is the matter with you, my friend?",
  "39459": "How then?",
  "39460": "Do you know it or not?",
  "39461": "You see, I destroy it?",
  "39462": "Will you not wait and breakfast?",
  "39463": "To refresh me?",
  "39464": "Are you supporting them also?",
  "39465": "This varnish?",
  "39466": "And on what floor does he live?",
  "39467": "Why so positive?",
  "39468": "Has he ever whaled it any?",
  "39469": "And, more especially, can he pass unfriendly legislation to violate his oath?",
  "39470": "Who's here?",
  "39471": "Now, when he is in this state of mind, if some one gently comes to him and tells him that he is a fool and must get understanding, which can only be got by slaving for it, do you think that, under such adverse circumstances, he will be easily induced to listen?",
  "39472": "What shall be said of these?",
  "39473": "You cannot tell me?",
  "39474": "Where'd you get the blue ticket?",
  "39475": "Surely will my last night's dream be realised?",
  "39476": "Where was he going?",
  "39477": "Stoepel?",
  "39478": "But why should I be there rather than in this beautiful room?",
  "39479": "How well are the machine sheds at the barracks guarded?",
  "39480": "Had you had a row?",
  "39481": "What has it all been about?",
  "39482": "Why did you not darken your light, that he might be stricken with horror at his crime?",
  "39483": "After this?",
  "39484": "Before the boy comes?",
  "39485": "But why need I wear spectacles?",
  "39486": "Where then do you mean to take refuge?",
  "39487": "What are you going to do with him, assuming that you've got him?",
  "39488": "After a pause of several minutes, their silence was broken, by his asking her in a voice of some agitation, when he was to congratulate her on the acquisition of a brother?",
  "39489": "And what did you say to her?",
  "39490": "Why mine?",
  "39491": "Did no one examine?",
  "39492": "Would that be right?",
  "39493": "And how did you verify them?",
  "39494": "Will you be frank, very frank with me?",
  "39495": "Whither should I go?",
  "39496": "Now tell I tell you something?",
  "39497": "Whose voice was that?",
  "39498": "What will happen, then?",
  "39499": "Did he give his name?",
  "39500": "And where is the consulate?",
  "39501": "Why does he let things be so?",
  "39502": "Singly?",
  "39503": "Mary what, then?",
  "39504": "Are you going?",
  "39505": "I suppose you were a gentleman, then, as well as now?",
  "39506": "Will you be pleased to hang me?",
  "39507": "Camp in a bog, would you?",
  "39508": "Ah what's this I smell?",
  "39509": "And why am I disturbed, for the dispersion of my elements will happen whatever I do?",
  "39510": "Do you doubt it?",
  "39511": "But why not, my dear?",
  "39512": "But how did he account for it?",
  "39513": "Danae means a shower of gold, does it not?",
  "39514": "And in that case they will be right in doing good to the evil and evil to the good?",
  "39515": "Would I reflect on the price?",
  "39516": "Does anyone know where it is?",
  "39517": "Perhaps, gentlemen, if he had not said this in your presence and I had reported it, you'd have held this to be impossible likewise, eh?",
  "39518": "As to arming them, how is that to be done?",
  "39519": "How long ago?",
  "39520": "What pickpockets are they who ply their trade in the rear of glory?",
  "39521": "Will not the three men be found?",
  "39522": "What are they doin' THERE, for gracious sakes?",
  "39523": "How is it that that name rises upon all occasions to torment my ears, during the last two or three days?",
  "39524": "Or maybe it is that monsieur does not care to hunt marauders?",
  "39525": "To keep her in?",
  "39526": "And what do you?",
  "39527": "First, you are sorry for what you've done, and you see the folly of it all?",
  "39528": "Are they or their descendants to embrace our faith?",
  "39529": "Where is the church?",
  "39530": "Nor by reason of a knowledge which advises about brazen pots, I said, nor as possessing any other similar knowledge?",
  "39531": "Who shall judge of the continuance of the danger?",
  "39532": "Are you sure we are alone?",
  "39533": "Are you quite sure that this is a man, or that he has ever been one?",
  "39534": "Who said it?",
  "39535": "The queen wears the rosette?",
  "39536": "To give him an opportunity or making some of his severe remarks and moral reflections, and to undo what we had so much trouble in effecting?",
  "39537": "Pannus, pro quo supponit?",
  "39538": "Swann?",
  "39539": "But is there any doubt as to what he will do on the prominent questions if elected?",
  "39540": "Do you count that as nothing?",
  "39541": "Was it religion that prompted him to cannibalism?",
  "39542": "But do you say he will marry you?",
  "39543": "Their feet?",
  "39544": "Wha will bind up the brags of weir?",
  "39545": "Is he still here?",
  "39546": "The thing was proven upon him?",
  "39547": "Do you feel rather easier?",
  "39548": "Where are the matches?",
  "39549": "Then, for all your valour, you would save your life?",
  "39550": "Guilty of what?",
  "39551": "Why, is any day old and new?",
  "39552": "Nor would you say that medicine is the art of receiving pay because a man takes fees when he is engaged in healing?",
  "39553": "You have, at least, money to receive, as you have an order?",
  "39554": "How she does?",
  "39555": "What does he feel?",
  "39556": "Why are they turned out?",
  "39557": "Very decided character there, sir?",
  "39558": "Remain here?",
  "39559": "Where is he?",
  "39560": "How long have you been here?",
  "39561": "Can he hear my word?",
  "39562": "Where is it then?",
  "39563": "Which would you like best for me to make you, a little cake and bless you, or a big cake and curse you?",
  "39564": "His flatterers?",
  "39565": "Reward?",
  "39566": "How shall I bear it?",
  "39567": "Shall we go up and join my mother?",
  "39568": "What made you suppose we should be?",
  "39569": "In gold, silver, or notes?",
  "39570": "But the sympathies of the latter were with the mother?",
  "39571": "What money have we?",
  "39572": "The election came, and what was the result?",
  "39573": "There is no exit?",
  "39574": "You know what a file is?",
  "39575": "A very strange one?",
  "39576": "Did you know that I have a son?",
  "39577": "You are the cure, are you not?",
  "39578": "You see this foot?",
  "39579": "A rabbit?",
  "39580": "Direct?",
  "39581": "Where have you been so long?",
  "39582": "But is it possible that we are not all associated?",
  "39583": "Who can it be?",
  "39584": "Can you say the person who fought many a sanguinary battle, who got through many cunning negotiations with enemies and friends, who personally experienced the troubles of polygamy, was a person sinless and divine?",
  "39585": "Quite well?",
  "39586": "Which makes in my coffers?",
  "39587": "My dear boy, I hope you are not worn out?",
  "39588": "You do not think we would harm you?",
  "39589": "Hempseed?",
  "39590": "But you will go to heaven, mamma, and why should I not speak of it?",
  "39591": "How could a little chap like me hurt so many people?",
  "39592": "And who served under an assumed name?",
  "39593": "Have you another as good?",
  "39594": "Are you sleepy, darling?",
  "39595": "How was he dressed?",
  "39596": "Why ask this grace?",
  "39597": "But, my dear child, do you mean to say you could not love me if I had some other name?",
  "39598": "I will do well?",
  "39599": "Are you not going to wait until we bring the hostages?",
  "39600": "Sit down in your presence?",
  "39601": "I trouble YOU?",
  "39602": "You dismiss me, monsieur?",
  "39603": "Your father's not at home, I think, is he?",
  "39604": "And do you want to know where I found it?",
  "39605": "Do you mean the sorrel horse?",
  "39606": "Do you like me at all?",
  "39607": "Why these cries?",
  "39608": "Are you in a hurry, sir?",
  "39609": "What, now, pray?",
  "39610": "How is it possible for me to lose it at the moment your majesty's service calls for it?",
  "39611": "She was taken ill, you mean, and went home?",
  "39612": "Must one clatter like kettledrums and penitential preachers?",
  "39613": "I understand that the yew hedge is penetrated at one point by a gate?",
  "39614": "For what are words but words?",
  "39615": "How many of the wise and learned have married their cooks?",
  "39616": "Will she be able to go home today?",
  "39617": "But, my friend, is not that just the reason why you should trust in this matter to someone who can be more calm than yourself?",
  "39618": "Himself?",
  "39619": "If the fortifications of it are new or old?",
  "39620": "Do you eat gum leaves?",
  "39621": "Is not this your hope?",
  "39622": "You are not certain, of course?",
  "39623": "What did that poor, sweet girl do that you should want to cast such dishonour on her grave?",
  "39624": "Mine only joy, what can I more?",
  "39625": "Notice a telephone in the outer office?",
  "39626": "And what am I?",
  "39627": "How does that concern you?",
  "39628": "And why were they so terribly afraid of the dark?",
  "39629": "If you are a friend, why do you bite me so hard?",
  "39630": "But what security is there for the same qualities on the part of monarchy?",
  "39631": "And who has been drinking out of my little glass?",
  "39632": "Pip?",
  "39633": "None whatever?",
  "39634": "What is that to the purpose?",
  "39635": "What do you want to satisfy yourself about?",
  "39636": "And do you ask me that?",
  "39637": "Who all our seamen cheated of their debt?",
  "39638": "What's my return?",
  "39639": "How could it be, then, that I did not like her much the better of the two?",
  "39640": "But, gentlemen, whoever can pride himself on his diseases and even swagger over them?",
  "39641": "What force, what invincible instinct, what custom of centuries impels these birds to come back to this place?",
  "39642": "But may I be permitted solemnly to invoke my countrymen to pause and deliberate before they determine to destroy this the grandest temple which has ever been dedicated to human freedom since the world began?",
  "39643": "Well, what's going to happen now?",
  "39644": "What do YOU know about our faces?",
  "39645": "Then, you could dare censure for my sake?",
  "39646": "Had he perhaps chased butterflies too much?",
  "39647": "What, is't a prognostication raps him so?",
  "39648": "The arrangement of papers and documents?",
  "39649": "Well, doctor, suppose we were to go in pursuit of this cloud, since it refuses to burst upon us?",
  "39650": "How CAN I have done that?",
  "39651": "Were you hidden, or not?",
  "39652": "And does not the difference strike you?",
  "39653": "Dangerous?",
  "39654": "How are we this morning?",
  "39655": "And the nurse, of course?",
  "39656": "Is it blank cartridge or ball?",
  "39657": "You got it, then?",
  "39658": "Was there any hope of salvation for her either in this world or the next after such unnatural conduct?",
  "39659": "Pray, would you know the reason why I'm crying?",
  "39660": "Oh, how much for the jacket?",
  "39661": "What's amiss, dame?",
  "39662": "And who has not felt the same?",
  "39663": "What did your people say?",
  "39664": "Who knows not the double motion of the planets?",
  "39665": "Is my understanding sufficient for this or not?",
  "39666": "Was it still at all possible to be alive?",
  "39667": "Why should he be angry?",
  "39668": "Do you think she will find me much changed?",
  "39669": "What's that you've got, a dagger?",
  "39670": "Pray, with all your cleverness, why did not you manage to keep your eyes open?",
  "39671": "Have you got anything?",
  "39672": "You admit that you would fight, then?",
  "39673": "What says he?",
  "39674": "And what, after all, is the matter on hand?",
  "39675": "Or gold, ivory, purple, a lyre, a little knife, a flower, a shrub?",
  "39676": "What you know 'bout witches?",
  "39677": "Has he not come?",
  "39678": "How in the world can I know?",
  "39679": "What engagements?",
  "39680": "And how much do you want?",
  "39681": "What causes historical events?",
  "39682": "Degree of intelligence?",
  "39683": "Do they parade the cemetery as they parade the street?",
  "39684": "The mob's applauses, or the gifts of kings?",
  "39685": "You knew him, did you not?",
  "39686": "Why, how many tall ships, think ye, now, have I seen laid aboard?",
  "39687": "How long have you been here?",
  "39688": "Has it hurt you?",
  "39689": "What harm do they do?",
  "39690": "Friend or enemy?",
  "39691": "And will you really be an advocate for this unthankful, cruel man, who does not love you?",
  "39692": "Where is the count?",
  "39693": "If his mother were there in living burial, what could he do for her?",
  "39694": "But what are they to live upon?",
  "39695": "Grant that he desires the elective franchise, will he not attain it sooner by saving the already advanced steps towards it, than by running backward over them?",
  "39696": "And is he going to take you with him?",
  "39697": "What had he done?",
  "39698": "Well, and how is she?",
  "39699": "Should we let them go on or not?",
  "39700": "Over for the day?",
  "39701": "Is it a faith only for men, then?",
  "39702": "And why are you angry with your brother?",
  "39703": "Why is it art?",
  "39704": "Done?",
  "39705": "By whose permission?",
  "39706": "An cool?",

  "40493": "But who knows, madam, but somebody that shall be nameless would like me best with all my little finery about me?",
  "40494": "Why had he wasted his time hunting?",
  "40495": "In the hat?",
  "40496": "What is there in your mind?",
  "40497": "You really love, then, no lady at this court?",
  "40498": "Will she be safe over there?",
  "40499": "Have you a mind to teach the beavers to sing?",
  "40500": "Why was this?",
  "40501": "What have you got to say next?",
  "40502": "How soon can he be here?",
  "40503": "Now, what DO you want to buy?",
  "40504": "How you come to fall out?",
  "40505": "Will he come again?",
  "40506": "Where have you put it?",
  "40507": "Can you provide that they shall be separated at bed and board?",
  "40508": "Did anything happen this time?",
  "40509": "Where does my father get all that iron rust from?",
  "40510": "And you choose that time for grazing?",
  "40511": "Fifteen shillings a week not much, young man?",
  "40512": "If I could do that, simpleton, where would the danger be?",
  "40513": "A natural death is better than an artificial life, surely?",
  "40514": "Children dear, were we long alone?",
  "40515": "Is this number seven?",
  "40516": "Why do you suppose that I should look severely on your affection for that young man?",
  "40517": "Is this a weather to send benevolence?",
  "40518": "Who was the criminal, then?",
  "40519": "And what reason is that?",
  "40520": "Where was the difficulty?",
  "40521": "What do I care about blood?",
  "40522": "What is that stupid fellow troubling himself about?",
  "40523": "Is this a preparation for immortality?",
  "40524": "Had I ever seen so much loathing and pale horror on one countenance?",
  "40525": "When shall we start?",
  "40526": "Did I, sir?",
  "40527": "And who can tell when these happy hours may return?",
  "40528": "We were saying that the parents should be in the prime of life?",
  "40529": "Are these no capital?",
  "40530": "A little of the wine?",
  "40531": "Why did I at once experience a shock?",
  "40532": "Cannot I cut off the part and restore you by a sweat bath?",
  "40533": "Should art be taken seriously?",
  "40534": "But how are you to get that balance?",
  "40535": "Why this hostility of interests?",
  "40536": "What availed the noise and bustle of cheerful morning, which penetrated even there, to him?",
  "40537": "Have we not tramps and beggars enough already to pester us as we sit at meat?",
  "40538": "When shall it be?",
  "40539": "Can you turn a strain to the ladies, sir?",
  "40540": "Over whom?",
  "40541": "Would not jets of boiling water, constantly injected by the pumps, raise the temperature in this part and stay the congelation?",
  "40542": "What difference would that make?",
  "40543": "Or look you I should play the orator?",
  "40544": "Doth not wealth satiate, and become nauseous, and no longer serve to satisfy or pleasure, or to buy an hour's peace of mind?",
  "40545": "And did you do anything?",
  "40546": "You were going to say, thirdly?",
  "40547": "Do they really, you dog?",
  "40548": "Into a new light?",
  "40549": "Did she want to stay at home?",
  "40550": "Which building?",
  "40551": "But why should I consort, I, a brave man, with the abominable?",
  "40552": "Can you guess, now, what this is?",
  "40553": "Suppose you were a foundling and were shown our faith and yours, and asked for which you would decide, which would you choose?",
  "40554": "And how on earth would she ever manage to hold her tongue during school hours?",
  "40555": "Are we afraid of foreign gold?",
  "40556": "Was it a double tooth, hey?",
  "40557": "And how can it all be done by daybreak?",
  "40558": "After these, what resentment can remain in the heart?",
  "40559": "But if she has so absolutely failed, what then had she done?",
  "40560": "And you remember, too, the period when he began to grow fatter?",
  "40561": "What is nature?",
  "40562": "What was it that was borne in upon my mind when she stood still and looked attentively at me?",
  "40563": "And you're not frightened?",
  "40564": "Are you a politician, friend?",
  "40565": "Have you not got all the plants and stones you want?",
  "40566": "What time was it?",
  "40567": "Is it obeying your husband to disobey him on the wital subject of his business?",
  "40568": "On what grounds?",
  "40569": "What is your address in the country?",
  "40570": "How will he ever know the truth, since I shall not tell him of it?",
  "40571": "It was he who rescued you?",
  "40572": "What, for instance, do you mean by all that humbug about the soul?",
  "40573": "Cannot I answer your purpose?",
  "40574": "To whom did he give up his sword?",
  "40575": "Would not that be a sacrifice of higher prospects for you?",
  "40576": "Say, what can cause such impotence of mind?",
  "40577": "But the doctor?",
  "40578": "What business have I with this pipe?",
  "40579": "You have a recipe for it?",
  "40580": "But she?",
  "40581": "Do you know anything about fortifications?",
  "40582": "Is there no merit in repentance?",
  "40583": "What became of you, dear?",
  "40584": "Well, what is to be done, mademoiselle, when so many wills are leagued against me?",
  "40585": "And besides, what is truth to us but the continuous progress of our mind from poetry to prose?",
  "40586": "Is there any point to which you would wish to draw my attention?",
  "40587": "Shall we go in?",
  "40588": "And how would I do it, think you?",
  "40589": "At least we can have a window?",
  "40590": "It was somewhere here?",
  "40591": "Must one die like a dog?",
  "40592": "What does that wagon contain?",
  "40593": "What's the matter with your leg?",
  "40594": "Might not some curious eye fasten on it, and divine its contents?",
  "40595": "What is the difference?",
  "40596": "Who's the other fool?",
  "40597": "Well, do you understand, monsieur?",
  "40598": "You are doing catkins?",
  "40599": "Now, how does a man search a revolving bookcase?",
  "40600": "On what ground do you venture to interfere with me, messieurs?",
  "40601": "What ails ye, man?",
  "40602": "What would be your surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness?",
  "40603": "If you're not coming yourself, give us the cards, will you?",
  "40604": "In the office?",
  "40605": "Ah, precious one, why does your lover live to see you dead?",
  "40606": "Could she be deceived as to the meaning of this?",
  "40607": "Do you really mean to say that that leg of yours is better already?",
  "40608": "Do you not think perhaps that some of the shortcoming lies with yourself?",
  "40609": "Her name?",
  "40610": "How can that be, monsieur?",
  "40611": "What duties?",
  "40612": "And suppose he can obtain his desires, is that so bad as cutting her throat?",
  "40613": "Look here, do you intend to take up you abode with us?",
  "40614": "What do you want to drink now?",
  "40615": "Carey?",
  "40616": "Happy?",
  "40617": "How old are you?",
  "40618": "Is it such as they that we are to follow?",
  "40619": "Do you not think that I also long for forgetfulness?",
  "40620": "What's this?",
  "40621": "What is the captain about?",
  "40622": "Cannot you tell him I will?",
  "40623": "Why had he not let them know that he was still working on the case?",
  "40624": "A ghost?",
  "40625": "Will you work?",
  "40626": "Where have you been, this long, long while?",
  "40627": "What might not have happened to men?",
  "40628": "With what color of propriety could the force necessary for defense be limited by those who cannot limit the force of offense?",
  "40629": "Is it bright?",
  "40630": "How could I know he hated him?",
  "40631": "And all this, for what, I pray?",
  "40632": "Who told you that I loved him?",
  "40633": "Is that what you meant?",
  "40634": "And did I do it for my country's sake?",
  "40635": "Why did you get married?",
  "40636": "But what exactly am I to tell you about them?",
  "40637": "Now where will it be agreeable to you that we hold our conference?",
  "40638": "Why does fate play such tricks with poor, helpless worms?",
  "40639": "Have you ever seen a snake rise up on your path?",
  "40640": "Do passive indolent women make the best wives?",
  "40641": "What would you feel, if a man were faithless to you?",
  "40642": "Has a dog money?",
  "40643": "What do you want there?",
  "40644": "Eliza, girl, what ails you today?",
  "40645": "What is there for me to eat this evening?",
  "40646": "Is there fate amongst us still, send down from the pagan world of old, that such things must be, and in such way?",
  "40647": "Then you had some grounds for supposing he might be the culprit?",
  "40648": "How on earth did you manage to become the favorite of the king, you who have never spoken to him more than twice in your life?",
  "40649": "And your second wish?",
  "40650": "If the view from below had been most interesting and singular, how shall I describe its appearance as seen from above?",
  "40651": "What do you think of a brilliant display of fireworks?",
  "40652": "Are you cold?",
  "40653": "Not so dusty, what?",
  "40654": "Till death itself?",
  "40655": "To defend him would be to accuse herself, would it not?",
  "40656": "But do you think it will rise?",
  "40657": "As bad as all that?",
  "40658": "May it not be spoken except in private?",
  "40659": "For the story?",
  "40660": "But not as a CELEBRITY?",
  "40661": "Is it possible that you do not know that comparisons of wit with wit, valour with valour, beauty with beauty, birth with birth, are always odious and unwelcome?",
  "40662": "When did you first begin this mad career?",
  "40663": "May he share your hopes?",
  "40664": "Would she so?",
  "40665": "Do you place it out at interest?",
  "40666": "I suppose that's why you never got married, uncle?",
  "40667": "But do you know why he did not come, papa?",
  "40668": "Then he is on board?",
  "40669": "Do you find the study of the lower orders interesting?",
  "40670": "Can you make any objection?",
  "40671": "It is quite decided, then?",
  "40672": "What shall I pay you for the body?",
  "40673": "Would he not rather say or do the same as his like in the same case?",
  "40674": "Stryver?",
  "40675": "But how do you and your neighbour get on about the disputed right of way?",
  "40676": "It is possible we may meet again,' and 'will it be of any consequence to you whether we do or not?",
  "40677": "Would he have to abdicate his precentorship, as he had his wardenship, and to give up chanting, as he had given up his twelve old bedesmen?",
  "40678": "What is he waiting for?",
  "40679": "Do you remember that's what you used to call them?",
  "40680": "And where is coldness so ugly as between brothers?",
  "40681": "You know you let me call you so?",
  "40682": "Where is he, then?",
  "40683": "Does the cardinal refuse to receive the king?",
  "40684": "Theurgy, magic, and sorcery?",
  "40685": "What can have happened to them all this time?",
  "40686": "What did you talk about?",
  "40687": "Why on earth do you say that?",
  "40688": "Do you know why it's called a whiting?",
  "40689": "Eyebrows?",
  "40690": "Could I forget them?",
  "40691": "Number and date taken, I suppose?",
  "40692": "Have I not borne secrets heavier than this?",
  "40693": "But, then, accidents?",
  "40694": "Do you think it would be any harm?",
  "40695": "Why not add to the first class the pachydermatous indifference to rebuffs which is of such service to the social climber, and, to the second, taste in dress and the habit of not repeating stories?",
  "40696": "Conrad, what is it?",
  "40697": "Is there nobody here who can sing a song to lighten the time?",
  "40698": "Bless me, how shall I behave?",
  "40699": "What harm can I do to you or to her?",
  "40700": "On me, uncle?",
  "40701": "Somebody has stolen a rabbit?",
  "40702": "Why enter into painful details, so easily divined by the intelligent reader?",
  "40703": "How do you come here?",
  "40704": "Does any answer come out of it?",
  "40705": "How can he find out his strength or weakness otherwise?",
  "40706": "Who's talking o' women?",
  "40707": "Have you never made others labor?",
  "40708": "Ist I will be reueng'd?",
  "40709": "Does he give you sharp answers?",
  "40710": "Do we want to contemplate his mercy?",
  "40711": "What is your theory, then, as to those footmarks?",
  "40712": "And how did you find out?",
  "40713": "Are your things sent off?",
  "40714": "Why did they fancy you?",
  "40715": "Will that suit you?",
  "40716": "Feel what, squire?",
  "40717": "So, then, am I her enemy?",
  "40718": "Saturday?",
  "40719": "How do you keep it on?",
  "40720": "Well, what if there is a trial?",
  "40721": "What are you yourself seeking?",
  "40722": "Would I be quiet and talk rationally?",
  "40723": "Well, what can you do?",
  "40724": "But what would grammar matter if he really loved her?",
  "40725": "Has he marked himself?",
  "40726": "I ask by whose authority?",
  "40727": "Why need he bother about my tuft?",
  "40728": "Farfrae's?",
  "40729": "Are you turning up your noses?",
  "40730": "What then remained?",
  "40731": "You're getting too proud to own me afore company, are you?",
  "40732": "Your father was fortunate, then?",
  "40733": "Do you really believe that such is our aim?",
  "40734": "Could he, as he asked, stop the sea with his hands?",
  "40735": "What has she done?",
  "40736": "I've fretted my gizzard green about it, maister, but what can I do?",
  "40737": "Could it be possible that even now a remnant of that lost race inhabited the ruined grandeur that had once been their progenitor?",
  "40738": "Quite for ever?",
  "40739": "Why do you keep tramping up and down like an old hen?",
  "40740": "Is it ketching?",
  "40741": "Your opinion, if you please, on this difficult matter?",
  "40742": "As her husband was a man of means, and had doubtless returned by this time, could she not send them the money?",
  "40743": "And dark?",
  "40744": "What name would your friend like to put on it?",
  "40745": "What are you going to tell me?",
  "40746": "And if you wished to die, you would choose this death, count?",
  "40747": "What are you doing out of your studio at this hour?",
  "40748": "Is love the only thing?",
  "40749": "For that only?",
  "40750": "And I hope you're good children, are you?",
  "40751": "How was it that no one else saw it?",
  "40752": "In our own house?",
  "40753": "Cannot you inform him that it is frightful earnest?",
  "40754": "Well, what shall we do?",
  "40755": "Well, then, are you the brave captain, are you the valiant blade who dispersed those who wished to burn the condemned?",
  "40756": "Will you please look into the case and restore the old man to his home if the public interest will admit?",
  "40757": "Why should we not imagine this the apartment of an honest mother?",
  "40758": "No bid?",
  "40759": "He comes to live with us?",
  "40760": "Have they come from the town?",
  "40761": "But who told you I was inactive?",
  "40762": "Can you remember any breakfast that I've had today?",
  "40763": "And what are they, captain?",
  "40764": "Well, what of it?",
  "40765": "What am I to do?",
  "40766": "Why did you leave there?",
  "40767": "What can you suppose?",
  "40768": "What drawer or tiring do you mean?",
  "40769": "Did he say whether he had any business to speak about?",
  "40770": "Are you 'fraid of bubbles, too?",
  "40771": "I hope you have preserved the unities, sir?",
  "40772": "Martha knew about you all the time?",
  "40773": "Why did you paint him?",
  "40774": "Come, who is this man who is in the basket?",
  "40775": "Because I like his company?",
  "40776": "How many desperate wretches have I sent to the devil?",
  "40777": "You've got them at last?",
  "40778": "Then why so hurry me?",
  "40779": "Why do you grovel before it?",
  "40780": "Is it all a quite dead garden?",
  "40781": "Now, do you know what all this means?",
  "40782": "Can nothing save him?",
  "40783": "You know his guilt?",
  "40784": "What was that miracle?",
  "40785": "And what may you have to say to him?",
  "40786": "Oh, madam, let me bring you a little something?",
  "40787": "Well, now, what are your conditions, if I employ you?",
  "40788": "You have as good as informed me, sir, that you are going shortly to be married?",
  "40789": "Oh, where is there deliverance from the flux of things and from the 'existence' of penalty?",
  "40790": "Do you think he wants to die?",
  "40791": "The only question was, had she ten or twelve?",
  "40792": "What faces are the most distinct to me in the fleeting crowd?",
  "40793": "What should you prefer?",
  "40794": "Why not, if it amuses him?",
  "40795": "And pray, where do you consider modern music to begin?",
  "40796": "Why do we hate?",
  "40797": "And if she cast it aside, her loyalty, her promise?",
  "40798": "A prisoner?",
  "40799": "But, even relying on his good faith, would be he able to keep his promise?",
  "40800": "Haow soon?",
  "40801": "But what can I do?",
  "40802": "You cannot say what it was?",
  "40803": "And the walks in the avenues?",
  "40804": "Who shall reveal the burning anxiety with which he throbbed to see beyond that cruel wall?",
  "40805": "What will he do?",
  "40806": "To whom shall I give the list of the children's linen?",
  "40807": "What have you said, but that I am to stay a fortnight longer?",
  "40808": "What do you think of a bite of a mouth like that?",
  "40809": "Shall I rise, madam, and pay my duty to my new aunt?",
  "40810": "Emp'ror?",
  "40811": "What other course could it pursue?",
  "40812": "Where's my ulster?",
  "40813": "What to do next?",
  "40814": "Dreadful apparition, why do you trouble me?",
  "40815": "Is she also taken away from me for ever?",
  "40816": "Would not the general loss be too great to justify such relief?",
  "40817": "How many did you get?",
  "40818": "But you like me in spite of it?",
  "40819": "Have you come from a great distance?",
  "40820": "What right have we to argue?",
  "40821": "Have you ever been there?",
  "40822": "With the king's command?",
  "40823": "And is she possessed with a devil?",
  "40824": "Upon what is opinion settled?",
  "40825": "Was it an accident?",
  "40826": "What is the good of all this romancing?",
  "40827": "Why on earth not?",
  "40828": "Montmartre?",
  "40829": "What occasions?",
  "40830": "Know not the living that the grave will swallow them up after a life of sadness and cruel misery?",
  "40831": "So, with the springtime, what was more likely than that the wild idea of escaping had come to him?",
  "40832": "He stopped hard by me, and asked if I knew who he was?",
  "40833": "What could be inside it?",
  "40834": "She is your daughter?",
  "40835": "Where could it a come from?",
  "40836": "A murderous attack?",
  "40837": "Has this place any local appellation?",
  "40838": "Shall I strike it, sir?",
  "40839": "Why do you talk to me like this?",
  "40840": "What can he do here?",
  "40841": "You're not racing?",
  "40842": "Shall it lie unproductive in the public vaults?",
  "40843": "What are you looking at now?",
  "40844": "Why went he there?",
  "40845": "Oh, is that all?",
  "40846": "Or is this not true, is there no such thing as pure accident?",
  "40847": "Alas, who shall now comfort the good margrave's wife?",
  "40848": "That book is quite closed?",
  "40849": "What do you expect me to say?",
  "40850": "Am I?",
  "40851": "Are you happy?",
  "40852": "Why all this coldness, O my best beloved?",
  "40853": "Well, but where have you left the ladies?",
  "40854": "Have you come to meet me?",
  "40855": "And suppose that they were to attack the upper part of the balloon, what would you do?",
  "40856": "May I beg your pardon again, if I inquire what you mean, sir?",
  "40857": "Leave?",
  "40858": "Ever, as long as you live?",
  "40859": "Was ever such an account of a dynasty given?",
  "40860": "Is the cloth taken?",
  "40861": "Adam?",
  "40862": "How did you receive that wound on your face?",
  "40863": "But what did you do yesterday after you left me?",
  "40864": "And the harmonious soul is both temperate and courageous?",
  "40865": "Now, how should I, that ne'er have squealed in your sty, know all the swine therein?",
  "40866": "And what do you suppose it's made of?",
  "40867": "I wonder what's become of her?",
  "40868": "Would you have your husband constantly at your feet?",
  "40869": "Where shall you be yourself?",
  "40870": "Are not the young people growing up today, really dead before they have a chance to live?",
  "40871": "How many times have I told you to tell me at once?",
  "40872": "Is not that so?",
  "40873": "Is it more afflicting to him to leave the graves of his fathers than it is to our brothers and children?",
  "40874": "Do you think it is nonsense?",
  "40875": "And what of passion, or spirit?",
  "40876": "And will you punish him because he cannot become so?",
  "40877": "To you alone, then, may I confide my sorrows and my hopes?",
  "40878": "Now, what do you complain of?",
  "40879": "Shall I be believed?",
  "40880": "Well, and what good would that be?",
  "40881": "How do you propose to deal with the case, sir?",
  "40882": "AIN' dat gay?",
  "40883": "It was you, then, that hit me?",
  "40884": "Who is this?",

  "41057": "Did he read my letter?",
  "41058": "Do I not know that that is infinite space, and that it is not a round arch?",
  "41059": "And where would they get the money to rescue us if we was to let on we're no worse than other people?",
  "41060": "What will we do, if we get thirsty?",
  "41061": "And win what race?",
  "41062": "Would you ride with me a little way tomorrow morning?",
  "41063": "Tell me, my dear host, if you do not remember this gentleman?",
  "41064": "Should we not feel we had done you wrong, and taken advantage of you?",
  "41065": "Wherefore this desolation of spirit, this anguish of heart?",
  "41066": "And then, no wages, do you hear, my boy?",
  "41067": "But how live in that city?",
  "41068": "Could you?",
  "41069": "How did he get ahead of us?",

  "41077": "The gift of a friend?",
  "41078": "What would the subjects of the extracts I should have had to make from books, or even the books themselves, have signified to me?",
  "41079": "Can any reasons be given for the prevalence of any one or all of the methods?",
  "41080": "But do you think as they've done her in, sir?",

  "41082": "If the lady is hurt as bad as you say, who was it that wrote this note?",
  "41083": "Does your mother wash?",
  "41084": "What would you have done if you had had to go into the army, to go and fight beneath the standard?",
  "41085": "Tom, do you believe the man I gave the money to, is really implicated in this crime?",
  "41086": "And whom have you for an advocate?",
  "41087": "Where are you?",
  "41088": "Do innocent men inveigle nameless vagabonds, and prowl with them about the country as idle robbers do?",

  "41113": "Is there not time enough for that?",
  "41114": "You'll have some meat?",
  "41115": "Well, what's the matter?",
  "41116": "Why should they ask us?",
  "41117": "Is it not a greater wonder that they should be kept up anywhere?",
  "41118": "Why did the old folly end now, and no later?",
  "41119": "Have I been asleep?",

  "41129": "Gisors?",
  "41130": "Why this precautionary view, she asked herself afresh, when her father had complained, at the very least, as little as herself?",
  "41131": "Why, what ails you?",
  "41132": "Do you care for me?",
  "41133": "Where to get the money?",

  "41498": "And what will that good treatment be?",
  "41499": "Well, but is there any war on record which was carried on successfully by him, or aided by his counsels, when he was alive?",
  "41500": "Do you want a map?",
  "41501": "But what other is there?",
  "41502": "You understand the rest, then?",

  "41509": "Have you seen for YOUR self?",
  "41510": "Bore me, my dear?",
  "41511": "How can I ever pay you?",

  "41580": "What are people planning against him?",
  "41581": "Forever a footman?",

  "41583": "Who forced my hand, as was the lawful cap'n?",
  "41584": "Will your majesty do me the honor to explain yourself?",
  "41585": "Who could this young woman be, I wonder?",
  "41586": "The beginning of what?",
  "41587": "Why does the theatre draw me so that I am willing to sacrifice for it even those I love?",
  "41588": "Can you remember?",
  "41589": "What should ail them?",
  "41590": "But why should these rough drafts of letters be regarded as anything else than what they actually and obviously are?",
  "41591": "Why had he married the eyes in the photograph?",
  "41592": "Ned, my dear fellow, will you mention what we agreed upon?",
  "41593": "Do you know what that is?",
  "41594": "Was he satisfied?",
  "41595": "Have you been for a soldier?",

  "42811": "Is there any one closer to me nor you, or is it likely I'd be listening to stories brought against you?",
  "42812": "And can you not see, sir, the truth that's in me?",
  "42813": "Well, young fellow, are you glad to come to school?",

  "43260": "Eh, what food?",
  "43261": "Do you wish to speak to me?",
  "43262": "Who had been tried as he had been tried, and had gone through such fire with less loss of intellectual power than he had done?",
  "43263": "Where else should it reside but in those who are to pay the expense?",
  "43264": "Your men will know, then, what they have to do?",

  "43266": "But when be any of you going home?",
  "43267": "Any trade doing here?",
  "43268": "Is it for them that we shed our blood, and exhaust the treasures of our people?",
  "43269": "Why should he frighten them away?",
  "43270": "Is this the soldier?",

  "43276": "Do you know anything about it?",
  "43277": "Were you serious?",
  "43278": "Can it be possible?",
  "43279": "Will you let me openly ask you a plain question?",
  "43280": "But, on the other hand, is not their hate equally manifest?",
  "43281": "Can one talk of love in these days?",
  "43282": "Will it not rob the tribe of a great fighter?",
  "43283": "How can I think of the bright side of life when, as you see, I am sitting on a barrel and working in a dirty shed?",
  "43284": "Will you let me try?",
  "43285": "You come and bid me adieu, and are going nowhere?",
  "43286": "Surely I may come and walk in it sometimes?",
  "43287": "But what did you want the carpenter for?",
  "43288": "Where do you live?",
  "43289": "Who did they know that would take it?",
  "43290": "Who is firing?",
  "43291": "That is it, is it not, monseigneur, and I shall have nothing else to do?",
  "43292": "What more, therefore, can we ask to distinguish the sentiments, dependent on humanity, from those connected with any other passion, or to satisfy us, why the former are the origin of morals, not the latter?",
  "43293": "Or has the last novel been too moving?",

  "43312": "Do not its own inhabitants say it is a market where every man has his price, and where corruption is common traffic at the expense of a deluded people?",
  "43313": "Will it annoy you if she is left behind?",
  "43314": "What possible reason can there be for him to be in debt?",
  "43315": "Was he not beloved, held dear, well seen of all men?",
  "43316": "And hard up, I suppose?",
  "43317": "But do you see, he rejoined, how many we are?",

  "43326": "What then, captain?",
  "43327": "Then no intemperance or madness should be allowed to approach true love?",
  "43328": "Was it a signal?",
  "43329": "Will you allow me to plead my cause like an advocate, or rather like a poor woman?",
  "43330": "And you think that to save such villains as you I will become an abettor of their plot, an accomplice in their crimes?",
  "43331": "The critics been hammering your stock down?",
  "43332": "What then could be the use of this ecclesiastical inquiry exactly at the same time?",
  "43333": "Who wrote for particulars concerning my father?",
  "43334": "But if I am to help you catch him, what is your plan?",
  "43335": "Or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?",

  "43350": "Was it hate?",
  "43351": "Do these changes mean that we should alter our traditional approach to the doctrine for and design of forces?",
  "43352": "Where, there?",
  "43353": "What mean you by that?",
  "43354": "When I am better, do you mind?",
  "43355": "Madame?",
  "43356": "Is that holy awe filling you?",
  "43357": "All that would arise out of his ignorance of the true upper and middle and lower regions?",
  "43358": "Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?",
  "43359": "Why then do you speak of original occupancy?",
  "43360": "But is she safe?",
  "43361": "But does not the superiority in force afford also the best means of spreading out and finding more room, and therefore more means of subsistence and shelter?",
  "43362": "You have nothing to complain of, I hope?",
  "43363": "And I was thinking, who's that?",
  "43364": "Where am I, and why am I here?",
  "43365": "Who carrieth his ashes unto the mountain?",
  "43366": "The only question is, has it been destroyed or not?",
  "43367": "May I go and ask them, that I may have the opportunity of making my peace with you?",
  "43368": "Where shall I put her?",
  "43369": "But, you understand that that was not the child I am speaking of?",
  "43370": "Well, said he, but did you wait upon her?",
  "43371": "A sledge, sir?",
  "43372": "Why does a purely NUMERICAL or GEOMETRICAL difference in the composition and form of atoms give rise to PHYSIOLOGICAL properties so different?",
  "43373": "For whom?",
  "43374": "Because of heart failure?",
  "43375": "What, the one nearest to the path?",
  "43376": "What do the caballeros?",
  "43377": "In what, then?",
  "43378": "Then you condemn me to live wretched and to die accursed?",

  "43380": "What does he look like, my dear?",
  "43381": "When I wished to retire into a convent, you remember how angry you were with me?",
  "43382": "My I speak frankly to you?",
  "43383": "Succeeds it, or no?",
  "43384": "It may well be asked how is it possible to reconcile this case with the theory of natural selection?",
  "43385": "How do you know, then?",
  "43386": "Is it not a horrible caprice?",
  "43387": "Careful of what, may I ask?",
  "43388": "How can I?",
  "43389": "Where were to be lodged all the gentry of the neighborhood, who would gather in two or three hours after the news had enlarged the circle of its report, like the increasing circumference produced by a stone thrown into a placid lake?",
  "43390": "What do you think of him?",
  "43391": "Pomotou?",
  "43392": "Does it please the venerable one to listen to me for one moment longer?",
  "43393": "Now, how many tickets will you take?",
  "43394": "Hwarof kalenges tu me?",
  "43395": "Have you nothing more to say?",
  "43396": "And if there is no change in the situation, will not the future always be a deplorable copy of the past?",
  "43397": "Why repeat their visit?",
  "43398": "Is there anything at all behind that impassive face?",
  "43399": "How, again, would he take the news of his son's good fortune?",
  "43400": "Do you mean that your wife and you wish to leave?",
  "43401": "Have we followed that road?",
  "43402": "What makes you look so flurried?",
  "43403": "If they have perceived it, why have they neglected to condemn it?",
  "43404": "But does such an event lie sufficiently within the bounds of probability to justify the belief in its occurrence on the strength of any attainable, or, indeed, imaginable, evidence?",
  "43405": "Feel yourself guilty?",
  "43406": "Have you no remembrance of the occasion?",
  "43407": "Have I not told you so, gentlemen?",
  "43408": "Will there really be a trousseau and all that?",
  "43409": "What, lady, is the cause of your alarm?",
  "43410": "Whom are you going to marry?",
  "43411": "Is that all, monseigneur?",
  "43412": "Do you guess that I have come to remind you of a promise?",
  "43413": "What do you mean by all three?",
  "43414": "Stolen?",
  "43415": "Did I not always say so, archdeacon?",
  "43416": "Vot is cum'd to mein pipe?",
  "43417": "Can you imagine a crab as large as yonder table, with its many legs moving slowly and uncertainly, its big claws swaying, its long antennae, like carters' whips, waving and feeling, and its stalked eyes gleaming at you on either side of its metallic front?",
  "43418": "Do you not suspect this young man of having given bad counsel?",
  "43419": "Any one with you?",
  "43420": "What could he talk about?",
  "43421": "Which years do you mean to include?",
  "43422": "How can it fail to draw the father and mother nearer?",
  "43423": "Would it not be well to hear what I have to say?",
  "43424": "Why should they look for me?",
  "43425": "When did she die?",
  "43426": "And who thinks of using him ill?",
  "43427": "Why in the world not?",
  "43428": "Has he asked for me?",
  "43429": "Then may I go and tell him, sir?",
  "43430": "Why pine not I, and die in this distress?",
  "43431": "Shall I take you in my arms?",
  "43432": "Mussels too?",
  "43433": "How does it feel?",
  "43434": "Hudson?",
  "43435": "Are you stopping at your old quarters?",
  "43436": "But what is all this?",
  "43437": "Tom, have you got on the track of that money again?",
  "43438": "Of what was he guilty?",
  "43439": "Am I still bound to her?",
  "43440": "You have not an umbrella that I can use as a stick?",
  "43441": "You were asking, then?",
  "43442": "Is this the time to sing?",
  "43443": "And who will do it for me?",
  "43444": "Is it to the judge or to the husband?",
  "43445": "Staunton?",
  "43446": "Saw it?",
  "43447": "How have I flown to the height where no rabble any longer sit at the wells?",
  "43448": "Why do you do that?",
  "43449": "Burned?",
  "43450": "Has the host told you nothing, then?",
  "43451": "How could I have mistook you?",
  "43452": "Does she, indeed?",
  "43453": "What are his means of existence?",
  "43454": "And she will hold her tongue?",
  "43455": "Would not the first of them who saw me wring my neck like a snipe's?",
  "43456": "How should I know?",
  "43457": "Was it her hairdresser who had escaped from a bear, or was it a bear who had escaped from her hairdresser's?",
  "43458": "What house?",
  "43459": "It is, eh?",
  "43460": "And then, when she heard how true he was, how he persisted against father, mother, and sisters, how could it be that that should not be a merit in her eyes which was so great a fault in theirs?",
  "43461": "Do you think we'd have let them know about it?",
  "43462": "And now, is it all over between us?",
  "43463": "And it was very natural that she should, for having so few sentiments in common, when the sexual tie was broken, what was to hold her?",
  "43464": "Have you no husband?",
  "43465": "O my dear friend, how can I enumerate the benefits that I have received from your goodness?",
  "43466": "And are enemies also to receive what we owe to them?",
  "43467": "When he is by himself he will not mind saying or doing many things which he would be ashamed of any one hearing or seeing him do?",
  "43468": "Is the nurse here?",
  "43469": "Was he not employing all his legal prerogatives, and many prerogatives which were not legal, for the purpose of forcing his subjects to conform to his creed?",
  "43470": "How was that made?",
  "43471": "Silly question?",
  "43472": "Congratulate him on what?",
  "43473": "Then where the devil is the woman?",
  "43474": "Of what use would such sacrifice be?",
  "43475": "What is the matter with you, my angel?",
  "43476": "Who told you of him?",
  "43477": "What, under such circumstances, could have been expected even from a man gifted with great talents?",
  "43478": "I was willin' a long time, sir?",
  "43479": "And can we deliver our friend?",
  "43480": "Could there be finer symptoms?",
  "43481": "Will you let us in?",
  "43482": "I suppose he is right in what he tells us now?",
  "43483": "What is the meaning of all this?",
  "43484": "But how can one help it, monsieur, when one has worked all one's life?",
  "43485": "What do you call her, doctor?",
  "43486": "Who does he mean?",
  "43487": "Could you swear to it?",
  "43488": "What, do you confess, then?",
  "43489": "Is that bill real?",
  "43490": "Then where is the butter jar?",
  "43491": "Do you believe me?",
  "43492": "My question is only whether the just man, while refusing to have more than another just man, would wish and claim to have more than the unjust?",
  "43493": "What can I do to save you?",
  "43494": "And what if they are?",
  "43495": "Has he recognized me?",
  "43496": "Do you hear what he says?",
  "43497": "You want to go to your uncle?",
  "43498": "Do you begin, a little, to be satisfied?",
  "43499": "What's come to your lead?",
  "43500": "Am I that?",
  "43501": "Well, my dear fellow, so you still want to be an adjutant?",
  "43502": "Maybe you could get something in the stage line?",
  "43503": "How much is the bottle?",
  "43504": "Who are those people?",
  "43505": "Come, who is my father?",
  "43506": "Why this interest?",
  "43507": "And what answer did you get?",
  "43508": "Will you kindly gif me a word of taste and help?",
  "43509": "Will you do that?",
  "43510": "Is it so?",
  "43511": "You remember the hat beside the dead man?",
  "43512": "What shall we do now, my son?",
  "43513": "You are referring to the demands of the rebels and to the tone in which they stated them?",
  "43514": "Now, really, let me ask, sir, have you?",
  "43515": "But, in admitting that the sun does not go out, might it not happen that the earth might move away from it?",
  "43516": "Do you mean where have I been while supper was getting ready?",
  "43517": "So, you will go?",
  "43518": "What's that writing about, eh?",
  "43519": "What chance brings you here, gentlemen?",
  "43520": "And, when so weighed, were they ever to kick the beam like feathers?",
  "43521": "What would he with vs?",
  "43522": "Would they soon be coming?",
  "43523": "Will you allow no affection, no love on my side, where there has been so much on your side?",
  "43524": "You, you poor creature, what good would you do?",
  "43525": "How will he live?",
  "43526": "Have you weaned her yet?",
  "43527": "Is there still no end to the bloodshed?",
  "43528": "Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up to the grand northern lights?",
  "43529": "Do you believe there is a consideration in the world that would induce her to take such a step against her favourite son?",
  "43530": "What is he looking at?",
  "43531": "But was not her father the head of the community?",
  "43532": "How could you be so careless?",
  "43533": "What are we to do?",
  "43534": "How is your life in danger here?",
  "43535": "Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?",
  "43536": "Again, upon the supposition that the soul is a harmony, why is one soul better than another?",
  "43537": "How did I deserve such pay?",
  "43538": "Where did he get out?",
  "43539": "Never mind, you know when monsieur le comte will return, at least?",
  "43540": "What was passing in that receptive childlike soul that so eagerly caught and assimilated all the diverse impressions of life?",
  "43541": "Which is which?",
  "43542": "I have been betrayed or denounced, then?",
  "43543": "Andy, where's your gun?",
  "43544": "So much as that?",
  "43545": "And have whole streams of blood been spilt in vain?",
  "43546": "But what is there to say about me?",
  "43547": "How were we going to begin to bring order out of this chaos?",
  "43548": "Do you recognize the carriage?",
  "43549": "Why was she stumbling about amongst the rubble and catching her dress in brambles and burrs?",
  "43550": "Which driver was going to drive the carriage and which the cart?",
  "43551": "Who has clothed the earth in its beauty?",
  "43552": "Who a cuss cares what he knows?",
  "43553": "Zakhar is shouting that I should turn to the left, but why to the left?",
  "43554": "You believe in nothing visible, except grass and birds?",
  "43555": "But that column of water?",
  "43556": "How did you know it was the country?",
  "43557": "Were you comfortable together?",
  "43558": "May I stay a little longer?",
  "43559": "Will you become a suitor to her for her hand?",
  "43560": "What, to marry in an inn, and at night too?",
  "43561": "Well, where are we to go to now, father?",
  "43562": "Would you do me the favor of stepping into the shop?",
  "43563": "You see the stairs afore you?",
  "43564": "What will your relatives say to see me in a crumpled collar?",
  "43565": "To READ?",
  "43566": "The empty one?",
  "43567": "Where shall we meet again?",
  "43568": "Anyways, your reverence will call for me coming back?",
  "43569": "The earth?",
  "43570": "What unforseen events might not open his prison door, and restore him to liberty?",
  "43571": "Why will you have nothing to do with me?",
  "43572": "Was it prudence?",
  "43573": "Can we imagine it possible, that while human nature remains the same, men will ever become entirely indifferent to their power, riches, beauty or personal merit, and that their pride and vanity will not be affected by these advantages?",
  "43574": "Well, sir, what can I do?",
  "43575": "But where to now?",
  "43576": "Aramis here?",
  "43577": "How can you imagine it, since he has so lately declined everything from you?",
  "43578": "And what for?",
  "43579": "There's no likelihood of her running away or eloping?",
  "43580": "But who can see her as I have seen, who can know what her life has been, and not love her?",
  "43581": "Do you think any hint has reached her?",
  "43582": "Was that real or not?",
  "43583": "And will any duchess or countess rank with her?",
  "43584": "You are keeping the school there again, just as formerly?",
  "43585": "Worked here before?",
  "43586": "Peggotty go away from you?",
  "43587": "And in the sun?",
  "43588": "Have you not?",
  "43589": "Which field?",
  "43590": "How dare you trespass?",
  "43591": "What do you do in the circus?",
  "43592": "How could I understand all human affairs, ancient and modern, in the world?",
  "43593": "What is the good of your stars and trees, your sunrise and the wind, if they do not enter into our daily lives?",
  "43594": "My dear boys, what are you thinking about?",
  "43595": "I asked you if you knew him?",
  "43596": "What was it?",
  "43597": "And what of the country's people?",
  "43598": "And will you allow me the privilege of an old friend, of looking in upon you now and then?",
  "43599": "But do you believe you could arrest the progress of two horses rushing forwards with ungovernable fury?",
  "43600": "Stop, you wicked man, why did you look into the forbidden room?",
  "43601": "Has he lost his wealth at sea?",
  "43602": "Mercedes?",
  "43603": "Who told you that, my dear?",
  "43604": "How could one not love him?",
  "43605": "Silent still?",
  "43606": "Was it actually in the room?",
  "43607": "But on which side is truth?",
  "43608": "Would it not have been better that we should remain friends?",
  "43609": "But how can we follow him?",
  "43610": "Do you mean to state what your complaint against this boy is, man, or do you not?",
  "43611": "Now what?",
  "43612": "What did he see?",
  "43613": "Is it not the rushing of the wolves you have mentioned?",
  "43614": "For what?",
  "43615": "Should he impose his galleys on those two dazzling children, or should he consummate his irremediable engulfment by himself?",
  "43616": "Where do you hide 'em?",
  "43617": "What mercies or what sins of men are you talking of?",
  "43618": "Do you require the word?",
  "43619": "What place and what season can be goodlier than this?",
  "43620": "To what do you allude, monsieur?",
  "43621": "Poor fellow, what is it?",
  "43622": "Liver out of order?",
  "43623": "After what they had seen, could the travelers solve it?",
  "43624": "Did I think them stupid, obscure, inexact?",
  "43625": "Quis vatum discursus erat?",
  "43626": "What were they all?",
  "43627": "Have you been, or are you, his mistress?",

  "44815": "Well, has anybody come out?",
  "44816": "Will they not do and say anything to prevent him from yielding to his better nature and to render his teacher powerless, using to this end private intrigues as well as public prosecutions?",
  "44817": "When the lessons of experience fell from the lips of infancy?",
  "44818": "I mean to ask if you are married?",
  "44819": "Do you suppose I can doubt it?",
  "44820": "Sir, you are tempting me?",
  "44821": "But should we not find any fisherman and should the wind shift to the north?",
  "44822": "Is it in such a situation, with such notions, that the sentiments of nature unfold themselves, or habits of education become mild and peaceful?",
  "44823": "What feed shall I use?",
  "44824": "Then it's a very merry place, I suppose?",
  "44825": "Suppose the queen should refuse to ratify it?",
  "44826": "And how could you have hoped to escape, after you had struck me thus in the midst of my soldiers?",
  "44827": "Did not I say that things would come right of themselves?",
  "44828": "O how could they laugh about it that way?",
  "44829": "I suppose you can stay?",
  "44830": "And why is it contrary, unless it be more shocking than any delicate satire?",
  "44831": "What, then?",
  "44832": "And why does your mother say so?",
  "44833": "Do you know my crime, my lord?",
  "44834": "And was it all because you are so fond of your liberty?",
  "44835": "Had he failed?",
  "44836": "Why was it bad?",
  "44837": "His luggage?",
  "44838": "Do you intend opening the door?",
  "44839": "But why do spirits walk the earth, and why do they come to me?",
  "44840": "Lui, marchand?",
  "44841": "Then what are you going to look for?",
  "44842": "But now what is to be done?",
  "44843": "Is he convicted of robbery?",
  "44844": "Were my parents so, when they gave me to you?",
  "44845": "They do me no harm, I hope?",
  "44846": "Could it be possible?",
  "44847": "And we start in his carriage, then?",
  "44848": "Why in thunder should anyone follow or watch me?",
  "44849": "Nor that?",
  "44850": "Is my house come to that?",
  "44851": "But you are not so much so on my account?",
  "44852": "Do you want to see me in the prisoner's dock with criminals, in a court of justice?",
  "44853": "Seventeen, you mean?",
  "44854": "I am told it is a delightful place?",
  "44855": "You heard about that, I suppose?",
  "44856": "What did he do yesterday?",
  "44857": "What madness or folly leads me to speak of the faults of others, when there is so much to be said about my own?",
  "44858": "But what's she to do while we're away?",
  "44859": "Was he rehearsing some speech in his sleep, or was it a fragment of a phrase from some newspaper article?",
  "44860": "Can we take him out?",
  "44861": "Why do we hold ourselves under obligations to pass such a law, and abide by it when it is passed?",
  "44862": "Are fires kindled on graves, why, and at what time, and for how long?",
  "44863": "Might I have expected it?",
  "44864": "Who had placed those rocks and stones like cromlechs of prehistoric times?",
  "44865": "Is it heaven that opens before me?",
  "44866": "So you'd have them burned?",
  "44867": "What is that noise?",
  "44868": "Perhaps he would come a little sooner if you were to press it?",
  "44869": "Excellency, how could I, how could I prevent it?",
  "44870": "Do you know what they do?",
  "44871": "How long?",
  "44872": "Why spoil the pleasure of our friends by inflicting on them fashionable toilettes on this day of vigorous exercise in the country?",
  "44873": "Why are you the officer in charge now?",
  "44874": "You like music too?",
  "44875": "ARE we safe?",
  "44876": "Your own little share?",
  "44877": "Would it suit you to see them in the darkness of the night?",
  "44878": "Or doth it sit behind a big stone and catch flies?",
  "44879": "And then will he slay me?",
  "44880": "Regarding that as done, is there nothing I can do for you yourself?",
  "44881": "If he wished to injure it why could he not do it there?",
  "44882": "And it turned out that it was not at all because of you he was taken up?",
  "44883": "What has to be done?",
  "44884": "Why, pray, did you not tell me this, then, but excited with hopes a rustic and aged man?",
  "44885": "Is she HERE?",
  "44886": "The cowardliest?",
  "44887": "Would the doctor assist him in preventing this marriage?",
  "44888": "Is there?",
  "44889": "Yes, but are you good enough for it?",
  "44890": "To seek me?",
  "44891": "It is not he, is it?",
  "44892": "What is life?",
  "44893": "The very course he swung to this day noon?",
  "44894": "Now, what is the difference between such actions, when performed by an uncultivated man, and by one of the higher animals?",
  "44895": "And had I not been miserable with less dishonor, if I had met with a more severe and inhuman enemy?",
  "44896": "Have they fed him?",
  "44897": "But who knows whether then you will still wish to elevate him whom you now love, to be your husband?",
  "44898": "Is there no other road?",
  "44899": "Do you mean a whopper?",
  "44900": "Easy you think, eh?",
  "44901": "And your present happiness, has it softened your heart?",
  "44902": "How dare you think of staying here one moment, and refuse my wife the honours that belong to her as such?",
  "44903": "Anyone else?",
  "44904": "And why did I rush off to him just now like a lunatic, and drag him back here?",
  "44905": "Of spiritual profit?",
  "44906": "What is this bird?",
  "44907": "A professor?",
  "44908": "How are we to know whither chance will carry us?",
  "44909": "Are you stopping here?",
  "44910": "Or which must end me, a fool's wrath or love?",
  "44911": "Now, has she deserved this punishment?",
  "44912": "And may I not paint one like it for you?",
  "44913": "Why?",
  "44914": "What's the use of a lot of capital lying dead?",
  "44915": "What on earth will they expect me to talk about?",
  "44916": "Are you strong enough to stand?",
  "44917": "So I may give him your word of honour, may I, that in case of extremity you will stand by her?",
  "44918": "Would that do?",
  "44919": "You fear to see my naked blade?",
  "44920": "My idea?",
  "44921": "Why is she unhappy, I wonder?",
  "44922": "May I use it?",
  "44923": "Have I ever seen one?",
  "44924": "Months?",
  "44925": "You have abandoned the king?",
  "44926": "Where were you when you began to feel bad?",
  "44927": "Who let you loose?",
  "44928": "Is any one the less ill because one does not know the name of one's malady?",
  "44929": "I ridiculous?",
  "44930": "Are you armed?",
  "44931": "But may there not be a more or less vague and evanescent sense of tension, and some psychic fact which may be regarded as the shadowy forerunner of the consciousness of the release of tension which, on a higher plane, reveals itself as the consciousness of will?",
  "44932": "Do you know me, madame?",
  "44933": "Crack my son over the head, will you, you hardhearted, murtherin' divil?",
  "44934": "By what wickedness cometh this child here?",
  "44935": "Was he feeling badly?",
  "44936": "Is not this the most profound ignorance of human nature?",
  "44937": "Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?",
  "44938": "Do you think I should remember all about my mother's death if I were out of my mind?",
  "44939": "Do you forget that?",
  "44940": "And if each proprietor is sovereign lord within the sphere of his property, absolute king throughout his own domain, how could a government of proprietors be any thing but chaos and confusion?",
  "44941": "Was it very edifying and instructive?",
  "44942": "Must this last formality take place in your presence, sir?",
  "44943": "Do you attend the family?",
  "44944": "Who knows, when I shall be at liberty, that I may not satisfy your curiosity?",
  "44945": "Was it the devil who rang it?",
  "44946": "Is it unfaithfulness to my husband?",
  "44947": "The train is at three?",
  "44948": "Did you ever see me carry dishes?",
  "44949": "How is such a man to be worked on?",
  "44950": "What murderous spectacle is this?",
  "44951": "What do you suggest?",
  "44952": "Have you nothing to show your cousin anywhere about, not even a rabbit or a weasel's nest?",
  "44953": "Have you ever heard of him?",
  "44954": "Had he not corn enough?",
  "44955": "What weapons shall you select?",
  "44956": "Mamma, how can you go back in that way?",
  "44957": "Then no misfortune has happened to you?",
  "44958": "Is the island inhabited then?",
  "44959": "Who's that curtseying there?",
  "44960": "What happens?",
  "44961": "You have plenty of vermin to deal with, I suppose?",
  "44962": "What have you got to say, sir?",
  "44963": "You have news for me?",
  "44964": "Do you know anything?",
  "44965": "Are we not arriving too late?",
  "44966": "Is he not?",
  "44967": "Outside?",
  "44968": "Can it be possible we could be like husband and wife, alone, your family with you?",
  "44969": "What is the matter with him?",
  "44970": "Dare I look at her?",
  "44971": "And what are you going to do?",
  "44972": "What does she want now?",
  "44973": "You will not desert him?",
  "44974": "Do you make money or do you not make it?",
  "44975": "I had seen the man robbed, what else could I have done?",
  "44976": "You're not sending the horses off yet?",
  "44977": "What atones?",
  "44978": "My daughter, my daughter, why did you die?",
  "44979": "What shall we do exactly?",
  "44980": "But what has become of them all?",
  "44981": "But what was it, my love?",
  "44982": "Why does she say that?",
  "44983": "What do you advise me to do?",
  "44984": "And therefore to acknowledge that bad and good are the same?",
  "44985": "Shall I tell him to wait?",
  "44986": "What do we find?",
  "44987": "Is that right?",
  "44988": "Well, my dear, and how are we getting on?",
  "44989": "How many men have you here?",
  "44990": "What are you going as?",
  "44991": "You mean if there's a weak place?",
  "44992": "WHAT OUGHT I TO DO?",
  "44993": "Does he know I am his mother really?",
  "44994": "May I make a compact with you?",
  "44995": "Who and what are the two men of whom you speak?",
  "44996": "What are you saying, doctor?",
  "44997": "Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I WAS uncivil?",
  "44998": "What's this?",
  "44999": "Did you find him?",
  "45000": "Where is he?",
  "45001": "And since when have you become afraid of a quarrel?",
  "45002": "Where are they taking you to, you poor dear?",
  "45003": "Why, how wet it is?",
  "45004": "Suppose he finds out, and your brother, and your betrothed?",
  "45005": "Did he give any explanation of his conduct?",
  "45006": "Corcoran?",
  "45007": "How ever did you get along in a sledge?",
  "45008": "Ah, indeed?",
  "45009": "Does it exist?",
  "45010": "How many?",
  "45011": "In what manner?",
  "45012": "Will it drive me out of my mind?",
  "45013": "Would she, aunt?",
  "45014": "Pretty?",
  "45015": "Well, have you seen him?",
  "45016": "Is this one also a complementary colour?",
  "45017": "Farebrother?",
  "45018": "I wonder who he was?",
  "45019": "And when can I see this young lady, for whom I already feel so great a sympathy?",
  "45020": "Let him profit by the means as I found out?",
  "45021": "What's that about six pound a year?",
  "45022": "What is it, then, sire?",
  "45023": "You are quite sure that you do not want to sell your land?",
  "45024": "How are delights and miseries to be weighed, and reasonably balanced?",
  "45025": "In exchange for that you refuse me?",
  "45026": "Are you going to tell me that it is impossible?",
  "45027": "May I look?",
  "45028": "And what did you learn from him?",
  "45029": "How was the play?",
  "45030": "But does it shut equally well?",
  "45031": "What's yo' name?",
  "45032": "How near do you get to it?",
  "45033": "And who is the magistrate who has reason to complain of the agent?",
  "45034": "Who are you talking of?",
  "45035": "I wonder if I shall ever be happy enough to have real lace on my clothes and bows on my caps?",
  "45036": "Did you think he was too good to go?",
  "45037": "Come, now?",
  "45038": "Marry whom?",
  "45039": "Was it not unhealthful?",
  "45040": "What happened during the night?",
  "45041": "If two and two made four when we were happy together, surely they make four now?",
  "45042": "How near to you?",
  "45043": "Has the queen any further commands for me now?",
  "45044": "May it not frighten her terribly?",
  "45045": "Are the oysters good?",
  "45046": "Which colour strikes most?",
  "45047": "When the devil would you have a man be afraid but when there is so much cause?",
  "45048": "But what happened ?",
  "45049": "But how came that first note to be inserted in your journal?",
  "45050": "Then addressing herself to me, asked, with ineffable complacency, if I was the person who had been so cruelly used by robbers?",
  "45051": "But why could he not tell you this?",
  "45052": "Unseen then?",
  "45053": "Will you give me an egg to eat?",
  "45054": "Would she ever live to see it?",
  "45055": "A cart?",
  "45056": "Will you sell your rapier?",
  "45057": "What is the reader's conceived opinion of the duties and labors of a missionary in a heathen land?",
  "45058": "But if his daily death was the theme of the legend, why was it celebrated by an annual ceremony?",
  "45059": "Old fellow, can you let me have thirty pounds?",
  "45060": "How do you manage to get people to talk about it?",
  "45061": "Did not you see me tip you the wink to leave off in time?",
  "45062": "A shilling a leg?",
  "45063": "Rid myself of that nightmare?",
  "45064": "Could there possibly have been a more exact guide?",
  "45065": "Why, do you think I should be any happier if I were to feel disturbed about the excavations you tell me of?",
  "45066": "But how am I to climb?",
  "45067": "What is your love to mine?",
  "45068": "Love covers a multitude of sins, and of whom could you ask more freely than of him?",
  "45069": "And who is she, this woman that you want to see?",
  "45070": "Still, are they going to do it shortly?",
  "45071": "And of what other trees?",
  "45072": "May we not conjecture that they belonged to the people who resided in the town, and who were victorious in the engagement?",
  "45073": "Could a man be born to a more perfect glory?",
  "45074": "You are vexed?",
  "45075": "You'll not say anything about it at home, will you?",
  "45076": "To our journey's end?",
  "45077": "To what unexpected good fortune, to what accident, am I to ascribe this happy meeting?",
  "45078": "How did it fare with the missions in these days of woe and terror?",
  "45079": "And how is everybody?",
  "45080": "Perhaps you'd like to spend a couple of shillings or so, in a bottle of currant wine by and by, up in the bedroom?",
  "45081": "With what object?",
  "45082": "Or is it the matter?",
  "45083": "Do you wish a step, or some place in the government?",
  "45084": "Would it not be better to rest now?",
  "45085": "But what then?",
  "45086": "Am I right or not?",
  "45087": "Why impossible?",
  "45088": "It is agreed, then, that I carry you off with me?",
  "45089": "Quite seriously?",
  "45090": "Who should prevent you?",
  "45091": "The vastness of this word?",
  "45092": "Whose horse is waiting at your gate?",
  "45093": "Why did you light the thirsty lamp?",
  "45094": "Would he be in time to rescue?",
  "45095": "How did he come to be there?",
  "45096": "The meeting?",
  "45097": "Why do you look first on one side and then on the other, as if you were afraid of being arrested yourself, you whose business it is to arrest others?",
  "45098": "Will your majesty deign to excuse me?",
  "45099": "Shall we say it is because we have won an empire?",
  "45100": "What do you talk about?",
  "45101": "How can his readers take on trust his statements concerning the births, marriages, divorces, and deaths of a crowd of people, whose names are scarcely known to this generation?",
  "45102": "Or why should not all the three walk abreast?",
  "45103": "And is it so, maidy?",
  "45104": "Were they hungry?",
  "45105": "Do your ears tell you that they have traced our retreat?",
  "45106": "What made you sit in such an awkward position?",
  "45107": "Is not this the way in which the large landed proprietors have gradually raised their rents, as fast as they have ascertained by the increase in population and the development of industry how much society can produce from their property?",
  "45108": "Why are you so very shy, and so very sombre?",
  "45109": "What other initiative, what greater authority, do you ask?",
  "45110": "Why do you serve in this capacity?",
  "45111": "How do you like it?",
  "45112": "What month?",
  "45113": "More than in other years?",
  "45114": "But could he be sure that this was all that was to be said about this enigma, and that he should never arrive at a solution?",
  "45115": "Half a mile, you say?",
  "45116": "Has anything happened, ma'am?",
  "45117": "Where is the man who brought the letter?",
  "45118": "Whither am I going?",
  "45119": "Shall I have it, or shall I not?",
  "45120": "And all my limbs unbroken?",
  "45121": "Why did they?",
  "45122": "Do you know where we could get one?",
  "45123": "Well, and you want your fortune told?",
  "45124": "Was it his wife, or else as like her as any sister could be?",
  "45125": "Does that mean that all men have a right to all property?",
  "45126": "And can bear to have my morsel of bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my cup?",
  "45127": "One thing and another commit?",
  "45128": "Can you tell me, this last time, that you feel quite, quite sure, no new affections of mine, and no new duties of mine, will ever interpose between us?",
  "45129": "You remember all this quite clearly, but how is it that your reason calmly accepted all the manifest absurdities and impossibilities that crowded into your dream?",
  "45130": "What troops are these that seem to be passing through the wood?",
  "45131": "You'd never think it to look at me, would you?",
  "45132": "What shall I sing?",
  "45133": "Is there no gentleman or lady of virtue in this neighbourhood, to whom I may fly, only till l can find a way to get to my poor father and mother?",
  "45134": "What object could they have?",
  "45135": "And do you suppose she understands nothing?",
  "45136": "Could I have caused that girl's death and procreated this being?",
  "45137": "What do the women find so impressive in that little brat?",
  "45138": "Well, sir?",
  "45139": "And I must cross it with silver, I suppose?",
  "45140": "A letter?",
  "45141": "Whom follow?",
  "45142": "What means this profession of faith?",
  "45143": "Again, if the uncooling or warm principle were imperishable, the fire when assailed by cold would not have perished or have been extinguished, but would have gone away unaffected?",
  "45144": "His wife?",
  "45145": "What place is that?",
  "45146": "Is not this thing which you advise me to do a little cowardly?",
  "45147": "Who has paid adulation to the nation while claiming for it a sovereignty which it was incapable of exercising?",
  "45148": "Have you not wished to go?",
  "45149": "Died he of sickness or through treachery?",
  "45150": "To how much?",
  "45151": "Why, why are people all balls of bitter dust?",
  "45152": "You tell me nothing?",
  "45153": "What means this?",
  "45154": "Who calls?",
  "45155": "Why should I deny it?",
  "45156": "What is the matter with them?",
  "45157": "Is it not inconceivable, that a tribune should have power to imprison a consul, and the people have no authority to degrade him when he uses that honor which he received from them, to their detriment?",
  "45158": "Now, children, which is it to be?",
  "45159": "Is the doctrine warranted by FACTS?",
  "45160": "Then what will you do with me then?",
  "45161": "Can anyone grasp what such an offer meant at such a spot, made to a man who, to tell the truth, is very fond of a smoke after meals?",
  "45162": "From whom had they that information?",
  "45163": "Shall I ever see your sister?",
  "45164": "Then your duchess is still at the waters?",
  "45165": "Have you heard anything of the case?",
  "45166": "Do you wish to try to do so?",
  "45167": "After all, he said in his bitterness, what can a woman care about so much as house and furniture?",
  "45168": "What was his devotion worth to her?",
  "45169": "I suppose I could walk with the rest?",
  "45170": "But why waste more words on them?",
  "45171": "What was it fell last night from the evil moon?",
  "45172": "Just as she was, in a manner, pretending to listen?",
  "45173": "Two words?",
  "45174": "It was he who told you to invite me to appear with these studs?",
  "45175": "And how were they treated?",
  "45176": "Do you bring me a message from the king, or have you made a bold hit, and wish me to take you again under my protection?",
  "45177": "How many times have we seen it?",
  "45178": "Well, then, what possessed you to go down there this time of night?",
  "45179": "And do you know who is his lieutenant?",
  "45180": "I suppose that's what your humanity would suggest?",
  "45181": "And are you going away, then, really?",
  "45182": "Do you not know that you have been dead this long time?",
  "45183": "How long a delay do you wish for?",
  "45184": "Well, what will you give for it?",
  "45185": "What evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of your senses?",
  "45186": "But should you not interfere?",
  "45187": "Mademoiselle, how could you believe that?",
  "45188": "Do you understand what the word pity means?",
  "45189": "You mean it makes you feel that you have nothing?",
  "45190": "But what about women?",
  "45191": "Besides, how could one land on the opposite bank among willows which would scuttle the boat, and with a flood of unknown extent?",
  "45192": "Have I, indeed, said anything you should answer with such a cruel remark?",
  "45193": "What hinders it?",
  "45194": "Now, if some are discernible by the naked eye, and others are detected in such varying sizes that some can only just be distinguished by the most powerful lens, is it not rational to conclude that the smallest discernible to human intelligence is but the medium of a countless race?",
  "45195": "So what have you done with it?",
  "45196": "You mean when a woman has children?",
  "45197": "What is there to surprise anyone in that?",
  "45198": "If I only had it here, wretch that I am, what more should we want?",
  "45199": "Well, monseigneur?",
  "45200": "Do you wish me to begin admiring the peoples?",
  "45201": "Do I not myself know that I am at this moment in want of a dozen pages, and that I am sick with cudgelling my brains to find them?",
  "45202": "Did you observe any one during the first act?",
  "45203": "Have you heard the news?",
  "45204": "And what IS this on my head?",
  "45205": "Why deceive us further?",
  "45206": "And by whom are you forbidden?",
  "45207": "Who has done this?",
  "45208": "And who was that man?",
  "45209": "What happened to you?",
  "45210": "What put her up to clearing out?",
  "45211": "Well, sire?",
  "45212": "Any answer?",
  "45213": "How do you do?",
  "45214": "And so, is it quite certain he is coming?",
  "45215": "If nobody were rich, who would employ the poor?",
  "45216": "And what do you expect the king to reply?",
  "45217": "But if she does?",
  "45218": "Where is he who could say it no?",
  "45219": "I have surely not been dreaming, have I?",
  "45220": "Shall we light a fire, so as to signal our presence on the coast?",
  "45221": "Do you think of dying, my lord?",
  "45222": "What does the poetry or the value of the ring signify?",
  "45223": "What do you believe, what do you KNOW?",
  "45224": "How's my poor brother?",
  "45225": "Is he so hard, then?",
  "45226": "Why did you come?",
  "45227": "Oh, mother, what is the matter?",
  "45228": "And what house is this?",
  "45229": "What, no second club?",
  "45230": "Will fish go down with them?",
  "45231": "May it not, theoretically, include as much of the universe as is known to man?",
  "45232": "Is it my affair?",
  "45233": "I, madame?",
  "45234": "Why should you go about the parish?",
  "45235": "Who is this ancient teacher or who is his prototype if he is an ideal being?",
  "45236": "What could those words mean?",
  "45237": "Did you never do any robbery in your life?",
  "45238": "What devil?",
  "45239": "Why are we less prompt to provide for our own safety than the rest of the citizens?",
  "45240": "I said, do you hear me?",
  "45241": "For what purpose?",
  "45242": "Is his hour past?",
  "45243": "Do you know of any other?",
  "45244": "For how, under different wills, should we find complete unity of ends?",
  "45245": "Did you ever see anything to equal it, as you steam away in the sunset?",
  "45246": "Were you thinking of your birth then?",
  "45247": "Look at a plant in the midst of its range, why does it not double or quadruple its numbers?",
  "45248": "Am I too heavy?",
  "45249": "Shall we agree to this plan, or not?",
  "45250": "Buy back your wheelbarrow?",
  "45251": "Do they begin by exciting the detestation of the very instruments of their intended usurpations?",
  "45252": "But, surely, if he were convinced that it was absolutely necessary for the vindication of his innocence, he would submit to charge himself with an expense so necessary, not only for himself, but for his family?",
  "45253": "Up so early?",
  "45254": "Do I know you?",
  "45255": "His things and his bag are with him?",
  "45256": "Another shock, eh?",
  "45257": "Can I trust you?",
  "45258": "Other people's?",
  "45259": "And did you see her just now, as she spoke of her father?",
  "45260": "And fought?",
  "45261": "Was there no other who contributed?",
  "45262": "Under what obligation do I lie of making such an abuse of time?",
  "45263": "Could any other man express what they knew so well how to express in tones and in words?",
  "45264": "But what book is that next it?",
  "45265": "It surely cannot be you who made shoes for me at the l'ecole militaire?",
  "45266": "How must I do?",
  "45267": "But how, sir, said I, did you part?",
  "45268": "Where was the first lion?",
  "45269": "What is its name?",
  "45270": "That is, you mean that sin keeps him back?",
  "45271": "To whom was this letter addressed?",
  "45272": "Carlo, did I offer any violence?",
  "45273": "But if there be anything which is of such a nature as to be and not to be, that will have a place intermediate between pure being and the absolute negation of being?",
  "45274": "Who are your uncles and aunts?",
  "45275": "What was he saying yesterday?",
  "45276": "If much comfort cannot be expected from the friendship of a reformed rake of superior abilities, what is the consequence when he lacketh sense, as well as principles?",
  "45277": "And do you think I ever shall?",
  "45278": "Why do you want me?",
  "45279": "I ask you what year is it?",
  "45280": "What sent you hither?",
  "45281": "Was such a thing ever heard of?",
  "45282": "What had she to do with the justice or injustice of other people?",
  "45283": "Which is it to be, death or life?",
  "45284": "How will they proceed?",
  "45285": "Not a cloud?",
  "45286": "What has that boy been about?",
  "45287": "Or any other time?",
  "45288": "Are they not already in the land?",
  "45289": "What did they want there?",
  "45290": "To which?",
  "45291": "The surface of a sphere?",
  "45292": "Are they happy?",
  "45293": "Is it a good road, and how far?",
  "45294": "And the lord chamberlain?",
  "45295": "Mayor?",
  "45296": "Had you ever any reason to complain of him?",
  "45297": "Will you promise me then to be at peace?",
  "45298": "A voyage?",
  "45299": "And they found the child?",
  "45300": "Yet what will the energy of true genius not effect?",
  "45301": "What is there to hinder?",
  "45302": "Is it a lonely farm?",
  "45303": "And can I play with him, too?",
  "45304": "Why do I want to go?",
  "45305": "What business, said she, had you to read my letter?",
  "45306": "Or, if it ought to give any, what are the different parts of education which it ought to attend to in the different orders of the people?",
  "45307": "What time did he set off for town?",
  "45308": "And are you coming with us?",
  "45309": "When had that question been settled?",
  "45310": "Had he travelled?",
  "45311": "And why have you such an air of sadness aboard?",
  "45312": "And what has become of the business?",
  "45313": "Was it an instant of enchantment only or long hours and years and ages?",
  "45314": "Is the lady so very alarming?",
  "45315": "And how is it possible to help losing a stronghold that is not relieved, above all when surrounded by a host of determined enemies in their own country?",
  "45316": "Your marriage?",
  "45317": "Your aunt?",
  "45318": "By means of what organ?",
  "45319": "What DOES the face matter?",
  "45320": "All of it?",
  "45321": "Is he lost, I wonder, in this desert?",
  "45322": "Can you enlighten me on that point?",
  "45323": "What makes her want to see ye?",
  "45324": "Do you mean to ask this girl to marry you?",
  "45325": "Are you quite well?",
  "45326": "And what this?",
  "45327": "Did not his land produce sufficient of everything?",
  "45328": "When did it break out?",
  "45329": "Why add up the elements of resistance and anarchy?",
  "45330": "And pray, if you are so good, who ventures to affirm that?",
  "45331": "What for?",
  "45332": "What are you thinking of doing?",
  "45333": "How could we live and where could we live?",
  "45334": "Is it so nice as all that?",
  "45335": "But what do I say?",
  "45336": "Whom does this belong to?",
  "45337": "Who are you, my good man?",
  "45338": "Had I dreamt?",
  "45339": "Why did she so lose courage?",
  "45340": "And can you not understand why I said fortune favours us?",
  "45341": "What's the use of living?",
  "45342": "Are you well and happy?",
  "45343": "What to do?",
  "45344": "Did the sun, which shone so brightly everywhere else, really fall upon him?",
  "45345": "And if there is truth in what has preceded, he will be wedded to an image of pleasure which is thrice removed as to truth from the pleasure of the oligarch?",
  "45346": "What brings you here, dear heart?",
  "45347": "What were they now?",
  "45348": "You understand what I say?",
  "45349": "Will it be said that the opposition between man and the divine being is illusory, and that it arises from the opposition that exists between the individual man and the essence of entire humanity?",
  "45350": "Are they in safety?",
  "45351": "Sneezed, did you?",
  "45352": "I'm not?",
  "45353": "Have you forgotten that a son ought to love and honour his father and mother?",
  "45354": "Had the remembrance of her teaching utterly vanished, and the last trace of her maternal influence quite faded away?",
  "45355": "What do you want with me?",
  "45356": "You are staying the whole evening, I hope?",
  "45357": "What weight would that carry?",
  "45358": "Good gracious, what noise is that?",
  "45359": "Have you seen the princess?",
  "45360": "Is it because there is no word tender enough to be your name?",
  "45361": "So you wanted to get away, my dear, did you?",
  "45362": "Did it not show that he comprehended his relations with her?",
  "45363": "What need of positive law where natural justice is, of itself, a sufficient restraint?",
  "45364": "But how was it settled between you, mamma?",
  "45365": "What means this?",
  "45366": "What is it that is strange?",
  "45367": "Coming in to have a short time?",
  "45368": "Do you reproach me?",
  "45369": "And what do you pick your teeth with, after devouring that fat goose?",
  "45370": "Had not his books taught him that he was a man?",
  "45371": "And will you mention to me the yearly sum which would repay you for managing these affairs which we have discussed together?",
  "45372": "What'll be over?",
  "45373": "But then, what are we here for?",
  "45374": "You have?",
  "45375": "De qui?",
  "45376": "What was it, my dear?",
  "45377": "She was young, you say?",
  "45378": "His effect?",
  "45379": "What is life to you?",
  "45380": "Where are you living now?",
  "45381": "Have they?",
  "45382": "Shall my messenger, in your name, tell your people to give in?",
  "45383": "And does he still tip you?",
  "45384": "If he forsakes his faith, how doth it profit you?",
  "45385": "Why do you do such a strange thing?",
  "45386": "Why did you think so?",
  "45387": "Does he say so now?",
  "45388": "And both should be in harmony?",
  "45389": "Why, you love him, do you not?",
  "45390": "I hope I am doing nothing wrong in asking it again?",
  "45391": "Had he spoken of himself, of himself as he was or wished to be?",
  "45392": "If he did not, what would she do?",
  "45393": "And ought not the same natures to have the same pursuits?",
  "45394": "What next?",
  "45395": "Why did it happen?",
  "45396": "But our troop horses?",
  "45397": "Nay, tell me, how many histories are there filled with these marvels?",
  "45398": "Do you mind my smoking?",
  "45399": "How, then, does this passion for gain, abandoned to itself, turn to the prejudice of society?",
  "45400": "If a kiss had been imprinted?",
  "45401": "Well, do you attend the function tonight?",
  "45402": "But they have wisdom, else what is the use of having died?",
  "45403": "Always a muddle?",
  "45404": "Have I given no testimony of my sincerity and of my passion?",
  "45405": "That's everything?",
  "45406": "Is this the same lemonade of which you partook?",
  "45407": "And what does he charge?",
  "45408": "But the horses?",
  "45409": "In summer?",
  "45410": "And what the devil was the matter with his head?",
  "45411": "Why do we love?",
  "45412": "And what do the rulers call the people?",
  "45413": "And how much was the residue?",
  "45414": "What do you think he replied?",
  "45415": "Or is it equally criminal in every body?",
  "45416": "Perhaps you think I shall abandon you, dear grandpapa, and that I shall forget you when I am married?",
  "45417": "What's coming next?",
  "45418": "Suppose we had attained our end, would it not have been better to have found continents in broad daylight than a country plunged in utter darkness?",
  "45419": "Did your father speak of it?",
  "45420": "What was that noise?",
  "45421": "What made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here?",
  "45422": "An old hag who said her son had the plague?",
  "45423": "How then was it closed?",
  "45424": "But, if from their birth men and women are placed in a torrid zone, with the meridian sun of pleasure darting directly upon them, how can they sufficiently brace their minds to discharge the duties of life, or even to relish the affections that carry them out of themselves?",
  "45425": "What is the cause of all this?",
  "45426": "What do I seek on the height?",
  "45427": "Have the enemy called in any foreign help?",
  "45428": "Lost her memory, eh?",
  "45429": "And pray who are the persons who exhaust your fortune?",
  "45430": "You did not recognise me?",
  "45431": "How shall I break through them?",
  "45432": "That your own bunk over on that side?",
  "45433": "Is this a fact?",
  "45434": "But where, where was this self, this innermost part, this ultimate part?",
  "45435": "What have I to consider?",
  "45436": "Had she succeeded in extracting the secret, and awakening in that adamant heart a last faint touch of pity?",
  "45437": "And will you transfer me to your brother?",
  "45438": "Indeed formerly you were wont to give us some freely, and will you not now let us have any for our money?",
  "45439": "How did it come about, I wonder, that the elder officers are not here to interfere with anything you do?",
  "45440": "Natasha, what is it about?",
  "45441": "I may turn my back on this town a few hours sooner than I intended, but what of that?",
  "45442": "How are they?",
  "45443": "Divide it by three, and what is the result?",
  "45444": "Would I speak to you if he did?",
  "45445": "Where shall I go to find you?",
  "45446": "And the casks?",
  "45447": "Said I, is there here a new world?",
  "45448": "Hamlet's which?",
  "45449": "And suppose some learned traveller should come across these specimens, eh?",
  "45450": "Dare you pretend to rouse him against me?",
  "45451": "Is it possible that you consider the sea to be greater now than formerly?",
  "45452": "Where are your reindeer?",
  "45453": "Why was it I wanted to tell him and did not tell him?",
  "45454": "Have I not a wife?",
  "45455": "What time are you supposed to return?",
  "45456": "Why, what are these doing, who are bent down so much?",
  "45457": "Five pounds?",
  "45458": "But why do you wish to bind yourself?",
  "45459": "Say, is it possible?",
  "45460": "You've bought our inn?",
  "45461": "If he were not only to sink from his highest resolve, but to sink into the hideous fettering of domestic hate?",
  "45462": "Must one not surrender his right when he is unable to recover it?",
  "45463": "Why are you so careful, so tender, of this one wrong and no other?",
  "45464": "How am I to pay them?",
  "45465": "You hear that?",
  "45466": "I hope you will not object to my remaining at home, sir?",
  "45467": "And you have brought him back here?",
  "45468": "Should he speak to her?",
  "45469": "And the first?",
  "45470": "How can one describe a man?",
  "45471": "Do you know what you look like, all together, as you are armed and guarded by your lackeys?",
  "45472": "Besides, if women are educated for dependence, that is, to act according to the will of another fallible being, and submit, right or wrong, to power, where are we to stop?",
  "45473": "Do you believe him to be implicated?",
  "45474": "Now, what are you waiting for?",
  "45475": "Have you got the pipe?",
  "45476": "Is it surprising, that such a tasteless being should rather caress this dog than her children?",
  "45477": "Of how many does it consist?",
  "45478": "How could they learn, how calculate, in the midst of this night?",
  "45479": "What satisfaction could a woman of delicacy promise herself in a union with such a man, when the very artlessness of her affection might appear insipid?",
  "45480": "Are not the two sexes made for one another?",
  "45481": "Are these bears here?",
  "45482": "No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of mine?",
  "45483": "When will he come?",
  "45484": "What misfortune has happened then?",
  "45485": "Were they TO BE or BORN TO BE?",
  "45486": "And how far from the edge of the wood?",
  "45487": "When you get through working your horses this fall, will you turn them out in the snow?",
  "45488": "If it's all wrong, why does he read them?",
  "45489": "This famous invention of yours?",
  "45490": "But what are you shouting for?",
  "45491": "Or what is your name?",
  "45492": "Do you mind him only having two noises?",
  "45493": "Was that poetry?",
  "45494": "Have we done?",
  "45495": "Why take less critical utilitarians as the only exponents of the school?",
  "45496": "And where do you find them?",
  "45497": "Should he, on the very threshold of such an errand, be afraid?",
  "45498": "Are you married, or are you not?",
  "45499": "The lamps are right, are they?",
  "45500": "For what purpose is your question?",
  "45501": "No luck for old fellows, then, my sweet bud of the wilderness?",
  "45502": "Did the other boys do so?",
  "45503": "Is it possible to transmit a projectile up to the moon?",
  "45504": "Would you like my carbine?",
  "45505": "So you do remember some things?",
  "45506": "Off I go where?",
  "45507": "And would not my four months' silence appear to him a tacit acceptance of our situation?",
  "45508": "Pray is your lodger within?",
  "45509": "What is easier, you know?",
  "45510": "What, you must leave?",
  "45511": "But how can I?",
  "45512": "What is it you want, dear grandpapa?",
  "45513": "Shall the air never again be lighted with the glare of our guns?",
  "45514": "Had this sphinx his fore paws in crime and his hind paws in authority?",
  "45515": "Are you satisfied, you great fool?",
  "45516": "Was he sure of his man?",
  "45517": "Where is the villain?",
  "45518": "You have already sworn the oath of secrecy and fidelity, and you are aware that the punishment for any breach of it is instant and inevitable death?",
  "45519": "Now what is this?",
  "45520": "Did they try to fight you when you saw 'em?",
  "45521": "Your excellency, how come you to be here?",
  "45522": "Well, then, a horse?",
  "45523": "As valiant as was that other?",
  "45524": "Alas, but that sentence is a puddle, is it not?",
  "45525": "I really, my dear, described to you a manner?",
  "45526": "You pelief, ten, in te possibilty of te odd ?",
  "45527": "Why is man, who was born for society, not yet associated?",
  "45528": "Yet in what respect can she be termed good?",
  "45529": "If it makes you invis'ble, why do you eat it?",
  "45530": "When do you wish me to go and find your father?",
  "45531": "And what news hear you?",
  "45532": "Might I see you sew it up?",
  "45533": "Is he a deputy?",
  "45534": "Do say something more?",
  "45535": "You're not afraid of the snow melting first?",
  "45536": "But how?",
  "45537": "Is it very late, mother?",
  "45538": "How are ye, lads?",
  "45539": "What next, I mean?",
  "45540": "And now, what must we do?",
  "45541": "Will this closet suit you, my brother?",
  "45542": "How could I answer?",
  "45543": "What of that?",
  "45544": "Is there any particular and special reason for your being unable to do either?",
  "45545": "Why will not the marechal advance me a portion of my patrimony?",
  "45546": "What were you crying for?",
  "45547": "Will you mount?",
  "45548": "Did you never observe, I said, the effect on the mind itself of exclusive devotion to gymnastic, or the opposite effect of an exclusive devotion to music?",
  "45549": "Still attracts a little, eh?",
  "45550": "Did his spirit sink as he approached his dreary home, oppressed with a dark foreboding of what the future should bring forth?",
  "45551": "So you DID get here, after all?",
  "45552": "Early?",
  "45553": "What is it that really happens?",
  "45554": "Equally?",
  "45555": "And now, how can I retrace the impression left upon me by that walk under the waters?",
  "45556": "How can she know how much we think of our darling?",
  "45557": "There was an advertisement of yours in the papers this morning?",
  "45558": "A being?",
  "45559": "Will you not come and choose your own beasts tomorrow?",
  "45560": "What can I say on the matter?",
  "45561": "And how was she to divide the guests between the marquee and the parlour?",
  "45562": "Did you get my note?",
  "45563": "Well, then, what can be done?",
  "45564": "Sell them?",
  "45565": "Well, is the plaid dry?",
  "45566": "Will you not follow 'em?",
  "45567": "What wonder was it that this spot exercised a strong attraction upon each of us at the moment when we were to turn our backs upon it for good?",
  "45568": "Are all voters true to their high responsibilities?",
  "45569": "What can that matter to him?",
  "45570": "What do you think of her?",
  "45571": "Did she also see slowly, but surely, increasing traces of those long wrinkles on the forehead, those slender serpents that nothing can check?",
  "45572": "But how can I wear ornaments if you, who are the elder sister, will never wear them?",
  "45573": "But what matters that?",
  "45574": "What kind of country should we have to deal with?",
  "45575": "Had the word lost its power, or could the failing eye and weary sense no longer answer to the touch of that mighty inspiration?",
  "45576": "At their age?",
  "45577": "What would therefore be more open to him than to keep her in love with him?",

  "46356": "As handsome as her?",
  "46357": "Captain?",
  "46358": "Do I not fall?",
  "46359": "Papa, what are you doing that for?",
  "46360": "Did you or did you not?",
  "46361": "Oh, does he live there?",
  "46362": "But what will they find?",
  "46363": "Why have you shut it?",
  "46364": "Why do you tell me that I should practise what I preach?",
  "46365": "And what do they say of it in the world?",
  "46366": "What is the name to me?",
  "46367": "They have lost their best and bravest, and will the cowards dare to give us battle?",
  "46368": "Why not a tremendous man like him?",
  "46369": "And did you catch any of his words?",
  "46370": "Merchandise, curios?",
  "46371": "I suppose that is all right?",
  "46372": "Do you think he knows?",
  "46373": "It is extremely curious, is it not?",
  "46374": "Or at least write?",
  "46375": "Yes, but how about the instruments?",
  "46376": "And we shall answer?",
  "46377": "Am I keeping you?",
  "46378": "But what happened after my departure?",
  "46379": "Do you mind my putting on my waterproof and going to see if she got in?",
  "46380": "Does the crime consist in that relation?",
  "46381": "Why not then seek in the latter, the happiness which he had vainly dreamed of finding in the former?",
  "46382": "Will you ask him if I can see him for a moment?",
  "46383": "What is it that you advise and counsel me to do?",
  "46384": "Has a government, then, no authority over such as these, because they never consented to it, and would esteem the very attempt of such a free choice a piece of arrogance and impiety?",
  "46385": "What are you doing that for?",
  "46386": "Aeneid that so, doctor?",
  "46387": "Do you speak the truth, monsieur?",
  "46388": "What words?",
  "46389": "In that case you will send me to the prison, perhaps?",
  "46390": "But why should I die?",
  "46391": "Was I making any observation?",
  "46392": "What do you intend to do?",
  "46393": "What can it mean?",
  "46394": "Well, how are you getting on?",
  "46395": "Child, do you love me?",
  "46396": "Where's your home?",
  "46397": "Monopolist or speculator, what matters the name, if you admit the thing?",
  "46398": "In the night?",
  "46399": "Or why would grandfather have been so angry with you?",
  "46400": "Or was it that they understood the answers science gave to these problems in some different, clearer sense than he did?",
  "46401": "Why funny, what is funny?",
  "46402": "Oh, you naughty boy, fie for shame, what do you do so far away from home?",
  "46403": "For the rest, what do you object to in these books?",
  "46404": "You two alone?",
  "46405": "Where was there a more affectionate son, a pleasanter home than hers?",
  "46406": "What do you want of me?",
  "46407": "And shoot him, if guilty?",
  "46408": "Was that you?",
  "46409": "How like you this, my honourable lords?",
  "46410": "What public person?",
  "46411": "How old was this seductive woman now?",
  "46412": "Who gave you knowledge of your wife's being there?",
  "46413": "Detchard?",
  "46414": "What's the matter, what's the matter, mamma?",
  "46415": "No other captive friend to save?",
  "46416": "Who will be there?",
  "46417": "Did you ever see such a brute?",
  "46418": "Did you discover this passage by chance?",
  "46419": "Do you need money?",
  "46420": "Can I make myself not love him by just wishing it?",
  "46421": "Are they all dead?",
  "46422": "How, how am I to tell you what I mean?",
  "46423": "Why does he call me a screw?",
  "46424": "But what about birth, mother?",
  "46425": "How shall we cross the river?",
  "46426": "Where do you go, my wife?",
  "46427": "Where has he been living all these years?",
  "46428": "A farm?",
  "46429": "But tell me candidly, what joy has the departed, and, perhaps, suffering soul, in the fine music of the choir, even should the choir be composed of the best singers in the country?",
  "46430": "You had a mother too?",
  "46431": "What a pretty way that is, is'nt it?",
  "46432": "These are the records of your early work, then?",
  "46433": "What, then, is their standard?",
  "46434": "And what became of him?",
  "46435": "Now tell me, what is this large one for?",
  "46436": "Is there not more at stake for us than for him?",
  "46437": "That is to say you can readily distinguish a fortress from a simple fortification, such as is allowed to chatelains or vassals?",
  "46438": "Whom have you instructed to represent your pretended uncle?",
  "46439": "Do you want to go?",
  "46440": "Where did she do that?",
  "46441": "What do you mean by that, my darling boy?",
  "46442": "Where turn for a companion and for some hope?",
  "46443": "What if we are?",
  "46444": "What was the symbolic signification of a hedgehog?",
  "46445": "Can that be possible?",
  "46446": "Why linger ye?",
  "46447": "Would the search for him be difficult, or long?",
  "46448": "How's that for the first water?",
  "46449": "The traveler who has a lackey?",
  "46450": "Did he go into a frenzy in order to disguise his weakened powers from himself?",
  "46451": "Do widows carry symbols of their deceased children or husbands, and for how long?",
  "46452": "Well, how are you?",
  "46453": "What is to become of me?",
  "46454": "Who was the mother?",
  "46455": "You are well acquainted with it now?",
  "46456": "What says our aunt on the subject?",
  "46457": "Are there any other lions in this forest?",
  "46458": "You would, perhaps, care to remain during the consultation?",
  "46459": "But will you not go up?",
  "46460": "And what is this tree which resembles a little palm?",
  "46461": "And who was it that brought the tidings that snatched them from the jaws of death?",
  "46462": "Shall I have him?",
  "46463": "I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?",
  "46464": "How should I recover it?",
  "46465": "They'd need have some money, eh?",
  "46466": "Who is he, and where shall I find him?",
  "46467": "How could he get out of it?",
  "46468": "Why are you telling me these horrible stories?",
  "46469": "How did you come to be so observant?",
  "46470": "Where is the wood?",
  "46471": "In order to cause himself to be paid for his silence?",
  "46472": "I hope you are not angry with me, sir?",
  "46473": "What'll he bring, do you think?",
  "46474": "Why does he go his daily round, instead of wandering at large up and down the fields of heaven?",
  "46475": "But how do you get about?",
  "46476": "If they were more provident and less perverse, ma'am, what would they do?",
  "46477": "What is it you want?",
  "46478": "What do they mean by it?",
  "46479": "This affair does not, then, weigh upon your conscience?",
  "46480": "What question?",
  "46481": "Do you write a good hand?",
  "46482": "But if so, have you not fallen into a serious inconsistency in saying that men and women, whose natures are so entirely different, ought to perform the same actions?",
  "46483": "Have you not enjoyed the pleasures of the chase today?",
  "46484": "How long have you been looking?",
  "46485": "Whom seek you?",
  "46486": "But who knows when the sky will fall?",
  "46487": "When should you want to see me again?",
  "46488": "For the use of such ghosts as choose to inhabit it?",
  "46489": "What, you want to get rid of our horses?",
  "46490": "Why, now that you are here, are you the only one to wear a sad and mournful appearance and a long face, while all the others show their joy?",
  "46491": "Why, what do you know about tumblers?",
  "46492": "Why will you waste the precious time?",
  "46493": "How can there be any secrets, we are all the same organisms?",
  "46494": "Am I of age, father?",
  "46495": "Oh, then you DO intend to take a room?",
  "46496": "Is it monotonous?",
  "46497": "You admit that I shall not be chosen?",
  "46498": "So you think we shall win tomorrow's battle?",
  "46499": "Quis eo fuit unquam in partiundis rebus, in definiendis, in explanandis pressior?",
  "46500": "Ah, what will it mean?",
  "46501": "What was your object?",
  "46502": "Where are the horses?",
  "46503": "What is the hour?",
  "46504": "Well, and what will they be?",
  "46505": "You know that?",
  "46506": "You're quite sure you'll be safe in it?",
  "46507": "Who is the watchman here?",
  "46508": "Why should I be?",
  "46509": "When would he be like the fellows in poetry and rhetoric?",
  "46510": "If it was only for your sake, should I have urged this question?",
  "46511": "And I am the witness?",
  "46512": "Why should I, when both he and I were happier near than apart?",
  "46513": "Should every desire or group of desires receive recognition?",
  "46514": "And what came of it?",
  "46515": "Who are with him?",
  "46516": "Not because there is no one to believe in you?",
  "46517": "They get the sack, you mean?",
  "46518": "You think so, too?",
  "46519": "If my lips are sealed, who but I can seal the lips of those below in my secret?",
  "46520": "Did she give any reasons?",
  "46521": "And shall you dine there?",
  "46522": "What is it that's amiss?",
  "46523": "What wonder is it then?",
  "46524": "Do they not feel that if he be alloyed such power these places will be given to worse men?",
  "46525": "Nephew, will you go to court with us?",
  "46526": "And what am I to say from you?",
  "46527": "Othello was much moved with this argument, which brought the matter home to him, for if she had deceived her father, why might she not deceive her husband?",
  "46528": "Has he, indeed?",
  "46529": "How was your memory when you were eighteen, sir?",
  "46530": "And are you not horrified at the crime of which you have made yourself an accomplice?",
  "46531": "Are those who have been disappointed in their first choice, whether from the inconstancy of its object, or the perverseness of circumstances, to be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives?",
  "46532": "Do you know me?",
  "46533": "Why, then, is this prerogative of punishment, so eminently paternal, to be withheld from a paternal government?",
  "46534": "What is to be the form of government in the future?",
  "46535": "What is this decree that the smith spoke of?",
  "46536": "How is it you're not ashamed to bury such pearls in the country?",
  "46537": "Gentleman?",
  "46538": "Was it not his first duty to support his wife and children?",
  "46539": "Not more than two cables' length off?",
  "46540": "What has he brought?",
  "46541": "Have you business?",
  "46542": "How should she discern what is proper for them?",
  "46543": "But what may the like of me do that may be acceptable to a man such as you?",
  "46544": "Where are you going to sit?",
  "46545": "Irrevocably so?",
  "46546": "But the condiments are only necessary in so far as they are good for health?",
  "46547": "Is it safe to go with him then?",
  "46548": "You see that man with the drab kerseymere coat?",
  "46549": "And she lives yet?",
  "46550": "What will you do, then?",
  "46551": "And are you often found under it?",
  "46552": "You are in a hurry?",
  "46553": "Are you content?",
  "46554": "Does the morality consist in the relation of its parts to each other?",
  "46555": "And what compelled him?",
  "46556": "What are you for?",
  "46557": "Can he really have committed that crime?",
  "46558": "Do you know what I intend to do one morning?",
  "46559": "How did she look?",
  "46560": "What others?",
  "46561": "And pray, said I, walking on, how came I to be his property?",
  "46562": "Did I dream still?",
  "46563": "But was this species of acquiescence all?",
  "46564": "Well, what's wrong with him?",
  "46565": "What will the decision be?",
  "46566": "The holidays have not begun yet?",
  "46567": "Who copied this, sir?",
  "46568": "Are you satisfied with the plan?",
  "46569": "What harm is there in the letters?",
  "46570": "Nor diminish its speed?",
  "46571": "What was wrong with them?",
  "46572": "And blabbing them abroad?",
  "46573": "How is it managed?",
  "46574": "And being asked why then he had divorced his wife?",
  "46575": "And my madness?",
  "46576": "Because my children are like animals, tell me?",
  "46577": "Did you ever see us before?",
  "46578": "She was talking about it, then?",
  "46579": "But will that ever change?",
  "46580": "But how can we know that they exist in one and the same time?",
  "46581": "Will it tell us, once for all, whether it is for equality or against it?",
  "46582": "What has the villain been doing here?",
  "46583": "Would you have me put the proof bodily into your souls?",
  "46584": "Your services?",
  "46585": "Why, where be we?",
  "46586": "HOW could he look at her with those clear, warm, waiting eyes, waiting for her, even now?",
  "46587": "And had the dark and wondrous island indeed faithfully guarded its precious secret?",
  "46588": "You mean you're staying here with your uncle, like a good boy?",
  "46589": "Who made it?",
  "46590": "Those he liked?",
  "46591": "You will giva some if I like or no?",
  "46592": "Could he have formed even the vaguest idea of the suffering his absence had occasioned his friend, would not his sympathizing nature have flown immediately to my relief?",
  "46593": "Did not everything happen as I foretold?",
  "46594": "Had it gone?",
  "46595": "What precedence she shall have by her next match?",
  "46596": "What have you heard to make you think that?",
  "46597": "And financially?",
  "46598": "Refuses?",
  "46599": "And what's the father?",
  "46600": "Where in the deuce are we?",
  "46601": "Now, then, let us see?",
  "46602": "Therefore why should I be angry with a man, for loving himself better than me?",
  "46603": "And will not weakness, disorder, an undue distribution of the burdens and calamities of war, an unnecessary and intolerable increase of expense, be its natural and inevitable concomitants?",
  "46604": "See everything?",
  "46605": "Where the apothecary who, under the pretence of winding up his affairs, surrenders his drugs at their true value?",
  "46606": "Did the woman inspire you much?",
  "46607": "May I have one quiet word with him in the hall?",
  "46608": "Did you know about the garden?",
  "46609": "The girl?",
  "46610": "Hour of trial,' is rather good, what?",
  "46611": "Did you hear that said?",
  "46612": "Why did you leave it so late?",
  "46613": "I wonder if anything could have happened to him?",
  "46614": "Do you agree in this notion of the cause?",
  "46615": "Did you try her?",
  "46616": "Johann turned housemaid?",
  "46617": "What curious feeling was this coming over her?",
  "46618": "If, amid the confusion of a shipwreck, having escaped in a boat with some provisions, I see a man struggling with the waves, am I bound to go to his assistance?",
  "46619": "Have I not been there once?",
  "46620": "Where is her sin?",
  "46621": "Who gave you this packet?",
  "46622": "I'm not late?",
  "46623": "What the devil, my dear, do you think you can wear a star from heaven on your finger, and nobody observe it?",
  "46624": "And their arms?",
  "46625": "What do they want?",
  "46626": "Shall I say yes, my good friends?",
  "46627": "Where are your stout contributory kings?",
  "46628": "Who comes with the king?",

  "46639": "Your sister asked for it, I suppose?",
  "46640": "Are you not very much fatigued with the long journey you have taken, monsieur le capitaine?",
  "46641": "But can a man get a drop of the real stuff there?",
  "46642": "Do you wish me to tell you it is well drawn?",
  "46643": "Mother, where are you?",
  "46644": "And so you're really going?",
  "46645": "That's it, is it?",
  "46646": "Can I stay after you have struck me?",
  "46647": "Are they therefore, upon that account, immoral?",
  "46648": "But where is it?",
  "46649": "When can I set out again?",
  "46650": "Why should you be like anyone?",
  "46651": "Will you bet, then?",
  "46652": "And this man, the proprietor of the house, what is his name?",
  "46653": "Why, what else is there?",
  "46654": "But how and by what can we fix and determine this point of time, unless by that which already exists?",

  "46659": "What is the value of socialism?",
  "46660": "I, wretch?",
  "46661": "Did I tell you?",

  "46663": "What did I tell ye?",
  "46664": "Does she mean to prove me, or can she really not forgive me?",
  "46665": "Was it in fact true that she had nothing to give?",
  "46666": "Perhaps a cup of tea?",
  "46667": "YOU love him?",
  "46668": "What absurd name will you give him next?",

  "46682": "Why struggle?",
  "46683": "Have you formed a theory about how that bell rang?",
  "46684": "But how had I left the course of the stream?",
  "46685": "Is he much changed?",
  "46686": "For what, my friend?",
  "46687": "How long have I been here?",

  "46695": "Nothing bad, I hope?",
  "46696": "Or was he to have one more chance?",
  "46697": "Are you certain of it, sir?",
  "46698": "If not, to what cause are we to attribute the change?",
  "46699": "But about the news, your reverence?",
  "46700": "What do I think about it?",
  "46701": "Else why should they have chosen it?",
  "46702": "Was it not, then, the shout the warriors make when they wish to intimidate their enemies?",
  "46703": "But can nothing be done?",
  "46704": "Which one?",

  "46745": "What is the relief?",
  "46746": "Why in the name of decency are sisters, female intimates, or ladies and their waiting women, to be so grossly familiar as to forget the respect which one human creature owes to another?",
  "46747": "What is it, sir, that you do not understand?",

  "47002": "What's the matter with the boy?",
  "47003": "Now, was I not at liberty to show my interest in this man?",
  "47004": "Admitting this to be true of desire generally, let us suppose a particular class of desires, and out of these we will select hunger and thirst, as they are termed, which are the most obvious of them?",
  "47005": "Do you believe it yourself?",
  "47006": "May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?",
  "47007": "What baby?",
  "47008": "Do you know what I should like to do to that old horror?",
  "47009": "How do we get on?",
  "47010": "Do you think he is?",
  "47011": "In fact, what is the use of having a handsome face and a delicious costume if one does not display them?",

  "47923": "Venn?",
  "47924": "Have you ever been in love with disease and suffering, like our nurses and philanthropists?",
  "47925": "She asked you to sup with her?",
  "47926": "And is it not a palpable, unquestionable good if a peasant, or a woman with a baby, has no rest day or night and I give them rest and leisure?",
  "47927": "But how do you know he'll be there when we return?",
  "47928": "In short, was the soul returning to the body?",
  "47929": "What were the fortunes of that oldest of all old kernels?",
  "47930": "Do with you?",
  "47931": "Yes, what?",
  "47932": "Nothing to say on that, either, sir?",
  "47933": "Have I not heard her footstep on the stair ?",
  "47934": "Have you any sense at all?",
  "47935": "Will it not be pleasant to do so again?",
  "47936": "Do you understand it?",
  "47937": "An accident, I presume?",
  "47938": "Lord, who can say, monsieur?",
  "47939": "To vile reproach what answer can we make?",
  "47940": "What are they going to bring us?",
  "47941": "Will you play again?",
  "47942": "A prosperous one?",
  "47943": "How should he be strong, living as he has done?",
  "47944": "Well, what ails you?",
  "47945": "Or who standing by a large fire, feeleth not from thence a little of its heat?",
  "47946": "WHO'S going to do that?",
  "47947": "You told her I was here?",
  "47948": "Muishkin?",

  "47953": "A scientific interest, I suppose?",
  "47954": "You are not sure that he is dead, then?",
  "47955": "You will conduct us yourself, then, to that door?",
  "47956": "Come on, will you?",
  "47957": "When did he say this?",
  "47958": "How vain, if of these parents I was born?",
  "47959": "Before the angel's door?",
  "47960": "Why should we defer it?",
  "47961": "You ARE going to be married, are you not?",
  "47962": "Will you enlist?",
  "47963": "Are you speaking the truth about him now?",
  "47964": "Our tremulous lives are so different from theirs, are they not?",
  "47965": "What reason have you to be merry?",
  "47966": "Save you from what?",
  "47967": "Who arranged everything for you?",
  "47968": "And shall I let myself be bled as if I were a chamois among these innocent mountains?",
  "47969": "What are you really seeking?",
  "47970": "Bagley?",
  "47971": "What is it, dear?",
  "47972": "Will she forever summon in vain to her assistance the lance of light of the ideal?",
  "47973": "When did it strike you?",
  "47974": "Where are our bundles?",
  "47975": "And when would his name have been mentioned, but with the makers of potable gold and malleable glass?",
  "47976": "Had he played faro?",
  "47977": "Perhaps she might be here still, who knows?",
  "47978": "What if my dear husband's death might still be avenged?",
  "47979": "Any flour or grain?",
  "47980": "Who are you, in the first place, to ask me to take a turn with you?",
  "47981": "Does this man know your majesty personally?",
  "47982": "How was she dressed?",
  "47983": "What, not even the sun and moon?",
  "47984": "Barker?",
  "47985": "And, as involved in, and underlying all these questions, how ought they to be educated?",
  "47986": "Tomlinson, tell me what all that means?",
  "47987": "Does the male parade his charms with so much pomp and rivalry for no purpose?",
  "47988": "Is not the famine already come against us?",
  "47989": "And so it's she that you think so wonderful?",
  "47990": "Are you, then, so easily turned from your design?",
  "47991": "Tell me, can I hope?",
  "47992": "Mother, how could you ever put such stuff into their heads?",
  "47993": "Are the fruits gray like dust or bright like blood?",
  "47994": "Oh, you mean the thing?",
  "47995": "What is there impossible in what I propose?",
  "47996": "But suppose you have made some error?",
  "47997": "Got it with you?",
  "47998": "Will you take some?",
  "47999": "By whom will Z be paid?",
  "48000": "Was it pleasant?",
  "48001": "Would he not at least have gone down to his death fighting heroically to the last?",
  "48002": "Shall I tell madame that monsieur will be here shortly?",
  "48003": "Had she been faithless to the earth?",
  "48004": "Did you take it?",
  "48005": "Who brought her father to life?",
  "48006": "This, then, is the friendly service which you swore to me?",
  "48007": "I wonder what her fate will be?",
  "48008": "What doth this gold profit us?",
  "48009": "What an innocent mutton, hey?",
  "48010": "Had she not accused the queen of having meetings by night with the earl in the deserted tower?",
  "48011": "What about the money?",
  "48012": "Is there, has there ever been, any question that by the law of war, property, both of enemies and friends, may be taken when needed?",
  "48013": "Kennedy?",
  "48014": "Despotic, passionate, ready for any violence as he was, what was he meditating, what had he made up his mind to do?",
  "48015": "Does he still write on his back?",
  "48016": "You must agree with me?",
  "48017": "Why have you not told me what to do?",
  "48018": "How shews it by night?",
  "48019": "Would he do her any hurt?",
  "48020": "Should not he be scalded first?",
  "48021": "Would you say that knowledge is a faculty, or in what class would you place it?",
  "48022": "What in the world are you doing here?",
  "48023": "Is that which may be so applied given to help the poor, who cannot pay for education, or does it virtually subsidise the comparatively rich, who can?",
  "48024": "Do you want me to be your best man?",
  "48025": "But know you who he was?",
  "48026": "Shall we go home, my father?",
  "48027": "Well, what does that mean?",
  "48028": "And what did you do with the child?",
  "48029": "Or pot to hold your ink?",
  "48030": "Create national workshops, assure a minimum to unemployed workmen, and assign to employees a share of the profits?",
  "48031": "By the king?",
  "48032": "How is one of us to help hisself against having on 'em?",
  "48033": "Did you venture so far?",
  "48034": "By looking like fools?",
  "48035": "What is the score?",
  "48036": "In the place of your laws of monopoly, the limits of whose circle your imagination is powerless to overstep?",
  "48037": "What is this rule, this measure, this criterion of progress, the violation of which is the perpetual cause of poverty?",
  "48038": "The whole nine?",
  "48039": "How much are they?",
  "48040": "Why, what in the nation do you mean?",
  "48041": "What SHALL I do, grandmother?",
  "48042": "Shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?",
  "48043": "Has my dream come true?",
  "48044": "Before a siege?",
  "48045": "What then can we look for from this confusion of groundless and extraordinary opinions but error and falshood?",
  "48046": "What, dollars?",
  "48047": "What did she care?",
  "48048": "How could he?",
  "48049": "Who is it that I hear?",
  "48050": "What are you afraid of?",
  "48051": "Where, when, and how was it built?",
  "48052": "Why are you shuddering?",
  "48053": "And what is the next question?",
  "48054": "Wherefore so?",
  "48055": "Suppose the man says to me seven and sixpence?",
  "48056": "What made you deceive me so?",
  "48057": "Express the object or purpose of so doing?",
  "48058": "Nay, what was the thing in which we knead our flour?",
  "48059": "An dust and clay and flowers of the field?",
  "48060": "Would you be so good?",
  "48061": "Where are the others?",
  "48062": "I suppose you are agreeable to that, old gentleman?",
  "48063": "Have you any meat?",
  "48064": "Shall we keep on long in this way?",
  "48065": "Was he going to throw her down?",
  "48066": "How's a poor man to live that way?",
  "48067": "Did she place it on her head?",
  "48068": "This is clear enough, I suppose?",
  "48069": "What is that you have in your hand?",
  "48070": "Is it necessary, that the peasants should work to the very limits of their strength and never have sufficient to eat while we are living in the greatest luxury?",
  "48071": "And your companions?",
  "48072": "I am to be a soldier then?",
  "48073": "Well, why not?",
  "48074": "Do you believe he will come?",
  "48075": "And his body?",
  "48076": "How old do you think she is?",
  "48077": "But what are we to do with it?",
  "48078": "Natasha, you love me?",
  "48079": "Who recommended you to come here?",
  "48080": "Strange, is it not, that the thunder birds flap so heavily along the west at that moment and a peal of laughter sounds from the lake?",
  "48081": "Is it a secret, sir?",
  "48082": "Well, what do you want us to do?",
  "48083": "Bounds, my dear?",
  "48084": "What the hell is it to you who are my friends?",
  "48085": "What you said, is it?",
  "48086": "He wants words?",
  "48087": "There has been some new development?",
  "48088": "And now amid these things what shall I say?",
  "48089": "Can you tell what we may have to go through yet?",
  "48090": "How, then, am I going to stop him?",
  "48091": "How lost you your name, my most kind virgin?",
  "48092": "Who is to lead, and who to follow?",
  "48093": "Has that infernal dog torn up those geraniums again?",
  "48094": "And our guardian is both warrior and philosopher?",
  "48095": "Well, did you grieve very much for her?",
  "48096": "Are you kidding?",
  "48097": "And what did you do meantime?",
  "48098": "What's that on the arm of the chair, a fur cloak or some beast?",
  "48099": "Now, what can you do?",
  "48100": "You will go down slow, sir, I suppose?",
  "48101": "Whuzzat you say?",
  "48102": "Will you come again and help me to do it?",
  "48103": "What is the debt?",
  "48104": "And shall I nail down the lid, sir?",
  "48105": "Do you wish for a notary?",
  "48106": "What was it she bore in her arms, the little bundle that she held tight to her breast to shield it from the falling snow?",
  "48107": "What is the use of trying any more?",
  "48108": "Have you found them?",
  "48109": "Ca vous amuse, la vie?",
  "48110": "Would you kindly wait?",
  "48111": "Which would you have?",
  "48112": "How did the burglar know no one would hear it?",
  "48113": "Can you desire that I should ever find reason to regret the favorable opinion of the senate?",
  "48114": "Do you use whistles in your country?",
  "48115": "What, and scaped?",
  "48116": "Really?",
  "48117": "Of what family is he, and where is his estate?",
  "48118": "Why should I mind?",
  "48119": "You with a pleasant home?",
  "48120": "All alone?",
  "48121": "And have they keys of the grating?",
  "48122": "And should I always be sitting with you?",
  "48123": "If I do, will you grant me common sense, then, for the future?",
  "48124": "Why, once you are rid of them, should you pester criminals to respect an uncongenial standard of conduct?",
  "48125": "And what is it we are watching for?",
  "48126": "Cannibals?",
  "48127": "On what then are you to live?",
  "48128": "What should he have to mind?",
  "48129": "And whom are you yours from, mamma?",
  "48130": "You are wounded?",
  "48131": "Perhaps he would not see her any more?",
  "48132": "Do you complain of that?",
  "48133": "Who has told them not to capture me these twenty times over?",
  "48134": "What is the cause of this exclusion?",
  "48135": "But how came you in the bag?",
  "48136": "Let us hide him away, and who is the wiser?",
  "48137": "How acts the judge?",
  "48138": "And you'll go?",
  "48139": "Have you any ideas?",
  "48140": "You heard?",
  "48141": "What's to be the wonder now?",
  "48142": "But was he himself convinced of the accuracy of this explanation?",
  "48143": "Did you lose some of your teeth, the reason your voice sounds so funny?",
  "48144": "Hang it, what's that?",
  "48145": "How like you them, signior?",
  "48146": "What has she been saying to you?",
  "48147": "Why should he take all this trouble?",
  "48148": "Can you manage that?",
  "48149": "What payment?",
  "48150": "Till what?",
  "48151": "Or, if obtained, what can it amount to, but new disgraces, contentions and quarrels?",
  "48152": "I, sir?",
  "48153": "Is not general incivility the very essence of love?",
  "48154": "You persist, then?",
  "48155": "What is this story?",
  "48156": "So we're as we were?",
  "48157": "Do you still see as much of him as ever?",
  "48158": "Who would have ever believed it?",
  "48159": "Forever?",
  "48160": "You are happy, my dear father?",
  "48161": "Can I spare the time to walk with you, sir?",
  "48162": "You know, I suppose, who I married?",
  "48163": "Must not people take their chances in this world?",
  "48164": "Where were you, then?",
  "48165": "Is there life in the moon?",
  "48166": "How is that?",
  "48167": "What's his game in the matter?",
  "48168": "And why should the entire nation be thrown into the perilous convulsions of a revolution more truly formidable than any yet attempted on earth?",
  "48169": "But what had it to do with the crime?",
  "48170": "Well, if you did?",
  "48171": "And you said nothing?",
  "48172": "Well, are you ready?",
  "48173": "Can you get near enough to throw shells into the city?",
  "48174": "How could they then prevent the pirates from landing?",
  "48175": "Shall we expect some transatlantic military giant to step the ocean and crush us at a blow?",
  "48176": "Do you call it a cheerful language, now?",
  "48177": "Some poetry?",
  "48178": "Was it possible for me to expect in a lady of such high rank, a constancy proof against my want of address to support it?",
  "48179": "How do you account for what my father saw and heard there?",
  "48180": "Do you come a long way from here?",
  "48181": "You have a message for me?",
  "48182": "Where, sire?",
  "48183": "What do you mean by wrong?",
  "48184": "Has he not thrice refused?",
  "48185": "O, whither shall I flee?",
  "48186": "But what did that amount to?",
  "48187": "Can you produce him?",
  "48188": "What's amiss now, eh?",
  "48189": "If I am here at six it will do, I suppose?",
  "48190": "What else do we need?",
  "48191": "But shall I put my foot on his neck, I, of all men, when he is falling a prey to the intrigues of a pack of women and clerks?",
  "48192": "That surprises you, does it?",
  "48193": "If there be no life similar to ours in animals, how could we sustain our life by subsisting on them?",
  "48194": "Could this be a desirable condition for a young country to be in?",
  "48195": "How, then, could the attractiveness of labor serve us as a principle and lever, when it is still our object and our end?",
  "48196": "Finished with your uncle?",
  "48197": "Do the pale faces love their children less in the morning than at night?",
  "48198": "Were his companions dead with him?",
  "48199": "Boots, clothes, bread?",
  "48200": "In all candor let me ask, was such a system for benefiting the few at the expense of the many ever before devised?",
  "48201": "Would they perceive peoples, herds of lunar animals, towns, lakes, seas?",
  "48202": "Ha?",
  "48203": "And for what do you take us, then?",
  "48204": "And the nose?",
  "48205": "And WHO is it that must come some day?",
  "48206": "I wonder what'll become of MY name when I go in?",
  "48207": "What happened to the roses?",
  "48208": "And you knew how to make that calculation?",
  "48209": "Now, what should she give it him for?",
  "48210": "Have you got a sore throat?",
  "48211": "Are you settisfawd nah?",
  "48212": "Let me reason with the supporters of this opinion, who have any knowledge of human nature, do they imagine that marriage can eradicate the habitude of life?",
  "48213": "And what are you blushing for again?",
  "48214": "What's going on?",
  "48215": "Shall we go?",
  "48216": "But under such circumstances, what could one do?",
  "48217": "And can he ever join his father in punishing me?",
  "48218": "What is the bond of corporations?",
  "48219": "Is there anything I can order for you?",
  "48220": "Oh do you?",
  "48221": "Have you never said a word on the matter?",
  "48222": "I understand that they have had brokers in the house?",
  "48223": "You may remember me?",
  "48224": "What powerful motives did I not call to my mind to stifle it?",
  "48225": "Well, what are you waiting for?",
  "48226": "What are you doing, pray, you fellow on the roof?",
  "48227": "There, truly, he is coming?",
  "48228": "Pray has this girl been found?",
  "48229": "Pressed by such arguments as these, what could a weak man do but yield?",

  "48234": "Can I send any more?",
  "48235": "What is the object of medical education?",
  "48236": "He's not going to die at once, I should think, is he?",
  "48237": "Mary, you heard that?",
  "48238": "But do you know in what manner I will make amends for my faults during the short space of time I have to remain near to you?",
  "48239": "What have you to say against him?",
  "48240": "Who still wanteth to obey?",
  "48241": "Is it part of the mast of the MACQUARIE?",
  "48242": "Who let you in?",
  "48243": "Knew no more about the lists?",
  "48244": "Is that the way?",
  "48245": "What, then, is the reason of this preference generally accorded to the metals for the purpose of money, and how shall we explain this speciality of function, unparalleled in political economy, possessed by specie?",
  "48246": "Then what do I recommend?",
  "48247": "Who can have authorized such an institution?",
  "48248": "Not the drains, I hope?",
  "48249": "What have you done with your candle?",
  "48250": "Yes, but what is a girl to do who has no family?",
  "48251": "Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of it?",
  "48252": "Ever since I come here, you've been out of your senses, and what would have been the good of telling you then?",
  "48253": "And you receive silver from that man?",
  "48254": "Shall I say imprisonment?",
  "48255": "Does it indeed?",
  "48256": "In other terms, is it not the absolute, of which we are only the relative?",
  "48257": "Look, comes he not?",
  "48258": "What is there new in this?",
  "48259": "What will you do with him, madame?",
  "48260": "How can it be lawful that this youth should live for a single hour?",
  "48261": "Where was the eye of your father this day, that it might have seen you?",
  "48262": "But why come to any road?",
  "48263": "Is she beautiful?",
  "48264": "Will you not carry that monster away?",

  "48266": "Pray let me know who you really are?",
  "48267": "Can I have a few minutes' talk with you?",
  "48268": "I beg your pardon, ma'am?",
  "48269": "Or the seventh sons of seventh sons?",
  "48270": "And has he found consolation?",
  "48271": "What angel is that I see?",
  "48272": "Is she resurrected?",
  "48273": "Have YOU been making that horrible noise?",
  "48274": "And may I know whose voice mine so closely resembles?",
  "48275": "What could this man, who was reproved, say to that woman, who was dead?",
  "48276": "Can you see?",
  "48277": "Have you brought information about the scoundrels as cut my trees?",
  "48278": "Jervoise, what do you say?",
  "48279": "But all this time on foot?",
  "48280": "Do you hear, baron?",
  "48281": "Why do you?",
  "48282": "How did you get me out?",
  "48283": "Ah, what else is there?",
  "48284": "Ah, poor wretch, when was your lip pressed before by such pure kisses?",
  "48285": "Besides, how should a woman void of reflection be capable of educating her children?",
  "48286": "How's the game?",
  "48287": "Whether I was at all in danger of being hanged?",
  "48288": "What did you answer him?",
  "48289": "So you intend then to remain with me whether I like it or no?",
  "48290": "Why does it cry and resist before it is hurt?",
  "48291": "To whom do all these fine clothes and moccasins belong?",
  "48292": "And would you marry a woman like that, now?",
  "48293": "Sore?",
  "48294": "Might I not myself be mistaken?",
  "48295": "How could we know it?",
  "48296": "Who will affirm that I intended to take possession of this ship and deliver it into the hands of the convicts?",
  "48297": "Do you hear this, signior?",
  "48298": "This, then, is the slab?",
  "48299": "Do you know of one who is weary?",
  "48300": "And who suspects me, and of what?",
  "48301": "Would that be respectful like, from me to you, squire?",
  "48302": "Well, what are you smiling at?",
  "48303": "Why do we not destroy them entirely, and use their cattle and grazing lands at our pleasure?",
  "48304": "When I do not know whether death is a good or an evil, why should I propose a penalty which would certainly be an evil?",
  "48305": "What then did you give as your reason for refusing him?",
  "48306": "Was I mad, or drunk, or dreaming, or was I merely the victim of a gigantic and most elaborate hoax?",
  "48307": "How have I deserved that you, the powerful and universally dreaded favorite of the king, should dedicate yourself to my service?",
  "48308": "A state?",
  "48309": "Why do you, every time you take a step, go like this?",
  "48310": "Why do I not take my life?",

  "49114": "All set?",
  "49115": "Do you swear that to me?",
  "49116": "Should the aim of punishment be the reformation of the criminal?",
  "49117": "And will these save our lives?",
  "49118": "Is that question in the interests of science too?",
  "49119": "Eh, my pretty?",
  "49120": "Is not this true?",
  "49121": "But what has happened?",
  "49122": "What at our hands demand ye?",
  "49123": "What could either do, that I cannot?",
  "49124": "What therefore do you pretend to?",
  "49125": "But those who brought you up?",
  "49126": "Then it must be an ellipse?",
  "49127": "Have we taken alive an inhabitant of the seas of primitive ages?",
  "49128": "Then, why not come away with me?",
  "49129": "Where did he live?",
  "49130": "Or is this pretty artifice contrived, to signify that here the chase must end, and my pursuit be crowned, for you can fly no further?",
  "49131": "Why has so violent a movement been followed by so long a repose?",
  "49132": "A lover?",
  "49133": "Has he not also another object, which is that they may be impoverished by payment of taxes, and thus compelled to devote themselves to their daily wants and therefore less likely to conspire against him?",
  "49134": "What's wrang?",
  "49135": "Can they have finished ploughing?",
  "49136": "Is there any one forgotten thing afore we parts?",
  "49137": "But surely one can do that sometimes?",
  "49138": "Sylvestre?",
  "49139": "And why should your majesty suspect me of dissimulation, I ask?",
  "49140": "Has something special happened?",
  "49141": "Why not try and please us this time?",
  "49142": "How could you behave so unfairly by your sister?",
  "49143": "Am I to believe there's anything real in what you say?",
  "49144": "That's all?",
  "49145": "Why did you suffer him to live?",
  "49146": "Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends?",
  "49147": "Speaking with this love of your own then, have you undertaken to convey to me that you believe your husband and your father's wife to be in act and in fact lovers of each other?",
  "49148": "Would you like to inhale it for a second?",
  "49149": "Is he not prorsus inutilis ad thorum?",
  "49150": "Do you mean that there is no such maker or creator, or that in one sense there might be a maker of all these things but in another not?",
  "49151": "Well, little girl, what is it?",
  "49152": "Do not you feel a certain vibration of the soil?",
  "49153": "What is that machine?",
  "49154": "Had he reached the point where he could no longer recognize the reef, could no longer divine the snare, no longer discern the crumbling brink of abysses?",
  "49155": "Are you quite sure?",
  "49156": "You were going to say?",
  "49157": "Where did these things take place?",
  "49158": "What did you say?",
  "49159": "And what would he say to the dragon's cousin the serjeant, if the serjeant should be brought upon the field before he was able to escape from it?",
  "49160": "How do you know where to go to?",
  "49161": "To you and myself?",
  "49162": "Now what does this mean?",
  "49163": "What does it matter to you now, in any case?",
  "49164": "Our father?",
  "49165": "Children, who'd like to race the horses with me?",
  "49166": "Never mind, never mind, what does it matter?",
  "49167": "What o'clock was this?",
  "49168": "And would you just throw in a nod when I seem to ask you for it?",
  "49169": "What was he to say?",
  "49170": "And what is your success?",
  "49171": "That's a most puzzling expression for a natural science man, do you understand?",
  "49172": "Was he not made?",
  "49173": "Would an exchange of name be an exchange of rights?",
  "49174": "And have we, any on us, yet come so low as he come?",
  "49175": "At the same place?",
  "49176": "Have you no longer any kind feeling for your father?",
  "49177": "Out, even to me?",
  "49178": "Do you know?",
  "49179": "The tide?",
  "49180": "Did you receive my little note the day before yesterday?",
  "49181": "What sort of a report would they bring of the result?",
  "49182": "And what are you jawing for like that?",
  "49183": "What did you see?",
  "49184": "Going to see the pictures?",
  "49185": "But who should be the executioner?",
  "49186": "And what was that working?",
  "49187": "What are you going to do about him?",
  "49188": "You are not worse, are you?",
  "49189": "Why not go right down now and fix him?",
  "49190": "You may have recognized the fumes?",
  "49191": "Oh, what does that matter?",
  "49192": "From whom did you get this?",
  "49193": "Who do you reckon 't is?",
  "49194": "Why did he not break it there, since it is evident that every yard that he carried it increased the risk of someone meeting him?",
  "49195": "Which I took hold of and was merrily asking him what he would take to have it said for my honour that it was of my getting?",
  "49196": "How did it come to be cut like that?",
  "49197": "On the hypothesis of the essential goodness of man, how then is to be explained the monstrous attempt to change the authority of some into nobility and the obedience of others into plebeianism?",
  "49198": "Why do you trample upon dead bodies in this temple?",
  "49199": "And how did it happen?",
  "49200": "What do you consider to be the greatest blessing which you have reaped from your wealth?",
  "49201": "Where got she the strength to resist the impulse?",
  "49202": "Anything I like?",
  "49203": "Micawber?",
  "49204": "Are you a large party?",
  "49205": "What were our feelings at that moment?",
  "49206": "Where are you running to?",
  "49207": "A document?",
  "49208": "Do you not reckon me?",
  "49209": "MATERIALS?",
  "49210": "Will any antiquarian inform us, if possible, why these bones were placed here?",
  "49211": "And what do you call these, my darling?",
  "49212": "As to you, monseigneur?",
  "49213": "And had he any right to ask her for a revelation of feelings which she had evidently intended to withhold from him?",
  "49214": "Which of the three is it?",
  "49215": "What do I say?",
  "49216": "And you heard what he said?",
  "49217": "Will you give them to me?",
  "49218": "Well, and what have you been doing?",
  "49219": "Why are there no daffodils now?",
  "49220": "Is it not a happy feeling?",
  "49221": "Why sacrifice forty?",
  "49222": "Where's that ten cents?",
  "49223": "And if he left off dreaming about you, where do you suppose you'd be?",
  "49224": "With your brother?",
  "49225": "Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy?",
  "49226": "Now, dear, what are your own?",
  "49227": "I suffer from emotion?",
  "49228": "What laws are there for us?",
  "49229": "And shall she have the head she covets?",
  "49230": "Would she go out to work again?",
  "49231": "Where did I disappear to?",
  "49232": "And you have no way to get news of them?",
  "49233": "Again the law?",
  "49234": "Aunt, will you have some beef?",
  "49235": "Saw her?",
  "49236": "Shall we get out and try to find the road?",
  "49237": "You found something compromising?",
  "49238": "Do you see this letter?",
  "49239": "The gentleman who receives us?",
  "49240": "Has my father asked you for money?",
  "49241": "Who are you, that you should question the judgment of the nations and the ages?",
  "49242": "What would they do in that case?",
  "49243": "You have not counted me out as equal to so much land, and calculated on me as a balance at your banker's?",
  "49244": "Do you know what this plant is?",
  "49245": "Was he awake, or was it but a dream?",
  "49246": "I wonder where we can go next?",
  "49247": "Are you thinking, if I'm drunk itself, I'd leave my daughter living single with a little frisky rascal is the like of you?",
  "49248": "And what awaits you if you remain faithful to your oath, and obey the commands given you?",
  "49249": "Sire, have you in the army one regiment on which you can implicitly rely?",
  "49250": "Will it take long?",
  "49251": "What's that pump stopping for?",
  "49252": "But then, why do you repulse me?",
  "49253": "Are you willing?",
  "49254": "Have I any?",
  "49255": "I wish you'd lend me half a sovereign, will you?",
  "49256": "No, really?",
  "49257": "Has he left you for another?",
  "49258": "Can we really affect the adversary's will?",
  "49259": "Shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the sea?",
  "49260": "Would you say that these, or any similar impertinences which private individuals are supposed to address to their rulers, whether in verse or prose, are well or ill spoken?",
  "49261": "Was it possible for her to forgive him?",
  "49262": "How did late continuators, familiar with the serpents, lions, bulls' heads, crabs, doves, and so forth, on the contemporary shields, keep such picturesque and attractive details out of their new rhapsodies?",
  "49263": "D'you like all that frilly, bunchy stuff at the throat?",
  "49264": "What purpose do they serve?",
  "49265": "Oh is it?",
  "49266": "Were all those dear, sorrowful, valiant, charming or tragic beings merely dreams?",
  "49267": "Is there anything of the feminine gender among them?",
  "49268": "Lodging?",
  "49269": "Not his brother?",
  "49270": "And which of them made this passage?",
  "49271": "Not more?",
  "49272": "Has he been examined by any synod or council?",
  "49273": "Have you any objection to see him in my presence?",
  "49274": "But what about them at home?",
  "49275": "What is the difference between light and the lustre which is seen on the polished surface of opaque bodies?",
  "49276": "Now, ma'am, am I a fool?",
  "49277": "You know who that is?",
  "49278": "Had she left no friends, no relations behind her?",
  "49279": "What are you doing?",
  "49280": "You'll take me as I am, with nothing?",
  "49281": "Things are all right with you then?",
  "49282": "Ought he to turn to the left or to the right?",
  "49283": "Who dares?",
  "49284": "But how did you manage it, little pa?",
  "49285": "Some what?",
  "49286": "Do you give it to me?",
  "49287": "Tell me, are you human, or are you more than human?",
  "49288": "And you have not made her speak?",
  "49289": "Took hold of you?",
  "49290": "Have you not talked long enough to drink?",
  "49291": "How can you be so cruel to me?",
  "49292": "Are you better?",
  "49293": "Who is it that you have fallen in love with, my poor fellow?",
  "49294": "Come, come, who did you think we were when you ran away from us?",
  "49295": "But what do you require of me, then?",
  "49296": "Do you like roses?",
  "49297": "Not just yet?",
  "49298": "Was there ever a loser content with the loss of the game?",
  "49299": "Going?",
  "49300": "What's the colour of their stockings?",
  "49301": "Why do you look at us like that?",
  "49302": "Does his daughter know of the relapse?",
  "49303": "Is it not a pity that people who are bright and clever should so often be exceedingly improper?",
  "49304": "What did it all mean?",
  "49305": "Would you like a little mash?",
  "49306": "And what salary do you ask?",
  "49307": "I s'pose you'll be starting off for college in a fortnight's time?",
  "49308": "But, can they be expected to inspire independent sentiments, whose conduct must be regulated by the cautious prudence that is ever on the watch for preferment?",
  "49309": "Did you see a young lad passing this way in the early morning or the fall of night?",
  "49310": "How can you say so?",
  "49311": "Could inertia of race, on such a scale, be broken up, or take new form?",
  "49312": "And how did he treat you?",
  "49313": "You, dear mamma?",
  "49314": "What line shall you take, then?",
  "49315": "Towards a new sun?",
  "49316": "May I come in, guardian?",
  "49317": "Has he finished his turn?",
  "49318": "Mahotin?",
  "49319": "Yet why did he come?",
  "49320": "Is it as bad as all that?",
  "49321": "How old are you and what's your name?",
  "49322": "Are the others coming out?",
  "49323": "Are you certain that you can afford to part with so much money, and that it is right that it should be so expended?",
  "49324": "Was that last night?",
  "49325": "Is my pa in, do you know?",
  "49326": "Is that all?",
  "49327": "Was this ever possible?",
  "49328": "Their hair?",
  "49329": "Did they leave these two industries to themselves?",
  "49330": "Do they by attaching to the soul and inhering in her at last bring her to death, and so separate her from the body ?",
  "49331": "Have you been slightly dazzled at the sudden fusion of my ingots?",
  "49332": "Perhaps you did not like it?",
  "49333": "Did he look in this way?",
  "49334": "To me?",
  "49335": "But, look here, are you a great hand with the ladies?",
  "49336": "Have you?",
  "49337": "Was he a man or only a crosseyed thief an a loafer?",
  "49338": "Is that all the story?",
  "49339": "None of it at all?",
  "49340": "And how do you find home, now you have come back to it?",
  "49341": "Do you suppose you could find any good in a child by whipping him?",
  "49342": "Is it the secret instinct of decaying nature, or the soul's impulsive throb, as immortality draws on?",
  "49343": "Who was the youth he had adopted and who bore so striking a resemblance to him?",
  "49344": "And his offence?",
  "49345": "Are you sure you are not making a mistake?",
  "49346": "You mean your papers?",
  "49347": "It is a poor conclusion, is it not?",
  "49348": "It may also be called temperate, and for the same reasons?",
  "49349": "But surely this is somewhat irrelevant?",
  "49350": "Was it very vile to be dragged back here again?",
  "49351": "Can you break an engagement off slowly?",
  "49352": "Do you wish to ruin us outright?",
  "49353": "Any how does she do?",
  "49354": "Neckett's children?",
  "49355": "Safe?",
  "49356": "My friends, why do I wish for peace?",
  "49357": "Can he speak?",
  "49358": "And why not with you?",
  "49359": "Well, do you like it?",
  "49360": "What was she to do?",
  "49361": "But can you make any sense out of them?",
  "49362": "He was not playing, then?",
  "49363": "Rosamond a sufferer, a labourer, a female apostle?",
  "49364": "Who could grant them?",
  "49365": "What were you saying about being married?",
  "49366": "Was he engaged in a struggle with some animal whose retreat he had disturbed?",
  "49367": "Did he sign, too?",
  "49368": "You're not angry with me any more?",
  "49369": "How long will this fuse burn?",
  "49370": "Why do you hesitate?",
  "49371": "How can I ever describe the charm and picturesqueness of that summer life?",
  "49372": "May I write to you?",
  "49373": "This will be your luggage, I suppose?",
  "49374": "How could that bring you?",
  "49375": "But all our praises why should lords engross?",
  "49376": "And what then would you say?",
  "49377": "What is your opinion on the matter?",
  "49378": "Pictures are like wine, and want age, you think?",
  "49379": "Where is the entrance?",
  "49380": "The barricade?",
  "49381": "What is life at all?",
  "49382": "If you please, sir, should I have no brandy nor nothing to give the poor creetur?",
  "49383": "Is he kind to her?",
  "49384": "Who is conducting the prosecution?",
  "49385": "Is it mingled with anger or hate?",
  "49386": "What had he to do, indeed?",
  "49387": "Why, what, madam, does it signify what I think?",
  "49388": "Will it be believed that the night of so brilliant a day was for me a night of anguish and perplexity?",
  "49389": "Is not this an agreeable surprise?",
  "49390": "What can you not understand?",
  "49391": "Yes, but where?",
  "49392": "What did you burn 'em for?",
  "49393": "But you, messieurs, you whom I think it an honor to call my friends, since you have been willing to accept that title, what will become of you in the meantime?",
  "49394": "But what does that signify?",
  "49395": "Has it indeed?",
  "49396": "What do you want, sir?",
  "49397": "How did that help you?",
  "49398": "Let me hear it?",
  "49399": "But then again, what has the whale to say?",
  "49400": "What power?",
  "49401": "Surely he has some opinion?",
  "49402": "Will it be soon?",
  "49403": "Must I, then?",
  "49404": "Do you call that nourishment?",
  "49405": "What WERE these things?",
  "49406": "Polo?",
  "49407": "Does he like the moor?",
  "49408": "What, dares the villain write in such base terms?",
  "49409": "But what can I do?",
  "49410": "You are quite sure?",
  "49411": "Publish what, you unreasonable man?",
  "49412": "And where do you come from?",
  "49413": "What letter do you mean she returned unopened?",
  "49414": "Why should I not stay here?",
  "49415": "Has any modern state as yet succeeded in incorporating in its civil constitution such provisions as will ensure to all classes of its subjects any considerable share in the common good?",
  "49416": "You insist?",
  "49417": "What's the motive?",
  "49418": "Could he not hinder that, by persuading her out of her system of privation?",
  "49419": "Well, mon cher, what are you doing personally?",
  "49420": "What did he know of himself?",
  "49421": "What is the young lady's name?",
  "49422": "Shall I adventure?",
  "49423": "Is that his child?",
  "49424": "Then, sire?",
  "49425": "Object to in them?",
  "49426": "Have you any thing further?",
  "49427": "Why, what do they want with more?",
  "49428": "You would wish a notary to be sent for then?",
  "49429": "Is HE her uncle?",
  "49430": "And is it really so beautiful as they say?",
  "49431": "Do you not see?",
  "49432": "Look?",
  "49433": "Do you understand, officer?",
  "49434": "From your husband?",
  "49435": "And who are you to teach me?",
  "49436": "You went home?",
  "49437": "Is not that stonework?",
  "49438": "You order me to receive his friends, too, I suppose?",
  "49439": "Have you any?",
  "49440": "Why should I stay here alone?",
  "49441": "Is my lord pleased with his escort?",
  "49442": "Who will lead us through the land?",
  "49443": "Is it a holiday?",
  "49444": "But where did he find it?",
  "49445": "Then I am not like him, am I?",
  "49446": "Have I a friend here?",
  "49447": "On an omnibus?",
  "49448": "And for what reason?",
  "49449": "And in our opinion the guardians ought to have both these qualities?",
  "49450": "What have they done to my hair?",
  "49451": "Have you ever slept, my friend, in a grove of orange trees in flower?",
  "49452": "But for air to breathe on the road?",
  "49453": "Is not some idea expressed in the act of exhuming the bones after the flesh is decayed ?",
  "49454": "Can I wipe my face now?",
  "49455": "In a game of tennis?",
  "49456": "With what will you save it?",
  "49457": "Cousin, what's the matter?",
  "49458": "May we talk?",
  "49459": "Will you be improved?",
  "49460": "Are you rich, that you may pay for courtiers?",
  "49461": "And has not her own avarice been sufficiently punished by the ruin of her own hopes and the loss of the property by which she set so much store?",
  "49462": "Why do you not go back?",
  "49463": "But tell me all about it?",
  "49464": "And why do you mean to do such a horrible thing?",
  "49465": "What do YOU think of what the prince has just been saying?",
  "49466": "What need you fear?",
  "49467": "You say you fear nothing but death?",
  "49468": "Who would believe, that a childish fault should be productive of such melancholy consequences?",
  "49469": "And my sisters?",
  "49470": "Could the diplomat hold it?",
  "49471": "Would you, therefore, that your physician heal the bodily evil?",
  "49472": "Will you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine wanderer?",
  "49473": "Had something gone wrong with the bank?",
  "49474": "Suppose, for instance, that he should be imprisoned for two months, should he be allowed to return to his living at the expiration of that term?",
  "49475": "What was this universe?",
  "49476": "What million?",
  "49477": "Will you then, in the presence of these two friends, accept me as your future husband, and plight me your vow of truth and love?",
  "49478": "Why are we to love prejudices, merely because they are prejudices?",
  "49479": "D'you remember what you said to me the other day?",
  "49480": "And did he take it?",
  "49481": "Did you ever see a crocodile overcome?",
  "49482": "Did you see the nursing home!?",
  "49483": "My friend deceive me?",
  "49484": "Well, my dear, what is it?",
  "49485": "Would you fear to go, perhaps to your death, for this imperilled man?",
  "49486": "Must I go?",
  "49487": "Why speak, when words cannot express what one feels?",
  "49488": "Who is to prevent me?",
  "49489": "Of what was he in pursuit?",
  "49490": "Can you not recognize something undisturbed and peaceful among disturbance and trouble?",
  "49491": "And you, my lord?",
  "49492": "What was behind their competent stare?",
  "49493": "And how did this despatch reach you?",
  "49494": "But how were they to be got at?",
  "49495": "What should I speak to him for?",
  "49496": "Tabooed?",
  "49497": "Not?",
  "49498": "Nor running a chance of arrest?",
  "49499": "Who said I wanted to?",
  "49500": "Impossible?",
  "49501": "But wherefore do I awake this remembrance?",
  "49502": "But why are you going?",
  "49503": "To the left?",
  "49504": "How can it be that he should think otherwise?",
  "49505": "What drives him to it?",
  "49506": "How in the name of reason can I be asked to eat a mutton chop?",
  "49507": "Who knows whether these opacities will not become transparent?",
  "49508": "Eh, what?",
  "49509": "What on earth are you raving about?",
  "49510": "What is it but the worst and last form of intellectualism, this love of yours for passion and the animal instincts?",
  "49511": "But what do you mean?",
  "49512": "With this conviction, would he have left the head apothecary in that town?",
  "49513": "Theatres, evening parties, dinners in town?",
  "49514": "What atonement shall we offer him?",
  "49515": "Does HE suppose that people will pay him only to come and sit with them and go away again?",
  "49516": "What have you got?",
  "49517": "Are you coming up there now?",
  "49518": "Have you seen 'em lately?",
  "49519": "How should this same new wisdom be started up and established?",
  "49520": "What are you, and what may your business in this house be?",
  "49521": "Do these belong to the cardinal?",
  "49522": "So that's angel number one?",
  "49523": "Then it's all right?",
  "49524": "Who are you, my lad?",
  "49525": "Baisemeaux?",
  "49526": "What month did we meet him?",
  "49527": "How about the cross?",
  "49528": "In these circumstances what was more natural than that some should advocate a return to the classics and all that the classics enshrined?",
  "49529": "What did they call the wretched being?",
  "49530": "Did he not make speeches in the lobby to show how villainous that decision was, and how it ought to be overthrown?",
  "49531": "When do you go back again?",
  "49532": "What say they?",
  "49533": "Say summat?",
  "49534": "But what is there in common between these rude outlines of instinctive organization and the true social science?",
  "49535": "I wish to soothe him, yet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of every hope of consolation, to live?",
  "49536": "Slight, what moved you to be thus impertinent?",
  "49537": "Or from the fact that I have escaped, that I have completely fled, that I am finally free again and am standing like a child under the sky?",
  "49538": "What does he wish you to do?",
  "49539": "How shall I ever thank you?",
  "49540": "Could she be happy with this jungle waif?",
  "49541": "Had he, in lending to this stranger the aid of his key, and in making some other man than himself emerge from that portal, the pure and disinterested intention of rescuing an assassin?",
  "49542": "You must wait for what?",
  "49543": "Then she is dead?",
  "49544": "But when are you free?",
  "49545": "How could such a collection be here, where you see everything except the inside of one little cupboard and a few boxes?",
  "49546": "What's your business in this apartment?",
  "49547": "Who can calculate the depth of affection expressed in that enthusiastic SO?",
  "49548": "Their eyes?",
  "49549": "Was not that everything?",
  "49550": "Dirty?",
  "49551": "Raissa, dear, what's the matter with you?",
  "49552": "What consequence is that to me?",
  "49553": "Is she your mistress?",
  "49554": "Do you know what?",
  "49555": "How would you prevent it?",
  "49556": "But where are the body o 'em?",
  "49557": "What's up?",
  "49558": "And what shall I say to her?",
  "49559": "Why did you not tell him that when he was living?",
  "49560": "Must there not have been a custodian of the shrine?",
  "49561": "Eh?",
  "49562": "And after they have arrived at years of discretion by the care of their parents, are the inconveniencies attending their separation more certain than their foresight of these inconveniencies and their care of avoiding them by a close union and confederacy?",
  "49563": "This gentleman?",
  "49564": "Might I hope to be saved?",
  "49565": "You'll be no more jealous?",
  "49566": "Do you behold the beauty and the wisdom here?",
  "49567": "What is it that these have done?",
  "49568": "Was he a politician?",
  "49569": "Darnay?",
  "49570": "But are they the same as fire and snow?",
  "49571": "Why do you bring your prolifigate companions here?",
  "49572": "What'll sting him?",
  "49573": "Who is giving the reception?",
  "49574": "Have we ceased to be men?",
  "49575": "And did he not help you to rise to his own level, so that you, little by little, became his assistant in all his undertakings?",
  "49576": "What music?",
  "49577": "D'you mean to say that if you really believed you could move mountains you could?",
  "49578": "On what?",
  "49579": "Do you follow?",
  "49580": "How could I part with him?",
  "49581": "How do you suppose a man is to live?",
  "49582": "Were you present during the last struggle?",
  "49583": "Suppose I told you the janitor picked it up on the steps almost under the big snowball?",
  "49584": "Well, have I ever been slow in coming?",
  "49585": "Call yourself a religious woman?",
  "49586": "How can one be condescending to a lady to whom one owes a matter of forty pounds, and who is perpetually throwing out hints for the money?",
  "49587": "Hollow?",
  "49588": "If the existing system be a good one, why should it not be extended?",
  "49589": "And what now?",
  "49590": "Would it be possible for empty stomachs to resist such an invitation?",
  "49591": "Well, what can you expect?",
  "49592": "And what time of day does the lady receive?",
  "49593": "What do you want to ask me?",
  "49594": "Are you out of your senses?",
  "49595": "But will you have this?",
  "49596": "Is it not adherence to the old and tried, against a new and untried?",
  "49597": "Is that irresistible power, which for fifty years has shaken the government and agitated the people, to be stifled and subdued by pretending that it is an exceedingly simple thing, and we ought not to talk about it?",
  "49598": "From what place and people have you come?",
  "49599": "Will you step this way?",
  "49600": "Then one soul not being more or less absolutely a soul than another, is not more or less harmonized?",
  "49601": "And did you run after them?",
  "49602": "There's no doubt it was chloral?",
  "49603": "If he pulls me away when I talk to you, what will he do to your wife?",
  "49604": "But do you answer for them?",
  "49605": "Have you a pain or what's up with you?",
  "49606": "To what end doth she quaver with her lips, like a monkey in the dismembering of a lobster?",
  "49607": "Akim?",
  "49608": "How was it that a man so exact and fastidious could have made this error of a day?",
  "49609": "How could you suffer such a snare to be laid for him?",
  "49610": "Say, is it then so sad a thing to die?",
  "49611": "Would you think it?",
  "49612": "Not above a mile, I reckon?",
  "49613": "Was it falling?",
  "49614": "What have I to do with that, or what have you?",
  "49615": "Are you a real witch?",
  "49616": "Who can wonder at him or do anything but pity him?",
  "49617": "How can you talk so?",
  "49618": "May I come nearer now?",
  "49619": "What do you see so terrific in that, dear marquise?",
  "49620": "Gerald himself, who was responsible for all this industry, was he a good director?",
  "49621": "But what could you do in a case like that?",
  "49622": "You hint at something not honourable, then?",
  "49623": "You really mean to marry her?",
  "49624": "And what again is that about which we have no fear?",
  "49625": "What are you going to do to me for telling them this time?",
  "49626": "Are you sure of what you say?",
  "49627": "Shall I come and see you there?",
  "49628": "Could it be he had failed to note the loud warning?",
  "49629": "What more do they want?",
  "49630": "Anything fresh?",
  "49631": "But what could he have done?",
  "49632": "We shall have to ask, how did small round bucklers come to be unknown to late poets who saw them constantly?",
  "49633": "Is it going to be on the tariff?",
  "49634": "And now by mine?",
  "49635": "Farming?",
  "49636": "Surely I've put it plainly enough?",
  "49637": "What's the matter with you, young man?",
  "49638": "They are, perhaps, in truth, a little disposed to be smugglers, but what harm is in that?",
  "49639": "The man whom they are every day telling me to take such care of?",
  "49640": "Bought their possessions?",
  "49641": "I ask every sensible man if that is not so?",
  "49642": "And are you going there?",
  "49643": "Chemicals?",
  "49644": "What was he to do?",
  "49645": "May I, sir, said I, beg all your anger on myself, and to be reconciled to your good sister?",
  "49646": "What is the use of these trips, in the first place?",
  "49647": "Will you drink some of this ether and water?",
  "49648": "So that is true, is it?",
  "49649": "Have you anything to carry?",
  "49650": "Daae?",
  "49651": "Am I to be beaten too?",
  "49652": "Is it very long?",
  "49653": "In what way shall I have the money?",
  "49654": "Do I smell ginger?",
  "49655": "Do you hear me?",
  "49656": "And is this the return you make to me?",
  "49657": "Are you going?",
  "49658": "You do not give her up, monsieur?",
  "49659": "What did you lose?",
  "49660": "Have you a cab?",
  "49661": "Has her keeper been for her?",
  "49662": "In what way are schools going to help the people to improve their material position?",
  "49663": "Is it not almost to BELIEVE in one's own virtues?",
  "49664": "You will go down?",
  "49665": "Now, what mortal imagination could conceive it?",
  "49666": "Madame will await my return?",
  "49667": "And he has not married yet?",
  "49668": "Do you suppose I ever forgot you?",
  "49669": "Is your honor sure?",
  "49670": "Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?",
  "49671": "Are they not good seamen?",
  "49672": "Will you let me take the bundle now?",
  "49673": "Blest?",
  "49674": "What did he hope for?",
  "49675": "What shall I do with the horse, general?",
  "49676": "You have not turned saving, at this time of day, I hope?",
  "49677": "Did you really hear it yourself?",
  "49678": "Does no one cry here, either?",
  "49679": "And do you not imagine, he said, that if there were a competition in evil, the worst would be found to be very few?",
  "49680": "The main point, the point why MY wife had to be burnt rather than my neighbour's?",
  "49681": "What on earth were they to do with him?",
  "49682": "Well, dear?",
  "49683": "Is there to be no sale after all?",
  "49684": "And where the deuce did you pick him up?",
  "49685": "But the diamond I gave you yesterday?",
  "49686": "That were heretics?",
  "49687": "That does not seem a very likely start, does it?",
  "49688": "And you would have kept your word, monseigneur?",
  "49689": "But, what can I do for them, here?",
  "49690": "Mamma, from whom was that letter which you got this morning?",
  "49691": "Do not say that you look for none?",
  "49692": "A proof?",
  "49693": "Have you got that cross you bought from the soldier with you?",
  "49694": "Speak to her now?",
  "49695": "And was not its mouth like a parrot's beak?",
  "49696": "But the DUNCAN is a pleasure yacht, is it not?",
  "49697": "What do you think she used to do?",
  "49698": "Where is the ink, I wonder?",
  "49699": "Do these women think?",
  "49700": "Where is the road to the south?",
  "49701": "What do you say, sir?",
  "49702": "Will it last long?",
  "49703": "Did you ever mention to any one that it was your intention to give any one the treaty to be copied?",
  "49704": "How was all that to be told effectively to a young woman in gentle words?",
  "49705": "Is his son with him?",
  "49706": "Do you speak to me as a magistrate or as a friend?",
  "49707": "Was the fox alive, or was it dead?",
  "49708": "Must man always be wretched?",
  "49709": "Whither would you go first?",
  "49710": "Picked out by whom?",
  "49711": "You will do that?",
  "49712": "What sense could there be in letting the land to the peasants, on condition that they pay the rent to themselves?",
  "49713": "Who are all those persons?",
  "49714": "What would you do?",
  "49715": "What hurt have you got?",
  "49716": "Was ever man so beset as I?",
  "49717": "Any time, sir?",
  "49718": "This?",
  "49719": "Why should you thus harass yourself?",
  "49720": "How shall I ever again believe in human goodness?",
  "49721": "What on earth have you been up to, man?",
  "49722": "What was I doing yesterday at this hour?",
  "49723": "Is he a millionaire?",
  "49724": "Is it for us to see?",
  "49725": "And who is it she has tried to marry?",
  "49726": "She has no daughter of her own, has she?",
  "49727": "When can I reckon on receiving information from you?",
  "49728": "And the young man?",
  "49729": "You've only believed me contented then because you've believed me stupid?",
  "49730": "Whatever's that?",
  "49731": "So you're on to him, too?",
  "49732": "Did she love him?",
  "49733": "Then what am I?",
  "49734": "To what end all this?",
  "49735": "What rights?",
  "49736": "Will you go fetch him?",
  "49737": "How, indeed, can an instructor remedy this evil?",
  "49738": "What, teasing again?",
  "49739": "Why did you?",
  "49740": "Did she show courage?",
  "49741": "Not have it?",
  "49742": "Do you know of any?",
  "49743": "How can you be so unjust?",
  "49744": "Is the spring coming?",
  "49745": "But what is it all about?",
  "49746": "That you mean to marry me?",
  "49747": "How long have you held your position in that college?",
  "49748": "I wonder if he could have followed after us, and got lost?",
  "49749": "And your two other friends?",
  "49750": "Since when has malady banished medicine?",
  "49751": "What can we hope for at the hands of such as those?",
  "49752": "Sure, what is a kiss from the finest of women but a pleasant thing, like a long putt sunk, or the first salmon of the year caught like a trout, or the ball through the goal before the whistle blows?",
  "49753": "Is there no reality in the penitence thus sealed and witnessed by good works?",
  "49754": "Seditious to wish to be governed by good heads or leaders?",
  "49755": "Are her disappointment and sorrow of no interest to you?",
  "49756": "You are ready to sacrifice the world for love?",
  "49757": "And you take their view?",
  "49758": "With grief and trouble, my dear friend?",
  "49759": "Is it the simple or the compound, the unchanging or the changing, the invisible idea or the visible object of sense?",
  "49760": "And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie?",
  "49761": "What peevish luck have I, I cannot meet with these bragging rascals?",
  "49762": "What disagreeable people?",
  "49763": "You come from the provinces?",
  "49764": "What DO such men as he want?",
  "49765": "Meanwhile, I dare say you would like to arrange your toilette a little?",
  "49766": "Do I seek amusements outside our home?",
  "49767": "Both at the same time?",
  "49768": "See?",
  "49769": "You did come home, then?",
  "49770": "If you are not a doctor, what are you?",
  "49771": "Who calls it a vale of tears?",
  "49772": "What can you do in this dark, gloomy mystery?",
  "49773": "Whose work is this?",
  "49774": "Are you not well?",
  "49775": "What are you going to do?",
  "49776": "Am I?",
  "49777": "Settled?",
  "49778": "You'll be the new captain?",
  "49779": "How have you been?",
  "49780": "Is it good?",
  "49781": "Foster?",
  "49782": "And he is engaged to her now?",
  "49783": "Please, my dear fellow, will you sharpen my saber for me?",
  "49784": "Where did I leave?",
  "49785": "And these, if they are opposites, are generated the one from the other, and have there their two intermediate processes also?",
  "49786": "May I not say a word of comfort to him?",
  "49787": "What wonderful thing is that?",
  "49788": "What can have become of her, then?",
  "49789": "Why do you think so?",
  "49790": "Why do you bother yourself about such an idle question?",
  "49791": "Who is your friends?",
  "49792": "What day?",
  "49793": "Do you know who the devil is?",
  "49794": "Shall I tell you my theory?",
  "49795": "Damn it, but none of us have a barge for property, have we?",
  "49796": "Were you surprised, my asking you to take me out and give me a bit of dinner tonight?",
  "49797": "And are those enemies too?",
  "49798": "Am I pretty?",
  "49799": "Do you mean him harm, sir?",
  "49800": "What person?",
  "49801": "And what do you want with your flag of truce?",
  "49802": "And what do you say of him who is hated by all the people of his neighborhood?",
  "49803": "Surely not?",
  "49804": "Surely not third class?",
  "49805": "Is that another letter in your hand?",
  "49806": "Is it possible that foreign nations can either respect or confide in such a government?",
  "49807": "In what proportion?",
  "49808": "Are there many more of you to come?",
  "49809": "Has the soul offspring?",
  "49810": "And who is this?",
  "49811": "Did any of us ever do anything worth half the money?",
  "49812": "Are we to doubt this statement too, merely because no biographer has hitherto given us any information on the matter?",
  "49813": "But what's the reason?",
  "49814": "Will she come?",
  "49815": "Will that please you, dear?",
  "49816": "Out of sorts?",
  "49817": "I?",
  "49818": "Which are my fingers and which are yours?",
  "49819": "Am I not too late?",
  "49820": "But then would it not be better to do away with them entirely?",
  "49821": "And thoroughly?",
  "49822": "Had they written home to tell his mother and father?",
  "49823": "Sing, sir?",
  "49824": "Then, shall the man who is too weak to work be refused a right to the ownership of a coat?",
  "49825": "Are you in the police yourself?",
  "49826": "What hope could they entertain that any portion of the old continent still existed beyond that dreary barrier?",
  "49827": "And what is the name of this village?",
  "49828": "Are you going away, then?",
  "49829": "Was not the secret told me, in the natural recoil of my heart at the first sight of him, and as often as I have seen him since?",
  "49830": "Now, do you want a horse, or will you go afoot?",
  "49831": "Do you not understand?",
  "49832": "Oh, that book, eh?",
  "49833": "Bless you, when you come to talk of a gentleman, who is to define the word?",
  "49834": "You are better?",
  "49835": "Will you shut the door, if you please?",
  "49836": "Why, what had you been doing?",
  "49837": "Waiting for somebody?",
  "49838": "Mazarin's factotum?",
  "49839": "Did he love her in return?",
  "49840": "How many limbs have you passed?",
  "49841": "Now, are you right there?",
  "49842": "No sooner, sir?",
  "49843": "If I have said too much, or more than I meant, what of it?",
  "49844": "When is he in fact to have those full civil rights which have so long been his in law?",
  "49845": "What do you propose?",
  "49846": "Is it true that you want to marry her?",
  "49847": "That's to say, you think there's a lack of something in me?",
  "49848": "Is it consistent with the proper dignity and the manly character of a nation?",
  "49849": "When did it come?",
  "49850": "Well, and do you think that those who say so are wrong?",
  "49851": "Come now, which of the two shall speak first?",
  "49852": "Are you so much?",
  "49853": "Have you got any money?",
  "49854": "Like what she used to be, or like what she was in the carriage?",
  "49855": "Does it, in dealing with other nations, civilized or backward, propose what is palpably to its own advantage, or is it evidently disinterested?",
  "49856": "Why have you not sent to me?",
  "49857": "And now you are going?",
  "49858": "Who else knew where it was?",
  "49859": "What does he mean by that?",
  "49860": "How shall he meet that dreadful day?",
  "49861": "Did you hear anything?",
  "49862": "A dog or a baby, eh?",
  "49863": "Would you have me indeed, annihilate the memory of the bond between us?",
  "49864": "Does not the timocratical man change into the oligarchical on this wise?",
  "49865": "Where's your warrant?",
  "49866": "Did he give you this?",
  "49867": "What do you say of making an exchange?",
  "49868": "Is she happy?",
  "49869": "How do you mean here?",
  "49870": "Shall I tell you of what it reminded me?",
  "49871": "Why did his cold eye glisten, and his heart leap up as they went past?",
  "49872": "Burned it?",
  "49873": "You have nothing to regret?",
  "49874": "And who would not have so believed, hearing him so speak at the point of death?",
  "49875": "Why, then, have they lost in laboring for you what you have gained in not laboring for them?",
  "49876": "Do you remember?",
  "49877": "Raoul?",
  "49878": "Halloa?",
  "49879": "Do you know your right hand from your left?",
  "49880": "You came to tell me, eh?",
  "49881": "What bell is it?",
  "49882": "And would you now like to look round my place?",
  "49883": "How can you believe yourself?",
  "49884": "Osoph's?",
  "49885": "Ought she to try to overcome her pruderies?",
  "49886": "Perhaps you will sleep in your own room?",
  "49887": "Pray what do you call 'em?",
  "49888": "Sharks, I suppose?",
  "49889": "What brings you here?",
  "49890": "Will you live with us?",
  "49891": "All the same, how much might you be disposed to offer me for this beautiful young horse of mine?",
  "49892": "You have your chronometer?",
  "49893": "May I speak to your mistresses?",
  "49894": "You want me to throw again, do you not?",
  "49895": "Was it not enough?",
  "49896": "Did you hear what I asked you, or not?",
  "49897": "What is the destination marked on your ticket?",
  "49898": "You believe in the moon then, affecting the weather?",
  "49899": "And there was no one in it but the two of you alone?",
  "49900": "With all this, sir, said I, can you think I shall be at a loss to pass my time?",
  "49901": "Have you ever tried sulphate of copper in water?",
  "49902": "You do not suffer?",
  "49903": "To be ordained, I think you said?",
  "49904": "What about him?",

  "50299": "My father is well, is he not?",
  "50300": "Was it going farther from, or nearing, the disc?",
  "50301": "How is this?",
  "50302": "Recollect, my lord, if he did not say something a little like that to you?",
  "50303": "Is he really her cousin, as he says?",
  "50304": "Who's to prevent me?",
  "50305": "Why dig up the pestilence from the pit in which it is buried?",
  "50306": "The other question?",
  "50307": "I may go on?",
  "50308": "And by whom?",
  "50309": "It is true, then?",
  "50310": "Should an ass exceed me in fortitude?",
  "50311": "Would the island hold together till then?",
  "50312": "No, why should you?",
  "50313": "What can I do sir?",
  "50314": "Should I have remained in that house, near you and them, if I did not love them?",
  "50315": "And this letter?",
  "50316": "What is the matter?",
  "50317": "And if it be so, what is it?",
  "50318": "Mother, what are you crying for?",
  "50319": "Were I to allow you to march out, what security can I have that you will not join them, and afterwards fight against me?",
  "50320": "Reinforcements?",
  "50321": "What would it be right to do?",
  "50322": "What's up with you?",
  "50323": "Should it ever be said that he had robbed those old men, whom he so truly and so tenderly loved in his heart of hearts?",
  "50324": "What made you think he'd ceased to take any interest in the case?",
  "50325": "Is it anything I have done that has pulled you down like that?",
  "50326": "What could my father mean by sending me to be an inmate in this strange family?",
  "50327": "You mean you'll have no quarrel with me?",
  "50328": "Was he awake or was he asleep?",
  "50329": "Well, but if I bought the mill, and allowed your husband to act as my manager in the same way, how then?",
  "50330": "What am I to do if I love him and the other one too?",
  "50331": "And have you come from far like this?",
  "50332": "And what did I tell 'ee?",
  "50333": "Could she, who had been so active in the getting up of the funeral triumph, do less than exult?",
  "50334": "Who now will tell the ladies that I would hie me thither?",
  "50335": "What is genius?",
  "50336": "You have taken care, I hope, of the casket I sent you to lock up?",
  "50337": "What evils?",
  "50338": "And is it wounded?",
  "50339": "What recollections of boyhood and innocence might have been flitting across his brain?",
  "50340": "What noise is that?",
  "50341": "No dignity in whaling?",
  "50342": "Why could they not wait a little?",
  "50343": "No apology, I suppose?",
  "50344": "What are you thinking of?",
  "50345": "How have I offended?",
  "50346": "Why should we be unable to preserve a remembrance of them?",
  "50347": "There is something else you wanted to say?",
  "50348": "Was I not right in saying at the outset that, relatively to the tax, we are behind our institutions?",
  "50349": "What charge, sir?",
  "50350": "Did you see no one?",
  "50351": "Oh, may I get this rose?",
  "50352": "He asked me whether I would go with him?",
  "50353": "Why did you leave him on the road?",
  "50354": "And in such a case what is one to say?",
  "50355": "But as I am not bound to give in to your plans, any more than you are compelled to submit to mine, may I ask to know if you have formed any which depend on my assistance?",
  "50356": "Yes, why?",
  "50357": "To which of us?",
  "50358": "Could we not break it?",
  "50359": "What does he drink?",
  "50360": "But however are you going to race in this mud?",
  "50361": "Is this the part of wise men, engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty?",
  "50362": "Cannot you describe her?",
  "50363": "And that which is not more or less a harmony is not more or less harmonized?",
  "50364": "A joke?",
  "50365": "What is his folly?",
  "50366": "I must, then, remain here?",
  "50367": "Who were they?",
  "50368": "Mercenary, mem?",
  "50369": "Is that worth talking about and making so much ado?",
  "50370": "When are you starting?",
  "50371": "You want no treasures and no castles?",
  "50372": "Now then, gentlemen, shall I break the seal or not?",
  "50373": "It must have been on the boulevard?",
  "50374": "Could a statue of marble have been more impassive and more mute?",
  "50375": "Would you like to?",
  "50376": "Do you call yourself a raw country girl?",
  "50377": "And, then, do you think that my stumps are pretty?",
  "50378": "But do you fail to live?",
  "50379": "Sure it's he?",
  "50380": "Whose fault?",
  "50381": "She has formed no other attachment?",
  "50382": "What matter?",
  "50383": "And wherefore has he not been to see me?",
  "50384": "Shall we really try it?",
  "50385": "Doth any praise himself?",
  "50386": "I tried to decline taking the guinea on the first occasion, but with no better effect than causing her to ask me very angrily, if I expected more?",
  "50387": "Now, then, where's the first boy?",
  "50388": "What has age to do with it?",
  "50389": "What besides?",
  "50390": "Separate, my dear?",
  "50391": "And alone?",
  "50392": "Why should I pull her into it?",
  "50393": "No cheering news, then?",
  "50394": "And with what object?",
  "50395": "Monks would never learn how you knew what you do?",
  "50396": "What do you keep SAYING you will for?",
  "50397": "Was it so?",
  "50398": "But the earl?",
  "50399": "Do you see, now, one reason why I have let you go thus early into the world?",
  "50400": "Will you show me your plan?",
  "50401": "What needs appealing in a fact so plain?",
  "50402": "And if he have great riches, to you leave him all his wealth, or do you make him a beggar?",
  "50403": "Bast?",
  "50404": "What was it you wanted to ask, sir?",
  "50405": "Did you ever hear such a name?",
  "50406": "Can it attack it beneath the waves?",
  "50407": "Are we to expect nothing but chivalric tenderness and compassion from men who made war on a tolerant government to make more secure their barbaric system of oppression?",
  "50408": "If we had to keep account of our amours, we should be just as embarrassed as this cytisus which you apostrophized would be in counting up his descendants, should we not?",
  "50409": "To those who love as ourselves, in what respect differs a year from an hour?",
  "50410": "And you think that just?",
  "50411": "You will start at once?",
  "50412": "To what point of the continent?",
  "50413": "Will you play?",
  "50414": "What's to hinder 'em from cutting right and left if they begin?",
  "50415": "Give up the parish altogether?",
  "50416": "And what was the policy of that ally?",
  "50417": "But who should tell him so?",
  "50418": "Her voice when she talked to them?",
  "50419": "Would the militia, in this supposition, be more ready or more able to support the federal authority than in the case of a general union?",
  "50420": "Is he in favor of all these things at once?",
  "50421": "How are they represented, whose very sweat supports the splendid stud of an heir apparent, or varnishes the chariot of some female favourite who looks down on shame?",
  "50422": "Or show you restless, miswandering, misclimbing ones, new and easier footpaths?",
  "50423": "Do you think the thing possible?",
  "50424": "Is the door shut?",
  "50425": "But what will you do?",
  "50426": "Well, then, have you any better plan to propose?",
  "50427": "What, have you a wife, then?",
  "50428": "But does nothing depend on it for them?",
  "50429": "You are well?",
  "50430": "You do love me still?",
  "50431": "Where do your excellencies wish to go?",
  "50432": "Then what the devil brought you here, being a churchman?",
  "50433": "You know what to beautify is, I suppose?",
  "50434": "How can I commit such treachery?",
  "50435": "And what is it doing in the world?",
  "50436": "Do you know, sir?",
  "50437": "And what does it amount to, after all?",
  "50438": "By his son, sir?",
  "50439": "But how, madame?",
  "50440": "What course is that?",
  "50441": "What did the gardener say?",
  "50442": "Why cucumber sandwiches?",
  "50443": "A duel, you mean?",
  "50444": "Ma foi, what rival?",
  "50445": "Do I then strive after HAPPINESS?",
  "50446": "One should never admit anything in electioneering matters, should one?",
  "50447": "Is she game for that?",
  "50448": "Is it void of understanding?",
  "50449": "And who dictated it?",
  "50450": "Was it not this?",
  "50451": "Who's there?",
  "50452": "What next, I wonder?",
  "50453": "What ails you?",
  "50454": "But what of that, so long as it tickles the palate more strongly?",
  "50455": "Is the sea not full of green islands?",
  "50456": "There is a deficit, you say?",
  "50457": "And is it the case now?",
  "50458": "Because you can see she is in love with you?",
  "50459": "Who was the man?",
  "50460": "Where does he tempt one to stray from duty?",
  "50461": "What does it strike you that I've done?",
  "50462": "Money down?",
  "50463": "Jane's mother is going to let her have a birthday party?",
  "50464": "Have you not shelter, and food, and leisure?",
  "50465": "And what can be said in, at least, partial defence of the actual historical procedure of the nations?",
  "50466": "What should I get by sending to you?",
  "50467": "Supposing that the abused, the oppressed, the suffering, the unemancipated, the weary, and those uncertain of themselves should moralize, what will be the common element in their moral estimates?",
  "50468": "Sailors?",
  "50469": "You found her well and awaiting you?",
  "50470": "Where is it located?",
  "50471": "Why, what do you mean?",
  "50472": "What other men can be thirty leagues under ground?",
  "50473": "What, is it laborers they want for the harvest?",
  "50474": "Who shall describe the anxiety, the agony, which in some measure must have been the lot of every frontier family?",
  "50475": "What the devil are you doing there in such an agitated manner?",
  "50476": "And what will that signify to me?",
  "50477": "Why will you be silent?",
  "50478": "How then stands the case?",
  "50479": "And you think it funny, no doubt?",
  "50480": "What is gentleness?",
  "50481": "Do you wish this change so very much, sir?",
  "50482": "Do you think I can teach a small school?",
  "50483": "What can I do, my son?",
  "50484": "For a more active primate?",
  "50485": "What on earth is up?",
  "50486": "Where are you going, then, dear bear?",
  "50487": "Shall we have them sit up to the table and serve them with the complete dinner, enlivening it with intellectual conversation?",
  "50488": "And so the doctor walked, backwards and forwards through the garden, slowly, thinking now with some earnestness what if, after all, he had been wrong about his niece?",
  "50489": "Well, fwiend?",
  "50490": "And papa's written consent?",
  "50491": "How could he have been so forgetful?",
  "50492": "And taking it as a story, what do you think of it?",
  "50493": "Can he be afraid of this boy?",
  "50494": "How about returning?",
  "50495": "Well, what is there surprising in that?",
  "50496": "Do you see any objection?",
  "50497": "I wonder when he got the message?",
  "50498": "You will, of course, command it yourself?",
  "50499": "What in the name heaven shall I do?",
  "50500": "What is the process for releasing a prisoner?",
  "50501": "O, what's up now?",
  "50502": "I mean, have you ever been where there's water?",
  "50503": "How could I forget it?",
  "50504": "And where is her husband?",
  "50505": "Thomasin, do you know that they have had a bitter quarrel?",
  "50506": "So you're in the washing business, ma'am?",
  "50507": "And I am to hide my guilt, as I have done so many years?",
  "50508": "Pray what was his offence?",
  "50509": "Was it possible he had deceived himself so utterly about her?",
  "50510": "What was it you put on that chair near the window?",
  "50511": "Who else is it?",
  "50512": "Why should I try to shield him from the consequences of his own wicked acts?",
  "50513": "When do you think of setting out?",
  "50514": "Would your dog go with him?",
  "50515": "Where's mother?",

  "50523": "What evil has befallen our royal house?",
  "50524": "Are you certain of that?",
  "50525": "What was there after all?",
  "50526": "Clara, my love, have you forgotten?",
  "50527": "Was he to send out privy seals?",
  "50528": "Is this the moment to dispute as to individual liberty and safety, when the question is the preservation of political liberty and national independence?",

  "50530": "What's the matter with you?",
  "50531": "Who can look at these rocks, and allow the voluptuousness of nature to be an excuse for gratifying the desires it inspires?",
  "50532": "Where in the world have you been, my lad?",
  "50533": "For do you not see the wide and unknown wilderness behind?",
  "50534": "Yes, who was she?",
  "50535": "And do you cool yourself in that stream now, my young friend?",
  "50536": "Why, especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not care about me?",
  "50537": "What better way was there to take care of his life in the helpless growing time than by passing him into obscurity?",
  "50538": "Are you going anywhere in particular just now?",
  "50539": "What are you but a boy?",
  "50540": "See you nothing walking on the shore of the pond?",
  "50541": "Which one?",
  "50542": "Is it ill done?",
  "50543": "You're sure you had it on when you left the ball?",
  "50544": "What more do you know about him?",
  "50545": "But may I give it to you?",
  "50546": "Male or female, sir?",
  "50547": "What is the latest news about your father?",
  "50548": "Are you educated, young sir?",
  "50549": "You promise it?",
  "50550": "Going?",
  "50551": "And what would you say of the physician?",
  "50552": "Or did you do so, in the service of a perishing state, by the punishment of an axe?",
  "50553": "On account of your approaching marriage with her?",
  "50554": "Something that crossed me?",
  "50555": "You could not have made any slip in coming?",

  "50557": "Copperfield?",
  "50558": "WHAT'S that?",
  "50559": "What has monsieur to say for him?",
  "50560": "You are going, sir?",
  "50561": "Sire, you have forgiven me, then?",
  "50562": "Was there even a single reason to be so?",
  "50563": "Knows she of this?",
  "50564": "I've a good mind to turn them out of the house this moment?",
  "50565": "Has she come with designs upon me?",
  "50566": "What is art beside love?",
  "50567": "What are your orders about the pictures?",
  "50568": "Still, if I may venture a suggestion, in what way are these two people endeavouring to entrap us?",
  "50569": "If it was out of the way and no one wanted it, no one could mind my having it, could they?",
  "50570": "Then you all came back again, ma'am?",
  "50571": "And if I am myself, you mean?",
  "50572": "How should he be helped?",
  "50573": "Who else can have such processions and vestments and music?",
  "50574": "Who knows, but she may have found the joy she sought?",
  "50575": "You think so?",
  "50576": "You are certain of this amount?",
  "50577": "Yes, but the horses?",
  "50578": "Or how remove the encumbrance?",
  "50579": "If so, shall I take you anywhere?",
  "50580": "Or will you be contented with the first now, and stay for the other till after grace?",
  "50581": "What's a peculiar man to a nation?",
  "50582": "What is it?",
  "50583": "Are you happy here?",
  "50584": "You were only in fun?",
  "50585": "And washing?",
  "50586": "There still remained an arrest to be effected, but what were these commonplace rogues that he should soil his hands with them?",
  "50587": "How dare you appeal to me just now, you false rascal, as if we had been in discussion together?",
  "50588": "Where would his miserable wife, the accursed, lovely sinner, find him, when she sought him again?",
  "50589": "Why is it that scarcely any are executed but the poor?",
  "50590": "Can you realize that death, which you have yet no immediate experience of, is the greatest of evil?",
  "50591": "Did you force it away from her, or did you steal it?",
  "50592": "Well, there it is, you see what you are pitting yourselves against?",
  "50593": "Of wood?",
  "50594": "Angry?",
  "50595": "What do you mean by thinking about it?",
  "50596": "What, who are you?",
  "50597": "What did you lie to me for, then?",
  "50598": "Is it true?",
  "50599": "Are you trying to get to church?",
  "50600": "You would agree with me?",
  "50601": "The deuce on you, what more might a king, an emperor, or a pope wish for?",
  "50602": "Once when?",
  "50603": "But why should you see him?",
  "50604": "Is it sheer love of their species, and an unadulterated wish to see young people happy and dancing?",
  "50605": "Is it possible that you do not know of whom you purchased it?",
  "50606": "Have I interrupted a conversation?",
  "50607": "And then of what use would be pursuit?",
  "50608": "Well, and is not this one quality, to mention no others, greatly at variance with present notions of him?",
  "50609": "Do you know him?",
  "50610": "Why cannot we ever know all about another, especially when that other has been guilty?",
  "50611": "And he would not have found the same resources on the side we are making for?",
  "50612": "But who should speak first?",
  "50613": "Whether you did not also pledge yourself to astonish the government, and make them shrink in their shoes?",
  "50614": "Or have you forgotten them?",
  "50615": "Upon my word, madam, what are you saying?",
  "50616": "Who shall presume to imitate the colors of the tulip, or to improve the proportions of the lily of the valley?",
  "50617": "Is he wild?",
  "50618": "Are you presuming to question me?",
  "50619": "Tea or chocolate?",
  "50620": "Where's the box with the new clothing and necessaries for them?",
  "50621": "Why not donkeys?",
  "50622": "Who goes here?",
  "50623": "Is it because human nature is generally grateful, and makes us conclude, that a man who does any harm never received any favour from the person he harmed?",
  "50624": "What could my darling do, I asked, left destitute and penniless?",
  "50625": "But what right had you?",
  "50626": "Signs and wonders, eh?",
  "50627": "Were they all fastened this morning?",
  "50628": "Do you sincerely wish me to be your wife?",
  "50629": "What do you still apprehend?",
  "50630": "Well, and did papa do what he wanted for him?",
  "50631": "Father's form?",
  "50632": "And what do you think they found in the pockets?",
  "50633": "But, let me ask ye, sir, have you been as intelligible to the girl?",
  "50634": "And are the lions large?",
  "50635": "Have you ever sat before?",
  "50636": "What are you here for?",
  "50637": "What are we to do, sir?",
  "50638": "You are sure of this, are you?",
  "50639": "I wonder whether she will ask me to be a bridesmaid?",
  "50640": "Is she well?",
  "50641": "And tribute paiment gone along with him?",

  "50649": "She'll ask you, presently, if she is to owe her excuse to your interposition?",
  "50650": "Did he give you any details?",
  "50651": "Have you seen him, mother?",
  "50652": "Are they going to be so mean as to call my uncle out of bed, to show him what I've been doing?",
  "50653": "But what do I know?",
  "50654": "But will your uncle be angry if we have the breakfast up there?",

  "51259": "Will it not be better that she should keep the resentment of the insult for ever?",
  "51260": "What could be the cause of this phenomenon?",
  "51261": "Or whether it eats and drinks?",
  "51262": "But what would you say in it?",

  "53752": "What are you laughing at?",
  "53753": "First, will your ladyship allow me to ask you whether you have had any strange visitors this morning?",

  "55122": "Should not a magistrate be not merely the best administrator of the law, but the most crafty expounder of the chicanery of his profession, a steel probe to search hearts, a touchstone to try the gold which in each soul is mingled with more or less of alloy?",
  "55123": "Then I must wait here, or in the neighborhood?",
  "55124": "And what is her name?",

  "55162": "And if I do it for him, what do you think he's promised me?",
  "55163": "And will moralists pretend to assert, that this is the condition in which one half of the human race should be encouraged to remain with listless inactivity and stupid acquiescence?",
  "55164": "And did you not tell him to go back?",
  "55165": "I hope that I make it all plain?",
  "55166": "And is the soul seen or not seen?",
  "55167": "And was it only fancy which induced me to believe that, with the increase of my own firmness, that of my tormentor underwent a proportional diminution?",
  "55168": "Can you tell me where I am?",

  "55224": "Who could hear unmoved of the fall of that which had been so great, and which had stood so long?",
  "55225": "Did he wish to wait until night, and leave the submarine passage secretly?",
  "55226": "Is there anything more?",
  "55227": "Because you're so sure he so really wants my company?",

  "55250": "Does that person want you?",
  "55251": "Will he explain it?",
  "55252": "Was he to be carried back by the wind which had blown him there?",
  "55253": "What is to be done then?",
  "55254": "Where is a candle?",
  "55255": "May they not have believed, in fact, that it was a plant fallen from the sky, a gift of the divinity?",

  "55297": "Do you know why?",
  "55298": "Why, what's the MATTER with you?",
  "55299": "My dear friend, what has happened?",

  "55302": "Nice?",
  "55303": "May its poppet come in and talk?",
  "55304": "Yet still I have my uses, uses that vanish in monotony, and still I must ask why should we bury the talent of these bright sensations altogether?",
  "55305": "And what was it this time last year?",
  "55306": "But what is theory?",
  "55307": "Then, sir, you are satisfied?",

  "55323": "And do you really flatter yourself that I shall yield to all your caprices, and quietly and humbly await the time of again being received into your good graces?",
  "55324": "What had he come there to do?",
  "55325": "And how stands the fact?",
  "55326": "Do you ever work, child?",
  "55327": "You hear, sir?",
  "55328": "What would you do if you were in my place?",
  "55329": "The gentleman to whom I had the honour of being introduced?",
  "55330": "Not to see the father?",

  "55346": "But as a man of honor should answer another, tell me fairly, shall you pay these with the same punctuality?",
  "55347": "And when doth this take place?",
  "55348": "But his stables had been searched?",
  "55349": "But, it will be asked further, can I make any use of this conception and hypothesis in my investigations into the world and nature?",

  "55366": "Or cometh it in person?",
  "55367": "What more can we do?",
  "55368": "What in the world does the man mean?",
  "55369": "What does anybody want here?",
  "55370": "Why, do you know how pretty you are, child?",
  "55371": "Will you not allow that I have as much of the spirit of prophecy in me as the swans?",

  "56160": "Did you hear that are snap?",
  "56161": "What is it then?",
  "56162": "What, has she been here?",
  "56163": "Fernand, do you mean?",
  "56164": "And also to be within and between them?",
  "56165": "Was this possible or that possible?",
  "56166": "You call me a cobweb?",
  "56167": "And you are ruined?",
  "56168": "Well, do you want to get in a comedy or on the vaudeville or in the chorus?",
  "56169": "What do you want to unsettle me for?",
  "56170": "Do you threaten me, madame?",
  "56171": "And far from here?",
  "56172": "Must I confess?",
  "56173": "Are you unbaptized?",
  "56174": "My own showing?",
  "56175": "Was I mistaken?",
  "56176": "Who will discover this wonderful something?",
  "56177": "Destroyed?",
  "56178": "Did he excavate it?",
  "56179": "And where is the speaker?",
  "56180": "How are you and he getting on with your studies?",
  "56181": "Have you learnt how to shudder yet?",
  "56182": "Will you shake hands?",
  "56183": "Now is not this too bad?",
  "56184": "Besides, who but a prig would set himself high aims, or make high resolves at all?",
  "56185": "When, how, why had this hair been shut up in this drawer?",
  "56186": "How much weighs each bag of tools?",
  "56187": "Is she a political one?",
  "56188": "Does his mother then, keep poisons in her laboratory?",
  "56189": "Am I to understand, then, that I have received no promise?",
  "56190": "Did I hinder you?",
  "56191": "Which was he to take?",
  "56192": "Who's that?",
  "56193": "Can you tell me?",
  "56194": "Or is she an elfish spirit, who, as the legends of our childhood taught us, is forbidden to cross a running stream?",
  "56195": "Why ask me?",
  "56196": "Which means?",
  "56197": "But in a government which is to be well founded, will it be best to admit of a community in everything which is capable thereof, or only in some particulars, but in others not?",
  "56198": "Will he agree?",
  "56199": "Will ten pounds do it, sir?",
  "56200": "Shining, is it?",
  "56201": "Can he leave the island if he likes?",
  "56202": "But how is he now?",
  "56203": "A bird or a peacock?",
  "56204": "Speak, you old cent per cent fornicator?",
  "56205": "If it's any of my business, how the devil did you ever get into that bally jungle?",

  "56209": "And what does she say, requiring consideration?",
  "56210": "What had happened?",
  "56211": "Where is she staying?",
  "56212": "Did it spread towards other parts of the island?",
  "56213": "The garden?",
  "56214": "Do you think it's possible?",
  "56215": "I suppose they were government matches, then?",
  "56216": "You knew him?",
  "56217": "What was the fair lady's game?",
  "56218": "Is it war?",

  "56222": "Where could she be?",
  "56223": "Will you take me in your company?",
  "56224": "How do you expect me to know such things?",
  "56225": "Then the just soul and the just man will live well, and the unjust man will live ill?",
  "56226": "And how does he clean the boots?",
  "56227": "Has C, a hatter, the right to force D, his neighbor and also a hatter, to close his shop, and cease his business?",
  "56228": "When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did they not lick his blood?",
  "56229": "Where do you land?",
  "56230": "Yet you cried out?",
  "56231": "Perhaps the other gentleman called, sir?",
  "56232": "Do you know what that is a warning of?",
  "56233": "Have you turned the case over in your mind?",
  "56234": "Why should I not confess it, gentlemen?",
  "56235": "Am I worse than I believe myself to be?",
  "56236": "How about moving that drugget?",
  "56237": "But you had a gun and bayonet besides?",
  "56238": "Do I sing?",
  "56239": "What do I want?",
  "56240": "What man?",
  "56241": "At good profit?",
  "56242": "Carton?",
  "56243": "And advancing?",
  "56244": "You are in mourning for some near relation?",
  "56245": "Do you know any who belong to the latter category?",
  "56246": "Now, what do you say about her doctor?",
  "56247": "Did your worship speak to me?",
  "56248": "Who are these people?",
  "56249": "Could it be an impartial one?",
  "56250": "What do you down here, my friend?",
  "56251": "Could he suspect my true identity?",
  "56252": "And the women?",
  "56253": "Suppose I do not want to be happy, what is the source of the obligation?",
  "56254": "Or the generous deed out of selfishness?",
  "56255": "Were you sent here to praise me?",
  "56256": "How do you feel now, dear?",
  "56257": "She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?",
  "56258": "You know him, then?",
  "56259": "Will he always come when you call him?",
  "56260": "And what has that to do with me?",
  "56261": "Why compliment him on being a romantic reactionary aristocrat?",
  "56262": "In the first place, and before everything else, sir, is the news as bad in your opinion as I am asked to believe?",
  "56263": "But how was it that the grooms knew it?",
  "56264": "Will you appoint a meeting for six months hence?",
  "56265": "Find it easy?",
  "56266": "Were they going over to the other side?",
  "56267": "So you will send me that book, dear count?",
  "56268": "But it's over now?",
  "56269": "Am I talking?",
  "56270": "And to what?",
  "56271": "Have I always hated you so much?",
  "56272": "How does he use it?",
  "56273": "You will sing with me?",
  "56274": "Grant?",
  "56275": "What did I borrow?",
  "56276": "Am I not clearly designated in that, captain?",
  "56277": "And with what purpose could he do that?",
  "56278": "What is it that this polypragmonetic ardelion to all the fiends of hell doth aim at?",
  "56279": "What has happened that you should speak like that?",
  "56280": "What means, then, this dithyramb upon property?",
  "56281": "And where afterwards?",
  "56282": "What reason was there for assuming any probability of an uprising in the city?",
  "56283": "Ah, friends, what shall I do?",
  "56284": "Do we not both take from the poor people that which they can ill spare?",
  "56285": "What is the place, then, upon which we stand?",
  "56286": "Is he a man of fortune?",
  "56287": "How dare to repeat experiments that had failed so often?",
  "56288": "There is still another influence, what do you say to that?",
  "56289": "What makes you ask?",
  "56290": "Now, who can this other letter be from?",
  "56291": "But how is it he is not already returned?",
  "56292": "What is to be the manner of her death?",
  "56293": "Wizard?",
  "56294": "And, conversely, that which has less of truth will also have less of essence?",
  "56295": "You mean that they would shipwreck?",
  "56296": "Swinging by the chain?",
  "56297": "What put it into your head, little mother?",
  "56298": "Then it is very thin wine?",
  "56299": "Did I offer to hit him or did I not?",
  "56300": "And what temperature may that be?",
  "56301": "Have you a pair of silent shoes?",
  "56302": "Who else should do so?",
  "56303": "And to what effect?",
  "56304": "I shall meet them there, and who knows what future advantages may result from the interview?",
  "56305": "Could it have been aught but a shipwreck which had drawn it under the water?",
  "56306": "The song?",
  "56307": "Shall you go?",
  "56308": "How are you, my dear?",
  "56309": "Why then not trace the rights of man to the creation of man?",
  "56310": "How did you know about it?",
  "56311": "How about that?",
  "56312": "Who knows it?",
  "56313": "You were alluding to the jerking movement of my hand every time I try to reach for anything?",
  "56314": "What the devil was you afraid of?",
  "56315": "What did he do before he went?",
  "56316": "Your alphabet?",
  "56317": "What's up?",
  "56318": "Which house is that?",
  "56319": "What's your real name?",
  "56320": "Why were they so strangely silent?",
  "56321": "Is it an amusing story?",
  "56322": "You were, were you not?",
  "56323": "Do you find the answer?",
  "56324": "At last she is dead?",
  "56325": "Time to start?",
  "56326": "You understand?",
  "56327": "But how did you know that I was a prisoner back there?",
  "56328": "Wherein?",
  "56329": "Which do you prefer?",
  "56330": "What can be more gratifying than such a retrospect as this?",
  "56331": "What did she say?",
  "56332": "Oh, indeed?",
  "56333": "Besides, which am I to choose?",
  "56334": "Instead, then, of consecrating monopolies from which the holders are to derive no privilege save that of straightway losing, with the income, all the enjoyment thereof, why not decree the agrarian law at once?",
  "56335": "Go to?",
  "56336": "But how could I, a poor dazed village lad, avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best and wisest of men fall every day?",
  "56337": "Well, why not?",
  "56338": "What does it all mean?",
  "56339": "I may assume that there is a second to be mentioned?",
  "56340": "Your father is dead?",
  "56341": "Of whom?",
  "56342": "Natasha, you would not deceive me?",
  "56343": "What were you doing in the battle, my friend?",
  "56344": "But does not this expose himself more than me?",
  "56345": "And is not this the reason why of old love has been called a tyrant?",
  "56346": "What are you doing here?",
  "56347": "Why not take a number of banths and set them loose before us above ground?",
  "56348": "How long did he wear it?",
  "56349": "Is he not a prey which will always be within your grasp?",
  "56350": "What instructing do you think I should do?",
  "56351": "What took her away?",
  "56352": "Yes, how long?",
  "56353": "Is it not the separation of soul and body?",
  "56354": "It is said to have been a congestion of the brain, or apoplexy, which is the same thing, is it not?",
  "56355": "Executions?",
  "56356": "Have commissioned you to tell me what you have just stated?",
  "56357": "Remorse or regret?",
  "56358": "How am I to describe it?",
  "56359": "Tulkinghorn?",
  "56360": "Why are you smiling, prince?",
  "56361": "And if he had not, why did he take her again?",
  "56362": "That is your intention, is it not?",
  "56363": "Will it pass?",
  "56364": "Why did you pick him?",
  "56365": "Do you suppose these stoneless mounds hide no dust of what were men just as good?",
  "56366": "Where are those passionate eyes that appeal'd to my eyes in passion?",
  "56367": "What is it that you say you are going to do?",
  "56368": "What did she send?",
  "56369": "Should he find him at all?",
  "56370": "Why should I meddle?",
  "56371": "The earlier it might be, would it not be better?",
  "56372": "The theories say that, do they?",
  "56373": "And what hope was there that these designs would fail?",
  "56374": "Not from the photos I have showed you?",
  "56375": "Have you ever noticed that the ones we would love the most distractedly are those whom we never meet to know?",
  "56376": "Well, then, my lord, say, are you satisfied?",
  "56377": "Gentlemen, do you stare?",
  "56378": "Well, what do you want?",
  "56379": "Why, monsieur, what secret can you expect to find in the hollow head of a soldier?",
  "56380": "Are you going to return there?",
  "56381": "What need has it of exaggeration?",
  "56382": "What if she loves you now better than anyone?",
  "56383": "Do you happen to know any one in this neighbourhood who would receive him for a while on my paying for him beforehand?",
  "56384": "He has done his best, but what does a fish's best come to when the fish is out of water?",
  "56385": "You are a reactionary, then?",
  "56386": "What's up, anyhow?",
  "56387": "Will there, indeed?",
  "56388": "Who drove you to it?",
  "56389": "We being strangers here, how dare you trust so great a charge from your own custody?",
  "56390": "You are a wheelwright?",
  "56391": "Does that suit you?",
  "56392": "Is anything the matter, aunt?",
  "56393": "And shall we just carelessly allow children to hear any casual tales which may be devised by casual persons, and to receive into their minds ideas for the most part the very opposite of those which we should wish them to have when they are grown up?",
  "56394": "But did be profess any attachment?",
  "56395": "Who are you, madame?",
  "56396": "Did you ever taste beer?",
  "56397": "Boomer?",
  "56398": "Does he mean to say that?",
  "56399": "How much fudder is got for go?",
  "56400": "And when hereafter, for any cause, the people in this place shall desire to find new homes, if they wish to be rid of the institution, where will they find the place to go to?",
  "56401": "And what would their parents think of me, if they saw or heard the children rioting, hatless, bonnetless, gloveless, and bootless, in the deep soft snow?",
  "56402": "Is anyone up in your house?",
  "56403": "Will that suit you?",
  "56404": "Have I not explained your wishes, grandpapa?",
  "56405": "Did you see it?",
  "56406": "And, to be frank, my lord, was I wrong?",
  "56407": "From what?",
  "56408": "Herod?",
  "56409": "Cautious, why so?",
  "56410": "Was it the better to deceive them both?",
  "56411": "Did you tell us?",
  "56412": "Do you understand what you have done to me?",
  "56413": "Nor church?",
  "56414": "Does it end with just our two selves?",
  "56415": "Will there be beds for me and all who seek?",
  "56416": "What virtue will there be then, said the monk, in their bullets of concupiscence, their habits and their bodies?",
  "56417": "How do I know?",
  "56418": "In what direction?",
  "56419": "And of such a man too?",
  "56420": "What good am I here?",
  "56421": "Do you mean what did I say?",
  "56422": "What did the whole world matter to them?",
  "56423": "You feel some pretty well now?",
  "56424": "The man says?",
  "56425": "How should I make a mistake?",
  "56426": "Will you have hash or fishballs for breakfast?",
  "56427": "What signifies?",
  "56428": "Did she mean to go out?",
  "56429": "Where is she?",
  "56430": "Do you know where they came from?",
  "56431": "Did you see him come out on us?",
  "56432": "Why lie awake nights worrying about this?",
  "56433": "And if I did not obey his call, who could answer for what might happen?",
  "56434": "Or worse than the parts they acted require?",
  "56435": "What did you go out for?",
  "56436": "Well, then, what's the sense in wasting the plates?",
  "56437": "Can we not, then, men of common sense, while awaiting the solution which the future will undoubtedly bring forth, prepare ourselves for this great transition by an analysis of the struggling powers, as well as their positive and negative qualities?",
  "56438": "Have you not lately renewed your promise?",
  "56439": "Whose are these beautiful green meadows?",
  "56440": "And why do we set our soul and body, which are such dear companions, at such variance?",
  "56441": "Living together?",
  "56442": "Did you never hear it?",
  "56443": "And what else is paper currency?",
  "56444": "And do you propose to make this journey very shortly?",
  "56445": "But what if fresh disasters should take place?",
  "56446": "Who will say they were not beautiful?",
  "56447": "Is anybody to come and fetch me?",
  "56448": "But when?",
  "56449": "And what explanation is given of the girl's death?",
  "56450": "What was the dreadful thing I dreamed?",
  "56451": "I should think it was a very pleasant life, the married one, eh?",
  "56452": "But what shall we reply to the medals, undoubtedly genuine, which reckon the fifth year of his tribunitian power?",
  "56453": "Have we either of us ever rubbed thumbs over honestly gained farthings?",
  "56454": "Ah, you are the young woman come to look after my birds?",
  "56455": "Why could not I, going up to bed with my basket of keys, stop to sit down by her fire and accommodate myself for a little while to her, at least as well as to anybody else, and not trouble myself about the harmless things she said to me?",
  "56456": "In order, perhaps, to give countenance to the objection at any rate, it may be asked, is there not danger of an opposite bias in the national government, which may dispose it to endeavor to secure a monopoly of the federal administration to the landed class?",
  "56457": "How can we help it?",
  "56458": "Why do you ask such a question, I said, when you ought rather to be answering?",
  "56459": "Would you say six or four years?",
  "56460": "Would you shoot a poor, defenceless girl?",
  "56461": "Which is the duke?",
  "56462": "Now, are you ready?",
  "56463": "Can you write shorthand?",
  "56464": "Yes, why did I not steal?",
  "56465": "Will you say it is because the body is the medium of suffering in this life?",
  "56466": "Now you will be able to go home and tell your friends that you have personally seen and heard the southern lights, for I suppose you have no doubt that you have really done so?",
  "56467": "And are who what?",
  "56468": "You are of my opinion?",
  "56469": "Could it be possible that the squire was going to make a fool of himself and get married?",
  "56470": "But you will?",
  "56471": "How much is it?",
  "56472": "You will permit me to consider him an invalid?",
  "56473": "Where is he concealed?",
  "56474": "But was it his fault?",
  "56475": "You spoke to my coachman, then?",
  "56476": "Was the photograph a cabinet?",
  "56477": "Who's go dar?",
  "56478": "For the commission, is it not my whole future?",
  "56479": "Why all this excitement?",
  "56480": "Do you know the numbers?",
  "56481": "Do you wish you may die if you do know, hey?",
  "56482": "Why then should he repine when the hour of separation arrives?",
  "56483": "She had no reason for walking elsewhere, and why should she not go that way?",
  "56484": "Where is the knave?",
  "56485": "Any news, father?",
  "56486": "When did you see him last?",
  "56487": "Why, pray, did he add the old day?",
  "56488": "You think he went off just by chance?",
  "56489": "Is the cause of my soreness such a mystery that there's any need to tell me I am sore everywhere the staff hit me?",
  "56490": "What be these two, signior?",
  "56491": "Can anyone here play the drum?",
  "56492": "Shall you like to have such a brother?",
  "56493": "And what is better than woman?",
  "56494": "Ye much hurt?",
  "56495": "How shall I ever look this man in the face again?",
  "56496": "Yes?",
  "56497": "You think there may be fighting?",
  "56498": "Could it be that by some neglect in the preparations, the substitution perhaps of the wrong brandy, the astralization could not be effected?",
  "56499": "Was this to her doom after all?",
  "56500": "How agreed?",
  "56501": "And those papers?",
  "56502": "How is the gentleman called?",
  "56503": "What do you mean, you minx?",
  "56504": "What can be done?",
  "56505": "And why are we here?",
  "56506": "Amontillado ?",
  "56507": "A coffin?",
  "56508": "Does it suggest anything to your mind?",
  "56509": "Is the second floor at home?",
  "56510": "Could I forget that last autumn at this same day of the month and at this same place you lighted exactly such a fire as a signal for me to come and see you?",
  "56511": "You are certain?",
  "56512": "Why, did you not hear all we said?",
  "56513": "How, how?",
  "56514": "Is this statement true?",
  "56515": "Then it is my place to ask you what you are going to do about it?",
  "56516": "Why are you up so early, my dear?",
  "56517": "Who will tell her?",
  "56518": "Guilty, of course?",
  "56519": "Do you laugh, you unfeeling brute, as if you enjoyed my distress?",
  "56520": "What enjoyment is there in making love to a woman who belongs to nobody and yet belongs to any one?",
  "56521": "Have you not a word to say to me?",
  "56522": "Two drunken men, eh?",
  "56523": "What need they torture their heads with that which others have taken so strictly and so unalterably into their own purveying?",
  "56524": "What can be more natural and characteristic?",
  "56525": "Is there anything particular?",
  "56526": "What are you upset about?",
  "56527": "But the bogus inspector?",
  "56528": "And where are the children?",
  "56529": "There are then people who inhabit it?",
  "56530": "Her happiness?",
  "56531": "Please, ma'am, could I inquire if this highly instructive and charming institution is a new one?",
  "56532": "Is it not conceivable, at least, that obedience to an unselfish impulse may result even in the sacrifice of the opportunities of moral culture in general?",
  "56533": "But why not?",
  "56534": "How would they address us?",
  "56535": "Is there any thing new in this doctrine?",
  "56536": "What was she to say to him?",
  "56537": "You doubt it then?",
  "56538": "What sense is there in murdering a man in order to define one's relation to a guilty wife and son?",
  "56539": "And what are the comforts or the education which a race of beings corrupted from their infancy, and unacquainted with all the duties of life, are fitted to bestow?",
  "56540": "Then this new kind of knowledge must have an additional quality?",
  "56541": "How do you mean, bold?",
  "56542": "They taught you that?",
  "56543": "But you, critic, the reader undoubtedly will ask, what is your solution?",
  "56544": "But the heat developed by the rapidity of the projectile in crossing the strata of air?",
  "56545": "Well, are you trying to make out that I've said you have?",
  "56546": "Three days ago?",
  "56547": "What is it, a man?",
  "56548": "Whom do you think that is to?",
  "56549": "The lighted window, right up there?",

  "56553": "Who do you think should be sent there?",
  "56554": "And what for?",
  "56555": "Should he place his catastrophe as a third associate in their felicity?",
  "56556": "Can you speak, lady?",
  "56557": "Do what?",
  "56558": "That so?",
  "56559": "And you followed the business of a tailor?",
  "56560": "But how did you gain them?",
  "56561": "Whither should they go, and where should be the new seat of the mission?",
  "56562": "How does his apoplex?",
  "56563": "Ca vous amuse, la vie?",
  "56564": "You would throw over one that has stood by you this five years in favour of a man that you never saw before in your life?",
  "56565": "Ceremonies then are a subsequent thing?",
  "56566": "What can be keeping him?",
  "56567": "Why do you laugh, sir?",
  "56568": "Should she speak to her?",
  "56569": "Should she open the door or should she not?",
  "56570": "Now, while you have tyranny in so great a degree walled in, and see your enemies over your heads, to what purpose is it to take counsel?",
  "56571": "You do not know that you love me?",
  "56572": "What in thunder has that to do with you?",
  "56573": "No one at home?",
  "56574": "How is it over?",
  "56575": "Is it business?",
  "56576": "What's a ball through the chest?",
  "56577": "Has he found time to tell you scandal about me?",
  "56578": "Well how can I help it?",
  "56579": "What has our providential rescue to do with altering your feelings toward me?",
  "56580": "Where is it now, the glory and the dream?",
  "56581": "When is one pleasure twice as great as another?",
  "56582": "Is marriage so demoralising as that?",
  "56583": "Did he take any luggage?",
  "56584": "Seeing the old man?",
  "56585": "But there were three races, were there not?",
  "56586": "Was it the effect of the balmy climate alone which recalled him to health?",
  "56587": "Is it paid for?",
  "56588": "Were you speaking of me?",
  "56589": "An emancipator?",
  "56590": "These are the orders, are they?",
  "56591": "Does SHE look like the mother of six?",
  "56592": "Who is the agent?",
  "56593": "What tilbury?",
  "56594": "How can we ever thank you?",
  "56595": "Is it probable?",
  "56596": "Kitchens?",
  "56597": "And then should not the charity be all the more profound, in proportion as the fall is great?",
  "56598": "How was he to get through his present difficulty?",
  "56599": "What have you to say?",
  "56600": "You know?",
  "56601": "Is there any place at liberty that you know of now, uncle, that I should do for?",
  "56602": "But, why should I conceal my sentiments?",
  "56603": "Whom do you mean by THEY?",
  "56604": "Their graces?",
  "56605": "Shall I call him?",
  "56606": "How and why could it be mistaken?",
  "56607": "What the devil do you mean by this?",
  "56608": "If a man in selecting a residence, do not fix on one where such prevail, how can he be wise?",
  "56609": "Well, mon cher, have you got the manifesto?",
  "56610": "How, you are going soon?",
  "56611": "So saying, he fixed his eyes upon me, and asked if I had seen him tremble?",
  "56612": "But the man who was under him?",
  "56613": "Did he still cherish hope?",
  "56614": "Why funny?",
  "56615": "What have I done?",
  "56616": "Do you know much of him?",
  "56617": "Are you quite ready, gentlemen?",
  "56618": "To get what's left me sold by auction?",

  "56620": "Could he be sure that he was not their accomplice?",
  "56621": "Did the people shout at all?",
  "56622": "Excuse me,' and you believe that is sufficient?",
  "56623": "I daresay you've heard of her?",
  "56624": "Perhaps you'd care to come in and have a drink on your way?",
  "56625": "Must I receive it, or leave it in the hands of the notary?",
  "56626": "What is the meaning of that?",
  "56627": "Oh, you know him?",
  "56628": "Sir, have you finished supper?",
  "56629": "What did I get by that?",
  "56630": "What has become of the faith which has hitherto carried you so bravely through all our difficulties?",
  "56631": "Then what will you have me say?",
  "56632": "Missus's?",
  "56633": "How, then, am I mad?",
  "56634": "Could you possibly wish for a more favorable conjunction of circumstances?",
  "56635": "How should I know?",
  "56636": "What had been his object?",
  "56637": "And would that be all?",
  "56638": "Do you remember that after less than a year of married life you stood on the verge of an abyss?",
  "56639": "Why should I die, then, or basely despair?",
  "56640": "And anyone else?",
  "56641": "And what did he tell 'ee next?",
  "56642": "Do you never feel sick of it?",
  "56643": "Was this precaution or humility?",
  "56644": "Any men on it?",
  "56645": "Was it possible they heard not?",
  "56646": "Why do men halt between two opinions, and expect impossibilities?",
  "56647": "What are you wanting?",
  "56648": "Will not the good people respond to a united and earnest appeal from us?",
  "56649": "But why should I not receive her?",
  "56650": "But from whom is that letter?",
  "56651": "Have you them?",
  "56652": "What, gentlemen, is your verdict?",
  "56653": "What's a tall man unless he fight?",
  "56654": "Did that person not come back, then?",
  "56655": "Was there any other spirit but rum in the room?",
  "56656": "Do you wish to know clearly celestial matters, what they rightly are?",
  "56657": "Heavily?",
  "56658": "Do you want me to tear out my hair in handfuls?",
  "56659": "If the officer be accused of dishonesty, how shall it be made out?",
  "56660": "Where is the cure?",
  "56661": "Are you on the ground?",
  "56662": "You mentioned a fowl, I think?",
  "56663": "Upon what?",
  "56664": "Is not this an extraordinary tale?",
  "56665": "What are you meddling with my deeds for?",
  "56666": "Who is it, then, that you want to see?",
  "56667": "Is it to be yes at last?",
  "56668": "What made you think she would be here?",
  "56669": "WHO is in the room?",
  "56670": "What was there to be seen there?",
  "56671": "Was there left now nothing but to break off from the happy creative being, was the time up?",
  "56672": "You are not going out, uncle?",
  "56673": "What does it matter where it comes from?",
  "56674": "You are determined, then, to push your fortune in other lands?",
  "56675": "Why should I be ashamed of myself?",
  "56676": "And there are four of you?",
  "56677": "How will it do, how will it do?",
  "56678": "Did you see the libraries and schools!?",
  "56679": "I should like to know whether you have the same notion which I have of this study?",
  "56680": "Who is going to dress me?",
  "56681": "Think of who?",
  "56682": "What is it you want to distract you?",
  "56683": "Whose beneficence was like his?",
  "56684": "Who taught her?",
  "56685": "It was not he, then, you came to seek?",
  "56686": "Who'll have her?",
  "56687": "Did you speak to him?",
  "56688": "Have you seen fifty frightful men pass down from the cliffs into this forest, my children?",
  "56689": "Will your ladyship stay the night?",
  "56690": "What can he be picking up?",
  "56691": "Then why on earth does she do it?",
  "56692": "How could this be, sir?",
  "56693": "Shall I tell you why?",
  "56694": "What is the day of the month?",
  "56695": "What shall become of me?",
  "56696": "Well, have you made up your mind to this journey?",
  "56697": "And him you found?",
  "56698": "Did he get his brain fever, and then write all those terrible things, or had he some cause for it all?",
  "56699": "Was she young?",
  "56700": "Cosette?",
  "56701": "Have you seen?",
  "56702": "Where shall we go?",
  "56703": "Or what is this?",
  "56704": "Have you, indeed, my boy?",
  "56705": "Have you seen the general?",
  "56706": "But how should they know when the projectile had reached this neutral point situated at that distance, especially when neither themselves, nor the objects enclosed in the projectile, would be any longer subject to the laws of weight?",
  "56707": "What have you been doing during my absence?",
  "56708": "To you, eh?",
  "56709": "But can the musician by his art make men unmusical?",
  "56710": "Yet, when the sensibility is thus increased at the expense of reason, and even the imagination, why do philosophical men complain of their fickleness?",
  "56711": "Am I to suppose that you intend to lower yourself by marrying a young woman who cannot possibly have enjoyed any of the advantages of a lady's education?",
  "56712": "Well, and your guardian must be brave if he is to fight well?",
  "56713": "Has my girl any objection?",
  "56714": "Now, when the restriction is removed, what is to prevent it from going still farther?",
  "56715": "But, I say, do you make any progress in it?",
  "56716": "But who should less expect from you?",
  "56717": "I would have you consider seriously of it?",
  "56718": "And what money 'ud he want?",
  "56719": "What would you have, sir?",

  "56721": "Yet if he is not the maker, what is he in relation to the bed?",
  "56722": "Of complexion and brown hair?",
  "56723": "Have they contributed to encourage the diligence, and to improve the abilities, of the teachers?",
  "56724": "What about marriage?",
  "56725": "My friend, whom, then, will you serve?",
  "56726": "How is it that justice and isolation always accompany each other?",
  "56727": "And how is it to be parried?",

  "56730": "Rob?",
  "56731": "So there is a hole?",
  "56732": "Why pay rent?",
  "56733": "Should he try to catch her eye, and then raise his hat?",
  "56734": "The first question is, whether music is or is not to make a part of education?",
  "56735": "Will you do me the favor to explain this enigma to me?",
  "56736": "Is there any other point which you would like to ask about?",
  "56737": "The bed might have been let down by some artificial means?",
  "56738": "But what are you up to?",
  "56739": "But what about you, and the rowing?",
  "56740": "May I have a grill for dinner?",
  "56741": "What need he add to such a desperate proof in figures?",
  "56742": "Did you promise to marry her?",
  "56743": "Did you speculate any more?",
  "56744": "What, let me ask, is a man in and of himself?",
  "56745": "Why so much beating about the bush?",
  "56746": "Or am I not to know?",
  "56747": "What does your chamber open on?",
  "56748": "Come to where four roads meet?",
  "56749": "What's this round your neck?",
  "56750": "And which?",
  "56751": "Why do you want to do that at this particular time, when at every previous time that I have proposed it you have refused?",
  "56752": "What gallows?",
  "56753": "Do you think you can help me, dear grandpapa?",
  "56754": "Why do you sit out here all alone?",
  "56755": "O why was that so?",
  "56756": "You know what they say of my lodger?",
  "56757": "But if he gives you?",
  "56758": "What money is this?",
  "56759": "And would it be indiscreet to ask you the name of this powerful protector?",
  "56760": "I beg your pardon?",
  "56761": "What do you call liberty, monsieur?",
  "56762": "You'll mention that I called, perhaps?",
  "56763": "You notice my ring?",

  "56768": "Are those horrid creatures gone?",
  "56769": "Why does he then exceed all bounds at once?",
  "56770": "How are you sure?",
  "56771": "Does any one live, who knows what set purposes you have, half as well as I do?",
  "56772": "Could it be that these were four words, and that they were intended to carry a message to me?",
  "56773": "There is nothing you desire?",
  "56774": "Will you let me make the tea?",
  "56775": "What else did he say to you?",
  "56776": "What is there in all that for me to think about?",
  "56777": "By pulling out a bar and pushing down a door?",
  "56778": "Aye?",
  "56779": "Well, miss?",
  "56780": "But what was to be done?",
  "56781": "Was the projectile under some foreign influence?",
  "56782": "Will you begin, if you please, and put in the thatch again, just as if you were doing it for your mother's cabin?",
  "56783": "Shall we not set forth?",
  "56784": "Do you, sir?",
  "56785": "Do you think this does?",
  "56786": "Do you think you could hustle something in the way of a little lunch, old man?",
  "56787": "What could this NN be?",
  "56788": "And how did he behave, madam?",
  "56789": "How much do you require for my ransom?",
  "56790": "If the possibility of passing the limits of experience be admitted, by means of the dynamical law of the relation of an effect to its cause, what kind of conception shall we obtain by this procedure?",
  "56791": "But are your relatives so very poor?",
  "56792": "What is all this dancing up and down?",
  "56793": "If all were only vanity, who would mind it?",
  "56794": "Would I not give my life to secure it?",
  "56795": "But will his warriors consent?",
  "56796": "Why then should you expect me to pen this kind of affidavit, which has no object but to keep up a foolish partiality and secure a foolish bequest?",
  "56797": "But how did you proceed?",
  "56798": "What was it placed there for?",
  "56799": "Are YOU there?",
  "56800": "Or perhaps it is the pale morning light which takes your colour away?",
  "56801": "Why did you not bring it at once?",
  "56802": "The messenger that brought it, said would you be so good as read it by my lantern?",
  "56803": "If anyone arrives in my absence, do the honors for me, will you not?",
  "56804": "Has the breakfast been all right?",
  "56805": "Of what day?",
  "56806": "Has anyone?",
  "56807": "I trust you are in good health, and that your families are all well?",

  "56809": "Well, what now?",
  "56810": "Think?",
  "56811": "And the youth repented, and became a good man?",
  "56812": "He rends defenseless women and little children in his lair, but how recently has one of you seen him fight with men?",
  "56813": "Pray, what may that portmanteau of yours weigh?",
  "56814": "You'll be sure to be stirring early and go with us?",
  "56815": "Will it be possible to draw water here tonight?",
  "56816": "Are any of the gallants within?",
  "56817": "Well, then, what do you make of your word AUSTRA?",

  "56822": "Could they go to the corral in this dark night?",
  "56823": "Should he treat it as belonging to him?",
  "56824": "Will he succeed in his purpose?",
  "56825": "Oh, how could you act so?",
  "56826": "And yet, he said, the number two is certainly not opposed to the number three?",
  "56827": "No lands neither?",
  "56828": "What were horses made for, if not to drag people uphill?",
  "56829": "In which of your characters, sir, will you give us leave to address you?",
  "56830": "Why have you thrown that away?",
  "56831": "Dead?",
  "56832": "Will you never correct yourself of that vile habit?",
  "56833": "And what did you think, sir, of what I said?",
  "56834": "What, then, it may be asked, is the good of being great?",
  "56835": "Is it not clear that your duty is to oppose the former to the latter, and thus, by the argument of contradiction, drive privilege into its last ditch?",
  "56836": "I wonder which craft I shall get?",
  "56837": "You promise?",
  "56838": "Not so much as out of bed?",
  "56839": "What's the good of tormenting him like this?",
  "56840": "What do you think of that?",
  "56841": "Can you not do anything you wish?",
  "56842": "But how were you to benefit?",
  "56843": "Rinaldo, why still so pensive?",
  "56844": "What can I do for you?",
  "56845": "What have I done to need his forgiveness?",

  "56856": "Peace?",
  "56857": "What work are you about now?",
  "56858": "Would not his hearers add to that sum?",
  "56859": "But passion for him?",
  "56860": "Who is he?",
  "56861": "Does your feminine tyranny require that when you say the thing you mean is one of several things, I should know it immediately by that mark?",
  "56862": "In what condition of mind were you?",
  "56863": "Is it like that, dad?",
  "56864": "And how the devil did you come to fasten me out, you toothless hound?",
  "56865": "Spell it?",
  "56866": "How did I give it?",
  "56867": "What do you want with twenty sons?",

  "56881": "Are you engaged to that painter?",
  "56882": "I've convinced you it's impossible?",
  "56883": "Is it to lead us prisoners to the woods, or do you contemplate even some greater evil?",
  "56884": "Did not I work that waistcoat to make you genteel?",
  "56885": "And why is it impossible?",
  "56886": "What became of these men?",
  "56887": "Shall we shut the door, and lock it, or not?",

  "56930": "What have you in common with him?",
  "56931": "Can the mercy which they have exercised even in the fury of battle be extinct in their hearts?",
  "56932": "Now shall we go home?",
  "56933": "A scandal, is it not?",
  "56934": "Will you come?",

  "56951": "Have you any one to go on your bond?",
  "56952": "What joy is that?",
  "56953": "Something to soften down that harsh judgment?",
  "56954": "At all events tell me whether he slept at home last night, and whether he came alone?",
  "56955": "Then you will start after the queen?",
  "56956": "And was it a lie that you told me?",
  "56957": "Was it because I hate you and have hated you all my life?",
  "56958": "Is it a demon?",
  "56959": "I hope you like them?",
  "56960": "Afraid?",
  "56961": "Are we going to be friends after this?",
  "56962": "Well, what shall we do, darling?",
  "56963": "Never could discover?",
  "56964": "What rest?",
  "56965": "What matter, madam?",
  "56966": "Can such, by any human ingenuity, be moulded into anything resembling an orderly community?",
  "56967": "Was that all?",
  "56968": "And should anyone in any case be content that his oath shall go unkept on a merely unsubstantial controversy as to how it shall be kept?",
  "56969": "What good would that do?",
  "56970": "Have you another passenger?",
  "56971": "What made 'ee ask that?",
  "56972": "For what period of time?",
  "56973": "What would become of me if I should do such a thing?",
  "56974": "When once in the bay, would she anchor there?",
  "56975": "And how, lower down still?",
  "56976": "What fine chisel could ever yet cut breath?",
  "56977": "Ah, why were you not there, gentlemen?",

  "56980": "Wherein is a victory more valuable by your plan than mine?",
  "56981": "Where do you get your money?",
  "56982": "At this dingle dangle wagging of my tub, what would you have me to do?",
  "56983": "What would the boys say if they could see us?",
  "56984": "Nothing else smart?",
  "56985": "What is yours?",
  "56986": "Now, then, you want to warn me?",
  "56987": "If atoms are indivisible and impenetrable, why does not their association, confined to mechanical effects, leave them unchanged in essence?",
  "56988": "Will you be good enough to follow us?",
  "56989": "But what are you doing?",
  "56990": "I believe it was settled you should meet me?",
  "56991": "Then, what clue could you have as to his identity?",
  "56992": "Any you will submit to the reparation he may require?",
  "56993": "Why did you signal to stop?",
  "56994": "And when you used to tell the stories?",
  "56995": "You saw that?",
  "56996": "Do you pretend you had any right to make professions of love to her, even if you had been a fit husband for her, when neither her father nor your father would ever consent to a marriage between you?",
  "56997": "What's this I see?",
  "56998": "And you will not be annoyed if I tell you the plain truth?",
  "56999": "And how much do you suppose that he understood of it?",
  "57000": "And things great and small, heavy and light, as they are termed, will not be denoted by these any more than by the opposite names?",
  "57001": "Come, shall we turn round?",
  "57002": "Did the cavern which the settlers were now exploring extend to the center of the island?",
  "57003": "Do you mean because we're in my wife's brougham?",
  "57004": "Is that how you look after things?",
  "57005": "What had become of her?",
  "57006": "To this I am willing, but is there none amongst us who has a better right?",
  "57007": "First floor?",
  "57008": "Then, what, sir, if I should convince you to your face of my sincerity?",
  "57009": "Why, what shall I learn?",
  "57010": "But what's to be done?",
  "57011": "And how is my father?",
  "57012": "Ah?",
  "57013": "And, to conclude the matter, what is even an eternal remembrance?",
  "57014": "Could I be mistaken?",
  "57015": "But why, sir?",
  "57016": "And what his cause of grief?",
  "57017": "Is it so?",
  "57018": "Do they, sir?",
  "57019": "Why should you be thus scrupulous, pray you, sir?",
  "57020": "Then, sire, may I present him?",
  "57021": "Yes, giant's horses you must have, must you not?",
  "57022": "Have we come to any?",
  "57023": "What do you assure me?",
  "57024": "Do you believe in spiritualism?",
  "57025": "And wherefore do you hate him?",
  "57026": "What is imagination?",
  "57027": "Nay, none?",
  "57028": "Where does the window of that look out to?",
  "57029": "And sack my stable?",
  "57030": "Like what, sir, eh?",
  "57031": "Could she still draw back after all he had done for her?",
  "57032": "For ought you not then immediately to be beaten and trampled on, bidding me sing, just as if you were entertaining cicadae?",
  "57033": "Shall I complain of him?",
  "57034": "What in the name of the devil is this thing?",
  "57035": "Ah, whither did my noblest vow then flee?",
  "57036": "Do you know this ring?",
  "57037": "Some THING or someone?",
  "57038": "D'you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled them ever since I was a nipper?",
  "57039": "Would they be able to find a place to land, or would they go hurtling down into some awful crater, or be dashed upon the sharp peak of some mountain of the moon?",
  "57040": "But what was his business?",
  "57041": "But knowing the scheme they had planned, why should he offer to assist it?",
  "57042": "Might it not have been a long time already on the coast of the island?",
  "57043": "May I make bold to trouble your honor?",
  "57044": "Vouchsafe me, by whom, good captain?",
  "57045": "You are detectives, I suppose?",
  "57046": "Well, do you recognize your little madcap playmate?",
  "57047": "May I go at once?",
  "57048": "You're still at the same work, then?",
  "57049": "Did he have fine horses?",
  "57050": "Why, gentlemen?",
  "57051": "Whatever I had to do, I always did it eagerly and with all my heart, did I not?",
  "57052": "Perhaps you can think of something more exciting than about the donkey, eh?",
  "57053": "Show it me, will you?",
  "57054": "You have found the castaway?",
  "57055": "How are you getting on?",
  "57056": "Did he get all right?",
  "57057": "But how are you going to get it?",
  "57058": "How can I express it?",
  "57059": "Do you think my husband was too much inclined to welcome you?",
  "57060": "No bad thing, eh?",
  "57061": "This being so, how is it that, ever since the establishment of this balance, inequality has been on the increase?",
  "57062": "Do you know what is in this letter?",
  "57063": "Do you suppose he can possibly recover?",
  "57064": "I wished to have, what?",
  "57065": "Nobody did?",
  "57066": "As you have been the bearer of the bishop's letter to me, I am bound to ask whether I shall be indebted to you for carrying back my reply, or whether I shall send it by course of post?",

  "57068": "What is his sorrow?",
  "57069": "How should we meet discriminations on railways and in hotels?",
  "57070": "Something to drink?",
  "57071": "How old could she be?",
  "57072": "Who ever heard of such a thing?",
  "57073": "Is not my heart like a glass house, into which you can all look, to convince yourselves that it is a soil wholly unfruitful, and that not a single poor little flower grows there?",
  "57074": "Do you love it?",
  "57075": "But how do you come to be doing this?",
  "57076": "How about poison?",
  "57077": "Will they meet?",
  "57078": "Have I made you no returns?",
  "57079": "Anything remarkable on hand?",
  "57080": "Where is the promise of amendment, for which I should forgive you?",
  "57081": "How many of them remain?",

  "57084": "What's to be done with him?",
  "57085": "Who was turning it?",
  "57086": "Notice what things?",
  "57087": "How much is there there?",
  "57088": "What do we want the men and women who work with us to say when we are no longer there?",
  "57089": "And was my father furtherer of their deaths?",
  "57090": "For why should be not be great and famous?",
  "57091": "What do you wish?",
  "57092": "What the deuce is he knocking at his own door for?",
  "57093": "For if not, why he hurry so?",
  "57094": "How did you come by that?",
  "57095": "Am I to take from you then that you accept and recognise my knowledge?",
  "57096": "Does he mean, by this decoration, a figurative or a real golden chain?",
  "57097": "Will you follow the bearer, and see once again the outcast whom all the rest of the world will shun?",
  "57098": "Our great relation?",
  "57099": "And how?",
  "57100": "A nice bowl of gruel?",
  "57101": "Young?",

  "57119": "And supposing he were to do this several times under the heat of a scorching sun, might he not, being an expert, overturn more than one stout personage?",
  "57120": "And what had been his conduct in that country?",
  "57121": "Where are they going?",
  "57122": "Have these historians of hearts and souls duties at all inferior to the historians of external facts?",

  "57134": "What business is that of yours?",
  "57135": "And now, mamma, what answer do you think we ought to send to his letter?",
  "57136": "Do you ASK me?",
  "57137": "How do you welcome your wanderer?",

  "57247": "But which of vs is to performe that part?",
  "57248": "Why should she have been so reticent at the time of the tragedy?",
  "57249": "Or might it suffice him that every wholesome growth should be converted into something deleterious and malignant at his touch?",
  "57250": "And why did she resist her seducer when she loved him?",

  "57331": "Why do you conduct yourself in this fashion toward me?",
  "57332": "You do not fear that the illness will return?",
  "57333": "And you would also acknowledge that the enchanted are those who change their minds either under the softer influence of pleasure, or the sterner influence of fear?",
  "57334": "Who can so minister to the inherent, perhaps barbaric remnant, love for display?",
  "57335": "Must it go in?",
  "57336": "Have I welcomed a traitor?",
  "57337": "Will you change your mind now, you blockhead?",
  "57338": "You advertised, I believe, for a salesman?",
  "57339": "Do you play on the guitar?",
  "57340": "Where should they be housed?",
  "57341": "Into the court, sir?",
  "57342": "But why need I go farther?",
  "57343": "Do you realise, father, that I've never had the least blow?",
  "57344": "And pray has he done so?",
  "57345": "How long since utility became a principle of law?",
  "57346": "Are they nice apples?",
  "57347": "Cannot I have this one night with you?",
  "57348": "Where meantime was the hapless owner of this wreck?",
  "57349": "What do you mean, my good fellow?",
  "57350": "How far do the cases differ in principle?",
  "57351": "Is it there or not?",
  "57352": "Visiting a sweetheart?",
  "57353": "Is it wrong to watch them?",
  "57354": "Begin to break her, like a poor caged bird, and wear her deluded life away, in teaching her to sing YOUR notes?",
  "57355": "What is our name?",
  "57356": "You are doubtless provided with pistols, gentlemen?",
  "57357": "What sins have we done?",
  "57358": "Did you never observe how imitations, beginning in early youth and continuing far into life, at length grow into habits and become a second nature, affecting body, voice, and mind?",
  "57359": "Help him?",
  "57360": "Could he throw no light?",
  "57361": "And what was the result?",
  "57362": "Well, how have you been?",
  "57363": "Why is not all this real?",
  "57364": "But how could he go away, leaving me in such a state?",
  "57365": "What became of her?",
  "57366": "Did she not always expect it?",
  "57367": "The husband?",
  "57368": "For the question still recurs, what motive first produces those instances of submission, which we imitate, and that train of actions, which produces the custom?",
  "57369": "Why did he ever forget it?",
  "57370": "How do you know what men would fall in love with?",
  "57371": "How do you know but that it hurts a geranium's feelings just to be called a geranium and nothing else?",
  "57372": "Did the person wish to smoke?",
  "57373": "Was it a bacchanalia?",
  "57374": "And what do you decide upon now, my lady?",
  "57375": "Well and when the money's gone, what then?",
  "57376": "Do you like that better?",
  "57377": "How did you get such huge huge hands?",
  "57378": "Who were the persons in whom he placed the greatest confidence, and who took the warmest interest in his schemes?",
  "57379": "I was going to say, the will to be interested in him has died, and what else matters?",
  "57380": "Are you satisfied now?",
  "57381": "My goodness, what utter twaddle, and what may all this nonsense have signified, pray?",
  "57382": "Of what must I repent?",
  "57383": "Surely not to throw yourself into the river?",
  "57384": "But of what use is it to fatigue myself with vain words?",
  "57385": "Then we may assume that our athletes will be able to fight with two or three times their own number?",
  "57386": "The philanthropist?",
  "57387": "Why, are they after him yet?",
  "57388": "And will he not, from his own interest in that species of property, be sufficiently prone to resist every attempt to prejudice or encumber it?",
  "57389": "Pet name props?",
  "57390": "And she kept her word?",
  "57391": "And what was the true measurement of the new little world?",
  "57392": "Why are they the happiest?",
  "57393": "Yes, my friend, but if so, when do we lose them?",
  "57394": "Can he not hold his water at reading of a ballad?",
  "57395": "I suppose you're very glad to go?",
  "57396": "What can he want with me?",
  "57397": "What have you been doing here?",
  "57398": "And if it departed how could it move unless it went upwards?",
  "57399": "What could he do else that would have been of the smallest use to her?",
  "57400": "But is there capital punishment where you were?",
  "57401": "Do we stop here?",
  "57402": "How many are they?",
  "57403": "Is it really?",
  "57404": "So that you were at rest?",
  "57405": "A little or much?",
  "57406": "Who then?",
  "57407": "Are you stupid?",
  "57408": "And what's your name?",
  "57409": "But how could I help it?",
  "57410": "Did she die very soon?",
  "57411": "Do you want me to adjudicate that too?",
  "57412": "What is that to me?",
  "57413": "Perhaps you never before noticed him?",
  "57414": "Why is it, I say, that you are thus agitated in relation to the domestic affairs of other communities?",
  "57415": "How can you talk so?",
  "57416": "Who told you that they have never done so?",
  "57417": "Have you got a sledge?",
  "57418": "Police, sir?",
  "57419": "But come whither?",
  "57420": "Then I have received a merely legitimate salary, in spite of the opinion of my confessor?",
  "57421": "But where was the novelty?",
  "57422": "Where is your wife, in the first place?",
  "57423": "And where did the dream come from?",
  "57424": "And what shall I do if you desert me?",
  "57425": "How, nowhere?",
  "57426": "Do you know what we are eating here?",
  "57427": "Yes, but how much?",
  "57428": "Grow pale, fear, calculate?",
  "57429": "Go on the stage?",
  "57430": "Wood?",
  "57431": "What are my heart's experiences?",
  "57432": "What is the ego?",
  "57433": "And how much did she give you for this fine enterprise?",
  "57434": "Was there no means of calming this angry sea?",
  "57435": "What did he say to that?",
  "57436": "Do about you?",
  "57437": "What's the sense of it?",
  "57438": "Where is the guilty party here?",
  "57439": "And what happened to him afterwards?",
  "57440": "Is it a duty to postpone everything to a sense of injuries, and wrong to gratify a mother in a request like this?",
  "57441": "What will you do?",
  "57442": "Anything else, my lord?",
  "57443": "Dear mother, are you so resolved?",
  "57444": "But she is proud, is she not?",
  "57445": "But what does the thermometer say?",
  "57446": "Can you ask that question?",
  "57447": "What's become of them, the dear fellows?",
  "57448": "Why are you travelling?",
  "57449": "How should they use it?",
  "57450": "Does he speak to you of this conspiracy?",
  "57451": "And was SHE married?",
  "57452": "You left your door open?",
  "57453": "Is there danger of another?",
  "57454": "What had her infancy been?",
  "57455": "How much money have you left?",
  "57456": "What is the matter?",
  "57457": "But what were you going to say?",
  "57458": "She is no relation of his?",
  "57459": "What hard fortune brought us here?",
  "57460": "What if she were so called?",
  "57461": "In other words, should strict impartiality be aimed at?",
  "57462": "And what did he offer?",
  "57463": "Why not go and try to get speech of him and beg for justice?",
  "57464": "What shall you do in life?",
  "57465": "Was not that nearly what you said?",
  "57466": "Is not this a free country?",
  "57467": "Which of these will be mine?",
  "57468": "How did you happen to be taken to a hospital?",
  "57469": "What is it?",
  "57470": "I brought it to the table near the fire, and asked him what he would have?",
  "57471": "Do you remember what you told me once, about her making all the apple parsties and doing all the cooking?",
  "57472": "Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind?",
  "57473": "Does this prove that ignorance and dependence domesticate them?",
  "57474": "Why do you not see this?",
  "57475": "What is it makes the wolves to leave the woods?",
  "57476": "It is useless?",
  "57477": "Mad, is he?",
  "57478": "Is it a pure a priori, or is it an empirical intuition?",
  "57479": "Why does it not encourage its citizens to put out its faults, and do better than it would have them?",
  "57480": "Have you told them where to find me?",
  "57481": "Where, then, is the ship?",
  "57482": "I'm not very exacting, am I?",
  "57483": "And in what state of mind has he returned to you?",
  "57484": "What was it that he did?",
  "57485": "Well, then, tell us frankly, what do you think of her personal appearance?",
  "57486": "Why, for example, should the king of a primitive community be prohibited from sleeping lying down?",
  "57487": "Where am I to join on?",
  "57488": "What right have you to bid me leave this house, sir?",
  "57489": "Who would endure this for many lives?",
  "57490": "Which is best off?",
  "57491": "Tell me, where is the place that men call hell?",
  "57492": "Then will she die too?",
  "57493": "Need it be said that no such measures could destroy that tendency?",
  "57494": "Well as he knew how to resolve characters into their elements, would he have been able to combine those elements in such a manner as to make up a man, a real, living, individual man?",
  "57495": "Od's precious, come away, man, what do you mean?",
  "57496": "May I go and help carry the things to the poor little children?",
  "57497": "Have heard them say that there is nothing pleasanter than to get rid of their pain?",
  "57498": "Who could see?",
  "57499": "Have you any more to stake?",
  "57500": "What shall you tell her?",
  "57501": "What like is he?",
  "57502": "Is this of envy or no?",
  "57503": "Why, WHY do they torment me and say I am going to marry you?",
  "57504": "If I went to sleep as I proposed, how could the atmosphere in the chamber be regenerated in the interim?",
  "57505": "I suppose you have searched her desk and things?",
  "57506": "What, after all, was this new oath?",
  "57507": "What then are we to conclude from these facts and considerations?",
  "57508": "How might it fare more gently with you in all the world?",
  "57509": "What avarice?",
  "57510": "Hurt me?",
  "57511": "Who's not playing fair?",
  "57512": "They were none of them among our friends at the lodge, then?",
  "57513": "Has it been so kept?",
  "57514": "So you are going away in the fall?",
  "57515": "In the flesh?",
  "57516": "Where is my wife?",
  "57517": "And had he married the valiant matron's daughter, as he promised?",
  "57518": "Whatcher take me for, hey?",
  "57519": "What do you mean, the rabbit?",
  "57520": "Now what do you say?",
  "57521": "And what sort of men do they graduate?",
  "57522": "He knew then?",
  "57523": "What was she insolent about?",
  "57524": "Do you not see his heart is fast breaking?",
  "57525": "Can this be possible, uncle?",
  "57526": "Why should they?",
  "57527": "Have you forgotten the day?",
  "57528": "Do you see anything there?",
  "57529": "What is the object of this assembly?",
  "57530": "Good heavens, are you ill?",
  "57531": "Well, did you dig up the watch?",
  "57532": "You will arrest him?",
  "57533": "What uncanny secret did it hold?",
  "57534": "Why is she thus possessed, and why does she not spare herself?",
  "57535": "At any rate, you have some walks in the neighbourhood?",
  "57536": "You have been a soldier?",
  "57537": "But why a year?",
  "57538": "Who's that laughing at me?",
  "57539": "Where, then, would have been her navy, her trade and even her existence?",
  "57540": "What do you hear from your mother?",
  "57541": "How could I settle the point forever?",
  "57542": "What does that spell?",
  "57543": "He means to marry you?",
  "57544": "But would that be necessary?",
  "57545": "What did happen?",
  "57546": "Is the shepherd said to be just to his sheep and his dogs?",
  "57547": "Why do you keep the secrets of that man, when they mean death to so many?",
  "57548": "But if I pursue and nothing gain, what will it profit me to come up with him?",
  "57549": "Do you wish to get out?",
  "57550": "Clara, are you ready to come home?",
  "57551": "Did you ever hear of such ingratitude?",
  "57552": "The best school?",
  "57553": "Bread?",
  "57554": "Dare they to hope a poet for their friend?",
  "57555": "What do I deduce from this?",
  "57556": "When did that person come here, waiter?",
  "57557": "What has made you so disobedient and unfaithful?",
  "57558": "You're not in bed?",
  "57559": "What spot?",
  "57560": "What would become of this assertion, if, assuming in my turn the offensive, I should demonstrate that belief in the existence of bodies, or, in other words, in the reality of a purely corporeal nature, is untenable?",
  "57561": "Did he believe?",
  "57562": "And now, is this all you have to tell me?",
  "57563": "Could he forego the renown of being the first wit of his age?",
  "57564": "What was he hoping for?",
  "57565": "What name am I to say?",
  "57566": "Elm or fir, both of which abounded in the island?",
  "57567": "And why will they not?",
  "57568": "A new one?",
  "57569": "What if you should die first?",
  "57570": "As day by day the sun sank lower and lower in the sky, could he be certain that the luminary would ever retrace his heavenly road?",
  "57571": "Had they nothing else to say to one another?",
  "57572": "Who told you to steal?",
  "57573": "Did I not tell you how quick and resolute she was?",
  "57574": "Is there any example of an individual object that escaped the government of that law in the whole history of the world?",
  "57575": "Why tarry ye?",
  "57576": "Did he give a reason?",
  "57577": "How did you come here?",
  "57578": "Did I break through one of your rings, that you spread that damned ice on the causeway?",
  "57579": "He asked himself, or were they playing a part?",
  "57580": "Is it true that my mind is only a harmony, and my soul a vortex?",
  "57581": "But if I do fight, you will surely not object to giving me a lesson or two in shooting and fencing?",
  "57582": "Are we women?",
  "57583": "Have you more to say?",
  "57584": "What had really happened?",
  "57585": "For what is there more prompt, more unexpected, more abbreviatory of space and time, than the maturity of an obligation?",
  "57586": "Would they be right in the future?",
  "57587": "And what do you say is your surmise as to your present position?",
  "57588": "Suppose now I ask, why I rather than anybody else?",
  "57589": "If what?",
  "57590": "Have you a heart?",
  "57591": "With me?",
  "57592": "Did you ever hear of such an idea?",
  "57593": "Have you quite forgotten her?",
  "57594": "So you are good enough to pass my appearance?",
  "57595": "Is it tobacco?",
  "57596": "I ask you what can I do?",
  "57597": "Could it have been an early hornet?",
  "57598": "Who is that?",
  "57599": "Can you drink anything?",
  "57600": "Why not pursue an end confessedly good by peaceable and regular means?",
  "57601": "Did he come to arrest me?",
  "57602": "Whither so fast, child?",
  "57603": "Ah, why will you not unseal my lips?",
  "57604": "Does this look like confidence?",
  "57605": "Has it gone well?",
  "57606": "Admires the jay the insect's gilded wings?",
  "57607": "And did they often get a chance to do that?",
  "57608": "And do I love?",
  "57609": "UNDER THE CROSS,' hey?",
  "57610": "What did you look at, so fixedly?",
  "57611": "Why stop?",
  "57612": "And of what are you so sure?",
  "57613": "And the friend he regards and describes as one in whom he has an interest, and the other as a stranger in whom he has no interest?",
  "57614": "For all that, are not our dresses as beautiful as yours?",
  "57615": "Why are they fighting?",
  "57616": "Is the danger you apprehended last night gone by now, sir?",
  "57617": "When the winds blow and the seas flow?",
  "57618": "Do you call this acting the part of a man and a gentleman, sir?",
  "57619": "Why should not I eat birds?",
  "57620": "A slap in the face?",
  "57621": "What have you to do with our independence?",
  "57622": "Are you sure you can get 'em out of their fix?",
  "57623": "What principle directed it?",
  "57624": "Besides, why should I say anything about it to him?",
  "57625": "How did you get this passport?",
  "57626": "The house is sold, then?",
  "57627": "What kind of person is she?",
  "57628": "Did he hear me?",
  "57629": "You were his constant companion, then?",
  "57630": "Is it not rather an appeal to the proprietory instinct, the COMMERCIAL instinct?",
  "57631": "Is that true, mother?",
  "57632": "How once?",
  "57633": "When an establishment has had the leisure to develop itself, enlarge its foundations, ballast itself with capital, and assure itself a body of patrons, what can the workman who has only his arms do against a power so superior?",
  "57634": "Well, and what does it signify whether it was he or I?",
  "57635": "What formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward?",
  "57636": "Would it be believed, that when near nineteen, any one could be so stupid as to build his hopes of future subsistence on an empty phial?",
  "57637": "For what?",
  "57638": "Is not this absurd?",
  "57639": "Do you know that I am to be beheaded outside this window?",
  "57640": "Eh, who's there?",
  "57641": "How many a year, did you say?",
  "57642": "You intend to show off your intelligence, I suppose?",
  "57643": "Did you want me?",
  "57644": "What are you talking about, man?",
  "57645": "Is it possible that even now, when I give you these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?",
  "57646": "But where were you going, when you met us?",
  "57647": "D'Artagnan?",
  "57648": "I wonder where I shall be this time tomorrow?",
  "57649": "Taenarum?",
  "57650": "Cannot you understand that the time it takes to wink is a whole eternity if it severs me from the beauty of your face?",
  "57651": "Tomorrow, then, sire?",
  "57652": "And who are you?",
  "57653": "What did ye?",
  "57654": "Did you put out the lamp?",
  "57655": "How long would it last?",
  "57656": "Who is still to come?",
  "57657": "Should he abandon this man?",
  "57658": "How about the others?",
  "57659": "Has he brought his brig with him?",
  "57660": "And what are my instructions?",
  "57661": "To make that reply and then perish, what could be grander?",
  "57662": "Why do I?",
  "57663": "Where are we living?",
  "57664": "Would you like me to come with you now?",
  "57665": "Can you already understand?",
  "57666": "Were they in the front or in the rear of their generation?",
  "57667": "How could I be otherwise?",
  "57668": "On the contrary, but what dignity?",
  "57669": "Just now, but refrained out of politeness ?",
  "57670": "Are you trying to hide?",
  "57671": "Is the vicar in?",
  "57672": "How can you say such a thing?",
  "57673": "A secret?",
  "57674": "Did you want the carpenter, sir?",
  "57675": "Then why are you always alone in your room these days?",
  "57676": "Got shot?",
  "57677": "Who makes the waters flow?",
  "57678": "More money, I suppose?",
  "57679": "About you?",
  "57680": "You will be staying on here, I suppose?",
  "57681": "It is you who set out seven or eight months ago from your country to seek your fortune in the capital?",
  "57682": "Where's your uncle?",
  "57683": "Who in the world cares for YOU?",
  "57684": "Was it real, or only apparent?",
  "57685": "What is the difficulty?",
  "57686": "WHAT doth all the world know at present?",
  "57687": "Is there no ford?",
  "57688": "How came it to pass?",
  "57689": "Are you willing?",
  "57690": "Done with their buttons?",
  "57691": "Av you anything to say agen it?",
  "57692": "Could it have been a slight quivering of the nostrils that he had seen, or was it mad fancy playing a trick on him?",
  "57693": "Would it comfort, or would it wound you to have a similar painting?",
  "57694": "Who is in command here?",
  "57695": "Will you let me see you home?",
  "57696": "Will you take charge of the letter?",
  "57697": "Should not all that be eternal?",
  "57698": "But why prove that to me?",
  "57699": "And its aim is?",
  "57700": "What could be the meaning of such a change?",
  "57701": "Have there been any fresh developments?",
  "57702": "What are you about?",
  "57703": "I am to live at home?",
  "57704": "What joy would they have to bring hanging to the likes of me?",
  "57705": "Where did she go?",
  "57706": "But may I, mamma?",
  "57707": "And who are hearsed that die on the sea?",
  "57708": "How have you got here?",
  "57709": "How long has he left it?",
  "57710": "And whither am I to go?",
  "57711": "Now, from whom could these pages come?",
  "57712": "You will then be at my service?",
  "57713": "And pray, sir, what in the world is equal to it?",
  "57714": "Could it be that there should be happiness in store for her?",
  "57715": "And what would that be, think you?",
  "57716": "In whose name do you come?",
  "57717": "Why not have let me speak to you, above there, where it is light, and there is something stirring, instead of bringing us to this dark and dismal hole?",
  "57718": "Where is my hat?",
  "57719": "But we'll gie 'em another song?",
  "57720": "Yet could I, in justice, or even in possibility, refuse this demand?",
  "57721": "What is the meaning of this?",
  "57722": "Will your majesty permit me to tell you the truth?",
  "57723": "Whatever can be the matter?",
  "57724": "Had the cooling of the globe produced it?",
  "57725": "Are you and your party ready?",
  "57726": "Doubt?",
  "57727": "To whom do I surrender?",
  "57728": "Why, where have you seen her?",
  "57729": "Where have you hid him?",
  "57730": "Well, are you off to the front?",
  "57731": "Oh, is that so?",
  "57732": "Why should we give it?",
  "57733": "He asked me if I felt sure that I was as well as in the morning?",
  "57734": "Please will your grandfather lend us his fuelhouse to try over our parts in, tonight at seven o'clock?",
  "57735": "Well, what is it perplexes me?",
  "57736": "Is your honour mad?",
  "57737": "This dial with movable needle is a manometer, is it not?",
  "57738": "How could these men, who never had the faintest idea of statistics, valuation, or political economy, furnish us with principles of legislation?",
  "57739": "And how's it you're not afraid, sir, really now?",
  "57740": "This?",
  "57741": "Are you going to walk out with us after lunch?",
  "57742": "Have you been in it since your adventure?",
  "57743": "Wife with you?",
  "57744": "Why do you keep looking at me like that?",
  "57745": "Did he reject her eternally, or did he not?",
  "57746": "Will you not honor us by telling us who you are?",
  "57747": "Whom have you come from?",
  "57748": "Have you noticed these flowers?",
  "57749": "How much brandy may I drink?",
  "57750": "But what does it matter, now it's all over?",
  "57751": "Who will bring up my children?",
  "57752": "But why should we wish to escape?",
  "57753": "Tell her?",
  "57754": "Has he no father or mother, or uncles or aunts?",
  "57755": "Interested, are you?",
  "57756": "If I'm as good as good can be all day tomorrow will you let me be just as bad as I like all the next day?",
  "57757": "For the father's?",
  "57758": "You're not turning your head to look after more moths, are you?",
  "57759": "And what more do you see?",
  "57760": "Do you answer me with a few regiments?",
  "57761": "Must the young men not look at the young women?",
  "57762": "Was it as she was about to take the veil that they had cast thither that love dowry as a pledge to the world of the living?",
  "57763": "Tell him what?",
  "57764": "Why had he done this?",
  "57765": "Had he seen his father?",
  "57766": "Whom do you bring?",
  "57767": "What does it matter about the trumpery cheque?",
  "57768": "But how could I live up to it?",
  "57769": "But when I assure you that you may rely on my tenderness?",
  "57770": "And what would be the use if she were?",
  "57771": "Have there, indeed, now?",
  "57772": "For whom are you looking, my fine fellow?",
  "57773": "Why did men come to that once forbidding land ?",
  "57774": "What are you thinking of this evening?",
  "57775": "And do you now intend, on this account, to deny the debt?",
  "57776": "Are fathers unnatural, and children prodigal?",
  "57777": "Where shall I find a refuge?",
  "57778": "Who would live amidst perpetual wrangling, and scolding, and mutual reproaches?",
  "57779": "Why do you ask?",
  "57780": "Say?",
  "57781": "For how can the tears of my neighbour benefit me?",
  "57782": "Oh, where are you going, my lord?",
  "57783": "The officer of the guard, then, with his chessboard?",
  "57784": "Is it not then reasonable to infer that, if he had really been guilty of forming a base conspiracy against the fame and fortunes of a rival, he would have expressed some remorse for so serious a crime?",
  "57785": "Do you think the experiment will work?",
  "57786": "What is wrong?",
  "57787": "And can you send me to the station this afternoon?",
  "57788": "Nor him?",
  "57789": "And have these pets got anything on THEIR minds, eh?",
  "57790": "Had you any emeralds?",
  "57791": "And are you going?",
  "57792": "At what o'clock was it raised?",
  "57793": "All of them?",
  "57794": "Do you remember this?",
  "57795": "In the house?",
  "57796": "I say, what's the matter?",
  "57797": "Shall I go and dance before these demons and let them see what a human being can do?",
  "57798": "Why have men of superior endowments submitted to such degradation?",
  "57799": "You, a detective?",
  "57800": "Yes, but they are a long way off, those isles, are they not?",
  "57801": "Then after all my dreams, after all my patience, you do not love me at last?",
  "57802": "Now which are you going to marry?",
  "57803": "And how is your friend?",
  "57804": "Who forces you to do so?",
  "57805": "And his last promotion was due to you?",
  "57806": "Yes, you have seen him?",
  "57807": "Who could expect otherwise than that, with the prospect before him of viewing the giant among planets, ten times nearer than any mortal eye had ever done, he should have begrudged every moment that distracted his attention?",
  "57808": "I have?",
  "57809": "Which concerns me?",
  "57810": "But where will he find the knowledge which can enable him to enounce synthetical judgements in regard to things which transcend the region of experience?",
  "57811": "Neither of them there?",
  "57812": "I hope I find you pretty well?",
  "57813": "Died?",
  "57814": "Shall I take up your bucket, or will you go with me?",
  "57815": "Will you keep my child for me?",
  "57816": "What do I care for this country?",
  "57817": "Is there nothing that can be done?",
  "57818": "How did he know where chance might one day cast his companions and himself in the event of their leaving their domain?",
  "57819": "Do you think so?",
  "57820": "My man in the wrong?",
  "57821": "Are you in want of anything?",
  "57822": "Why do you talk nonsense?",
  "57823": "And how are all the bad governments in the world to be made good?",
  "57824": "What then is this rule of right?",
  "57825": "Where will you go?",
  "57826": "What for?",
  "57827": "Will fate play tricks upon me?",
  "57828": "Well, did he tell you that he draws three per cent of the gross receipts?",
  "57829": "And who are you?",
  "57830": "Remain at home and become an old maid and be laughed at?",
  "57831": "What devil brought them here?",
  "57832": "What people are these?",
  "57833": "You mean that you can no longer rely upon me?",
  "57834": "Have they?",
  "57835": "Or perhaps he may tell a lie because he is afraid of enemies?",
  "57836": "What crotchet is this?",
  "57837": "Is it therefore nothing?",
  "57838": "You told him it was for me?",
  "57839": "Are the young ladies and all the family quite well?",
  "57840": "That's all, is it?",
  "57841": "You will do everything sure?",
  "57842": "There was a child, was there not?",
  "57843": "And when is your next ball?",
  "57844": "Well, how are you getting on?",
  "57845": "Are you the first that this hand has stricken?",
  "57846": "Do you see this silver bugle?",
  "57847": "Was this altogether just?",
  "57848": "Going back?",
  "57849": "Should he find it in time?",
  "57850": "Can there be deliverance when there is eternal justice?",
  "57851": "Is it spoken to after death as if alive?",
  "57852": "Is that all the message?",
  "57853": "Did she make it clear why, on reaching her house, she ran into the back kitchen?",
  "57854": "If comedy be an imitation, under whatever conventions, of real life, how is it possible that it can have no reference to the great rule which directs life, and to feelings which are called forth by every incident of life?",
  "57855": "What must I do?",
  "57856": "Are they friends?",
  "57857": "There is no way of getting out?",
  "57858": "Shall you ever find such another?",
  "57859": "O, you'll slip your head out of the collar?",
  "57860": "The question I'm asking you is what shall we say to him?",
  "57861": "This he?",
  "57862": "How can you?",
  "57863": "Or, what more effective means to one's moral improvement?",
  "57864": "Why, what business can he have?",
  "57865": "Any more of whom?",
  "57866": "What more can I say for my client?",
  "57867": "And who are you?",
  "57868": "What is your demand?",
  "57869": "What do you propose to do with it?",
  "57870": "Doth he love us?",
  "57871": "What other satisfaction can it give me?",
  "57872": "Where will they be, and what will they say?",
  "57873": "Were there not currents higher up that would waft him to less arid regions?",
  "57874": "Are we not, uncle?",
  "57875": "A spare wheel?",
  "57876": "Now, why did he wish for this agent?",
  "57877": "Or some innocent out of the hospital, that would stand with her hands thus, and a plaise mouth, and look upon you?",
  "57878": "Or what are the inconveniences of a few months to the tributary bondage of ages?",
  "57879": "And are you really firm in your resolve?",
  "57880": "But what do they want?",
  "57881": "Do you remember the bishop's preaching against your father's chanting?",
  "57882": "Does she like it?",
  "57883": "Now what's the consequence?",
  "57884": "What was the cause of that malady?",
  "57885": "Have you ever seen a photograph of her first husband?",
  "57886": "By that means you got promotion?",
  "57887": "You dethroned the king?",
  "57888": "Is there no clue there?",
  "57889": "And where did he say that he lived?",
  "57890": "But why should I learn these things, that we all know?",
  "57891": "Who is it directed to?",
  "57892": "I wonder whether if I was to shut myself up in a cage for six months, it would do any good?",
  "57893": "For 'some' reason?",
  "57894": "Are these your good men, my dears?",
  "57895": "Where could it be hidden?",
  "57896": "I have heard curious tales about her before now, but if she came to invite us to her house, why did she behave so to my mother?",
  "57897": "Waiting for who?",
  "57898": "And why did you insist upon letting fall the bug, instead of a bullet, from the skull?",
  "57899": "How was he to back out of a matter in which his name was already so publicly concerned?",
  "57900": "How then are we to account for male mammals possessing mammae?",
  "57901": "But what is there interesting about it?",
  "57902": "Have you got clear of all your sins, cousin?",
  "57903": "What happened there, madam?",
  "57904": "Do I say right, mother?",
  "57905": "How did you get things settled?",
  "57906": "And did he mention that this is the ninth show he's done, and that seven of the others were just as big hits as this one?",
  "57907": "Have you ever known him ill?",
  "57908": "Shall I receive it from my father?",
  "57909": "Now I believe our accounts are settled, are they not, monsieur l'hote?",
  "57910": "Not handsome?",
  "57911": "Why are you worrying me?",
  "57912": "What, then, is the reason?",
  "57913": "I suppose you have a nightgown?",
  "57914": "How many should say there were on your side, doctor?",
  "57915": "I am sure you mean well, but are you quite certain that you know how to execute such a trust as this?",
  "57916": "Why did you not at once rid yourself of that abominable nightmare?",
  "57917": "Then the cardinal will be pleased with me?",
  "57918": "Well, do you think that it was she who stole the money?",
  "57919": "What holds my heart in anguish of suspense?",
  "57920": "But how about his food?",
  "57921": "I hope the accident has been of no consequence?",
  "57922": "And will not the bravest and wisest soul be least confused or deranged by any external influence?",
  "57923": "But wherefore are you here?",
  "57924": "What should she say?",
  "57925": "Who brings this?",
  "57926": "Is it philosophy?",
  "57927": "How may I counsel their death?",
  "57928": "By virtue of what right?",
  "57929": "How do you know that he values it highly?",
  "57930": "But your mother?",
  "57931": "How long are the holidays?",
  "57932": "But how can I sell out here?",
  "57933": "Why did he not call us?",
  "57934": "Euphrasie?",
  "57935": "Whither lead their steps?",
  "57936": "Might it reawake the dying nerve if the family were living close against her eyes?",
  "57937": "Well, who crossed me?",
  "57938": "How shall I ever get my heart?",
  "57939": "Well, shall we get home by evening?",
  "57940": "Whither are you taking me?",
  "57941": "Well, let me see, what can you want that begins with N?",
  "57942": "Who would believe it?",
  "57943": "And the brother and sister are pursuing their old course, are they?",
  "57944": "Why?",
  "57945": "For I ask any one, if upon mention of a right line he thinks not immediately on such a particular appearance, and if it is not by accident only that he considers this property?",
  "57946": "If you come to that, you know, how is anybody's tongue to be stopped?",
  "57947": "Do you happen to carry a box?",
  "57948": "How am I to say like that straight off?",
  "57949": "And her son?",
  "57950": "Whither are they going?",
  "57951": "He has soft, smooth paws, has he?",
  "57952": "What about my suit?",
  "57953": "Free them, and make them politically and socially our equals?",
  "57954": "Why did I not stop her?",
  "57955": "Who could it be?",
  "57956": "So what could I do, sir?",
  "57957": "What would you do in my position?",
  "57958": "Did you not see his face?",
  "57959": "Did I not come myself with the best and bravest I could bring?",
  "57960": "All is not then over?",
  "57961": "Did they alight on the road in the course of the night?",
  "57962": "Can it be religion?",
  "57963": "And you will have her named?",
  "57964": "And who cares whether you are sure or not, ma'am?",
  "57965": "Water?",
  "57966": "Will you be as careful as all that?",
  "57967": "How was it possible that these things could be taught too early?",
  "57968": "What was morality worth if it was not that which on the whole brought a man peace at the last, and could anyone have reasonable certainty that marriage would do this?",
  "57969": "Is anything the matter with her?",
  "57970": "What care I for renown and honor, if he is not there to see my greatness, and if his beaming eyes do not reflect back to me the light of my crown?",
  "57971": "Well, what's the row?",
  "57972": "Are you then yet angry with me that I did not comply with your first request?",
  "57973": "What has happened to him?",
  "57974": "Where in the world did you come from?",
  "57975": "Are they inside with the governor?",
  "57976": "Or what do you mean?",
  "57977": "He broke out, a great hopeless HOW ON EARTH CAN I KEEP YOU?",
  "57978": "And now, what is forbidden?",
  "57979": "And why was it so with her?",
  "57980": "A brazier of charcoal?",
  "57981": "What, therefore, is our conclusion?",
  "57982": "Who, senor?",
  "57983": "What shall we say, then, when he really sinks?",
  "57984": "Can I go?",
  "57985": "Is it not perfectly clear that the property of this industrious generation will stand on a basis of right, if the value or wealth produced by the activity of all be distributed among the producers, according to each one's assistance in the creation of the general wealth?",
  "57986": "Have those public endowments contributed in general, to promote the end of their institution ?",
  "57987": "And did it go off all right?",
  "57988": "Is it possible to forget?",
  "57989": "Are you quite mad?",
  "57990": "Why did she weep?",
  "57991": "Have you heard him say anything out of the way?",
  "57992": "You're an engaged man?",
  "57993": "Meantime what has become of the king?",
  "57994": "Do you always draw your breath like that?",
  "57995": "Is it JOHN?",
  "57996": "How is our angel?",
  "57997": "But you can tell me?",
  "57998": "Where are you dragging me to?",
  "57999": "But were we not saying that such a contradiction is the same faculty cannot have contrary opinions at the same time about the same thing?",
  "58000": "What is there to see?",
  "58001": "Are you going out?",
  "58002": "If supply and demand alone determine value, how can we tell what is an excess and what is a SUFFICIENCY?",
  "58003": "Know you the secret of it then?",
  "58004": "What was to become of him?",
  "58005": "Did I tell this, who would believe me?",
  "58006": "Cathy, are you busy this afternoon?",
  "58007": "What is going on in the world?",
  "58008": "Maybe you know he has?",
  "58009": "Cross to her, I suppose?",
  "58010": "How do you feel about it?",
  "58011": "For yourself?",
  "58012": "Is that the truth?",
  "58013": "Far away?",
  "58014": "As they are wanted for immediate service, will you throw your eye over them?",
  "58015": "Where did you get them?",
  "58016": "Is not a divorce possible?",
  "58017": "Were such a man once more to fall, what plea could be urged in extenuation of his crime?",
  "58018": "Who can this be?",
  "58019": "They behave a little odd, eh?",
  "58020": "Can you honestly say 'Remain' after contemplating this contingency?",
  "58021": "And was he not our superior?",
  "58022": "Where does he live?",
  "58023": "What motive would tempt any set of men to go into an extensive survey of a railroad which they did not intend to make?",
  "58024": "Is that letter in your hand anything for me to see, my dear?",
  "58025": "But my goodness, he never plays them alike, two days, and how is a body to know what's coming?",
  "58026": "When did that end and when did this new, terrible state of things begin?",
  "58027": "What, he that points to it with his finger?",
  "58028": "What do they teach?",
  "58029": "How could I, when, blended with it all, was her dear self, the better angel of my life?",
  "58030": "Has anyone denied it, that you would strive to drive a poor man like that beyond his wits?",
  "58031": "If, then, production continues in the national workshops, how will the crisis be terminated?",
  "58032": "And so I am not to speak a word of this to any one whatever, save to you?",
  "58033": "Do you know why it seems so?",
  "58034": "What do you want more?",
  "58035": "Did I ask you to?",
  "58036": "And what part did he play in this sad drama?",
  "58037": "How did they accomplish that now, think you?",
  "58038": "What think you of the place?",
  "58039": "In whom can you trust to protect the country and watch over the palace?",
  "58040": "Him in the next box?",
  "58041": "Every time I have tried?",
  "58042": "Is it no later than that?",
  "58043": "What would you both live on?",
  "58044": "Was it really better?",
  "58045": "Why do you not write them yourself?",
  "58046": "Have you ever had that mystical feeling that things have happened before?",
  "58047": "Where our property?",
  "58048": "What good genius?",
  "58049": "Oh, dear grandmamma, are you worse?",
  "58050": "What is the connection of that man with my childhood and life?",
  "58051": "And now, corporal, what is your business with me?",
  "58052": "At your age is it likely?",
  "58053": "But why are you so anxious?",
  "58054": "Shall I tell you what I think?",
  "58055": "What shall I say of her beauty?",
  "58056": "For the protection of barges and such?",
  "58057": "Which way be they going now?",
  "58058": "Wherever from, he asked his heart, where from did you get this happiness?",
  "58059": "Then you can hand them over to us right away?",
  "58060": "Wish what?",
  "58061": "What is the matter, my lord?",
  "58062": "But how can that be?",
  "58063": "Do you expect him back to dinner?",
  "58064": "No?",
  "58065": "Take the notes out?",
  "58066": "Who are your heroes?",
  "58067": "Well, what were we saying?",
  "58068": "Is it possible I have found a place that may serve as a secret grave for the weary load of this body that I support so unwillingly?",
  "58069": "Will you, will you, will you leave my father to die in peace in his quiet home?",
  "58070": "Or is gull'd?",
  "58071": "Which of you will take charge of the transaction?",
  "58072": "Is it good and sufficient, or is it insufficient and bad?",
  "58073": "And shall we proceed a step further, and affirm that there is such a thing as equality, not of one piece of wood or stone with another, but that, over and above this, there is absolute equality?",
  "58074": "What of the lad?",
  "58075": "Did we not swear friendship?",
  "58076": "But what?",
  "58077": "What sort of person is he?",
  "58078": "Then what do you fight on my wharf for, you villain?",
  "58079": "On brothers?",
  "58080": "And who ate the cat?",
  "58081": "Could she think it was to deny her a pleasure that she might harmlessly enjoy?",
  "58082": "And now, dean, what must I do about the living?",
  "58083": "But will he not desire to get them on the spot?",
  "58084": "What is your discussion about today?",
  "58085": "Why do you like my eyes?",
  "58086": "Who knows her secret?",
  "58087": "But what does he mean by saying he is a student of a mission college?",
  "58088": "Why, I want to ask, aunt, as this seems, from what I understand, to be a limited profession, whether my entrance into it would not be very expensive?",
  "58089": "Do you know how he is tonight?",
  "58090": "To what prisoner?",
  "58091": "It will take a good ten minutes to go from hence to the blue room, and to return?",
  "58092": "Hurray?",
  "58093": "Is the girl who awakens him the fresh verdure or the genial sunshine of spring?",
  "58094": "Should I lay it up in a case and keep it?",
  "58095": "Well, will you do it?",
  "58096": "But who could recount all the happy and hapless loves that have made poets?",
  "58097": "What is badness?",
  "58098": "Would you have me knock the head of you with the butt of the broom?",
  "58099": "Why, what do you want there?",
  "58100": "And, besides, he said them little birds had said it was going to rain, and did I want the things to get wet?",
  "58101": "You have not been here before last night?",
  "58102": "A machine for saving work, is it?",
  "58103": "Will you have vanille ice or pineapple?",
  "58104": "Who can wonder that the world should be a blank to her?",
  "58105": "Why not try it?",
  "58106": "A knight live by his verses?",
  "58107": "What can this mean?",

  "59657": "And in the first place, he will honour studies which impress these qualities on his soul and disregard others?",
  "59658": "Would I come and look at it?",
  "59659": "Did you remark the postmarks of those letters?",
  "59660": "Do you see what I meant about the clothes falling off?",
  "59661": "Where is your escort?",
  "59662": "Is it necessary, pray, to illustrate a remark in so practical a style?",
  "59663": "Would he go and describe his rough reception, or recount his exploit?",
  "59664": "What, in the name of everything hideous, did this mean?",
  "59665": "Are you going somewhere?",
  "59666": "Do you know her?",
  "59667": "What can have happened?",
  "59668": "I presume you know, gentlemen, to whom my friend is indebted for this piece of patronage?",
  "59669": "Why are you distressed?",
  "59670": "Are you going to have lunch too?",
  "59671": "And what is the means?",
  "59672": "And if I did know them now, what would it avail me?",
  "59673": "What would you have?",
  "59674": "Revels?",
  "59675": "Now will you believe I'm in earnest?",
  "59676": "Is the sun up?",
  "59677": "Oh, what's that?",
  "59678": "Is it the immediate object of this confidence, that you may at once ascertain that, with my knowledge?",
  "59679": "How large was it?",
  "59680": "Then had I not best send him about his business?",
  "59681": "What does it matter?",
  "59682": "Shall we invite him into our hearts?",
  "59683": "What have you done with her, then, if you have her no longer?",
  "59684": "Then you'll not be wanting me any more tonight, ma'am?",
  "59685": "Jane, do you hear that nightingale singing in the wood?",
  "59686": "Where could they be going?",
  "59687": "Not in regular government pay and employment, to lay traps?",
  "59688": "But who could affirm, who would dare to say, that the amiable fellow did not really see that which his two companions would not see?",
  "59689": "What was it that she wanted of him?",
  "59690": "Where are the nearest?",
  "59691": "How has he drawn you to himself?",
  "59692": "Not even of sending me a scrap of stuff for a new dress?",
  "59693": "If he cuts off one of his own toes, or one of his assistants', would you be very much astonished?",
  "59694": "Was the weather hot or cold?",
  "59695": "Where was my baggage?",
  "59696": "Authority?",
  "59697": "Tell him or not tell him?",
  "59698": "O you will let me hold your brave hand, stranger?",
  "59699": "You think so, my lord?",
  "59700": "In your left ear?",
  "59701": "Who shall live up to the great trust?",
  "59702": "Are we there already?",
  "59703": "And my council dares to temper and negotiate?",
  "59704": "How are you?",
  "59705": "But what?",
  "59706": "It was you, was it not?",
  "59707": "Am I not by?",
  "59708": "Have you given up loving her altogether?",
  "59709": "What good does it do?",
  "59710": "You have never heard her nephew play?",
  "59711": "What sin, mademoiselle?",
  "59712": "Or that it is impossible to draw more than one right line betwixt any two points?",
  "59713": "Do you think I could ever skip like that?",
  "59714": "Can you send me to the station?",
  "59715": "When did you leave service?",
  "59716": "Well, what do you think of that?",
  "59717": "What DO you know of him?",
  "59718": "What good will he be to the tribe?",
  "59719": "What, did you come digging here entirely because of me?",
  "59720": "Do you feel that you have lost her?",
  "59721": "What, senor?",
  "59722": "Or the raspberry?",
  "59723": "What is there?",
  "59724": "What have you been after?",
  "59725": "But who are all these?",
  "59726": "Oh, I?",
  "59727": "You here again?",
  "59728": "You have no trouble, I hope, to keep you waking?",
  "59729": "What is, or was, their address?",
  "59730": "But of what disease, then, did she die?",
  "59731": "Trodden upon by whom?",
  "59732": "Mighty men?",
  "59733": "No, but what do you mean?",
  "59734": "Yes, I am out of temper, and do you know why?",
  "59735": "Did you ever hear anything like your brother's eloquence?",
  "59736": "And what is the use of a fellow having a little money if it does not make him independent?",
  "59737": "Why have you no pride?",
  "59738": "Who are you, that you are to play with two young people's affections and break their hearts at your will?",
  "59739": "Yes?",
  "59740": "You mean, will it be prudent?",
  "59741": "What is justice?",
  "59742": "How so?",
  "59743": "What's in it?",
  "59744": "Did he himself find no cause for laughter on the earth?",
  "59745": "And who completed it as it now is?"
