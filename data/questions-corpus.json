  "927": "What does that inexplicable, that uncanny turn of countenance mean?",
  "928": "Is it possible I can go over there on the ice, go up to her?",
  "929": "You've seen a boy a slidin on a most beautiful smooth bit of ice, ha'nt you, larfin, and hoopin, and hallooin like one possessed, when presently sowse he goes in over head and ears?",
  "930": "You remember that?",

  "986": "What riots?",
  "987": "Of what use is it, seeing that the religious feel no need of it, but on the contrary take delight in the religion as it stands, which fills the void in their soul?",
  "988": "What am I to do if they come and take the house, and sell the furniture, and turn me out into the street?",
  "989": "O, what has made my lovely daughter sad?",
  "990": "But where can the boy have gone?",
  "991": "Do you want help?",

  "1017": "Ah, you are a cardinalist, then, monsieur, are you?",
  "1018": "She is not particularly handsome, if I remember right?",
  "1019": "So you are free now, and rich?",
  "1020": "Do they not submit to a single governor, and to the consular bundle of rods?",
  "1021": "How long has she been going on with this?",
  "1022": "Why does that gentleman never come except at nightfall?",
  "1023": "Do they not have the hardest of it?",

  "1042": "Would not he who is fitted to be a guardian, besides the spirited nature, need to have the qualities of a philosopher?",
  "1043": "But, to begin with, will you tell me something?",
  "1044": "Strip it of all its ornament, run it down to the root and nucleus of the whole, and what is it?",
  "1045": "Well, my good fellow, what is it?",
  "1046": "Why do you not NOW marry that generous man who loves you, and has done you the honour of offering you his hand?",
  "1047": "What shall our city be called?",
  "1048": "Why is it so solid?",
  "1049": "Are those of your own name dear to you?",

  "1051": "That you might learn your lessons better?",
  "1052": "Who can be in a poorer or more pitiful condition than those who are buried in fire?",
  "1053": "But still it was probable that this man would not recognise her, and, if he did so, what would it matter?",
  "1054": "And for whom is the second appointment destined?",
  "1055": "Whither will you send her?",
  "1056": "Well, what if there is?",

  "1311": "Can it be there's no chance of it?",
  "1312": "The poor fellow had got the attorney to promise secrecy, but what of that?",
  "1313": "I wonder where are they, those good fellows?",
  "1314": "Why do we daily commit disagreeable and dangerous actions?",
  "1315": "What have these pests of the earth been doing to you?",
  "1316": "Where had they fled when the next morning I awoke?",
  "1317": "Did I wake or sleep?",
  "1318": "Are we going to take him as a servant?",
  "1319": "Why so fierce?",
  "1320": "For what is it we call a man of birth, but one who is descended from a long succession of rich and powerful ancestors, and who acquires our esteem by his relation to persons whom we esteem?",
  "1321": "Would you mind telling me, so that I can see whether you are not mistaken?",
  "1322": "How are your brains?",
  "1323": "Could any government do more to train the people in the way in which he would have them go?",
  "1324": "After all, what good was this?",
  "1325": "You mean perhaps to be a painter?",
  "1326": "For whom was the first appointment?",
  "1327": "Well, what should I have done?",
  "1328": "Where's my considering cap?",
  "1329": "How did you come by this letter?",
  "1330": "One or other?",
  "1331": "Would he arouse him with a throb of agony?",
  "1332": "But, really, for mercy's sake, prince, what have I done?",
  "1333": "Has anything happened?",
  "1334": "Come up on the tramp?",
  "1335": "What was he doing on the tower?",
  "1336": "What did they contain of pleasure, of happiness, or of grief?",
  "1337": "What do you mean, cousin?",
  "1338": "But then, when you wish to embark, you are obliged to come to the surface of the water?",
  "1339": "What has he in his arms?",
  "1340": "For what now was the first thing you were taught?",
  "1341": "Shall we yield ourselves to him?",
  "1342": "Will you enter, and see my wife?",
  "1343": "Could it then be possible?",
  "1344": "What are these imperious sympathies?",
  "1345": "Could this, too, be a wig?",
  "1346": "Do you consider it an accidental case, prince?",
  "1347": "Will you add these twenty francs to the seven you have?",
  "1348": "And you failed?",
  "1349": "Then you know nothing of the city?",
  "1350": "Was that wise?",
  "1351": "They had a youth with them?",
  "1352": "Were they intelligent mechanisms?",
  "1353": "Are you in a place?",
  "1354": "Warn her?",
  "1355": "Shall we have it up here, or go down to the restaurant?",
  "1356": "And you say that one of your friends lives in that house?",
  "1357": "What does he send me?",
  "1358": "He was only talking to himself, saying 'Over, is it?",
  "1359": "And would not the deficiencies of one year be made up for by the surplus of another?",
  "1360": "I understood, of course, that he saw something, but what?",
  "1361": "Where did you find so many diamonds?",
  "1362": "But tell me, senor, what do you call this excellent and rare adventure that has left us as we are left now?",
  "1363": "Why should you get into such a tantrum about nothing?",
  "1364": "Are you not nearly spent with the heat?",
  "1365": "Do you think you are where you used to be?",
  "1366": "Then the eleventh day must have been a holiday?",
  "1367": "But what can you expect of a creature from the deanery?",
  "1368": "The children?",
  "1369": "You are, doubtless, acquainted with a variety of languages, so as to have been able to read all these?",
  "1370": "What makes you think that?",
  "1371": "Why then are we to believe the same thing of another girl whom we never saw, told by nobody knows who, nor when, nor where?",
  "1372": "Were they going to let him alone this time?",
  "1373": "Had you commissioned me?",
  "1374": "And you remember that we came up with the two in a ditch, and that there was a scuffle between them, and that one of them had been severely handled and much mauled about the face by the other?",
  "1375": "What has the change been?",
  "1376": "And where is the next point?",
  "1377": "It is not such a very dreadful circumstance that we are odd people, is it?",
  "1378": "What says my nephew?",
  "1379": "Who's firing?",
  "1380": "Mamma, are you cross?",
  "1381": "Perhaps you think the poor might have their part?",
  "1382": "Then I am to blow my brains out?",
  "1383": "What is it then, for goodness' sake?",
  "1384": "Poison him?",
  "1385": "And do you hear?",
  "1386": "What shall we do?",
  "1387": "Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?",
  "1388": "What's this paper?",
  "1389": "Then it was to go to her that you left us?",
  "1390": "Are we not endowed with inner force to fight successfully against obstacles and difficulties, and to wrest trophies of glory from hardships?",
  "1391": "Then I am condemned, sire?",
  "1392": "Could he be trying to measure the thickness of the crust of the earth that lay between us and the world above?",
  "1393": "What do you mean to do about this you have seen?",
  "1394": "But your old friends of the musketeers?",
  "1395": "How to get rid of him?",
  "1396": "Each time there had been no sentence of importance which she could relate, and as for the glances and sensations, what woman would reveal them?",
  "1397": "Go and call upon this girl?",
  "1398": "Till he yield to me?",
  "1399": "You're back from leave, I suppose?",
  "1400": "Where are the papers of this prisoner?",
  "1401": "I say, friends, have you heard?",
  "1402": "Well, I said, and how does the change from oligarchy into democracy arise?",
  "1403": "Will you let them come?",
  "1404": "I mean that are not there now?",
  "1405": "Why have they not got rid of him?",
  "1406": "And will you tell me what a gentleman is?",
  "1407": "Were you in love with him?",
  "1408": "Does a woman ever know how much such speeches cost?",
  "1409": "How is this seeming miracle accomplished?",
  "1410": "Do you not humble me if you are too proud to accept what is due to you from my brother?",
  "1411": "Did you have a nice walk?",
  "1412": "Would it not be more like a man to go before his face, and take the satisfaction of a warrior?",
  "1413": "How much does the hire amount to since yesterday?",
  "1414": "Have you heard the password?",
  "1415": "But where are the huts?",
  "1416": "Why should all the parts and organs of many independent beings, each supposed to have been separately created for its proper place in nature, be so invariably linked together by graduated steps?",
  "1417": "What would be the use?",
  "1418": "But how did she become so?",
  "1419": "As before?",
  "1420": "But can the crude fruit of casual observation, never brought to the test of judgment, formed by comparing speculation and experience, deserve such a distinction?",
  "1421": "But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge?",
  "1422": "How can it be foreign?",
  "1423": "Which of your uncles do you like best?",
  "1424": "And what is it to be?",
  "1425": "That we may find it necessary to punish the injury you have done to us?",
  "1426": "Ex tempore?",
  "1427": "Their father is dead?",
  "1428": "Or what is gone with my lords your brethren?",
  "1429": "Well, then, how about the land?",
  "1430": "What business have you at all with these interviews?",
  "1431": "How long was she there?",
  "1432": "But may I regard certain arrangements, which seemed to have been made in conformity with some fixed aim, as the arrangements of design, and look upon them as proceeding from the divine will, with the intervention, however, of certain other particular arrangements disposed to that end?",
  "1433": "A whole bottle?",
  "1434": "Moved?",
  "1435": "Is he not a man of honour and feeling?",
  "1436": "For if we fail in this our fight he must surely win, and then where end we?",
  "1437": "The great question certainly was, what?",
  "1438": "He supposed he was right?",
  "1439": "Is nothing due to the man whom we have all such reason to love, and no reason in the world to think ill of?",
  "1440": "But when you are not sure whether it is a fact or not, what are you to do?",
  "1441": "Would you like to see 'em?",
  "1442": "Which of the two?",
  "1443": "Has either of them confided anything to you by word of mouth?",
  "1444": "Has he ploughed, sowed, reaped, mowed, winnowed, weeded?",
  "1445": "Opposite the scaffold?",
  "1446": "Has anyone gone for the opossum?",
  "1447": "Apiece?",
  "1448": "Monseigneur assures me that the devil has nothing to do with this?",
  "1449": "Well, is it not noble to defend the poets, and introduce to the public all the new scientific and political ideas?",
  "1450": "Is this just?",
  "1451": "But how can you get there?",
  "1452": "Would you help me?",
  "1453": "What of the race, my pulse?",
  "1454": "What right had they to weep over or to talk about her?",
  "1455": "What's he like, this lad?",
  "1456": "What do you think, can a man be suffocated with a wet cloth?",
  "1457": "Is the loin pork enough?",
  "1458": "Put it straight, will you?",
  "1459": "Are you not, comrade?",
  "1460": "How is that, my child?",
  "1461": "And what after that?",
  "1462": "Do you repent of your sins, and do you acknowledge death as a righteous expiation and punishment?",
  "1463": "Shall I serve my child by a lie?",
  "1464": "Hey, who's there?",
  "1465": "How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments?",
  "1466": "Is not death opposed to life?",
  "1467": "And how much will that pair of stockings be worth when she has finished them?",
  "1468": "Grimaud, why did you not tell me this?",
  "1469": "My superintendent would not find me any money?",
  "1470": "How came it yours?",
  "1471": "Besides, who is to choose the velvet and cut for this young dandy?",
  "1472": "Who wants a protector?",
  "1473": "ARE they memorials?",
  "1474": "Exactly of what else could a platform consist?",
  "1475": "Why are you making knots in that ribbon, and writing invisible characters on the floor with the point of that busy little foot?",
  "1476": "Of my own life?",
  "1477": "What do these sounds portend?",
  "1478": "And who knows it?",
  "1479": "Can you do it?",
  "1480": "Or are you going to keep it right alongside of us outrageous fellows?",
  "1481": "You consider that to be important?",
  "1482": "Should I?",
  "1483": "Has he, ma'am?",
  "1484": "What precaution?",
  "1485": "On his track?",
  "1486": "Was not he disguised?",
  "1487": "And the quilting of the stairs no where worn out, and bare?",
  "1488": "What have you there?",
  "1489": "You go back and watch that long, will you?",
  "1490": "Will they abandon them in misfortune?",
  "1491": "What, then, will you say?",
  "1492": "Why, is it hid all around?",
  "1493": "You think love is the ticket, do you?",
  "1494": "Old or young?",
  "1495": "Has no copy been taken?",
  "1496": "Do you love him, love him with all your heart and soul, with all the love your bosom can feel?",
  "1497": "And how do you feel about it?",
  "1498": "What are fireworks like?",
  "1499": "Whom am I and what am I?",
  "1500": "Oh, why had she sent her letter?",
  "1501": "Do you conceive me, gentlemen?",
  "1502": "To what, ma'am?",
  "1503": "But how much truth was behind it?",
  "1504": "What does it contain?",
  "1505": "Why should it break three inches from the top, as this one has done?",
  "1506": "Was it last evening that you came on board this vessel?",
  "1507": "And why not a bowl of rack punch as well as any other cause?",
  "1508": "Would it be some young man or other whom she takes an interest in?",
  "1509": "Is it absolutely necessary to go on with the letter, darling?",
  "1510": "Is that a genuine letter you are reading?",
  "1511": "What could be better?",
  "1512": "What has she been telling you?",
  "1513": "Why is that little, and the little freedom they enjoy, to be infringed?",
  "1514": "Had I been remanded to my dungeon, to await the next sacrifice, which would not take place for many months?",
  "1515": "Will she recover?",
  "1516": "Is that what you mean?",
  "1517": "But now that virtue has become to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into bitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy?",
  "1518": "What do you mean by going with other men, anyway?",
  "1519": "Where's the lecture room, d'you know?",
  "1520": "What would be the end?",
  "1521": "Feelin' sick?",
  "1522": "Determine on what?",
  "1523": "And yet what?",
  "1524": "Why risk the world's great empire for a punk?",
  "1525": "You mean, spend too much money?",
  "1526": "Nose and all?",
  "1527": "And will you answer it?",
  "1528": "How, then, will competition be harmoniously determined in society?",
  "1529": "Have I got to drink that stuff?",
  "1530": "Ruined her?",
  "1531": "So that I need not make use of this petition?",
  "1532": "But what do you conclude from that, father?",
  "1533": "What took place?",
  "1534": "Will you give your honour not to fire while we talk?",
  "1535": "What's the use of that?",
  "1536": "What's fame?",
  "1537": "Where would be the use of it?",
  "1538": "My purpose, for why should I deny it?",
  "1539": "Do you contradict me?",
  "1540": "What makes you so smitten with that little vermin?",
  "1541": "But how did you get in here?",
  "1542": "Where was the man flying to after such dreadful retaliation?",
  "1543": "Why not still proceed over the untamed yet obedient element?",
  "1544": "For, suppose the manufacturer, who seems to make this profit on his property, wishes also to make it on his merchandise, can he then pay himself one franc for that which cost him ninety centimes, and make money by the operation?",
  "1545": "Why then has he never taken part in public affairs?",
  "1546": "From that woman?",
  "1547": "Does not every merchant have his secret mark?",
  "1548": "And that others should approve of what we approve, is no miracle or impossibility?",
  "1549": "He will be a baronet, will he not?",
  "1550": "To what purpose?",
  "1551": "Can you pray?",
  "1552": "And can his majesty count upon many such subjects as yourself for his flight?",
  "1553": "What became of him?",
  "1554": "How many arms have you there ready for distribution?",
  "1555": "Will you come and see me?",
  "1556": "What makes you suppose I know?",
  "1557": "But what am I to do with the brute?",
  "1558": "What nonsense is this?",
  "1559": "Where was she now?",
  "1560": "How do you explain the influence the count evidently possessed over those ruffians?",
  "1561": "What is the idea of you buying a fox skin, you poor beggar?",
  "1562": "Lost confidence?",
  "1563": "How could he have chosen a better friend in whom to trust?",
  "1564": "In the same way?",
  "1565": "What was your remark, my dear friend?",
  "1566": "Why do you answer me so roughly?",
  "1567": "What's going to become of us now?",
  "1568": "And what will the be the good of your going on after that?",
  "1569": "Is it right?",
  "1570": "Be terrorized by every prating paper?",
  "1571": "Are many of the young ladies with you?",
  "1572": "Oh, she thinks me too meek?",
  "1573": "Sparking plugs, eh?",
  "1574": "Was he alone, that long night, whose brave, loving spirit was bearing up, in that old shed, against buffeting and brutal stripes?",
  "1575": "I am out of all that, am I not?",
  "1576": "Have there not been religions indisputably on a moral level lower than that of the community which they represent?",
  "1577": "What are you going to do next?",
  "1578": "Who was her father?",
  "1579": "In fact, has ANYTHING ever been done by government for the interest of the private settler?",
  "1580": "And what is human omnipotence?",
  "1581": "So you have brought him thither from the barricade?",
  "1582": "But what would you say of equal portions of wood and stone, or other material equals?",
  "1583": "Have I anything to pay?",
  "1584": "Do they think to have to do with a ninnywhoop, to feed you thus with cakes?",
  "1585": "Is it at the city of the stones or in the garden of the palms?",
  "1586": "What the devil are you waiting for?",
  "1587": "I suppose that none of these securities have been found among the property of the dead man?",
  "1588": "Chance?",
  "1589": "Oh, you want a knife?",
  "1590": "But who will distribute these things?",
  "1591": "Who wrote the letter?",
  "1592": "I suppose that you would know him when you saw him?",
  "1593": "Then, under the influence either of poverty or of wealth, workmen and their work are equally liable to degenerate?",
  "1594": "Are there any newspapers now?",
  "1595": "Who is that other person?",
  "1596": "Was she not horribly bedizened with velvet and pearls, with velvet and pearls, too, which had been torn off her back?",
  "1597": "Why should you have?",
  "1598": "What would you do yourself?",
  "1599": "How do you mean, forgotten?",
  "1600": "D'Imfreville?",
  "1601": "To get more knocks?",
  "1602": "Could it be possible, he continued, that eyes which as they gazed never expressed any divergence from what the tongue was telling, were yet ever seeing another world behind her ostensible one, discordant and contrasting?",
  "1603": "Hulloa, where have you sprung from?",
  "1604": "What can I say?",
  "1605": "But what can we do with him?",
  "1606": "To encourage him to continue poaching?",
  "1607": "Then why do people go there?",
  "1608": "Does any one scruple, in extraordinary cases, to violate all regard to the private property of individuals, and sacrifice to public interest a distinction which had been established for the sake of that interest?",
  "1609": "If the profits has turned out to be none, lackin' considable, and none to carry, is it my fault any more'n it's yourn?",
  "1610": "Lily, will you be mine?",
  "1611": "How can it be?",
  "1612": "Do you reckon you can learn me?",
  "1613": "What do you want to do?",
  "1614": "Might I have a buttonhole first?",
  "1615": "Come, be a good boy, what's her name?",
  "1616": "My sister stolen away?",
  "1617": "But do you not by every means encourage the superstition among those of the outside world?",
  "1618": "Never forgive me?",
  "1619": "Is there another wheelwright?",
  "1620": "Trading, how?",
  "1621": "Do you see ?",
  "1622": "If he acted as he did it was because he loved me, was it not?",

  "1637": "Why watch me?",
  "1638": "Have we any chance of escape, captain?",
  "1639": "What could I do when he reminded me that I could not keep my parish unless certain sums were paid?",
  "1640": "Then how you going to know which one to go for?",
  "1641": "What else should I have done with the stuff?",
  "1642": "What was he to say to this?",
  "1643": "What are we here for at all?",
  "1644": "But suppose we were to drink a mouthful in the mean time, for this air is stifling?",
  "1645": "Indeed, is it likely that a people with so many names has any actual existence?",
  "1646": "Has she any family?",
  "1647": "But was it not a star?",
  "1648": "And what was that saying about thyself?",

  "3835": "Or until he sends for me?",
  "3836": "At what?",
  "3837": "Yet what is it, but a lovely woman chiding, with sweet austere composure, the lover for whose affection she is grateful, but whose vices she reprobates?",

  "4604": "Murdstone?",
  "4605": "How say you, sir?",
  "4606": "Do you want me to pay you in advance?",
  "4607": "And what would you get as an assistant?",
  "4608": "Shall we consecrate our lives to him that he may hide our life in his life?",
  "4609": "You, monsieur?",
  "4610": "But would a number of men have put themselves to the superfluous trouble of taking down a fence, for the purpose of dragging through it a corpse which they might have lifted over any fence in an instant?",
  "4611": "And who will the money go to, doctor?",
  "4612": "All?",
  "4613": "Does my great love mean nothing to you at all?",
  "4614": "Like it?",
  "4615": "And you did not tell the king so?",
  "4616": "Lane?",
  "4617": "From whom did it come else?",
  "4618": "Do you still prefer going away yourself to my leaving you?",
  "4619": "Am I not here?",
  "4620": "Where do you want him?",
  "4621": "Why did I bind myself to her?",
  "4622": "What, then, is there surprising in that?",
  "4623": "Did he die?",
  "4624": "How was she?",
  "4625": "Now about tonight?",
  "4626": "You went there in obedience to a letter of instructions?",
  "4627": "Who is he?",
  "4628": "Why do you return so early?",
  "4629": "Lots of tin, I suppose, eh?",
  "4630": "At the anvil?",
  "4631": "Asked him for?",
  "4632": "But what has this to do with the picture?",
  "4633": "What's the matter with you girls?",
  "4634": "Then why do they quarrel?",
  "4635": "Can we then for a moment believe that, if this had been so, tradition would have been absolutely silent on the matter?",
  "4636": "Is the power of declaring war necessary?",
  "4637": "Even if he enjoys peace and a truce with you and all your men, what matters that to me?",
  "4638": "The last governess?",
  "4639": "I wonder if that will have a good effect?",
  "4640": "What horrible place are we in?",
  "4641": "Then there is no revenge?",
  "4642": "Do you imagine such a thing?",
  "4643": "You will do for me what you have done for the queen?",
  "4644": "Have you lived with the family long?",
  "4645": "Want to break up the line?",
  "4646": "Mercy, did you say?",
  "4647": "How is SHE?",
  "4648": "You saw me, perhaps, on the night of the convict hunt, when I was so imprudent as to allow the moon to rise behind me?",
  "4649": "Where are the gloves?",
  "4650": "Am I to understand that you say you love me?",
  "4651": "Is that clear?",
  "4652": "How be ye?",
  "4653": "Ah, by my crown, what's that?",
  "4654": "Are you glad to see me?",
  "4655": "What is our life but the very worst life?",
  "4656": "Well, what is to be done?",
  "4657": "Badly made up?",
  "4658": "What would happen?",
  "4659": "But, once more, how is that my fault?",
  "4660": "Until now?",
  "4661": "Is he an old offender?",
  "4662": "Which of these do we take?",
  "4663": "What old cove?",
  "4664": "Do you want us to fling ourselves headlong down these rocks?",
  "4665": "How long shall they wield unlawful power?",
  "4666": "What do you make of the other?",
  "4667": "In what figure shall I give his heart the first impression?",
  "4668": "The inquiry being only into the circumstances touching the death of the deceased, it's not necessary to go beyond these facts, I suppose you'll agree?",
  "4669": "Have you knocked at that one?",
  "4670": "Today, this moment?",
  "4671": "Or had he in reality always been like this, commonplace and prosaic, and was it merely in her imagination that he had been wonderful?",
  "4672": "Have you only just come?",
  "4673": "What man?",
  "4674": "Why do the women wear these things?",
  "4675": "Given the laboratories, how are the investigators to be maintained?",
  "4676": "All ready there?",
  "4677": "Why should we not leave together?",
  "4678": "What did you do then, sir?",
  "4679": "What was the ebb and flow of this tragic meditation?",
  "4680": "Then you want me to go back there?",
  "4681": "But do they do right in ignoring the existence of violence and bloodshed in resistance to constituted authority?",
  "4682": "Harness, but how can I harness everything?",
  "4683": "How cruel is your goodness?",
  "4684": "But what good will it do?",
  "4685": "What will protect him?",
  "4686": "How can I be sure of this?",
  "4687": "What's death?",
  "4688": "What was amiss?",
  "4689": "Where are you going to dine then?",
  "4690": "What could you do?",
  "4691": "If he could not do it, and if, nevertheless, it behoved them to break off this match, by whom was it to be done if not by her?",
  "4692": "A monkey, then?",
  "4693": "Have you any idea who did?",
  "4694": "Who made the lemonade?",
  "4695": "How shall he stop all the holes and deliver himself from the vipers?",
  "4696": "And why should that particular hole in the ground have anything to do with it?",
  "4697": "Why did the doctor's wife give the clerk presents?",
  "4698": "Am I doing anything?",
  "4699": "What did you think?",
  "4700": "Is it all you expected of it?",
  "4701": "What is it that you know?",
  "4702": "Do you not think so?",
  "4703": "Is, then, the crown too heavy that I wear?",
  "4704": "Does he want to protect himself, or does he think I would not go alone?",
  "4705": "Has law and order come down to this?",
  "4706": "And have you had a good bonfire up there?",
  "4707": "What is the economical meaning of wages?",
  "4708": "What do we want of a saw?",
  "4709": "Shall I sew, read, cone, draw, or do all at once?",
  "4710": "How call you the fountain?",
  "4711": "Yea?",
  "4712": "Who would be left?",
  "4713": "And, if so, how far into the future should we look?",
  "4714": "You have seen inside, then?",
  "4715": "And what did I do?",
  "4716": "What good will it do?",
  "4717": "Would you let me fetch another pat of butter, ma'am?",
  "4718": "Where's some brandy?",
  "4719": "Do you think he'll do it?",
  "4720": "Or will a not fail when he does come?",
  "4721": "Has there been any mistake, has she been buried alive?",
  "4722": "Yes, why was it that he had not married?",
  "4723": "Have I not indeed been living in a dream?",
  "4724": "But you, my poor child?",
  "4725": "Who could resist the pleading of so wise and compassionate a judge?",
  "4726": "How long are you staying?",
  "4727": "What on earth is the matter with the boy?",
  "4728": "I said just now, what good could come of it?",
  "4729": "May be a fraud?",
  "4730": "What's an engagement made of, do you suppose?",
  "4731": "I suppose you will be glad of variety and admiration?",
  "4732": "Do you think you can recover your lord by giving away thus to your grief?",
  "4733": "But where is the use?",
  "4734": "You're not going?",
  "4735": "With no work to do, nobody to worry us, and nobody to compete with?",
  "4736": "I know I've had it a long time, but where did I get it?",
  "4737": "Is she alone?",
  "4738": "What had taken place during this long sleep?",
  "4739": "When, finally, he was graduated a captain as well as a soldier, to what object should he address his efforts?",
  "4740": "Am I, or am I not, the queen?",
  "4741": "Could he do what he wanted to with the dollar?",
  "4742": "Because they give fevers?",
  "4743": "Where is she that I loved, the woman with eyes like stars?",
  "4744": "Now, then, mum?",
  "4745": "Who by?",
  "4746": "How can they laugh, or even live at all here?",
  "4747": "Who came here the last time?",
  "4748": "But what color can the objection have, when a specification of the objects alluded to by these general terms immediately follows, and is not even separated by a longer pause than a semicolon?",
  "4749": "What about poaching eggs?",
  "4750": "You know not the subject of their conversation?",
  "4751": "You would not fight a duel?",
  "4752": "Worth it, the little sacrifice, for whom?",
  "4753": "Is my son dead or unhorsed or so wounded that he cannot help himself?",
  "4754": "What about those rings you told me of?",
  "4755": "Little bamboos that creak together, tell me where he ran?",
  "4756": "Want a pilot, captain?",
  "4757": "There, what do you think now of the affair?",
  "4758": "Was there anything in your letter which might have unbalanced him or induced him to take such a step?",
  "4759": "How long was I what they called out of my senses?",
  "4760": "I am having a great holiday, am I not?",
  "4761": "In what strain should he do so?",
  "4762": "What was their case?",
  "4763": "Was your sister dressed?",
  "4764": "Where has he gone?",
  "4765": "What does it signify?",
  "4766": "And what did he do the rest of his time?",
  "4767": "What do you mean, then?",
  "4768": "You're not angry that I sent for you?",
  "4769": "Might I have a word with your lordship?",
  "4770": "But what had been in the box?",
  "4771": "May I prove my gratitude by explaining for once where my difficulty lies?",
  "4772": "And do you suppose, madam, that he would have no money left?",
  "4773": "Do you not see that all these soldiers of ours have been raised by us to the pitch of expectation?",
  "4774": "I afraid?",
  "4775": "Did you ever love such an one?",
  "4776": "And will the head's being bare cure the madness of yours?",
  "4777": "Is it worth while?",
  "4778": "Will you be good enough to come and see me?",
  "4779": "She is ready, is she?",
  "4780": "From whom else could they come?",
  "4781": "You do not need that name in order to live?",

  "4784": "Was he one of those two passengers?",
  "4785": "What is to become of us?",
  "4786": "Give every one their due, eh?",
  "4787": "What stone wall?",
  "4788": "How could I adore her more if I were married to one of the people you speak of?",
  "4789": "Do you think so?",
  "4790": "By what oaths can he bind himself?",
  "4791": "Will monseigneur have the kindness to say for what purpose?",
  "4792": "Of what burden is she?",
  "4793": "Do I amuse you?",
  "4794": "Come, is that enough, mamma, or do you intend to put any more questions?",
  "4795": "A lost art?",
  "4796": "Are you one of his men?",
  "4797": "Criminals?",
  "4798": "Who was the he?",
  "4799": "Why did you wish to stop my ears?",
  "4800": "Have you forgiven me?",
  "4801": "Will you refuse to do as I wish?",
  "4802": "Well, what did he talk about with you?",
  "4803": "Where is the forest man who went to rescue you?",
  "4804": "And what is the time limit for such reactions?",
  "4805": "But if, in the dawn of life, we could soberly survey the scenes before us as in perspective, and see every thing in its true colours, how could the passions gain sufficient strength to unfold the faculties?",
  "4806": "Will you not speak to me?",
  "4807": "What hour?",
  "4808": "What has brought him here at this time?",
  "4809": "I think I saw you in the park riding?",
  "4810": "Are we not?",
  "4811": "Why should love be a bond?",
  "4812": "And if you found him deserting to your enemies, what would you do?",
  "4813": "Who could have told you that?",
  "4814": "Why do we not arrive?",
  "4815": "Then, after all, it was given to me by the dean?",
  "4816": "May I have her at my party?",
  "4817": "But who said it was buried alive?",
  "4818": "May I call tomorrow?",
  "4819": "What was that?",
  "4820": "My wish?",
  "4821": "What's to do naow?",
  "4822": "I ask you, sir, how dare you do it?",
  "4823": "What have you gained?",
  "4824": "How have we handled our national finances?",
  "4825": "But if he be willing to accept my offers, will you oppose them?",
  "4826": "The next question of anxiety was, where would the balloon alight?",
  "4827": "She?",
  "4828": "How could you sing, sing like that while crying?",
  "4829": "My line?",
  "4830": "But will it hurt me?",
  "4831": "So you want to marry?",
  "4832": "Where did you get those louis d'or?",
  "4833": "How is that, my friend?",
  "4834": "Can destiny, then, be as malicious as an intelligent being, and become as monstrous as the human heart?",
  "4835": "What difference does that make?",
  "4836": "Would you be able to recognize that man again?",
  "4837": "And who the devil gave YOU leave to touch a stick about the place?",
  "4838": "You supposed he should have hung himself indeed?",
  "4839": "Of what kind were they?",
  "4840": "Have you a brother?",
  "4841": "Can you tell how?",
  "4842": "What the devil do you come in between me and my dog for?",
  "4843": "Did you see?",
  "4844": "I presume then that you are going to make one of the interdicted answers?",
  "4845": "And I?",
  "4846": "And good counsel is clearly a kind of knowledge, for not by ignorance, but by knowledge, do men counsel well?",
  "4847": "Do you understand me?",
  "4848": "Have not almost all the governments in the world always been in the wrong on religious subjects?",
  "4849": "Why do you make so much noise?",
  "4850": "Against whom?",
  "4851": "What was to be done in the rural districts?",
  "4852": "Ah, how many inhabitants could it support?",
  "4853": "And which to the mortal?",
  "4854": "But what do you make of the grandmother?",
  "4855": "How have we offended?",
  "4856": "And what about her?",
  "4857": "What business have you here?",
  "4858": "Is it just?",
  "4859": "What is that you say, my friend?",
  "4860": "Do you really?",
  "4861": "But what sort of a man was he?",
  "4862": "No use?",
  "4863": "Your real name you will not give?",
  "4864": "Has he not compounded a riddle, thinking to try me?",
  "4865": "And what shall we say about men?",
  "4866": "Have you no shame?",
  "4867": "Why weep you not to think upon my wrongs?",
  "4868": "Stranger, what is it?",
  "4869": "What shall I suffer and endure?",
  "4870": "Maybe you'll be very lonely, ma'am?",
  "4871": "What is it, little girl?",
  "4872": "But may not the tradition of it have descended from the discovery of comparatively late remains, by primitive man, of the winged saurians that crawled, swam, dived, or flew, lingering on till the later geologic period?",
  "4873": "The lady, sir?",
  "4874": "Oats?",
  "4875": "How long could they keep the pace?",
  "4876": "His uncle had deceived him, and might he not consign her to some miserable place where her youth and beauty would prove a far greater curse than ugliness and decrepitude?",
  "4877": "Who do you wish to see?",
  "4878": "How long is this for?",
  "4879": "What conceivable motive had they for doing so?",
  "4880": "Which way is the business part?",
  "4881": "And dressed?",
  "4882": "Why, cousin?",
  "4883": "Make you feel rotten?",
  "4884": "Do I ever take pains to have any secrets?",
  "4885": "Did you ever see her?",
  "4886": "How do you like my entrance?",
  "4887": "Can you rest here?",
  "4888": "Cruel?",
  "4889": "Will you never do anything?",
  "4890": "Beneath it?",
  "4891": "Is such a thing possible?",
  "4892": "Sorry for whom?",
  "4893": "Your leagues concluded, your engagements past?",
  "4894": "Why does he not come himself?",
  "4895": "Is anything the matter?",
  "4896": "Of what misdemeanor do you accuse him?",
  "4897": "And who did it?",
  "4898": "Only think what you are giving up here?",
  "4899": "And what would you call her?",
  "4900": "The boy is out, you say?",
  "4901": "What can make her amends for this privation, or where is she to seek for a fresh employment?",
  "4902": "But what's the southern army to do?",
  "4903": "What was passing in that brain, so loaded with dreadful secrets?",
  "4904": "Are you sure she said that?",
  "4905": "I do not know whether you have heard the whole story?",
  "4906": "How near were you?",
  "4907": "Surprise?",
  "4908": "And why should you object?",
  "4909": "But what are men?",
  "4910": "It that noble?",
  "4911": "Oh, what shall I call you?",
  "4912": "Will you come out with me again one evening?",
  "4913": "Then who is supporting you there?",
  "4914": "What is the difference, then, between the two customs?",
  "4915": "I wonder, captain, what they will say of my going away, ha?",
  "4916": "In such a world as this, what is the use of the enjoyment of pleasures, if he who has fed on them is to return to this world again and again?",
  "4917": "Why did you introduce a defective bill?",
  "4918": "And why then have you tempted me?",
  "4919": "And his name?",
  "4920": "Did he get well?",
  "4921": "Lend me a hanky, will you?",
  "4922": "Would you know how to buy it, my darling?",
  "4923": "When the tongue of an advocate once gets in motion, who can tell where it will stop?",

  "4928": "Of what consequence?",
  "4929": "Would you like me to get out the books now that your grandmother is going to give you for your birthday?",
  "4930": "What is it, then?",
  "4931": "Well, how are you?",
  "4932": "You've come back, have you?",
  "4933": "Now, if I grant that they cannot be employed in the sphere of experience, as constitutive principles, how shall I secure for them employment and objective validity as regulative principles, and in what way can they be so employed?",
  "4934": "How long have you had that cough ?",
  "4935": "Would you turn their distress into a malediction?",
  "4936": "Of what did the plebeians complain?",
  "4937": "Giry, do you know what is in this envelope?",
  "4938": "Are you sure of this?",
  "4939": "Or five?",
  "4940": "But how about the wine?",

  "4950": "A wa'at for me?",
  "4951": "Was there enough ice?",
  "4952": "But where will they lead us to?",
  "4953": "A fright?",
  "4954": "How can I help that, my boy?",
  "4955": "Can you have become untrue to your own heart?",
  "4956": "How then, sir, can I act, but by shewing my abhorrence of every step that makes towards my undoing?",
  "4957": "And you will not turn aside as you did just now?",
  "4958": "How is it?",
  "4959": "Said he, what's the matter?",
  "4960": "And was it not the manly thing for him to do?",
  "4961": "Was that kind?",
  "4962": "Is ever disaster nearer than when each solider thinks about his private safety only?",
  "4963": "Are you all clear, you, aft there?",
  "4964": "That is perhaps true, but what of it?",
  "4965": "Where may he be at present?",
  "4966": "Menneville, what do you want to do?",

  "4974": "Oh, you're the new articled clerk?",
  "4975": "What right thing?",
  "4976": "Stendhal?",
  "4977": "Will you go?",
  "4978": "Why, then, do you fear them?",
  "4979": "O how shall I know this?",
  "4980": "You want to see who they are?",
  "4981": "What stayed them?",
  "4982": "And I've got a tremendous will, have I?",
  "4983": "Oh, something in a philanthropic way?",
  "4984": "Oh, but how was it?",
  "4985": "But where are we drifting?",
  "4986": "But what were our managers doing?",

  "5007": "Have you anything interesting there?",
  "5008": "And you found yourselves suddenly on a mountain side?",
  "5009": "Why do you ever come back, then, at all?",
  "5010": "Will that be all?",
  "5011": "But what did I want crawling forward to scorch my understanding at her flaming brow?",
  "5012": "But if there were somewhere a being strong and beautiful, a valiant nature, full at once of exaltation and refinement, a poet's heart in an angel's form, a lyre with sounding chords ringing out elegiac epithalamia to heaven, why, perchance, should she not find him?",
  "5013": "You have only lately arrived?",
  "5014": "I shall have the comte's letter in eight hours?",

  "5339": "Would he have drawn back?",
  "5340": "Why must he go around hunting for some one who is supporting me or has supported me at some time in his life, and who has said something at some time contrary to that platform?",
  "5341": "Had ever a queen such a throne before?",
  "5342": "And what do YOU want?",
  "5343": "Or was he a debtor or a debtor's son?",

  "6479": "I come for my girl, see?",
  "6480": "Do you then make nothing at all of her having been so ready to leave us?",
  "6481": "For what do good men who make the best soldiers fight?",
  "6482": "What is your last name again, say you?",
  "6483": "He was not the first that had played away a few trifles, and of what use were birth and fortune if they would not admit some sallies and expenses?",
  "6484": "Would not a peer who, by chance of fortune, might suddenly be driven to herd among the navvies be as afraid of the jeers of his companions, as would any navvy suddenly exalted to a seat among the peers?",
  "6485": "Is it me you want?",
  "6486": "And this lady?",
  "6487": "Object to him, guardian?",
  "6488": "How would you like to be shut up for hours with a nervous, fussy old lady, who keeps you trotting, is never satisfied, and worries you till you you're ready to fly out the window or cry?",

  "7470": "Of course she must give him an answer, but how would she give it?",
  "7471": "What makes you put so much butter on the steak?",
  "7472": "You say you are this young lady's brother?",
  "7473": "Why is it that you doubt my word?",
  "7474": "You put me off, do you?",
  "7475": "No one observes us?",
  "7476": "And what will you say to them?",
  "7477": "What can they be doing inside?",
  "7478": "And what do you think of her personal appearance?",
  "7479": "And you will obey me, will you not?",
  "7480": "Have you any objection to my looking at your register?",
  "7481": "Or would the meteor prove too powerful for it?",
  "7482": "Could she be dreaming?",
  "7483": "We do seem to make a little progress, do we not?",
  "7484": "Where's the use of asking for such fellows' reasons?",
  "7485": "But what do you believe?",
  "7486": "I can work, then?",
  "7487": "Now what say you to a pasty, or a strip of beef cut where the juice runs, and maybe the half of a broiled fowl?",
  "7488": "How can you ask me?",
  "7489": "And is the sum you bring me worth the trouble?",
  "7490": "How do you feel this morning?",
  "7491": "Where can you live?",
  "7492": "Where is that?",
  "7493": "Why do you point away?",
  "7494": "Or do they fall short of this perfect equality in a measure?",
  "7495": "How had I deserved to be so blessed by such confessions?",
  "7496": "Is not this rather an ad hominem style of argument?",
  "7497": "When does the projectile start?",
  "7498": "And that one yonder?",
  "7499": "In vain I ask the air and the trees why I should not drown myself?",
  "7500": "Why did he not speak?",
  "7501": "Jarvie?",
  "7502": "I wonder why you ever fell in love with me?",
  "7503": "Tell us then boldly, what we must do for you?",
  "7504": "It will not scratch and claw, but pet and comfort?",
  "7505": "Doth it not strike you as being passing strange that the land is not filled with couriers and proclamations describing my person and making search for me?",
  "7506": "How does she live?",
  "7507": "Who stole my bread?",
  "7508": "Were we to die as he had done?",
  "7509": "Is it then surprising, that when the sole ambition of woman centres in beauty, and interest gives vanity additional force, perpetual rivalships should ensue?",
  "7510": "Then what on earth are they up to?",
  "7511": "Why do I come to you thus?",
  "7512": "You will ask me why I did not dispose of it?",
  "7513": "What have you to say now?",
  "7514": "Do you mean, were we talking about diamonds?",
  "7515": "Shall I carry no message, madame?",
  "7516": "Would any man weary of it, or wish to turn away his eyes?",
  "7517": "What am I to say to him?",
  "7518": "What more can he do?",
  "7519": "But who can be angry at those assiduities which are meant to please him?",
  "7520": "Does that kind go smoothly?",
  "7521": "Does it hurt?",
  "7522": "Where are you, old fellow?",
  "7523": "And have quite forgiven me?",
  "7524": "Did I say a word when he came and took me away, for no earthly reason, from the place where everybody was kind to me?",
  "7525": "How did you know it, then?",
  "7526": "Burning up your awld aunt's rubbidge, I suppose?",
  "7527": "Which room shall we do first?",
  "7528": "Mine?",
  "7529": "You would not make him a cuckold?",
  "7530": "Has he brought back the prisoners?",
  "7531": "For what does reason discover, when it pronounces any action vicious?",
  "7532": "But why should you want to paint me?",
  "7533": "What do you wish?",
  "7534": "Why is the workingman prohibited from charging a like interest for his capital, which is himself?",
  "7535": "Are you ashamed of it?",
  "7536": "But you expected some one then?",
  "7537": "And did he spring clean from the mark or had he to get off with a push?",
  "7538": "You did not see her?",
  "7539": "Tell me what should you say, darling?",
  "7540": "But, in the name of heaven, man, where did you get these extraordinary clothes?",
  "7541": "You say you heard a knocking?",
  "7542": "But what is to be done now?",
  "7543": "But how did you feel when you were loved by a servant?",
  "7544": "Dobbin?",
  "7545": "Will you set them fighting still further, or will you make peace between them?",
  "7546": "Think we're liable to have much trouble?",
  "7547": "You've brought it, have you?",
  "7548": "What think you my friend did?",
  "7549": "And what imports this?",
  "7550": "Biribi?",
  "7551": "What more did I want?",
  "7552": "In the middle of the performance?",
  "7553": "What in the world can be more ridiculous than commercial laws carried out to one's own detriment?",
  "7554": "With THEM?",
  "7555": "And why do we fuss and fume sometimes?",
  "7556": "But why would you return to face again the fierce banth, or whatever other form of destruction they have loosed within that awful trap?",
  "7557": "Do you know what my private and candid opinion is about some of those little jokers?",
  "7558": "What'll he do with it?",
  "7559": "But what next?",
  "7560": "The letter about the mortgage has come, has it?",
  "7561": "You like it so, I suppose?",
  "7562": "A robber maybe?",
  "7563": "And why do you serve?",
  "7564": "Must he see, must he know?",
  "7565": "Do they denote or connote anything?",
  "7566": "Do you, then, really return?",
  "7567": "What a temptin lookin critter you'd be among the galls, would'nt you?",
  "7568": "Think only, what are my children to be?",
  "7569": "You were not content to hear me, eh?",
  "7570": "What have I done that this burden should be laid on me?",
  "7571": "Will you bet?",
  "7572": "What did he give for that picture upstairs which the young man painted?",
  "7573": "Is not our fortune famous, brave, and great?",
  "7574": "Are you so daintily brought up, you cannot eat your own flesh?",
  "7575": "Did you see that one?",
  "7576": "Why shall I not tell the rabbis on you?",
  "7577": "Will you come up?",
  "7578": "How can you show me that you are telling the truth?",
  "7579": "What do you call it?",
  "7580": "Where is your sash, my dear?",
  "7581": "And to whom?",
  "7582": "How long would he be left uneducated?",
  "7583": "Only you here?",
  "7584": "Do you wish me to beg pardon of this creature because she has come here to insult our mother and disgrace the whole household, you low, base wretch?",
  "7585": "And the desire which goes beyond this, or more delicate food, or other luxuries, which might generally be got rid of, if controlled and trained in youth, and is hurtful to the body, and hurtful to the soul in the pursuit of wisdom and virtue, may be rightly called unnecessary?",
  "7586": "Ah, naughty, naughty, would you take a nip at the gentleman?",
  "7587": "What does the presence do?",
  "7588": "Who would not suffer amid perfumed tapestries, cushioned furniture, and liveried servants?",
  "7589": "Well, and how are you?",
  "7590": "Yet who else in all the world was there with the strength and agility to do what this man was now doing?",
  "7591": "Why be uneasy?",
  "7592": "So you are going to sell the place?",
  "7593": "Is he still in a fit?",
  "7594": "But heavens, why?",
  "7595": "What might you be able to do?",
  "7596": "Music?",
  "7597": "There is then more than one who might await you there?",
  "7598": "What's the matter with your tooth?",
  "7599": "Can she have it today?",
  "7600": "Well, who is my benefactor?",
  "7601": "Why so, if you please?",
  "7602": "Where is the man who was here?",
  "7603": "Who again was his closest ally?",
  "7604": "What is your history?",
  "7605": "Is he ill?",
  "7606": "Are you coming tomorrow?",
  "7607": "How now?",
  "7608": "For the best?",
  "7609": "Count 'em?",
  "7610": "And did you convey this answer to your guest?",
  "7611": "By after 'all' you mean after she's in love with somebody else?",
  "7612": "Did you ever see such a den, my dear?",
  "7613": "Yet why are those names disgraceful?",
  "7614": "Not damn the sharper, but the dice?",
  "7615": "And what IS her idea?",
  "7616": "Do you feel inclined to make the monks' acquaintance once more?",
  "7617": "What do you find to attract you in this poor drab little country?",
  "7618": "Are they little, then?",
  "7619": "What are you thinking about, doctor?",
  "7620": "Is it that the poets are deliberately trying to present the conditions of an age anterior to their own?",
  "7621": "What do you want me for, sir?",
  "7622": "Who spoke of such a thing?",
  "7623": "Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?",
  "7624": "What, my rival?",
  "7625": "My little lady, where are you going to?",
  "7626": "What can it mean?",
  "7627": "Would you counsel him to do so?",
  "7628": "Shall I also smite them dead?",
  "7629": "Bah, really?",
  "7630": "You dispute me?",
  "7631": "May I ask what led to this change?",
  "7632": "Why not a fortnight from now?",
  "7633": "What means this shouting in the house?",
  "7634": "And shall disaffection only be rewarded with security?",
  "7635": "Where else will one find a more happy union of magnificence and comfort, where better arrangements to facilitate commerce?",
  "7636": "May I ask why that date?",
  "7637": "Did you get him?",
  "7638": "Is conduct everything?",
  "7639": "You have, then, a repugnance to your profession?",
  "7640": "What could be the matter?",
  "7641": "Where is the doctor?",
  "7642": "Who'll stop me?",
  "7643": "Then will you not forgive me?",
  "7644": "Would you like to speak to him?",
  "7645": "Well, how is he?",
  "7646": "Why not own your own home?",
  "7647": "Was he angry, or pleased?",
  "7648": "But how discover what demands are just?",
  "7649": "Snow?",
  "7650": "How many miles?",
  "7651": "What sort of legislators were they?",
  "7652": "As he was to finish reading there, why not set out at once?",
  "7653": "Does she love me?",
  "7654": "Then, why did you think of giving your daughter to him?",
  "7655": "Are they out beanfeasting?",
  "7656": "Is it not that we may enjoy our liberty?",
  "7657": "Whither else?",
  "7658": "How then shall I take away these opinions?",
  "7659": "You are hurt?",
  "7660": "Any occasion to show my papers?",
  "7661": "What are you laughing at, husband?",
  "7662": "And what could he say to her?",
  "7663": "What does it matter to me?",
  "7664": "But surely you would not wish to offend the bishop?",
  "7665": "Can this be my whole purpose?",
  "7666": "What did she know of this strange creature at her side?",
  "7667": "Pyramids?",
  "7668": "What is ther to do, now?",
  "7669": "How did you begin?",
  "7670": "When I heard her dismiss the footman, I stepped up to him and asked him, what little lady that was?",
  "7671": "You may ask, by what authority do I venture, being a person not concerned in the practice of medicine, to meddle with that subject?",
  "7672": "And what do you wonder?",
  "7673": "So I's to gouge out all their eyes, eh?",
  "7674": "What was it about?",
  "7675": "And the hyperbola?",
  "7676": "And in what city did you live?",
  "7677": "Are you not ashamed to speak to a wretch lying on the stones?",
  "7678": "Can I do anything for you?",
  "7679": "Yet how many people have I hated in my life?",
  "7680": "Will you take a chair?",
  "7681": "And straightway hereupon, arose the natural question of cui bono?",
  "7682": "Could that girl have been playing off any of her coquettish tricks?",
  "7683": "What was I to say?",
  "7684": "Where are you damn'd?",
  "7685": "Do you care to pursue further?",
  "7686": "You take me?",
  "7687": "What could I do but follow him?",
  "7688": "So why was she surprised?",
  "7689": "Will they be here long?",
  "7690": "What means this violence in my house?",
  "7691": "You are quite aware of that?",
  "7692": "There is to be no doubt about that, is there?",
  "7693": "What mean you?",
  "7694": "The first question is, whether a government, proposing to itself the propagation of religious truth as one of its principal ends, is more likely to lead the people right than to lead them wrong?",
  "7695": "And what if they were friends, brethren, countrymen?",
  "7696": "Have we not thieves enow among us already?",
  "7697": "Shall I ring for them to carry you down?",
  "7698": "Is it a blaspheming clause or reserve any way scandalous unto the world?",
  "7699": "And who is this woman?",
  "7700": "What are we to fight about?",
  "7701": "And how then?",
  "7702": "Where's he going to?",
  "7703": "Do you know how my little brother is, sir?",
  "7704": "Would you like to go to school?",
  "7705": "What's a ransom?",
  "7706": "Anything wanting to the bonnet?",
  "7707": "Indeed, even apart from an analogy, is it not mighty interesting to narrate, anyway?",
  "7708": "But was I free to claim this liberty?",
  "7709": "Is he hanging somewhere?",
  "7710": "The bear?",
  "7711": "What time is it?",
  "7712": "Straker?",
  "7713": "Oh, he is, is he?",
  "7714": "Do you know the depth of the ocean?",
  "7715": "What can I do for you?",
  "7716": "Do you dare to die?",
  "7717": "Long from home?",
  "7718": "What have you done, indeed?",
  "7719": "Would the gentleman like this room?",
  "7720": "Can I drop you anywhere?",
  "7721": "Was it some midnight assassin who had come to carry out the murderous orders of the secret tribunal?",
  "7722": "But is this all that is known?",
  "7723": "Did you see?",
  "7724": "Now, maiden, before this wedding continues, whom will you have to husband?",
  "7725": "Why that word virtuous, said he, I pray you?",
  "7726": "What was it you did say to the archbishop?",
  "7727": "Is that letter for me?",
  "7728": "To set off to see her again?",
  "7729": "Ought I to be angry with her for being faithful to him?",
  "7730": "And the waiters, yea, and the inns at which they waited, and the cold rounds of beef inside, and the stunted ostler, with his blue nose and clinking pail, where is he, and where is his generation?",
  "7731": "Will not the reasons which indicate the propriety of this arrangement strongly plead for an admission of the other branch of that body to a share of the inquiry?",
  "7732": "Before I close may I say a few words upon two topics, much discussed out of doors, upon which it is highly important that our judgment should be clear, definite, and steadfast?",
  "7733": "What shall I do?",
  "7734": "What would you say, sir squire, to my having such a great natural instinct in judging wines that you have only to let me smell one and I can tell positively its country, its kind, its flavour and soundness, the changes it will undergo, and everything that appertains to a wine?",
  "7735": "Do you know this girl that your friend has made himself a fool about?",
  "7736": "Did you get my hedgehog?",
  "7737": "And what would you do?",
  "7738": "Do you know that he loves YOU, yet?",
  "7739": "Whither so fast?",
  "7740": "Sonya, what is the matter with you?",
  "7741": "Why should he die?",
  "7742": "Are you off?",
  "7743": "How like you him?",
  "7744": "Who, in the situation in which the world has placed me, has a right to require more at my hands?",
  "7745": "Why do you ask with such alarm?",
  "7746": "Where could he hope to find this powerful help?",
  "7747": "Will you come out with me?",
  "7748": "Who did that there?",
  "7749": "What would you that I should reply?",
  "7750": "And are you trying to keep it from me?",
  "7751": "Will you go to the ship in the boat?",
  "7752": "Does that satisfy you?",
  "7753": "The horrible punishment to which you have condemned me for the last six years?",
  "7754": "She had asked him whether the tyrant was soon to pass that way?",
  "7755": "Men in this place?",
  "7756": "To whom did you say?",
  "7757": "To make your will?",
  "7758": "What's the use of making mysteries?",
  "7759": "Do you take a middle course?",
  "7760": "And are you going to run away before you have fairly taught or learned whether they are true or not?",
  "7761": "Did you catch a glimpse of the towns on its borders?",
  "7762": "And pray what IS my position, madame?",
  "7763": "What has he against me?",
  "7764": "What can a fellow do with a fellow like that?",
  "7765": "Attentive?",
  "7766": "Are you in a great hurry?",
  "7767": "But that I feare?",
  "7768": "Corky around?",
  "7769": "Gone?",
  "7770": "Was I convinced of the truth of what I had heard?",
  "7771": "How would the papers talk about it?",
  "7772": "She could pity, or sacrifice herself, or have instincts, but had she ever loved in the noblest way, where man and woman, having lost themselves in sex, desire to lose sex itself in comradeship?",
  "7773": "Now, what theory could justify these perpetual hecatombs?",
  "7774": "A family gathering, is it not, with these old fellows under us here?",
  "7775": "And can therefore neither be ignorance nor knowledge?",
  "7776": "Does the night arise?",
  "7777": "Do you like the position of it?",
  "7778": "May it not have been, that some species of insect upon which they fed had likewise migrated, and that certain noxious animalcules, which had been kept down by this class, had thus multiplied within the atmosphere until their numbers caused disease?",
  "7779": "But why should I not?",
  "7780": "Is it sooth?",
  "7781": "What right have you, monseigneur, to demand an account of my attachments and friendships?",
  "7782": "Can you think that that active brain was at rest during all those weary centuries, whilst her free soul was flitting from world to world amongst the boundless regions of the stars?",
  "7783": "Who the devil's that?",
  "7784": "Good?",
  "7785": "Officers, do you hear?",
  "7786": "Shall I guess?",
  "7787": "What has brought you here?",
  "7788": "Where can all the strength of those medicines go, my dear?",
  "7789": "Did you ever see such a binding?",
  "7790": "And shall we proceed to get rid of the weepings and wailings of famous men?",
  "7791": "Why, have you got into a scrape and want to know how he'll take it?",
  "7792": "Watch in hand?",
  "7793": "How do you find them?",
  "7794": "Are you going to read the paper next?",
  "7795": "Until I die?",
  "7796": "Why do you not work?",
  "7797": "Was there no other cheaper house to seek?",
  "7798": "How is this ?",
  "7799": "If we are drowned, will it not be drowned too?",
  "7800": "Or a fulfiller?",
  "7801": "Did you hear?",
  "7802": "And what are strength and courage?",
  "7803": "You are a brave people and you love bravery, but where was your mighty jeddak during the fighting today?",
  "7804": "Why are the people here?",
  "7805": "Who was the anonymous person, eh?",
  "7806": "Why are you laid up again?",
  "7807": "Single or married?",
  "7808": "What remained for her, but to train her children in her own views and sentiments?",
  "7809": "What brings you here, man?",
  "7810": "Was this a saner point of view than the one she had felt constrained to take when she arrived, through so much agony of renunciation, at her decision?",
  "7811": "But what is the truth?",
  "7812": "You give me the lie and will not draw your sword?",
  "7813": "And where do you live?",
  "7814": "Had she given up to heaven the pure soul of an old maid, the calm soul of a spouse, the tender one of a mother, or one moved by love?",
  "7815": "Can anyone who reads these lines form an idea of the effect this had upon us?",
  "7816": "Why, how came you to be so well acquainted with all this?",
  "7817": "Why should he respect any but himself?",
  "7818": "Will you eat a pudding?",
  "7819": "Will you wake me, before departing?",
  "7820": "What did you tell me?",
  "7821": "But if you have why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures?",
  "7822": "What end would that answer?",
  "7823": "What have you done to me?",
  "7824": "Why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them?",
  "7825": "Laurie, when are you going to your grandfather?",
  "7826": "Is the circumstance strange or novel?",
  "7827": "Do you call this a wedding?",
  "7828": "And it's that you'd call sport, is it, to be abroad in the darkness with yourself alone?",
  "7829": "Who could rescue him from that powerful pressure?",
  "7830": "What happened to her?",
  "7831": "Were the bulls short, with crooked legs?",
  "7832": "Already?",
  "7833": "Will he not also require natural aptitude for his calling?",
  "7834": "And does your ingratitude upbraid me for this?",
  "7835": "And you, you mountebank, what are you laughing at?",
  "7836": "Would she like it?",
  "7837": "Beak's order, eh?",
  "7838": "You suppose that I would ever accept the price of your life?",
  "7839": "What on earth am I going to do?",
  "7840": "What occasion could there be for moonlight in the daytime, and that too whilst the sun shined?",
  "7841": "So it was you, was it?",
  "7842": "And your handwriting?",
  "7843": "Have you any old elms?",
  "7844": "But what would your mamma say?",
  "7845": "In short, how do you know that such a reformation will be a benefit to man?",
  "7846": "New name?",
  "7847": "A comedie?",
  "7848": "Mine honorable freend?",
  "7849": "Surely it's not possible that you've begun to take anything seriously?",
  "7850": "What did he do with the case in his hands?",
  "7851": "Do you sleep or do you wake?",
  "7852": "Dreadful crimes?",
  "7853": "Did you know it then, mother?",
  "7854": "What is he contriving?",
  "7855": "What should he choose?",
  "7856": "May I come in?",
  "7857": "Have you quite made up your mind?",
  "7858": "What'll you give?",
  "7859": "Is this truth?",
  "7860": "How do THEY get them?",
  "7861": "How should a repetition of it be treated?",
  "7862": "The count's things?",
  "7863": "And what do they call your friend who is coming this evening?",
  "7864": "But how did the accident happen?",
  "7865": "D'you think the values are all right?",
  "7866": "Are all men like this?",
  "7867": "Is there anything else I can assist you in discovering, besides the villany of your friends?",
  "7868": "What do they come bothering for?",
  "7869": "Is it possible it can be he?",
  "7870": "What have we here?",
  "7871": "You heard nothing yourself last night?",
  "7872": "How much do you think I do?",
  "7873": "Or do they seem to imagine, that to them, as to other men, it must be the purchase either of sweat or of blood?",
  "7874": "Can they have quarrelled?",
  "7875": "Servant, what is this same, I pray you?",
  "7876": "Who's next?",

  "9549": "Who knows?",
  "9550": "Who was the lady thus celebrated?",
  "9551": "For why not?",
  "9552": "That is not a family name?",
  "9553": "Anybody here seen anything of any such game?",
  "9554": "Shortly?",
  "9555": "And you last saw him at eight o'clock last night?",
  "9556": "How much d'you think you're worth, eh?",
  "9557": "What was it altogether?",
  "9558": "Is not this a desperate state of things?",
  "9559": "Spartan?",
  "9560": "That is to say, you wish to lean on my arm, and yet to walk your own way?",
  "9561": "What is the basis of them all?",
  "9562": "So, sir, and what follows?",
  "9563": "What has become of your brother?",
  "9564": "What chance willed it?",
  "9565": "And that to which an end is appointed has also an excellence?",
  "9566": "What are your grandmother's symptoms?",
  "9567": "Did he put that to you as a justification?",
  "9568": "But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature?",
  "9569": "You mean that you do not understand the nature of this payment which to the best men is the great inducement to rule?",
  "9570": "How useless?",
  "9571": "Is this a joke, boys?",
  "9572": "But how can you be sure when you do meet the right one?",
  "9573": "What will be the judgment a century hence concerning the lauded works of our favorite composers today?",
  "9574": "I asked him, how they came to make that desperate attempt?",
  "9575": "But some official document was drawn up as to this affair, I suppose?",
  "9576": "Why should I hinder it?",
  "9577": "What do you mean by the rest of the time?",
  "9578": "You would meet the queen, and she would not know who you are?",
  "9579": "May I sit down for a minute?",
  "9580": "How do you do, my dear?",
  "9581": "Who is this that answers us?",
  "9582": "Will your lordship do me the honor to sup with me?",
  "9583": "What have you to say to me, that you could not say yonder as well as here?",
  "9584": "What had taken place in that soul?",
  "9585": "Have you the wick?",
  "9586": "Is that true or not?",
  "9587": "Porthos is wounded, then?",
  "9588": "But can you find your man?",
  "9589": "How do you do?",
  "9590": "But what do YOU want?",
  "9591": "What uses?",
  "9592": "Has a car gone through?",
  "9593": "Day after day went by, and what was he doing?",
  "9594": "How can we do justice to the pattern otherwise?",
  "9595": "But what sort of way?",
  "9596": "And uncle knows?",
  "9597": "I wonder what she's like?",
  "9598": "Whose pain can have been like mine?",
  "9599": "With what, then, has humanity to reproach my brother?",
  "9600": "And your honour, doubtless, wad consider the time and trouble?",
  "9601": "Could I by any chance have suspected it?",
  "9602": "Who taught me to be hard?",
  "9603": "And a bed got ready, and tea?",
  "9604": "What was the immediate result of the struggle of the communes and the king against the seigniors?",
  "9605": "You will take a cheque?",
  "9606": "Was it true that this curtain did move?",
  "9607": "It is now what?",
  "9608": "But, do you hear?",
  "9609": "Whittington, perhaps?",
  "9610": "What are they?",
  "9611": "Also to be soothed, and gently and reverently entreated when angry, even more than a father, and either to be persuaded, or if not persuaded, to be obeyed?",
  "9612": "Who's there?",
  "9613": "All loose?",
  "9614": "A great honour for me, is it not?",
  "9615": "Will you now be so good as to tell me with whom I have the honor of conversing so pleasantly, instead of being in the ambulance with that maniac's bullet in my body?",
  "9616": "What was the use of any anathema when he would only take it away, as a dog does a bone, and enjoy it in a solitary corner?",
  "9617": "Not the way to get on in life, you'll tell me?",
  "9618": "What resolution did he take?",
  "9619": "Whither have they gone, then?",
  "9620": "Surely it is not because she is so very anxious to find a husband?",
  "9621": "Do you know me, sir?",
  "9622": "How do you like them?",
  "9623": "How long shall I myself spend my blood drop by drop?",
  "9624": "Has she been wearing any of the emeralds, by the way?",
  "9625": "But what made you choose this place?",
  "9626": "Why should he not do the magnificent thing?",
  "9627": "What has it found?",
  "9628": "And what is there that can better deserve to be preserved?",
  "9629": "And you have a letter?",
  "9630": "And what do they teach you?",
  "9631": "And the fleet?",
  "9632": "Then how prove that we will as we do, because of the equivalence of the pleasure to the pain?",
  "9633": "You had better have a slice of ham or an egg, or something with your tea?",
  "9634": "Have you not heard?",
  "9635": "Would it be all right to telephone down to the office, or do you think it would be better to ring?",
  "9636": "But the bicycle?",
  "9637": "Could it be done?",
  "9638": "Is the dear old lady deaf?",
  "9639": "Had the man succeeded in making his escape?",
  "9640": "Can one drink to the sun's health, do you think, prince?",
  "9641": "Will you not cease to lend an ear to those orators of mysticism who tell you to pray and to wait, preaching salvation now through religion, now through power, and whose vehement and sonorous words captivate you?",
  "9642": "Monk?",
  "9643": "Can you be more kind in your daily life?",
  "9644": "Why should I hazard what I have?",
  "9645": "Did you see my daughter?",
  "9646": "The soldiers' baseness, or the general's fault?",
  "9647": "Whither?",
  "9648": "You see?",
  "9649": "Did you read yesterday's telegrams?",
  "9650": "What does he want with me?",
  "9651": "And you stood and looked on?",
  "9652": "Is there anything you would like?",
  "9653": "News?",
  "9654": "And how many have you in charge?",
  "9655": "I say, what's the matter with you?",
  "9656": "And, to avoid censure, what sacrifices are not made by weak minds?",
  "9657": "Well, what am I to do?",
  "9658": "Where is the money?",
  "9659": "Have you brought your wife?",
  "9660": "Vain?",
  "9661": "What shadows the brooks?",
  "9662": "Like husbandry for the acquisition of corn?",
  "9663": "Has he some secret sorrow that I cannot share?",
  "9664": "What have we shown so far?",
  "9665": "What had occasioned this precipitate departure?",
  "9666": "What made you go at all?",
  "9667": "She lets you off?",
  "9668": "And to what can it so naturally change as to affections or emotions, which are suitable to the temper, and agree with that set of passions, which then prevail?",
  "9669": "Well, did you like their horses?",
  "9670": "Do you know to whom you speak?",
  "9671": "Why is she not out with her brother?",
  "9672": "You have your liberty?",
  "9673": "But are we floating?",
  "9674": "How disentangle the passion for equality from the passion of cupidity, when begins the fight for equality of possessions?",
  "9675": "Do you know what time he will be home?",
  "9676": "A human skull?",
  "9677": "From that time forth, was it chance?",
  "9678": "And does why this seductive planet, more poetic than the sun, that seems destined, so discreet is it, to illuminate things too delicate and mysterious for the light of day, make the darkness so transparent?",
  "9679": "Are you serious, mother?",
  "9680": "What will you say to him now?",
  "9681": "What did she call me?",
  "9682": "What's the use of recalling what's past?",
  "9683": "How does he stand?",
  "9684": "Have you any objection to meet any persons who may be with madame, or do you desire to preserve a strict incognito?",
  "9685": "Or is it given to him?",
  "9686": "What other reason could he have?",
  "9687": "What about him?",
  "9688": "Oh, you're there, are you?",
  "9689": "Have you been ill?",
  "9690": "And surely you have known a city ere now that has marshalled her battalions against a rival state, but with defeat she changes suddenly and is willing to obey and not resist?",
  "9691": "For heaven's sake, where is that?",
  "9692": "How did you leave the count?",
  "9693": "And what did she answer, madame?",
  "9694": "Should we not do better in the grottos?",
  "9695": "What is the matter now, my bold equestrian?",
  "9696": "What will my husband say?",
  "9697": "How can there be?",
  "9698": "Up the river?",
  "9699": "From whom may the letter be you bear to his eminence?",
  "9700": "More than ten pounds?",
  "9701": "To what extent, at this time, was she really a victim?",
  "9702": "What is he here for?",
  "9703": "Lachenel?",
  "9704": "Have you not seen him?",
  "9705": "And so you pick me up in your round, eh?",
  "9706": "What should I be afraid of?",
  "9707": "Where, where, he asked himself, was it all to end?",
  "9708": "Do you not see that you are sliding down a declivity, and that you are obliged to grasp at something similar to the existing law?",
  "9709": "Did she go last night?",
  "9710": "What CAN be done about her?",
  "9711": "Is there anything else you want, good man?",
  "9712": "What view do you take of it?",
  "9713": "And what is knowledge, and among whom is it found?",
  "9714": "Half a crown?",
  "9715": "Did this arise from scorn or from respect?",
  "9716": "Would you mind giving me a little something?",
  "9717": "Who is our friend, my dear friend?",
  "9718": "What does he do that for?",
  "9719": "For what time shall I order dinner?",
  "9720": "Yes, but beer?",
  "9721": "You remember, miss, that we passed some conversation on a certain man this morning?",
  "9722": "What was that?",
  "9723": "Why have you stayed away so long?",
  "9724": "Under her direct appeal for the truth?",
  "9725": "Did you hit your man?",
  "9726": "Is it not time to awake from the deceitful dream of a golden age, and to adopt as a practical maxim for the direction of our political conduct that we, as well as the other inhabitants of the globe, are yet remote from the happy empire of perfect wisdom and perfect virtue?",
  "9727": "Says his father is buried there, eh?",
  "9728": "She has had what she wanted from the house?",
  "9729": "It is a conspiracy, then?",
  "9730": "You would not have recognized me?",
  "9731": "What conclusion do you draw from it?",
  "9732": "Is there a little boy here?",
  "9733": "How could we know when you would return?",
  "9734": "But what further do they couple with these demands which they make for congressional legislation?",
  "9735": "Has he been drinking?",
  "9736": "Did you see what he went after?",
  "9737": "Shillings perhaps?",
  "9738": "How did it begin?",
  "9739": "Did you quarrel with him?",
  "9740": "And you loved her?",
  "9741": "Where are you going so fast?",
  "9742": "What do you think better?",
  "9743": "What availed him then his strength and his prowess?",
  "9744": "But surely he has been destroyed?",
  "9745": "Does the gentleman always have books like that under his arm?",
  "9746": "Was he seen to come out?",
  "9747": "Is your excellency really in earnest?",
  "9748": "And what did she say to that?",
  "9749": "To whom can I speak it now?",
  "9750": "Who owes it you?",
  "9751": "What will the poor authors do in the presence of this omnipotent union of booksellers?",
  "9752": "But you said when we were getting up this morning that you had something you wished to tell me before I left?",
  "9753": "Did you fancy yourself dying?",
  "9754": "Aramis become your surety?",
  "9755": "Does he say so?",
  "9756": "What do you think will happen?",
  "9757": "What impression has my evidence made upon you?",
  "9758": "At what time will it be ready?",
  "9759": "And how do you come to be in our province?",
  "9760": "Where is that friend or enemy now?",
  "9761": "Do you support him for that purpose?",
  "9762": "Will you wait till you love no longer?",
  "9763": "How could I bring him?",
  "9764": "Are you all right?",
  "9765": "What new trouble has come?",
  "9766": "Peekish!?",
  "9767": "Would you wish a little more hot water, ma'am, or is there anything else that I could fetch you?",

  "9770": "What are your rates?",
  "9771": "But when?",
  "9772": "What have we seen in our own personal walks through life to make us believe that women are devils?",
  "9773": "Is that mere guesswork?",
  "9774": "Who then is YOUR neighbour?",
  "9775": "But my horse, madame?",
  "9776": "Did you happen to meet any soldiers, my dear, as you came through the wood?",
  "9777": "Has he been wounded, then?",
  "9778": "D'you mean to say that you could take me back after all that's happened?",
  "9779": "Whatever is this?",
  "9780": "And begging your pardon, mister, what name will we call you, for we'd like to know?",
  "9781": "Do not they know where the shoe pinches?",
  "9782": "But will he listen to me?",
  "9783": "What did you RECKON he wanted with it?",
  "9784": "But your own vessel, monsieur?",
  "9785": "Do you think he is old?",
  "9786": "And it's going on?",
  "9787": "Now spose you make me an offer?",
  "9788": "How can the continued overflowings of a susceptible heart suffer it to be incessantly employed in so many little cares relative to the person?",
  "9789": "Vholes?",
  "9790": "There has not been any change made about your own arrangements?",
  "9791": "Do you question it, when you will make me proud and happy above all others of your court?",
  "9792": "Was that lure of men even now in the house, completing her evil work?",
  "9793": "Can he be right?",
  "9794": "What was he like?",
  "9795": "What was the subject, madam?",
  "9796": "But are our missionaries capable?",
  "9797": "Where does he eat?",
  "9798": "What right have you to ask?",
  "9799": "Who was this new, radiant being who had won to existence out of the mist and darkness of our fears?",
  "9800": "I wonder where that ship comes from?",
  "9801": "What gentleman is this?",
  "9802": "Just lend me your scarf, will you?",
  "9803": "But what can they intend to do with the poor creature, and how shall I ever meet her again?",
  "9804": "Says the coroner, is that boy here?",
  "9805": "No kidding?",
  "9806": "Will yo tak' a message to him?",
  "9807": "If there be no life, the same as the animal's life in the vegetables, how could animals sustain their lives feeding on vegetables?",
  "9808": "Do you think there will be?",
  "9809": "But you've had enough now?",
  "9810": "Things fo' me?",
  "9811": "And you would wish me to advance some money?",
  "9812": "Now what is there in her?",
  "9813": "Does it follow that the preferences of love and friendship are unjust?",
  "9814": "But then, where could it be?",
  "9815": "Oh, you mean a change?",
  "9816": "Did you see a man in the pit?",
  "9817": "Do you think they'll object?",
  "9818": "Then there is nothing impossible or out of the order of nature in our finding a guardian who has a similar combination of qualities?",
  "9819": "Will you come back to me?",
  "9820": "And I think a glass of wine will not be disagreeable to you?",
  "9821": "What's that, a dog?",
  "9822": "How did you know I was in service?",
  "9823": "So you can stay here and trifle around with some one else?",
  "9824": "What could I do with myself?",
  "9825": "Then the just is like the wise and good, and the unjust like the evil and ignorant?",
  "9826": "Who can he be?",
  "9827": "And the silver?",
  "9828": "How can we possibly be anything else?",
  "9829": "You have a theory?",
  "9830": "Will not the post be better?",
  "9831": "And do you think now that she could undertake a voyage of some extent?",
  "9832": "Do you suppose I should contend against the most valiant sword in the kingdom?",
  "9833": "A lesson?",
  "9834": "How can he be used as a guide to a blind man, who does not support him when tottering, nor raise him up when fallen?",

  "9845": "But would he?",
  "9846": "What makes you think it 'ud be against his will?",
  "9847": "For heaven's sake what have you done?",
  "9848": "Who, after such brilliant examples of our annihilating justice, who dare accuse us of forbearance?",
  "9849": "How explain, how find out her wishes?",
  "9850": "What then remained for me to do?",
  "9851": "You refer to the possible hindrances from want of health?",
  "9852": "What other hardier pioneer would come, hatchet in hand, to cut down the dark copses?",
  "9853": "Ever been kicked?",
  "9854": "Well, how do YOU explain it?",
  "9855": "And to what penalty do you think the king will be condemned?",
  "9856": "Why was my heart so faint?",
  "9857": "How has that contest gone?",
  "9858": "Then you did not see either of them?",
  "9859": "Then why are you leaving?",
  "9860": "On what occasion would it be most probable that such a presentation would be made?",
  "9861": "Il est mort?",

  "9863": "Perhaps you have some special information?",
  "9864": "Then how in the name of all that is wonderful did you get these facts?",
  "9865": "And is not this enough to prove that the establishment of equal toleration was not his plan?",
  "9866": "What is the sun?",
  "9867": "Had he a hat?",
  "9868": "After all, the question is still where?",
  "9869": "Did he not tell you?",

  "9925": "Why is she wandering alone through these mountains?",
  "9926": "If we reject it now, is there any human probability that we shall ever see again so propitious a set of circumstances to bring about the same results?",
  "9927": "Was it indeed a house of death to which I had come, too late?",
  "9928": "Where is that?",
  "9929": "And those who govern ought not to be lovers of the task?",

  "9944": "Well, what should I say to the king?",
  "9945": "Is there immediate danger?",
  "9946": "Eyes of an admirable expression?",

  "10348": "Ah, indeed?",
  "10349": "Because you are sorry to leave it?",
  "10350": "Shall we get into that boat, then, and push off?",
  "10351": "Madame, what shall I do with this linen fine?",
  "10352": "The whole of it?",
  "10353": "Even under this disguise?",
  "10354": "That I should plead their seuerall actions?",
  "10355": "Then you will appear?",
  "10356": "You never do anything at all to please me, do you, dear?",
  "10357": "Do you play?",
  "10358": "Not married after all?",
  "10359": "Whose but his own?",
  "10360": "You have formed a conclusion?",
  "10361": "Is not the exact opposite the truth?",
  "10362": "The other world?",
  "10363": "But where?",
  "10364": "Shall I call him by his name?",
  "10365": "How did you obtain these details?",
  "10366": "Do you live there?",
  "10367": "Hauskuld tells who he is, and asked what guests might be there in the house?",
  "10368": "Was it really true that all were dead?",
  "10369": "Why should he have taken to his heels?",
  "10370": "What more?",
  "10371": "But if it amused my father?",
  "10372": "And how long does it subsist?",
  "10373": "Then you are not in the habit of bolting your door every night before you get into bed?",
  "10374": "Will they forge you the sword of your deliverance, will they marshal you the army and lead it to the fray?",
  "10375": "If so, that alone would hardly alter the matter, for what could she give in return?",
  "10376": "To leave you?",
  "10377": "Have you had a good journey?",
  "10378": "When was it ever otherwise?",
  "10379": "Do you know the impression your words give me?",
  "10380": "Is it, indeed, sir?",
  "10381": "Can you be ignorant that the council always act with moderation and respect towards ambassadors, but that the people are full of ambition and great designs?",
  "10382": "Do you wish me to tell you what to do with it?",
  "10383": "Why, sir?",
  "10384": "Have the suitors returned, or are they still waiting over yonder, to take me on my way home?",
  "10385": "Why should it not roll onwards, like the moon, a dark cold mass in space?",
  "10386": "Is it proper for men to say it and not for women?",
  "10387": "D'you want to go to bed already?",
  "10388": "And what is it that he wants?",
  "10389": "What are you afraid of?",
  "10390": "You are in a great hurry, then?",
  "10391": "What more can I tell you, dear?",
  "10392": "The relation between you and me, PAR EXEMPLE?",
  "10393": "How can we?",
  "10394": "Do you mind, dear?",
  "10395": "But he never brought light into anything quite so dark as this?",
  "10396": "But WHAT is worse?",
  "10397": "What time is it?",
  "10398": "Is it only the guilty whose honor is at the sport of others, sir?",
  "10399": "Do you know the best of gettin' ashore again?",
  "10400": "And what do you think he was doing?",
  "10401": "What's one to do, my dear?",
  "10402": "And what shall I wear?",
  "10403": "What was she like?",
  "10404": "Why, there is not a function of a single organ in the body which has not been determined wholly and solely by experiment?",
  "10405": "You were just looking for an opportunity to throw me over and you took that one?",
  "10406": "The big house near the sea, you mean?",
  "10407": "Is it not the idea which is developed through it, the emotion with which it vibrates, which expands, elevates and ennobles it?",
  "10408": "All over?",
  "10409": "Is he going to die?",
  "10410": "My foundation laid on earth for a mansion in heaven?",
  "10411": "Shall one raging hand thus level all?",
  "10412": "What shall you do with him?",
  "10413": "Gluttony?",
  "10414": "What the deuce is the matter with him?",
  "10415": "Why should any one want to ask such questions, after an address like that?",
  "10416": "Is the authority of man over man just?",
  "10417": "Is he religious?",
  "10418": "How much could I lose if things went wrong?",
  "10419": "On the west coast?",
  "10420": "What good do they do us?",
  "10421": "Where is reason?",
  "10422": "And what does it matter, now you're here to protect me?",
  "10423": "Who has occupied it the night before?",
  "10424": "Ten o'clock at night?",
  "10425": "The bottle must go somewhere, and why not here as well as anywhere else?",
  "10426": "Then the lover of wisdom has a great advantage over the lover of gain, for he has a double experience?",
  "10427": "What then, and how come you here?",
  "10428": "But where is the misfortune in this?",
  "10429": "See us looking, now, at you?",
  "10430": "What remedy can there be for this situation, but in a change of the system which has produced it in a change of the fallacious and delusive system of quotas and requisitions?",
  "10431": "Was it this that made her ill?",
  "10432": "Excuse me, prince, but what are your arrangements?",
  "10433": "Do not whole scales of colors invisibly exist above and below the limits of our retinal sensibility?",
  "10434": "Have you ever had a difference with a dear friend?",
  "10435": "You came upon a private quarrel?",
  "10436": "What, if the idea should come to him in his madness that it would be well for him to slay his wife and his children?",
  "10437": "Oh, fie, now shall I just tell you why you came here today?",
  "10438": "To whom is it degrading?",
  "10439": "Where are you lodging, monsieur?",
  "10440": "But did your reverence hear of the portent that was seen last night?",
  "10441": "What do you say to that show of sense?",
  "10442": "Do you accept the commission which I have intrusted to you?",
  "10443": "Have I forgotten myself so far that I have not even told you his name?",
  "10444": "What was to be done after the crowning of the king?",
  "10445": "Have you not got enough corn of your own?",
  "10446": "We might ask, why it should be a greater proof of insanity in men to set a high value on rare tulips than on rare stones, which are neither more useful nor more beautiful?",
  "10447": "Is it your pleasure, most dear father, that you speak?",
  "10448": "And what will you do about it?",
  "10449": "The girl's name?",
  "10450": "And what have they promised?",
  "10451": "Mole?",
  "10452": "Did it do you any good?",
  "10453": "Which of your firm was it who called on me this morning?",
  "10454": "Can you get out?",
  "10455": "Have I to do with men of straw?",
  "10456": "Where was the monk going?",
  "10457": "Did we come up or down stream?",
  "10458": "The cave?",
  "10459": "Now should they undertake it immediately, and devote this day to it?",
  "10460": "Did the woman keep her oath?",
  "10461": "Why do you do this?",
  "10462": "But who can tell you the real truth of the matter?",
  "10463": "What solution will result later from these data?",
  "10464": "Then you were not merely jesting?",
  "10465": "How many and what dispositions were wanting to make 'em wise?",
  "10466": "But how had she learned?",
  "10467": "For their ransom?",
  "10468": "What else, sir?",
  "10469": "Is it entirely true that the vote has necessarily and really these inherent magical powers of rapid education for individuals and for classes of men, fitting them, in default of other qualifications, for the high responsibilities of suffrage?",
  "10470": "How, in short, reconcile what the progress already accomplished has had the effect of rendering irreconcilable?",
  "10471": "Is it a wreck?",
  "10472": "How much for?",
  "10473": "Your secretary?",
  "10474": "What in the world SHOULD it be?",
  "10475": "Then why inflict it on yourself?",
  "10476": "Shall I not have back the equivalent of his robbery?",
  "10477": "Where was it found?",
  "10478": "What did he give you for thus serving him?",
  "10479": "Is it possible that she has recognised me?",
  "10480": "Are you the boy whom I saw playing in the stacks last week?",
  "10481": "Shall I show you his apartments?",
  "10482": "Why do you make those grimaces, man?",
  "10483": "The meaning, monsieur?",
  "10484": "You really advise it?",
  "10485": "Then we will let it take its chance?",
  "10486": "You are aware it will be war, civil war, furious, devouring, implacable?",
  "10487": "What respect then can be paid to that which describes nothing, and which means nothing?",
  "10488": "And then what?",
  "10489": "What happeneth unto me?",
  "10490": "But, oh, is he on land or sea?",
  "10491": "And what are you doing with it?",
  "10492": "Fletcher?",
  "10493": "What COULD I do?",
  "10494": "How do you know it's not that?",
  "10495": "Is it large?",
  "10496": "Is this all your family, ma'am?",
  "10497": "Have you indeed decided?",
  "10498": "What are we to do with her?",
  "10499": "It seems then he bears a very changing sail?",
  "10500": "I say, have you got your mules ready?",
  "10501": "What does scandal signify to me?",
  "10502": "D'you know what sort of a practice this is?",
  "10503": "Ah, who, who?",
  "10504": "And therefore has neither more nor less of discord, nor yet of harmony?",
  "10505": "Let you be going down the markets, and what would you see for sale?",
  "10506": "And she had the right to live in your house and use your things?",
  "10507": "Pray where are their hens?",
  "10508": "Now, that is what he said, or to that purpose, was it not?",
  "10509": "What do you want with him?",
  "10510": "Or what usually happens, in case any one refuses payment of this tribute?",
  "10511": "What doth it profit a man to gain the whole world if he suffer the loss of his immortal soul?",
  "10512": "Her singing was less remarkable?",
  "10513": "Drunk?",
  "10514": "Are you pleased with what you have heard?",
  "10515": "Do you lock yourself up from me, to make my search more curious?",
  "10516": "Now, did the dogs act thus from the experience of each individual, or from the example of the older and wiser dogs, or from an inherited habit, that is from instinct?",
  "10517": "And a choice of what?",
  "10518": "Are you all right here?",
  "10519": "But what were these fatigues, what did the wounds matter?",
  "10520": "My business?",
  "10521": "What else do you hear?",
  "10522": "Not worth speaking of?",
  "10523": "Would the boat, however, resist more shocks of this kind?",
  "10524": "You will not fail me at the next term with the rest?",
  "10525": "He brings his right arm up, jist across his face, and passes on, with a knowin nod of his head, as much as to say, how do you do?",
  "10526": "Why are the birds all perching together over there?",
  "10527": "Do you wish to have an idea of their appearance?",
  "10528": "What is it for you?",
  "10529": "Of course you know that ambition and avarice are held to be, as indeed they are, a disgrace?",
  "10530": "What does a man learn by travelling?",
  "10531": "Then what is it for?",
  "10532": "As to the autonomy of the village communities, what could be retained of it after so many blows?",
  "10533": "A fear of what?",
  "10534": "You know that there is another man then?",
  "10535": "Is she still in town?",
  "10536": "Do you think that I would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death?",
  "10537": "When will he come back?",
  "10538": "How should she know his parts?",
  "10539": "And you were saying, sire?",
  "10540": "But you, my dear d'Artagnan?",
  "10541": "Have you got your thick boots on, and something warm under your cloak?",
  "10542": "How could we bid them hither?",
  "10543": "Well, how about your case?",
  "10544": "Speak how?",
  "10545": "And is not life to be reckoned among the ends of the soul?",
  "10546": "Why, who the devil should there be?",
  "10547": "Who slammed the door?",
  "10548": "What does all this mean?",
  "10549": "What is the good of such rules?",
  "10550": "Or had you rather forfeit your kingdom, your treasures, and your life?",
  "10551": "How are you going to manage that, captain?",
  "10552": "Did she stand the journey well?",
  "10553": "What's it to be?",
  "10554": "What business had she to go away?",
  "10555": "Why poor?",
  "10556": "But it had not approached the body?",
  "10557": "Where did you place it?",
  "10558": "Before the trial?",
  "10559": "My lord, you loue her?",
  "10560": "And what would you do in return?",
  "10561": "Ah, but madame, does mankind ever lose anything?",
  "10562": "Not heard of him, perhaps?",
  "10563": "Why do you come here to do this?",
  "10564": "The king's room?",
  "10565": "Am I a servant?",
  "10566": "Where's the clothes you run off in, you ungrateful robber?",
  "10567": "What do we do next?",
  "10568": "Had this mysterious being, whatever he was, whose existence could not be denied, abandoned the island?",
  "10569": "What will become of me then?",
  "10570": "He has confessed it to you yourself?",
  "10571": "What has the wretch been doing to him?",
  "10572": "To me?",
  "10573": "Then I hope your finger is better now?",
  "10574": "What was the sound?",
  "10575": "Is equality coming, or inequality going?",
  "10576": "Is there no such thing as a gentleman?",
  "10577": "What is your name, boy?",
  "10578": "But, sir, are you sure he is as guilty as they say?",
  "10579": "From where does she hail?",
  "10580": "Further, I said, has not a drunken man also the spirit of a tyrant?",
  "10581": "Why do you, a stranger coming into my rooms at this time of the night, ask that question?",
  "10582": "What did they want from him?",
  "10583": "Who shall still appoint what shall be discoursed, what presumed, and no further?",
  "10584": "How do you know it?",
  "10585": "And you believe her promise?",
  "10586": "Who?",
  "10587": "Tell me, now, if persistence is not a virtue?",
  "10588": "What, it may be asked, is the true spirit of the institution itself?",
  "10589": "Is this a theatre?",
  "10590": "You set me at defiance, do you?",
  "10591": "Does his crew drink air?",
  "10592": "Is not this your opinion, gentlemen?",
  "10593": "Did you notice that sort of flash or flicker the candle gave before it was extinguished?",
  "10594": "On our account?",
  "10595": "Have you studied the habits of hens?",
  "10596": "Is that the sun I see shining, my friend?",
  "10597": "How is it you do?",
  "10598": "Could it be possible that the place was peculiarly unpropitious to her comfort?",
  "10599": "Can they be coming at me?",
  "10600": "Snow at this time?",
  "10601": "What, can he steal, that you demand so much?",
  "10602": "If it was so, was she not bound to show her this letter?",
  "10603": "Suppose we all go away?",
  "10604": "And what is the engagement?",
  "10605": "At what point does deception blossom out into the unmistakable lie?",
  "10606": "Do you want any music?",
  "10607": "A ewe's a small thing, but what would you give me if I did wed him and did save you so?",
  "10608": "You pretend to be ignorant?",
  "10609": "Would you like to read a letter I had from him this morning?",
  "10610": "Did you get very wet?",
  "10611": "Did she see him often?",
  "10612": "Do you particularly like the man?",
  "10613": "Look?",
  "10614": "Is he asleep?",
  "10615": "And if each is one, and both are two, she will conceive the two as in a state of division, for if there were undivided they could only be conceived of as one?",
  "10616": "What could they do, did she think?",
  "10617": "Can I help you now?",
  "10618": "How do they live?",
  "10619": "This beast, I rather conclude, friend, is not of home raising, but is from foreign lands, or perhaps from the little island itself over the blue water?",
  "10620": "Do they hop?",
  "10621": "What's wrong with me?",
  "10622": "Would it not then have been the same if he had died of a fever or of the small pox, of old age, or of anything else?",
  "10623": "In order not to involve the social wealth in an unlimited and consequently disastrous solidarity, will they content themselves with imposing rules upon the spirit of invention and enterprise?",
  "10624": "Is not that a perfect and lofty love?",
  "10625": "But was she here when the lady came?",
  "10626": "Do I talk nonsense if I wish to recover my money?",
  "10627": "Are these plains composed of arid sand, as the first astronomer maintained?",
  "10628": "Alive and well?",
  "10629": "You have some plan, then?",
  "10630": "How could he answer to such an appeal?",
  "10631": "Do you think the poison he fell a victim to was intended for him?",
  "10632": "Shall we get on with our work?",
  "10633": "Mean to say he knowed nothing of you?",
  "10634": "Have you lost your wits?",
  "10635": "What wreck?",
  "10636": "Would you be good enough to turn your face to the window?",
  "10637": "And why had I these aspirations and these regrets?",
  "10638": "So you have a lodging?",
  "10639": "Go away with you?",
  "10640": "This is not your writing?",
  "10641": "For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?",
  "10642": "Who told me to love her?",
  "10643": "And is that all you can say for him?",
  "10644": "Do you think it would be worth a week's wages?",
  "10645": "When is the time?",
  "10646": "What is this, my dear?",
  "10647": "What if I were to try such and such a thing?",
  "10648": "Do you think the countess would mind my having or two of them here if I were to ask her?",
  "10649": "How can she conceal the intrigue from other people's eyes?",
  "10650": "And the persons whose property is taken from them are compelled to defend themselves before the people as they best can?",
  "10651": "Do they, when they put to flight, as it is said, disorders that have baffled the powers of medicine, work in conformity to the light of reason?",
  "10652": "Have you the keys to those two doors?",
  "10653": "You understand that, I hope?",
  "10654": "Who is happy?",
  "10655": "And, if natural, may it not be assumed to be proper and right?",
  "10656": "Who talks of dying?",
  "10657": "Can they be saved when the army has gone?",
  "10658": "Can it harm my lover for me to live on after he is dead, if I take no pleasure in anything but in the woe I bear for him?",
  "10659": "Will you only say that you have been mistaken, and that I may depend on your not acting secretly in future?",
  "10660": "Was it for this, however, that his visits to the farm formed a delightful exception to the meagre occupations of his life?",
  "10661": "An instance?",
  "10662": "But will you go with me to gain the pardons?",
  "10663": "Will you stand upon your legs, you young devil?",
  "10664": "Did she object to it?",
  "10665": "And if her ships are not to be admitted into our harbours, I would ask, how is she to protect us?",
  "10666": "May I hope it?",
  "10667": "Must you really go now?",
  "10668": "And the more detestable his actions are to the citizens the more satellites and the greater devotion in them will he require?",
  "10669": "I suppose it could be managed somehow?",
  "10670": "Have you made him any promise that I must ratify?",
  "10671": "Am I not interrupting your conversation?",
  "10672": "Have you no fears lest your conduct should be misinterpreted?",
  "10673": "The big cake or the little deadlies?",
  "10674": "Will you swear to sacrifice even your lives in their defense, and to keep them always by your valor in the path to victory?",
  "10675": "Anything moving in the old place, mid I ask?",
  "10676": "Are you going to leave me?",
  "10677": "Surely you are mistaken about his trade?",
  "10678": "Can this be it?",
  "10679": "Lemonade, sir?",
  "10680": "Have I not shown my power?",
  "10681": "And how can she do so if, up to this minute, by your own statement, she is herself in ignorance of your knowledge?",
  "10682": "What do we know of the beauty they replace?",
  "10683": "Am I still superintendent?",
  "10684": "Why, what is there so terrific in the cavern?",
  "10685": "Then where did papa get it?",
  "10686": "Then, it is your opinion that our friend has perished in the waves?",
  "10687": "Do you really forgive me?",
  "10688": "What do I say?",
  "10689": "Did I frighten you so much?",
  "10690": "Are you here before me?",
  "10691": "But ought we to attempt to construct one?",
  "10692": "And she knows nothing of it?",
  "10693": "Have you seen a ooser?",
  "10694": "How do you know that?",
  "10695": "What, are you ready there?",
  "10696": "What do you want with her, boy?",
  "10697": "You know the hunt and chase?",
  "10698": "You at last?",
  "10699": "On your word, now?",
  "10700": "But, it will be asked, what kind of a treasure is this that we propose to bequeath to posterity?",
  "10701": "How do you get at that?",
  "10702": "Frank?",
  "10703": "Are you strong enough?",
  "10704": "Now, I want to hear you swear that you are not married to that woman?",
  "10705": "But what, then, is the noise?",
  "10706": "How did you conceive that idea?",
  "10707": "Now, do it look like it?",
  "10708": "Where can they be?",
  "10709": "Was he considering what pallet, what brushes, what canvas he must use, to introduce them into visible life through his art?",
  "10710": "Can you spare me a very few minutes?",
  "10711": "Has the sly old fox made his fortune then, and gone to live in a tranquil cot in a pleasant spot with a distant view of the changing sea?",
  "10712": "What man would marry a girl so placed?",
  "10713": "To what end?",
  "10714": "Do you know?",
  "10715": "Or is it by the law courts and the judge?",
  "10716": "Whom had we to deal with?",
  "10717": "And yet there was one thing wanting in order to complete your happiness?",
  "10718": "I hope there's nothing wrong?",
  "10719": "Have the private emotions also their gutter press?",
  "10720": "Yes, but how came you here again?",
  "10721": "Do you think there is a single person in the county who will not know that his doing is a sign that he has quarrelled with me?",
  "10722": "Are your doubts on that point too strong?",
  "10723": "Who you gwine to take to jail now?",
  "10724": "You, my lord?",
  "10725": "But who could help loving her?",
  "10726": "How so, if he love her?",

  "12689": "Again, is it not the agriculturist who fattens, for our clothes, his abundant flocks in the pastures?",
  "12690": "Why should one live?",
  "12691": "Do you see those four windows?",
  "12692": "Would he not at once have freed them?",
  "12693": "The question is, what did the archbishop find?",
  "12694": "In case of disaster, would not a retreat be more difficult by your plan than mine?",
  "12695": "Why did the conductor run along the footboard, why are they shrieking, those young men in that train?",
  "12696": "You did attempt it?",
  "12697": "Love you?",
  "12698": "Who?",
  "12699": "How do they drink?",
  "12700": "Why fear for me?",
  "12701": "You are, of course, the person who has written me so many letters?",
  "12702": "What of me?",
  "12703": "What then?",
  "12704": "And what did they take?",
  "12705": "Will you leave me alone?",
  "12706": "Is your carriage here?",
  "12707": "But what has he ever done that he should be dean?",
  "12708": "Who was to tell us what had happened then?",
  "12709": "Do you follow all this?",
  "12710": "Can there be any other opinion on the subject?",
  "12711": "You grant that?",
  "12712": "Oh, my lungs and liver, what do you want?",
  "12713": "But is the analogy a real one?",
  "12714": "Have I any need to tell you so?",
  "12715": "Now he is gone, are you come to see how unhappy I am?",
  "12716": "What do they do to him?",
  "12717": "Nothing to add?",
  "12718": "How dare you pry, and peer, and stare at me, sirrah?",
  "12719": "Who can have given earth the wisdom and power to produce corn?",
  "12720": "And have you been good to him?",
  "12721": "What still remains to be thrown out?",
  "12722": "Curiosity?",
  "12723": "Had I known how could I have given them to him?",
  "12724": "And you have done nothing in favor of our love?",
  "12725": "What, again, is the meaning of light and heavy, if that which is light is also heavy, and that which is heavy, light?",
  "12726": "What on earth are you crying for now?",
  "12727": "Then why does that chattering magpie tell such lies to a woman?",
  "12728": "But you yourself were the person who suggested that?",
  "12729": "Perhaps you can account also for the bullet which has so obviously struck the edge of the window?",
  "12730": "But you will after a while, and then what will become of me?",
  "12731": "And where are my books?",
  "12732": "Could we better?",
  "12733": "What's come to you?",
  "12734": "If you were mad, do you think I should hate you?",
  "12735": "Do you know where he proposes to go?",
  "12736": "But what chance is there of success?",
  "12737": "Of what did these lovers talk then?",
  "12738": "Well, what?",
  "12739": "And how is our patient?",
  "12740": "Was there any chance of escaping from the fury of this impetuous torrent, and of returning to the surface of the globe?",
  "12741": "Then what have you to say of me?",
  "12742": "What, still keeping up this silly jest?",
  "12743": "Shall we take our valets?",
  "12744": "Let us discuss it like honest people, like friends, and then forget what has passed between us, shall we?",
  "12745": "And where have you just come from?",
  "12746": "And why has she, or any other, curled hair?",
  "12747": "Imogen was true, but now was she rewarded?",
  "12748": "You follow my reasoning, do you not?",
  "12749": "But he is quiet to ride?",
  "12750": "How thrive you with this second wife of yours?",
  "12751": "Why has this been sent to my house?",
  "12752": "Would you like to kiss me?",
  "12753": "Would I find out that boy that had fed him and kep his secret, and give him them two one pound notes?",
  "12754": "What atmospheric disturbance was the cause of them?",
  "12755": "Astonish us?",
  "12756": "What's property?",
  "12757": "Besides, what good has it ever done when I have set my face against them?",
  "12758": "Have you a light?",
  "12759": "And what meaning is that in their solemn depth?",
  "12760": "Why do you stand gaping there?",
  "12761": "Was it a wire or a mathematical line?",
  "12762": "Where are you off to so early?",
  "12763": "Are you going far in this condition?",
  "12764": "From hence how far?",
  "12765": "It's a possible thing?",
  "12766": "What is it a sign of when your shade's like a coffin, neighbours?",
  "12767": "Would any single measure be so effective in removing all plausible grounds for these intrusions as the graduation of price already suggested?",
  "12768": "And do you reflect that guilt upon me which should lie buried in your bosom?",
  "12769": "Would you also regret having me for your cousin?",
  "12770": "Would you like to become rich, or at least independent?",
  "12771": "Not the moon?",
  "12772": "Like a drink?",
  "12773": "When did you see him?",
  "12774": "And now let us see, young man, with your hand upon your conscience, how did all this come to pass?",
  "12775": "What sort of an actress was she?",
  "12776": "Of prosperity?",
  "12777": "Do parents bring children into the world for THOT?",
  "12778": "When have we had any quarrels over these things?",
  "12779": "And how did you find things there?",
  "12780": "The lock of the door being in a disabled condition, she then applied herself to securing it with the chain, which was not in good action either, and said would we go upstairs?",
  "12781": "You said he was alive?",
  "12782": "Well, if you knowed where he was, what did you ask me for?",
  "12783": "Well, are you moving soon?",
  "12784": "Brass's clerk, eh?",
  "12785": "Do you cut your pages with it, or what?",
  "12786": "And are you too great an enchanter ever to feel human suffering?",
  "12787": "My remark is not then original?",
  "12788": "But where is he taking us to?",
  "12789": "And you will stay with me?",
  "12790": "Was it from the interior of the earth?",
  "12791": "Where is the mystery in all this?",
  "12792": "They have refused?",
  "12793": "What were they?",
  "12794": "And she let you go again?",
  "12795": "Not come after all I've said?",
  "12796": "May we rely upon your consent?",
  "12797": "Is not this a clear sign of my ruin?",
  "12798": "Did he at all know where he wanted to live?",
  "12799": "And the drawers?",
  "12800": "Was she speaking thus seriously?",
  "12801": "Do you think I am deceived as to the flagrant impropriety of my conduct?",
  "12802": "Byng?",
  "12803": "What should I fear when I must never die?",
  "12804": "Do you feel ill?",
  "12805": "Why should ye?",
  "12806": "Shall I take you there?",
  "12807": "If anyone happens to be coming up behind them, man or woman, do you imagine that they will put themselves half an inch out of their way?",
  "12808": "Do you remember the boy that died here?",
  "12809": "Are you really a cure?",
  "12810": "Shall you, thus armed with bladders vile, attack my title, eminence, and pomp sublime?",
  "12811": "How many children?",
  "12812": "You know me, do you?",
  "12813": "And does not motherhood mean a vaster nation of brave sons and of gentle daughters, who, in their turn, will give us sons and daughters of their own?",
  "12814": "Now where can we fly?",
  "12815": "Oh, are we going out by the mirror?",
  "12816": "I do not understand you?",
  "12817": "But would you call the painter a creator and maker?",
  "12818": "Why do you look so woebegone all of a sudden?",
  "12819": "What are you going to do yourself?",
  "12820": "Must a soldier, hardened by forty years of wounds and blood, give you this lesson, monsieur?",
  "12821": "How have you employed yourself in my absence?",
  "12822": "You never hearn on 't?",
  "12823": "Would real ladies have asked him to tea?",
  "12824": "Could she have been reached by his wife?",
  "12825": "How so, sir?",
  "12826": "How were they to explore new countries?",
  "12827": "Why is the curtain drawn over her?",
  "12828": "Nay, why do you not doat now, signior?",
  "12829": "Shall I repeat it?",
  "12830": "And what's today?",
  "12831": "How can you think of such a thing?",
  "12832": "Will you clamber up, and pluck it to show to papa?",
  "12833": "Why would they try to cure her with pills and powders?",
  "12834": "Whose beneficence was like his?",
  "12835": "Are you not in favor with the new king?",
  "12836": "What is it?",
  "12837": "There are nettles everywhere, but are not smooth, green grasses more common still?",

  "12839": "If there should be an army to be made use of as the engine of despotism, what need of the militia?",
  "12840": "Are there any gentry in it?",
  "12841": "To what?",

  "12849": "Why then should nature have visited our reason with restless aspirations after it, as if it were one of our weightiest concerns?",
  "12850": "Is it at all a treacherous case, do you think, or is it one of mere ordinary guilt?",
  "12851": "Why, then, do you trouble yourself about it?",
  "12852": "What are you hooroaring at?",
  "12853": "Why should I not have made up my mind?",
  "12854": "And, if we can make ready what we have, have we the means at hand to distribute it?",
  "12855": "Now if I tell you mine, will you serve me as well?",
  "12856": "How shall I be able to get there?",
  "12857": "Were we not four?",
  "12858": "Is it quite certain that this betters their condition?",
  "12859": "Do you know what part of the country you are in?",
  "12860": "Do you mean the fashion, or the side?",
  "12861": "Why do you say this young man is so rich?",
  "12862": "What on earth should you do that for?",
  "12863": "What should she feel?",
  "12864": "Have you entirely finished?",
  "12865": "What medicine, sir?",

  "12871": "What is the right of labor?",
  "12872": "Have you heard the news?",
  "12873": "But you are perhaps mistaken, and he whom you seek is not above there at all, but here below, and perchance quite close to you?",
  "12874": "Is it worth your while, after every force has failed you, to retreat under the shelter of argument and persuasion?",
  "12875": "Who dares to say the contrary?",
  "12876": "But when he was looking to the front what, or how many whats, could be staring at him from the back?",
  "12877": "And I might not go with him?",
  "12878": "Was it by the scrupulous and inflexible justice of all his undertakings, by the immense dangers and difficulties with which they were attended, or by the unwearied and unrelenting application with which he pursued them?",

  "12951": "What have you to propose?",
  "12952": "Is there not here a human world created by us, unforeseen and unknown to eternal fate, intelligible to our minds alone, a sensual and intellectual distraction, which has been invented solely by and for that discontented and restless little animal, man?",

  "14487": "If so, if she had been wrong to accede to that offer when made, would she not be doubly wrong to hold him to it now that she saw his error?",
  "14488": "Say?",
  "14489": "Do you understand this?",
  "14490": "Then you will come and dine with me?",

  "14493": "Why do you insult me by telling me all this?",
  "14494": "What woman?",
  "14495": "And do you think, my excellent friend, that a musician when he adjusts the lyre would desire or claim to exceed or go beyond a musician in the tightening and loosening the strings?",

  "14497": "What could have passed between the two, what ailed the man?",
  "14498": "And CONTIN?",
  "14499": "All well?",
  "14500": "A fine fellow, is he not?",
  "14501": "What is that, grandmother?",
  "14502": "How would he feel when he met her again, in her poor ruined home?",

  "14537": "Well, sir, is not a substitute clothed with all the power and dignity of him who grants the commission?",
  "14538": "Are we not, sir?",
  "14539": "How should the individual choose his satisfactions?",
  "14540": "And who has filled your head with all this nonsense?",

  "14548": "What shall be our excuse with the king?",
  "14549": "But is this really so?",
  "14550": "Have I called you down from the stars?",
  "14551": "For how much?",
  "14552": "But what do you want with me?",
  "14553": "Is not that quite enough?",
  "14554": "Say he need not lose his children and his wife, will he love you for that more than one who knows he well deserved the loss?",
  "14555": "Or had it transformed itself into this man, and what did the whole thing mean?",
  "14556": "Do you know anything of the commissionnaire?",
  "14557": "Through marriage?",
  "14558": "And do you impute it to either of those?",
  "14559": "Is she not perhaps still a married woman with a living husband?",
  "14560": "Is there never another to be found in the world?",
  "14561": "What's that, captain?",
  "14562": "Did you ever spend a quieter night in our little house at Königsberg?",

  "14564": "Have you enough till I come back?",
  "14565": "Are they better than gold pieces?",
  "14566": "Wel, what of him?",
  "14567": "Why all these complaints?",
  "14568": "If he does not boast of his deeds, who will?",
  "14569": "I am only asking you, is it worth it?",
  "14570": "Tom, have you anything to tell me?",
  "14571": "A gift?",
  "14572": "But, my dear, will you not give us a little hope of touching this heart, so kind and generous?",
  "14573": "Then why do you keep thinking about it?",
  "14574": "What's the use of talking?",
  "14575": "Has he?",
  "14576": "What say you then?",
  "14577": "Do you reflect that all those words will be branded in my memory, and eating deeper eternally after you have left me?",
  "14578": "What example?",
  "14579": "Do you know him personally?",
  "14580": "You cannot mean to shoot me?",
  "14581": "Why does he never write?",
  "14582": "If I go out of and beyond the conception A, in order to recognize another B as connected with it, what foundation have I to rest on, whereby to render the synthesis possible?",
  "14583": "Are they not a race contemptuous of others?",
  "14584": "Does it, in fine, consist in the greater obstacles opposed to the concert and accomplishment of the secret wishes of an unjust and interested majority?",
  "14585": "Why did she seem so abstracted?",
  "14586": "The pony?",
  "14587": "What men be ye?",
  "14588": "Who had done this?",
  "14589": "Are we, then, speeding forward to some cataract which will cast us down an abyss?",

  "14595": "Which one of you knows whether I have said it or no?",
  "14596": "Has she ever seen you before?",
  "14597": "What do they matter to us?",
  "14598": "Must I be subject to this merciless villain?",
  "14599": "Is your roaguery become an office, with a knaues name?",

  "15409": "Just look at me, am I not charming?",
  "15410": "But what was to be done afterward, when both means of defense failed at once?",
  "15411": "Do you want money?",
  "15412": "What does the whaler do when she meets another whaler in any sort of decent weather?",
  "15413": "But why should you dislike him?",
  "15414": "Keep him?",
  "15415": "See it done?",
  "15416": "Indeed, my own?",
  "15417": "Which is the usurer?",
  "15418": "And if he say yes?",
  "15419": "Was he giving up his pulpit to a stranger for any reason less cogent than one which made it absolutely imperative of him to be silent in that church which had so long been his own?",
  "15420": "So you are frightened?",
  "15421": "Was it on the stage that you found your most intense joys, your true happiness?",
  "15422": "And for whom?",
  "15423": "Is life worth the trouble of so many questions?",
  "15424": "Do you see what blue spots he has?",
  "15425": "Do you think I would tell you so or come to you like this, if it were not the case?",
  "15426": "But what is the object of the war?",
  "15427": "What can 'em do otherwise?",
  "15428": "What, can there not?",
  "15429": "Will you show the seeds to me?",
  "15430": "Is the inquiry made?",
  "15431": "His feelings?",
  "15432": "Whether a clear head, or a copious invention?",
  "15433": "If I do so, for the time, whose fault is that?",
  "15434": "Why, if they were bent on modernising, did they not modernise the shields?",
  "15435": "And, said he, did I not tell you so at first?",
  "15436": "What will he do for us?",
  "15437": "I think you remember that, your excellency?",
  "15438": "What do you think of the old ladies?",
  "15439": "She did not, I hope, offer to strike your face?",
  "15440": "D'you mean to say those are mine?",
  "15441": "What about some lunch?",
  "15442": "May I, should I, on occasion, sacrifice myself?",
  "15443": "Ye are ugly?",
  "15444": "Then they follow you?",
  "15445": "Are you intimate?",
  "15446": "You are going to see your nurse, I suppose?",
  "15447": "When he came before me smiling and expecting that I would be glad to see him and would welcome him, and when I would not look at him, was not that a mortal blow?",
  "15448": "Who said I was?",
  "15449": "Even if she be, what right have I to cut her horse's harness?",
  "15450": "Where does he now live?",
  "15451": "And whither away?",
  "15452": "How, then?",
  "15453": "Did he examine to see if there were any practicable outlet from his prison?",
  "15454": "Then why go into subjects, old chap, which as betwixt two sech must be for ever onnecessary?",
  "15455": "Death, am I not married?",
  "15456": "Can it give me back my children, or make me what I used to be?",
  "15457": "Is it serious?",
  "15458": "Is the CONSEQUENCE from this doctrine admissible?",
  "15459": "What will I more, and what more happy thing can I desire?",
  "15460": "What business had I to interfere with outsiders?",
  "15461": "I wonder when he'll arrive?",
  "15462": "Why do his ears look like that?",
  "15463": "Of reproach?",
  "15464": "What reason, it may be asked, is there for supposing in these cases that two individuals ever concur in reproduction?",
  "15465": "Got it?",
  "15466": "Do you know what I am thinking about?",
  "15467": "But what was it to be?",
  "15468": "What is he doing?",
  "15469": "What is your greatest fault?",
  "15470": "I wonder how the trains run?",
  "15471": "How shall those who practice election frauds recover that respect for the sanctity of the ballot which is the first condition and obligation of good citizenship?",
  "15472": "And ought I to fear death who have changed happiness into grief?",
  "15473": "And what in the world is the matter with you?",
  "15474": "By a succession of surprises, like that of which we were talking?",
  "15475": "What, exactly, does that mean?",
  "15476": "Is that the real reason of your pious alarms?",
  "15477": "And how long, then, did the madmen reign?",
  "15478": "What sort of place is this?",
  "15479": "And who scruples to call her lady, duchess, or countess?",
  "15480": "Did you hear what he left fall the other day when we were there?",
  "15481": "But did you ever behold any of them with your eyes?",
  "15482": "The fleet?",
  "15483": "Alas, sir, where should a man seek?",
  "15484": "Then, my dear child, what in the world is the matter?",
  "15485": "Are you crying about father?",
  "15486": "Why did you cry?",
  "15487": "And you would be pleased to have, instead of this terrace of twenty feet, an enclosure of two acres?",
  "15488": "Now, how would you feel, if they were married, and the brothers, coming here on one of those kind errands which bring them here so often, you had to break out to them the truth?",
  "15489": "Did they persist in the fatal vice which destroyed them?",
  "15490": "What's the start?",
  "15491": "Besides, what did I ask of you?",
  "15492": "Where is the objection?",
  "15493": "Ah, what?",
  "15494": "Why not be friends?",
  "15495": "A decent sort of man, I suppose?",
  "15496": "I wonder what it is going to be?",
  "15497": "Is that really so?",
  "15498": "Heavens, what do I see?",
  "15499": "How do I know?",
  "15500": "What's your business here?",
  "15501": "What makes a gentlewoman?",
  "15502": "Go there?",
  "15503": "Where shall I go?",
  "15504": "Is not that your opinion as well as mine, my son?",
  "15505": "And it is twenty leagues?",
  "15506": "We get nothing but the fun, do we?",
  "15507": "How should I be so foolish?",
  "15508": "Beatings?",
  "15509": "And will call upon me?",
  "15510": "Across the dinner table?",
  "15511": "Are you sure of what you say?",
  "15512": "Not even for fifteen years' wages?",
  "15513": "Brandy, do you think?",
  "15514": "You've read her letters, I suppose?",
  "15515": "Why did you promise her any?",
  "15516": "Is it their fault or mine?",
  "15517": "How is he?",
  "15518": "You sing, then?",
  "15519": "Are you right now?",
  "15520": "Whither are you going?",
  "15521": "And how will it end?",
  "15522": "In short, what character, or peculiar turn of understanding, is more excellent than another?",
  "15523": "What harm can come thereof?",
  "15524": "And what's going to happen?",
  "15525": "Why are you weeping then?",
  "15526": "Was either group walled in hopelessly by sheer ignorance?",
  "15527": "Have you ever had any experience?",
  "15528": "Is there anything illogical about the meaning?",
  "15529": "What happens then?",
  "15530": "Were they deceiving him?",
  "15531": "Have you?",
  "15532": "For what are these cries raised?",
  "15533": "Do you mean I'M your difficulty?",
  "15534": "But may I not say one word for myself?",
  "15535": "Shall we go out for a row on the river now?",
  "15536": "Moreover, could he trust to the worship of which he saw himself the object?",
  "15537": "What awfulness, in heaven's name, is there between them?",
  "15538": "Have you a handcart in the house?",
  "15539": "Is there no other child?",
  "15540": "What say you, lady?",
  "15541": "You mean to take your horse?",
  "15542": "And a man was with you?",
  "15543": "Can you hold on with one hand long enough to slip the loop of this rope over your shoulders?",
  "15544": "What are you stopping me for?",
  "15545": "Ah, cannot you read between the lines?",
  "15546": "What, therefore, is to be done now?",
  "15547": "How can you do it to me, boys?",
  "15548": "Shall we sling a bowline over the foot?",
  "15549": "Are we not to be friends?",
  "15550": "What would be its fruits?",
  "15551": "What shall you do with this poor fellow?",
  "15552": "Do you, while receiving benefits from me and resting under my shade, dare to describe me as useless, and unprofitable?",
  "15553": "Well, what do you think about it?",
  "15554": "What will become of us?",
  "15555": "What is in their kitchens?",
  "15556": "But for what?",
  "15557": "Driven to do it, were you?",
  "15558": "Are they the work of your hands?",
  "15559": "You are not an enemy of our holy faith?",
  "15560": "Did you get my message?",
  "15561": "But one can draw some hypotheses, I suppose?",
  "15562": "On the one hand, each laborer's task being short and easy, and the means for its successful accomplishment being equal in all cases, how could there be large and small producers?",
  "15563": "But in public who shall express the unseen adequately?",
  "15564": "Where did you stop?",
  "15565": "Tell me what this wretched war is for?",
  "15566": "Now, where has that nasty little beast gone to?",
  "15567": "Could we put off our wedding till a little later?",
  "15568": "What is that again?",
  "15569": "Is it my father?",
  "15570": "Who and what are they?",
  "15571": "You are not jealous?",
  "15572": "Because you think I must have so little?",
  "15573": "Art?",
  "15574": "And would you wish to see that poor creature's domestic hearth ruined and broken up?",
  "15575": "Cold?",
  "15576": "What do they want to argue for?",
  "15577": "What did he do to you?",
  "15578": "Who's that which snatched the meat from me?",
  "15579": "Nor anything at all, then, my lady?",
  "15580": "What was she?",
  "15581": "You will not be angry?",
  "15582": "Had he inherited it?",
  "15583": "Is there one who would not prefer free intercourse with her to high duties on all our products and manufactures which enter her ports or cross her frontiers?",
  "15584": "But what then must be done?",
  "15585": "How does it happen, then, that he is in your service?",
  "15586": "But what would be the use of my telling you of her lodgings and her journeyings?",
  "15587": "What do you need to cure you of all that?",
  "15588": "Oh, there's more?",
  "15589": "You have, doubtless, already guessed that I was preparing a surprise for you?",
  "15590": "How could I become cruel or vicious, when I had before my eyes only examples of mildness, and was surrounded by some of the best people in the world?",
  "15591": "Will you go in there with me and help get it out?",
  "15592": "Can sight adequately perceive them?",
  "15593": "Who is that 'Another' to whose greater good I ought not to prefer my own lesser good?",
  "15594": "Is it hard?",
  "15595": "Why is everybody pursuing me so furiously?",
  "15596": "How many of 'em do you intend to save?",
  "15597": "A client, then?",
  "15598": "Will you introduce me to her some time, if I call?",
  "15599": "And the dog?",
  "15600": "Did he call out because he landed in the water, do you think?",
  "15601": "What will you give me?",
  "15602": "Why do you not apply to them, if you stand in need of help?",
  "15603": "Have you the paper on you?",
  "15604": "You know about that?",
  "15605": "What use'll I be then?",
  "15606": "Can the inexhaustible have any right?",
  "15607": "And I put it as a question to those, who make a study of mankind, whether representation and election is not too great a power for one and the same body of men to possess?",
  "15608": "What have you been in with me for ages?",
  "15609": "And why was this blessed change?",
  "15610": "Or what amendment of your affairs will it bring you, if you do not now go out to meet them?",
  "15611": "And the general?",
  "15612": "Your three suits of apparel a year?",
  "15613": "What do you say, why not go after all?",
  "15614": "Unjust, say you, sister?",
  "15615": "And there you are, my partner, eh?",
  "15616": "Is that she, mamma?",
  "15617": "And you, count, have made this match?",
  "15618": "Have you the keys?",
  "15619": "What is to become of you?",
  "15620": "But have we great resources?",
  "15621": "Do you know who I am?",
  "15622": "Not even a reverend?",
  "15623": "I wonder if I've been changed in the night?",
  "15624": "Can you really then come if we start early?",
  "15625": "Do you wish to hear the name?",
  "15626": "Wickeder than usual?",
  "15627": "My dear fellow, what on earth is there in that?",
  "15628": "Love?",
  "15629": "Have I?",
  "15630": "What sort?",
  "15631": "How, sire?",
  "15632": "Can we describe in the same terms what is natural to man everywhere and always?",
  "15633": "The countess asked her if she found those words in the letter?",
  "15634": "Will you come?",
  "15635": "Who skinned you?",
  "15636": "Would you know why I'm thus, good people?",
  "15637": "But where, when, and how have they been arrested?",
  "15638": "And your duties here have drawn to an end, sir?",
  "15639": "How about him?",
  "15640": "But where are we to go?",
  "15641": "What limit would you propose?",
  "15642": "Any eggs?",
  "15643": "Why give rise to property, where there cannot possibly be any injury?",
  "15644": "Did I nurse you for this, that you should spare your blood on your father's enemies?",
  "15645": "But who resists it?",
  "15646": "You dance?",
  "15647": "Why then should you mind if men talk as you think they will?",
  "15648": "How, and when, and in what proportion shall aids of men and money be afforded?",
  "15649": "Tell me, sir, could you have the courage to do so?",
  "15650": "Oh, signora, how can you be so cruel?",
  "15651": "For who would believe my story?",
  "15652": "You'll be alone?",
  "15653": "But what CAN be done?",
  "15654": "Well, which shall go to left and which to right?",
  "15655": "May we not say that these desires spend, and that the others make money because they conduce to production?",
  "15656": "Why are you awake?",
  "15657": "How were they made?",
  "15658": "Do you really love me?",
  "15659": "You traverse the town and the streets in disguise?",
  "15660": "Do I bother you with talking about it?",
  "15661": "Who, then?",
  "15662": "Then, in general, those kinds of things which are in the service of the body have less of truth and essence than those which are in the service of the soul?",
  "15663": "But what is sovereignty?",
  "15664": "Now, what would you give him?",
  "15665": "Whaling not respectable?",
  "15666": "Too illiterate?",
  "15667": "Are you the same as we?",
  "15668": "What, have you made a passive bawd of me?",
  "15669": "Who's the man that says that we're all islands shouting lies to each other across seas of misunderstanding?",
  "15670": "Been under fire already?",
  "15671": "Who are they?",
  "15672": "But what is this I have heard about your intention of marrying her?",
  "15673": "How, indeed, shall I keep the crimson of my royal mantle always fresh and bright, unless I continually dye it anew in the blood of criminals?",
  "15674": "What has placed itself between us?",
  "15675": "How can one explain these physical sufferings and this morbid distress that were known for some time to his intimates alone?",
  "15676": "What sort of man is he?",
  "15677": "And you are sure that this is your husband's hand?",
  "15678": "Have I still a goal?",
  "15679": "Have they run?",
  "15680": "I think I am not mistaken?",
  "15681": "The facts are admitted?",
  "15682": "What do I care whether he is or not?",
  "15683": "Do you love him enough to wait till he can make a home for you, or will you keep yourself quite free for the present?",
  "15684": "Why do you trouble the man?",
  "15685": "Well, which is better?",
  "15686": "Will you come aboard?",
  "15687": "Is this possible?",
  "15688": "I ask myself, and I ask you, whether it is in our power, by any means, to avert the evil consequences that are only too likely to follow?",
  "15689": "May we say so, then?",
  "15690": "You are going away tomorrow?",
  "15691": "How are you all?",
  "15692": "And what brings you here, you jade?",
  "15693": "Could you pull a little stronger?",
  "15694": "About the dean?",
  "15695": "Do you think you've 'known' me?",
  "15696": "May I ask your name?",
  "15697": "But what's the use?",
  "15698": "Think I was going to stop on now I'm a gentleman of property?",
  "15699": "Why had she come out?",
  "15700": "For who would want to choose by rule?",
  "15701": "What do you say?",
  "15702": "After all, I'm not the first one to have a baby, am I?",
  "15703": "Not yet?",
  "15704": "Have you finished your repast, friend?",
  "15705": "But can we ever be in love with the former?",
  "15706": "Is it not strange compensation?",
  "15707": "Where did he go?",
  "15708": "For camping?",
  "15709": "Hall?",
  "15710": "Do you know what the result of that would be?",
  "15711": "Pray, what virtue do you attribute to a letter, which your speech might not possess?",
  "15712": "Can we fly, my friends?",
  "15713": "What should they fear?",
  "15714": "Was he about to learn at last who it was that he loved, who that young girl was?",
  "15715": "Some unique chaplet?",
  "15716": "Who is it that speaks?",
  "15717": "And where are you going?",
  "15718": "The one loves and embraces the subjects of knowledge, the other those of opinion?",
  "15719": "How can that ever be, father?",
  "15720": "Are you mad?",
  "15721": "Would there be any objection to my taking leave of any one I know, about here, before I go away?",
  "15722": "Why, where was you raised?",
  "15723": "Soon, sir?",
  "15724": "Had he hidden some of his magic tools underneath the floor?",
  "15725": "So late, is it?",
  "15726": "Would not the people start up in their seats, by a simultaneous impulse, and tear him down out of the pulpit which he defiled?",
  "15727": "Have you tried to drive a harpoon through a body?",
  "15728": "Did I perhaps learn from it the long clear silence?",
  "15729": "Have men, collectively, no whims, no prejudices?",
  "15730": "What did you pay for that meat?",
  "15731": "Or was it sensible?",
  "15732": "Well, what can I do for you this morning?",
  "15733": "You have money for them, for those loafers?",
  "15734": "Among those which grow lean which is that which grows leanest?",
  "15735": "Who's that grunting?",
  "15736": "What could we care about in the whole world beside, if we belonged to each other?",
  "15737": "To be in love is folly?",
  "15738": "Discarding punctilio and maxims adapted to more manageable times, and looking only to the unprecedentedly stern facts of our case, can you do better in any possible event?",
  "15739": "Had she not given all that she possessed?",
  "15740": "Shall we answer?",
  "15741": "Whose seats the weary traveller repose?",
  "15742": "What are we to do?",
  "15743": "It is really sold, then?",
  "15744": "What was the last word?",
  "15745": "Will you come with me if I win?",
  "15746": "Please, uncle, may I go on the river, then, if I'm not to go into the street?",
  "15747": "You probably know what I am going to tell you, or do you not?",
  "15748": "What do you mean by that?",
  "15749": "And you, monsieur, you were to obtain conditions for us, I think?",
  "15750": "Could you give me something to do for a few days?",
  "15751": "You like that style?",
  "15752": "D'you believe me?",
  "15753": "It was a troubled dream?",
  "15754": "Pain?",
  "15755": "Why do you want to know all this?",
  "15756": "Did I say we could depend upon no better man?",
  "15757": "And what did you reply?",
  "15758": "How can he make out that it is a forgery?",
  "15759": "Your old original one?",
  "15760": "Pray, what are you laughing at?",
  "15761": "For that matter, of what use could it be to me?",
  "15762": "I suppose you've come from there?",
  "15763": "Is it to be the last?",
  "15764": "Well, are we all ready to start now?",
  "15765": "O, fear you the constable?",
  "15766": "What ship's going?",
  "15767": "What had tempted her to imperil both of their lives?",
  "15768": "Who can exhaust the possibilities of their combination?",
  "15769": "How does it go?",
  "15770": "Why had she toyed with the threatening catastrophe?",
  "15771": "It's all right, eh?",
  "15772": "And the bricks?",
  "15773": "Which of them will nationalize the other?",
  "15774": "Your reverence, whither away so quickly?",
  "15775": "If so, where is it?",
  "15776": "Have they heard anything against her?",
  "15777": "Is she very clever?",
  "15778": "To turn you out for?",
  "15779": "Do you wish anything?",
  "15780": "Irritability?",
  "15781": "Have you ever been arrested before?",
  "15782": "Come up?",
  "15783": "Who lost the tails of his coat?",
  "15784": "Who banged the door?",
  "15785": "Did I steal?",
  "15786": "I ask again, is that the way to test the soundness of a doctrine?",
  "15787": "WHEN did he sing out?",
  "15788": "Now, what do you make of four times five?",
  "15789": "Have we not here a picture of his way of life?",
  "15790": "What is it made of?",
  "15791": "Did you strike golden guineas out of solder, young fellow, or shilling coins itself?",
  "15792": "How shall we get down?",
  "15793": "Does it take long to get a nose, now?",
  "15794": "Otherwise, what would become of society?",
  "15795": "Surely now they would find a document which would throw some light upon all the mysteries that had happened?",
  "15796": "To listen, say I?",
  "15797": "You say yes?",
  "15798": "Pray tell me how it happened?",
  "15799": "Now the question is, after what manner this utility and importance operate upon us?",
  "15800": "What makes you a coward?",
  "15801": "But, do you know?",

  "16582": "Was all that sound and many noises yours?",
  "16583": "Who are the sinners figuring in his drunken petitions?",
  "16584": "Why had they not seen him as usual make his fine horse curvet in such beautiful style, to the delight and astonishment of the curious from the king's balcony?",
  "16585": "Who calls so loud?",
  "16586": "I can buy pen, ink, and paper?",
  "16587": "Was it too much for you?",
  "16588": "Where could she have learnt this corruption almost incorporeal in the strength of its profanity and dissimulation?",
  "16589": "And what does it all mean?",
  "16590": "What is it for?",
  "16591": "Can not you see to their release?",
  "16592": "How can perfection spring from such materials?",
  "16593": "Where else could I have been?",
  "16594": "And the rich caparison, is that mine, too?",
  "16595": "And are you no longer so?",
  "16596": "What was the issue?",
  "16597": "Shall I see you home?",
  "16598": "Boofer lady, does 'oo love dadda?",
  "16599": "But how is your fame to be established?",
  "16600": "But what is such a satisfaction in comparison with the happiness of a life?",
  "16601": "Of whom and against whom do you demand that security, sir knight?",
  "16602": "What on earth induced you to do it?",
  "16603": "Or has it become an indistinct apostolic tradition?",
  "16604": "Do you want to say how much?",
  "16605": "Was this cycle not exhausted and brought to a conclusion for him?",
  "16606": "Think any of the boys 'll run?",
  "16607": "Where do you come from now?",
  "16608": "Is that an answer for a wife?",
  "16609": "And will the love of a lie be any part of a philosopher's nature?",
  "16610": "How did you trace it, then?",
  "16611": "Were you ever painted yet?",
  "16612": "Have you no friends who could assist you?",
  "16613": "And then how would you slip it into my pocket?",
  "16614": "Do you know who this is?",
  "16615": "Do you not remember?",
  "16616": "You know that pair of women's gloves?",
  "16617": "Why did you wish for secrecy?",
  "16618": "Your troubles date from the time of your decision to return?",
  "16619": "Well, what do you think?",
  "16620": "Where was he born?",
  "16621": "What did you say?",
  "16622": "You bring me news, do you say?",
  "16623": "Shall I, in cool blood, set loose upon the earth a daemon whose delight is in death and wretchedness?",
  "16624": "Then what do you call the people with whom they're now having tea?",
  "16625": "And why do we need refreshment, my friends?",
  "16626": "And after all, what do we know of ourselves?",
  "16627": "Was it not probable that these symptoms would increase indefinitely, or at least until terminated by death itself?",
  "16628": "Had he not always been sufficient to himself, and now, at fifty, was it likely that he should trust another?",
  "16629": "Shall I see you again soon?",
  "16630": "Who can draw a strict line of demarcation between mind and body?",
  "16631": "Were there two?",
  "16632": "Are people so unhappy when they love?",
  "16633": "What is your object in speaking to me of this?",
  "16634": "On which side?",
  "16635": "Is he not, comte?",
  "16636": "Feel less thirsty after wetting your throat?",
  "16637": "He is, then, I suppose, the prince's jailer?",
  "16638": "Bends he his steps in our direction, child?",
  "16639": "And this is your establishment?",
  "16640": "What are you saying, monsieur?",
  "16641": "Who will make the law?",
  "16642": "Why, are you a doctor, prince, or what?",
  "16643": "Not for long, surely?",
  "16644": "How could she get that?",
  "16645": "Are you acquainted with her?",
  "16646": "About what, mama?",
  "16647": "Then what has become of the mummy?",
  "16648": "Mama, how can you sit and hear such statements?",
  "16649": "How can you ask?",
  "16650": "What had she done to excite the malice of an enemy?",
  "16651": "You do not love me, then?",
  "16652": "Where have you come from, my dear count?",
  "16653": "Why then, as I perused them, did the hairs of my head erect themselves on end, and the blood of my body become congealed within my veins?",
  "16654": "And will you not so much honour me and so help me as to read it for me?",
  "16655": "And I shall not see her before you start?",
  "16656": "Or is his gravity only in appearance?",
  "16657": "How can that be done?",
  "16658": "How can we keep company with you?",
  "16659": "Oliver, what's the news?",
  "16660": "Are you?",
  "16661": "If we come soon can you go a piece wid us?",
  "16662": "What rank did he hold on board?",
  "16663": "Do I show it?",
  "16664": "What will but felt the fleshly screen?",
  "16665": "If a superior man abandon virtue, how can he fulfil the requirements of that name?",
  "16666": "Hopes hovering in the near future as well as sorrows born of the past?",
  "16667": "But what ails you, father?",
  "16668": "Where are you going, wife?",
  "16669": "On business?",
  "16670": "Do you smell this little marsh?",
  "16671": "And reasoning is peculiarly his instrument?",
  "16672": "How the devil is one to get the intention of the soul except by painting exactly what one sees?",
  "16673": "None of my knaves there?",
  "16674": "Have you been waiting long?",
  "16675": "Or evil expectations?",
  "16676": "By the way, papa, where do you make the explosives?",
  "16677": "But who is this that breaks upon me?",
  "16678": "Why do you shout so?",
  "16679": "What must I promise?",
  "16680": "And you have accepted him?",
  "16681": "And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?",
  "16682": "Do you mean the bo'sun?",
  "16683": "To its address, my lord?",
  "16684": "What made you think it was she?",
  "16685": "What shall I say, madam?",
  "16686": "I believe I've only had the honour of seeing you once myself?",
  "16687": "I told him, and he was attentive until I had finished, and then burst out laughing again, and asked me if I was sore afterwards?",
  "16688": "Has the proud young lady gone?",
  "16689": "And did you also discover a bitter taste?",
  "16690": "Should he find that place in this city if he could get there?",
  "16691": "Must I give up my place to your eminence, or shall I continue?",
  "16692": "Shall I be fatal to your happiness?",
  "16693": "Then why not come to it?",
  "16694": "Who in the dance so fleet?",
  "16695": "What are you reading now?",
  "16696": "You saw the captain?",
  "16697": "What say you to that?",
  "16698": "If the question is put, why do men desire to deposit their life outside their bodies?",
  "16699": "Well, but shall we not meet again?",
  "16700": "When you said that, did you mean that it seemed to you to be louder than the second one?",
  "16701": "We are almost drowned here amongst these lettuce, shall we speak?",
  "16702": "But it is long ago?",
  "16703": "How can I explain that infatuation?",
  "16704": "Well, what did he say about me?",
  "16705": "Are they boys?",
  "16706": "Do you affirm that?",
  "16707": "And who is to pursue him?",
  "16708": "May we not then conjecture that these rules are in fact the very safeguards which we should expect to find adopted for the protection of the king's life?",
  "16709": "Are you really sad?",
  "16710": "And where are your sisters?",
  "16711": "Well, what have you got to say to me?",
  "16712": "Has there been any inconsistency on his side to create alarm?",
  "16713": "How does it differ from soul?",
  "16714": "And what effect did this discourse produce?",
  "16715": "Rather a good marriage this, I believe?",
  "16716": "Which way is not despair?",
  "16717": "And what brings you up here under somebody else's name?",
  "16718": "May it not be that the utopists find it easier to expatiate upon these grand words than to seriously study social manifestations?",
  "16719": "Are you looking for anything?",
  "16720": "Did she perform any ceremony befitting it, or what did she do?",
  "16721": "Let me see, what harvest shall we have?",
  "16722": "To us forever are the gates of heaven shut, for who shall open them to us again?",
  "16723": "And now what is to be done?",
  "16724": "You say that she must have come back this way?",
  "16725": "There, NOW do you understand?",
  "16726": "What is the matter with you, you fool?",
  "16727": "Could he trust himself to come down to breakfast a free man in the morning?",
  "16728": "Could she make that sacrifice?",
  "16729": "Now, what in the world ailed the creature?",
  "16730": "Will they never bring that emetic?",
  "16731": "What have we to do?",
  "16732": "He did not marry this accomplished young lady?",
  "16733": "Who says man and wife are bad company?",
  "16734": "Who is to dance?",
  "16735": "That's all you know of him?",
  "16736": "But what business had rushes there, or I among them?",
  "16737": "And in what part of it?",
  "16738": "What have you been doing since I last saw you?",
  "16739": "Did she suffer from heart complaint?",
  "16740": "Could you come?",
  "16741": "Where are these papers, then?",
  "16742": "Yes, but where's your special world?",
  "16743": "Shall you not need an instrument similar to the one which you used yesterday?",
  "16744": "And you've no security?",
  "16745": "And you were his comfort through everything?",
  "16746": "But will he then live for ever?",
  "16747": "When is it likely to come to an end?",
  "16748": "In which, sir?",
  "16749": "At school?",
  "16750": "Greshamsbury?",
  "16751": "Shall I repent of it?",
  "16752": "And do well, I am sure?",
  "16753": "Who brought me here?",
  "16754": "To what extent?",
  "16755": "But whom send I to judge them?",
  "16756": "Now I am sure that you would not be too proud to earn the price of a new dress, would you?",
  "16757": "Where is the key?",
  "16758": "Shall we go together?",
  "16759": "What cable?",
  "16760": "Does he make any conditions?",
  "16761": "Does he say the quotations from his own speech are forgeries?",
  "16762": "Was it a sarpent?",
  "16763": "In different states shall the magistrates be different or the same?",
  "16764": "May not my love, my life, my duty, try to repay the confidence you have shown me?",
  "16765": "You want a pretext, do you not?",
  "16766": "What would the enemy say?",
  "16767": "To whom do you desire to leave this fortune?",
  "16768": "Have you anything to say at all?",
  "16769": "But tell me, is it a civilized country?",
  "16770": "Did you never hear that?",
  "16771": "You mean when money is not wanted, but allowed to lie?",
  "16772": "Perhaps you cannot talk now?",
  "16773": "What do you intend?",
  "16774": "Or do you decline and dissent from this?",
  "16775": "And we have lost an opportunity to get back to our country?",
  "16776": "What, mother?",
  "16777": "And what's this?",
  "16778": "How could you mistake me so?",
  "16779": "What is the matter, gentlemen?",
  "16780": "Are we softened a little?",
  "16781": "How are you getting on with your woman?",
  "16782": "Socrates, what do you mean?",
  "16783": "Six children, sir?",
  "16784": "D'you mean to say you can look at the painting of that flesh and say it's not good?",
  "16785": "Are you not ashamed of yourself?",
  "16786": "Does she know where he has gone to?",
  "16787": "No friends?",
  "16788": "Are they yoked?",
  "16789": "Besides, why should I die?",
  "16790": "How should the bells be rung?",
  "16791": "What sort of a lady is she?",
  "16792": "But am I to remain always alone in this vast and dismal chamber?",
  "16793": "Do you know she is a very virtuous woman?",
  "16794": "Canst drink the waters of the crisped spring?",
  "16795": "What's that you've got?",
  "16796": "What is the difference?",
  "16797": "Will you look at them?",
  "16798": "How shall the mother summon courage to bid him adieu?",
  "16799": "What sort of night was it?",
  "16800": "Your younger sisters must be very young?",
  "16801": "So soon as that?",
  "16802": "My dear, how am I to say?",
  "16803": "Why, what would you do with them?",
  "16804": "Would she have him fire off real guns, and have his hair cut, and his whiskers shaved, and his eyes turned right and left, and his trousers pipeclayed?",
  "16805": "And after all, what did it matter to me, and why did it matter to me?",
  "16806": "But, if you love me you would like me to be your husband?",
  "16807": "And their names?",
  "16808": "Why did you not ask for me at my room if you were in the hotel?",
  "16809": "Ilyin?",
  "16810": "Should not their custom be to spare them, considering the danger which there is that the whole race may one day fall under the yoke of the barbarians?",
  "16811": "Had he been dreaming?",
  "16812": "MacCallum who, sir?",
  "16813": "Why deprive myself of the actual charm of my enjoyments to inform others what I enjoyed?",
  "16814": "My hay for the district?",
  "16815": "What is your proposal?",
  "16816": "And then you heard nothing until you read the reports of the death in the paper?",
  "16817": "How, go then?",
  "16818": "Is he ALWAYS hungry?",
  "16819": "Are you sure it was me?",
  "16820": "Why not history?",
  "16821": "Why do you ask such an unnecessary question?",
  "16822": "Who were his parents?",
  "16823": "Come to see the old man, hay?",
  "16824": "We have the resources, but are we fully ready to use them?",
  "16825": "What shall I do to him, sahib?",
  "16826": "Do you wish to come in?",
  "16827": "Pray, how came you to know that men were formerly fools?",
  "16828": "Oh, is this true what you say?",
  "16829": "You call THAT something to lend?",
  "16830": "Shall we condescend to legislate on any of these particulars?",
  "16831": "Meanwhile, what are you going to do?",
  "16832": "But where was his mind?",
  "16833": "And the matter seems serious to you?",
  "16834": "What's sov'rin, and what's c'u'nity?",
  "16835": "What is it that once or twice they have quarreled with the governor, and because they would not yield have been proclaimed?",
  "16836": "How do you find yourself today?",
  "16837": "When would they return, and how?",
  "16838": "What business had he to talk to her about being taken away from uncles and aunts?",
  "16839": "What is there in the tents?",
  "16840": "Where were you going now?",
  "16841": "His blankets?",
  "16842": "Why not let me take a farm?",
  "16843": "Dare you answer me thus?",
  "16844": "Why, but do you speak this seriously?",
  "16845": "You have nothing else to tell us?",
  "16846": "Could it have lived an hour as happily?",
  "16847": "Would it degrade me as much as to break my faith with the helpless?",
  "16848": "Whom will you send for?",
  "16849": "Now, could she do it?",
  "16850": "All safe inside?",
  "16851": "Well, boys, how does it feel to be in space once more?",
  "16852": "What do you mean by making such a racket?",
  "16853": "But if I accept the appointment, and yet disagree with the bishop, what then?",
  "16854": "Where should she live?",
  "16855": "Have I not tended that dear couch for years?",
  "16856": "Are we not as much so as you?",
  "16857": "Will you meet me there?",
  "16858": "What have I to do, to free myself for ever of your visits, but to abandon you to your deserts?",
  "16859": "Fusion, fusion, this horrible fusion of two beings, which every woman and most men insisted on, was it not nauseous and horrible anyhow, whether it was a fusion of the spirit or of the emotional body?",
  "16860": "What could be the meaning of it?",
  "16861": "Good news, then?",
  "16862": "What is it called, dear guardian?",
  "16863": "Two leagues beyond the summit of the hill?",
  "16864": "Whose for choice?",
  "16865": "Has the rain wrecked the road?",
  "16866": "I ask you now, is such a theory tenable?",
  "16867": "How are you feeling this morning?",
  "16868": "Canoeing?",
  "16869": "How would it be from now on?",
  "16870": "How could he, poor boy?",
  "16871": "Well, on the road itself?",
  "16872": "And how should he know them?",
  "16873": "You will do all you can do, your excellency?",
  "16874": "Where was I?",
  "16875": "Is that your opinion, D'Herblay?",
  "16876": "Into what room did you take him?",
  "16877": "He hesitated to give it to you?",
  "16878": "Or is it only your good luck?",
  "16879": "Where and when?",
  "16880": "What do you expect me to do?",
  "16881": "Much here else?",
  "16882": "Do you think it will be long before he comes in?",
  "16883": "The father's?",
  "16884": "Did he not lunch with you, cousin?",
  "16885": "Of what, mamma?",
  "16886": "Shall I?",
  "16887": "Who will marry such a one?",
  "16888": "Ariosto?",
  "16889": "Shall I tell him of your gratitude?",
  "16890": "How came you to be awake?",
  "16891": "What is it we're going to see?",
  "16892": "Would you like to go into the parlor?",
  "16893": "While his soul had passed from ecstasy to languor where had she been?",
  "16894": "Aint dis here my lef eye for sartain?",
  "16895": "What does it matter whether he does or not?",
  "16896": "Is this nothing?",
  "16897": "Whither go you now?",
  "16898": "Moliere?",
  "16899": "I think only one of your rooms is engaged as yet, is it not?",
  "16900": "Should I not desire its prosperity and its happiness?",
  "16901": "And from what country?",
  "16902": "How did he look?",
  "16903": "Will you be more happy at home?",
  "16904": "What is it, deary?",
  "16905": "But, after all, in order to see, the light must exceed the darkness, and in the midst of the darkness in the water, how can you see?",
  "16906": "Do her friends know my story also?",
  "16907": "You refuse to answer?",
  "16908": "To send a gentleman after him?",
  "16909": "Get over what?",
  "16910": "What have you got to do?",
  "16911": "Was it?",
  "16912": "Does your excellency happen to be hungry?",
  "16913": "Can two passengers in yonder street be more unlike each other than the soul is to the soul after an interval of twenty years?",
  "16914": "A boat?",
  "16915": "What do the people want this time?",
  "16916": "Is he going to make it manslaughter, or what's he going to make of it?",
  "16917": "And even to this are there not exceptions?",
  "16918": "Do you never search your heart and shudder at the horrible degradation which you have brought on yourself by sheer weakness of will?",
  "16919": "I am to remain minister, then?",
  "16920": "In a year?",
  "16921": "What does her clever stepfather do then?",
  "16922": "What story can I invent?",
  "16923": "Have you not managed to get out of it?",
  "16924": "Veteran, you must have been often wounded?",

  "16926": "You're there, are you?",
  "16927": "Who is your district ruler?",
  "16928": "What have they to show for their famous conservatories?",
  "16929": "Offensively so?",

  "16932": "Had they tried to get a doctor?",
  "16933": "Where do they get the feathers?",
  "16934": "I hope your father is quite well?",
  "16935": "What's that to you?",
  "16936": "And why do you not go with him?",
  "16937": "And these beings, composed of such noble materials of thinking and feeling, have they only melted into the elements to keep in motion the grand mass of life?",
  "16938": "Do you prefer reading to cards?",
  "16939": "Stay, who nurses him?",
  "16940": "Shall we excuse the desertion of his standard, a treacherous desertion which abandoned the victory to the enemies of his benefactor?",
  "16941": "Will you not answer?",
  "16942": "But what name?",
  "16943": "Has any one ever heard it alleged that, from our complete and necessary ignorance of the conditions, it is uncertain what exact relation the diameter of a circle bears to the circle in rational or irrational numbers?",
  "16944": "Did I see it?",

  "19355": "Then why will you not be my wife?",
  "19356": "In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?",
  "19357": "But who else COULD it be, my very dear prince?",
  "19358": "Do you think it would be unfriendly of me if I said I was busy?",
  "19359": "How old is she?",
  "19360": "WILL you shake hands?",
  "19361": "Did you ever hear of a dog running up a curtain?",
  "19362": "What is all my world after?",
  "19363": "And suppose he should say all he knows?",
  "19364": "Whether they are going to convict, or whatever it is, that dreadful soldier?",
  "19365": "Do you see this diamond?",
  "19366": "Why did he not go?",
  "19367": "Who was this man who held in his finger these curiously variegated links of an unknown chain?",
  "19368": "How much may not a few months do?",
  "19369": "What would this chamber of justice do?",
  "19370": "Well, yes, you are right, I am a fool, why not simply remain here?",
  "19371": "Are you going to shoot me?",
  "19372": "Oh, do you know that it is cruel never to name the name of the loved one?",
  "19373": "Is he quiet?",
  "19374": "A girl, is it?",
  "19375": "Shall a curiosity, which seems to lead nowhere, be satisfied?",
  "19376": "Was there no injustice in this?",
  "19377": "A dead dog, or rabbits, or what?",
  "19378": "Have you plotted to drown me?",
  "19379": "Oh, where was he?",
  "19380": "If I might make a suggestion, sir?",
  "19381": "What decision?",
  "19382": "Have you a mind to go ashore there?",
  "19383": "From number sixty?",
  "19384": "Or was the projectile nothing now but a metal coffin, bearing three corpses into space?",
  "19385": "What is the difficulty?",
  "19386": "How could you shut me out, bear it all alone?",
  "19387": "Would it be an indiscretion to ask to see those precious pills?",
  "19388": "And who is the cause of all this annoyance?",
  "19389": "After this, what more can be wanted?",
  "19390": "Tame?",
  "19391": "Will you take these mementos to him?",
  "19392": "And WHERE has he gone?",
  "19393": "But what is the point of it?",
  "19394": "Might it not be possible that the cheque having thus fallen into her husband's hands, he had come, after a while, to think that it had been sent to him by his friend, the dean?",
  "19395": "And what good is it to the bubble while it holds together, or what harm when it is burst?",
  "19396": "What are you going to do with yourselves after you get settled?",
  "19397": "Is that it, my dear?",
  "19398": "If one is not to get into a rage sometimes, what is the good of being friends?",
  "19399": "Where shall I put all this treasure, and which way shall I go?",
  "19400": "Why not mention these almost divinely childish sayings of kindness?",
  "19401": "Awake?",
  "19402": "Bucket?",
  "19403": "Is any rule more plain than this, that whoever voluntarily gives to another irresistible power over human beings is bound to take order that such power shall not be barbarously abused?",
  "19404": "I say so because what amount of persuasion could have persuaded me that there are apes in the world that can divine as I have seen now with my own eyes?",
  "19405": "WHICH one is the poet?",
  "19406": "What if her nerve had given way under the strain?",
  "19407": "What are you up to, little man?",
  "19408": "More powerful than my mother, then?",
  "19409": "You are convinced?",
  "19410": "Yes, why?",
  "19411": "Where did she live?",
  "19412": "Good?",
  "19413": "You love me?",
  "19414": "Why are you so impatient?",
  "19415": "Well, what if it is?",
  "19416": "Shall I ever forget the triple horror of that spectacle?",
  "19417": "Do you deny that?",
  "19418": "Will you turn the hay over to us, the hay in the old stack?",
  "19419": "But that way of arguing by imaginary instances is not supposed to be genuine, is it?",
  "19420": "Or am I going mad?",
  "19421": "What is the price?",
  "19422": "On what shall I reflect?",
  "19423": "So near, are we?",
  "19424": "And will it cost much?",
  "19425": "We are not wrong therefore in calling them necessary?",
  "19426": "Gentlemen, did you ever see a scorpion pinned to a wall?",
  "19427": "But what about the lamps?",
  "19428": "But then?",
  "19429": "And me, too?",
  "19430": "I suppose you gave a goodish figure for him?",
  "19431": "A surprise?",
  "19432": "Why cannot we launch into space through the scuttle?",
  "19433": "Is that what you wish for?",
  "19434": "Die for it?",
  "19435": "They must have been mistaken, surely?",
  "19436": "Absolutely?",
  "19437": "Is this the recompense you had in store for me?",
  "19438": "Shall I go and see if I can find them?",
  "19439": "Will you let me try to mend it for you?",
  "19440": "And for ever?",
  "19441": "You whom I regard as the last word, the last charming and delightful word, in modern womanhood?",
  "19442": "To avoid this dilemma what is proposed?",
  "19443": "Well, have there been reviews of your book?",
  "19444": "Kiss any of them?",
  "19445": "Would he really be permitted to lean on his father's broad breast once more?",
  "19446": "Have you had board and lodging too?",
  "19447": "Frequently?",
  "19448": "What might the staying of my blood portend?",
  "19449": "Mother, do you see this?",
  "19450": "Have you so soon forgotten from whom you received the foolish instrument you hold in your hand?",
  "19451": "Are periodical visits made to the grave?",
  "19452": "Well, now then, the count?",
  "19453": "Whether he had any accomplices, or whatever the thing is called in the law?",
  "19454": "You think it will come to that?",
  "19455": "Cut a man?",
  "19456": "But is there no mitigating circumstance?",
  "19457": "Who are these gentlemen whom you have brought with you?",
  "19458": "Anything down there about your souls?",
  "19459": "What can she do?",
  "19460": "Is there no remedy for this?",
  "19461": "Is this small saving or frugality?",
  "19462": "In danger from you?",
  "19463": "Was the veil about to be rent?",
  "19464": "What were you saying to this youngster?",
  "19465": "Where have you been hiding yourself, you naughty boy?",
  "19466": "How dare you call me flimsy?",
  "19467": "For if the living spring from any other things, and they too die, must not all things at last be swallowed up in death?",
  "19468": "Had she betrayed him?",
  "19469": "Heart, what will you say if this be the appendix or label to both you indentures?",
  "19470": "Witty?",
  "19471": "Did I tell you to come around to day?",
  "19472": "You remember that fellow who came upon the evening before you left us?",
  "19473": "And you did not believe him when he said that?",
  "19474": "How can they?",
  "19475": "And always with the same lady?",
  "19476": "Have you read his article?",
  "19477": "So, then, they drew up the indictments before the king was taken?",
  "19478": "But eternal justice?",
  "19479": "Can you wonder I'm lonesome?",
  "19480": "Is it us?",
  "19481": "Then what do you hope for?",
  "19482": "Is it sweetening yet?",
  "19483": "Should he give to his cowardice the pretext of patriotism?",
  "19484": "What did you let her bring you for?",
  "19485": "At what solution should he arrive?",
  "19486": "Shall I call up our men from beyond the hill?",
  "19487": "My marriage?",
  "19488": "When did such a massacre occur?",
  "19489": "Do you know the town at all?",
  "19490": "Is it because you love her so passionately?",
  "19491": "What is he after?",
  "19492": "Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison?",
  "19493": "Does this oath satisfy you?",
  "19494": "Do you know what you fear most?",
  "19495": "And nothing but them?",
  "19496": "And what did you there?",
  "19497": "Then the guilty person is absolutely in custody?",
  "19498": "For whom the labor?",
  "19499": "What, how, why?",
  "19500": "How am I to know, madam, that in your selection of lovers, you are not equally eccentric?",
  "19501": "Any other point, sir?",
  "19502": "What d' you think o' that?",
  "19503": "What's the odds?",
  "19504": "What are they?",
  "19505": "What vial and what balsam is that?",
  "19506": "How could you, how could you believe it?",
  "19507": "What has happened to the pretty boy?",
  "19508": "But where IS father?",
  "19509": "Are there many new women today?",
  "19510": "Will you let me have another cup?",
  "19511": "Is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think?",
  "19512": "What are you up to, now?",
  "19513": "Shall I have my son a stager now?",
  "19514": "Whither did he go?",
  "19515": "Pratt?",
  "19516": "Would she?",
  "19517": "Am I insulting?",
  "19518": "How could he order his public execution, and yet, in his letters to the senate, exculpate himself from the guilt of his death?",
  "19519": "And why are you glad?",
  "19520": "Has she told you?",
  "19521": "Are we to go?",
  "19522": "Can one get married as quickly as that?",
  "19523": "By the way, am I your cousin, or am I not?",
  "19524": "Whose opinion is to decide who are the wisest and best?",
  "19525": "What is it to exclude?",
  "19526": "He has agents, then, throughout the world?",
  "19527": "Have you relied on the fidelity of your confederates?",
  "19528": "How is it you're defending him?",
  "19529": "A stranger in these parts?",
  "19530": "Was my uncle beside himself?",
  "19531": "Do you find, sir, said I, that I encouraged his proposal, or do you not?",
  "19532": "Now, governor, the sum?",
  "19533": "But do you know who rescued her?",
  "19534": "Finally, what still remained to be sacrificed?",
  "19535": "Where are you from?",
  "19536": "I wonder who it can be?",
  "19537": "His duty?",
  "19538": "Change the sir to one less poignant?",
  "19539": "What's the use of writing at all if nobody can understand it?",
  "19540": "Another enemy to harass me in my misery?",
  "19541": "Do none suggest themselves?",
  "19542": "And where does one take the air in this island?",
  "19543": "What is that dim outline?",
  "19544": "You have no further doubt, captain, of the nature of the animal?",
  "19545": "Shall we leave the cart in the wood?",
  "19546": "Where, in what manner, was your prisoner found?",
  "19547": "How long has this been going on?",
  "19548": "Have you anything to say to us, my friend, or what do you want?",
  "19549": "General, why have we not had any ices?",
  "19550": "But what have I done?",
  "19551": "Shall we go there?",
  "19552": "Mirabell, did you take exceptions last night?",
  "19553": "What did he think?",
  "19554": "Whom do they hate most?",
  "19555": "Come, now, what are your conditions?",
  "19556": "Was any other bicycle missing?",
  "19557": "What's the good of denying it, my dear?",
  "19558": "Do you think, then, monsieur, that we shall travel faster with two horses apiece?",
  "19559": "A nonentity, sir?",
  "19560": "Did they lose their provisions and starve in the desert?",
  "19561": "But how could she reach it?",
  "19562": "Those who recommend a contempt of mankind, and those who inculcate a reverence for humanity?",
  "19563": "How slowly do the houres theyr numbers spend?",
  "19564": "Do I understand that you will take her with you?",
  "19565": "Great statesmen err, and why not small medical men?",
  "19566": "And none of your people had by chance been to see you?",
  "19567": "Do you not perceive that it would be an agent of safety instead of destruction?",
  "19568": "You see no difficulty, heh?",
  "19569": "Will that do?",
  "19570": "If, then, the question is asked, in relation to transcendental theology,* first, whether there is anything distinct from the world, which contains the ground of cosmical order and connection according to general laws?",
  "19571": "For what sin, or for what crime?",
  "19572": "Like any warm water?",
  "19573": "To reflect?",
  "19574": "How does this bear on the case?",
  "19575": "Well, supposing I and the others refused to serve, as you are doing?",
  "19576": "We?",
  "19577": "Which is worse?",
  "19578": "Well, then, what are they FOR?",
  "19579": "Why did you bring me away?",
  "19580": "You've just come?",
  "19581": "She has a pretty face, has she not?",
  "19582": "But would it make his life harder if we were to see each other sometimes?",
  "19583": "You wished to see me, your lordship?",
  "19584": "By the way, DID he beat you?",
  "19585": "How did the man give it you?",
  "19586": "Who lost it?",
  "19587": "Nothing of what?",
  "19588": "Do you imagine that the convicts will not see you leave it, that they will not allow you to enter the forest, and that they will not attack it during your absence, knowing that there is no one here but a wounded boy and a man?",
  "19589": "And what did these two sovereigns give you in exchange for these magnificent presents?",
  "19590": "If there be no unchanging mirror, bright and clean, bow can there be the various images, unreal and temporary, reflected in it?",
  "19591": "Who are all these people?",
  "19592": "What is it, sir?",
  "19593": "But has she told you nothing?",
  "19594": "Have you no wish in reference to your case?",
  "19595": "That was the way, was it?",
  "19596": "Nothing shall stay me now short of death, and should I die, my friends, will you take oath to prosecute the search for her and bring her back in safety to her grandfather's court?",
  "19597": "Does she refuse me?",
  "19598": "And now tell me, father, while we are still in friendly country, if you know of any resources that I could make my own?",
  "19599": "What's the matter, are you asleep?",
  "19600": "Was my maternal parent aware, in a word, of my absence from the domiciliary residence?",
  "19601": "As we are imagining what is impossible and absurd, suppose we change the subject?",
  "19602": "Is that what he rang for?",
  "19603": "Where will she go?",
  "19604": "Charley does?",
  "19605": "Do you think they have recognized us?",
  "19606": "Do you release her from her promise?",
  "19607": "Why a battle, in the first place?",
  "19608": "When will you go?",
  "19609": "They have in view practice only, and are always speaking?",
  "19610": "She has told you?",
  "19611": "What then is become of that friendship and confidence, and by what means have I lost them?",
  "19612": "Is it a bargain, or is it not?",
  "19613": "Heldar?",
  "19614": "Never even hinted, for instance, that your patron might have views as to your marriage ultimately?",
  "19615": "Do you know of whom I mean to speak?",
  "19616": "So much the worse, is it?",
  "19617": "You would accept?",
  "19618": "They do very well here?",
  "19619": "What was the reason?",
  "19620": "How many have you?",
  "19621": "Shall it be brandy and water?",
  "19622": "How was it, when I saw the personal, the selfish point of view of the voice, that I did not suspect some impostor?",
  "19623": "What should I stay for?",
  "19624": "Do you see this russet?",
  "19625": "What aim, what purpose, what ambition in life have you now?",
  "19626": "How are we to distinguish those that are always valid from others?",
  "19627": "What would that other channel probably be?",
  "19628": "Have you not retained an hotel?",
  "19629": "Was it not very extraordinary that you should do this on the very day when there were these papers inside?",
  "19630": "But would you have any objections to my laying down before the fire?",
  "19631": "How many are of your party?",
  "19632": "Ow d'you know there's going to be a next time?",
  "19633": "Percerin?",
  "19634": "Are you in fear of me still?",
  "19635": "Do I know her?",
  "19636": "Did you know?",
  "19637": "Tell me, are you this young fellow's father?",
  "19638": "Does it?",
  "19639": "Is that far?",
  "19640": "Do you suppose, for a moment, he will not recognise that?",
  "19641": "Have you indeed?",
  "19642": "And his address?",
  "19643": "And yet, what could have happened?",
  "19644": "Will it not, sir?",
  "19645": "Now, why need you do it?",
  "19646": "You have got out insurances on our lives and want to give way with their oars, and pocket the proceeds, do ye?",
  "19647": "If these be the effects of friendship, what are those of enmity?",
  "19648": "How then, upon what conditions, in what sense, can a principle which is its own denial enter into science?",
  "19649": "Come, when do you wish our marriage to be signed in a vestry?",
  "19650": "The name of this creek, my friends?",
  "19651": "About those three or four gentlemen whom you wish to invite here?",
  "19652": "Why do you want the rest?",
  "19653": "Do your people talk about that too?",
  "19654": "Tulliver?",
  "19655": "What do you do instead?",
  "19656": "Why does your ladyship ask?",
  "19657": "Would they be naughty then?",
  "19658": "Was it a bet?",
  "19659": "How dare you come in so?",
  "19660": "But who was to lead the men?",
  "19661": "Or a sausage or something?",
  "19662": "Or was it some one who was with the thief who did it in order to prevent the crime?",
  "19663": "What period?",
  "19664": "Or are we going to hell for orders?",
  "19665": "How could you begin?",
  "19666": "How do you know I am old?",
  "19667": "Why this craving for change?",
  "19668": "But in what way?",
  "19669": "Had he come on board alone?",
  "19670": "How many skates you reckon we'll need?",
  "19671": "Do you ever plant things here?",
  "19672": "And when shall we arrive?",
  "19673": "It's a secret, then?",
  "19674": "Were you in the room when he protested so vehemently that he did not know where he got the money?",
  "19675": "Is it possible that I liked to do what I might not, simply and for no other reason than because I might not?",
  "19676": "What would become of me, if I tried to escape from pain?",
  "19677": "And now?",
  "19678": "Here?",
  "19679": "What have you done, then?",
  "19680": "Supposing we escape on foot?",
  "19681": "When will this organ of popular interests and the electoral reform cease to hire sceptics and spread doubt?",
  "19682": "Not for money?",
  "19683": "And how would you set about it?",
  "19684": "How, then, may you accomplish the impossible?",
  "19685": "And then, sir, do you wish me to speak freely to you?",
  "19686": "Really, have you had a vision of the seven fat kine and the seven lean kine?",
  "19687": "What light then does our new material throw upon traditional origins of civilization?",
  "19688": "Do you know that you are quite rude?",
  "19689": "Why not call it then frankly his complete success?",
  "19690": "In my house?",
  "19691": "Then where will you be?",
  "19692": "But how in the world can it be done?",
  "19693": "And what shall I do now?",
  "19694": "How was it, then?",
  "19695": "By intuition?",
  "19696": "What is the letter that she holds?",
  "19697": "Whose tongue is music now?",
  "19698": "How interpret you that passage?",
  "19699": "Were not they very careful to entertain them well, punctually to look unto them, and to attend them faithfully and circumspectly?",
  "19700": "In what way can I be of service to you?",
  "19701": "HAS he been hiding ever since?",
  "19702": "Much hurt?",
  "19703": "In fear of what?",
  "19704": "Who called me?",
  "19705": "No friend but you?",
  "19706": "Then you're a wizard?",
  "19707": "Are we enthralled with material things, less appreciative of the nobility of work and sacrifice?",
  "19708": "It makes no difference about those four crowns, but why did you get up like this?",
  "19709": "Well, well?",
  "19710": "How began the quarrel betwixt you, ha?",
  "19711": "Why did not you place her on my bed against the moment of my waking?",
  "19712": "What happened there?",
  "19713": "What, then, must other tracts be, more desert than this desert?",
  "19714": "Now, what's that for?",
  "19715": "With what object?",
  "19716": "Did you not get my telegram?",
  "19717": "For what purpose could the enumeration of particular powers be inserted, if these and all others were meant to be included in the preceding general power?",
  "19718": "Then how can you believe anything at all?",
  "19719": "Will you complete me, and let me complete you?",
  "19720": "Nothing?",
  "19721": "How much of futurity did he see?",
  "19722": "What are you thinking of?",
  "19723": "What do I see, friends?",
  "19724": "What do you ask me to do?",
  "19725": "She has never behaved like this before, then?",
  "19726": "Are you not satisfied with your own?",
  "19727": "Do you think it necessary to write it?",
  "19728": "And who is it, uncle?",
  "19729": "What now to her was the archdeacon's arrogance, her sister's coldness, or her dear father's weakness?",
  "19730": "Did they, when in the throes of such competition, send formal notice to their rivals of their plans to get the better of them in commerce?",
  "19731": "And must he be more earnest to seduce me, because I dread of all things to be seduced, and would rather lose my life than my honesty?",
  "19732": "Is there not also a second class of goods, such as knowledge, sight, health, which are desirable not only in themselves, but also for their results?",
  "19733": "Why was that?",
  "19734": "What was the population?",
  "19735": "What is the difference between eternal life, fixed and constant, and eternal death?",
  "19736": "Children?",
  "19737": "Was there not some snare laid for her?",
  "19738": "Can you tell with what instruments they did it?",
  "19739": "What now must your poor daughter do?",
  "19740": "Would he have refrained from marrying her?",
  "19741": "What if my sister loue some other knight?",
  "19742": "When charity has its martyrs, why has it not its amateurs?",
  "19743": "Want to see what whaling is, eh?",
  "19744": "What is the matter, sire?",
  "19745": "Where else?",
  "19746": "Why grieves my son?",

  "22117": "Where am I?",
  "22118": "What particulars would your excellency like to hear?",
  "22119": "And now what?",
  "22120": "Do you call this a free country?",
  "22121": "Why do we want guaranteed private insurance?",
  "22122": "The higher man?",
  "22123": "What do you do?",
  "22124": "Who do you think will win her?",
  "22125": "Why not leave the other being, free, why try to absorb, or melt, or merge?",
  "22126": "Why respect?",
  "22127": "If he took her out of the streets, then it would be the same?",
  "22128": "That I was making an ass of myself?",
  "22129": "What must you think of me?",
  "22130": "How did I come to do it?",
  "22131": "But what are we to do there?",
  "22132": "Why should not the guilty ones sooner avail themselves of this unutterable solace?",
  "22133": "You are pleased to reproach me, your excellency, but what if I prove that I am right after all?",
  "22134": "Why is he weeping?",
  "22135": "What were rain and storm to me?",
  "22136": "By the way, what do you give him?",
  "22137": "Do you remember her name?",
  "22138": "Catherine, what have you done?",
  "22139": "The third, then, fell from the clouds, I suppose?",
  "22140": "Dagley?",
  "22141": "Could there be plainer speech than this?",
  "22142": "Where, dearest?",
  "22143": "Good sport, gentlemen?",
  "22144": "What sort of work?",
  "22145": "Now, what'll you bet?",
  "22146": "You fool, why do you catch at a straw?",
  "22147": "Was it not a new record in the annals of science?",
  "22148": "There you are, my partner, eh?",
  "22149": "Where was his boyhood now?",
  "22150": "In that hotel?",
  "22151": "Love gives out in the last issues?",
  "22152": "How, then, do you distinguish the real cause of pain from that of pleasure?",
  "22153": "You think that he has quitted the island?",
  "22154": "You knew him in your world?",
  "22155": "Well, and what is your business?",
  "22156": "Is he tame?",
  "22157": "How would it come?",
  "22158": "What's the use of talking about that?",
  "22159": "But, when stating these excellent arguments, did you ask yourself, sir, whither would tend such a transformation of our system of mortgages?",
  "22160": "But if I hate him?",
  "22161": "Those are all?",
  "22162": "Will you come up and see us while we're there?",
  "22163": "What have I done to deserve this?",
  "22164": "Go where?",
  "22165": "How much would you ask if you were me?",
  "22166": "You say that it was I?",
  "22167": "Nolly, dear?",
  "22168": "Who are all these with you?",
  "22169": "You're quite a sailor, I suppose?",
  "22170": "I think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?",
  "22171": "The unfortunate thing is, where does his GO go to, what becomes of it?",
  "22172": "What do you reckon it is?",
  "22173": "When was this done?",
  "22174": "I hope that I have made myself clear?",
  "22175": "What good would a proclamation of emancipation from me do, especially as we are now situated?",
  "22176": "Where are the horses?",
  "22177": "How long are you down for?",
  "22178": "What do you conclude, then?",
  "22179": "Why did she not recognize him?",
  "22180": "Was he going to ignore her, was he going to take no further notice of her secret?",
  "22181": "Am I in love again?",
  "22182": "What do you think of a chest concealed in a wall?",
  "22183": "To miss?",
  "22184": "Supposing I should like to know?",
  "22185": "Have you peashooters?",
  "22186": "I suppose you've got talipes equinus?",
  "22187": "Where is the blood to come from?",
  "22188": "Did I think that because I was a baronet I could do what I liked?",
  "22189": "And where did you hear it?",
  "22190": "Had we been placed in their circumstances should we have been any better than they?",
  "22191": "I know he'll say something, and then what shall I do?",
  "22192": "Was it not, my dear?",
  "22193": "Up to what age do you keep boys at your school then?",
  "22194": "Does the machinery stagger?",
  "22195": "But shall we say upon that account, that the wine is harmonious, or the music of a good flavour?",
  "22196": "The custom which is already established, or the laws which are proposed in that treatise?",
  "22197": "Did you get it from an unquestionable source?",
  "22198": "It's not going to be a ghost story?",
  "22199": "What had she to offer her beloved further than a life of retirement, of love, and of quiet happiness?",
  "22200": "A victory?",
  "22201": "It was understood that you wanted nothing for yourself, remember?",
  "22202": "What does that matter?",
  "22203": "Who can this knight be, with the fair damsel by his side?",
  "22204": "You mean that they were very clever and learned men, while you have grave doubts whether I am either?",
  "22205": "Was it ever known who this miserable fellow was?",
  "22206": "And your servants?",
  "22207": "So he is in prison then?",
  "22208": "Must my house or my roof be polluted with the scent of bears and bulls, when it is perfumed for great ladies?",
  "22209": "Well, and how did it end?",
  "22210": "And you reject this mark of my friendship?",
  "22211": "Then why, instead of tacking so frequently, do you not sail nearer the wind?",
  "22212": "What are you thumping the table for?",
  "22213": "Well, supposing I do love him?",
  "22214": "Quid feci?",
  "22215": "Is he alive?",
  "22216": "Does your majesty consent?",
  "22217": "How could I give her up, perhaps to stand her trial for murder?",
  "22218": "But what did my independence avail me, when I had bound myself in new fetters?",
  "22219": "What were these affrighted, shrieking voices calling?",
  "22220": "Did you ever see a man there who is accustomed to walk about with a ruler in his hand?",
  "22221": "Once more, then, what stops you?",
  "22222": "Was I a fool?",
  "22223": "How does he for the bells?",
  "22224": "Why is it that when you awake to the world of realities you nearly always feel, sometimes very vividly, that the vanished dream has carried with it some enigma which you have failed to solve?",
  "22225": "What is stronger?",
  "22226": "After all, what is there for us to fear in this house?",
  "22227": "But did it ever speak thus?",
  "22228": "How much is that?",
  "22229": "You will see him, if he comes up?",
  "22230": "But what was this portion of the globe which had been swallowed by cataclysms?",
  "22231": "What shall I do to him?",
  "22232": "Will you be as frank?",
  "22233": "Who among the people here could possibly think it worth his while to have his head done into marble?",
  "22234": "What shall we say to her?",
  "22235": "Why, what can you earn?",
  "22236": "Where will you meet?",
  "22237": "Today, almost for the first time, I set to work seriously, and what happened?",
  "22238": "You are there, are you, my friend?",
  "22239": "Who could hope ever to do anything to the satisfaction of the press?",
  "22240": "What's the matter naow?",
  "22241": "Now, about the honest hands?",
  "22242": "Would you like to be a gull?",
  "22243": "Why did they want out?",
  "22244": "What are the uses of decisions of courts?",
  "22245": "Oh, that was it?",
  "22246": "How can I be bribed?",
  "22247": "To him or to me?",
  "22248": "Why did you not dissuade him from it?",
  "22249": "Have you anything more to say?",
  "22250": "Any trade?",
  "22251": "What should I do with beans?",
  "22252": "I shall see you again, then, my lord?",
  "22253": "What then shall be done?",
  "22254": "What regulates them?",
  "22255": "Quite sure you can stand it?",
  "22256": "You would not give her pain?",
  "22257": "Tell us, shall we tell her now?",
  "22258": "What am I to call you?",
  "22259": "What do you mean by a struggle?",
  "22260": "How do you do?",
  "22261": "Where'd you get him ?",
  "22262": "Do you wish to take it, and what price will you pay if I let you have the whole of it?",
  "22263": "Is this man in town?",
  "22264": "Any mail?",
  "22265": "D'you ever try it?",
  "22266": "You're playing secretaire?",
  "22267": "And was it really possible and true, that her last darling was to be torn from her?",
  "22268": "What did he care that his aunts were only two ignorant old women?",
  "22269": "Can your name be RUMPELSTILTSKIN?",
  "22270": "Are you not going in, sir?",
  "22271": "Ah, what is that?",
  "22272": "Can you not trust me as a physician when I tell you so?",
  "22273": "Then what, exactly, is your plan for us?",
  "22274": "How did you do that?",
  "22275": "If so, what news?",
  "22276": "Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as his father did before him?",
  "22277": "But when and where had I seen them?",
  "22278": "Did any see it after?",
  "22279": "Lithia?",
  "22280": "Why should not the same sort of thing happen to me?",
  "22281": "Do you think so, really?",
  "22282": "And you would say the same sort of thing of the physician?",
  "22283": "But was it cast after all?",
  "22284": "Both lost?",
  "22285": "Is he so haughty?",
  "22286": "How then can I know, my dear?",
  "22287": "Will not?",
  "22288": "Will it not slap and pinch the envious dowager, that dares to reflect upon its own delicious?",
  "22289": "Can you still lie?",
  "22290": "You wished me to know the reasons?",
  "22291": "Or else, why did she not go out of the neighborhood, and get a situation where she was not known?",
  "22292": "Do you know that he holds terrestrial beings under his control?",
  "22293": "Has she been with you long?",
  "22294": "Or shall we say that they are in harmony with the apparent social will only, and really stand condemned?",
  "22295": "An explanation?",
  "22296": "What shall I be next?",
  "22297": "Where's the larder?",
  "22298": "Suppose a boy sauced you back when you told him to do something?",
  "22299": "Putting ourselves out of the question, what would you think of a girl who could engage herself to any man under such circumstances?",
  "22300": "As at present?",
  "22301": "What is your name?",
  "22302": "Whom have I hurt?",
  "22303": "Do you mean if you give in?",
  "22304": "Or have tasted the bag of the bee?",
  "22305": "For rich caparisons or trapping gay?",
  "22306": "Would you have it?",
  "22307": "What hotel did you manage?",
  "22308": "Where falls the balance of freedoms here?",
  "22309": "What sauce are they most dainty for?",
  "22310": "What will have gained by telling me all this?",
  "22311": "Is there not love in my heart, and constancy in my resolves?",
  "22312": "Were not the odds the other way?",
  "22313": "Did he keep any record of his cases?",
  "22314": "How often have I asked you not to take my things?",
  "22315": "Rank?",
  "22316": "How did it begin, when did it all come about?",
  "22317": "Where do you go?",
  "22318": "Well, what is to be done?",
  "22319": "Can you hear a mewing cat?",
  "22320": "Have you any opinion to offer, count?",
  "22321": "How long must we stay, do you think?",
  "22322": "What, gossip?",
  "22323": "What is the matter with it?",
  "22324": "But may I be allowed to place the mark for the second shooting?",
  "22325": "Have you ever noticed that all little children are blond?",
  "22326": "And that cavalier, that guest, that nobleman who arrived before she came?",
  "22327": "When am I to wear it?",
  "22328": "What made you go blind that sudden?",
  "22329": "How do you communicate?",
  "22330": "Have you enemies, then?",
  "22331": "Which of them will you test?",
  "22332": "Would you really do that?",
  "22333": "How is your old fellow?",
  "22334": "What bottles?",
  "22335": "Could we not keep it as a secret?",
  "22336": "But proportional to what?",
  "22337": "How did you come here?",
  "22338": "What would these insects eat, if we did not pass this way?",
  "22339": "Your advice, then?",
  "22340": "From the monastery?",
  "22341": "Are you not meditating?",
  "22342": "Would you compel such a state of affairs?",
  "22343": "Then how do you know?",
  "22344": "Where must I sleep, then?",
  "22345": "Supposing nobody should ever fetch me, how long would they consent to keep me there?",
  "22346": "And I?",
  "22347": "Are you alone, madam?",
  "22348": "Vulgar?",
  "22349": "Is not this change wrought in your minds a very important change?",
  "22350": "True?",
  "22351": "Shall I run on and stop them?",
  "22352": "What sort of road would that be?",
  "22353": "Is it your intention to go to an hotel, sir?",
  "22354": "Agree with what?",
  "22355": "Shall we go this high very long?",
  "22356": "Up?",
  "22357": "Was it this room?",
  "22358": "Anyone shot a fox?",
  "22359": "Then what business is it of yours?",
  "22360": "Dishonorable?",
  "22361": "What is the steamer's name?",
  "22362": "Do you often go to see it?",
  "22363": "How is it that the convicts are lying yonder dead, in the middle of the enclosure?",
  "22364": "But where should she go?",
  "22365": "You would be afraid to draw such an inference, would you not?",
  "22366": "Why, instead of a revolution, did they not content themselves with a reform?",
  "22367": "Why should you say that?",
  "22368": "And had it ready a nice little pinch of salt to put upon his tail?",
  "22369": "In what direction?",
  "22370": "And why was this?",
  "22371": "Now, did it strike your ladyship that she was like anybody?",
  "22372": "What do you mean to do with him?",
  "22373": "Not caring for their lives, is it?",
  "22374": "Will you promise to sit up with me to bear me company?",
  "22375": "What are you waiting for?",
  "22376": "What bell was that?",
  "22377": "And with you, governor?",
  "22378": "How came the words forth from her?",
  "22379": "Have I not always fought for your glory and interests?",
  "22380": "What, after all, was this blood of which she had taught herself to think so much?",
  "22381": "How do you do?",
  "22382": "But could it be otherwise?",
  "22383": "Must I compel men to render her fitting honor?",
  "22384": "For who gets wealth, that puts not from the shore?",
  "22385": "You feel, in other words, that she lies to you?",
  "22386": "Who has?",
  "22387": "And what crime has he committed?",
  "22388": "And whom are you waiting for?",
  "22389": "Why not say so?",
  "22390": "Nine, ten, eleven?",
  "22391": "And it was a fierce one?",
  "22392": "What is it they 'ad of you, sir?",
  "22393": "What have you been doing all this time, eh?",
  "22394": "Well, what does that lead up to?",
  "22395": "To whom did he call?",
  "22396": "And what are you?",
  "22397": "Could he be dead?",
  "22398": "Will you be willing to leave your present situation and try?",
  "22399": "What else can we do?",
  "22400": "Had he fallen during the attack on his rider, or was he straying in the bush, or had the convicts carried him off?",
  "22401": "How can he tell?",
  "22402": "Is it with me or for me that you are angry?",
  "22403": "Then how is it that I seem to understand them myself?",
  "22404": "What am I to DO with this?",
  "22405": "Where dwell we now?",
  "22406": "Why are they always anxious?",
  "22407": "What man has authority over himself?",
  "22408": "Who attends to them?",
  "22409": "And now, monseigneur, your answer to this proposition?",
  "22410": "And that caused his sister to refuse my brother?",
  "22411": "And you think she would be angry?",
  "22412": "What news have you?",
  "22413": "And have you not seen any of our other friends?",
  "22414": "All I'd done?",
  "22415": "If there are other causes of poverty than competition, does that prevent it from contributing its share?",
  "22416": "Why should I deceive you?",
  "22417": "What is it you fear?",
  "22418": "Faithful to whom?",
  "22419": "Ah, but if you got nothing to eat for ever so long?",
  "22420": "A horror?",
  "22421": "Do you think I was sorry?",
  "22422": "What's the matter?",
  "22423": "What about the chair?",
  "22424": "I suppose you will live with her now?",
  "22425": "Of what consequence is it to me, then, whether he be grateful or not?",
  "22426": "And why should the goblins mind you, pray?",
  "22427": "What villainy is this?",
  "22428": "Blewett?",
  "22429": "At home?",
  "22430": "Why, instead of transports that should have intoxicated me with their deliciousness, did I experience only fears and repugnance?",
  "22431": "Whats he?",
  "22432": "Well, he took that icon home with him for a few days and what did he do?",
  "22433": "Why, we must ask, do you trouble yourself so much about death?",
  "22434": "How does your lady, and how thrives your love?",
  "22435": "The greatest affection of which he is capable?",
  "22436": "Wife?",
  "22437": "A pox, is this your inns o' court breeding, not to know your friends and your relations, your elders, and your betters?",
  "22438": "And what's her name?",
  "22439": "What are those we know?",
  "22440": "Now do you want me to tell you who you are?",
  "22441": "Are you dissatisfied with my service, say?",
  "22442": "What is the object of slaying the spirit of vegetation at any time and above all in spring, when his services are most wanted?",
  "22443": "What is there in your son's face?",
  "22444": "Gone where?",
  "22445": "What length of course do you propose, dear heart?",
  "22446": "In what manner was I protected by him?",
  "22447": "What do you like best?",
  "22448": "Is it customary, I ask you, to help to tenderloin with one's fingers?",
  "22449": "Do you imagine that a person can die like this?",
  "22450": "Have you received the orders, and will you act upon them?",
  "22451": "How are they called who follow others in spite of them?",
  "22452": "Do you mean that you saw the murder?",
  "22453": "Was it not then a man like you and me, who first proposed this law, and by speaking persuaded the ancients?",
  "22454": "A political one, I suppose?",
  "22455": "But is there anything impossible for my d'Artagnan, the noble and loyal gentleman?",
  "22456": "What, I ask, in that case, would have been your conduct towards her?",
  "22457": "Do I turn to the right, or to the left hand?",
  "22458": "And suppose he falls?",
  "22459": "An expedition, sir?",
  "22460": "Is it not enough to set him thinking about it?",
  "22461": "What am I?",
  "22462": "Do you believe they're his own?",
  "22463": "And if I obtain this son, the object of my most cherished wishes, this son who is so necessary to me, who will take my place with him when I shall be absent?",
  "22464": "But you're not making a mistake?",
  "22465": "Was you a party in anything, ma'am?",
  "22466": "The knight they went to?",
  "22467": "Ask him what?",
  "22468": "Have I done something for the general interest?",
  "22469": "Have they legs and chops?",
  "22470": "What do you mean by this conduct?",
  "22471": "You're not a skater, I suppose?",
  "22472": "With him, aunt?",
  "22473": "Why does he not come to me?",
  "22474": "Among all the unfathomable precipices which surrounded him, which was his choice?",
  "22475": "Mais, monsieur, is it not time to begin to take more counsel of humanity, and less of your courage?",
  "22476": "How shall I requite you?",
  "22477": "Or when he chew'd it?",
  "22478": "How do I know, my dear, what young men do?",
  "22479": "How can I regret when what I did was inevitable?",
  "22480": "Can you have the heart to do it?",
  "22481": "Was not death infinitely more lovely and noble than such a life?",
  "22482": "When shall I set out?",
  "22483": "But what is this on the chest?",
  "22484": "Where's mother?",
  "22485": "Shall we turn?",
  "22486": "And now, do you wish to attend to your letters?",
  "22487": "May it be that, in some fashion or other, you want me?",
  "22488": "Do you know that the least garrison is of twenty companies of infantry?",
  "22489": "Have these confessed?",
  "22490": "Do you suppose I've asked him for an assurance?",
  "22491": "Are you sure it was my house she was coming to?",
  "22492": "And what are those hatfuls of pence and halfpence?",
  "22493": "What does the change mean?",
  "22494": "Monsieur le comte had an enemy there, then?",
  "22495": "Where are you off to?",
  "22496": "Why should this be so?",
  "22497": "His son?",
  "22498": "Well, and what next?",
  "22499": "What, you're on his track?",
  "22500": "Do you expect them today?",
  "22501": "A parson?",
  "22502": "Now, in what sign will the sun then be?",
  "22503": "Is that the way you love your neighbor as yourself?",
  "22504": "If they hear of this, will they let it pass?",
  "22505": "But where are you going,' that you talk about bidding goodbye?",
  "22506": "So you hate each other?",
  "22507": "Do you go home to dinner?",
  "22508": "Tell me how and why am I again a prisoner?",
  "22509": "You intend to look after me, then?",
  "22510": "Is not my husband here?",
  "22511": "And is she gone?",
  "22512": "If he had been your own boy, you would have put him to it, just the same, I suppose?",
  "22513": "We asked who they were?",
  "22514": "Is there not one among them who has seen it all, and who knows it to be true?",

  "25230": "Well, then, what makes you talk so wild?",
  "25231": "You have formed one, then?",
  "25232": "Will you please pardon my rudeness?",
  "25233": "My dear father, may I beg you to prepare your mind for what I am going to say?",
  "25234": "With what my father said just now?",
  "25235": "What did you think of that, sir?",
  "25236": "Would you like me to sit down for a minute or two?",
  "25237": "He is going with you, is he not?",
  "25238": "Of what disposition is he?",
  "25239": "What is it, then?",
  "25240": "Where did you really get them?",
  "25241": "What did you expect to gain by that?",
  "25242": "What heart can hold?",
  "25243": "Had he left her there to her fate in the lonely jungle?",
  "25244": "How do you do, all of you?",
  "25245": "Do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not talk as fast, and admire what she admires as rapturously as herself?",
  "25246": "Curious?",
  "25247": "Do you intend to sit up for me?",
  "25248": "But would the man acknowledge the relation?",
  "25249": "What are you doing now?",
  "25250": "Do you suppose that if I had made such a revelation to the king, I should have been alive now?",
  "25251": "He had a passion for pictures, and why should he not be able to paint as well as anybody else?",
  "25252": "Are you the gentleman who caused the accident?",
  "25253": "And the pay?",
  "25254": "Husband?",
  "25255": "I know what everyone would say is the right thing to do, but what do you say?",
  "25256": "What difference can it make to you?",
  "25257": "Was he a proprietor, or only a usufructuary?",
  "25258": "You have sold all your clothes?",
  "25259": "Surely you learnt that too?",
  "25260": "WHAT is it?",
  "25261": "But at this moment who knows if we may not be frightfully crushed between the two glassy surfaces?",
  "25262": "We must take care that that affair comes off all right, must we not?",
  "25263": "Why do you shake me like that?",
  "25264": "Now really should a cock be brought into a tragic play?",
  "25265": "Is his thread spun?",
  "25266": "Is it, then, impossible that, in the present condition of society, the workshop with its hierarchical organization, and machinery, instead of serving exclusively the interests of the least numerous, the least industrious, and the wealthiest class, should be employed for the benefit of all?",
  "25267": "Have not you an intimate friend?",
  "25268": "But how, and wherewith?",
  "25269": "That was a very different account of matters, was it not?",
  "25270": "What laws mean you?",
  "25271": "And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps?",
  "25272": "And on what will you sleep?",
  "25273": "That is what comes of your gospel of love, is it?",
  "25274": "Beautiful?",
  "25275": "Is it really possible that perfectly innocent people are kept here?",
  "25276": "You know the road?",
  "25277": "So if I say they're gone, you'll bear me witness, will you?",
  "25278": "Why should you not mention the sum?",
  "25279": "To what a devil, then, said he, serve so many paltry heaps and bundles of papers and copies which you give me?",
  "25280": "How did you get such small small legs?",
  "25281": "What is that news?",
  "25282": "His nieces accompany him, no doubt?",
  "25283": "Well, but whom are you attacking?",
  "25284": "Am I fool?",
  "25285": "What should hinder it?",
  "25286": "Is this true, my pulse?",
  "25287": "Have you given in your resignation, mademoiselle?",
  "25288": "How can you make yourself so inferior to me, as to show such a bad spirit?",
  "25289": "How can that be managed?",
  "25290": "When shall we be able to fish again?",
  "25291": "And what may your purpose be, most lofty lady?",
  "25292": "And when the better part of their products are consumed by others at the play, do you assure me that their families are not in want?",
  "25293": "Do I combine?",
  "25294": "What good was there in doing that?",
  "25295": "How can you do it seriously?",
  "25296": "Read?",
  "25297": "Was I absurd?",
  "25298": "Live like this?",
  "25299": "And if I could, what comfort to me?",
  "25300": "Aglaya, may I kiss YOUR prince?",
  "25301": "You mean to ask, I said, what will be our answer?",
  "25302": "You do not mean to inherit that infamous crotchet my brother has got into his head?",
  "25303": "Not a circus?",
  "25304": "Well, what have you got in your ear?",
  "25305": "What came of it?",
  "25306": "What makes it smell so funny?",
  "25307": "Which way are you going?",
  "25308": "Sure, little woman?",
  "25309": "The boy's, then?",
  "25310": "How d'you account for the general indifference, then?",
  "25311": "Why do you delay?",
  "25312": "Proud, eh?",
  "25313": "Since no man has aught of what he leaves, what is't to leave betimes?",
  "25314": "How is he?",
  "25315": "Were there not the brilliant particles of a halo in the air about his head?",
  "25316": "I therefore turned towards him with a stern countenance, and asked, who he called fool?",
  "25317": "You want me to swear?",
  "25318": "What you standing there for?",
  "25319": "Perhaps he is just as fond of suffering?",
  "25320": "What's the matter with you, old man?",
  "25321": "Married woman, I believe?",
  "25322": "Will you grant it to me?",
  "25323": "And the chin, with its dimples, as in health, might it not be hers?",
  "25324": "What will happen then?",
  "25325": "You mean that the thing is supernatural?",
  "25326": "And if I do speak to her, my lord, what then?",
  "25327": "Was it sufficient?",
  "25328": "Have you ever committed a sin?",
  "25329": "Presented to whom?",
  "25330": "Not for myself?",
  "25331": "Well, sir, will you go?",
  "25332": "Where did you go?",
  "25333": "What have we done?",
  "25334": "Do you jog hither, wagging your tails, to pant at my wine, and bepiss my barrel?",
  "25335": "What was going on in congress?",
  "25336": "Do you need a doctor?",
  "25337": "Why, oh why, have I betrayed myself?",
  "25338": "Had he any intellect, any thinking faculty, any consciousness of his own existence?",
  "25339": "Outspoken, is she?",
  "25340": "Is it honouring your husband to dishonour his business?",
  "25341": "To whom resort for relief?",
  "25342": "What must be done then?",
  "25343": "Are yours like that?",
  "25344": "And now, are you aware of one thing, monsieur?",
  "25345": "Is he on this farm?",
  "25346": "Now, did you not think so?",
  "25347": "What do men know about women's martyrdoms?",
  "25348": "What can be done?",
  "25349": "Is the room to be got ready upstairs?",
  "25350": "Will you be silent?",
  "25351": "But how could she?",
  "25352": "How shall I bring forth my wife?",
  "25353": "And the greater the interval which separates them from philosophy and reason, the more strange and illusive will be the pleasure?",
  "25354": "Does he also desire his archic man to be got up in a manner befitting royalty at a certain date?",
  "25355": "What can I do for you, my child?",
  "25356": "Well, the question is, what do you know about her?",
  "25357": "Suppose that she coulde pittie me, what then?",
  "25358": "Where is the child?",
  "25359": "What will you take?",
  "25360": "But who could have foreseen such an attention as this?",
  "25361": "Do you know I have entrusted him with our secret?",
  "25362": "Your sister is dead, then?",
  "25363": "What have I done to displease you?",
  "25364": "How begot, how nourished?",
  "25365": "What was the good of playing?",
  "25366": "Would she not be marvellously fair to look upon when in happy mood, seeing that she is so fair in her displeasure?",
  "25367": "Any youngsters?",
  "25368": "Can a man who possesses the slightest common sense be so unreasonable?",
  "25369": "Have you kept him in the cellar all this time?",
  "25370": "Did either of you boys touch it?",
  "25371": "Why has HE done nothing?",
  "25372": "Arrest you, my most faithful servant?",
  "25373": "Why did she betray the two of them so terribly, in embracing the glow of the evening?",
  "25374": "Are you a missionary?",
  "25375": "And in what condition?",
  "25376": "Did they have any repinings because of their course?",
  "25377": "You understand what I mean?",
  "25378": "You serve the cardinal?",
  "25379": "Where is his pistol?",
  "25380": "What DOES it call itself, I wonder?",
  "25381": "Was she not very much surprised?",
  "25382": "But what is that blockhead of a benevolent gentleman doing?",
  "25383": "And how do you know my heart is innocent?",
  "25384": "Shall I leave you?",
  "25385": "His blushes, his stumbles, his awkwardness, and the number of feet which he crushed as he went back to his place, who shall describe or calculate?",
  "25386": "So what does it matter?",
  "25387": "Or whether we should hold that cowardice makes no difference in the end, seeing that we all must share alike?",
  "25388": "You probably are not aware that I am here on a public kind of business, preposterous enough in itself, but which I have gone in for, and sworn by, and am supposed to be devoted to in quite a desperate manner?",
  "25389": "Now, do you find the business good, and the investment advantageous?",
  "25390": "And I dare say you sing a little, too?",
  "25391": "Was she normal?",
  "25392": "Are their heads off?",
  "25393": "This page or this page?",
  "25394": "What kind of a man is he?",
  "25395": "Will you tell me how that came about?",
  "25396": "For how can we know all the possible cases that may arise?",
  "25397": "Unfortunately, my lord, I am acquainted with nobody here but your grace, and if I should no longer find you, or if you should have forgotten me in your greatness?",
  "25398": "And why should she expect her brother to do that which her brother's guests would decline to do?",
  "25399": "What was there in the young girl's glance on this occasion?",
  "25400": "And then, why did he not at least answer it?",
  "25401": "But where are they, then?",
  "25402": "And then he can write back to my address, and I can smuggle the letter to you?",
  "25403": "Won what, ma'am?",
  "25404": "What dreadful thing drives her to say this, father, when it is such a pain to her?",
  "25405": "How long would the race endure if the parental instinct were wholly lacking?",
  "25406": "What then, my gentle sister?",
  "25407": "Which of the two will be the first to fall?",
  "25408": "Was this the right corner to turn?",
  "25409": "What are we?",
  "25410": "Who of you have done more?",
  "25411": "Get it?",
  "25412": "Whose hand's out?",
  "25413": "Alas, do you love nothing else in me?",
  "25414": "Shall we send the watch there?",
  "25415": "Would you mind my taking 'em out and looking at 'em for a minute, to see how they are made?",
  "25416": "Would you believe it?",
  "25417": "But you were married?",
  "25418": "Jespersen?",
  "25419": "Is papa alive?",
  "25420": "How is she?",
  "25421": "What do the overhanging warehouses make of that?",
  "25422": "Mathematics?",
  "25423": "And is not the creation of justice the institution of a natural order and government of one by another in the parts of the soul, and the creation of injustice the production of a state of things at variance with the natural order?",
  "25424": "But is it so?",
  "25425": "And with whom?",
  "25426": "What has it turned to, then?",
  "25427": "What would she say if she knew the truth?",
  "25428": "You loved your mother, then?",
  "25429": "I wonder what we both did that for?",
  "25430": "Damn you, sir, will you let me look inside that cab?",
  "25431": "Is there no voice in your mother's heart that forbids you to destroy your son's ideals?",
  "25432": "Been havin' a snooze, ole boy?",
  "25433": "Have you the tact?",
  "25434": "I could even go with you now?",
  "25435": "What shall you wear?",
  "25436": "How large is the garland?",
  "25437": "You are wrong, and what can you do better with your leisure hours?",
  "25438": "What did you do next?",
  "25439": "Well, where are you taking me, then?",
  "25440": "What was it he talked about?",
  "25441": "Will it hold water?",
  "25442": "Is this the missis?",
  "25443": "How shall the lots be drawn?",
  "25444": "Cannot make you understand WHAT?",
  "25445": "What'll they think of us?",
  "25446": "Who would have believed it?",
  "25447": "What means this woman?",
  "25448": "And turn all the people of the villages against us?",
  "25449": "What's the matter with the old man attending to him personally?",
  "25450": "Would you like supper?",
  "25451": "What do you say, monsieur?",
  "25452": "Do you want to know what it is in him?",
  "25453": "And why would you either?",
  "25454": "Will you wait here?",
  "25455": "Doctor seen them?",
  "25456": "Talk about men who deserve the name, can any man deserving the name waste his time in that effeminate way, when he sees half the world going to ruin for want of somebody to buckle to and teach them how to breast the misery they are born to?",
  "25457": "So there's nothing?",
  "25458": "And shall we eat bread?",
  "25459": "Ankle all right, eh?",
  "25460": "But who was she?",
  "25461": "Why should there often be so great a difference in the result of a reciprocal cross between the same two species?",
  "25462": "Is there any better or equal hope in the world?",
  "25463": "But I wanted to ask you directly what you think of me, of my life?",
  "25464": "Are you quite impervious to good advice?",
  "25465": "What is the matter with me?",
  "25466": "Did you see herself?",
  "25467": "Are we lovers?",
  "25468": "And how could you think o' going to the pond, and taking your sister where there was dirt?",
  "25469": "Against D'Artagnan?",
  "25470": "What lineage, what lineage?",
  "25471": "Did you post that letter yourself?",
  "25472": "But is it a kind heart?",
  "25473": "Shall we descend to the party at all?",
  "25474": "You are not playing with us?",
  "25475": "What other view could he have?",
  "25476": "And because you fear that it may be?",
  "25477": "Such a thing as a what?",
  "25478": "Are you trying to find out something bad about me?",
  "25479": "You lost your school and good income through her, did you not?",
  "25480": "Shall I take her to a coach?",
  "25481": "Was it his profile that was seen on the blind two nights before?",
  "25482": "When you became engaged to the young lady whom you have just mentioned, did you make a regular proposal to her family?",
  "25483": "Do all astronomers admit the existence of this satellite?",
  "25484": "What were we created for?",
  "25485": "I well know, that let you do as you will you will have in your favor the testimony of your conscience, but will this alone be sufficient, and is it permitted to neglect to a certain degree that which is necessary to acquire the approbation of others?",
  "25486": "Is there any drinkable wine in your tavern?",
  "25487": "To my lady's?",
  "25488": "Society?",
  "25489": "Was he the only passenger who came on board at that untimely hour?",
  "25490": "Did you take part in the campaign?",
  "25491": "Alone?",
  "25492": "Did you groan?",
  "25493": "Is he not a handsome man?",
  "25494": "Why pique all mortals, yet affect a name?",
  "25495": "Can you come directly?",
  "25496": "Have you never heard these respectable men, when they got home again, talking about the way in which immorality runs rampant abroad?",
  "25497": "Did I think she was alive?",
  "25498": "About the way in which we've treated that angel of a girl?",
  "25499": "By nothing?",
  "25500": "You watch while I sleep and you have come to bring me some news?",
  "25501": "And what object or consideration more pleasing than this can be presented to the human mind?",
  "25502": "Where did you go to school?",
  "25503": "Did you see the exquisite old lace she sent me?",
  "25504": "Which was first, thirst or drinking?",
  "25505": "What had become of him?",
  "25506": "Expectations?",
  "25507": "You are?",
  "25508": "Lan?",
  "25509": "Shall she giggle or grin?",
  "25510": "How can we not always think of her?",
  "25511": "YOU of importance to him in any way?",
  "25512": "Nor sold him anything, perhaps?",
  "25513": "Do you wish me to tell you it is good?",
  "25514": "Will you excuse me if I leave you for half an hour?",
  "25515": "What is to do?",
  "25516": "Who told you that?",
  "25517": "Does your majesty wish for your attendants at once?",
  "25518": "Will your business take long to state?",
  "25519": "Yes, dear boy?",
  "25520": "If we jest at them, what will our servants do?",
  "25521": "Have you tried him on the subject?",
  "25522": "Some of you gentlemen going to play for me this evening?",
  "25523": "May he, mother?",
  "25524": "Were?",
  "25525": "Why hush?",
  "25526": "Where are you off to now?",
  "25527": "Who nailed him?",
  "25528": "Have you no clue, can you suggest no clue, to their recovery?",
  "25529": "What may be your calling?",
  "25530": "What the value of those literary charms which are absolutely destroyed by their enjoyment?",
  "25531": "Has not that fire, that lies harmless and unseen in the sticks, the power to consume the whole country?",
  "25532": "You would often see him?",
  "25533": "How must I quit her?",
  "25534": "Can it be that it is all over?",
  "25535": "And, he will come presently?",
  "25536": "What did he say to you?",
  "25537": "Old frippery?",
  "25538": "Shall I tell him you're here?",
  "25539": "If his purpose were innocent, why did he not say so?",
  "25540": "Why did you keep me standing there in the cold?",
  "25541": "Now, the means of realizing these contradictory characteristics?",
  "25542": "What do you make of all this?",
  "25543": "What was the consequence?",
  "25544": "Have we not raised it?",
  "25545": "Do you think, then, that any harm can have happened to him?",
  "25546": "Have these birds come to contend for the double stadium prize?",
  "25547": "You think, then, that the case is hopeful?",
  "25548": "And if they are not, but these should be in the same situation with respect to their property which they are in other cities, what sort of a community will there be?",
  "25549": "Then why did you say you had business with the general?",
  "25550": "What was the extraordinary catastrophe that had transformed her?",
  "25551": "But what is that in the distance?",
  "25552": "Are we not here?",
  "25553": "Then how doth one know there was poison given at all?",
  "25554": "Why, bless you, child, what are you thinking of?",
  "25555": "It may well be asked, could such artistically shaded ornaments have been formed by means of sexual selection?",
  "25556": "What business has a pick and a shovel here?",
  "25557": "You'd have come here?",
  "25558": "After all, who among you will be in a position to guarantee payment if all the flocks die?",
  "25559": "So now, sir mechanic, the terms?",
  "25560": "Is the dear old lady dead?",
  "25561": "You have not put out your whole venture yet, have you?",
  "25562": "Suppose that some enemy of his old life had tracked him down and committed this crime, what possible reason could he have for taking his wedding ring?",
  "25563": "Why, what do you mean by this?",
  "25564": "Of what years is the knight, fair damsel?",
  "25565": "When is a man to be safe from such wit, if age and infirmity will not protect him?",
  "25566": "Have you seen the old lady?",
  "25567": "Even when I am alone with you, shall I never be allowed to address you otherwise than with that reverence and restrain which is due the queen?",
  "25568": "Permit me to ask, sir, from where do you know my name?",
  "25569": "What the anvil?",
  "25570": "What place will the moon occupy in the heavens at the moment of the projectile's departure?",
  "25571": "How was it that this delightful crisis did not secure our mutual felicity for the remainder of her life and mine?",
  "25572": "But what can they now do?",
  "25573": "Does it hurt your sense of the family dignity?",
  "25574": "What is it you mean?",
  "25575": "Shall I give him a pass for that object?",
  "25576": "Bunburyist?",
  "25577": "Are you satisfied then that the quality which makes such men and such states is justice, or do you hope to discover some other?",
  "25578": "But what do you want them for, for decoration, or to send away, or what?",
  "25579": "The wind?",
  "25580": "But you will be left alone?",
  "25581": "You have solved it already?",

  "25592": "What do you wish me to say?",
  "25593": "Can he take her in?",
  "25594": "Will you not, for me, take that place?",
  "25595": "On the highroad?",
  "25596": "Why handsome?",
  "25597": "And where does she live?",
  "25598": "And which way may you be travelling?",
  "25599": "Do you say she makes a good living out of stories like this?",
  "25600": "Are you fond of the theatre?",
  "25601": "But is it not I that speed him hence, my liege?",
  "25602": "Was it so terrible?",
  "25603": "Oh, was he there?",
  "25604": "What do I mean, more than I know?",
  "25605": "And did he answer forcibly or feebly?",
  "25606": "Well, what did you see?",
  "25607": "What can we do to expedite matters?",
  "25608": "At what time was he coming?",
  "25609": "How's your project of painting the hall coming on?",
  "25610": "Hair?",

  "26010": "Who is to throw a stone?",
  "26011": "How so, my pet?",
  "26012": "Ambulance or train?",
  "26013": "Dare I ask you to explain?",
  "26014": "Only what are we to talk about?",
  "26015": "Again, if there be nothing real in the universe, what is it that causes unreal objects to appear?",
  "26016": "What do you want of me?",
  "26017": "Not the old business?",
  "26018": "Somebody was coming?",
  "26019": "Mad one, what have I said?",
  "26020": "Do you know I am dissatisfied with your younger son?",
  "26021": "In pain, where?",
  "26022": "Doth it long for knowledge as the lion for his food?",
  "26023": "But what other ways?",
  "26024": "So I come and take, and what do I do?",
  "26025": "But why have you no packing bag?",
  "26026": "He does your bidding?",
  "26027": "Had he not better take the big umbrella?",
  "26028": "But of what?",
  "26029": "Shall you be there, sir?",
  "26030": "Mamma, are you asleep?",
  "26031": "Have I not, sir?",
  "26032": "And so many children poor?",
  "26033": "At least, what?",
  "26034": "Are not the roofs and the lintels wet?",
  "26035": "At what time did he go?",
  "26036": "Then how could they tear me pitilessly from all that was dear to me, and lock me up in prison like a wild animal?",
  "26037": "And who's to make him?",
  "26038": "How did the boat strike when she went in?",
  "26039": "How hight she?",
  "26040": "You understand what I mean?",
  "26041": "But is not war an art?",
  "26042": "Postponed?",
  "26043": "She is, is she?",
  "26044": "Who is fit for it?",
  "26045": "Do you not as a rule think women below your notice as companions?",
  "26046": "Will you tell me where the BRITANNIA was wrecked?",
  "26047": "What chance had they against one who, if she had a mind, could put by out of her income twice as much as they, poor women, could spend?",
  "26048": "What mede is aye to live in comfort?",
  "26049": "Who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads?",
  "26050": "Who's over me?",
  "26051": "Why, in the devil's name, have they served me thus?",
  "26052": "You know her husband, of course?",
  "26053": "Is it possible that the meaning of life was not disclosed to him before he died?",
  "26054": "Are you brutes?",
  "26055": "In fact, what is to be expected in any country where taste and cultivation of mind do not supply the place of youthful beauty and animal spirits?",
  "26056": "Think it'll ride?",
  "26057": "What'll the other people in the house say to my being here?",
  "26058": "But was it all there was of life?",
  "26059": "What private box?",
  "26060": "Nor written?",
  "26061": "Would I not give all that I have of strength at one blow if I could open his eyes to see as I see but for one minute?",
  "26062": "Consequently, a capital blade?",
  "26063": "And break it out?",
  "26064": "He has the horse, then?",
  "26065": "You're not sorry you've come, are you?",
  "26066": "The entrance cannot be easy?",
  "26067": "Why do I not give it?",
  "26068": "And does that hinder you from letting me know the second reason?",
  "26069": "Clarence?",
  "26070": "Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy?",
  "26071": "Why did you play us such a trick, damn you?",
  "26072": "What is his object?",
  "26073": "What would happen next?",
  "26074": "Who might do this but the women?",
  "26075": "Do you know that?",
  "26076": "Why, my dear friend, do I not see you?",
  "26077": "But, in truth, what is the good of these disguises?",
  "26078": "Will that restore it to sight?",
  "26079": "Where is this person?",
  "26080": "What can a man spend his ha'pence on here in this country hole?",
  "26081": "Catharine, did I do wrong?",
  "26082": "How much are you out of pocket?",
  "26083": "What has become of her?",
  "26084": "And if difficulties were necessary to increase the splendor of the effort, what could be harder for a restless, ambitious girl than to give up her own hopes, plans, and desires, and cheerfully live for others?",
  "26085": "Could we advertise, then, asking for information from wharfingers?",
  "26086": "Does this infinite awaken in us the idea of essence, while we can attribute to ourselves only the idea of existence?",
  "26087": "We will say ten o'clock then?",
  "26088": "To its honors, to its flowers, to its golden aspirations?",
  "26089": "But always smelling those leather books, what can be expected?",
  "26090": "Is it not time for a change?",
  "26091": "What did happen to me?",
  "26092": "Do you think now that I shall tell you what motive he had had in starting out?",
  "26093": "You perhaps think I should have expected this refusal?",
  "26094": "And your cargo?",
  "26095": "Can you not see that if when I had sight, and fame, and all heart could desire, I could not win her love, what she might feel for me now, in my helpless blindness, could be but pity?",
  "26096": "What's the game?",
  "26097": "Not related to her, sir?",
  "26098": "But, they say, is that true right, social right, fraternal right?",
  "26099": "Do you know, sir, that that man did all this?",
  "26100": "Did he give you anything else?",
  "26101": "Why should he die, for he felt that he could not live, under such a weight of obloquy?",
  "26102": "It's he then who has told you?",
  "26103": "Is that all?",
  "26104": "Took?",
  "26105": "How much do you know?",
  "26106": "Out of your own pocket?",
  "26107": "Why was it none would give it, then?",
  "26108": "Shall they be banished from the district, or from the whole land?",
  "26109": "Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?",
  "26110": "Did I abuse you?",
  "26111": "You who see your betters bearing up under this shame every day, meekly suffering under the slights of fortune, gentle and unpitied, poor, and rather despised for their poverty, do you ever step down from your prosperity and wash the feet of these poor wearied beggars?",
  "26112": "And who wants to be acquainted with you?",
  "26113": "What can you do?",
  "26114": "Are you in love with the cows?",
  "26115": "Not to her uncle?",
  "26116": "Why should it not, at a certain depth, attain an impassable limit, instead of rising to such a point as to fuse the most infusible metals?",
  "26117": "But why have you done it at all?",
  "26118": "And what does this groom do?",
  "26119": "Sun in your eyes and his face in the shadow?",
  "26120": "Would she hear of his being slapped and beat by drummers demnebly?",
  "26121": "Are we at the pole?",
  "26122": "Do you hear, do you hear what he says?",
  "26123": "Was he again to be disturbed?",
  "26124": "Was she going to act and keep house?",
  "26125": "But why does he have this idea of a horse?",
  "26126": "Was that his work or was it possibly the doing of someone who was bent upon counteracting his schemes?",
  "26127": "Two minutes wrong?",
  "26128": "Do you not guess, monsieur?",
  "26129": "Where's your horse?",
  "26130": "Will you give me something to eat and a bed?",
  "26131": "What would they do to assist them?",
  "26132": "Let us have the land?",
  "26133": "Does he ever pay the rent for you?",
  "26134": "Might I ask you, sir, to pacify my mind?",
  "26135": "It is difficult to rise above the jungle standards and reason by the light of civilized ways, is it not, my friend?",
  "26136": "What about your government and all this treatment?",
  "26137": "What the devil are you doing?",
  "26138": "What help is to be hoped for, what consolation, what solace?",
  "26139": "Or, may we not owe their visit to the dead colt?",
  "26140": "Where shall we search for him?",
  "26141": "Why should you keep such things from me?",
  "26142": "Physiology not an experimental science?",
  "26143": "What about the dough?",
  "26144": "Can she have loved my brother so little as to be able to forget him so soon?",
  "26145": "What thing?",
  "26146": "Do you suppose she takes you for a symbol?",
  "26147": "Has she run away because we are come?",
  "26148": "Shall I tell her or not?",
  "26149": "But then, why had he permitted that man to leave him alive?",
  "26150": "What's that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for?",
  "26151": "On which of these actions did he reflect with the most pleasure, when he was summoned by the angel of death?",
  "26152": "What was in there?",
  "26153": "But tell me, what is she?",
  "26154": "Is he ungrateful to no one else?",
  "26155": "Aye, how do you know he is?",
  "26156": "Does our friend eke out his modest income with a crossing?",
  "26157": "The stag spoke?",
  "26158": "What are the dangers which menace us?",
  "26159": "Monsieur does not then renounce his excursion for this evening?",
  "26160": "You imagine, I dare say, that you invented something quite new?",
  "26161": "Is there anything in what I say, or am I talking to no purpose?",
  "26162": "Was he already with the queen?",
  "26163": "What is the matter, that with all his ill usage of me, I cannot hate him?",
  "26164": "Now, I beseech you, do tell me, have you ever attended to their pairing and breeding?",
  "26165": "Oh, what have I done to be blessed with such friends?",
  "26166": "Two one pound notes, or friends?",
  "26167": "Why indeed should they maintain a watch?",
  "26168": "What was I to do?",
  "26169": "So will you abandon your plan?",
  "26170": "What can I say that will enable you to understand the depth of my sorrow?",
  "26171": "Did she still love him?",
  "26172": "What you 'bout?",
  "26173": "And of the pleasures of love, and all other pleasures, the same holds good?",
  "26174": "What does she want?",
  "26175": "Will it be safe to leave you there alone?",
  "26176": "In your room?",
  "26177": "Can dignity of mind exist with such trivial cares?",
  "26178": "Are they dead, ma'am?",
  "26179": "And what shall we have in lieu of it?",
  "26180": "It is a lovely night, and why should we not prolong our ride a little?",
  "26181": "You will not come?",
  "26182": "For arrears of pay?",
  "26183": "Copperfield, my dear fellow, how do you do?",
  "26184": "And is the city which is under a tyrant rich or poor?",
  "26185": "Was it not too clear that, let the matter go how it would, there was no happiness in store for her?",
  "26186": "Would you kindly send one of your constables for two buckets of water?",
  "26187": "But what is there, then, above the sun?",
  "26188": "Why are they not given up to the church, as they ought to be?",
  "26189": "But you, d'Artagnan, what is the matter with you, and what has happened to you personally?",
  "26190": "To conceal his name?",
  "26191": "Is it at some set season?",
  "26192": "Did she know anything of his life upon the sea?",
  "26193": "Where is so awful a responsibility laid upon them?",
  "26194": "Well, my boy, what's there to prevent you?",
  "26195": "What more natural, after this, than the dream which came to him?",
  "26196": "If vices be genuine and virtue a deception, as you think, why do you call the inventors of that deceiving art sages?",
  "26197": "Has the law any eyes to witness your grief?",
  "26198": "How can I be vain when I know I'm homely?",
  "26199": "The little girl?",
  "26200": "Kicked on that occasion for cheating at dice?",
  "26201": "What proofs do you require?",
  "26202": "On business, eh?",
  "26203": "Why, what's happened?",
  "26204": "Not hurt you, did I?",
  "26205": "Was it the time the sandy cat walked round the balustrade?",
  "26206": "What insults, girl?",
  "26207": "And how does any one know whether he will stay days, months, or years?",
  "26208": "Well, how are you going to get out of that?",
  "26209": "Have you your stethoscope?",
  "26210": "Well, where can we find it?",
  "26211": "Was it mere social effect, fulfilment of ambition in the social world, in the community of mankind?",
  "26212": "How about this ad of yours?",
  "26213": "Do you still suppose that I am a boy ignorant of my own mind, and mistaking the impulses of my own soul?",
  "26214": "Must we then not be married, in order to sanctify the union of our hearts?",
  "26215": "Ay, but will you promise to come?",
  "26216": "What did you write about?",
  "26217": "Perhaps you are laughing again?",
  "26218": "So you think that these people have already quitted the island?",
  "26219": "What's a lad with good friends doing as loblolly boy?",
  "26220": "Who can tell if that mind, when the touchstone is applied to it, will not be found of a mean and vulgar character?",
  "26221": "But what time's breakfast, sir?",
  "26222": "Did you signal us, lording?",
  "26223": "Where was you raised?",
  "26224": "May I read it?",
  "26225": "Where is the treasure?",
  "26226": "You know?",
  "26227": "Snatch at it?",
  "26228": "Would not this mode of proceeding be preferable to that of causing letters to be opened by any one who may be employed, and replying to them by a circular to which it is only necessary to attach a date?",
  "26229": "Well, what say you to a friend that would take this bitter bargain off your hands?",
  "26230": "Just step into this corner a moment, will you?",
  "26231": "What will you do, dear?",
  "26232": "Who shall prevent him?",
  "26233": "Is it a profession?",
  "26234": "You admit you owe him three pounds then for a month's board?",
  "26235": "Have I not found her friendless, and cold, and comfortless?",
  "26236": "Is he learned?",
  "26237": "Ay, where are they?",
  "26238": "Who is there?",
  "26239": "Why should he feel joy at turning back?",
  "26240": "Must I really?",
  "26241": "And shall I not do as the first man?",
  "26242": "Was I not a fool, when I refused to look at or speak to him?",
  "26243": "And may we say that this has been proven?",
  "26244": "Does she cook the dinner?",
  "26245": "How do you come to know it?",
  "26246": "She was confined at your house, was she not?",
  "26247": "Do you know who I am?",
  "26248": "Very well what did I say to you?",
  "26249": "Father, have you any objection to my going away?",
  "26250": "And you are afraid I shall be unhappy?",
  "26251": "To reign in my place and stead?",
  "26252": "I suppose?",
  "26253": "Does the day look clear again?",
  "26254": "What if I were to think a little about others?",
  "26255": "Why on earth did you shut yourself in?",
  "26256": "Do you really suppose?",
  "26257": "Why one to come and one to go?",
  "26258": "Is not that the bishop?",
  "26259": "Why will you ruin yourself, your family, and nation?",
  "26260": "Why such a hard sentence?",
  "26261": "Will he not fancy that the shadows which he formerly saw are truer than the objects which are now shown to him?",
  "26262": "May I go and see her?",
  "26263": "Where did you go this morning?",
  "26264": "So very soon?",
  "26265": "Well, sir, in writing against property, have I done more than quote the language of history?",
  "26266": "I unhappy?",
  "26267": "But how did he come by his death?",
  "26268": "Can you believe it?",
  "26269": "Do you think that was done last night?",
  "26270": "Which is the way to the chapel?",
  "26271": "May we, then, be permitted to speak of the past in the present?",
  "26272": "What victim?",
  "26273": "Do we not own the country?",
  "26274": "Raoul, did you ever see anybody hung?",
  "26275": "May I be permitted a word or two of advice?",
  "26276": "If not, where's he gone?",
  "26277": "What would they think of me?",
  "26278": "What says the abbe?",
  "26279": "Might it not be that she would calculate that an interview would thus be possible?",
  "26280": "Why linger to add to the number of the victims of our merciless enemies?",
  "26281": "What is bad?",
  "26282": "And what now?",
  "26283": "Was he actually in hiding from the police?",
  "26284": "Shall he in the meantime risk the character and interest of the nation in the hands of men to whom he can not give his confidence?",
  "26285": "In the tremendous breaking forth of a whole people, in which all degrees, tempers and characters are confounded, delivering themselves, by a miracle of exertion, from the destruction meditated against them, is it to be expected that nothing will happen?",
  "26286": "What's the meaning of this?",
  "26287": "But how was it possible to effect this?",
  "26288": "Will you let me?",
  "26289": "And look you, lord, times are not ill, so wherefore should I risk a change of days?",
  "26290": "That certainly seems a satisfactory explanation, does it not?",
  "26291": "You have my birth certificate?",
  "26292": "Is it an odd speech, papa?",
  "26293": "Had you not observed it before?",
  "26294": "Who would attend him when he was sick?",
  "26295": "Till to your very doors the war be brought?",
  "26296": "A sleeping draught?",
  "26297": "Philip?",
  "26298": "But they may come any moment, for you left word that I awaited them?",
  "26299": "Why, indeed?",
  "26300": "Shall you?",
  "26301": "But how came the hand to discompose you so much, if it was only a letter of business?",
  "26302": "Why did this sudden conviction of a religious woman cast a terrible doubt in my mind?",
  "26303": "Was that then he or an inhuman thing moved by a lower soul?",
  "26304": "And the power which the eye possesses is a sort of effluence which is dispensed from the sun?",
  "26305": "What was one to think or feel?",
  "26306": "Can you tell the position of the rooms?",
  "26307": "To defend ourselves against attack?",
  "26308": "The child?",
  "26309": "When shall I have the answer, monseigneur?",
  "26310": "But where does it stay?",
  "26311": "D'you like that?",
  "26312": "You know that to be so?",
  "26313": "Was it possible to render any aid to the dying man?",
  "26314": "Widowed mother, perhaps?",
  "26315": "Has she mentioned me lately?",
  "26316": "And what your sorrow?",
  "26317": "Did you speak, my own?",
  "26318": "Is it only a voice?",
  "26319": "Why wonder about this?",
  "26320": "Did he not advertise?",
  "26321": "In what manner?",
  "26322": "What would they do if they found me?",
  "26323": "But how can I pay them?",
  "26324": "How was this done?",
  "26325": "Away from me?",
  "26326": "And, if so, surely there is good material in you?",
  "26327": "What was the matter with you, baron?",
  "26328": "May I have the honour?",
  "26329": "Will you come into the garden?",
  "26330": "Will it satisfy them, in the future, if we have nothing to do with invasions and insurrections?",
  "26331": "But what are we to do with her when we have caught her?",
  "26332": "And what do you say of lovers of wine?",
  "26333": "Where now the splendid future of her poor duped children?",
  "26334": "So that is what you wanted the money for?",
  "26335": "Would you like to take her place?",
  "26336": "Was it in the papers yet?",
  "26337": "What had become of that fair fellowship, so closely bound together by public and private ties, so resplendent with every talent and accomplishment?",
  "26338": "Who lives to the left there?",
  "26339": "Where shall we have tea?",
  "26340": "Would she ever die?",
  "26341": "And had the leather interior lasted with the felt cap through seven centuries?",
  "26342": "But why should anyone take it in order to keep it in his house?",
  "26343": "What will happen now?",
  "26344": "Next, how can the posting be accomplished in these mountainous parts?",
  "26345": "Does your soul belong to him now?",
  "26346": "How is man to know?",
  "26347": "And what can I do for you, esteemed prince?",
  "26348": "But this letter in which he recommends you to me?",
  "26349": "What are bulbs?",
  "26350": "Would you like to ferry me over?",
  "26351": "I hope your respected father is well, sir?",
  "26352": "And what, my lord, has been my fault?",
  "26353": "Then what is the illness itself?",
  "26354": "Is that what you've been so funny about this evening?",
  "26355": "But you are half asleep, are you not?",
  "26356": "Of whom?",
  "26357": "And suppose I were to die?",
  "26358": "I wonder where they do go, by the by?",
  "26359": "Is the well where you got this water near at hand?",
  "26360": "And does your honor know the four men who undertook to rescue him?",
  "26361": "Did you still hear the knocking?",
  "26362": "But to what place was I to go?",
  "26363": "Would you work for four and a half a week?",
  "26364": "You have a child?",
  "26365": "Can any man think it would be wise to leave such posts in a situation to be at any instant seized by one or the other of two neighboring and formidable powers?",
  "26366": "How shall we punish him for such a speech?",
  "26367": "What can be plainer than that the webbed feet of ducks and geese are formed for swimming?",
  "26368": "The sun?",
  "26369": "Diana?",
  "26370": "But who was she?",
  "26371": "Have you been in others?",
  "26372": "But what shall we say of the glee with which the effigy is often carried out, of the sticks and stones with which it is assailed, and the taunts and curses which are hurled at it?",
  "26373": "How died he?",
  "26374": "She asked, if she should call me again?",
  "26375": "Have you been there long?",
  "26376": "Do I interrupt?",
  "26377": "But it is quite understood, is it not?",
  "26378": "Will you carry him?",
  "26379": "Neither will he ever break faith where there have been oaths or agreements?",
  "26380": "If he comes back again, father?",
  "26381": "But who can tell what had happened?",
  "26382": "What then, I shall be asked, prevents these things from taking place with such regularity and precision?",
  "26383": "Who is the lady?",
  "26384": "And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?",
  "26385": "Is it not a just retribution?",
  "26386": "And where are the bodies?",
  "26387": "What do you say to coffee?",
  "26388": "Then we are friends?",
  "26389": "What are you thinking of, D'Artagnan?",

  "26769": "Perhaps you would prefer being alone?",
  "26770": "Where were his flatterers now?",
  "26771": "Must I move on, sir?",
  "26772": "And he deceived you, and then deserted?",

  "27021": "Does any one believe that, if the merchants interested in the course of the navigable way had been charged with the enterprise at their own risk and peril, they would have had to do their work twice?",
  "27022": "There are whalers in these quarters, then?",
  "27023": "You went out with them, of course?",
  "27024": "Do they measure the king, too?",
  "27025": "And twisted it into thread?",
  "27026": "Where was he sitting?",
  "27027": "A setback?",
  "27028": "You will call me sister, will you not?",
  "27029": "Had she heard aright?",

  "27031": "Whither was it going?",
  "27032": "And, suppose I should wish to be married to the man that I love?",
  "27033": "Did these men arrive here voluntarily or involuntarily, by disembarking on the shore or by being wrecked?",
  "27034": "Are you going too?",
  "27035": "Did you think there was nothing but evil at the bottom of them?",
  "27036": "What would she do?",
  "27037": "This vexes you?",
  "27038": "And what do I see here, monsieur?",
  "27039": "Will he not think that the pleasure of riches is vulgar, while the pleasure of learning, if it brings no distinction, is all smoke and nonsense to him?",
  "27040": "Why should she disappoint those expectations because of the imperious demands of a very highly excited boy?",
  "27041": "Good heavens, why should I?",

  "27074": "But who, then, is this assassin, this murderer?",
  "27075": "Why did he urge me so little about the princess?",
  "27076": "What is the meaning of their eternal care and worry?",
  "27077": "Were his eyes deceiving him?",
  "27078": "Why this ridiculous mania for affirming that every thing has been said, which means that we know all about mental and moral science?",
  "27079": "And you spoke to him?",
  "27080": "What's the trouble?",
  "27081": "Give who?",
  "27082": "Anything else?",
  "27083": "Are you mad enough to leave this house?",
  "27084": "How long have you been engaged in the practice of medicine?",
  "27085": "What of it?",
  "27086": "Then it will be our duty to select, if we can, natures which are fitted for the task of guarding the city?",
  "27087": "Why not end my misery now rather than drag out a few more wretched days in this dark pit?",
  "27088": "Why did you lend an ear to the temptings of friends?",
  "27089": "What do you understand of the affair?",
  "27090": "Are we to pass the night in the king's room?",
  "27091": "Not about money, I hope?",
  "27092": "Extraordinary, did you say?",
  "27093": "Why should you interfere?",
  "27094": "Gania, what are you standing there for?",
  "27095": "But why, of all others, choose these?",
  "27096": "Ever so little did you say, gossip?",
  "27097": "Are you in need of soothsaying?",
  "27098": "An incendiary, then?",
  "27099": "To come at call?",
  "27100": "Have I time?",
  "27101": "Do they live?",
  "27102": "And this is all?",
  "27103": "You mean that you want to go away from me?",
  "27104": "Now, my friends, can the country be saved upon that basis?",
  "27105": "What, billing so sweetly?",
  "27106": "Well, then what of it?",
  "27107": "What would my islanders say when they heard their governor was going, strolling about on the winds?",
  "27108": "But, guardian, may we not hope that a little experience will teach him what a false and wretched thing it is?",
  "27109": "Have you told them to bring the horse?",
  "27110": "Will you then believe, you dear, foolish enthusiast, that I love you, and that it is no demon that rests here in your arms and swears that she loves nothing but you?",
  "27111": "What are we doing?",
  "27112": "Well, did you see them fly?",
  "27113": "What are you up to?",
  "27114": "And that's why you trust him, eh?",
  "27115": "And what does he think of it?",
  "27116": "What sort of an education could they have got in the country?",
  "27117": "How do you go back?",
  "27118": "How old is your sister?",
  "27119": "Were they in the tent?",
  "27120": "Some poaching case, no doubt?",
  "27121": "What is that for?",
  "27122": "On what occasion?",
  "27123": "But were there no reasons why I should avoid you?",
  "27124": "Would it not be of some assistance, if we knew of what substance it is composed?",
  "27125": "Had she only been guilty of silence as to his fate?",
  "27126": "Shall I take it down for you?",
  "27127": "What about, papa?",
  "27128": "But I suppose there is no fire?",
  "27129": "Why should she talk of her own unhappiness?",
  "27130": "Where do you suppose him to be?",
  "27131": "And what means are ours, of attaining the truth?",
  "27132": "You mean?",
  "27133": "Please, sir, be this note for you?",
  "27134": "Surely I can never have seriously written such a silly motto as that?",
  "27135": "Have you made up your mind when you shall be there yourself?",
  "27136": "Need it go on?",
  "27137": "How can you love a girl, and yet so humiliate her as to throw her over for the sake of another woman, before the very eyes of that other woman, when you have already made her a formal proposal of marriage?",
  "27138": "What was going on in that mind which was so young and yet already so impenetrable?",
  "27139": "What shall become of this?",
  "27140": "But how was this to be done, when he had no revenue, often not means enough for necessary expenses?",
  "27141": "What steps have you taken?",
  "27142": "And now?",
  "27143": "What was that they said?",
  "27144": "Why should any one murder a man in so clumsy a fashion as by hanging him?",

  "27146": "Is it really true, what every one says, that you cut off one of the ogre's arms?",
  "27147": "Should he knock as of old?",
  "27148": "Nothing about the silver calabash he spat into?",
  "27149": "But what availeth it?",
  "27150": "Where then lay the spots of commonness?",
  "27151": "Who will volunteer for the job?",
  "27152": "How do we stand in point of time, constable, eh?",
  "27153": "Did I not promise?",
  "27154": "Well, who said it was?",
  "27155": "I suppose your people all do this?",
  "27156": "Did anyone send you, sir?",
  "27157": "What then do you know?",
  "27158": "But where could a dog have come from?",

  "27165": "Where am I?",
  "27166": "Did he before?",
  "27167": "Do you want her?",
  "27168": "To what, then, do we owe these blessings?",
  "27169": "In other words, how, from the nature of universal human reason, do those questions arise which pure reason proposes to itself, and which it is impelled by its own feeling of need to answer as well as it can?",

  "27554": "If it should break forth into a storm, who can insure us that in its progress a part of its fury would not be spent upon us?",
  "27555": "How can we prevent that?",
  "27556": "Might I come some other day?",
  "27557": "Go for a soldier, do you mean?",
  "27558": "But what did the mere reckoning of years matter when he felt as young in heart as he had been twenty years ago?",
  "27559": "How could a garden be shut up?",
  "27560": "Your wife or your daughter?",
  "27561": "So that you could see he knew what was between the two wretches?",
  "27562": "But who is there in the world that can boast of having fathomed or understood the wavering mind and unstable nature of a woman?",
  "27563": "Did you ever behold streets so insufferably narrow, or houses so miraculously tall?",
  "27564": "How can they know?",
  "27565": "Is it to make me a captain?",
  "27566": "What IS the matter with it?",
  "27567": "Would that surprise you?",
  "27568": "But would he come?",
  "27569": "How do you know I was praying, sir?",
  "27570": "Who looks after the sick here?",
  "27571": "Who can make him out?",
  "27572": "To whom do I address it?",
  "27573": "But where was mine?",
  "27574": "Am I, indeed, so happy?",
  "27575": "Hemlock, do you mean?",
  "27576": "How could you possibly know that?",
  "27577": "Why so insensible to my uncle's interests?",
  "27578": "And the possibility has been acknowledged?",
  "27579": "Your ruin?",
  "27580": "Do you mean in point of reward?",
  "27581": "But how long have you been here that you are ignorant of all this?",
  "27582": "Would there ever come to him a time of freedom?",
  "27583": "Will you bear, therefore, will you bear to see your sanctuary trampled on?",
  "27584": "Even if the squire should afterwards hear of his having been there, what would it matter?",
  "27585": "She said I was prudent and virtuous?",
  "27586": "How are you to get away from here?",
  "27587": "You are confident that the thief came in a cab?",
  "27588": "What could he want?",
  "27589": "Why not have kept hold of it with both hands, with both knees, when it was about to flee from her?",
  "27590": "But to what does all this lead?",
  "27591": "How do the bass chords run?",
  "27592": "Does it mean that the risk is not so great as we who have seen the abnormal and not the normal side of taking risks with icebergs might suppose?",
  "27593": "Shall I send the servant to direct you?",
  "27594": "How much is the whole?",
  "27595": "And who instructed you, eh?",
  "27596": "Do you know anything of his history?",
  "27597": "Was she ever as pretty as my mother is now?",
  "27598": "But the puzzle is, who are the teachers?",
  "27599": "How could you be cruel to me?",
  "27600": "But well carried out, eh?",
  "27601": "How did you fare?",
  "27602": "Who does it come from?",
  "27603": "What happened within her?",
  "27604": "Whom had he to consult but himself now?",
  "27605": "What differences from terrestrial conditions will ensue?",
  "27606": "Are they going to sacrifice the children who seek the learning, or the sick who need medical care, or the families who dwell in squalor now brightened by the hope of home?",
  "27607": "What stable?",
  "27608": "Do I look ugly?",
  "27609": "Can you lift me into that tree and put a rifle in my hands?",
  "27610": "Shall I tell you what you were thinking to yourself just then?",
  "27611": "But what can I have to relate to you?",
  "27612": "Why is that woman always out of the way when she is most wanted?",
  "27613": "What right had they to make me suffer like that?",
  "27614": "How long do you suppose this sea to be?",
  "27615": "Do you desire it as ardently as you say?",
  "27616": "If nature suddenly should give that beast a tail, would he not be prouder of it than all the other foxes in the wood?",
  "27617": "Who could have said so the evening before?",
  "27618": "Very good?",
  "27619": "Are you likely to be more humane to me than others were yesterday?",
  "27620": "Was it my imagination that there was an undertone of fear rather than of hope in the question?",
  "27621": "What could have caused it?",
  "27622": "Is he a scholar, or a soldier?",
  "27623": "And to confer upon me the favour of your distinguished recommendation?",
  "27624": "How can he keep him?",
  "27625": "Surely you have felt that it is so?",
  "27626": "Could there be a development of knowledge in the absence of curiosity?",
  "27627": "Do the old fellows bother you?",
  "27628": "If what?",
  "27629": "And how have you been getting on?",
  "27630": "But you, sir?",
  "27631": "Did you see?",
  "27632": "Who is your favorite author?",
  "27633": "You think this old monkey in here knows what you say?",
  "27634": "What would you gain by it?",
  "27635": "You've been picking the flowers, hey?",
  "27636": "But are you so sure, so very sure of her?",
  "27637": "If I get your grandpa to apologize for the shaking, will you give up running away?",
  "27638": "Who's here?",
  "27639": "Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring?",
  "27640": "And it is asked by what authority this bold and radical innovation was undertaken?",
  "27641": "I asked him upon this if he ever disputed with his wife?",
  "27642": "Sirrah, who gave you a commission to lie in my lordship?",
  "27643": "How can I tell?",
  "27644": "How could I let him?",
  "27645": "What hand and brain went ever pair'd?",
  "27646": "Why did you write me such a horrid letter, you naughty boy?",
  "27647": "Or can I ever see one?",
  "27648": "Quite?",
  "27649": "What is she vexed with him about?",
  "27650": "Has it not happened to all of us, in certain supreme conjunctures, to stop our ears in order that we may not hear the reply, after we have asked a question?",
  "27651": "To do that, my joy?",
  "27652": "And later?",
  "27653": "But what language is it?",
  "27654": "Lucy dear, do you know why I tell you all this?",
  "27655": "How did they come to love each other?",
  "27656": "But what are you going to do to repay us for the past?",
  "27657": "Got any views on the subject?",
  "27658": "Of the duke?",
  "27659": "What means all this?",
  "27660": "Will you stay here if the enemy occupies the place?",
  "27661": "For how shall I be able, said he, to rule over others, that have not full power and command of myself?",
  "27662": "Go?",
  "27663": "Have I deserved to be called an elderly person?",
  "27664": "Is it because we are calculated to walk?",
  "27665": "Why ask about the next but one?",
  "27666": "Can we have the butler in for a moment?",
  "27667": "What prodigies be these?",
  "27668": "Who suffers by his ill whims?",
  "27669": "Do you hear the news?",
  "27670": "Is there any one who understands human and political virtue?",
  "27671": "What did she see there?",
  "27672": "The postilion?",
  "27673": "What ancient nation, as the same author asks, can be named that was originally monogamous?",
  "27674": "What can I do to do myself justice upon her?",
  "27675": "Your letter is like you, and what could I say of it that would be higher praise than that?",
  "27676": "You would not be cruel to me?",
  "27677": "Is everything here purple?",
  "27678": "Do you think we did well in using the adder's fat?",
  "27679": "When to be made payable?",
  "27680": "Is she married, my dear?",
  "27681": "Anyone about?",
  "27682": "Why this religious depreciation of labor, if it is true, as economic science already shows, that labor is the father of love and the organ of happiness?",
  "27683": "Oriental?",
  "27684": "Are we going to see the court?",
  "27685": "So why should he have made such a sacrifice?",
  "27686": "Hrut asked him what news?",
  "27687": "What accursed philosophy stands in your way?",
  "27688": "And have you been up there?",
  "27689": "But why do you give them me?",
  "27690": "What was his own inward definitive response to the unbribable interrogatory of fatality?",
  "27691": "Is not the land more faithful?",
  "27692": "I wonder if it is mine?",
  "27693": "If you demand WHY?",
  "27694": "Allow me to ask you, prince, since you cherish those intentions, how you consider that you will provide for my happiness?",
  "27695": "Who among them can do it so well?",
  "27696": "And upon what will the tax be levied?",
  "27697": "If wandering beyond hearing of her peculiar call, they are overtaken by a storm or attacked by an enemy, what can they do but in the one case droop and die, and in the other submit to be torn to pieces?",
  "27698": "What would the gain be to me if I were healed and you not?",
  "27699": "Or are we all insane?",
  "27700": "The moonlight than the fog of frost?",
  "27701": "Where is he hiding?",
  "27702": "Why did not you say so then?",
  "27703": "What do you mean, sir?",
  "27704": "Would you like me to help you tonight?",
  "27705": "Why how you talk?",
  "27706": "Was there any lady of the house?",
  "27707": "For from what impression coued this idea be derived?",
  "27708": "Where did you get that onion?",
  "27709": "And shall we arrive there?",
  "27710": "Is it about my husband?",
  "27711": "Does anybody bring up other people's children?",
  "27712": "What's the use of our wasting another year?",
  "27713": "Stolen diamonds?",
  "27714": "Mary, what do you think is going to happen?",
  "27715": "Well, what have you to say to me?",
  "27716": "Have you a cabriolet that you can let me have?",
  "27717": "What is it to you what he signs?",
  "27718": "And where did you run into her, my good girl?",
  "27719": "Have there not been governments which were blind leaders of the blind?",
  "27720": "Who's me?",
  "27721": "Gave him?",
  "27722": "You are an extraordinary woman, why should you follow the ordinary course, the ordinary life?",
  "27723": "What may I hope for?",
  "27724": "But why are these two lords such enemies?",
  "27725": "How many women in these days would think of doing that?",
  "27726": "How is your hand?",
  "27727": "What ails you?",
  "27728": "Is it not strange that people can laugh, amuse themselves, be joyful under that eternal certainty of death?",
  "27729": "Yours or mine?",
  "27730": "And may we not say confidently of man also, that he who is likely to be gentle to his friends and acquaintances, must by nature be a lover of wisdom and knowledge?",
  "27731": "What was the reason of this disappointment?",
  "27732": "Where am I?",
  "27733": "Where did they both come from?",
  "27734": "I, where?",
  "27735": "What sort of knowledge is there which would draw the soul from becoming to being?",
  "27736": "Burn the poor devils who are only condemned to be hung?",
  "27737": "What ought we to do?",
  "27738": "Yes, but I?",
  "27739": "What do you want, monsieur?",
  "27740": "How, then, could I make a wry face over one bitter morsel?",
  "27741": "Where are we going then?",
  "27742": "Where is he then?",
  "27743": "Might I not, taking up the definitions of casuists, have clearly shown the cause of their contradictions and uncertainties, and supplied, at the same time, the inadequacies of their conclusions?",
  "27744": "Even supposing one parts from her, so as not to break up one's family life, still, can one help feeling for her, setting her on her feet, softening her lot?",
  "27745": "What, YOU fly?",
  "27746": "How could he be expected to remember her?",
  "27747": "Need we think of that since we are to save the king?",
  "27748": "Is that what you expected to get from me?",
  "27749": "And what became of the bust?",
  "27750": "What have I done?",
  "27751": "Has the picture been engraved, miss?",
  "27752": "Shall we not be glad and rejoice in the happiness of our children?",
  "27753": "And if I refuse?",
  "27754": "And where was the place?",
  "27755": "Will you join me now, and we'll walk this last mile together?",
  "27756": "Should he render the obscurity on his brow and the cloud upon theirs still more dense?",
  "27757": "What were them packages we carr'd there at the beginning o' the week?",
  "27758": "What's the matter with your big friend that he was so terribly in earnest?",
  "27759": "And when did you find time to do them?",
  "27760": "Perhaps he has dribbled away too?",
  "27761": "Did it bite, hey?",
  "27762": "Are you going away immediately?",
  "27763": "Yes, sir?",
  "27764": "What did you say, then?",
  "27765": "What whale?",
  "27766": "What have you to gain by a strike?",
  "27767": "Or shall the penalty be a fine, and imprisonment until the fine is paid?",
  "27768": "Was that a rat I saw skulking into his hole?",
  "27769": "Or do we entrust to the males the entire and exclusive care of the flocks, while we leave the females at home, under the idea that the bearing and suckling their puppies is labour enough for them?",
  "27770": "What is this body of mine worth?",
  "27771": "To eat?",
  "27772": "What was the hidden significance of the perfumed envelope?",
  "27773": "Do you hear how this moujik of a fellow goes on bargaining for your bride?",
  "27774": "What does he want the bits for?",
  "27775": "Do it NOW?",
  "27776": "Why is the benefit of this pretended law confined to a few and denied to the mass of laborers?",
  "27777": "Warn me?",
  "27778": "May I ask were you born like that, or is it the result of an accident?",
  "27779": "Polluted by crimes and torn by the bitterest remorse, where can I find rest but in death?",
  "27780": "Is such a thing as an emerald made worse than it was, if it is not praised?",
  "27781": "Lily, cannot you say yes?",
  "27782": "Then why did he travel under an assumed name?",
  "27783": "To put me on my guard?",
  "27784": "Will you at last tell us where you were on that night?",
  "27785": "Would you like to see a camp of bandits in repose?",
  "27786": "Suppose it should not be done enough?",
  "27787": "Possibly we may speak together in another tongue?",
  "27788": "Will you promise me your deepest sympathy, if I tell you?",
  "27789": "But what else can you do?",
  "27790": "Do you see a slab laid up against the wall?",
  "27791": "What do you intend to do?",
  "27792": "And you have brought him?",
  "27793": "Did any of them know their way about in the office?",
  "27794": "Cozen me?",
  "27795": "Who of them is the best cock o' the game?",
  "27796": "Have I not seen this lion a prey to such grief on my behalf that he was on the point just now of thrusting my sword through his breast?",
  "27797": "The young lady's cousin, then?",
  "27798": "What should I have done?",
  "27799": "What do you mean, monsieur?",
  "27800": "How's your house?",
  "27801": "Will we have to stay out in the woods all night?",
  "27802": "What are his necessities, and what does he require?",
  "27803": "Then he is not jealous?",
  "27804": "You have a longboat?",
  "27805": "Where, I wonder?",
  "27806": "But what does that prove?",
  "27807": "Watching me, I suppose?",
  "27808": "Where will it move to?",
  "27809": "When did he lose his wife?",
  "27810": "How did you get such thin thin thighs?",
  "27811": "Go down to the fiery pit itself, in order to keep out this frost?",
  "27812": "But who are those others?",
  "27813": "But after that?",
  "27814": "But do you really WANT sensuality?",
  "27815": "Will you just turn this nab of heath, and walk into my house?",
  "27816": "Would you do it?",
  "27817": "Now since the fancy finds the same facility in passing from the lesser to the greater, as from remote to contiguous, why does not this easy transition of ideas assist the transition of passions in the former case, as well as in the latter?",
  "27818": "What had he said wrong?",
  "27819": "Have they been used in the removal of the relic from downstairs?",
  "27820": "By road, by rail, by water?",
  "27821": "And what about the other fortnight?",
  "27822": "Am I the only woman that did?",
  "27823": "And may I read it now?",
  "27824": "What does he ask?",
  "27825": "Is he made of tin, or stuffed?",
  "27826": "And therefore that I'm always a fool?",
  "27827": "What makes you glad?",
  "27828": "What makes you think such a thing?",
  "27829": "Do the men work?",
  "27830": "Do you deny my right to feel so much interest in you as to desire to know whether you are about to married?",
  "27831": "But who could he possibly have been?",
  "27832": "For the cats, my lord?",
  "27833": "Quite away?",
  "27834": "Are you brave enough to follow me, monsieur knight errant?",
  "27835": "Who else?",
  "27836": "How do we know that the creation of worlds is not determined by the fall of grains of sand?",
  "27837": "The trouble of the king becomes the trouble of the subject, for how shall we live if judgement is withheld, or if faulty decisions are promulgated?",
  "27838": "Could she not float in the river?",
  "27839": "With what people takes he this task in hand?",
  "27840": "Taken the goose?",
  "27841": "Is your vessel a swift one?",
  "27842": "Or if it be possible to imagine, that such errors are the sources of all immorality?",
  "27843": "Is it not so, gentlemen?",
  "27844": "You forsake me at the hour of my life when it seems to me I most deserve a friend's loyalty?",
  "27845": "You cannot see?",
  "27846": "What is wrong with her?",
  "27847": "Do you see it?",
  "27848": "What will posterity say?",
  "27849": "Can we deny that a warrior should have a knowledge of arithmetic?",
  "27850": "What have you to fear?",
  "27851": "Did you doubt it?",
  "27852": "In the country?",
  "27853": "Who was it they were talking about now?",
  "27854": "Do you find yourself badly lodged, sister?",
  "27855": "Where are you traveling from?",
  "27856": "I wonder what it was that first induced you to sit?",
  "27857": "Monsieur parle francais?",
  "27858": "Rather young, eh?",
  "27859": "When shall we have a meet?",
  "27860": "Who's this in the bush?",
  "27861": "But do you know how?",
  "27862": "Then you have no great love for your own species?",
  "27863": "Who that witnessed her calm, brave fortitude, could have suspected how immensely the weight of the visible cross was aggravated by that of the invisible?",
  "27864": "How long is he going to stand with his back against that door?",
  "27865": "What is to happen?",
  "27866": "The better, or the worse?",
  "27867": "How shall they bury him?",
  "27868": "But how can we find where this house lies?",
  "27869": "What was it he held in his hand?",
  "27870": "Has life no sourness, drawn so near its end?",
  "27871": "Have we trembled?",
  "27872": "Afraid?",
  "27873": "And what will become of all these creatures?",
  "27874": "Is she not?",
  "27875": "Finally, what can we do to move from the present pause toward enduring peace?",
  "27876": "What wait we for?",
  "27877": "Should I not torture her?",
  "27878": "What was it he had hinted at in that suggestion of his?",
  "27879": "But it may rain OUTSIDE?",
  "27880": "Had we risen to the surface of the waves?",
  "27881": "And why today, rather than yesterday or tomorrow?",
  "27882": "Will you wear it on the morrow?",
  "27883": "What consequence can the reverses of fortune be to you?",
  "27884": "But no doubt you are a good deal changed since then, sir?",
  "27885": "How are you, sir?",
  "27886": "Have you no idea whatever?",
  "27887": "May we see?",
  "27888": "Did you listen?",
  "27889": "How can she?",
  "27890": "Has he a lady with him?",
  "27891": "For mercy's sake, who saw it?",
  "27892": "How can a man wish that, and yet love on?",
  "27893": "I hope you care to live?",
  "27894": "Much money to be gained?",
  "27895": "Then, sir, I am patiently to submit to your refusal?",
  "27896": "Have you pricked your finger?",
  "27897": "Will have?",
  "27898": "Countersigned by you?",
  "27899": "Well, said I, but whither am I to be carried next?",
  "27900": "With what object?",
  "27901": "How was he in fording?",
  "27902": "Will my love for you and the children cease with my life?",
  "27903": "Whither away?",
  "27904": "Never heard your father and mother talk about him?",
  "27905": "Why do I come?",
  "27906": "Did you see any of these pretty things, my dear?",
  "27907": "What ought I to have done?",
  "27908": "And what do you take your own to be?",
  "27909": "Is she under thirty, the woman who holds a boy in her thrall?",
  "27910": "I want a warm coat and a mackintosh, but with so many to feed how can a man get it?",
  "27911": "How could anyone explain this strange crime otherwise?",
  "27912": "What might be your name?",
  "27913": "How did you avoid it?",
  "27914": "What is there that could not be done by such a craftsman?",
  "27915": "And he positively is going?",
  "27916": "Copperfull?",
  "27917": "Can any one seriously deliberate in the case?",
  "27918": "We'll go over by the eleven o'clock, shall we?",
  "27919": "What is the worst of success?",
  "27920": "But where will you get such tiny monkeys?",
  "27921": "And how if he fail?",
  "27922": "Or was it not truly the report of another and a distant gun in answer to their own?",
  "27923": "Is it not the want of flesh meat?",
  "27924": "Upon a dead subject, I suppose?",
  "27925": "Do you dare to suspect me?",
  "27926": "And what may it be?",
  "27927": "Are you going to be a guardsman or a diplomatist?",
  "27928": "What will you do with such as disagree?",
  "27929": "Tell me, then, and tell me truly, what land and country is this?",
  "27930": "Why have our jurists and our theologians failed, with all their shrewdness, to check the extension of the right of increase?",
  "27931": "And where is beauty's fault in that?",
  "27932": "What have men called good?",
  "27933": "What the devil are you doing there?",
  "27934": "What annoyance?",
  "27935": "Why did he always offer a glass of something to everyone who came?",
  "27936": "Your fortune was staked on him?",
  "27937": "What for, mother?",
  "27938": "How can we know that three pleasures counterbalance a pain?",

  "28540": "Then how about our position?",
  "28541": "And will he not?",
  "28542": "What recompense can we present?",
  "28543": "The principle is the same, I think?",
  "28544": "What happens in so many cases?",

  "28547": "And as to her face, could it inspire nothing but passion?",
  "28548": "What was it then, and how had it affected his fate?",
  "28549": "Manager to a diamond merchant, or some such thing, is he not?",
  "28550": "And he does forgive?",
  "28551": "When all that failed, he boldly accosted him, and asked him, whether he did not remember him?",
  "28552": "Or, whither he should go?",
  "28553": "But we shall see you at the musicale this afternoon, shall we not?",
  "28554": "Should possibilities be worse to bear than certainties?",

  "28568": "When you came in at the gate and asked the watchman the way here, had you any one with you?",
  "28569": "Where did your instructions come from?",
  "28570": "Why, then, monseigneur does not know?",
  "28571": "But, gentlemen, why are you getting angry again?",
  "28572": "And now it is you who have brought them together again?",
  "28573": "Was there not a spirit in him which, silent as it was, burned on him like the fires of perdition?",
  "28574": "Hurt you?",
  "28575": "What visions, they asked, could one but read them, must lie behind the quiet, dreaming eyes of that inscrutable face?",
  "28576": "What resources could they expect to find upon that scene of desolation?",
  "28577": "May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?",
  "28578": "Are you reconciled?",
  "28579": "Are you nothing?",
  "28580": "But what could have frightened the creatures so, and driven them from their haunts, when they ought to have been quietly sleeping?",
  "28581": "Or would you include the mixed?",
  "28582": "Was it a screw or thrust?",
  "28583": "Ah, then, is THAT what you've stayed over for?",
  "28584": "Do you know that he's the honestest and faithfullest fellow that ever lived, and that he has an irreproachable good name?",
  "28585": "What do you think of it, now?",
  "28586": "Why not?",
  "28587": "Always busy at what?",
  "28588": "How is it possible for him to be attained to?",
  "28589": "Is it finished?",
  "28590": "What do you mean?",
  "28591": "Do you hesitate?",
  "28592": "Is there any one in the lobby?",
  "28593": "I like the baron, but what better gifts can marriage bestow, than I already possess?",
  "28594": "Is not that saying illustrated by this?",
  "28595": "What's he?",
  "28596": "Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?",
  "28597": "Silver?",
  "28598": "Are we going to continue this pace all night?",
  "28599": "Can I be so lucky as to find what everybody is seeking for?",
  "28600": "Face?",
  "28601": "What else have you done?",
  "28602": "It stung you up a bit when I spoke of your game leg, young fellow?",
  "28603": "Sire, will you allow me to speak frankly as befits a loyal soldier?",
  "28604": "Then why speak to me about it?",
  "28605": "What the devil do I do?",
  "28606": "Who would ever know?",
  "28607": "Was I very gleeful, settled, content, during the hours I passed in yonder bare, humble schoolroom this morning and afternoon?",
  "28608": "Who will shrive the poor wretch, if you have come away from him?",
  "28609": "Why should I do so?",
  "28610": "And then she could not help remembering that he had passed some time with her under like circumstances, so why should there be any unfitness in the fact?",
  "28611": "Is there no mistake?",
  "28612": "Must he not have the qualities of a sage?",
  "28613": "Why is the sycophant thus added to the hypocrite, and the man who pretends to govern, sunk into the humble and submissive memorialist?",
  "28614": "Well, have we attained our end there also?",
  "28615": "From the dry rock who bade the waters flow?",
  "28616": "Do you observe that we were not far wrong in our guess that temperance was a sort of harmony?",
  "28617": "Whatever her sins, they were not sins of intention, but of inadvertence, and why should she have been punished so persistently?",
  "28618": "What was the bargain?",
  "28619": "And his dog also?",
  "28620": "Must I call you a liar as well as a thief?",
  "28621": "Why did you bring me here?",
  "28622": "If he could not speak, how was she to do so?",
  "28623": "And he will accomplish the trip?",
  "28624": "Is he mad?",
  "28625": "What is she there for?",
  "28626": "YOU insulted ME?",
  "28627": "And now, matey, did that doctor say how long I was to lie here in this old berth?",

  "28633": "The boy's name?",
  "28634": "Why do you want to start on that again?",
  "28635": "And you yourself, what do you think about it?",
  "28636": "Why do you say I do not regard it?",
  "28637": "Must we, then, give up to despair?",
  "28638": "But where the devil are you?",
  "28639": "Living?",
  "28640": "Do you know what you have said?",
  "28641": "Well, and what has she been doing?",
  "28642": "Shall we not spend our immortal life together?",
  "28643": "Would this political deterrence prove acceptable to allies and to our own public?",
  "28644": "Should not all they be called mercenary who are always seeking consolations?",

  "28655": "Would you not say that he is entirely concerned with the soul and not with the body?",
  "28656": "Have we not?",
  "28657": "What does she think herself about him?",
  "28658": "Do you hate me so much as all that?",
  "28659": "Is not this to be rich?",
  "28660": "Should you like to retire at once?",

  "28673": "And they will go in three days now?",
  "28674": "But what good could he have done if he had?",
  "28675": "And what probability was there that a mere drudge would be able to manage a large and stormy assembly, abounding with able and experienced men?",
  "28676": "Gave him leave?",
  "28677": "You have, then, overheard our conversation?",
  "28678": "Will they sacrifice opportunity for the distressed, the beauty of our land, the hope of our poor?",
  "28679": "Suicide?",
  "28680": "Esther, will you forgive me?",
  "28681": "Was this not preventing any inquiry, and, at the same time, assuming a higher ground through this pretended fascination exercised over a man who must have been of warlike nature and accustomed to receive homage?",
  "28682": "For what end are her fair complexities, her changes of soil, her sinuous coast?",
  "28683": "What was to be done with them?",
  "28684": "What must I know?",
  "28685": "Is it good?",
  "28686": "Would you four stand up for a moment?",
  "28687": "Is it not on this order of release?",
  "28688": "And, still further, I am tempted to inquire what has become of the indigent scholars, the sons of the masses of the people whose daily labour just suffices to meet their daily wants, for whose benefit these rich foundations were largely, if not mainly, instituted?",
  "28689": "There is nothing in my house for you, do you hear?",
  "28690": "On what ground shall we persuade the contented egoist, who has but a handful of commonplace desires and finds it possible to satisfy most of them, that it is better to call into being a multitude of wants many of which will probably remain unrealized?",

  "28695": "Not sick, are you?",
  "28696": "But what if I were mistaken?",
  "28697": "Then do you yourself know?",
  "28698": "Why should you, of all people, be so passionate about it?",

  "29110": "Because I lie with a queen?",
  "29111": "Can I break their chains?",
  "29112": "How could she strive to bear a load that was so manifestly too heavy for her shoulders?",
  "29113": "Upon two thrones?",
  "29114": "He saw that something sublime was being accomplished in her soul, but what?",
  "29115": "Burden's folks?",
  "29116": "What, do we arrest our friends?",
  "29117": "Are they relations?",
  "29118": "And this beautiful and accomplished lady, she is not yet married?",
  "29119": "When do you say?",
  "29120": "Did you touch it?",
  "29121": "Will it ultimately reach the clear surface of my consciousness, this memory, this old, dead moment which the magnetism of an identical moment has travelled so far to importune, to disturb, to raise up out of the very depths of my being?",
  "29122": "Dandyism?",
  "29123": "What is a fray?",
  "29124": "Why is the crane so thin?",
  "29125": "Is it very important news?",
  "29126": "What on earth can she have gone there for?",
  "29127": "You'll do it, then?",
  "29128": "But what are these shocking screams?",
  "29129": "And the new system is one of your own invention?",
  "29130": "What does the king wish?",
  "29131": "What have they taken a baby in there for?",
  "29132": "My wife came to your house to reclaim her father?",
  "29133": "Why, how can you be dissatisfied with yourself if you are happy?",
  "29134": "But what do you mean by the highest of all knowledge?",
  "29135": "Do you remember what I saw?",
  "29136": "Why should I do that?",
  "29137": "Do you think you are fit to touch the bed of a man like me?",
  "29138": "No, but what is it, my dear?",
  "29139": "But when a man is drawn in two opposite directions, to and from the same object, this, as we affirm, necessarily implies two distinct principles in him?",
  "29140": "Was he not of noble birth?",
  "29141": "What's the use of canting now?",
  "29142": "Is it possible that you can see anything more than the merest chance in this meeting?",
  "29143": "Who's given us the slip now, do you think?",
  "29144": "You too?",
  "29145": "What circumstances?",
  "29146": "What DO you mean?",
  "29147": "And can it be that so happy a marvel has come to pass?",
  "29148": "Do you suppose it may go all right?",
  "29149": "When he's just born?",
  "29150": "Sirrah, where is my dog?",
  "29151": "You will be ready, sir?",
  "29152": "Have you your papers?",
  "29153": "How many houses?",
  "29154": "Were you in the room at the moment of his fatal seizure?",
  "29155": "Whither should he go?",
  "29156": "Or, what encouragement is there left to continue throwing good money after bad?",
  "29157": "Yes, how do you know it?",
  "29158": "May not this affectation of a false stoicism come from the same source as his recognition of the right of property?",
  "29159": "Why does not he go about his business?",
  "29160": "Said I not from the first it would be so?",
  "29161": "And who conceals them?",
  "29162": "Her lord it was whom I wounded mortally, and yet do I think I can be reconciled with her?",
  "29163": "Do you wish it known that you are interested about him, monsieur le comte?",
  "29164": "What qualities are there for which a man gets so speedy a return of applause, as those of bodily superiority, activity, and valour?",
  "29165": "Can it be we are going into battle?",
  "29166": "Can anything be done for you?",
  "29167": "Could you put me up tonight?",
  "29168": "Has not life other motives as strong?",
  "29169": "Then, worn out by deceit, treasons, infidelity, and the whole body of terrestrial misery, what does he find at the end of his career?",
  "29170": "Have I got all my traps?",
  "29171": "What did you do then?",
  "29172": "Was she dreaming?",
  "29173": "And particularly, whether they were ever admitted as members in the lower senate?",
  "29174": "Is he alive?",
  "29175": "And what was that, shipmates?",
  "29176": "Did the archdeacon wink, or did he not?",
  "29177": "Of what tongue, from what land were they?",
  "29178": "Your profession?",
  "29179": "He is still with you, I presume?",
  "29180": "Now, where are you going?",
  "29181": "How can we trust one who lives by the fluctuating favour of a distant authority?",
  "29182": "Whither goes she?",
  "29183": "What had happened to him?",
  "29184": "Are we friends?",
  "29185": "Electric?",
  "29186": "What does your brother say?",
  "29187": "What is this water, and where does it run?",
  "29188": "But, unscrew your navel, and what's the consequence?",
  "29189": "You often think you know me as I really am?",
  "29190": "But where am I wandering to?",
  "29191": "Was the other one lost by a whale?",
  "29192": "Why do you doubt your senses?",
  "29193": "One on each side of the ship?",
  "29194": "And is the record yours?",
  "29195": "Where could they be?",
  "29196": "Ah, now, what do you take me for?",
  "29197": "Can not it?",
  "29198": "Are these to be or not to be the strains which the children will hear repeated in their ears by all the citizens about those who are intimated to them to be their parents and the rest of their kinsfolk?",
  "29199": "For a hunt and a gallop, eh?",
  "29200": "And why are you permitted to go at large, unwatched?",
  "29201": "Anne, what want you here?",
  "29202": "Dravot used to make us laugh in the evenings when all the people was cooking their dinners—cooking their dinners, and … what did they do then?",
  "29203": "But what is he, I dinno?",
  "29204": "Is this quite certain?",
  "29205": "Where is he hiding?",
  "29206": "You dare to talk of your child?",
  "29207": "Can you not give me that information here?",
  "29208": "How say you, cousin?",
  "29209": "But what is it now?",
  "29210": "Are you sure?",
  "29211": "Le mot d'ordre?",
  "29212": "Why, that way?",
  "29213": "Have you put the lunch in?",
  "29214": "How then had he been able to explain, and in such language, the number of things that he could not have said so well before?",
  "29215": "What, is it right?",
  "29216": "Well, and how do you do?",
  "29217": "And the king?",
  "29218": "Am I not already in the grave?",
  "29219": "What shall I say to him first?",
  "29220": "What promise?",
  "29221": "And will he talk thus of affairs in presence of two strangers?",
  "29222": "What would the issue of it be?",
  "29223": "And why?",
  "29224": "How long you been this way?",
  "29225": "But all this entails expense, and upon whom is this to fall?",
  "29226": "Is this the origin of the zodiacal light?",
  "29227": "Is the fracture recent?",
  "29228": "Now are you ready to tell, boys?",
  "29229": "I suppose you have a garage there?",
  "29230": "That would meet the situation?",
  "29231": "Was this well done, young gentleman?",
  "29232": "If he could see the projectile through the glass of his gigantic telescope, what would he think?",
  "29233": "Meaning what?",
  "29234": "What's the exact state of affairs as regards myself?",
  "29235": "Or you have overheard the servants talk?",
  "29236": "Tom, what's the matter with you?",
  "29237": "Who brought it into this room, then?",
  "29238": "But who do you suppose our other friend is?",
  "29239": "Why do you wish you were dead?",
  "29240": "Why, what do I keep you for?",
  "29241": "And JIM?",
  "29242": "But, pray, what pretty neat damsel was with you?",
  "29243": "Just like one of the peasants, all day long?",
  "29244": "Little boy, what do you want?",
  "29245": "Where is there any water?",
  "29246": "How could I say such cruel things to her?",
  "29247": "I have caught you, have I?",
  "29248": "Yes, that's it, she means to elope with him, but what am I to do?",
  "29249": "Leave tonight?",
  "29250": "What would you throw out?",
  "29251": "What did the king say to you?",
  "29252": "Should I be getting your teas ready, while you do that?",
  "29253": "Do you know me?",
  "29254": "What vessel is that?",
  "29255": "Or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected?",
  "29256": "Shall we swear to each other, one day?",
  "29257": "Why are we there ?",
  "29258": "Not even me?",
  "29259": "Ah, ha, that's it, is it?",
  "29260": "There is a great improvement here, ma'am?",
  "29261": "Why does he want them?",
  "29262": "Broughton, just get a policeman, will you?",
  "29263": "Would he succeed in coming face to face with the girl he was seeking?",
  "29264": "Whatever do you mean?",
  "29265": "And what went wrong?",
  "29266": "Yes honey, but what's the matter with you, precious?",
  "29267": "Will not the capture of one army after another satisfy him, must all become prisoners?",
  "29268": "How will they get at it?",
  "29269": "Expenses paid, and a moderate screw?",
  "29270": "Was she expecting a visitor?",
  "29271": "Thinks I, what does it mean?",
  "29272": "Were's it gorn?",
  "29273": "How's that?",
  "29274": "Now you, sir, will you answer me or not?",
  "29275": "I take back the ring, after it has passed through the hands of that infamous creature?",
  "29276": "And what did he find?",
  "29277": "Is it sure promised?",
  "29278": "What is the trial for, when he is not here and will never return?",
  "29279": "What a shameful disorder in nature, is it not, to make war against women?",
  "29280": "Whereabouts will she be?",
  "29281": "Am I not your comrade?",
  "29282": "But, suppose we should rise up tomorrow and emancipate, who would educate these millions, and teach them how to use their freedom?",
  "29283": "And he has gone, you say?",
  "29284": "Would you go and be dependent on your friends?",
  "29285": "H'm, then you DO give him money?",
  "29286": "Is she, then, preparing for a stroke?",
  "29287": "Where should good news come from to me?",
  "29288": "It is midnight?",
  "29289": "Will you have them fetched back?",
  "29290": "With your family?",
  "29291": "But you have seen him?",
  "29292": "What do you think yourself?",
  "29293": "Had they actually existed?",
  "29294": "And your father was always kind?",
  "29295": "What does it signify?",
  "29296": "And what are you doing here?",
  "29297": "Why were women made beautiful if men are not to regard them?",
  "29298": "I wish to know your name?",
  "29299": "Is he a name for a syndicate?",
  "29300": "When did you do it?",
  "29301": "Which of them will you retain?",
  "29302": "And you are happy?",
  "29303": "Do you refer to her husband's proposal to give her back her own money?",
  "29304": "What holy text can be quoted to justify his assertion?",
  "29305": "Did I not give express orders that I would have no smoking in the office?",
  "29306": "Alive?",
  "29307": "And who on earth, after the daily experience we have, can question the probability of a gentleman marrying anybody?",
  "29308": "How did you get it?",
  "29309": "Cried the other 'Why are you pelting me?",
  "29310": "How do they call you?",
  "29311": "Do you know that you can buy one for less than your rent?",
  "29312": "Oh, has she, has she?",
  "29313": "Supposing someone should come out suddenly?",
  "29314": "Is it riches or physical beauty or noble birth?",
  "29315": "To what end?",
  "29316": "A spy?",
  "29317": "And does the soul admit of death?",
  "29318": "Is it peculiar to you, or is it common to woman?",
  "29319": "And who is your father?",
  "29320": "And is he unhappy?",
  "29321": "What does this mean?",
  "29322": "When shall I be back?",
  "29323": "Had he remained too long?",
  "29324": "What, did they hang the fellow?",
  "29325": "What are you grinning at my father's portrait again for?",
  "29326": "If they indulged their hospitable feasts in the face of danger and death, did these feasts abate the vigor of their enterprise?",
  "29327": "But with what object are they feeding you up?",
  "29328": "And how will you be able to avoid being ashamed, if you do not show equal courage with your commander, when he goes before you into danger?",
  "29329": "How many men?",
  "29330": "I have your permission to retire now, I suppose?",
  "29331": "Then why dontcha openum?",
  "29332": "Have you any idea whom it could have been?",
  "29333": "How can I help being sore?",
  "29334": "What whip lashed them to their knees in shame and submission?",
  "29335": "What have we to reproach that war with?",
  "29336": "And then, about money?",
  "29337": "Who's there?",
  "29338": "Some person in that gloom?",
  "29339": "A rich woman?",
  "29340": "Is there room for me?",
  "29341": "Will anybody buy her?",
  "29342": "Was that when we had a difference of opinion?",

  "29347": "It is agreed, then, that each of them possessed equal rights, is it not?",
  "29348": "Now, since we do the taking of him, why should we not do the rest as well?",
  "29349": "And HE brought you the intelligence, did he?",
  "29350": "She no sooner observed my emotion than she changed colour, and asked what ailed me?",
  "29351": "Do you think then, sir, that these riches are lost because I gather them?",
  "29352": "How is that, la mere?",
  "29353": "Did he tell you you would find him here?",
  "29354": "What, you'll stay, signior?",
  "29355": "Now for your reason?",
  "29356": "Had I forgotten her?",

  "29376": "And how did she die?",
  "29377": "And what would have been your destination?",
  "29378": "How do you make the meat ready?",
  "29379": "To the king?",
  "29380": "Well, what DID you say, then?",
  "29381": "Consult me?",
  "29382": "At last?",

  "29419": "By ruining himself?",
  "29420": "Where was his spleen, his contempt for life, his disillusionment?",
  "29421": "My place?",
  "29422": "I, monseigneur?",
  "29423": "What did he believe about her?",
  "29424": "If you be not content with this my exposition, are you of the mind that my wife will suck and sup me up as people use to gulp and swallow oysters out of the shell?",
  "29425": "What is the use of inflicting that misery on me?",
  "29426": "Twas a mistake?",
  "29427": "What would you have, officer?",
  "29428": "Your mother, is it not, my little citizeness?",
  "29429": "Since you and I separated have you heard them repeated?",
  "29430": "My love, you know these two gentlemen?",
  "29431": "And the peelers never followed after you the eleven days that you're out?",
  "29432": "I beg your pardon?",
  "29433": "And what had determined him?",
  "29434": "Well, are they to go with us or not?",
  "29435": "But what are we to lay down as the outward signs of true civilization?",
  "29436": "IS THERE AN ACCEPTED CONTENT?",
  "29437": "What do you know of the enemy?",
  "29438": "You have seen my portrait, then?",
  "29439": "Will men never be wise?",
  "29440": "Well, when did you go on the stage, anyhow?",
  "29441": "Asks to pay his addresses to me?",
  "29442": "No, it is not so?",
  "29443": "Any folk for me?",
  "29444": "Where did the rest of the brood fly to?",
  "29445": "Is she angry?",
  "29446": "Labouring under such a delusion, why do you not marry?",
  "29447": "Have you forgotten how infinitely miserable I was in that first year?",
  "29448": "What man, and what for?",
  "29449": "Not becoming too old to wear?",
  "29450": "Do you mean tall or short?",
  "29451": "Are you going to keep the gentleman expecting us all day?",
  "29452": "What have you to confess now?",
  "29453": "Where are you going?",
  "29454": "That is probably rather soft?",
  "29455": "Davy who?",

  "29468": "Where must I wait?",
  "29469": "Tell me when?",
  "29470": "In answer to the letter?",
  "29471": "Does your mother know you're out?",
  "29472": "But what about the curses?",
  "29473": "Can the leech have returned, or somewhat else have happened that caused the lady, while I slept, to hide me here?",
  "29474": "Mandrier?",
  "29475": "What floor do you want?",
  "29476": "Do you believe that she loves you?",
  "29477": "I have never met with a man of your intelligence, and heart?",
  "29478": "Do you intend to serve?",
  "29479": "And does not the same hold also of the ridiculous?",

  "29482": "Am I becoming a coward?",
  "29483": "Is she pretty?",
  "29484": "And do you know how it all came about?",
  "29485": "How's ma?",
  "29486": "What made him get up and run away when I came?",
  "29487": "Claim it?",
  "29488": "Would the mere fact of his having been admitted to the house be sufficient?",
  "29489": "Should he there encounter some unexpected knot in the darkness?",
  "29490": "Instead of getting a soft fence against the cold, shadowy, unapplausive audience of his life, had he only given it a more substantial presence?",
  "29491": "And what did you do with that letter?",
  "29492": "What stirs the bush?",
  "29493": "Why do you call it my allowance, and never let me spend it?",
  "29494": "What's more unanswerable than a fact?",
  "29495": "Did he subdue his prejudices, and those of his subjects?",
  "29496": "You are going that way?",
  "29497": "Oh, my king, say yourself, did I not owe it to this poor girl to try everything in order to save her?",
  "29498": "What could I become with these surroundings?",
  "29499": "May I see?",
  "29500": "And why was that, do you suppose?",
  "29501": "Have you anything to ask this witness, boy?",
  "29502": "As the conviction of a notable criminal is at stake, would you be so kind as to send for all your servants?",
  "29503": "But he will take something?",
  "29504": "What must be your nature, that you should so betray his trust?",
  "29505": "But why does your aunt call you her uncle?",
  "29506": "Your occupation?",
  "29507": "You pretend that I am in love, do you not?",

  "29867": "Where has he gone?",
  "29868": "Well, then, how if we were to begin with oysters, and so change the whole program?",
  "29869": "The face he pulled?",
  "29870": "Can they govern a family, or take care of the poor babes whom they bring into the world?",
  "29871": "Is it, then, stretching our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the occasion of the change?",
  "29872": "Neither gold nor rank?",
  "29873": "But was he alone or accompanied?",
  "29874": "WHY, you dear delightful woman, did you like it?",
  "29875": "Who is knocking?",
  "29876": "How can you speak of it in that way?",
  "29877": "Do you mean that we are going to die too?",

  "30159": "Is there no force on this side of the creek?",
  "30160": "If I guess rightly, will you confess it?",
  "30161": "Did you ever hear a definition of fame, sir?",
  "30162": "Ay, but how shall we know the catchpole?",

  "30207": "Why did she love everything so tenderly and so passionately, everything living that was not a man?",
  "30208": "In favor of some member of your family?",
  "30209": "You are angry, monsieur?",
  "30210": "What, he told you so, I suppose?",
  "30211": "What, have they buried him in honour for his services to them?",
  "30212": "To stand from fear set free?",
  "30213": "You are aware, I suppose, that all mythology and poetry is a narration of events, either past, present, or to come?",

  "30219": "Call the captain, and heave the ship aback?",
  "30220": "And did you observe any change in her then?",
  "30221": "Flee alone, and leave you here?",
  "30222": "Can I have lost it?",
  "30223": "Are the sacrifices I have made of honour and modesty to you no proof of my being tied to you in bonds too strong to be broken?",
  "30224": "But what makes you so much out of sorts?",

  "30271": "Why ask?",
  "30272": "Am I to read this?",
  "30273": "Who are you then?",
  "30274": "Was there nothing to fear?",
  "30275": "But did this man hope to conceal himself effectually behind that heap of rubbish, which one need but skirt?",
  "30276": "Then it all depends on that object that you regard, for your reasons, as evidence?",
  "30277": "What if there was no rank of life in which she could now properly attach herself?",
  "30278": "Why then do philosophers look for public spirit?",
  "30279": "How many would he have?",
  "30280": "But do you know this mysterious count is a bachelor?",
  "30281": "Why strive for a coherent, satisfied life?",
  "30282": "Intelligent you call yourselves, do you?",
  "30283": "Did men eat men?",
  "30284": "That is, he was not a boy at all, I suppose?",

  "30286": "Could he not annul the verdict?",
  "30287": "How can something come out of nothing?",
  "30288": "And now, he said, what did we just now call that principle which repels the even?",
  "30289": "What is that error?",
  "30290": "I hurriedly made him a reply to the effect, that I hoped the error into which I had been betrayed by the desperate nature of my love, did not induce him to think me mercenary too?",
  "30291": "What is this place?",
  "30292": "Guy, is this amount of confidence to be our stock to start the new life on?",
  "30293": "How is your head, better?",
  "30294": "What matters that?",
  "30295": "The opportunity is a good one, then?",
  "30296": "But if, in spite of all my precautions, I am at last obliged to fight, will you not be my second?",
  "30297": "May I ask you to be so kind as to inquire of all your subjects if any of them have seen a fishing hook lost in the sea?",
  "30298": "And what is your business?",
  "30299": "Had I better wait till it's three o'clock?",
  "30300": "Why are you not eating anything, gentlemen?",
  "30301": "Does this not amount to your stealing the annual salary from your lord?",
  "30302": "Who'd you reckon?",
  "30303": "WILL IT BE COMMUNISM?",
  "30304": "Are you a married man, sir?",
  "30305": "What dream we of?",
  "30306": "What's the good of taking it in hand now?",
  "30307": "But if he does not come?",
  "30308": "Have you any idea what became of them?",
  "30309": "And why this ABSOLUTISM in the relations of capitalist and laborer?",
  "30310": "Is any man termed a gentleman, that is not always in the fashion?",
  "30311": "Do I ever leave you?",
  "30312": "Are you all of the same opinion?",
  "30313": "Whose was this mighty personality?",
  "30314": "Perhaps you could name the figures of a few wiolincellers of a good tone?",
  "30315": "To marrying whom?",
  "30316": "Am I wrong to come up here to see her?",
  "30317": "You heard my question?",
  "30318": "Why now should I be tempted?",
  "30319": "Where's my maid?",
  "30320": "You're able to read?",
  "30321": "What has he lived on since?",
  "30322": "And you resent it?",
  "30323": "Kennedy was preparing to discharge all his batteries into the middle of the ascending multitude, but what could he have done against such a numberless army?",
  "30324": "Was it not rather a service and a kindly act?",
  "30325": "How could there be when it's barely ten o'clock yet?",
  "30326": "And have you got a paper?",
  "30327": "Where is the girl who promised to marry any one who would release her brother?",
  "30328": "And all arithmetic and calculation have to do with number?",
  "30329": "How do you happen to be here?",
  "30330": "And what is the result?",
  "30331": "And for what have you ruined your life, if you come to think of it?",
  "30332": "Who talks of cadeaux?",
  "30333": "But did you not read that I must be alone?",
  "30334": "Do you find the prisoner guilty or not guilty?",
  "30335": "And he who does not possess and is therefore unable to impart this conception, in whatever degree he fails, may in that degree also be said to fail in intelligence?",
  "30336": "But what's happened to you?",
  "30337": "Are you lost or have the wolves eaten you?",
  "30338": "Yet why do tears blind my eyes?",
  "30339": "Why should I still be subject to these visitations of the devil, when I try so hard to keep him away?",
  "30340": "How do you know what I think?",
  "30341": "But why was the tear in her eye?",
  "30342": "Are you lonesome because you're a magician?",
  "30343": "What had taken place during those ten months?",
  "30344": "You accuse him, then?",
  "30345": "What has anybody to do with that?",
  "30346": "Was I wrong in claiming that confusion reigned among legists, and ought I to be legally prosecuted for having said that their science henceforth stood convicted of falsehood, its glory eclipsed?",
  "30347": "John, which way must we now turn?",
  "30348": "Was I not right?",
  "30349": "Why so breathless a start?",
  "30350": "And have we, at our age, been earnestly discoursing with one another all our life long only to discover that we are no better than children?",
  "30351": "Do you want to go with us?",
  "30352": "Who had taken the letters, if letters there were?",
  "30353": "At any rate, they are all reconciled to it now, I hope?",
  "30354": "And they will place them under the command of experienced veterans who will be their leaders and teachers?",
  "30355": "Even the spiritual vision, is it not at all points arrested by the continuous golden walls of the universe?",
  "30356": "What can you be dreaming of?",
  "30357": "You say again you are quite sure that it was the prisoner?",
  "30358": "Is it any new trouble?",
  "30359": "And talking about the hospital?",
  "30360": "Amid what elegancies of carved furniture, decorated walls, elaborate tapestries did they move?",
  "30361": "If they are really qualified for the task, will not their own hearts be the first to inform them of it?",
  "30362": "What sort of life were that to live?",
  "30363": "What's your trade?",
  "30364": "How could I have been so beguiled?",
  "30365": "How does I talk wild?",
  "30366": "Would we be done for?",
  "30367": "Come, now, my learned friend, what makes you hesitate?",
  "30368": "You have come far?",
  "30369": "But is she not awfully rich?",
  "30370": "Who can make good coffee?",
  "30371": "So we had better leave you?",
  "30372": "Is the downstairs door fast?",
  "30373": "Or if he is to be governed, how can he be governed well?",
  "30374": "Will you have tea here then, or go across to the house, where there's a tent on the lawn?",
  "30375": "Did you observe the colour?",
  "30376": "Can it be?",
  "30377": "Will this assist in explaining the difficulty?",
  "30378": "Is not my son hungry?",
  "30379": "But you, my dear d'Artagnan, what has happened to you?",
  "30380": "You are sure of your enterprise?",
  "30381": "Have you been at the concert?",
  "30382": "What about her horse?",
  "30383": "Mamma, what am I to say to him?",
  "30384": "When is your turn to come?",
  "30385": "Had I thus come in vain into these forests and mountains?",
  "30386": "Do you call that nothing?",
  "30387": "What is it, then, which does judge about them?",
  "30388": "Shall I lend you a hand here?",
  "30389": "Damn you, what do you mean by that?",
  "30390": "And who's that tall chap standing beside her?",
  "30391": "Would any one deny this?",
  "30392": "Did they impose on each industry a proportional tax, so as to preserve a balance in the market?",
  "30393": "What should you do in my place?",
  "30394": "What more could one ask for?",
  "30395": "For who can change men's opinions?",
  "30396": "Would a painter be any the worse because, after having delineated with consummate art an ideal of a perfectly beautiful man, he was unable to show that any such man could ever have existed?",
  "30397": "Have you decided?",
  "30398": "How is your father getting on?",
  "30399": "Were those great, stony cliffs the gates of paradise?",
  "30400": "Shall our rivers and harbors be improved?",
  "30401": "But how do you make it shine through the walls?",
  "30402": "What, do you want to leave us?",
  "30403": "Do you stand me out, mistress?",
  "30404": "How is the poor woman?",
  "30405": "Or, that she should prefer the rant of flattery to the simple accents of sincerity?",
  "30406": "Are you a gentleman?",
  "30407": "Did you speak?",
  "30408": "Shall I see you again before your departure?",
  "30409": "And how are the other people getting on?",
  "30410": "Why should I not go?",
  "30411": "And if they are not fortifying, sire?",
  "30412": "But hark, what music is that?",
  "30413": "What do you suppose they would do to a man disarmed like me?",
  "30414": "Are you really frightened, madame?",
  "30415": "What are you doing, you stupid creature?",
  "30416": "Who will undertake it, if it be not also a service of honour?",
  "30417": "What have you heard?",
  "30418": "But as for me, what solace had I when the days of my fighting were done?",
  "30419": "You were not unfortunate, and yet you are an orphan, fatherless and motherless?",
  "30420": "Would not that have been better evidence?",
  "30421": "Where was my head when I made that grant?",
  "30422": "How will she take it?",
  "30423": "And you order me to announce you to the duchess?",
  "30424": "What more has happened?",
  "30425": "Why did you not tell me, instead of teasing me like this?",
  "30426": "Judah told you?",
  "30427": "So far we are within the bounds of possibility, are we not?",
  "30428": "Will the train soon be in?",
  "30429": "What is your opinion?",
  "30430": "How was it, having so little in reality to conceal, that I always DID feel as if this man were finding me out?",
  "30431": "What I wanted, who can say?",
  "30432": "And pray how do I and these my friends around me seem to you?",
  "30433": "Ah, are you composing poetry, queen?",
  "30434": "What is the use of being exquisite if you are not seen by the best judges?",
  "30435": "Then what was the use of our coming?",
  "30436": "Why do you disappoint me so?",
  "30437": "Are you a child or a teetotum?",
  "30438": "Take head?",
  "30439": "The date?",
  "30440": "Would I do him this favour?",
  "30441": "Do you mind if I go in and tell this man to come on to us when he's finished here?",
  "30442": "Is it in this particular part, or in that other?",
  "30443": "Are you ready to get back the trade on those terms?",
  "30444": "To what does your ambition aspire?",
  "30445": "And all complaining, accusing?",
  "30446": "Is she like me?",
  "30447": "What, none of you?",
  "30448": "You will fulfill your promise to me?",
  "30449": "What sort of animal is this interest?",
  "30450": "You must have known that?",
  "30451": "Was it not I?",
  "30452": "And am I dishonest?",
  "30453": "What's the letter?",
  "30454": "Would it please you to accompany her upon the lake?",
  "30455": "Ladies and gentlemen, what is your opinion on the subject?",
  "30456": "What do you want, sir?",
  "30457": "And where can a man seek ends of any sort beyond this broad field?",
  "30458": "How came you to make such a mistake as this?",
  "30459": "Is it too late?",
  "30460": "How do you feel now?",
  "30461": "Anne, did YOU put sugar in these peas?",
  "30462": "That is to say, justice is useful when money is useless?",
  "30463": "Is not this second infinite, so to speak, subjacent to the first?",
  "30464": "And he said nothing as he died?",
  "30465": "WHO forbade you?",
  "30466": "Gallia out of place?",
  "30467": "And am I not ready to do so again?",
  "30468": "Frightened of what?",
  "30469": "Where do we go first?",
  "30470": "Where are you?",
  "30471": "How did you get yourself into this mess?",
  "30472": "It is not in your possession?",
  "30473": "Will your excellency give your name, or remain incognito?",
  "30474": "Legal proceedings to prevent payment?",
  "30475": "Have you any sort of conveyance?",
  "30476": "I suppose you kissed his hand?",
  "30477": "What's in it?",
  "30478": "How dare you look into this garden?",
  "30479": "How find a straight road of progress, you men of science, of industry, of cooperation, of trades unions, and all the rest?",
  "30480": "Really?",
  "30481": "Is this gentle and lovely being lost forever?",
  "30482": "Weigh out tragedy, like butcher's meat?",
  "30483": "Happy?",
  "30484": "What mingles in the strain?",
  "30485": "What can that be, monsieur le chevalier?",
  "30486": "Why do you seek me?",
  "30487": "What, to buy gingerbread?",
  "30488": "Have the fugitives been pursued?",
  "30489": "Is he likely to marry, uncle?",
  "30490": "Not even a sou?",
  "30491": "What did he want?",
  "30492": "Of course it is very different here, but who knows how long it will last?",
  "30493": "Do you ever try to read your own face?",
  "30494": "No accident has happened to him?",
  "30495": "What have you to do with us?",
  "30496": "What's his name?",
  "30497": "Why, then, I would ask, do we see these lengthened shadows, which follow in the course of our political day?",
  "30498": "And how are they all?",
  "30499": "Larrey?",
  "30500": "Is this his house?",
  "30501": "Who is the man that seeks another man?",
  "30502": "Why, do you smoke?",
  "30503": "Will you have it now?",
  "30504": "When shall we get away?",
  "30505": "Good gracious, what's that?",
  "30506": "Have you been there?",
  "30507": "But why have you come the back way?",
  "30508": "What would you like to have?",
  "30509": "But does the painter know the right form of the bit and reins?",
  "30510": "Indeed?",
  "30511": "Why this jealousy of our advancement?",
  "30512": "With HER?",
  "30513": "And what is justice?",
  "30514": "But how if you and I had married legally, as we were on the point of doing?",
  "30515": "What millions, father?",
  "30516": "WHEREFORE IS LIGHT GIVEN TO HIM THAT IS IN MISERY, AND LIFE UNTO THE BITTER IN SOUL?",
  "30517": "Married him?",
  "30518": "How 't happens?",
  "30519": "Why these splendid buskins?",
  "30520": "Better than what?",
  "30521": "And may I escape by the door, sir, when I have opened it?",
  "30522": "But why with melancholy?",
  "30523": "Do you think that I deserve a recompense?",
  "30524": "Can I take the apple blossoms with me for company?",
  "30525": "How could any vanquish such a mighty antagonist?",
  "30526": "What are you dreaming of?",
  "30527": "Like whom?",
  "30528": "Why did I not fall in love with her then and propose to her?",
  "30529": "I suppose you've got your thumbs?",
  "30530": "Just's?",
  "30531": "And how long were you in the hole?",
  "30532": "What, all sons of silence, no spirit?",
  "30533": "If he fears me, why come hither?",
  "30534": "What do you reckon we better do, now?",
  "30535": "Was it for happiness they wept?",
  "30536": "Mother, may I sit on the sofa beside you?",
  "30537": "False?",
  "30538": "Babies?",
  "30539": "Where did you address your letters, then?",
  "30540": "You know what they say?",
  "30541": "The first question is, of what nature was her communication?",
  "30542": "Why are you wandering about like an outcast?",
  "30543": "But, miss, you will hear one word?",
  "30544": "And to go to the root of the matter, why are you so positively convinced that not to act against his real normal interests guaranteed by the conclusions of reason and arithmetic is certainly always advantageous for man and must always be a law for mankind?",
  "30545": "Does the count know what answer you received?",
  "30546": "Is, then, the woman, who holds out to the bitter end in her desire to have the last word, in so far virtuous?",
  "30547": "Shall we return to the camp?",
  "30548": "Query, ought it not, in strict grammar, to be injecerit, instead of infecit?",
  "30549": "Then you are giving it up?",
  "30550": "Is there anything else that puzzles you?",
  "30551": "Would you leave our village, desert our homes and fly before an enemy approaches?",
  "30552": "What are you to her?",
  "30553": "I expect you're feeling very 'appy today, sir?",
  "30554": "What could your ladyship propose by it?",
  "30555": "Who, then, has more luck than I have?",
  "30556": "When did they cease to be so?",
  "30557": "And what did you detect, if not gratitude?",
  "30558": "Speak I soothly, men of greenwood?",
  "30559": "And do you mean to tell me that I should have been the same man if I had not from a boy associated that old tower with all ideas of what its owners were, and should be, as knights and gentlemen?",
  "30560": "But what made her do that?",
  "30561": "But where will he touch?",
  "30562": "Now what will you take?",
  "30563": "Rupert?",
  "30564": "Do you think to overawe us by this?",
  "30565": "Can you understand it?",
  "30566": "That makes in all?",
  "30567": "Where's your leg?",
  "30568": "Or morn or weary even?",
  "30569": "But will the imitator have either?",
  "30570": "Are you an angel?",
  "30571": "A flash in the pan or a shot?",
  "30572": "Is it the last occupant's furniture?",
  "30573": "But if I were to die, what would you do then?",
  "30574": "That being so, what did it mean?",
  "30575": "Could I believe my eyes?",
  "30576": "You mean all's lost?",
  "30577": "Is what true, madame?",
  "30578": "And pray why?",
  "30579": "Do you know for certain that he was at home last night?",
  "30580": "And who'll manage the matron?",
  "30581": "Through what?",
  "30582": "How does it come about at all?",
  "30583": "How was that, uncle?",
  "30584": "Laugh?",
  "30585": "Are not these very simple truths?",
  "30586": "Is this then an actual force?",
  "30587": "What can she want more?",
  "30588": "What schoolboy of fourteen is ignorant of this remarkable circumstance?",
  "30589": "Whether or not I was properly dressed?",
  "30590": "Quanti per inane volatus?",
  "30591": "Is that what you did at school?",
  "30592": "Perhaps you will think, sir, that prosperity has spoiled me?",
  "30593": "How much do you want?",
  "30594": "What king did not seat him at his table?",
  "30595": "But 'Who, even now, would ever believe it?",
  "30596": "What's to be done?",
  "30597": "You are sure you are not mistaken?",
  "30598": "Do you want to spend anything now?",
  "30599": "Has the girl said anything to you to make you feel thus?",
  "30600": "Do you recollect him?",
  "30601": "If so, what are the key enabling technologies?",
  "30602": "Is this to insult me?",
  "30603": "What side of oneself does one display in evasions?",
  "30604": "And was it a fine baby?",
  "30605": "What are you stopping here for?",
  "30606": "Can you guess why I did that?",
  "30607": "Or what great danger dwells upon my suit?",
  "30608": "My genus, is that you?",
  "30609": "Would you so fain have her as you pretend?",
  "30610": "What is the good of the ear if it tells you the same as the eye?",
  "30611": "Perhaps you do not wish to accept my proposition?",
  "30612": "And you repent already?",
  "30613": "An answer?",
  "30614": "Come now, that's the great thing?",
  "30615": "Was it to be in church?",
  "30616": "What do you intend to ask him?",
  "30617": "Vat I mean?",
  "30618": "Would you like to see the pawnbroker himself?",
  "30619": "Could he, too, write like that, express the melancholy of his soul in verse?",
  "30620": "So the question was, what to do?",
  "30621": "Well enough to question him in that language?",
  "30622": "But what's the meaning of it all?",
  "30623": "Then do you know what I did?",
  "30624": "Might I crave your favour to carry my name to him, and say I beg to say a word in his ear?",
  "30625": "Ah kin you tell wether I've a soul or not?",
  "30626": "What money?",
  "30627": "Is your tobacco perfumed, servant, that you swear by the sweet smoke?",
  "30628": "Could any thing worse be said of property?",
  "30629": "How could it be any other way?",
  "30630": "It is then so near the end?",
  "30631": "Do you know this gentleman?",
  "30632": "May I submit your theory of managing soldiers to a slight test?",
  "30633": "And you mean to tell me that I have been wrong?",
  "30634": "Did she think she was going to have all the money, and to marry somebody she liked?",
  "30635": "Who nails up the coffin?",
  "30636": "Would he, too, weep for him?",
  "30637": "Next?",
  "30638": "You have heard of my dear father, then?",
  "30639": "What does he want?",
  "30640": "Why, is there no cause?",
  "30641": "Shall I assist you in repairing your negligence?",
  "30642": "What's it all about?",
  "30643": "Who would understand their various languages, or direct their stranger and incompatible manners?",
  "30644": "Might she not have to grow used to me and to begin all over again?",
  "30645": "What has your life been, so far?",
  "30646": "Are you strong enough to face it alone?",
  "30647": "HOW WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT A SUPERFICIES TERMINATES IN A POINT?",
  "30648": "Do you talk of a sacrifice?",
  "30649": "Then he sent them a herald asking if they wished to be cut to pieces for the sake of those who had betrayed them, or save their lives and keep their reputation for gallantry?",
  "30650": "But what was the reason of this indignation?",
  "30651": "Had he lacked an opportunity?",
  "30652": "Why do you speak of the unhappiness of your father's wife?",
  "30653": "Where is your father's place of business?",
  "30654": "What profits that?",
  "30655": "Hear me, sir?",
  "30656": "Ah, you will tell all I have said, will you not, reverend sir?",
  "30657": "Do he know you genlmen?",
  "30658": "What'll I do naow?",
  "30659": "Shinshin?",
  "30660": "That is a question which has puzzled many an expert, and why?",
  "30661": "Tibby love, what next?",
  "30662": "Have you come home to be married?",
  "30663": "But how can they think so?",
  "30664": "What think you of that, my daughter?",
  "30665": "Seems you have been out after such?",
  "30666": "Was it not a direct menace against the work which he and his companions had till now conducted so successfully?",
  "30667": "For which side?",
  "30668": "Do you remember what I told you last time?",
  "30669": "What further commands has my lord?",
  "30670": "What have you seen?",
  "30671": "Not play?",
  "30672": "You are not ashamed of the face that has done so much?",
  "30673": "Every word?",
  "30674": "Reproaching you for what?",
  "30675": "And then?",
  "30676": "Do you care for him?",
  "30677": "Do you think that I would tell you a falsehood about it?",
  "30678": "Will that do, or is it too genteel?",
  "30679": "Is there no devil to help me?",
  "30680": "You think it's possible?",
  "30681": "The hanging?",
  "30682": "How can he go about making acquaintances?",
  "30683": "But now what are your plans?",
  "30684": "Will you, I ask once more, show your belief in me by letting me clasp you with my arm?",
  "30685": "Kiesewetter?",
  "30686": "Hope he'll see her?",
  "30687": "Is it, then important?",
  "30688": "Did you really?",
  "30689": "What reason?",
  "30690": "I wonder what's the reason?",
  "30691": "How could they fail to see how they were ruining themselves, lowering their prestige by this appointment?",
  "30692": "Will he continue to give lectures in virtue?",
  "30693": "Why do you flee?",
  "30694": "They ask me, are they to light the candles that have been lighted before or candles that have never been lighted?",
  "30695": "And whose should you say it was?",
  "30696": "On whom did it depend?",
  "30697": "What is it, gentlemen?",
  "30698": "Suppose I refuse?",
  "30699": "That young girl whom they were abducting was not to be brought back?",
  "30700": "Would that be your way of speaking?",
  "30701": "Must they be taught always to be pleasing?",
  "30702": "What advice did he give?",
  "30703": "With what ideas does that letter inspire you?",
  "30704": "What, pray, do you fear?",
  "30705": "Why, what do they DO to her, man?",
  "30706": "Have I got you all straight?",
  "30707": "Shall I throw it all out?",
  "30708": "But how were your companions, unsympathetic?",
  "30709": "After several questions relative to my faith, situation, and family, he asked me bluntly if my mother was damned?",
  "30710": "They had lost twenty years, but what had they gained?",
  "30711": "Why did I not die?",
  "30712": "If you could have her?",
  "30713": "Does the man generally sleep like this?",
  "30714": "What can I do better in the interval between this and the setting of the sun?",
  "30715": "Do personal relations lead to sloppiness in the end?",
  "30716": "And you, being a good man, can pass it as such, and forgive and pity the dreamer, and be lenient and encouraging when he wakes?",
  "30717": "What means the woman?",
  "30718": "Should he descend and make a race for the distant cliffs, or should he hide here until night?",
  "30719": "But what are your intentions?",
  "30720": "Would that make his fortune?",
  "30721": "But about the time when he should drive the cattle homewards, who should he see coming but a great giant with his sword in his hand?",
  "30722": "How did she die?",
  "30723": "Who did the modern wisdom begin now, and no sooner?",
  "30724": "How many scratches have you?",
  "30725": "Am I afraid to look it straight in the face?",
  "30726": "If it is useful, are the individuals who rule the country richer?",
  "30727": "How long?",
  "30728": "Do you not see some loophole, some flaw?",
  "30729": "Is it a bitter dose?",
  "30730": "Was it not on my account that she wished to be laid to rest in this place?",
  "30731": "Would you be a porter?",
  "30732": "Who is this in whom such beauty is radiant?",
  "30733": "But who was your mother?",
  "30734": "What has she left behind her?",
  "30735": "And democracy has her own good, of which the insatiable desire brings her to dissolution?",
  "30736": "Lady, what condition is that?",
  "30737": "How could he run away with the child in his arms?",
  "30738": "Are not ten hours enough for tuition?",
  "30739": "Doubt what?",
  "30740": "But what had been the incidents of this terrible war?",
  "30741": "Can you not clear up the last point in this mystery, and tell us the reasons for your action?",
  "30742": "We have made the circuit of our satellite, then?",
  "30743": "Monsieur is jealous, is he not, sister?",
  "30744": "But, I ask, what is meant by contingent?",
  "30745": "Was it their colours?",
  "30746": "Chaw?",
  "30747": "Why did she not take out her ships and insist on going with him?",
  "30748": "How do you get in?",
  "30749": "How can we get out again from so great a depth?",
  "30750": "What am I to work for when my work is no use to anybody?",
  "30751": "What are the glowing fancies of the sky?",
  "30752": "Then go straight up there, will you?",
  "30753": "Did I not give you a sufficient account of the elements' transmutation, and the blunders that are made of roast for boiled, and boiled for roast?",
  "30754": "What was there about them to confound me in this manner?",
  "30755": "Which is the easiest and most practicable plan, RECONCILIATION OR INDEPENDANCE?",
  "30756": "Would they make much difference?",
  "30757": "Is he a poor creature then, as he does nothing for the public good?",
  "30758": "How has all that been done?",
  "30759": "When is the next rehearsal?",
  "30760": "What has been the matter?",
  "30761": "Where's the flax?",
  "30762": "And what shall we make of him, now we've got him?",
  "30763": "But why does anyone object to his being a dirty fellow?",
  "30764": "To be probable?",
  "30765": "Why, then, do you interest yourself for this young lady, if you did not know her?",
  "30766": "What know you of this man?",
  "30767": "What ails you?",
  "30768": "But who can he be?",
  "30769": "What the devil is this?",
  "30770": "Come here girl, and tell me on what day you were born?",
  "30771": "Should we ever know anything about its opposite shores?",
  "30772": "Then you have seen him?",
  "30773": "Come, how shall we decide?",
  "30774": "To be driven from our village, and our hunting grounds, and not even to be permitted to visit the graves of our forefathers and relatives and our friends?",
  "30775": "What is the primary cause of intellectual degeneracy and, as we shall show continually, civilized misery?",
  "30776": "Where do we go to?",
  "30777": "Then how many are there?",
  "30778": "And why care for those who do not know you?",
  "30779": "Do you call the whole reckoning?",
  "30780": "Where was the clue?",
  "30781": "What should they do?",
  "30782": "Then why do you give way to these fits of melancholy?",
  "30783": "What does it know about government?",
  "30784": "Had the inhabitants fled into the interior?",
  "30785": "What shall we do when daylight comes?",
  "30786": "Yet what happened?",
  "30787": "You did not think of opening your door and looking out into the gallery?",
  "30788": "How could she run so fast?",
  "30789": "Have I changed much since then?",
  "30790": "Why does not every collection of fossil remains afford plain evidence of the gradation and mutation of the forms of life?",
  "30791": "Less guarded and more trustful?",
  "30792": "You would not have known me, would you?",
  "30793": "How big?",
  "30794": "What, then, did it all amount to?",
  "30795": "An enemy?",
  "30796": "Do you look out often?",
  "30797": "You will find him?",
  "30798": "Of me?",
  "30799": "There will be no difficulty in loading up the mules, will there?",
  "30800": "And will you direct us?",
  "30801": "And not in the same hand, perhaps?",
  "30802": "D'Artagnan here?",
  "30803": "Why, I said, do you not see that men are unwillingly deprived of good, and willingly of evil?",
  "30804": "Yet what was this liberty?",
  "30805": "What do you say, shall we go and look for mushrooms today?",
  "30806": "Have you paper there?",
  "30807": "Rich?",
  "30808": "Oh, did you?",
  "30809": "And for your sons?",
  "30810": "Shall not I be a cuckold?",
  "30811": "Whose fault was it?",
  "30812": "Who's interfering with which?",
  "30813": "He certainly likes the child, but will he love me less as his affection grows for her?",
  "30814": "What odds, dear boy?",
  "30815": "What order could be maintained?",
  "30816": "But would you wish your vengeance to do you harm instead of good?",
  "30817": "When there were no people in the bungalow, did we have any mongoose in the garden?",
  "30818": "What are all those good people laughing at over there?",
  "30819": "To arrest you?",
  "30820": "The singers?",
  "30821": "And if it were so, would it be possible to make others so believe?",
  "30822": "But property on what condition?",
  "30823": "How would you like it?",
  "30824": "But has she made you any less discontented with me?",
  "30825": "When's the wedding to be?",
  "30826": "Have you noticed his clothes?",
  "30827": "Has the moon been inhabited?",
  "30828": "You find it too much for you?",
  "30829": "Well, and how shall I receive him?",
  "30830": "What else can we do, what in all the world else?",
  "30831": "You, gentle brother, forged this for my sake?",
  "30832": "That's all you have come for, is it?",
  "30833": "What's a bar sinister?",
  "30834": "What says it?",
  "30835": "I beg your pardon, sir, but I think those gentlemen are military?",
  "30836": "Should I tell him or should I not tell him?",
  "30837": "And who stands safest?",
  "30838": "Lieutenant?",
  "30839": "A sailor, I believe?",
  "30840": "What was the difference between that gallant that's gone and you, sir?",
  "30841": "Are you quite sure of that?",
  "30842": "How can you bear to speak so lightly?",
  "30843": "It is now my turn to ask you 'why?",
  "30844": "Not even got a pencil on you?",
  "30845": "Where, for instance?",
  "30846": "Well, what did he do?",
  "30847": "Why should a man hold a match to the side of his pipe?",
  "30848": "What is it?",
  "30849": "And there it ended?",
  "30850": "Why must I be kept forever muffled up in a scarf and padded boots?",
  "30851": "What in creation made you call him a thief?",
  "30852": "That village a few miles off?",
  "30853": "But why do I not find this rest for this weary heart?",
  "30854": "Why not do something original?",
  "30855": "What are you thinking about?",
  "30856": "How would wild horses drag a secret from a person anyhow?",
  "30857": "But what is the use of it?",
  "30858": "And did he go?",
  "30859": "Is there no way by which I can get it?",
  "30860": "And if any, what?",
  "30861": "Carstone?",
  "30862": "Do you know how to stitch caps?",
  "30863": "And all only for sport?",
  "30864": "Why are we perverse and ask for something else?",
  "30865": "And did he think amiss?",
  "30866": "Is he stupid?",
  "30867": "Was it to end with me?",
  "30868": "What faculty?",
  "30869": "I hope, prince, that you are too progressive to deny this?",
  "30870": "Zaccone?",
  "30871": "How do you do again?",
  "30872": "The race?",
  "30873": "What became of you?",
  "30874": "O why?",
  "30875": "Shall we slay him with our pikes?",
  "30876": "A wedding?",
  "30877": "Deserted you?",
  "30878": "Can any here give a name to such a cry?",
  "30879": "What means this outrage?",
  "30880": "Have you been enjoying yourself?",
  "30881": "And nobody called respecting it?",
  "30882": "When one will have defeated the other, of whom can he complain who has the worst of it?",
  "30883": "By the by, my dear friend, do you not think it would have puzzled these ancient dogmaticians to have determined by which of their two roads it was that the most important and most sublime of all their truths was, in effect, attained?",
  "30884": "Then whom, ARE you talking about?",
  "30885": "You mean that this demands explanation, do you not?",
  "30886": "Can it be a song of joy?",
  "30887": "Did it move, did it float on the surface of the ocean, or did it dive into its depths?",
  "30888": "Reasonable well, I give you thanks, wont you alight?",
  "30889": "Do the gentlemen say so?",
  "30890": "Beasts, did you say?",
  "30891": "Who is coming to tea?",
  "30892": "Put an end?",
  "30893": "How can I tell him to be sober when I have been a beast all my life?",
  "30894": "If free, would he attempt to fly, or would he remain?",
  "30895": "They're not far from here, then?",
  "30896": "Were you a steward or a stoker in those days?",
  "30897": "Is it true that force and right are necessarily on the same side in republican governments?",
  "30898": "Are you aware how small his means are, and of the straitened circumstances of his widow?",
  "30899": "My own?",
  "30900": "It was to meet him here that you came?",
  "30901": "Had he not cause for triumph?",
  "30902": "Will you hear me?",
  "30903": "Never more to be separated?",
  "30904": "What disguise do you propose to adopt?",
  "30905": "How was that managed?",
  "30906": "Is it not so, my friends?",
  "30907": "And he has accepted the call?",
  "30908": "How long have you been cooling your eye there?",
  "30909": "What name go you by?",
  "30910": "And what truth?",
  "30911": "Yes, where is this letter?",
  "30912": "Where away, cook?",
  "30913": "And with regard to the past?",
  "30914": "A deanery for her brother in the church?",
  "30915": "What shall we have, said he, to drink in these deserts?",
  "30916": "Is there any collective action which cannot find its justification in political unity, in patriotism, in the balance of power, or in civilization?",
  "30917": "Lady, when was it that your heart was there?",
  "30918": "Where is humanity?",
  "30919": "Where did he live, then?",
  "30920": "What have I done?",
  "30921": "Whom do you wish to speak about?",
  "30922": "You remain near this part?",
  "30923": "Pray what is your own theory as to what took place?",
  "30924": "What?",
  "30925": "She would smile on me, she would say a word to me, would that do any harm to any one?",
  "30926": "How are you, dear child?",
  "30927": "What origin do they attribute to these rifts?",
  "30928": "Do you think I am not grateful?",
  "30929": "WHAT did you see her doing?",
  "30930": "Under these circumstances, was it perfectly certain that no danger could accrue?",
  "30931": "Why should society work out an extraordinary system of rewards for those whom it is already rewarding automatically?",
  "30932": "If, secondly, the question is asked whether this being is substance, whether it is of the greatest reality, whether it is necessary, and so forth?",
  "30933": "How could I wait so long?",
  "30934": "Well, have I convinced you?",
  "30935": "Oh, where am I to go?",
  "30936": "You will not let me speak?",
  "30937": "Nothing, I suppose?",
  "30938": "And if they were pleased, would that make them immortal?",
  "30939": "What do they say to this?",
  "30940": "What design has the cardinal upon you to make him so generous?",
  "30941": "Is it indeed so?",
  "30942": "How came you to be walking here?",
  "30943": "There is the other service, the old one, that which belonged to my husband?",
  "30944": "A room just above?",
  "30945": "Will their successors falter and plead organic impotency in the nation?",
  "30946": "Now what do you think?",
  "30947": "It is in my power, think you, to make such a change at demand?",
  "30948": "It will have pity?",
  "30949": "What can I propose?",
  "30950": "Should I not be disingenuously serving my own ends?",
  "30951": "How is bread made?",
  "30952": "Do you recall him?",
  "30953": "Landlords?",
  "30954": "Should they ever again find themselves in the midst of their friends, or seated at the domestic hearth?",
  "30955": "To lead me to my death, is that enough?",
  "30956": "What use am I to make of your instruction?",
  "30957": "Where?",
  "30958": "Shall we, then, establish it for a general maxim, that no refined or elaborate reasoning is ever to be received?",
  "30959": "How did you get such big big hips?",
  "30960": "How about me?",
  "30961": "Oh?",
  "30962": "Is it deemed a holy place in the land, then?",
  "30963": "The king has not signed, however?",
  "30964": "Why the delay of a reargument?",
  "30965": "But how do you know?",
  "30966": "Should I ever meet you there?",
  "30967": "But if he did marry her in spite of the threat?",
  "30968": "Did I say a peach?",
  "30969": "What has happened since then to give you a completely new idea of the case?",
  "30970": "Has a young man, such as I am, gone through this morning, then?",
  "30971": "What am I to say, indoors?",
  "30972": "How did he evolve his ethics?",
  "30973": "Have you seen the thief?",
  "30974": "Do virtuous men, in so far as they are virtuous, stand in each other's light?",
  "30975": "Shall we bathe this morning?",
  "30976": "What's the matter now, ma'am?",
  "30977": "And is no allowance to be made for inadvertence, or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment?",
  "30978": "Or is it actual?",
  "30979": "How does she look?",
  "30980": "Married another?",
  "30981": "Do with him?",
  "30982": "And what may his name be, coptain?",
  "30983": "You might have stayed away, I suppose, if you would?",
  "30984": "Brown, convicted of mutinous conduct and sentenced to death?",
  "30985": "Who will become the sharer of this dangerous secret?",
  "30986": "What is the gift of conquest but safety?",
  "30987": "French, eh?",
  "30988": "Is he too so very remarkable?",
  "30989": "Who do you think is going to be married tomorrow?",
  "30990": "Both, on the other hand, had joined pretty gaily in the conversation, for why should they interrupt it?",
  "30991": "I regulate my watch?",
  "30992": "Do you hear, sir?",
  "30993": "How can girls like to have lovers and refuse them?",
  "30994": "Have you finished tea?",
  "30995": "What like was she?",
  "30996": "Has anything extraordinary happened to you?",
  "30997": "Who made this gruel here?",
  "30998": "And where are they?",
  "30999": "If you had been born such, would you have been here now?",
  "31000": "But how do you come here?",
  "31001": "But I wonder is it so very nice?",
  "31002": "Did it hurt you much?",
  "31003": "On what principle, then, shall we any longer choose justice rather than the worst injustice?",
  "31004": "Do you reckon YOU can learn 'em anything?",
  "31005": "What do I read here?",
  "31006": "What woman can before her husband?",
  "31007": "Who has the right to dictate to my conscience, and where did he get that right?",
  "31008": "Is she coming, and open, free?",
  "31009": "By your orders?",
  "31010": "To dig the foundations out from under that cabin with?",
  "31011": "My dear child, how can I help minding?",
  "31012": "Is this so?",
  "31013": "You'll make up for it by making another?",
  "31014": "Bubbles?",
  "31015": "Are you willing to endure to the last, and not once attempt a repayment?",
  "31016": "What are they, my dear friend?",
  "31017": "What d' you want o' him again?",
  "31018": "I hope you think so?",
  "31019": "But why on earth should it bother him?",
  "31020": "I wonder whether I've done well in advising that amusement?",
  "31021": "Had I?",
  "31022": "Jack?",
  "31023": "What means can I take to introduce it to the world?",
  "31024": "And so it came about that the young rat did see a good deal of the world, but how?",
  "31025": "But they will contest the will after your death?",
  "31026": "Walks by night, does she?",
  "31027": "And who is it to belong to?",
  "31028": "Is that enough?",
  "31029": "What about souls?",
  "31030": "But what have you been doing?",
  "31031": "Do we need common sense and fairness in our regulations?",
  "31032": "Oh, who does not desire to dwell forever and forever in that city of love and light when the pains and sorrows, the trials and tears, of this weary life are over?",
  "31033": "Have you let your lodgings, ma'am?",
  "31034": "Ought we to rank this one species with bears, and what should we do with the other species?",
  "31035": "Were you not engaged in it then?",
  "31036": "How do you know that, sir?",
  "31037": "Is it conscious?",
  "31038": "What do you know on the subject?",
  "31039": "And what, pray, is your idea of the duties of a devoted friend?",
  "31040": "Who can desire it more than I?",
  "31041": "What would you propose doing?",
  "31042": "What chance have I?",
  "31043": "What were his charms?",
  "31044": "Why should they not work for a uniform minimum of labour conditions through all their communities?",
  "31045": "So he has turned you out?",
  "31046": "Come for long?",
  "31047": "By the way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from?",
  "31048": "Why should he be so mean now?",
  "31049": "DO with it?",
  "31050": "Ask you what provocation I have had?",
  "31051": "Not know the thing which my own eyes beheld?",
  "31052": "Anything else?",
  "31053": "Will you taste for yourself?",
  "31054": "It's not a very nice night to be out, is it?",
  "31055": "You'll come and meet me as usual, girls?",
  "31056": "Now, had I come upon a hopeless incompatibility?",
  "31057": "Do you know what you're doing?",
  "31058": "Quite a vineyard, hey?",
  "31059": "Do I flatter myself if I allow myself to look at it in that way?",
  "31060": "Have I done right?",
  "31061": "He's all right?",
  "31062": "How can I ever thank you for all the deep obligations you impose upon me every day?",
  "31063": "Ought we not to make something great out of a youth, under twenty, who has, in the highest degree, quickness to conceive and courage to execute?",
  "31064": "Was there no loophole of escape?",
  "31065": "I suppose we must take the shapes of beasts?",
  "31066": "What are you surprised at?",
  "31067": "What did they matter when he played divinely?",
  "31068": "Tell me the why of this?",
  "31069": "But is it that makes you go?",
  "31070": "Will you graciously let me kiss your hand?",
  "31071": "Who are you to ask me my business?",
  "31072": "But does not this question make a disturbance outside of political circles?",
  "31073": "What influence can I possibly have over a bandit?",
  "31074": "Is there a carriage at the door?",
  "31075": "Do you still wish to do so?",
  "31076": "At all events, what use was there in delaying?",
  "31077": "And what right had she to be cross?",
  "31078": "What's the good, if you're sick with love for him?",
  "31079": "How should you?",
  "31080": "Is that fine, keen edge upon your soul that gives such avidity for holy things?",
  "31081": "What of the resemblance?",
  "31082": "Why a locksmiths' association in a village?",
  "31083": "Or must I fly the country altogether?",
  "31084": "What would have been the result?",
  "31085": "Back at last?",
  "31086": "What else could this fragment be but the sole surviving remnant of some sumptuous mansion that once had stood on this unrivaled site?",
  "31087": "In relation to what objects?",

  "31091": "What were you eating there all by yourself for your dinner?",
  "31092": "Are you going to sail in?",
  "31093": "Wonder if you'll ever drag me up there?",
  "31094": "Is there any need to hurry, sir?",
  "31095": "Still I ask you, what is this to me?",
  "31096": "And leave the litter as it is?",
  "31097": "Do you advance with him?",
  "31098": "So perhaps I shall rub on?",
  "31099": "In front or behind?",
  "31100": "And by what authority?",
  "31101": "Yea, what then?",
  "31102": "I really could not say?",
  "31103": "And does he imagine that the coadjutor will put himself out for him?",
  "31104": "Do you think she will ever forget that her son is her safeguard, her shield, the pledge for her dignity, for her fortune and her life?",
  "31105": "You said prince, did you not?",
  "31106": "Was it worth it?",
  "31107": "What young ladies?",
  "31108": "Shall we turn back?",
  "31109": "At the end of your name stands for?",
  "31110": "Is it not time to decide finally the meaning of the gift of the great fortune now all in your hand, and growing?",
  "31111": "Well, are we going to stand here all day?",
  "31112": "Who would not acknowledge that a poor man or woman, fain to earn daily bread by the sweat of the brow, is far more reprehensible in yielding to the solicitations of love, than a rich lady, whose life is lapped in ease and unrestricted luxury?",
  "31113": "Have we reached the limits of what reason can supply?",
  "31114": "What should I say?",
  "31115": "Did you ever, O king, hear a cat purring over a bowl of broth, or the buzzing of beetles in the twilight, or a shrill tongued old woman scolding your head off?",
  "31116": "What will gladden your heart?",
  "31117": "Are you sure it will be the last time?",
  "31118": "What is that for a man to do?",
  "31119": "Since when?",
  "31120": "Why, soldiers, why?",
  "31121": "How came you to read some of those queerer ones?",
  "31122": "Did you not love your husband either?",

  "31128": "When was it?",
  "31129": "Does it belong to anybody in the neighbourhood?",
  "31130": "Has anything happened?",
  "31131": "Did you hit her?",
  "31132": "Is there any signal for the general rally?",
  "31133": "About what age is he?",
  "31134": "And why did I come here?",
  "31135": "What mercy can you expect from the man whom you have wronged?",
  "31136": "Have I taken an oath of some sort, then?",
  "31137": "Shall we say, in such a case, that the will of the majority was for the ultimate end?",
  "31138": "Where what?",
  "31139": "You say?",
  "31140": "Do you no longer like to think of your mother?",
  "31141": "What are you doing?",
  "31142": "May I understand, sir, that you threat is withdrawn, and that my income is secure?",
  "31143": "Are the two so deeply separated in this town, that there is no place whatever for an honest workman between them?",
  "31144": "Why then should a man cling to a longer stay here?",
  "31145": "The symptoms are marked, do you see?",
  "31146": "Whether fate, whose circle surrounds us, exercises a control over our liberty so imperious and compulsory that infractions of the law, committed under the dominion of antinomies, cease to be imputable to us?",
  "31147": "But supposing we had the authority, I would ask what good can result from the examination?",
  "31148": "What am I coming for?",
  "31149": "But settled?",
  "31150": "Did I like his voice?",
  "31151": "How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor?",
  "31152": "Who to?",
  "31153": "And the girl?",
  "31154": "Well, have you had a good hunt, have you botanised successfully?",
  "31155": "And why should you want to spite her?",
  "31156": "What did you pick me up for?",
  "31157": "And what does 'in my name' mean?",
  "31158": "Have you ever seen it?",
  "31159": "When, then, did father and son exchange shields, and why?",
  "31160": "Would he have been justified in sacrificing his own child, even if he could thereby save another's?",
  "31161": "Why are you only laying one place?",
  "31162": "Loves him?",
  "31163": "Yet who are the folk whom you find HERE?",
  "31164": "Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?",
  "31165": "Who is coming in here?",
  "31166": "What was she going to say, and what reply would she get?",
  "31167": "Can you tell me how to go about getting on the stage?",
  "31168": "What was your idea, then?",
  "31169": "Running from what?",
  "31170": "Valdemar?",
  "31171": "How are you going to manage to get out?",
  "31172": "Have you a portmanteau?",
  "31173": "What does it matter?",
  "31174": "What depth have we now reached?",
  "31175": "What the deuse do we men go to school for?",
  "31176": "If it be called swamp or sky?",
  "31177": "Defend ourselves against D'Artagnan?",
  "31178": "How the devil is he so like?",
  "31179": "Once more, will you undertake it?",
  "31180": "Are not these functions proper to the soul, and can they rightly be assigned to any other?",
  "31181": "Was it sheer blind force of passion that would satisfy her now?",
  "31182": "How's this, dear niece?",
  "31183": "Do you know who that was?",
  "31184": "Was SHE at the ball too?",
  "31185": "And what made you ask it of me?",
  "31186": "Do you know that if we should ship, it would serve you quite right?",
  "31187": "Where are your wits?",
  "31188": "Is it possible, dear, that what I hear is true?",
  "31189": "No clue?",
  "31190": "Will you give me as far from the river as you can distinguish the belly of a horse?",
  "31191": "So what if he died, how did this concern the boy?",
  "31192": "Build I in the winds my dwelling?",
  "31193": "And what more free than he that desireth nothing upon earth?",
  "31194": "And you have them?",
  "31195": "Did I indeed, sir?",
  "31196": "And are greater miracles to be performed by those who do not follow his footsteps, who healed the body to reach the mind?",
  "31197": "And did I say there was any difficulty?",
  "31198": "Have I not got a brave determination of all my doubts, and a response in all things agreeable to the oracle that gave it?",
  "31199": "Could I leave the lady alone?",
  "31200": "Is it really?",
  "31201": "Do you think I'm not sufficiently ruining my health living here amid the continual emanations of the pharmacy?",
  "31202": "How should she be able to compose herself when she should first see him?",
  "31203": "But tell me, what would you have done?",
  "31204": "Confused?",
  "31205": "Wherefrom do they acquire these tendencies, these peculiarities?",
  "31206": "Who first seduced them to that foul revolt?",
  "31207": "If they want to jump down, now, and get into trouble, who objects?",
  "31208": "Do you regard that meaning as offensive?",
  "31209": "And why does the former operation end exactly when the latter commences?",
  "31210": "What is your notion?",
  "31211": "What now was my plain duty?",
  "31212": "But where can one jump to?",
  "31213": "And how were they?",
  "31214": "Who told you his name?",
  "31215": "Who and where is he?",
  "31216": "Shall we then raise cuckolds?",
  "31217": "But that I make no admissions?",
  "31218": "Am I deceived?",
  "31219": "What's the good of daylight now?",
  "31220": "Does any man ask himself what profit he has gained from the fulfilment of his dreams, if he must still endure, still undergo hunger and thirst and toil and trouble and care?",
  "31221": "What are the facts?",
  "31222": "Have you nothing to say to us?",
  "31223": "Can you tell when there is a good fire?",
  "31224": "What on earth will she say to me, I wonder?",
  "31225": "Did you anticipate the accident which has happened to your granddaughter?",
  "31226": "What cause had you to make discoveries of his pretended passion?",
  "31227": "Elopement?",
  "31228": "How shall I be able to endure life for thirteen years?",
  "31229": "How deeply sir, you apprehend it?",
  "31230": "Cake or bread and butter?",
  "31231": "Or might you have only travelled for your amusement?",
  "31232": "Who has not seen poor birds caught by their feet in the lime?",
  "31233": "I have seen you before, I think?",
  "31234": "Does not the practice of despoiling an enemy afford an excuse for not facing the battle?",
  "31235": "The place is then, as you know, determined on rebellion?",
  "31236": "And was that the upshot of my life's hardest battle?",
  "31237": "When did you shed tears over lost souls?",
  "31238": "Is it not horrible?",
  "31239": "On plantation?",
  "31240": "When you say it that way it sounds comical, does it not?",
  "31241": "What did you do with the girl?",
  "31242": "Who would want to injure us, or damage the projectile?",
  "31243": "How do you distinguish them?",
  "31244": "Haidee, would it please you not to leave me?",
  "31245": "In the name of the ninth day, what manner of creature are you?",
  "31246": "It is then a service which you propose to render us, count?",
  "31247": "Why a blue coat?",
  "31248": "Are you here for good?",
  "31249": "What was I telling you?",
  "31250": "Snakes?",
  "31251": "Ought she to shrink in this way from the long penance of life, which was all the possibility she had of lightening the load to some other sufferers, and so changing that passionate error into a new force of unselfish human love?",
  "31252": "May I ask you a question?",
  "31253": "And yet does not your honor fear to compromise yourself by allowing such a sum to be carried away for the service of your enemy?",
  "31254": "Then have we got to part?",
  "31255": "But what do you want to do with these chickens?",
  "31256": "Do you suggest that I should do that to a similarly garbed female?",
  "31257": "And if I do not read it, what shall you do, mamma?",
  "31258": "What is going on here?",
  "31259": "Can I see her first?",
  "31260": "And the profits are large?",
  "31261": "You let him go?",
  "31262": "How can he save them?",
  "31263": "Barkis, do you mean?",
  "31264": "All right, is it?",
  "31265": "Is that the sort of fellow?",
  "31266": "And that's all you want?",
  "31267": "Number of what, child?",
  "31268": "Well, now, when you orators get that off next year, and, may be, this very year, how would you like some old grizzled farmer to get up in the grove and deny it?",
  "31269": "Fluffed in his lines, did he?",
  "31270": "But was resistance and, in the last place, victory possible?",
  "31271": "Ought not a son to love his father, whatever happens?",
  "31272": "Why, you wished to have a talk with me when the others left?",
  "31273": "Have you ever heard anything particular respecting his birth?",
  "31274": "But how did we become engaged?",
  "31275": "Did this man belong to the double enigma of order and disorder?",
  "31276": "Then he has travelled?",
  "31277": "Will you not take my word?",
  "31278": "I pray you say, what would you ask?",
  "31279": "What is the name of this obliging youth?",
  "31280": "Have they sentenced you?",
  "31281": "I am the ghost's accomplice?",
  "31282": "And has not this been our own case in the matter of equals and of absolute equality?",
  "31283": "And if I do my duty and do right, you will sustain me, will you not?",
  "31284": "Do not you also?",
  "31285": "His race, his form, his name almost unknown?",
  "31286": "But you will see him yourself?",
  "31287": "'What do you mean?",
  "31288": "And yet they say that war is like a game of chess?",
  "31289": "But what does he want of them?",
  "31290": "But what's your real name?",
  "31291": "Then why did you stay with us, and blast your prospects?",
  "31292": "And the salary?",
  "31293": "Have you heard the news, sir?",
  "31294": "Or to what port are we bound?",
  "31295": "Why, then, is it, when neither law nor justice forbids it, that we are asked to spend our time and money in inquiring into its truth?",
  "31296": "And what will all her learning and her daintiness do for her, now?",
  "31297": "How has this terrible past been recalled?",
  "31298": "Am I to feed upon wisdom like a dog?",
  "31299": "Indeed, why not?",
  "31300": "Could not you, sir, estimate their maximum?",
  "31301": "Is this the fact?",
  "31302": "Barsad?",
  "31303": "And our poor cactuses, where are they?",
  "31304": "What muscles he had?",

  "31307": "Have they allowed the headsman to escape?",
  "31308": "Is perseverance a virtue?",
  "31309": "Can you ever forgive me?",
  "31310": "You really think that your solution must be correct?",
  "31311": "Have we not already seen enough of the fallacy and extravagance of those idle theories which have amused us with promises of an exemption from the imperfections, weaknesses and evils incident to society in every shape?",
  "31312": "You have nothing further to say to me?",
  "31313": "Shall I cut away?",
  "31314": "Has he asked you to be his wife?",
  "31315": "Now, what's up?",
  "31316": "PISTHETAERUS I?",
  "31317": "Is there anything you dislike in me that you act so contrarily to my wishes?",
  "31318": "Anger?",
  "31319": "Is it not some bad affair?",
  "31320": "Will you do it?",
  "31321": "I wonder how many I shall meet going back?",
  "31322": "Could it be possible that they had escaped?",
  "31323": "Are you SURE you were quite comfortable?",
  "31324": "Had he any weapons?",
  "31325": "Was there no way by which I might have enjoyed in freedom comforts even greater than those which I now earn by servitude?",
  "31326": "What is spirit?",
  "31327": "Then why were you taught to shoot?",
  "31328": "What good comes of it?",
  "31329": "What happened to me?",
  "31330": "What was it that set our two hearts eternally apart and made hope impossible?",

  "31332": "Ruinous, why?",
  "31333": "Was she really a stenographer?",
  "31334": "Is it possible that he died in the bitter frame of mind he was then in?",
  "31335": "And what do you reckon your outfit will cost?",
  "31336": "Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?",
  "31337": "But, by the holy city, why does he make me pay for what anybody else could have for nothing?",
  "31338": "What did he talk about?",
  "31339": "I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your sleep?",
  "31340": "Who was it you were talking with over there?",
  "31341": "You mean that you forget?",
  "31342": "You have a chamber?",
  "31343": "What was I doing with the lady?",
  "31344": "What did they understand by it?",
  "31345": "What does he wish to gain by it, I wonder?",
  "31346": "Is it not a beautiful language and admirable?",
  "31347": "You do not add imagination to your other great qualities, but if you could for one moment put yourself in the place of this young man, would you choose the very night after the will had been made to commit your crime?",
  "31348": "Sdeath, what's this to me?",
  "31349": "Why, what other strangers are coming in?",
  "31350": "Why does the parent turn away from his child, and forbid him his presence for a time?",
  "31351": "What is a shame?",
  "31352": "And you ask me, whether I am an adherent of that church which maligns and damns you?",
  "31353": "You are rich?",
  "31354": "Do you know him still?",
  "31355": "Not understand it, sir?",
  "31356": "If they were all bad, who had made them so?",
  "31357": "What encouraged me not to become your surety, but to patronize you?",
  "31358": "Who ever gave again the breath of a life lost?",
  "31359": "Did he say when he would be back?",
  "31360": "Yes or no, is it an honorable indemnity?",
  "31361": "As how?",
  "31362": "Do you imagine that this anaemic youth was capable of so frightful an assault?",
  "31363": "How many would you have?",
  "31364": "Otherwise why should she thus have concealed herself, fled from the face of others?",
  "31365": "Any money?",
  "31366": "Where stand his coursers?",
  "31367": "What are we coming to?",
  "31368": "And why is one person to be singled out from among millions, and arraigned before posterity as a traitor to his opinions only because events produced on him the effect which they produced on a whole generation?",
  "31369": "But the real cause was heart disease?",
  "31370": "But does he know this secret, then?",
  "31371": "Is he liked for himself?",
  "31372": "What should it be?",
  "31373": "Anybody gone in for her?",
  "31374": "We are overheard, then?",
  "31375": "You other two belong to this division?",
  "31376": "All or one?",
  "31377": "Are you really a connoisseur, now?",
  "31378": "Did he tell you so?",

  "31409": "Well, old lady?",
  "31410": "But you want to speak to me, I suppose?",
  "31411": "Where have you been?",
  "31412": "To compete with phrasemongers, incapable of thinking consecutively for sixty seconds?",
  "31413": "Have I the time?",
  "31414": "Tea?",
  "31415": "What did you begin to tell me about the prince?",
  "31416": "Did anybody ever ask you?",
  "31417": "YOU think so?",
  "31418": "Can you give me no other weapon?",
  "31419": "Is that the moon?",
  "31420": "Nothing but saddles?",
  "31421": "Or would I have all the daughters at once in a perfect nosegay?",
  "31422": "Shall our eyes gaze on and on, and feast themselves on that sight for all eternity?",
  "31423": "What are you making such a noise about over there?",
  "31424": "What is your opinion of the gentlemen with the silk caps who thrive along the boulevard's on the delightful traffic which you know, and who make a living out of it?",
  "31425": "And your home?",

  "32638": "But what could he have to do with this old family custom of ours, and what does this rigmarole mean?",
  "32639": "Will you take my arm, sir?",
  "32640": "Is it in my character?",
  "32641": "Uncle, what wood is this?",
  "32642": "Well, what did he say then?",
  "32643": "There they were, the words, and what did she want more?",
  "32644": "What does he desire of me?",
  "32645": "Are you like all the rest?",
  "32646": "How dare you grin at me like that?",
  "32647": "Who will make me that summons?",
  "32648": "Especially with copper toes?",
  "32649": "Was it the effect of the lunar rays?",
  "32650": "What have you said?",
  "32651": "You never find he slights his work when your back is turned?",
  "32652": "Perhaps you would like to pay interest?",
  "32653": "Which is she?",
  "32654": "Is that any reason why we should propose to preserve it for ever in a condition of tutelage?",
  "32655": "And my walking up and down for three hours from the table to the stove?",
  "32656": "Not chops?",
  "32657": "Would he choose the peers, for example?",
  "32658": "Why, how are you?",
  "32659": "Who persuaded them into letting him see if he could drive?",
  "32660": "Do you think you can behead me with a single blow?",
  "32661": "Where is the letter?",
  "32662": "Poor old who?",
  "32663": "Me?",
  "32664": "Do you know this person?",
  "32665": "What WILL he do, then?",
  "32666": "Where do you expect to get to?",
  "32667": "Your birthday?",
  "32668": "What have your family got to do with it?",
  "32669": "How much do I get?",
  "32670": "But may he not change and transform himself?",
  "32671": "It is not so?",
  "32672": "Then I shall really have them?",
  "32673": "So you go back from your promise?",
  "32674": "May she?",
  "32675": "Do you remember what I said when you asked me what I should do if I won all the pots I set my heart on and came through alive?",
  "32676": "Is it too great?",
  "32677": "At it again, hey?",
  "32678": "Which was it?",
  "32679": "Do you believe in presentiments and superstitions?",
  "32680": "Are you now satisfied?",
  "32681": "Your success too?",
  "32682": "The bandits whom the abbe keeps in pay and drink have their useful side, have they?",
  "32683": "Can a man who listens to these three counsellors be sure that he is right in a given decision?",
  "32684": "Have we not perfectly understood each other?",
  "32685": "There is a good postal service, I suppose?",
  "32686": "Comes it in there?",
  "32687": "Tell us now, at once, what you made of the present?",
  "32688": "What is popular sovereignty?",
  "32689": "Do you think we are sure to come out of the wilderness?",
  "32690": "How hang your pouches?",
  "32691": "Should you like to be her boatman?",
  "32692": "How did I survive and surmount such wounds?",
  "32693": "How often we sin, how much we deceive, and all for what?",
  "32694": "Will soon what?",
  "32695": "And we recognize also that this absolute equality has only been known, and can only be known, through the medium of sight or touch, or of some other of the senses, which are all alike in this respect?",
  "32696": "Know you anything of your own family at that time?",
  "32697": "And from a noble client?",
  "32698": "So that, in fact, you have never learned or heard anything in particular?",
  "32699": "What was said or done?",
  "32700": "And where will your worship drink?",
  "32701": "How is it that you have no friends in your prosperity when you had many in adversity?",

  "32707": "And will he be the better for that?",
  "32708": "What's the matter with your nose, there?",
  "32709": "Now I ax what have they to show for their three months' setting?",
  "32710": "Cherries?",
  "32711": "How are we to know them if we do find them?",
  "32712": "What about the other girl, the one you decoyed away over a week ago?",
  "32713": "How could she not be happy?",
  "32714": "It has been a delightful evening, has it not?",
  "32715": "And now, doctor, what are we to do about money?",
  "32716": "Had they not searched exactly where the document stated?",
  "32717": "How you like it, hey, ole sport?",
  "32718": "But what human language can adequately portray that astonishment, that horror which possessed me at the spectacle then presented to view?",
  "32719": "At best, might not a man in the water lose all his power of direction, and so move in an endless circle until he sank exhausted?",
  "32720": "Does his wife know of it?",
  "32721": "And what is the solar heat?",
  "32722": "If any one were to come in, my dear boy?",
  "32723": "Has your grace taken the precaution to come out in a good stout pair of boots?",
  "32724": "Whet, whoiver knew yah wur coming?",
  "32725": "Where would you wish to go?",
  "32726": "What tidings of the foe?",
  "32727": "Why do I think of her as dressed in green?",
  "32728": "How could he take the infant from the mother's breast, or abandon the daughter to the fatal influences from which only, by so violent an effort, he could free the son?",
  "32729": "Was that all a human being amounted to?",
  "32730": "But you would not advise me to refuse?",
  "32731": "And so much to my honour too?",
  "32732": "And why look there?",
  "32733": "And have you no mind of my weight of passion, and the holy dispensation, and the drift of heifers I am giving, and the golden ring?",
  "32734": "Did you know her?",
  "32735": "And do you not know, I said, that all mere opinions are bad, and the best of them blind?",
  "32736": "But you're not going away?",
  "32737": "I forgive you?",
  "32738": "What do I care?",
  "32739": "I say, you are not jealous, are you?",
  "32740": "Where is he wounded?",
  "32741": "But what is to be the object of this capricious partiality in the national councils?",
  "32742": "The one in the dark blue coat?",
  "32743": "Want any?",
  "32744": "But why?",
  "32745": "And could it be believed that it at last seems to us as if the problem had never been propounded before, as if we were the first to discern it, get a sight of it, and RISK RAISING it?",
  "32746": "If you come to that, it's hardly my place to be flung out of the flat like this and have to go to an hotel, what?",
  "32747": "Will you open, yes or no?",
  "32748": "If so, on what does your constitution rest?",
  "32749": "With whom?",

  "32757": "What a state of society is this for a free country?",
  "32758": "Was it in the afternoon?",
  "32759": "Do you want me to explain what that is?",
  "32760": "Is this a fairy country?",
  "32761": "Is it a thing, or is it a name, or is it a fraud?",
  "32762": "Can you come with me?",
  "32763": "Did you see by the paper they are going to call out the militia?",
  "32764": "Do the footmen kiss her?",
  "32765": "But why does she lie on a sofa?",
  "32766": "What answer was sent?",
  "32767": "What, billing, exchanging stolen glances and broken murmurs?",
  "32768": "Who would not prefer that possibility to the unceasing agitations and frequent revolutions which are the continual scourges of petty republics?",

  "32770": "What vapour is that?",
  "32771": "Look at that medder, beant it lovely?",
  "32772": "Who would undertake to feed such an enormous multitude?",
  "32773": "By the way, would you mind lending me your matches?",
  "32774": "How could she, a woman, not yet bereft of youth or charms, live alone in the forest, among a troop of soldiers?",

  "32779": "What are they to do?",
  "32780": "Why, how can it be just to beat a father?",
  "32781": "What, are you crossing of yourself?",
  "32782": "But are you not afraid to leave the horse in his power now, since he has every interest in injuring it?",
  "32783": "Why did you come, then?",
  "32784": "What was the abbe's name?",
  "32785": "Never see you again?",
  "32786": "Would the lock click at the end of those seemingly interminable intervals of time?",
  "32787": "Comes he not?",
  "32788": "Why am I left here alone?",
  "32789": "Do you mean to say you think we are going to have bad weather?",
  "32790": "But who attributes to the animals a belief that the phenomena of nature are worked by a multitude of invisible animals or by one enormous and prodigiously strong animal behind the scenes?",
  "32791": "Why were these prisoners not disarmed?",
  "32792": "Why is there this difference?",
  "32793": "You must surely also have been married?",
  "32794": "Why did not he attack at once?",
  "32795": "Were the shutters closed?",
  "32796": "Camels?",
  "32797": "What are you afraid of, prince?",
  "32798": "What more COULD it be?",

  "32802": "And what shall I say of his virtues?",
  "32803": "What can you expect?",
  "32804": "Are you a patriot?",
  "32805": "Whom do you speak of?",
  "32806": "You will write to her in a day or two?",
  "32807": "Ha, lady?",
  "32808": "Do you want to be let in?",
  "32809": "Was it her character, or her mind, or her nature?",
  "32810": "What is the matter, love?",
  "32811": "What could he be looking for on that immense expanse?",
  "32812": "And how the deuce could I, even if I knew every girl in the place?",
  "32813": "But would she pass on, or would she put into port?",
  "32814": "You looked into the cellars?",
  "32815": "How could you be so rude, so mean, and cruel to us both?",
  "32816": "Was not the selection of the male guardians determined by differences of this sort?",
  "32817": "Why, who do you think this is?",
  "32818": "Is that his design in settling here?",
  "32819": "You teach in it yourself?",
  "32820": "But how did it originate?",
  "32821": "What in the world, between them, ever took place?",
  "32822": "Where does the needle and thread come from?",
  "32823": "But what was that?",
  "32824": "Do you not think that, in putting it as you have done, you have been unjust?",
  "32825": "Do you wish to assassinate a man who, in the eyes of heaven, is a brother?",
  "32826": "Did she know where her husband was?",
  "32827": "Then you'll go?",
  "32828": "Under the bed, are you, hussy?",
  "32829": "Have no society, no neighbors?",
  "32830": "And if I do my duty and do right, you will sustain me, will you not?",
  "32831": "Perhaps he condoles with me, does he?",
  "32832": "Who are these builded for, my son?",
  "32833": "Affords this art no greater miracle?",
  "32834": "Well, then, what do you propose to do?",
  "32835": "You saw the lady fall?",
  "32836": "Do you think as it could be a rabbit?",
  "32837": "But how did you get to work again?",
  "32838": "Would it not, moreover, be much more easy for him to gain his daughter, if he did all in his power to forward his father's views?",
  "32839": "And in what way does he who thinks that wisdom is the discernment of the tempers and tastes of the motley multitude, whether in painting or music, or, finally, in politics, differ from him whom I have been describing?",
  "32840": "What man could be more lovable than such a man as would grow from such a boy?",
  "32841": "Why should not we also enjoy an original relation to the universe?",
  "32842": "Are you thinking I'm safe?",
  "32843": "Well, what of it?",
  "32844": "What's he up to now, I wonder?",
  "32845": "What do you keep on doing it for?",
  "32846": "Did you receive the despatch?",
  "32847": "He is living?",
  "32848": "Shall I really tell you?",
  "32849": "What will our friends think of us, who may chance to be upon the street and witness our frivolous antics?",
  "32850": "Or a subjugator?",
  "32851": "How long have you been married?",
  "32852": "Yet who is there does not sometimes hazard it for the enjoyment of an hour?",
  "32853": "Now for what, my dear friend?",
  "32854": "You will promise me that, at any rate?",
  "32855": "What was their languid grace but the softness of chambering?",
  "32856": "Was it not natural that, in the indignation excited by their wrongs, they should turn to the man who had laid the axe to the root of the tree which bore such fruit, and at least consider the possibility of profiting by his work?",
  "32857": "Could I count them on my fingers?",
  "32858": "May I come in?",
  "32859": "Are you for the rich or for the poor?",
  "32860": "Whose is he?",
  "32861": "Who has been telling you about him?",
  "32862": "Have you nothing else to tell him?",
  "32863": "Worse?",
  "32864": "What would the best of us be if he were suddenly placed at war with the whole world?",
  "32865": "Who is your man?",
  "32866": "Where is he now?",
  "32867": "What are you bothering for?",
  "32868": "Do you seek any guidance from me?",
  "32869": "How on earth should she talk of any one else as long as you are here?",
  "32870": "And a narrative it remains both in the speeches which the poet recites from time to time and in the intermediate passages?",
  "32871": "And others say even that the external world is the work of our organs?",
  "32872": "Am I sorry?",
  "32873": "And, indeed, unless this shoal had a machine in its stomach, how could it change its position with such astonishing rapidity?",
  "32874": "Could the prisoners see each other?",
  "32875": "But why do you ask?",
  "32876": "Are you quite sure, then, that you WILL come to see him often?",
  "32877": "Till then, will you be one, sir?",
  "32878": "And will you undertake to deliver it?",
  "32879": "Well, did you like it?",
  "32880": "Where is my aunt?",
  "32881": "You are horrified?",
  "32882": "Who can say where the dominion of mind over matter ceases?",
  "32883": "But if you think all servitude intolerable, to what purpose serve your complaint against your particular governors?",
  "32884": "If he were so delighted by my visit, why had he not crossed the lawn at once as soon as he saw the car?",
  "32885": "What odds then?",
  "32886": "But what shall it be?",
  "32887": "What do you think of that for a kite?",
  "32888": "Oh, it comes out, then, in the photograph?",
  "32889": "Who denies it?",
  "32890": "Will you give me some money?",
  "32891": "Do you love me so much, then?",
  "32892": "Were you there?",
  "32893": "Why so dull and mute, young sinner?",
  "32894": "But he paid your ransom?",
  "32895": "And how is your sister?",
  "32896": "Whear the divil?",
  "32897": "When you shall have taken this money back to your prince, what advice will you give him?",
  "32898": "Is that the way you talk?",
  "32899": "Where the baker who, retiring from business, leaves his customers and his establishment to his assistants?",
  "32900": "Well what is WHOM?",
  "32901": "No bad?",
  "32902": "How can they be helped, mama?",
  "32903": "And is not their humanity to the condemned in some cases quite charming?",
  "32904": "Is it not because they have not enough at home wherewith to fill their bellies and their pokes?",
  "32905": "You suppose they really TALK of them?",
  "32906": "Do you know, my husband, why I came here?",
  "32907": "What, was it conscience then?",
  "32908": "Why has fate given you two such splendid children?",
  "32909": "It is a good sight to see, I suppose?",
  "32910": "Salted them on me?",
  "32911": "What are you by trade?",
  "32912": "Now, are you ready?",
  "32913": "I wanted to know if, loving her and wishing her happiness, you would consider it good for her to marry me?",
  "32914": "Where are you bound?",
  "32915": "Has he been moved?",
  "32916": "Or shall we not establish our equality in this manner?",
  "32917": "Why had he come to this house?",
  "32918": "What are you going on in this way at me for?",
  "32919": "And if that is true, what sort of general must he have been?",
  "32920": "What's the case now?",
  "32921": "Why may I not rest me from this restlessness and sleep from this wide waking?",
  "32922": "And do you know this gentleman, monsieur?",
  "32923": "Presently?",
  "32924": "Then I have been your property, have I?",
  "32925": "Is that really the case?",
  "32926": "Are the passes open?",
  "32927": "To go to the bottom?",
  "32928": "If you are going into the operations of commerce who will look after the government?",
  "32929": "What strength had I to dart retaliation at my antagonist?",
  "32930": "Have you seen him?",
  "32931": "And why should we have done it?",
  "32932": "Do you hear that flourish of trumpets?",
  "32933": "How long shall I be your victim?",
  "32934": "What on earth put that into her head?",
  "32935": "And when shall you come back again?",
  "32936": "You say the affair was decisive?",
  "32937": "And how did he make his money?",
  "32938": "Mamma?",
  "32939": "What do you expect me to do?",
  "32940": "Who do you suppose, my dear?",
  "32941": "About my what?",
  "32942": "So you understand the whole position of our troops?",
  "32943": "How want of love tormenteth?",
  "32944": "What became of this little boy?",

  "32947": "?",
  "32948": "Are you going to sit snoring there, all day?",
  "32949": "Does he mean that?",
  "32950": "But what do we do?",
  "32951": "You have no doubt of their reality?",
  "32952": "Is my father here?",
  "32953": "You still bear in mind what it means?",
  "32954": "And there you sit, I suppose, all the day long, eh?",
  "32955": "Why, as to improvements, magnify the evil, and stoutly refuse to see any good in them?",
  "32956": "From the earth, in the sky?",
  "32957": "If you shall be a cuckold?",
  "32958": "And the unjust man will strive and struggle to obtain more than the unjust man or action, in order that he may have more than all?",
  "32959": "Why did not you kick him out, and let her in, and say I'll be an honest wife and a noble woman from this hour?",
  "32960": "What, all five out at once?",
  "32961": "Do you think that there is anything so very unnatural or inexcusable in their case?",
  "32962": "What else should I have done?",
  "32963": "And know you the news?",
  "32964": "As lovely as WHO?",
  "32965": "What route must we take?",
  "32966": "And not play too?",
  "32967": "What did she say?",
  "32968": "Was the skull nailed to the limb with the face outwards, or with the face to the limb?",
  "32969": "Could you decide now?",
  "32970": "Made to be amused only?",
  "32971": "And what other wretchedness would come to him?",
  "32972": "You have never heard of papa, I suppose?",
  "32973": "What's to become of you out here?",
  "32974": "Where is he then?",
  "32975": "Now what horrible thing can have happened?",
  "32976": "What has he heard?",
  "32977": "We are both undone, and what better are we for our being reconciled together, seeing we have nothing to live on?",
  "32978": "Should he sacrifice more men, with so few chances of saving those already sacrificed?",
  "32979": "Have you not yourself already had the same fear?",
  "32980": "Have the men taken cover?",
  "32981": "Does he weep?",
  "32982": "Are they all brothers, sir?",

  "32991": "How can we be reconciled?",
  "32992": "Shall I marry and settle down?",
  "32993": "But was he ill?",
  "32994": "How, indeed, could a lasting concord be maintained by two such disparate characters?",
  "32995": "Is THAT spiritual, her bullying, her conceit, her sordid materialism?",
  "32996": "Is?",
  "32997": "Would he be regarded as any the less a renegade from all parties?",
  "32998": "Parley?",

  "33016": "I go out?",
  "33017": "Where was this coach, in the name of gracious?",
  "33018": "With what day shall I begin?",

  "33808": "But nobody possesses it, so what would you have?",
  "33809": "You have made it up?",
  "33810": "When is it to be done?",
  "33811": "How, then, could they provide for themselves, and when had they time to plough and sow their fields?",
  "33812": "Was her husband, to whom it legally belonged, to make it over to her as a free gift?",
  "33813": "Is what you hear at church, religion?",
  "33814": "And what enlargement do you expect to obtain in this way?",
  "33815": "Plans?",
  "33816": "What might be the consequences?",
  "33817": "Would she have pitied him had she seen him?",
  "33818": "Aronnax?",
  "33819": "In your own heart, do you feel quite certain?",
  "33820": "Or you, my lords, to be my followers?",
  "33821": "It is true?",
  "33822": "Then in time of peace justice will be of no use?",
  "33823": "But how could you guess what the motive was?",
  "33824": "What did you think of that?",
  "33825": "When will you come?",
  "33826": "Is it possible, then, to love, if you are not loved?",
  "33827": "Will you be her servants?",
  "33828": "Would she never issue from it?",
  "33829": "There's nothing wrong?",
  "33830": "NOT a party in anything, ma'am?",
  "33831": "Have I cut my heart into a demd extraordinary number of little pieces, and given them all away, one after another, to the same little engrossing demnition captivater, and can I live to be suspected by her?",
  "33832": "Then what?",
  "33833": "Supper?",
  "33834": "Can anyone do much for anyone else unless by making a will in his favour and dying then and there?",
  "33835": "Did we not leave her, but just now?",
  "33836": "Then?",
  "33837": "Has anything worried you?",
  "33838": "And who shall then stick closest to ye, and excite others?",
  "33839": "Can I rely upon you?",
  "33840": "Oh, you are the young feller who did that poster?",
  "33841": "Do you know of any houses?",
  "33842": "Do you mean to say that this slip of paper will help us?",
  "33843": "What identity?",
  "33844": "Did you bring the things I mentioned?",
  "33845": "But, my lord, if there be no secret of penitence, will the director consent to my being here?",
  "33846": "Do you have a faith, or a knowledge, you follow, which helps you to live and to do right?",
  "33847": "Is not this what we would have all men do to us?",
  "33848": "You hussy, how dare you talk in that way?",
  "33849": "Now, what shall we do?",
  "33850": "Which should it be?",
  "33851": "Will you follow me?",
  "33852": "What else can I do?",
  "33853": "How would you like to come into a house and find everyone muttering to themselves?",
  "33854": "And can the just by justice make men unjust, or speaking general can the good by virtue make them bad?",
  "33855": "You're sure?",
  "33856": "Are we to see profound wisdom in this?",
  "33857": "Is it not, said she, whispering her husband in his ear, is it not a noble nose?",
  "33858": "Who'll keep THEM quiet?",
  "33859": "Had any difference arisen between him and her papa?",
  "33860": "And what shall I?",
  "33861": "Not so much so?",
  "33862": "You are fond of it?",
  "33863": "May I see it?",
  "33864": "Tell me, do you know what the countess, for whose pardon you are beseeching me, has done?",
  "33865": "Had she not openly avowed her intention of marrying for money if she ever had the chance?",
  "33866": "That the boy may sink and perish?",
  "33867": "Whose there?",
  "33868": "Been there long?",
  "33869": "Which is the way?",
  "33870": "Or his starch'd beard?",
  "33871": "Who knows what may be in store for you yet?",
  "33872": "By this?",
  "33873": "And not long?",
  "33874": "Is that certain?",
  "33875": "Are you asleep?",
  "33876": "Any ideas?",
  "33877": "Have we been deceived by an illusion?",
  "33878": "Was it physical?",
  "33879": "Caution?",
  "33880": "Did not you know that, my dear lord?",
  "33881": "Did not your friend here look like me?",
  "33882": "What are you rattling in there?",
  "33883": "But again, will they tell us that such a nature, placed under favourable circumstances, will not be perfectly good and wise if any ever was?",
  "33884": "Has not one of you a cross?",
  "33885": "And what does the judge affirm to be the life which is next, and the pleasure which is next?",
  "33886": "Was my uncle stark mad?",
  "33887": "Or have we found angels in the forms of kings to govern him?",
  "33888": "More in your brains than in your pocket, eh?",
  "33889": "He has come, then, as they told me?",
  "33890": "The only unofficial detective?",
  "33891": "Have you had lunch yet?",
  "33892": "Far from here?",
  "33893": "Whither is it carrying me?",
  "33894": "And where are they looking for her?",
  "33895": "Who told you this?",
  "33896": "Of what was he thinking?",
  "33897": "Do you think it is too much?",
  "33898": "D'you remember you were rather sniffy about meeting him?",
  "33899": "Is that what you wished to say?",
  "33900": "How much of the ballast of conservatism and of loyalty to tradition is it well to throw overboard in the interest of accelerated motion?",
  "33901": "Shall a similar end be pursued for the ethical purpose of widening the circle of those who shall live and be happy?",
  "33902": "Why have they not seized me?",
  "33903": "When did it happen and what has happened?",
  "33904": "You see?",
  "33905": "How could we like a people who treated us so unjustly?",
  "33906": "When shall the day come when we shall lift our hands?",
  "33907": "Are you then making a thesis?",
  "33908": "Would you like me to bring some rice?",
  "33909": "Who do you want?",
  "33910": "How did he get 'em?",
  "33911": "And is my life to be forfeit, is some terrible punishment to come on my poor old head for that which I cannot help?",
  "33912": "You will be frank with me?",
  "33913": "And was that the head and front of his offending?",
  "33914": "And must he not be represented as such?",
  "33915": "But what's he doing here?",
  "33916": "While he indulged himself in this state, amidst a profound silence, the curate, approaching him with great reverence, asked him if he would not be pleased to honour him with his company at dinner?",
  "33917": "He said nothing more?",
  "33918": "And even if he has done wrong, how do I know that he has not condemned himself?",
  "33919": "And do they give you frogs to eat, so's to make you limber?",
  "33920": "A doctor?",
  "33921": "What did you do?",
  "33922": "Would he allow imitation to be the ruling principle of his life, as if he had nothing higher in him?",
  "33923": "That's what you tell this gentleman too, is it?",
  "33924": "He's your husband, eh?",
  "33925": "Can I spare him?",
  "33926": "What now?",
  "33927": "Armed?",
  "33928": "Or may not all three be properly allotted to it?",
  "33929": "Anything up?",
  "33930": "Is that so?",
  "33931": "You do not wish to hear it, perhaps?",
  "33932": "What does it matter to me?",
  "33933": "And will not a true astronomer have the same feeling when he looks at the movements of the stars?",
  "33934": "Why, what else are they?",
  "33935": "And s'pose he steps in here any minute, and sings out my name before I can throw him a wink to keep quiet?",
  "33936": "And the just is the good?",
  "33937": "How have I deviated from those principles, monsieur?",
  "33938": "But why FOUR pounds?",
  "33939": "And what did you find?",
  "33940": "What has he come here for?",
  "33941": "Are you inside?",
  "33942": "Downright?",
  "33943": "Do you think she'll miss you?",
  "33944": "Why was it necessary to weave the queen into this gloomy web of guilt and crime?",
  "33945": "I suppose that is why you live in town?",
  "33946": "What was the result of that memorable expedition?",
  "33947": "What, then, is the defence?",
  "33948": "What do you mean by risk?",
  "33949": "What would be the use?",
  "33950": "How could she make such nails work?",
  "33951": "Am I not the wife of my husband?",
  "33952": "What came after?",
  "33953": "Supposing her to be as good a woman as any you can find, which she certainly is not, why do you wish to connect yourself with anybody at present?",
  "33954": "What is the proposition?",
  "33955": "So?",
  "33956": "How is the snatchblatch?",
  "33957": "Just?",
  "33958": "Did you hear anything of it when you were in those parts?",
  "33959": "What is in this?",
  "33960": "And through what deplorable madness had she thus ruined her life by continual sacrifices?",
  "33961": "Where are the marks of its fangs?",
  "33962": "What d'you say to having something to eat?",
  "33963": "Who was this novice in war with the effrontery of a luminary?",
  "33964": "In my precinct?",
  "33965": "Is she, my lord?",
  "33966": "May this young lady go with us?",
  "33967": "Has no one come to seek her in this land?",
  "33968": "Then you'll be free?",
  "33969": "Monseigneur?",
  "33970": "Is it not sad?",
  "33971": "Can people enchant each other too much, cajole each other too much, charm each other too much?",
  "33972": "Why do they grease the axles of the wheels?",
  "33973": "If there be doubt as to which of our divisions will get our candidate, is there no doubt as to which of your candidates will get your party?",
  "33974": "What did you take me to your mother for?",
  "33975": "And did they ask you to make a speech?",
  "33976": "Some such object it was, that induced you to call on me?",
  "33977": "But how about money?",
  "33978": "You here at this hour?",
  "33979": "Well, then, was it this eye or that through which you dropped the beetle?",
  "33980": "What did your excellency say?",
  "33981": "Will you then swear to me, that you will never, under any pretext, and from any motive whatsoever, betray to anybody, so much as a single word of what I am now about to tell you?",
  "33982": "Where are you going, you rascal?",
  "33983": "Do you know, my friends, what that plain, seen from the height we are at, resembles?",
  "33984": "What was the good of bringing him?",
  "33985": "Where was it?",
  "33986": "Would she be decent to him, or would she scold him?",
  "33987": "Which is the best wish to wish him?",
  "33988": "How CAN you say 'I am happier,' and nothing changed?",
  "33989": "Why sadden the poor children, and damp their newly cherished hopes?",
  "33990": "And you feel convinced that you must break with him?",
  "33991": "Alone, where?",
  "33992": "And you saw him frequently?",
  "33993": "Why is she so glad?",
  "33994": "But why do you ask?",
  "33995": "What new treasures lay here for science to unfold?",
  "33996": "Rochester?",
  "33997": "What's coming on?",
  "33998": "Are we to wonder, then, if here and there we find in his works an offensive expression?",
  "33999": "Why not cut it?",
  "34000": "What does the letter mean, mother?",
  "34001": "Are we rising into a fiery furnace?",
  "34002": "What substances will you proscribe?",
  "34003": "And what method of surveillance do you employ?",
  "34004": "Oh, well, as it were, what?",
  "34005": "You think so?",
  "34006": "Of how much?",
  "34007": "But we could not prevent it, could we?",
  "34008": "You get your percentage out o' the purchase, I suppose?",
  "34009": "Food enough for all?",
  "34010": "On the other hand, would he not, by remaining to meet a fate almost inevitable, incur the guilt of suicide?",
  "34011": "Has she told you she likes me much?",
  "34012": "Why should I envy them?",
  "34013": "What did he say to you?",
  "34014": "But if he were taken back again he would imagine, and truly imagine, that he was descending?",
  "34015": "My friend, my friend, why thus grieve me?",
  "34016": "How does that strike you?",
  "34017": "Forty pounds?",
  "34018": "But I mean another piece?",
  "34019": "Are all voters enlightened?",
  "34020": "And his level, whether higher or lower, could it possibly be the same as hers?",
  "34021": "What makes you so sure?",
  "34022": "What is it in the nature of the oak that causes it to send its root down into the soil and to drink up of its substance?",
  "34023": "What's he going to read?",
  "34024": "Where shall I go?",
  "34025": "Are then at this time the revolutions of the heavens, the constellations of the firmament, and aspects of the planets such, that whosoever shall lose a hatchet shall immediately grow rich?",
  "34026": "What was the primitive tissue?",
  "34027": "How much do you pay a week?",
  "34028": "And he is named?",
  "34029": "How came you by the knowledge?",
  "34030": "Why not win to freedom?",
  "34031": "Does he?",
  "34032": "And if not in the worst, why is it to follow at all?",
  "34033": "What, pray?",
  "34034": "Wherefore?",
  "34035": "Shall I be that?",
  "34036": "And what shall we say of such things as religious duties, of cheerfulness, of good manners, of personal cleanliness?",
  "34037": "Or, have you been a bad steward to yourself, and wasted your property in lawsuits and the like?",
  "34038": "Ah, who put it up?",
  "34039": "But light?",
  "34040": "What has opened her eyes?",
  "34041": "Do you want him?",
  "34042": "And would you indeed damn your precious soul?",
  "34043": "Well, did you see her safely off?",
  "34044": "But is he engaged to her?",
  "34045": "Why, how are all the folks at home?",
  "34046": "Are these persons, then, so rich and powerful?",
  "34047": "Can it give heat to a dead body?",
  "34048": "Where's the use of looking nice, when no one sees me but those cross midgets, and no one cares whether I'm pretty or not?",
  "34049": "And the king has seen the cardinal?",
  "34050": "Detain him?",
  "34051": "And return to life, if there be such a thing, is the birth of the dead into the world of the living?",
  "34052": "Or do you also hate the duke your husband?",
  "34053": "Do you know who it is from?",
  "34054": "Have you been to the opera?",
  "34055": "Not a word to your loving mother, who was growing older too?",
  "34056": "Would you be at ease, and feel that you had played an open part?",
  "34057": "Has your majesty no other orders to give me?",
  "34058": "But what are you going to do with him, now he is alive?",
  "34059": "And what shall I do when papa and you leave me, and I am by myself?",
  "34060": "Why is he sleeping there?",
  "34061": "Had he not told her, yes, told her to make a list, and not to admit anyone who was not on that list?",
  "34062": "Were her fears realized?",
  "34063": "I suppose it bowled the poor blighter over absolutely?",
  "34064": "Who introduced this innovation?",
  "34065": "You are perhaps a tulip fancier?",
  "34066": "May I go in and look?",
  "34067": "When will we be married?",
  "34068": "You're in the habit of shaking hands?",
  "34069": "And which is wise and which is foolish?",
  "34070": "But then he had the woman he loved still remaining?",
  "34071": "Shall I then?",
  "34072": "All ready forward?",
  "34073": "Is there any one here?",
  "34074": "But can such a head be found?",
  "34075": "And ten?",
  "34076": "Do you think if I drink water it would take off this hiccup?",
  "34077": "And this one opposite, who is this?",
  "34078": "Neither may they imitate smiths or other artificers, or oarsmen, or boatswains, or the like?",
  "34079": "You'll be ready this day week, will you?",
  "34080": "How was it possible for one poor tongue, so reviled and persecuted, so humbled, insulted, and triumphed over, to resist three tongues in league against it?",
  "34081": "What was become of them?",
  "34082": "Shall we gather strength but irresolution and inaction?",
  "34083": "And what was in the sealed iron chest?",
  "34084": "Shall I put a little more tea in the pot afore I go, ma'am?",
  "34085": "And what can you conceive more deadly?",
  "34086": "Why did you do it?",
  "34087": "What does she want?",
  "34088": "How do you know about it, and who are you, anyhow?",
  "34089": "What next?",
  "34090": "Deserted?",
  "34091": "When did you get in?",
  "34092": "Will it hit us?",
  "34093": "Do you want to be doing the same?",
  "34094": "Who will bring us bread?",
  "34095": "My friend, what do you tell me?",
  "34096": "Their whistle?",
  "34097": "Where in the world did you get that song?",
  "34098": "Is he very clever?",
  "34099": "Who did I get the statues from?",
  "34100": "Will you have some whiskey and water?",
  "34101": "What news?",
  "34102": "Struck me?",
  "34103": "And you are up?",
  "34104": "What point?",
  "34105": "What is the use of one horse for us two?",
  "34106": "The cardinal was your protector?",
  "34107": "Are the other camels better or worse than that?",
  "34108": "What two lines?",
  "34109": "At twenty minutes to nine?",
  "34110": "Whom have I to love?",
  "34111": "And the rocks with their various strata?",
  "34112": "Did I not say right?",
  "34113": "What could he, an old man, do?",
  "34114": "And now what does he do?",
  "34115": "Is he so?",
  "34116": "Then, at all events, he DID sleep here, did he?",
  "34117": "But do they really believe that at innumerable periods in the earth's history certain elemental atoms have been commanded suddenly to flash into living tissues?",
  "34118": "My name?",
  "34119": "And why should I not?",
  "34120": "How could I escape from this situation?",
  "34121": "Which was the more important, which the less important part?",
  "34122": "You call them that, too?",
  "34123": "But by what means?",
  "34124": "Not come yet?",
  "34125": "Ever hear of lones the packer, hey, ole chappie?",
  "34126": "Is it quite original?",
  "34127": "Did he do that?",
  "34128": "Why should he trust himself to a balloon, that would blaze up like a piece of paper?",
  "34129": "You saw it?",
  "34130": "Like him?",
  "34131": "Would you take a seat, sir?",
  "34132": "And yet what else am I to do?",
  "34133": "Well, have you heard from your husband lately, my dear?",
  "34134": "You refused him?",
  "34135": "How did you know that?",
  "34136": "Can she make your real flecky paste, as melts in your mouth, and lies all up like a puff?",
  "34137": "Yes, what is it?",
  "34138": "Should he stay at home with her, her mother and her sisters?",
  "34139": "What can I do to prevent it?",
  "34140": "Have been brought together, eh?",
  "34141": "Would you like to come up and see her?",
  "34142": "What would you like to do tomorrow?",
  "34143": "Will that arrangement suit you?",
  "34144": "And you shall be included in it, in our happiness, do you hear, father?",
  "34145": "FLOATED?",
  "34146": "Have you eaten anything?",
  "34147": "How d'you know I want to travel?",
  "34148": "Did she feel as he did?",
  "34149": "Water to drink?",
  "34150": "You will not serve me, sir, will you?",
  "34151": "How should he be?",
  "34152": "Again, has he greater experience of the pleasures of honour, or the lover of honour of the pleasures of wisdom?",
  "34153": "Is it nothing to hold one's peace?",
  "34154": "And you can do nothing until then?",
  "34155": "When, where?",
  "34156": "Is there generally?",
  "34157": "Yes, but still all this has to be looked after, and who is there to look after it?",
  "34158": "How much will you give me for it?",
  "34159": "What have I to say to them?",
  "34160": "When are you coming back?",
  "34161": "Can anyone be surprised if one gets fond of such a ship?",
  "34162": "Oh, not her?",
  "34163": "If the loyal people united were put to the utmost of their strength by the rebellion, must they not fail when divided and partially paralyzed by a political war among themselves?",
  "34164": "But what is worship?",
  "34165": "Why do you not speak to me?",
  "34166": "In arms against me?",
  "34167": "Do you wish for a proof?",
  "34168": "Where, then?",
  "34169": "Prove?",
  "34170": "Little woman?",
  "34171": "Shall it be said, good reader?",
  "34172": "Are you glad to leave us, dear?",
  "34173": "What had that harsh tyrant of hers done that was good or serviceable for her?",
  "34174": "And the mistress?",
  "34175": "Can one be well while suffering morally?",
  "34176": "Where would be that thrill if I had been as definite as a timetable?",
  "34177": "How long otherwise?",
  "34178": "Tony, where are you going, my charmer?",
  "34179": "What does this tell us?",
  "34180": "How does she use you?",
  "34181": "Have you nothing else to ask him, sir?",
  "34182": "In the nick of time?",
  "34183": "How?",
  "34184": "Mind it?",
  "34185": "How can I help myself?",
  "34186": "Where has he gone?",
  "34187": "That visit not succeeding either, you will go again perhaps?",
  "34188": "Husband, are you as kind and gentle toward your wife as you should be?",
  "34189": "For what is death?",
  "34190": "If I see, clearly see, that ladder leading from plant to man, why should I suppose it breaks off at me and does not go farther and farther?",
  "34191": "Lively?",
  "34192": "Another glass?",
  "34193": "But the great point is, is there a 'Rita' on the list?",
  "34194": "Why should he not try rather to fortify himself, to add to his courtiers, to continually obtain new subsidies, and finally to free himself from dependence on the people, the inevitable goal of all power originating in the people?",
  "34195": "What was the difference whether the alms were given into my hands or into my wife's?",
  "34196": "Do you tell me that the woman is dead?",
  "34197": "Did he take that medicine, men?",
  "34198": "Who would suppose it?",

  "34305": "Where do the lord and lady sleep?",
  "34306": "But whither am I wandering?",
  "34307": "With what kind of order?",
  "34308": "Why, then, refuse to follow to the end the road opened by science, and to admit an hypothesis which is the inevitable result of experience itself?",
  "34309": "But do you think we shall find the count at home?",
  "34310": "And what I am, to you my friends, now am I not?",
  "34311": "Do you conceive any thing but merely that perception?",
  "34312": "Who are these men you have brought before us?",
  "34313": "Some one holds you in restraint?",
  "34314": "Did you think he came directly from town?",

  "34330": "Or what hopes have we of deliverance by thus continuing faithful to such wicked wretches?",
  "34331": "Who's accused you?",
  "34332": "What's one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one?",
  "34333": "But the question again recurs, upon what pretense could he be put in possession of a force of that magnitude in time of peace?",
  "34334": "What can I do for the son?",
  "34335": "What, after the last?",
  "34336": "That I might lose them?",
  "34337": "Who is my mother?",
  "34338": "Why not let me send for this pleasant lady?",
  "34339": "Where have you come from?",

  "34343": "Had she no tears for the rough friend who laughed at the silk shoes, and taught her how to hold the reins and never fear that the old pony would run away with her?",
  "34344": "Where could my uncle be at that moment?",
  "34345": "Does he not want anything else?",
  "34346": "Why should I guard me?",
  "34347": "What am I to say or to do to make you understand that my only idea of happiness is the idea that sooner or later I may get you to be my wife?",
  "34348": "Why did he not tell it?",
  "34349": "What was the reply?",
  "34350": "Did business men commonly go into an expenditure of money which could be of no account to them?",
  "34351": "And then, in the next place, was it probable that the dean would act upon such a letter by filling up the vacancy, even if he did get it?",
  "34352": "And if not, WHO IS IN THE ROOM besides you and me?",
  "34353": "Must it of necessity be admitted that this power is infringed, so long as a part of the old articles remain?",
  "34354": "Had any papers been handed about among them, similar to these lists?",
  "34355": "Shall I go?",
  "34356": "On what charge do you expect to be arrested?",
  "34357": "But what can we expect from a turnip?",
  "34358": "And what am I now?",
  "34359": "A widow, ma'am?",
  "34360": "Well, what happened when you did get there?",
  "34361": "You say two faces were familiar to you?",
  "34362": "You opened the letter?",
  "34363": "But what are all these birds doing in heaven?",
  "34364": "Is this, also, some enchanted person?",
  "34365": "But what was it?",
  "34366": "I mean to say, what?",
  "34367": "Ha, friend?",
  "34368": "And what about his wife and family?",
  "34369": "Is it necessary that a bourgeoisie which stands in such need of you should disown you?",
  "34370": "Suppose he were taken prisoner again?",
  "34371": "Now, my good fellow, how are you?",
  "34372": "She was about to say?",
  "34373": "Do you have a teaching?",
  "34374": "Has labor, once so fecund, likewise become sterile?",
  "34375": "Then what do you talk of?",
  "34376": "A signal for others?",
  "34377": "Who, and what are you?",
  "34378": "What then is that which is able to conduct a man?",
  "34379": "Well, what are these buildings?",
  "34380": "What does he want to go out for again?",
  "34381": "You know that great pause that comes upon things before the dusk?",
  "34382": "You wish me, then, to relate the history of my past sorrows?",
  "34383": "What the charm that floats the bowl?",
  "34384": "When did that happen?",
  "34385": "Are you sure they can be relied on?",
  "34386": "What will come of it all?",
  "34387": "Was there any mention made of my uncle or me?",
  "34388": "In what does it consist?",
  "34389": "Then I am not to be allowed to have anything to do with it officially?",
  "34390": "Can I go, can I go?",
  "34391": "Is she a friend of yours?",
  "34392": "Or will you be my friend, as you have been hitherto, and do what I request?",
  "34393": "Do you mean it?",
  "34394": "What is that queer concern going down the river?",
  "34395": "Was that all she said I said?",
  "34396": "But how cast off all the superfluous, devilish burden of my outer man?",
  "34397": "Why then is that rather a misfortune than this a good fortune?",
  "34398": "There now, what is it?",
  "34399": "Anything in the gruff and grumble way?",
  "34400": "Oh, my father, must your past career always interfere with my successes?",
  "34401": "Have I furnished it nicely?",
  "34402": "What am I doing here, anyway?",
  "34403": "From what causes do I derive my existence, and to what condition shall I return?",
  "34404": "Who put that paper there?",
  "34405": "Will you tell me what you're going to do with the skin?",
  "34406": "Do you suppose I am going to bring my ropes, my windlass, and set it up, and go down there with my boy and let myself be bitten, perhaps, by your cursed dog for the pleasure of giving it back to you?",
  "34407": "What will you do, then?",
  "34408": "What sort of a life could we build on such foundations?",
  "34409": "Ay, said I, but who can help constitution?",
  "34410": "Not chilled, pet, are you?",
  "34411": "Gone?",
  "34412": "Where had you seen me before?",
  "34413": "And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a fait accompli?",
  "34414": "And to sign the contract in three days?",
  "34415": "Could it be that the unfortunate man had committed suicide, overcome by his troubles?",
  "34416": "And that is your opinion?",
  "34417": "Can one?",
  "34418": "Was it wonderful that I was misanthropic and sullen?",
  "34419": "Who compels me to this?",
  "34420": "What had she done?",
  "34421": "Do you love him?",
  "34422": "Not even by lightening it, as they lighten an overloaded vessel?",
  "34423": "Is there any other witness?",
  "34424": "Do you think I am so poor and short of clothes, or that I have so few cloaks and as to be unable to find comfortable beds both for myself and for my guests?",
  "34425": "Meg, shall we ever learn to talk less?",
  "34426": "What then, when that's once done?",
  "34427": "Then why did you come here, my dear?",
  "34428": "Why should my courtesie to these knights go all for naught?",
  "34429": "Was I, then, a monster, a blot upon the earth, from which all men fled and whom all men disowned?",
  "34430": "Could the latter for a moment suppose that the son would not offer the best part to the father?",
  "34431": "Why should she be sorry?",
  "34432": "Who, then, has counselled you to take this step, one for which the court is deeply indebted to you, and which is perfectly natural, considering your birth and your misfortunes?",
  "34433": "And so?",
  "34434": "Seek introductions, draw petitions up?",
  "34435": "How do we know what is at the bottom of his sudden interest in you?",
  "34436": "Wherefore?",
  "34437": "How do you account for this?",
  "34438": "And on what occasions have such favors been bestowed upon you?",
  "34439": "Do you think that will be really necessary?",
  "34440": "Any other letters?",
  "34441": "And where the prudence now that awed mankind?",
  "34442": "What will the ladies take for breakfast?",
  "34443": "Where did you learn how I speak of others?",
  "34444": "Does it hurt you so much?",
  "34445": "You are not angry with me?",
  "34446": "What if her interest in him were not so entirely that of a relative as it had formerly been?",
  "34447": "Did you see them off, before you came away?",
  "34448": "What on earth are we to do with him?",
  "34449": "Does it consist in the greater security afforded by a greater variety of parties, against the event of any one party being able to outnumber and oppress the rest?",
  "34450": "Should you like to sleep?",
  "34451": "Why, it may be asked, has the supposed creative force produced bats and no other mammals on remote islands?",
  "34452": "Should he not have a regard for his health and efficiency?",
  "34453": "Shall I tell you each ornament of your toilet?",
  "34454": "How does he get it, then?",
  "34455": "Can it be believed that they would thus act to no purpose during their courtship?",
  "34456": "How know you this man has?",
  "34457": "Was there ever such a sober, sentimental interview?",
  "34458": "And as it is to so go at all events, may we not agree that the sooner the better?",
  "34459": "Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?",
  "34460": "And why were you not willing?",
  "34461": "Are you so and so?",
  "34462": "May I suppose that you have this distinction of the visible and intelligible fixed in your mind?",
  "34463": "What's the good of getting away?",
  "34464": "Is it not adherence to the old and tried, against the new and untried?",
  "34465": "What can I do?",
  "34466": "Are or are not our interests conflicting?",
  "34467": "And by whom were they recommended to you?",
  "34468": "Paid according to the labor that they had performed, of what could they complain?",
  "34469": "And if it is proper to demand proof that justice should be done and the truth spoken, why may one not demand proof that men should be prudent and benevolent?",
  "34470": "What would his guards think if they heard him shout like a madman?",
  "34471": "How about the lion and the lioness?",
  "34472": "Does the reader wish to know where the majority of the songs of the galleys, those refrains called in the special vocabulary lirlonfa, have had their birth?",
  "34473": "Had they been heard?",
  "34474": "You are pleased it is a girl?",
  "34475": "Why should not schools be established, a comfortable hotel be erected, a church be built?",
  "34476": "What the devil is the meaning of all this?",
  "34477": "I suppose your people will be here to meet you?",
  "34478": "What could hinder the poor canoe, followed by sea and watched from the shore, from succumbing before the end of the day?",

  "34480": "When will he be able to be moved?",
  "34481": "What is the matter, then?",
  "34482": "Then this child is not yours?",
  "34483": "What is to be done, then?",
  "34484": "Are you on public, or private business?",
  "34485": "But why did you change your purpose?",
  "34486": "What branch of human affairs is there in which these sparks of individual spirit have not made their appearance, surmounting all formal considerations?",

  "34489": "That one?",
  "34490": "Was there an accident?",
  "34491": "May it be?",
  "34492": "Did I not see you trying to tear off another piece?",
  "34493": "Is it common sense, I ask you, to leave up windows which shut out all the daylight, and even confuse the eyes by throwing patches of colour, to which I should be hard put to it to give a name, on a floor in which there are not two slabs on the same level?",
  "34494": "Have you a name, then?",
  "34495": "You're not getting into a state, are you?",
  "34496": "That's the boy, is it?",
  "34497": "But did you ever like knocking about in such discomfort?",
  "34498": "Where was it to come from?",
  "34499": "How did he manage it?",
  "34500": "Now then, what is it, my young woman?",
  "34501": "What can we do for you?",
  "34502": "What commission is this you give me, and what do you charge me to tell his majesty, monsieur?",
  "34503": "It's capital for us here, but what of him?",
  "34504": "Where, where?",
  "34505": "Why are you not so now?",
  "34506": "I should?",
  "34507": "What does it matter where my body happens to be?",
  "34508": "What then would be those convulsed regions upon which we were advancing, regions subject to the dire phenomena of eruptions, the offspring of volcanic explosions and subterranean convulsions?",
  "34509": "Are not you bruised, and cut over your chest and shoulders?",
  "34510": "Ask we what makes one keep, and one bestow?",
  "34511": "What song?",
  "34512": "But why so?",
  "34513": "How did you find out that?",
  "34514": "Are you sure she's married?",
  "34515": "So why should I not stay at his house?",
  "34516": "Will we play our part well?",
  "34517": "Can you not see the hint there is in the practice to such as go searching for secrets?",
  "34518": "You truly wish me to go?",
  "34519": "But then you yourself are known to others?",
  "34520": "And who thus advised you?",
  "34521": "Well, have you any news?",
  "34522": "Drunk or mad?",
  "34523": "Can you not use your eyes?",
  "34524": "Where, then, shall I look?",
  "34525": "Is it not marvelous?",
  "34526": "Is it best for you to injure your prospects for such a voluptuous, idle woman as that?",
  "34527": "But will it not be more honourable for you to begin?",
  "34528": "But what's the good of them?",

  "34533": "How's one to rent it nowadays?",
  "34534": "But which system shall be adopted?",
  "34535": "May I ask what that was?",
  "34536": "Exile yourself, did you say?",
  "34537": "What the devil does he want with me?",
  "34538": "And did you not remonstrate against such infamy?",

  "34556": "Where would he make himself a prisoner and how?",
  "34557": "Did ever anybody hear the like ?",
  "34558": "How did it come about?",
  "34559": "But who done it?",
  "34560": "What can you expect?",
  "34561": "Have you recognised him, monsieur?",
  "34562": "Must one then curse immediately, when one doth not love?",
  "34563": "And why is that?",
  "34564": "What of the hunting, hunter bold?",
  "34565": "Shall I do wrong because I am unhappy?",
  "34566": "Who's equal to the place?",
  "34567": "What is this, my dear?",
  "34568": "Was it not foolish?",
  "34569": "What would my good father say, who so strongly pointed out to me the respect due to the cardinal, if he knew I was in the society of such pagans?",
  "34570": "Must not the murmurs and doubts which these cause reach his ear?",
  "34571": "What are you doing, fellow?",
  "34572": "Do you know what your wife wants?",
  "34573": "If she be not fair to me, what care I how fair she be?",
  "34574": "And will you not torment me any more?",
  "34575": "Will any he in all the land maintain there can be two, not of one blood and birth, so marvellously twinned?",
  "34576": "Did you not hesitate for shame to mount the cart?",
  "34577": "But then, what about the other?",

  "36937": "And what will he do to us?",
  "36938": "Besides, you've enough of your own, surely?",
  "36939": "Then justice, according to your argument, is not only obedience to the interest of the stronger but the reverse?",
  "36940": "Do you really go?",
  "36941": "What restaurant?",
  "36942": "You saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?",
  "36943": "How can you do anything, unless you can spin round at once when the rein is pressed on your neck?",
  "36944": "Well, what's that to me?",
  "36945": "Does the following passage throw any light upon it?",
  "36946": "How mean you, sir, pass upon me?",
  "36947": "You mean about the man?",
  "36948": "Do you think that possible?",
  "36949": "And what do they say then?",
  "36950": "But are you under the impression that men ever do anything except for selfish reasons?",
  "36951": "Why do you ask me?",
  "36952": "What is that scratch upon the face of it?",
  "36953": "O dearest, dear sir, said I, have you nothing more to honour me with?",
  "36954": "What has he to say to his readers?",

  "37070": "And do you like it here?",
  "37071": "Shall we settle ourselves here?",
  "37072": "But of what consequence is the subject?",
  "37073": "Yes, dear?",
  "37074": "Do you mean to say that she does not love me?",

  "37108": "You live in their milieu?",
  "37109": "What have I to strive and toil for?",
  "37110": "And will you call it being against you, if the queen does not choose you for her confessor?",
  "37111": "Oh, that's this missionary?",
  "37112": "Will you disclose the whole?",
  "37113": "What's all this fuss?",
  "37114": "What ails you?",
  "37115": "How shall I moil 'em?",
  "37116": "What could sadden him thus?",
  "37117": "But could he trust himself?",
  "37118": "Is this country good for cattle?",
  "37119": "What say I?",
  "37120": "Why did they lure me there?",
  "37121": "Does he say that, papa?",
  "37122": "Do you not think that, as a daughter, I am right?",
  "37123": "How shall I go about in quest of a wight whom I know not and whom, if I saw him face to face, I should not know?",
  "37124": "Are you trying to, play pranks on an old man?",
  "37125": "Their virtue, their justice, their power?",
  "37126": "What honor has the khansamah?",
  "37127": "What, always the same ditty?",
  "37128": "Will you take advantage of this reconciliation to put down or restrain me?",
  "37129": "Can sowing begin?",
  "37130": "How am I duped?",
  "37131": "Where in this vicinity will you go and not meet some monument to inspire such sentiments?",
  "37132": "Right?",
  "37133": "And how's your friend, sir?",
  "37134": "Who are you angry with?",
  "37135": "Got stung, I daresay?",
  "37136": "And where is he now?",
  "37137": "Yes, what makes you ask?",
  "37138": "Shall we go into dinner?",
  "37139": "How did you hear that?",
  "37140": "Lynde?",
  "37141": "For of what use would this precaution be, if there were nothing to gain by it?",
  "37142": "Was she now to be as light, as foolish, as easy, as in those former days from which she had learned her wisdom?",
  "37143": "Do you think it will do?",
  "37144": "Is he glad of it or not?",
  "37145": "Oh, what can I do for him?",
  "37146": "And how shall I travel, then?",
  "37147": "Oh, you agree, do you?",
  "37148": "Was he by himself?",
  "37149": "And what is it you'll say to me, and I after doing it this time in the face of all?",
  "37150": "And who's he?",
  "37151": "Does it interest you?",
  "37152": "What, my horse?",
  "37153": "Then he was certainly there?",
  "37154": "Surely your wife knew?",
  "37155": "Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?",
  "37156": "What is the reason of this sudden call?",
  "37157": "Do I find a fault, and nobody repairs it?",
  "37158": "Cried I, who carrieth his ashes unto the mountain?",
  "37159": "Is it a simple matter to keep silence?",
  "37160": "You have no faith in me?",
  "37161": "Is it any wonder that it rests with us now, with a bewildering sense of some power outside ourselves or our comprehension?",
  "37162": "How can you single out angels from among devils?",
  "37163": "Is it so very bad?",
  "37164": "Does that hurt you in any way?",
  "37165": "Shall I send the father to you?",
  "37166": "Are you quite alone, this year?",
  "37167": "Have I not given you to understand that, for a while at least, I would prefer to keep the contents of this epistle to myself?",
  "37168": "Can you say so?",
  "37169": "And here he proposed articles to you, I understand?",
  "37170": "The slab which closes the vault?",
  "37171": "How are matches made, except by bringing men and women together?",
  "37172": "Well, anyway, what ARE we going to do?",
  "37173": "But who is to carry you, said she, to your father and mother?",
  "37174": "You have nothing more to say?",
  "37175": "Who counsels best?",
  "37176": "What's the best place to stay at for the night round here?",
  "37177": "But whether made by one side or the other, would each side enjoy equal advantages on the trial?",
  "37178": "Not fear of the thunder, surely?",
  "37179": "Do you know he is a convict, a felon, a common thief?",
  "37180": "For what do they commemorate as concerns you and myself?",
  "37181": "Meaning that you saw none?",
  "37182": "Work?",
  "37183": "Were you much hurt?",
  "37184": "Do you still think you found somebody fairer?",
  "37185": "Did he steal?",
  "37186": "What stage have they reached, sir?",
  "37187": "Will no one come?",
  "37188": "Well, what?",
  "37189": "Had he a whip in his hand?",
  "37190": "When was there ever a time when he had experienced happiness, felt a true bliss?",
  "37191": "But can you not say that, sir?",
  "37192": "Why should I go back?",
  "37193": "Do you know what he did, sir?",
  "37194": "How far now can this negative mode of proceeding be carried?",
  "37195": "Why should you?",
  "37196": "And do you see that other one, who has an eagle and a dragon painted side by side upon his shield?",
  "37197": "Can I speak plainer?",
  "37198": "Who sent it?",
  "37199": "Will not a small body and a large one float the same way under the same influence?",
  "37200": "Can you give us any reason why we should not put you to death?",
  "37201": "Why had no word of any kind come from him?",
  "37202": "Made by whom?",
  "37203": "Have blows passed?",
  "37204": "And why was I so furious about it?",
  "37205": "Now, who was that someone?",
  "37206": "Who told you so?",
  "37207": "How long is this thing going on like this?",
  "37208": "How much did it cost him?",
  "37209": "How are we today?",
  "37210": "Need I recall either the scene or the national circumstances attending the occasion?",
  "37211": "You're ready, are you?",
  "37212": "Of whom speak you?",
  "37213": "Do you know?",
  "37214": "What am I saying?",
  "37215": "Might not that influence be altogether disastrous?",
  "37216": "What shall I say of this man?",
  "37217": "Is it not the impiety of the inhabitants?",
  "37218": "Was he carrying a hat?",
  "37219": "And the lustful and tyrannical desires are, as we saw, at the greatest distance?",
  "37220": "Who's there?",
  "37221": "When do you desire to go?",
  "37222": "The associate?",
  "37223": "But to whom, then?",
  "37224": "You feel strong enough to walk a little way now?",
  "37225": "What odds in that?",
  "37226": "And do you imagine he realizes all the awfulness of my position?",
  "37227": "Is the world, then, so narrow?",
  "37228": "When did music come this way?",
  "37229": "And what means have you to suggest, may I ask?",
  "37230": "What have we here?",
  "37231": "A spy?",
  "37232": "What are you worrying for, so long as he has money?",
  "37233": "Why did you ask me?",
  "37234": "What did these sealed mysterious letters bring him?",
  "37235": "How long will it take you to make up your mind?",
  "37236": "How of the window?",
  "37237": "And what did she for you?",
  "37238": "Well, how is your district council doing?",
  "37239": "Ought we not, then, to put our virtue and fortitude to the severest tests?",
  "37240": "May you come to me?",
  "37241": "What was his affair?",
  "37242": "Are you a magician?",
  "37243": "How long is it?",
  "37244": "Should you think all that pleasant enough if I forgave you?",
  "37245": "Were not these madmen common enough in such a prison?",
  "37246": "Of HIM?",
  "37247": "Is he hurt badly?",
  "37248": "What the devil is it all about?",
  "37249": "Does he now say that he did not make that promise?",
  "37250": "What was his name?",
  "37251": "Ferguson?",
  "37252": "Can it be that he was ashamed of me?",
  "37253": "Is it true, mother?",
  "37254": "Whither?",
  "37255": "Shall I open the secretary?",
  "37256": "In what respect, madame?",
  "37257": "But what is an energumen?",
  "37258": "Who is it bids me hold?",
  "37259": "May I ask where you have taken up your quarters?",
  "37260": "Or, indeed, I might perhaps get a clerkship in a merchant's office?",
  "37261": "Are you a merchant?",
  "37262": "What injury?",
  "37263": "Did I startle you?",
  "37264": "The horse?",
  "37265": "Where did you get THAT idea from?",
  "37266": "Have you ever seen a man hanged?",
  "37267": "Not even your aunt?",
  "37268": "How would it be possible to explain all this to a judge and jury, so that they might neither say that he was dishonest, nor yet that he was mad?",
  "37269": "Why did you not tell me?",
  "37270": "Do you recall her features distinctly?",
  "37271": "At such a tender age could he have been conscious of his uncle's superiority to all those who surrounded him?",
  "37272": "She had a son, that unhappy woman?",
  "37273": "What was the occasion of this excited assemblage?",
  "37274": "But at a tremendous discount, of course?",
  "37275": "You wish to speak to me about the circumstance which has just happened?",
  "37276": "Was I not just telling you I despised it?",
  "37277": "How has this been proved?",
  "37278": "Do you mind?",
  "37279": "What does it say?",
  "37280": "Then this table is free?",
  "37281": "Who raised the money?",
  "37282": "And what might you think?",
  "37283": "Perhaps you dislike it?",
  "37284": "You see all these bags at the back of my cart?",
  "37285": "Whether they were a rich or a poor corporation?",
  "37286": "And how does he behave towards travellers?",
  "37287": "Have you kept in touch with the market while you have been out of work?",
  "37288": "I then asked him what he intended to do with the knife which had been found upon him?",
  "37289": "Have you ever noticed how much a thing is heightened in value when we obtain possession of it?",
  "37290": "But why should he go through the ceremony if he is not to live with her?",
  "37291": "Oh, is that it?",
  "37292": "I do not know?",
  "37293": "And how could he know that I should be such a simpleton as to believe him?",
  "37294": "Are you so unsociable that you cannot make friends?",
  "37295": "Repeal this statute, my good sir?",
  "37296": "Will you make up your mind at last?",
  "37297": "Do I not know human nature?",
  "37298": "Must I wrap them up?",
  "37299": "If he was going to treat her like that why did he ask her to come and live at the flat?",
  "37300": "But how can I send him away, since I have given him a rendezvous?",
  "37301": "H'm?",
  "37302": "Ever so far?",
  "37303": "What are you doing there?",
  "37304": "And how have I broken that treaty, your excellency?",
  "37305": "How are you, old fellow?",
  "37306": "Sister?",
  "37307": "No misfortune has happened to the queen?",
  "37308": "You advise me, then, to be reconciled to the abbe?",
  "37309": "You too come to see them off?",
  "37310": "What is the meaning of yonder singular building?",
  "37311": "Have you brought his indentures with you?",
  "37312": "Is not ambition but an endless ladder by which no height is ever climbed till the last unreachable rung is mounted?",
  "37313": "Are you staying to talk?",
  "37314": "In what relation must she salute you as her uncle, or as her husband?",
  "37315": "Do the races or species of men, whichever term may be applied, encroach on and replace one another, so that some finally become extinct?",
  "37316": "Your crime?",
  "37317": "What have I been waiting for?",
  "37318": "Morrel?",

  "37721": "Now do you really imagine that I could have survived all these years, if I had led a public life, supposing that like a good man I had always maintained the right and had made justice, as I ought, the first thing?",
  "37722": "Who shall say?",
  "37723": "And who are the rest of them?",
  "37724": "How does it not exist, when a man risks dying a terrible death?",
  "37725": "But what could it be?",
  "37726": "He will not dare touch the treasure, will he?",
  "37727": "What good is religion if it collapses under calamity?",
  "37728": "But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject?",
  "37729": "Why should I not die if I wish?",
  "37730": "Is there anything else?",
  "37731": "Was it giddiness, or worse still, suffocation, caused by the high temperature?",
  "37732": "Is it far in the cave?",
  "37733": "But what do you want of one?",
  "37734": "That is some distance away?",
  "37735": "Am I about to do it?",
  "37736": "Is not to have lost the truth an evil, and to possess the truth a good?",
  "37737": "Who told you there was a woman here?",
  "37738": "What do these kings want in my domain?",
  "37739": "The devil take the fellow, how does he know that?",
  "37740": "How shall I prolong, according to my inclination, this recital at once so pleasing and simple?",
  "37741": "Do you remember we used to go up there?",
  "37742": "Should he make himself known to them?",
  "37743": "Would you like such a post?",
  "37744": "Why, what evil wind has blowed you here?",
  "37745": "When did you say you paid this call?",
  "37746": "You quite understand?",
  "37747": "Got any supper for a hungry man?",
  "37748": "What would you do to me?",
  "37749": "Why these churches and this singing and this humbug?",
  "37750": "Why do you speak in such a strange way?",
  "37751": "So, where, where was it?",
  "37752": "And you would like your boy's to be the same?",
  "37753": "Before the music or after?",
  "37754": "Why have I never taken part in a review?",
  "37755": "Wherefore should I beware?",
  "37756": "Is it true what the servant man said?",
  "37757": "Did you do it on your own responsibility?",
  "37758": "Will you have gold or silver?",
  "37759": "Should I not appear a most arrogant and shallow coxcomb if I gravely represented that there was any danger of her falling in love with me?",

  "37761": "What does it mean to my future?",
  "37762": "What boots it to say more?",
  "37763": "Now is there, then, no kind of oil which is capable of diminishing this friction?",
  "37764": "You have seen the stranger?",
  "37765": "Banns will do?",
  "37766": "And by whom was your wife abducted?",
  "37767": "Could you tell me to do so?",
  "37768": "What name, then, shall we give to the darkness of hell which is to last not for three days alone but for all eternity?",

  "37771": "Do you see me today?",
  "37772": "Who else could lay it there save you or me?",
  "37773": "Why would they not be gone?",
  "37774": "Or, after all, they may be in the right, and poets do really know the things about which they seem to the many to speak so well?",
  "37775": "But would any of your guardians think or speak of any other guardian as a stranger?",
  "37776": "Do you see here this little bunch, to which they are going to give t'other wrench?",
  "37777": "What do you know about it?",
  "37778": "Why, by your silence, have you unchained egoism within me?",
  "37779": "Then why are you so ruffled?",
  "37780": "And why no arrest?",
  "37781": "Is it becoming a philosopher to alter his method of reasoning, and run from one principle to its contrary, according to the particular phaenomenon, which he would explain?",
  "37782": "Where did you get that scratch?",
  "37783": "Should I, if I had a wife, suffer myself to be thus passionately carried to and fro with the stream of her humour, and neglect my deepest affairs, to serve her affections?",
  "37784": "But what do you suppose you are in the world for?",
  "37785": "Snivelling again?",
  "37786": "Three good suits, say you?",
  "37787": "Nor the general?",
  "37788": "Mina, dear what is it?",
  "37789": "How long is it now before daylight?",
  "37790": "Do you know what is done then?",
  "37791": "Is it a volcano?",
  "37792": "Have you been to look at the pictures?",
  "37793": "I do not think that this counting is constitutionally essential to the election, but how are we to proceed in the absence of it?",
  "37794": "These things happened so often at balls, and why not by the morning light, when the complexion showed all the better for it?",
  "37795": "Then you turn me away?",
  "37796": "Do you keep a journal?",
  "37797": "Does it not bear the same relation to it as the motions upon a ship to the motion of the ship itself?",
  "37798": "What is he doing here?",
  "37799": "How, said I?",
  "37800": "A special guard about the castle, in which your lodging is to be, is it not?",
  "37801": "She eats human flesh?",
  "37802": "May I venture to inquire the reason of this unexpected visit?",
  "37803": "What, will he hang himself?",
  "37804": "And the silver?",
  "37805": "How did he come to consider that he ought to be good and ought not to be bad?",
  "37806": "Secondly, will not a movement of our army be a relief to the cavalry, compelling the enemy to concentrate instead of foraging in squads everywhere?",
  "37807": "Small, what will it be?",
  "37808": "What is going to happen?",
  "37809": "What did you come for?",
  "37810": "How long did the queen remain out of the chamber?",
  "37811": "Do you accept the bargain?",
  "37812": "And we have admitted, I said, that the good of each art is specially confined to the art?",
  "37813": "And you think there was something of this sort here, do you?",
  "37814": "And she became what you called your wife?",
  "37815": "Can you blo' a harn?",
  "37816": "But what I want to know is, who shifted the carpet, and why?",
  "37817": "How on earth did you know that?",
  "37818": "Would you advise that the authority be given him?",
  "37819": "Well, and what do you think, friend?",
  "37820": "Do you not think that it is expedient to show how utterly we disregard his judgment and her malice?",
  "37821": "If the trees at moonlight sang always so harmoniously?",
  "37822": "And what are those golden rocks like when you stand under them?",
  "37823": "Or perhaps they amuse your honor?",
  "37824": "And who else save an executioner would have wished to fill that horrible office?",
  "37825": "On what will the worm feed that is never to die?",
  "37826": "Why should there be one law for men, and another for women?",
  "37827": "If we should wish to retreat, how ought we to pursue?",
  "37828": "Have you washed your hands and face this morning?",
  "37829": "I wonder if the medicine has gone through the same channels in both?",
  "37830": "What are you crying for?",
  "37831": "Then the wit going toward him, asked him what he had got in his knapsack?",
  "37832": "Is not all this obvious?",
  "37833": "Why, what is the matter?",
  "37834": "Is it a heron or a swan?",
  "37835": "Either afield or here has he been seen?",
  "37836": "Bumble?",
  "37837": "Where is my son?",
  "37838": "And, indeed, why do I relate these particular calamities?",
  "37839": "Are you foolish enough to believe that it's done for the public?",
  "37840": "Where did you grow?",
  "37841": "What's the matter with him?",
  "37842": "What will you have?",
  "37843": "Who means the smith any harm?",
  "37844": "And am I not unhappy?",
  "37845": "But the king is king, I suppose?",
  "37846": "What did you talk about?",
  "37847": "Why does the king set me at liberty?",
  "37848": "Who is there so much his country's enemy, or so unmanly, and so desirous of living, as not to repent that he is still alive?",
  "37849": "You'll hev to wait till you see your pa to reward me, then?",
  "37850": "Your own ancestors were living here before that, I suppose?",
  "37851": "Did you give my note?",
  "37852": "Where's your curls, gal?",
  "37853": "And whether you did not submit to be coughed and groaned down in the very first debate of the session, and have since made no effort to effect a reform in this respect?",
  "37854": "Did he dread, that after having touched him with his icy hand, he would still suffer him to linger upon earth?",
  "37855": "But nothing that might not be sent to a pattern young lady?",
  "37856": "How can I have the conscience to marry after having driven two women to their deaths?",
  "37857": "Why is it?",
  "37858": "We set traps, but what was the use of that, when the cargo consisted exclusively of provisions?",
  "37859": "Where did she go in?",
  "37860": "How long must you have served to claim the pension?",
  "37861": "Does she go fast?",
  "37862": "And how, pray, could due participation be obtained, if there were no removals?",
  "37863": "Thinking of more important matters, I forget where you said he lived?",
  "37864": "But what chanced next?",
  "37865": "And what were his first words?",
  "37866": "Can we conclude a treaty with the sea?",
  "37867": "Who is that tub there?",
  "37868": "Could you commission any friend of yours to bring me a pair, of you've no further use for 'em?",
  "37869": "And what are they doing, all these courtiers?",
  "37870": "Are you, sir knight, in love perchance?",
  "37871": "What does that grave smile signify?",
  "37872": "I expect you hurt yourself when you fell down?",
  "37873": "But you, I presume, have decided to assert your pretensions viva voce?",
  "37874": "Do you wish to hear what I have to say?",
  "37875": "Where the devil have the leg bands been shoved to?",
  "37876": "What became of them, deprived of the dear garden of former days, with its mazes, its odor of the past, and the graceful windings of its hedges?",
  "37877": "What be they?",
  "37878": "And as fickle?",
  "37879": "Do you know what that is?",
  "37880": "Was it indeed such spiritual guidance that was coming to me in my sleep?",
  "37881": "Are you going to spend your life saying ought, like the rest of our moralists?",
  "37882": "From what can it proceed?",
  "37883": "Whether he could go into the next street, and open a chemist's shop?",
  "37884": "Do you not perceive that the animal has the visage of a man?",
  "37885": "On whom does my bleeding heart repose?",
  "37886": "Have you any business to attend to?",
  "37887": "But he can have it again?",
  "37888": "But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that hole?",
  "37889": "With whom am I going to work the system, allow me to ask?",
  "37890": "What have you got?",
  "37891": "With respect to the employments of a soldier, a senator, and a judge, which are evidently necessary to the community, shall they be allotted to different persons, or shall the same person execute both?",
  "37892": "Who are we ourselves?",
  "37893": "Rather costly, I suppose, my dear, was it not?",
  "37894": "How could I answer her arguments?",
  "37895": "Billie?",
  "37896": "And indeed, what is there in the idea of measuring, and consequently of fixing, value, that is unscientific?",
  "37897": "And do you call a man your friend whom you have only known for eight or ten days?",
  "37898": "And what do you do, sire?",
  "37899": "I know that, fool, do I not?",
  "37900": "So, now then, who is this abbot?",
  "37901": "And not forget poor papa?",
  "37902": "You yourself came only yesterday, you say?",
  "37903": "Was it foreseen?",
  "37904": "Whom was it to?",
  "37905": "Where have you sent her to?",
  "37906": "Did he know that?",
  "37907": "And when the vault is open?",
  "37908": "Is not truth a treasure think you?",
  "37909": "You quite follow me?",
  "37910": "Did not he pay his son's debts?",
  "37911": "Do you take me for a weasel?",
  "37912": "That will cheer you, will it not?",
  "37913": "Do you know it?",
  "37914": "What is the taste of love?",
  "37915": "Why must they not look with their eyes?",

  "37918": "Shoot him?",
  "37919": "Who talks about blockheads?",
  "37920": "Only his face?",
  "37921": "Is not this the pole of the birds then?",
  "37922": "What are you going to do with yourself, my dear?",
  "37923": "Then you deny that you had anything to do with it?",
  "37924": "No offence, I hope?",
  "37925": "What ails him?",
  "37926": "To try his luck or the certainty?",
  "37927": "How many did you have out?",
  "37928": "But if there is no harm to the elements themselves in each continually changing into another, why should a man have any apprehension about the change and dissolution of all the elements?",
  "37929": "What can the fact mean?",
  "37930": "But what is it that alarms you?",
  "37931": "You must keep faith with me?",
  "37932": "In the tomb?",
  "37933": "Has this woman been relating her crimes to you?",
  "37934": "What was a hunchback?",
  "37935": "Ah, how do you do, great warrior?",
  "37936": "When do you expect to do it?",
  "37937": "Are you sure we are on the right track, lieutenant?",
  "37938": "May not the minor party possess such a superiority of pecuniary resources, of military talents and experience, or of secret succors from foreign powers, as will render it superior also in an appeal to the sword?",
  "37939": "What ideas have they been filling your head with, you young girls of today?",
  "37940": "Was it worth while to wish me to swear this morning that I would mention the appointment to no one?",
  "37941": "Or what is it commonly, that gives us any participation in it, even while alive and present, but our affection and regard to him?",
  "37942": "Could you give me the facts which prompted you to telegraph?",
  "37943": "Tib?",
  "37944": "Will you give me one of the cakes you are carrying?",
  "37945": "And no ba'dy gaieties, I suppose?",
  "37946": "And that, you think, is a bad sign?",
  "37947": "Run after?",
  "37948": "All out?",
  "37949": "Who made it to be like that, a bestial part of the body able to understand bestially and desire bestially?",
  "37950": "Does the court accompany him?",
  "37951": "Are you sure there's nothing you'll want?",
  "37952": "What's the blow now?",
  "37953": "Returning?",
  "37954": "No carriages or horses?",
  "37955": "But to what?",
  "37956": "Where do you feel bad?",
  "37957": "You must guess what I should like best, do you hear?",
  "37958": "What then is the real object of them?",
  "37959": "Is there anything else you wish to retrench or alter, gentlemen?",
  "37960": "They say you played cards with her?",
  "37961": "Who is there who has not felt all these things?",
  "37962": "Is that all, monsieur?",
  "37963": "Is there any particular feeling on that head?",
  "37964": "Shooting, sir?",
  "37965": "Misgivings as to what?",
  "37966": "Make offerings?",
  "37967": "And when I tell you that it is my business, mine of right, does that go for nothing with you?",
  "37968": "And yet you were acknowledging a little while ago that knowledge is not the same as opinion?",
  "37969": "Do you not see that society is dissolving, that a spirit of infatuation is carrying us away?",
  "37970": "Well, it's very pleasant to have you back again, and you understand all about art now, eh?",
  "37971": "And would you know what I would do unto him?",
  "37972": "You know he is your rival, do you?",
  "37973": "You do not know me?",
  "37974": "But what is there to investigate, sir?",
  "37975": "I may read this?",
  "37976": "But if he should rob you of it?",
  "37977": "Can this be death?",
  "37978": "You have heard of her, I dare say?",
  "37979": "Did he tell you so?",
  "37980": "And does the end of the world frighten you?",
  "37981": "Eustacia?",
  "37982": "What is it you'll tell?",
  "37983": "What is she thinking?",
  "37984": "Was it this voice, or at all like this voice?",
  "37985": "What was the question you put to the officer at the gate?",
  "37986": "Could we handle that dumb thing, or would it handle us?",
  "37987": "What, then, was the change which now took place?",
  "37988": "Of what other things have you got hold?",
  "37989": "Do you take it for a printed book, you ignorant fool?",
  "37990": "How could you presume to come here on such an errand, you scoundrel?",
  "37991": "You have been in the habit now of reading to your father, and those people I found you among, I dare say?",
  "37992": "What earthly right have you to use such language to me?",
  "37993": "And now what is their manner of life, and what sort of a government have they?",
  "37994": "And that one?",
  "37995": "And if we refuse?",
  "37996": "And the young should be trained in both kinds, and we begin with the false?",
  "37997": "Did you leave her pretty jolly?",
  "37998": "Or do you think that my having been unfortunate is a sufficient reason why our relative positions should be changed, and that she should command and I should obey?",
  "37999": "Do you understand what you're saying?",
  "38000": "Upon your soul?",
  "38001": "Have you a boat?",
  "38002": "How could he face her now?",
  "38003": "Could you get any?",
  "38004": "I know not whether he be truly virtuous, but why should he show readiness of the tongue?",
  "38005": "Should they have any milk?",
  "38006": "Fix'd in the heart, how can the heart forget her?",
  "38007": "That young man who was to be burned yesterday, was your son?",
  "38008": "Who can help it?",
  "38009": "How far off?",
  "38010": "For the misplaced expression?",
  "38011": "You have tied him up well, hein?",
  "38012": "Where got you that wit?",
  "38013": "Then why have you not sung before?",
  "38014": "You hear?",
  "38015": "Could she help giving her hand to the man who had won her heart?",
  "38016": "About what?",
  "38017": "Then they are saved?",
  "38018": "Why should you not be open with me?",
  "38019": "Do you remember no woman, no kind woman, who hung over you once, and kissed your lips, and called you her child?",
  "38020": "What is the use of talking of it?",
  "38021": "Where, to the launch?",
  "38022": "What do men talk about when they sit out?",
  "38023": "And who are my brethren?",
  "38024": "Who sent you?",
  "38025": "Do you drink?",
  "38026": "You only think?",
  "38027": "And when did it begin?",
  "38028": "Well, have you brought it?",
  "38029": "What are they, your excellency ?",
  "38030": "Who could tell what the future might have in reserve?",
  "38031": "But how get married?",
  "38032": "Between them?",
  "38033": "Danger?",
  "38034": "Is not the wall built strong enough, and is not the tower sufficiently strong and high?",
  "38035": "The increase of which lust in liberty, together with the present trade of the stage, in all their miscelline interludes, what learned or liberal soul doth not already abhor?",
  "38036": "What is it you are saying?",
  "38037": "Do you think he remembers me?",
  "38038": "My niece is not with you by any chance?",
  "38039": "What could I hardly be expected to undergo?",
  "38040": "Now, what must I give you to agree to this?",
  "38041": "Is it enough?",
  "38042": "A large scale map, I presume?",
  "38043": "What am I accused of?",
  "38044": "Where can he have come from?",
  "38045": "Can any one comprehend such a thing?",
  "38046": "Yours?",
  "38047": "Is he one of them, do you think?",
  "38048": "Did not that king accept of money from our king on this condition, that he should not destroy the city, and yet, contrary to the oath he had taken, he came down to burn the temple?",
  "38049": "You love me, my beautiful queen, and you will weep for me?",
  "38050": "Where am I to go?",
  "38051": "Or a drop of dew?",
  "38052": "Found your way back at last, have you?",
  "38053": "Is he a gentleman?",
  "38054": "What are their names?",
  "38055": "You're not asleep?",
  "38056": "Where are you?",
  "38057": "Indeed?",
  "38058": "Who can wonder that princes should be under such a delusion, when they are encouraged in it by the very persons who suffer from it most cruelly?",
  "38059": "I know it meets your approval?",
  "38060": "Your highness's signature?",
  "38061": "Why so many precautions?",
  "38062": "You have seen how it was fastened about my throat?",
  "38063": "Omen?",
  "38064": "How cast off?",
  "38065": "Why did I not think of bringing provisions?",
  "38066": "Gone into my house?",
  "38067": "Has her case been heard or not?",
  "38068": "Has this action of hers not set me free?",
  "38069": "Must I go?",
  "38070": "And who is there, whatever might be their former conduct, that she would think capable of such an attempt, till it were proved against them?",
  "38071": "Who has consoled me in my sorrow but he?",
  "38072": "Do you forgive me?",
  "38073": "What on airth is agoin to happen now?",
  "38074": "Was she not splendid in the last scene?",
  "38075": "And then, what would the doctor have said?",
  "38076": "And you married her at last, notwithstanding the opposition of her family?",
  "38077": "What made you come here?",
  "38078": "Do you see anything?",
  "38079": "Nothing more than two articles of belief?",
  "38080": "How old be these?",
  "38081": "How did they guess that it is help, just help that one wants?",
  "38082": "Can you?",
  "38083": "Is he changed?",
  "38084": "Well, what do you think?",
  "38085": "Sin?",
  "38086": "What has it go to do with you?",
  "38087": "But who were they whom the sea had drunk?",
  "38088": "What say you, sir?",
  "38089": "Have you changed your mind?",
  "38090": "Now after what manner are they related to ourselves?",
  "38091": "What think you?",
  "38092": "His tale and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be a creature of fine sensations, and did I not as his maker owe him all the portion of happiness that it was in my power to bestow?",
  "38093": "Can I be mistaken?",
  "38094": "HyroQwhich?",
  "38095": "What is it that we really desire?",
  "38096": "You will do me this service, will you not?",

  "39675": "And, more especially, can he pass unfriendly legislation to violate his oath?",
  "39676": "Who's here?",
  "39677": "Now, when he is in this state of mind, if some one gently comes to him and tells him that he is a fool and must get understanding, which can only be got by slaving for it, do you think that, under such adverse circumstances, he will be easily induced to listen?",
  "39678": "What shall be said of these?",
  "39679": "You cannot tell me?",
  "39680": "Where'd you get the blue ticket?",
  "39681": "Surely will my last night's dream be realised?",
  "39682": "Where was he going?",
  "39683": "Stoepel?",
  "39684": "But why should I be there rather than in this beautiful room?",
  "39685": "How well are the machine sheds at the barracks guarded?",
  "39686": "Had you had a row?",
  "39687": "What has it all been about?",
  "39688": "Why did you not darken your light, that he might be stricken with horror at his crime?",
  "39689": "After this?",
  "39690": "Before the boy comes?",
  "39691": "But why need I wear spectacles?",
  "39692": "Where then do you mean to take refuge?",
  "39693": "What are you going to do with him, assuming that you've got him?",
  "39694": "After a pause of several minutes, their silence was broken, by his asking her in a voice of some agitation, when he was to congratulate her on the acquisition of a brother?",
  "39695": "And what did you say to her?",
  "39696": "Why mine?",
  "39697": "Did no one examine?",
  "39698": "Would that be right?",
  "39699": "Had the man committed suicide?",
  "39700": "And how did you verify them?",
  "39701": "Will you be frank, very frank with me?",
  "39702": "Whither should I go?",
  "39703": "Now tell I tell you something?",
  "39704": "Whose voice was that?",
  "39705": "What will happen, then?",
  "39706": "Did he give his name?",
  "39707": "And where is the consulate?",
  "39708": "Why does he let things be so?",
  "39709": "Singly?",
  "39710": "Mary what, then?",
  "39711": "Are you going?",
  "39712": "I suppose you were a gentleman, then, as well as now?",
  "39713": "Will you be pleased to hang me?",
  "39714": "Camp in a bog, would you?",
  "39715": "Ah what's this I smell?",
  "39716": "And why am I disturbed, for the dispersion of my elements will happen whatever I do?",
  "39717": "Do you doubt it?",
  "39718": "But why not, my dear?",
  "39719": "But how did he account for it?",
  "39720": "Danae means a shower of gold, does it not?",
  "39721": "And in that case they will be right in doing good to the evil and evil to the good?",
  "39722": "Would I reflect on the price?",
  "39723": "Does anyone know where it is?",
  "39724": "Perhaps, gentlemen, if he had not said this in your presence and I had reported it, you'd have held this to be impossible likewise, eh?",
  "39725": "As to arming them, how is that to be done?",
  "39726": "How long ago?",
  "39727": "What pickpockets are they who ply their trade in the rear of glory?",
  "39728": "Will not the three men be found?",
  "39729": "What are they doin' THERE, for gracious sakes?",
  "39730": "How is it that that name rises upon all occasions to torment my ears, during the last two or three days?",
  "39731": "Or maybe it is that monsieur does not care to hunt marauders?",
  "39732": "To keep her in?",
  "39733": "And what do you?",
  "39734": "First, you are sorry for what you've done, and you see the folly of it all?",
  "39735": "Are they or their descendants to embrace our faith?",
  "39736": "Where is the church?",
  "39737": "Nor by reason of a knowledge which advises about brazen pots, I said, nor as possessing any other similar knowledge?",
  "39738": "Who shall judge of the continuance of the danger?",
  "39739": "Are you sure we are alone?",
  "39740": "Are you quite sure that this is a man, or that he has ever been one?",
  "39741": "Who said it?",
  "39742": "The queen wears the rosette?",
  "39743": "To give him an opportunity or making some of his severe remarks and moral reflections, and to undo what we had so much trouble in effecting?",
  "39744": "Pannus, pro quo supponit?",
  "39745": "Swann?",
  "39746": "But is there any doubt as to what he will do on the prominent questions if elected?",
  "39747": "Do you count that as nothing?",
  "39748": "Was it religion that prompted him to cannibalism?",
  "39749": "But do you say he will marry you?",
  "39750": "Their feet?",
  "39751": "Wha will bind up the brags of weir?",
  "39752": "Is he still here?",
  "39753": "The thing was proven upon him?",
  "39754": "Do you feel rather easier?",
  "39755": "Where are the matches?",
  "39756": "Then, for all your valour, you would save your life?",
  "39757": "Guilty of what?",
  "39758": "Why, is any day old and new?",
  "39759": "Nor would you say that medicine is the art of receiving pay because a man takes fees when he is engaged in healing?",
  "39760": "You have, at least, money to receive, as you have an order?",
  "39761": "How she does?",
  "39762": "What does he feel?",
  "39763": "Why are they turned out?",
  "39764": "Very decided character there, sir?",
  "39765": "Remain here?",
  "39766": "Where is he?",
  "39767": "How long have you been here?",
  "39768": "Can he hear my word?",
  "39769": "Where is it then?",
  "39770": "Which would you like best for me to make you, a little cake and bless you, or a big cake and curse you?",
  "39771": "His flatterers?",
  "39772": "Reward?",
  "39773": "How shall I bear it?",
  "39774": "Shall we go up and join my mother?",
  "39775": "What made you suppose we should be?",
  "39776": "In gold, silver, or notes?",
  "39777": "But the sympathies of the latter were with the mother?",
  "39778": "What money have we?",
  "39779": "The election came, and what was the result?",
  "39780": "There is no exit?",
  "39781": "You know what a file is?",
  "39782": "A very strange one?",
  "39783": "Did you know that I have a son?",
  "39784": "You are the cure, are you not?",
  "39785": "You see this foot?",
  "39786": "A rabbit?",
  "39787": "Direct?",
  "39788": "Where have you been so long?",
  "39789": "But is it possible that we are not all associated?",
  "39790": "Who can it be?",
  "39791": "Can you say the person who fought many a sanguinary battle, who got through many cunning negotiations with enemies and friends, who personally experienced the troubles of polygamy, was a person sinless and divine?",
  "39792": "Quite well?",
  "39793": "Which makes in my coffers?",
  "39794": "My dear boy, I hope you are not worn out?",
  "39795": "You do not think we would harm you?",
  "39796": "Hempseed?",
  "39797": "But you will go to heaven, mamma, and why should I not speak of it?",
  "39798": "How could a little chap like me hurt so many people?",
  "39799": "And who served under an assumed name?",
  "39800": "Have you another as good?",
  "39801": "Are you sleepy, darling?",
  "39802": "How was he dressed?",
  "39803": "Why ask this grace?",
  "39804": "But, my dear child, do you mean to say you could not love me if I had some other name?",
  "39805": "I will do well?",
  "39806": "Are you not going to wait until we bring the hostages?",
  "39807": "Sit down in your presence?",
  "39808": "I trouble YOU?",
  "39809": "You dismiss me, monsieur?",
  "39810": "Your father's not at home, I think, is he?",
  "39811": "And do you want to know where I found it?",
  "39812": "Do you mean the sorrel horse?",
  "39813": "Do you like me at all?",
  "39814": "Why these cries?",
  "39815": "Are you in a hurry, sir?",
  "39816": "What, now, pray?",
  "39817": "How is it possible for me to lose it at the moment your majesty's service calls for it?",
  "39818": "She was taken ill, you mean, and went home?",
  "39819": "Must one clatter like kettledrums and penitential preachers?",
  "39820": "I understand that the yew hedge is penetrated at one point by a gate?",
  "39821": "For what are words but words?",
  "39822": "How many of the wise and learned have married their cooks?",
  "39823": "Will she be able to go home today?",
  "39824": "But, my friend, is not that just the reason why you should trust in this matter to someone who can be more calm than yourself?",
  "39825": "Himself?",
  "39826": "If the fortifications of it are new or old?",
  "39827": "Do you eat gum leaves?",
  "39828": "Is not this your hope?",
  "39829": "You are not certain, of course?",
  "39830": "What did that poor, sweet girl do that you should want to cast such dishonour on her grave?",
  "39831": "Mine only joy, what can I more?",
  "39832": "Notice a telephone in the outer office?",
  "39833": "And what am I?",
  "39834": "How does that concern you?",
  "39835": "And why were they so terribly afraid of the dark?",
  "39836": "If you are a friend, why do you bite me so hard?",
  "39837": "But what security is there for the same qualities on the part of monarchy?",
  "39838": "And who has been drinking out of my little glass?",
  "39839": "Pip?",
  "39840": "None whatever?",
  "39841": "What is that to the purpose?",
  "39842": "What do you want to satisfy yourself about?",
  "39843": "And do you ask me that?",
  "39844": "Who all our seamen cheated of their debt?",
  "39845": "What's my return?",
  "39846": "How could it be, then, that I did not like her much the better of the two?",
  "39847": "But, gentlemen, whoever can pride himself on his diseases and even swagger over them?",
  "39848": "What force, what invincible instinct, what custom of centuries impels these birds to come back to this place?",
  "39849": "But may I be permitted solemnly to invoke my countrymen to pause and deliberate before they determine to destroy this the grandest temple which has ever been dedicated to human freedom since the world began?",
  "39850": "Well, what's going to happen now?",
  "39851": "What do YOU know about our faces?",
  "39852": "Then, you could dare censure for my sake?",
  "39853": "Had he perhaps chased butterflies too much?",
  "39854": "What, is't a prognostication raps him so?",
  "39855": "The arrangement of papers and documents?",
  "39856": "Well, doctor, suppose we were to go in pursuit of this cloud, since it refuses to burst upon us?",
  "39857": "How CAN I have done that?",
  "39858": "Were you hidden, or not?",
  "39859": "And does not the difference strike you?",
  "39860": "Dangerous?",
  "39861": "How are we this morning?",
  "39862": "And the nurse, of course?",
  "39863": "Is it blank cartridge or ball?",
  "39864": "You got it, then?",
  "39865": "Was there any hope of salvation for her either in this world or the next after such unnatural conduct?",
  "39866": "Pray, would you know the reason why I'm crying?",
  "39867": "Oh, how much for the jacket?",
  "39868": "What's amiss, dame?",
  "39869": "And who has not felt the same?",
  "39870": "What did your people say?",
  "39871": "Who knows not the double motion of the planets?",
  "39872": "Is my understanding sufficient for this or not?",
  "39873": "Was it still at all possible to be alive?",
  "39874": "Why should he be angry?",
  "39875": "Do you think she will find me much changed?",
  "39876": "What's that you've got, a dagger?",
  "39877": "Pray, with all your cleverness, why did not you manage to keep your eyes open?",
  "39878": "Have you got anything?",
  "39879": "You admit that you would fight, then?",
  "39880": "What says he?",
  "39881": "And what, after all, is the matter on hand?",
  "39882": "Or gold, ivory, purple, a lyre, a little knife, a flower, a shrub?",
  "39883": "What you know 'bout witches?",
  "39884": "Has he not come?",
  "39885": "How in the world can I know?",
  "39886": "What engagements?",
  "39887": "And how much do you want?",
  "39888": "What causes historical events?",
  "39889": "Degree of intelligence?",
  "39890": "Do they parade the cemetery as they parade the street?",
  "39891": "The mob's applauses, or the gifts of kings?",
  "39892": "You knew him, did you not?",
  "39893": "Why, how many tall ships, think ye, now, have I seen laid aboard?",
  "39894": "How long have you been here?",
  "39895": "Has it hurt you?",
  "39896": "What harm do they do?",
  "39897": "Friend or enemy?",
  "39898": "And will you really be an advocate for this unthankful, cruel man, who does not love you?",
  "39899": "Where is the count?",
  "39900": "If his mother were there in living burial, what could he do for her?",
  "39901": "But what are they to live upon?",
  "39902": "Grant that he desires the elective franchise, will he not attain it sooner by saving the already advanced steps towards it, than by running backward over them?",
  "39903": "And is he going to take you with him?",
  "39904": "What had he done?",
  "39905": "Well, and how is she?",
  "39906": "Should we let them go on or not?",
  "39907": "Over for the day?",
  "39908": "Is it a faith only for men, then?",
  "39909": "And why are you angry with your brother?",
  "39910": "Why is it art?",
  "39911": "Done?",
  "39912": "By whose permission?",
  "39913": "An cool?",
  "39914": "Can we venture not only to encounter the risk of their individual and mutual mismanagement, but at the same time to place our foreign and domestic policy entirely under the control of a foreign moneyed interest?",
  "39915": "What say ye, children?",
  "39916": "Say, can you make those dollars yet?",
  "39917": "What does that matter?",
  "39918": "Why do you debase yourself before them?",
  "39919": "What must then be done?",
  "39920": "Was I never to know ardent, feverish love in the moonlit shadows of a summer's night?",
  "39921": "Ever arise in society, and what principle there is in human nature so powerful as to overcome so strong a passion, or so violent as to obscure so clear a knowledge?",
  "39922": "Should he say he had been robbed?",
  "39923": "If he sent her the verses?",
  "39924": "How must I take hold of you in order not to hurt you?",
  "39925": "You've heard me grunt lately?",
  "39926": "Are you coming, m'dear?",
  "39927": "Soothly, who can say?",
  "39928": "Is not pleasing this?",
  "39929": "And suppose I brought you some money?",
  "39930": "Do any among them speak our language?",
  "39931": "And you want to talk to me about it instead of listening to me?",
  "39932": "Now, is it not unjust, and unlike you, to judge him from what you saw of me the other night?",
  "39933": "And on what account, my dear lieutenant?",
  "39934": "When have you found me false to your teaching?",
  "39935": "As what?",
  "39936": "Children alive?",
  "39937": "And what became of the parcel then?",
  "39938": "How much wages do you want a month?",
  "39939": "How dare you say this of me?",
  "39940": "Well, have you solved it?",
  "39941": "Is he dead indeed?",
  "39942": "Can it be that it's only possible to be just negatively?",
  "39943": "And who is to be the dean?",
  "39944": "Did you meet with any accident?",
  "39945": "Hansel, why do you stop and look round?",
  "39946": "Tell me what I must say to him?",
  "39947": "But who knows?",
  "39948": "Is it not sufficient for your infernal selfishness, that while you are at peace I shall writhe in the torments of hell?",
  "39949": "Amigoarawaysoo?",
  "39950": "This being so, is it really wise to let him be poor?",
  "39951": "Would it be a sin to rid the world of such a wretch?",
  "39952": "Have we lost our provisions?",
  "39953": "Was the cup left here?",
  "39954": "Run?",
  "39955": "Still, why should you not again be free, since you have already been so?",
  "39956": "Had you any conversation with the prisoner?",
  "39957": "Through what medium?",
  "39958": "Do you remember that?",
  "39959": "And evidently they must have had enough food, but where on earth had they got it from?",
  "39960": "Why who are you to come thus brawling upon my premises?",
  "39961": "Do you suppose your being young and natural, and fond of me and grateful to me, makes it any pleasure to me to have you near me?",
  "39962": "The cow?",
  "39963": "What sort of a man was he?",
  "39964": "How doth this harmonise?",
  "39965": "Will you send her any message?",
  "39966": "Why, what else can she do?",
  "39967": "What would they say to a bishop who was afraid?",
  "39968": "How is anyone to tell a story which he cannot understand himself?",
  "39969": "The question now was, who was the man and who was it brought him the coronet?",
  "39970": "Why should I pay?",
  "39971": "Does he wish to be king?",
  "39972": "Shall you be leaving here soon?",
  "39973": "Is she like you?",
  "39974": "Pretty amiable?",
  "39975": "We have three days left, you say?",
  "39976": "Even in such a case, would not the official oath be broken if the government should be overthrown when it was believed that disregarding the single law would tend to preserve it?",
  "39977": "Would that be decent of you?",
  "39978": "In order that the earth should produce, it is necessary that it should be turned up, is it not so?",
  "39979": "And where is it?",
  "39980": "If I can, why am I disturbed?",
  "39981": "He has?",
  "39982": "How can the spirits of the past always live in a crowd?",
  "39983": "Do you remark how curiously it dances upon the crests of the waves?",
  "39984": "Why was he to be the judge?",
  "39985": "Would she laugh?",
  "39986": "Let us see the map?",
  "39987": "Perfidious to you?",
  "39988": "About what time?",
  "39989": "Was anybody ever so much in love with you?",
  "39990": "What did he say?",
  "39991": "Does the lapse of time reveal defects?",
  "39992": "Does he indeed?",
  "39993": "When your husband that'll be so soon, is here fur to take you home?",
  "39994": "Was the window open?",
  "39995": "And should we not enquire what sort of knowledge has the power of effecting such a change?",
  "39996": "What follows?",
  "39997": "I lodge complaints?",
  "39998": "Or to what purpose would it be established, in reference to one branch of the legislature, if it could not be extended to the other?",
  "39999": "Well, what did I tell you of him?",
  "40000": "Adopted him?",
  "40001": "And why?",
  "40002": "That I should work and not eat anything?",
  "40003": "What did it all matter?",
  "40004": "Bonaparte at first paid great attention to the women, particularly those who possessed personal attractions, and asked them, in his rapid way, whether they were married?",
  "40005": "How many people do you wish to bring with you?",
  "40006": "Still looking for your boot?",
  "40007": "What's that you are saying?",
  "40008": "How can I tell?",
  "40009": "So that I have not offended any of you?",
  "40010": "Are they all full?",
  "40011": "A splendid group of men, are they not?",
  "40012": "Who do you mean?",
  "40013": "In the night?",
  "40014": "And would it not be wise to place a power of remission somewhere, so that these persons may know they have something to lose by persisting and something to gain by desisting?",
  "40015": "That that young man is an assassin?",
  "40016": "Now then?",
  "40017": "Nothing, madame?",
  "40018": "Do you suppose that secrets can be kept when so many people know them?",
  "40019": "Know him?",
  "40020": "Well the strangers stood their ground, but what booted their doughty prowess?",
  "40021": "Do you recollect the necklace?",
  "40022": "What was this vessel?",
  "40023": "But, set that consideration aside, what is the obligation you have to me?",
  "40024": "Then you know him?",
  "40025": "You spoke to him in that manner?",
  "40026": "Are we to hope or fear?",
  "40027": "Where was his daring stride now?",
  "40028": "And what did she say then?",
  "40029": "If I give you the money for this purpose, will you keep my secret as you have kept your own?",
  "40030": "Who's made appointments with him in the hold?",
  "40031": "Will you ever be impudent to me again?",
  "40032": "But how can I settle to work by myself?",
  "40033": "What is it, cousin, what ails you?",
  "40034": "Will you do it?",
  "40035": "Would you like to tell me something, oh honourable one?",
  "40036": "I have certainly got thistles for figs in a worldly sense, but how could I tell what time would bring forth?",
  "40037": "You are in pain?",
  "40038": "Tell me, how was she when you left her?",
  "40039": "Sonya, are you asleep?",
  "40040": "Did anything unusual happen to mark that particular day?",
  "40041": "What med be the right way?",
  "40042": "But of what society?",
  "40043": "But this isthmus is composed of nothing but quick sands?",
  "40044": "Now, how many degrees can you count between the two points?",
  "40045": "Why flock you thus to me in multitudes?",
  "40046": "Can I do otherwise for a father who has done so much for me?",
  "40047": "What are you all laughing at now, pray?",
  "40048": "You are, are you?",
  "40049": "Where is father now?",
  "40050": "What are the counterweights which overpower these merits?",
  "40051": "What are these songs, and what do they mean?",
  "40052": "But what do you hope from keeping him in his mistake?",
  "40053": "Are you ladies changing your quarters?",
  "40054": "Shall I covet my neighbour's maidservant?",

  "40061": "What do you say, little woman?",
  "40062": "You can be when you choose?",
  "40063": "Are you quite sure that's the sum, father?",
  "40064": "Is it not powerfully reasoned?",

  "40474": "And when will that be?",
  "40475": "Off where?",
  "40476": "A quarrel already?",
  "40477": "Was that not desire?",
  "40478": "Why not have kept him here among the rest, and made a sneaking, snivelling pickpocket of him at once?",

  "40480": "Arrow?",
  "40481": "Everything going all right?",
  "40482": "Yes, here it lies before me, but why is the deputation from the city so long in appearing?",
  "40483": "But the lady?",
  "40484": "More what, guardian?",
  "40485": "We had to consider, first, whether our proposals were possible, and secondly whether they were the most beneficial?",
  "40486": "What think you of that?",
  "40487": "Whither are you bound?",
  "40488": "Where so much of industry, with so little noise and bustle?",
  "40489": "I wonder what becomes of that kind when it goes up country?",

  "40584": "Home here?",
  "40585": "I wonder if they noticed you?",
  "40586": "Was he, in the midst of these distractions, these affections which absorbed his life, suddenly smitten with one of those mysterious and terrible blows which sometimes overwhelm, by striking to his heart, a man whom public catastrophes would not shake, by striking at his existence and his fortune?",
  "40587": "Is this unity?",
  "40588": "Do you wish to play the braggart with an unarmed man?",

  "40615": "You admit attacking the plaintiff?",
  "40616": "Who would employ a boy of my age on a farm or in a factory?",
  "40617": "And what sort of a picture would that make?",
  "40618": "What is the matter with you, my dear?",
  "40619": "But why should I be amused?",
  "40620": "What are these warnings?",
  "40621": "Is it so terrible to be old?",
  "40622": "Will you tell me where you are going, you wretch?",
  "40623": "Did I make a contract with him in the forest, and sign it with my blood?",
  "40624": "Ah, she likes to be liked?",
  "40625": "What makes you talk like that?",
  "40626": "Where can I go?",
  "40627": "Where is MY home?",
  "40628": "Did you hear that?",
  "40629": "Whom shall I announce?",
  "40630": "Said I not rightly that we are a wonderful people?",
  "40631": "To whom is she to be married?",
  "40632": "And are suits decided on any other ground but that a man may neither take what is another's, nor be deprived of what is his own?",
  "40633": "How did you bear your disappointment?",
  "40634": "And you have learned nothing from any other quarter?",
  "40635": "But in what consists this preference?",
  "40636": "And the prince was pleased with you?",
  "40637": "How do we learn anything at all?",
  "40638": "But what about this interminable war?",
  "40639": "And the spider?",
  "40640": "What were they?",
  "40641": "Now what do you think of that?",
  "40642": "Can he bring a suit against him to recover his business and property?",
  "40643": "In such a matter as what?",
  "40644": "Where was she?",
  "40645": "Am I rude?",
  "40646": "Will you admit so much?",
  "40647": "Well, are you having a pleasant journey?",
  "40648": "Have you no present interest in any of the company who occupy the sofas and chairs before you?",
  "40649": "What is the lowest you will take for him?",
  "40650": "And why expose his own children in the battle?",
  "40651": "Look here, young man, are you sure you've no idea where your sister is?",
  "40652": "Are there lights in the windows?",
  "40653": "So you've been here a whole hour?",
  "40654": "Now, follow that passage with your eye, and tell me whether it distinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that he was instructed by his legal advisers wholly to reserve his defence?",
  "40655": "How could I live an alien in that house where I had been the child?",
  "40656": "Shall you stay there?",
  "40657": "Who has not heard of the hardest drinker in all the army?",
  "40658": "Would it be kindness?",
  "40659": "And how shall we manage the period between birth and education, which seems to require the greatest care?",
  "40660": "How do you know she has?",
  "40661": "It was running wild after the girls may be?",
  "40662": "He sent some one?",
  "40663": "Who would know so well as you how to teach the lesson of endurance to others?",
  "40664": "Did I not think so?",
  "40665": "By making them stronger for each other's aid, will you make her less willing to discharge a lighter than a greater responsibility?",
  "40666": "But when your father comes back tomorrow what am I to tell him?",
  "40667": "Oh, do you then know him?",
  "40668": "And you think it quite right?",
  "40669": "Then, again, within the city, how will they exchange their productions?",
  "40670": "Believe what?",
  "40671": "Now, my boy, which house is it?",
  "40672": "Perhaps, concerned only for his imminent doom, he had not had sincere sorrow for his sin?",
  "40673": "How can we help?",
  "40674": "How could a man like him be expected to have any pleasure in such a discovery?",
  "40675": "So it was YOUR cry of distress that I heard?",
  "40676": "But do you suppose that if I had been I should have asked you to let me go and live with him?",
  "40677": "Are you coming?",
  "40678": "Is it strife?",
  "40679": "What needs he the defence this arm can make?",
  "40680": "Do I understand it?",
  "40681": "What about the general?",
  "40682": "Your brother was, I believe, unmarried, was he not?",
  "40683": "What will the archbishop think of that?",
  "40684": "Less pedigree?",
  "40685": "What was then to be done?",
  "40686": "Why did not you all learn?",
  "40687": "Does it apply well to my suit?",
  "40688": "You mean my mother?",
  "40689": "What does he think I can do with his five francs?",
  "40690": "What lunacy are you talking?",
  "40691": "How could he hope ever to grow up to be as good and wise as they, or even tolerably good and wise?",
  "40692": "Lie down?",
  "40693": "Why not, my love?",
  "40694": "More smart, is it?",
  "40695": "Can it be with me?",
  "40696": "Lord?",
  "40697": "What is the matter with you that you know them?",
  "40698": "What does he mean by using a shotgun when silence was his one chance of escape?",
  "40699": "Is the time ripe now?",
  "40700": "What will be our future condition if he should beget other suns?",
  "40701": "But why are we standing here?",
  "40702": "But who knows, madam, but somebody that shall be nameless would like me best with all my little finery about me?",
  "40703": "Why had he wasted his time hunting?",
  "40704": "In the hat?",
  "40705": "What is there in your mind?",
  "40706": "You really love, then, no lady at this court?",
  "40707": "Will she be safe over there?",
  "40708": "Have you a mind to teach the beavers to sing?",
  "40709": "Why was this?",
  "40710": "What have you got to say next?",
  "40711": "How soon can he be here?",
  "40712": "Now, what DO you want to buy?",
  "40713": "How you come to fall out?",
  "40714": "Will he come again?",
  "40715": "Where have you put it?",
  "40716": "Can you provide that they shall be separated at bed and board?",
  "40717": "Did anything happen this time?",
  "40718": "Where does my father get all that iron rust from?",
  "40719": "And you choose that time for grazing?",
  "40720": "Fifteen shillings a week not much, young man?",
  "40721": "If I could do that, simpleton, where would the danger be?",
  "40722": "A natural death is better than an artificial life, surely?",
  "40723": "Children dear, were we long alone?",
  "40724": "Is this number seven?",
  "40725": "Why do you suppose that I should look severely on your affection for that young man?",
  "40726": "Is this a weather to send benevolence?",
  "40727": "Who was the criminal, then?",
  "40728": "And what reason is that?",
  "40729": "Where was the difficulty?",
  "40730": "What do I care about blood?",
  "40731": "What is that stupid fellow troubling himself about?",
  "40732": "Is this a preparation for immortality?",
  "40733": "Had I ever seen so much loathing and pale horror on one countenance?",
  "40734": "When shall we start?",
  "40735": "Did I, sir?",
  "40736": "And who can tell when these happy hours may return?",
  "40737": "We were saying that the parents should be in the prime of life?",
  "40738": "Are these no capital?",
  "40739": "A little of the wine?",
  "40740": "Why did I at once experience a shock?",
  "40741": "Cannot I cut off the part and restore you by a sweat bath?",
  "40742": "Should art be taken seriously?",
  "40743": "But how are you to get that balance?",
  "40744": "Why this hostility of interests?",
  "40745": "What availed the noise and bustle of cheerful morning, which penetrated even there, to him?",
  "40746": "Have we not tramps and beggars enough already to pester us as we sit at meat?",
  "40747": "When shall it be?",
  "40748": "Can you turn a strain to the ladies, sir?",
  "40749": "Over whom?",
  "40750": "Would not jets of boiling water, constantly injected by the pumps, raise the temperature in this part and stay the congelation?",
  "40751": "What difference would that make?",
  "40752": "Or look you I should play the orator?",
  "40753": "Doth not wealth satiate, and become nauseous, and no longer serve to satisfy or pleasure, or to buy an hour's peace of mind?",
  "40754": "And did you do anything?",
  "40755": "You were going to say, thirdly?",
  "40756": "Do they really, you dog?",
  "40757": "Into a new light?",
  "40758": "Did she want to stay at home?",
  "40759": "Which building?",
  "40760": "But why should I consort, I, a brave man, with the abominable?",
  "40761": "Can you guess, now, what this is?",
  "40762": "Suppose you were a foundling and were shown our faith and yours, and asked for which you would decide, which would you choose?",
  "40763": "And how on earth would she ever manage to hold her tongue during school hours?",
  "40764": "Are we afraid of foreign gold?",
  "40765": "Was it a double tooth, hey?",
  "40766": "And how can it all be done by daybreak?",
  "40767": "After these, what resentment can remain in the heart?",
  "40768": "But if she has so absolutely failed, what then had she done?",
  "40769": "And you remember, too, the period when he began to grow fatter?",
  "40770": "What is nature?",
  "40771": "What was it that was borne in upon my mind when she stood still and looked attentively at me?",
  "40772": "And you're not frightened?",
  "40773": "Are you a politician, friend?",
  "40774": "Have you not got all the plants and stones you want?",
  "40775": "What time was it?",
  "40776": "Is it obeying your husband to disobey him on the wital subject of his business?",
  "40777": "On what grounds?",
  "40778": "What is your address in the country?",
  "40779": "How will he ever know the truth, since I shall not tell him of it?",
  "40780": "It was he who rescued you?",
  "40781": "What, for instance, do you mean by all that humbug about the soul?",
  "40782": "Cannot I answer your purpose?",
  "40783": "To whom did he give up his sword?",
  "40784": "Would not that be a sacrifice of higher prospects for you?",
  "40785": "Say, what can cause such impotence of mind?",
  "40786": "But the doctor?",
  "40787": "What business have I with this pipe?",
  "40788": "You have a recipe for it?",
  "40789": "But she?",
  "40790": "Do you know anything about fortifications?",
  "40791": "Is there no merit in repentance?",
  "40792": "What became of you, dear?",
  "40793": "Well, what is to be done, mademoiselle, when so many wills are leagued against me?",
  "40794": "And besides, what is truth to us but the continuous progress of our mind from poetry to prose?",
  "40795": "Is there any point to which you would wish to draw my attention?",
  "40796": "Shall we go in?",
  "40797": "And how would I do it, think you?",
  "40798": "At least we can have a window?",
  "40799": "It was somewhere here?",
  "40800": "Must one die like a dog?",
  "40801": "What does that wagon contain?",
  "40802": "What's the matter with your leg?",
  "40803": "Might not some curious eye fasten on it, and divine its contents?",
  "40804": "What is the difference?",
  "40805": "Who's the other fool?",
  "40806": "Well, do you understand, monsieur?",
  "40807": "You are doing catkins?",
  "40808": "Now, how does a man search a revolving bookcase?",
  "40809": "On what ground do you venture to interfere with me, messieurs?",
  "40810": "What ails ye, man?",
  "40811": "What would be your surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness?",
  "40812": "If you're not coming yourself, give us the cards, will you?",
  "40813": "In the office?",
  "40814": "Ah, precious one, why does your lover live to see you dead?",
  "40815": "Could she be deceived as to the meaning of this?",
  "40816": "Do you really mean to say that that leg of yours is better already?",
  "40817": "Do you not think perhaps that some of the shortcoming lies with yourself?",
  "40818": "Her name?",
  "40819": "How can that be, monsieur?",
  "40820": "What duties?",
  "40821": "And suppose he can obtain his desires, is that so bad as cutting her throat?",
  "40822": "Look here, do you intend to take up you abode with us?",
  "40823": "What do you want to drink now?",
  "40824": "Carey?",
  "40825": "Happy?",

  "40837": "With what color of propriety could the force necessary for defense be limited by those who cannot limit the force of offense?",
  "40838": "Is it bright?",
  "40839": "How could I know he hated him?",
  "40840": "And all this, for what, I pray?",
  "40841": "Who told you that I loved him?",
  "40842": "Is that what you meant?",
  "40843": "And did I do it for my country's sake?",
  "40844": "Why did you get married?",
  "40845": "But what exactly am I to tell you about them?",
  "40846": "Now where will it be agreeable to you that we hold our conference?",
  "40847": "Why does fate play such tricks with poor, helpless worms?",
  "40848": "Have you ever seen a snake rise up on your path?",

  "41314": "As he had a battle to fight, might it not be best to put a bold face upon it?",
  "41315": "And what was the result of those duels?",
  "41316": "Well, who DOES tell you she has?",
  "41317": "Do you mean to say the climate has really any such influence?",
  "41318": "Can you tell?",

  "41324": "Is there not time enough for that?",
  "41325": "You'll have some meat?",
  "41326": "Well, what's the matter?",
  "41327": "Why should they ask us?",
  "41328": "Is it not a greater wonder that they should be kept up anywhere?",
  "41329": "Why did the old folly end now, and no later?",

  "41341": "Hallo PUSSUM, when did you come back?",
  "41342": "Why this precautionary view, she asked herself afresh, when her father had complained, at the very least, as little as herself?",
  "41343": "Why, what ails you?",
  "41344": "Do you care for me?",
  "41345": "Where to get the money?",

  "41634": "Where did you go?",
  "41635": "Ah, how would she feel then?",
  "41636": "Did he wear a vest?",
  "41637": "Now, do you honestly think they can?",
  "41638": "What is its breadth?",
  "41639": "It's a bad business, eh?",
  "41640": "Do you waltz?",
  "41641": "Have you no place you call a parlour?",
  "41642": "You never intended really to propose to go with me to the altar, and then make yourself rich by one great perjury?",
  "41643": "How could I?",
  "41644": "Are you content with yourself and with your life?",
  "41645": "And what does the author mean to do?",
  "41646": "Was it intentionally?",
  "41647": "May I ask your reason for such an insulting supposition, sir?",
  "41648": "What was the force of that army?",
  "41649": "But of what?",
  "41650": "Do you know where we are going?",
  "41651": "What's the use of it?",
  "41652": "What year?",
  "41653": "But, woe is me, wherefore do I complain?",
  "41654": "Have you a garden of your own?",
  "41655": "Why is not this principle universal?",
  "41656": "And was the sum a large one?",
  "41657": "Why, we are all mortal, are we not?",
  "41658": "Philip, how can you be so unkind?",
  "41659": "Where is he now?",
  "41660": "Will your majesty please proceed?",
  "41661": "And, besides, what is paying it but submission to tyranny?",
  "41662": "But why all this secrecy?",
  "41663": "Oh, gosh?",
  "41664": "Not much in the habit of such travelling yourself, I think, sir?",
  "41665": "But what's the matter with you?",
  "41666": "Besides, what could you have to tell me?",
  "41667": "You know that you are recalled to life?",
  "41668": "Will she be back soon?",
  "41669": "Airing yourself, as I am doing, before you go to bed?",
  "41670": "And the sometime greater to the sometime less, and the greater that is to be to the less that is to be?",
  "41671": "Do you like that dining at the tables d'hote?",
  "41672": "Is the hand not always pointing there?",
  "41673": "But who was the spy who stole the papers?",
  "41674": "So it's 'Eat my dear birdies,' is it, young man?",
  "41675": "And yet the cardinal was attached to you?",
  "41676": "Can any woman alive believe you in earnest, or think you design anything but to banter her?",
  "41677": "But, such being the case, where could you have heard the same report?",
  "41678": "Why had he not told her everything?",
  "41679": "Who is that BRAHMA?",
  "41680": "What offence did I commit?",
  "41681": "Where am I to find them?",
  "41682": "What paper have you written for?",
  "41683": "How should the leman of a vassal become a king's wife?",
  "41684": "Where are you from?",
  "41685": "Is it he?",
  "41686": "And these other instruments, the use of which I cannot guess?",
  "41687": "She will pay, only when?",
  "41688": "Do you mean write it to her?",
  "41689": "How do you make that out?",
  "41690": "Russian books, indeed ?",
  "41691": "Will you walk in, sir?",
  "41692": "To whom then?",
  "41693": "You prefer to stay here and imagine that all the world is gaping at your pictures?",
  "41694": "What know I of the minister's heart?",
  "41695": "And why among us four?",
  "41696": "You were looking for me out of the window?",
  "41697": "Has he not already forgotten she ever existed?",
  "41698": "Is he not solid gold?",
  "41699": "What are their secret counsels?",
  "41700": "Who'll say a guinea?",
  "41701": "Do you think I particularly like you?",
  "41702": "Who is he, my dear?",
  "41703": "And did you?",
  "41704": "Shall I ever know any thing?",
  "41705": "Where is that murderer?",
  "41706": "Oh, is it broken?",
  "41707": "And is there no room for love there?",
  "41708": "For not alluding to your leaving us?",
  "41709": "What then must be the result?",
  "41710": "What is all settled?",
  "41711": "Saw you those meteors?",
  "41712": "And what will that good treatment be?",
  "41713": "Well, but is there any war on record which was carried on successfully by him, or aided by his counsels, when he was alive?",
  "41714": "Do you want a map?",
  "41715": "But what other is there?",
  "41716": "You understand the rest, then?",
  "41717": "Where were we?",
  "41718": "Would you have 'em both before marriage?",
  "41719": "Why was it?",
  "41720": "What made you choose that particular direction?",
  "41721": "Then the cost of this vessel is great?",
  "41722": "Socrates, has taken possession of you all?",
  "41723": "Have you seen for YOUR self?",
  "41724": "Bore me, my dear?",
  "41725": "How can I ever pay you?",
  "41726": "Give me one little sip more, and tell me from whom you received the noble gift?",
  "41727": "But the orders?",
  "41728": "How here?",
  "41729": "Did he not, my dear father and mother, deserve all the truth to be told?",
  "41730": "You think that likely?",
  "41731": "Can we not better make the attempt after dark?",
  "41732": "Carver, you DO think him witty?",
  "41733": "Giry?",
  "41734": "Why are they leaving the town?",
  "41735": "What is the meaning of that noise?",
  "41736": "And did you go alone?",
  "41737": "What good wind brings you here?",
  "41738": "And if he were dead, to what height of fury would not the violence of the people lash the legionaries?",
  "41739": "You see I am generous, am I not, mother?",
  "41740": "What charm has gone from the twilight?",
  "41741": "What is it, sir?",
  "41742": "And what brought you here?",
  "41743": "Could he have any, do you suppose?",
  "41744": "FOOD FOR THE VULTURES?",
  "41745": "Is it as nice as it sounds?",
  "41746": "You're no wiser than the rest of us, are you?",
  "41747": "Still dreaming and staring?",
  "41748": "How dare you say such things about me?",
  "41749": "Is it not true that legists are governed by caprice in giving and taking away rights?",
  "41750": "Will you go over and get some canned peaches?",
  "41751": "Do not you think that if I were about any king, proposing good laws to him, and endeavouring to root out all the cursed seeds of evil that I found in him, I should either be turned out of his court, or, at least, be laughed at for my pains?",
  "41752": "And you heard nothing, and saw nothing?",
  "41753": "When did he go to church last?",
  "41754": "Which then shall we prefer?",
  "41755": "What more inconstant than the desires of man?",
  "41756": "And you obeyed?",
  "41757": "Which should he take?",
  "41758": "What's the matter?",
  "41759": "Does it not make you shudder?",
  "41760": "What infernal noise?",
  "41761": "Jellyby's?",
  "41762": "Do any of you know of one?",
  "41763": "They did not, and why not?",
  "41764": "When do you leave town?",
  "41765": "He knows what YOU know?",
  "41766": "What are you bothering him for?",
  "41767": "What can it be?",
  "41768": "How, sir?",
  "41769": "Whom shall we call, lest spectres should appear?",
  "41770": "Differently?",
  "41771": "And how am I to cross?",
  "41772": "But what am I going to eat?",
  "41773": "How often am I to call you?",
  "41774": "Is it not a source of mortification to a class of men that they are excluded from political power?",
  "41775": "Do you see this parcel?",
  "41776": "A murder do you call it?",
  "41777": "Who does not love you?",
  "41778": "And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?",
  "41779": "How like you her wit?",
  "41780": "Have you got anything of your own?",
  "41781": "But where are the folk?",
  "41782": "But shall I not use tobacco at all?",
  "41783": "Will you never be done getting me into trouble?",
  "41784": "Françoise, all these young fellows not caring two straws for their lives?",
  "41785": "Why, tell me, said he, what answer you would make?",
  "41786": "What can be done with four?",
  "41787": "Was he not contented with his children?",
  "41788": "Can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws?",
  "41789": "You have nothing more to say?",
  "41790": "And, as he so resolved, he could not but ask himself the question, whether the charge of the parish ought to be left in the hands of such a man?",
  "41791": "You told him that?",
  "41792": "Would you advise me, whilst able to fight, to throw the arms I hold in my hand to the ground?",
  "41793": "Now, what do you want with me?",
  "41794": "What are people planning against him?",
  "41795": "Forever a footman?",
  "41796": "But where are we, uncle?",
  "41797": "Who forced my hand, as was the lawful cap'n?",
  "41798": "Will your majesty do me the honor to explain yourself?",
  "41799": "Who could this young woman be, I wonder?",
  "41800": "The beginning of what?",
  "41801": "Who d'you work for?",
  "41802": "Why does the theatre draw me so that I am willing to sacrifice for it even those I love?",
  "41803": "Can you remember?",
  "41804": "What should ail them?",
  "41805": "But why should these rough drafts of letters be regarded as anything else than what they actually and obviously are?",
  "41806": "Why had he married the eyes in the photograph?",
  "41807": "Ned, my dear fellow, will you mention what we agreed upon?",
  "41808": "Do you know what that is?",
  "41809": "Was he satisfied?",
  "41810": "Have you been for a soldier?",
  "41811": "Where are the brothers?",
  "41812": "He whom your aunt intends for you?",
  "41813": "I was to leave town the next day for a fortnight's absence, and whom had they to see to them?",
  "41814": "What do I ask now?",
  "41815": "What shall we do for dessert?",
  "41816": "Who do you give your casting vote to?",
  "41817": "How is it that this difference happens?",
  "41818": "But do you only labour at the graves of children, and young people?",
  "41819": "What became of the two men?",
  "41820": "And has not the body itself less of truth and essence than the soul?",
  "41821": "Better?",
  "41822": "You came straight here?",
  "41823": "She did, hey?",
  "41824": "All of us?",
  "41825": "Shall we turn back, or run into a cottage?",
  "41826": "Why did his condition improve?",
  "41827": "How was it?",
  "41828": "Will they permit me to enter?",
  "41829": "And if it is not sorcery, what is it, then?",
  "41830": "Was she lying?",
  "41831": "Why do you kneel to me?",
  "41832": "Jane, are you ready?",
  "41833": "Then you suppose it was the people alone who wished to burn the condemned?",
  "41834": "Is it a strict moral obligation?",
  "41835": "Who came hither?",
  "41836": "How will you judge the counterfeit, if you have no guarantee?",
  "41837": "Damn it now, what's his name?",
  "41838": "And stealing yet more blessed than taking?",
  "41839": "Is there ony room at your feet?",
  "41840": "May I count on you?",
  "41841": "And where am I to sit?",
  "41842": "Where has she taken refuge?",
  "41843": "Why should I go to see them, therefore?",
  "41844": "And if he found them differing as much from one another as from his first counsellors, would he not act prudently in trying the experiment unanimously recommended by the latter, rather than be hearkening to those who could neither deny the necessity of a speedy remedy, nor agree in proposing one?",
  "41845": "Are there not the unjust who are fortunate, while the just are unfortunate?",
  "41846": "What would he think of me, of my lack of will?",
  "41847": "Is the imp altogether evil?",
  "41848": "In this new revolution thus established forever, who shall decide which is the sun and which is the moon?",
  "41849": "Of THEMSELVES?",
  "41850": "What are you saying to me?",
  "41851": "What is yonder?",
  "41852": "When did you lie, the last time or now?",
  "41853": "Did he live his life again in every detail of desire, temptation, and surrender during that supreme moment of complete knowledge?",
  "41854": "Did you see him?",
  "41855": "What prompted me then to disturb the memory of the buried dead?",
  "41856": "How shall we destroy him?",
  "41857": "Am I not your mother also?",
  "41858": "And the bridegroom?",
  "41859": "What are young men to rocks and mountains?",
  "41860": "I am her father, am I not?",
  "41861": "Going to be in town long?",
  "41862": "But when will that be?",
  "41863": "But what have I done to you?",
  "41864": "Yours is a long life to look back upon, sir?",
  "41865": "Then it was you?",
  "41866": "Why have you come?",
  "41867": "And that we may dismiss you to the moor and the rainy night?",
  "41868": "Will it come off?",
  "41869": "Why is there so much negation and abnegation in your hearts?",
  "41870": "And is there any greater or keener pleasure than that of sensual love?",
  "41871": "You know the consequences of mixing them?",
  "41872": "When have I been hash, tell me?",
  "41873": "Did you think a gentleman would be likely to take any interest in you?",
  "41874": "But what reference has that to me?",
  "41875": "You were her first love?",
  "41876": "Who were they?",
  "41877": "Yet why a second venture try?",
  "41878": "Do you want him to be fond of you?",
  "41879": "Where would you go?",
  "41880": "What advantages had she?",
  "41881": "Well, how has all gone off?",
  "41882": "Do we pay no money?",
  "41883": "What weapon would he choose?",
  "41884": "Why did he not go on?",
  "41885": "What will you take for it?",
  "41886": "Anything for me?",
  "41887": "What is there more?",
  "41888": "Is your majesty satisfied to see the earl and the queen make their appearance at this meeting?",
  "41889": "What possessed you to tell those stories about my saddle, and the hats and boots, and all the rest of it?",
  "41890": "Perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him?",
  "41891": "Was I, then, not yet aware that what I felt, myself, for her, depended neither upon her actions nor upon my desires?",
  "41892": "Even as a man who rides a horse is called a horseman?",
  "41893": "Not to me, I hope?",
  "41894": "Has he any objection to make to them which would justify him in overturning them?",
  "41895": "A young gentleman, is he not?",
  "41896": "But have you reflected seriously?",
  "41897": "Is this your indifference, your uninteresting conversation?",
  "41898": "Then one may smoke on board?",
  "41899": "Why should not she be a maid of honor, as well as myself?",
  "41900": "What will come out of those three elements when I am no longer present to combine them?",
  "41901": "Stopping here?",
  "41902": "Sed?",
  "41903": "It appears then that the world judge correctly, why should you be ashamed of their favorable judgment?",
  "41904": "As princes of the blood, in fact?",
  "41905": "What, faithless?",
  "41906": "What else do you want?",
  "41907": "May I help you off with your helmet?",
  "41908": "Why has she been crying?",
  "41909": "What can they have done with him?",
  "41910": "Do you love me, then?",
  "41911": "Will they neither obey nor make room for those who will?",
  "41912": "At what point shall we expect the approach of danger?",
  "41913": "But shall not we, ourselves, the truth maintain?",
  "41914": "My dear, do you see?",
  "41915": "But, after all, what is this metaphor called a crown, or rather what is monarchy?",
  "41916": "Is the aggregate power of the general government greater than ought to have been vested in it?",
  "41917": "Do you doubt them?",
  "41918": "Would you take a creature that has not a groat in the world?",
  "41919": "And that other gentleman?",
  "41920": "What would your excellency like to eat?",
  "41921": "How much do a king git?",
  "41922": "How many times?",
  "41923": "Why should she not be his?",
  "41924": "How do you maintain discipline among your men?",
  "41925": "And are you going to have no breakfast or dinner today?",
  "41926": "What make do you like?",
  "41927": "Where are you going, old fellow?",
  "41928": "What is the bridge for?",
  "41929": "You think I was concerned in the plot which brought about the rupture, do you not?",
  "41930": "Who was by him at night?",
  "41931": "Fit, I hope?",
  "41932": "Less than two minutes?",
  "41933": "Nor lay before your eyes what afflictions you yourselves have undergone?",
  "41934": "Mind?",
  "41935": "Suppose, then, a man speak an idle word, and die suddenly, before he has time to repent and confess his sin, will he be lost everlastingly?",
  "41936": "You were also married before you had this wife?",
  "41937": "Was the cause of death mentioned?",
  "41938": "The little princess?",
  "41939": "And that door is locked?",
  "41940": "Yes, or no?",
  "41941": "Found what?",
  "41942": "Why do you give the poor fellow no hope?",
  "41943": "Ah, what have you done to me?",
  "41944": "But what in the name of goodness could provoke you to tempt your fate so long?",
  "41945": "What can more exactly answer the rule laid down, to recommend even those representations of things which have so many other just objections leaving against them?",
  "41946": "Has such and such a perfume done anything for me?",
  "41947": "You want big things that you can make your teeth meet in?",
  "41948": "Why did you tell me those things?",
  "41949": "I am not exempt, and ask now, shall I tend the herds?",
  "41950": "Can it be used against me?",
  "41951": "Where have you hurt yourself?",
  "41952": "Could you believe in the existence of such a colossal dunce?",
  "41953": "Did such a being exist?",
  "41954": "Wherein do the principles of scientific management differ essentially from those of ordinary management?",
  "41955": "How's his heart?",
  "41956": "But what's in this chest?",
  "41957": "Quite a big girl, I expect?",
  "41958": "You think not?",
  "41959": "Did I shoot straight, nurse?",
  "41960": "Agnes, shall I tell you what about?",
  "41961": "Explained nothing?",
  "41962": "And my position with regard to money?",
  "41963": "What's got into the beast?",
  "41964": "What colour?",
  "41965": "What's the meaning of this, madame?",
  "41966": "Have you a heart?",
  "41967": "You find it so?",
  "41968": "I mean, what makes them so shiny?",
  "41969": "Why, in a word, by thus speaking, do you prevent me from being frank in my turn?",
  "41970": "Can you prove that they aim at my crown?",
  "41971": "Whither are you leading us?",
  "41972": "Are you hungry?",
  "41973": "Give the little lad some more?",
  "41974": "Who caused you to suppose so?",
  "41975": "And in what did all this training end?",
  "41976": "Can it be me?",
  "41977": "But may I ask you one question?",
  "41978": "Went off to die?",
  "41979": "So he has not left his new address?",
  "41980": "I shall?",
  "41981": "My schemes, my labours, and my hopes be vain?",
  "41982": "And what do you mean to do?",
  "41983": "Sally with you too?",
  "41984": "Reader, were you ever present at the examination of a criminal?",
  "41985": "Is there not sad stuff?",

  "42159": "You lodge me in your house, close to yourself like this?",
  "42160": "Do you want me to help you or not?",
  "42161": "But why do you always grip your lips?",

  "42229": "Were the distinction or separation of possessions entirely useless, can any one conceive, that it ever should have obtained in society?",
  "42230": "Yet, after all, what is there in it that should surprise us?",
  "42231": "What would you not tell her?",
  "42232": "Not by his daughter?",
  "42233": "Who wants them?",
  "42234": "Ah, why?",

  "42252": "Do we not wish for an outlet for our surplus population, if I may so express myself?",
  "42253": "Then, as this is the case, and as the knight did really die, how comes it that he now moans and sighs from time to time, as if he were still alive?",
  "42254": "Why should she spare others?",
  "42255": "What may that mean now?",
  "42256": "If she looked favorably upon another, do you mean, monsieur?",
  "42257": "Was he to make her over, to make any portion of her over to others, if, by doing so, she might be able to share the wealth, as well as the coarse manners and uncouth society of her at present unknown connexions?",
  "42258": "How is this strange silence to be accounted for?",
  "42259": "But, putting that aside altogether, what would they live on?",
  "42260": "But how and where?",
  "42261": "Come, will you take me as I am?",
  "42262": "And wherefore?",
  "42263": "What is the matter with me?",
  "42264": "But, pray, when you have been pumped dry one day, what have you got the next?",

  "42296": "Why does it stop there?",
  "42297": "Are you getting about again yet, old fellow?",
  "42298": "Have you any means of transport?",
  "42299": "Why should you put things so bitterly, dearie?",

  "42301": "Are they real?",
  "42302": "And for what purpose?",
  "42303": "Do you suppose the boat will sail promptly?",
  "42304": "What was its standard?",
  "42305": "Do you remember how silent I was on the drive back?",
  "42306": "I ask, therefore, if a man, in this situation, and guilty of these two errors, is to be regarded as vicious and criminal, however unavoidable they might have been?",
  "42307": "Besides, why were they not allowed to escape?",
  "42308": "Were we really there half an hour?",

  "42318": "That he should appear only at that point?",
  "42319": "What are you saying?",
  "42320": "Foolish indeed?",
  "42321": "Quite strong and well, I hope?",
  "42322": "Is his power of speech gone?",
  "42323": "Would he not have done better to have kept the water that he had decomposed in pure loss, in order to sustain him in the air?",
  "42324": "And he might have asked also, where the industry so necessary for such a trade?",
  "42325": "But if I justify it?",

  "42329": "And which I can have?",
  "42330": "For who would understand the work within him?",
  "42331": "The spider?",
  "42332": "Where can we be going in such a tiny pool of water?",
  "42333": "Had you heard that?",
  "42334": "But what then, made her so unhappy?",
  "42335": "No brother at all?",
  "42336": "The question I have to ask myself is, shall I marry him?",

  "42345": "What comes next?",
  "42346": "This prisoner, who was he?",
  "42347": "Do you recollect me?",
  "42348": "The lieutenant of musketeers?",
  "42349": "You wish to be, according to your tastes or private friendships, free to destroy my plans and save my enemies?",
  "42350": "If I be right in this, how could we make any entirely new improvement by means of tonnage duties?",
  "42351": "Wherein differ the sea and the land, that a miracle upon one is not a miracle upon the other?",

  "42359": "What is a fontis?",
  "42360": "And will not their wives be the best women?",
  "42361": "How, then, did you deduce the telegram?",
  "42362": "Which of them, seeing us together here, will believe that our meeting and dancing at the gipsy party was by chance?",
  "42363": "Why should not my father see him?",
  "42364": "I have heard a party was to leave the encampment this morning for the lake shore?",

  "42367": "Beg him to come at once, do you hear?",
  "42368": "What do you do in your cottage when it rains like this?",
  "42369": "If so, what we are afraid of, when we but suspect our enemies will inflict it on us, shall we inflict it on ourselves for certain?",
  "42370": "But where are you going really?",
  "42371": "Did not the sun shine upon him with a halo, so that he was bright as an angel?",
  "42372": "No dinner?",

  "42380": "Why, where ever did you go?",
  "42381": "You mean the rascals?",
  "42382": "Is it really calling us?",
  "42383": "Do they not think, they will have their own ends, and be truer to themselves, than to them?",
  "42384": "What humour's this?",
  "42385": "How about when you lose?",

  "42405": "There were brave men among them, but of what use was courage when their weapons were powerless against the monster?",
  "42406": "Is it a bargain?",
  "42407": "And in the common way of his business does he not expect to be paid for his pictures?",
  "42408": "Who is this youth?",
  "42409": "Not named?",
  "42410": "How can we truly open the doors, and set free the full genius of our people?",
  "42411": "This what?",
  "42412": "We will go up now, shall we?",
  "42413": "But, it will be asked again, can we on these grounds, admit the existence of a wise and omnipotent author of the world?",

  "42819": "What shall I do about it?",
  "42820": "And you did not intercede for him?",
  "42821": "When saw you my niece?",
  "42822": "And, therefore, you would wish to see them brought together?",
  "42823": "You are acquainted with the cardinal's will, then?",
  "42824": "Have you never seen any one enter your room at night?",
  "42825": "If I marry t'oother dear lass, there's a law to punish me?",
  "42826": "But will it be possible for me to find you?",
  "42827": "And has he forgotten his ideal?",
  "42828": "Are you going to stay here yourself?",
  "42829": "Yet, another mug of beer?",
  "42830": "Are we to sneak into the kitchen, as if we came after the forks?",
  "42831": "And are you, in truth, highly magnified?",
  "42832": "Why do you not affirm him?",
  "42833": "What about her?",
  "42834": "And what, think you, does my father feel at this moment?",
  "42835": "Is this playing the game properly?",
  "42836": "But where is the doctor?",
  "42837": "And sit out with him, I suppose?",
  "42838": "What of it?",
  "42839": "Seems we're not going to sleep, then?",
  "42840": "Am I not a man and a brother?",
  "42841": "Are you afraid?",
  "42842": "Champion?",
  "42843": "Match?",
  "42844": "How did you happen to be here?",
  "42845": "Is not such the doom of all speculative men of talent?",
  "42846": "But what does it mean?",
  "42847": "Why, what has he in him of such virtue to be regarded, ha?",
  "42848": "Get on, will you?",
  "42849": "Yea, forsooth?",
  "42850": "And, considering the question of human happiness, where, oh where does it reside?",
  "42851": "Aramis?",
  "42852": "But why do you not rise and greet your guest?",
  "42853": "Why did you not give up that lewd habit, that impure habit?",
  "42854": "So that's it, is it?",
  "42855": "Where do you fish, my friends?",
  "42856": "Is he the same toward the other mummies in the house?",
  "42857": "Who's the next?",
  "42858": "But are you seriously wounded?",
  "42859": "But can it last?",
  "42860": "Why should she fight against every admission until it was forced from her?",
  "42861": "Well, who knows?",
  "42862": "Whether they or their judges had any part in penning those laws, which they assumed the liberty of interpreting, and glossing upon at their pleasure?",
  "42863": "And what the spirit that leads us wants TO BE CALLED?",
  "42864": "What has he made me suffer?",
  "42865": "Who made it?",
  "42866": "What is it you want me to do?",
  "42867": "What on earth became of all these people?",
  "42868": "Or would he spread bat's wings and flee away, looking so much the uglier the higher he rose towards heaven?",
  "42869": "Are you confirmed in your impression?",
  "42870": "Do you think they will grant it?",
  "42871": "Which is the way?",
  "42872": "When must I leave?",
  "42873": "Is that you?",
  "42874": "Yet, what can the votary be justly said to have lost of his present happiness?",
  "42875": "Or what other reason can we ever assign for these affections, but the original fabric and formation of the human mind, which is naturally adapted to receive them?",
  "42876": "And yet, what is life worth to you if you be deprived of these enjoyments?",
  "42877": "Are they here?",
  "42878": "What matters it, if you avoid them?",
  "42879": "With the girl and all?",
  "42880": "You have had your eye on the business, my young friend, have you?",
  "42881": "Does the body correspond so immediately with the spirit?",
  "42882": "And what are you going to buy for it?",
  "42883": "And therefore, previously?",
  "42884": "And long ago?",
  "42885": "How much?",
  "42886": "A name?",
  "42887": "Or that induces the patriot to die for his country?",
  "42888": "To carry this accusing witness about with me everywhere?",
  "42889": "Then I must give up the idea?",
  "42890": "Is it intelligent?",
  "42891": "What good, pray, would this do you?",
  "42892": "Do you doubt my being what I always have been to you?",
  "42893": "How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love?",
  "42894": "Was it all real?",
  "42895": "Am I right behind, mama?",
  "42896": "George?",
  "42897": "But do you not admire, I said, the coolness and dexterity of these ready ministers of political corruption?",
  "42898": "Was he fair or dark?",
  "42899": "Would you?",
  "42900": "Do you agree to it?",
  "42901": "It was the cardinal, then, who informed you of this fete?",
  "42902": "Can you really remember it all?",
  "42903": "Angina?",
  "42904": "Then he said, she came from the country, he saw?",
  "42905": "And see the blue heron by the lotus flowers?",
  "42906": "Oh, you are, are you?",
  "42907": "Was it soil?",
  "42908": "Is it not a pitiful sight?",
  "42909": "How did you make your way in here?",
  "42910": "D'you call life a bad job?",
  "42911": "You will not be my comforter, my rescuer?",
  "42912": "And who were the others?",
  "42913": "Do you understand?",
  "42914": "How much does he spend yearly?",
  "42915": "O, was it no otherwise?",
  "42916": "How could I doubt such a thing?",
  "42917": "How many children have you got, ma'am?",
  "42918": "Why not, if you like it?",
  "42919": "How dare you cross my threshold?",
  "42920": "You'll like that?",
  "42921": "And is her name a secret?",
  "42922": "Uneasy?",
  "42923": "But how came you upon the roof, man?",
  "42924": "La sakes, now, does it?",
  "42925": "Hear you?",
  "42926": "Will they never cease to expect corn from tares, and figs from thistles?",
  "42927": "Why SHOULD you hold out forever?",
  "42928": "Then what was it?",
  "42929": "Else, why should it be let so cheaply?",
  "42930": "Is it possible that there can be many such people on earth?",
  "42931": "And might a man be thirsty, and yet unwilling to drink?",
  "42932": "What is the secret, then?",
  "42933": "But was it on her own account, or on account of another, that she exposed herself to such hazards?",
  "42934": "Shall I tell YOU?",
  "42935": "Whuzzamatter wiz you, hey?",
  "42936": "And you have heard his fortune mentioned?",
  "42937": "Is there in the world, anything outside of the tribunals, executory sentences, the police and the authorities?",
  "42938": "Yeobright?",
  "42939": "Do you accept the wager?",
  "42940": "Now, who the deuce do I know?",
  "42941": "Very well, sir, what next?",
  "42942": "Can it be possible to see anything equal to what we have seen?",
  "42943": "Ha, what is he, man?",
  "42944": "You are pretty strong, eh?",
  "42945": "Why such a large land army?",
  "42946": "What is it my father does not know?",
  "42947": "Is their spiritual condition, I often wonder, much higher than their physical one?",
  "42948": "Heard what?",
  "42949": "Shall I describe his life to you?",
  "42950": "Would they stop short at the hairy cuticle, or would they attack the brain?",
  "42951": "How long then?",
  "42952": "My letter?",
  "42953": "Is he as soft as ever?",
  "42954": "You'll keep that?",
  "42955": "Where were you thinking of going?",
  "42956": "Do you hear the guns, pray?",
  "42957": "Should we not rather say JURISIGNORANCE?",
  "42958": "For what is it we call a man of birth, but one who is descended from a long succession of rich and powerful ancestors, and who acquires our esteem by his connexion with persons whom we esteem?",
  "42959": "But what about a thing like this?",
  "42960": "Was not that better than taking him prisoner?",
  "42961": "What was the name that he mentioned?",
  "42962": "Are you ready to be tested?",
  "42963": "How could I have exposed myself in their presence?",
  "42964": "Shall I see if we can manage that?",
  "42965": "Marguerite, CHERIE, what is it?",
  "42966": "Done?",
  "42967": "My dear archdeacon, who ever expected to see you?",
  "42968": "Why, have you not got any water?",
  "42969": "How could he hope to escape them?",
  "42970": "Here I have served him faithfully for years, and instead of allowing me to end my days comfortably and in peace, he is going to let me be cut up by the butcher, and my poor body is to be roasted and stewed and eaten?",
  "42971": "Now, how little do I look like being carried away trembling?",
  "42972": "To men who had risked their lives for him, and besides had done him a great service?",
  "42973": "What's the matter now?",
  "42974": "Is it to be so?",
  "42975": "This morning was it?",
  "42976": "What other thing do you think I could dream of doing?",
  "42977": "Which house is it?",
  "42978": "By whom?",
  "42979": "But has the problem been well put?",
  "42980": "Could any thing in womanhood be so vile?",
  "42981": "There were two parts in our former scheme of education, were there not?",
  "42982": "Shall I tell you what I always think of you and the fortune yet to come for you, my love?",
  "42983": "Who is the fellow?",
  "42984": "Pleased to be thus undeceived, I laughed at his consternation, and asked what brought him thither?",
  "42985": "Was he losing his reason and thinking he heard things which were not for human ears?",
  "42986": "How far may the idler take advantage of the laborer?",
  "42987": "Why are you going?",
  "42988": "Perhaps you could stop stuffing your nostrils with that dirty snuff?",
  "42989": "What became of the whales in that time?",
  "42990": "Who could attempt to pursue him?",
  "42991": "Genius banished?",
  "42992": "How dare I?",
  "42993": "Well, prince, whom are we to suspect, then?",
  "42994": "I think you had some good reason for giving up the habit of going there?",
  "42995": "What day of the month is it?",
  "42996": "Is he mad, then, that mysterious old fellow?",
  "42997": "But what sort of a sailor are you?",
  "42998": "Who can resist them?",
  "42999": "You think the count will be angry with me?",
  "43000": "But where?",
  "43001": "Did you ever hear the like?",
  "43002": "Who is this man?",
  "43003": "Who wishes you would?",
  "43004": "Is he here now?",
  "43005": "What was it you said to me?",
  "43006": "You in bed?",
  "43007": "Am I wanted?",
  "43008": "How came you to be here?",
  "43009": "Can they have gone out?",
  "43010": "Is it of being poor, forsaken, wretched, that you accuse me?",
  "43011": "Did it change her much?",
  "43012": "What was jour offence?",
  "43013": "Who forbade you?",
  "43014": "What is your name, my gentle angel?",
  "43015": "In the sunshine of the morning, beneath the wide, blue heavens, with a fresh wind astir, what fears, except the most desperate, can find a harbourage?",
  "43016": "So this is our minstrel?",
  "43017": "Yes, why should I stay here?",
  "43018": "Were you then permitted the use of pens, ink, and paper?",
  "43019": "What do you do?",
  "43020": "A dog, for instance?",
  "43021": "Can the cannon support the shock of the pyroxyle?",
  "43022": "Have I ever done that?",
  "43023": "Was there any large school near?",
  "43024": "But are they rich?",
  "43025": "What decision did he come to?",
  "43026": "How can I bear it?",
  "43027": "What am I to say to the creature?",
  "43028": "How would you like to be treated so?",
  "43029": "Is there any one closer to me nor you, or is it likely I'd be listening to stories brought against you?",
  "43030": "And can you not see, sir, the truth that's in me?",
  "43031": "Well, young fellow, are you glad to come to school?",
  "43032": "As how, good signior?",
  "43033": "Has not that been admitted?",
  "43034": "At a registrar's?",
  "43035": "Have you read this bulletin?",
  "43036": "He of whom I have such just apprehensions?",
  "43037": "Did a woman arrive at this place night before last?",
  "43038": "Does anything occur to yourself?",
  "43039": "Then what are they?",
  "43040": "Your father, eh?",
  "43041": "Have they not obeyed me?",
  "43042": "What have you got, broth, is it?",
  "43043": "Where are my amusements?",
  "43044": "What has a father to do with it?",
  "43045": "Do I take you with me?",
  "43046": "Do you understand the theory of that affair?",
  "43047": "Do you hear the way she'll be rating at your own self when a week is by?",
  "43048": "But, still, what sort of danger?",
  "43049": "No more than this?",
  "43050": "Where were the keys?",
  "43051": "Nobody know what this fudge can be?",
  "43052": "Come, what is it?",
  "43053": "Is loyalty too weak?",
  "43054": "What result, then, has ensued?",
  "43055": "Would not it be said by my presumptive remorse that, by my gallantry, manner and dress, I was going to seduce her?",
  "43056": "Never before?",
  "43057": "What do you mean, please, by my having 'done' with you?",
  "43058": "To who, sir?",
  "43059": "Did they try it on you?",
  "43060": "Are you thirsty?",
  "43061": "Will monseigneur give me the order?",
  "43062": "Where is the gardener's son now?",
  "43063": "Would it not be well that he should put an end to himself, and thus escape?",
  "43064": "Is it not generous of him?",
  "43065": "What is the matter with you?",
  "43066": "You hear them when the window is open?",
  "43067": "You can?",
  "43068": "Now, what is the good of driblets?",
  "43069": "I'm not come too soon, am I?",
  "43070": "In fact, this bullet must have issued from a firearm, and who but a human being could have used such a weapon?",
  "43071": "Then you sat there like that, just you and she, all by yourselves?",
  "43072": "Why have I not seen you?",
  "43073": "Do you guess the reason?",
  "43074": "Is the one right any better than the other?",
  "43075": "Am I cut off from the last fond pride of meanest shipwrecked captains?",
  "43076": "What is it, uncle?",
  "43077": "Is it my doing?",
  "43078": "To which dialect was he indebted?",
  "43079": "Can you play on the piano?",
  "43080": "You have no money coming in on which you can rely?",
  "43081": "From such a kind family?",
  "43082": "Why did you leave us?",
  "43083": "Who was there among all whom she knew to whom she could appeal for sympathy?",
  "43084": "Well, and you?",
  "43085": "Do I not know that, all the country round, men and woman are calling me the same behind my back?",
  "43086": "Who are these people on the side of the bill?",
  "43087": "But what is it, then?",
  "43088": "But who, then was this man?",
  "43089": "Then they do not know it yet?",
  "43090": "Be so kind as to walk home with him, will you?",
  "43091": "Richard?",
  "43092": "What is a prison?",
  "43093": "Are you sure?",
  "43094": "Oh, will you be quiet, and help me to carry her?",
  "43095": "Have you not read your bulletin?",
  "43096": "Shall domestic manufactures be encouraged, and in what degree, by restrictions on foreign manufactures?",
  "43097": "Or shall we say they may be continued as long as the danger which occasioned their being raised continues?",
  "43098": "Can you tell me any ill he has done?",
  "43099": "What is government?",
  "43100": "How could I forget?",
  "43101": "Hoo wor it?",
  "43102": "But why should they suppose that I despise generals?",
  "43103": "So both the brothers escaped the common fate?",
  "43104": "Where are we to live?",
  "43105": "What reason do they give?",
  "43106": "Do you suppose I want to shoot myself?",
  "43107": "Whether they were always so free from avarice, partialities, or want, that a bribe, or some other sinister view, could have no place among them?",
  "43108": "Is it not good?",
  "43109": "Was that a trick to make me say which one I prefer?",
  "43110": "And get enchanted again?",
  "43111": "Why not, if what you assert is untrue?",
  "43112": "What's the odds where it comes from?",
  "43113": "Could she go back to the former quiet pleasures of those faraway days before the concert?",
  "43114": "Well, will you go if I change my clothes?",
  "43115": "Oh, he mentioned his name, did he?",
  "43116": "Can you let me sit by the fire?",
  "43117": "Then how?",
  "43118": "How is it possible to hear her?",
  "43119": "How are we going to get back?",
  "43120": "Need you say it face to face?",
  "43121": "Wooster?",
  "43122": "Will he get used to it?",
  "43123": "Who may the four be?",
  "43124": "Do I look as if I liked it?",
  "43125": "Well, is it good?",
  "43126": "Then a man may feel for years that he is good solid company, and be wrong about himself after all?",
  "43127": "Are we only half way up?",
  "43128": "Pray, when, sir, shall I see you at my house?",
  "43129": "But when is this ball to take place?",
  "43130": "And my son?",
  "43131": "But will you gi'e me all the ground the goose flew over?",
  "43132": "Who denies you this right?",
  "43133": "What is the rule in such a case?",
  "43134": "How do you mean to live then?",
  "43135": "Can you guess how he will be likely to behave towards his flatterers and his supposed parents, first of all during the period when he is ignorant of the false relation, and then again when he knows?",
  "43136": "If you see us among scores of women, will you look upon us?",
  "43137": "Where does the remainder go?",
  "43138": "Did any of you see him trailing us?",
  "43139": "And was he sure of what he said?",
  "43140": "I wrote to you for some grammars, if you recollect, and you sent them?",
  "43141": "But shall we go down and watch this absorbing match?",
  "43142": "My plans?",
  "43143": "And who had deserved the worst?",
  "43144": "Do you believe in my instinctive feelings?",
  "43145": "Are you sure I can get all the things I want there?",
  "43146": "On the front?",
  "43147": "Do you not see then, sire, that this is a covert and indirect accusation against yourself, and that while he praises pardoning love, he at the same time condemns and accuses your righteous and punitory wrath?",
  "43148": "Why weary, and palsy the arm at the oar, and the iron, and the lance?",
  "43149": "Her father, eh?",
  "43150": "What difference did it make?",
  "43151": "Are my purposes wont to be so shallow?",
  "43152": "Have you had any tea, by the by?",
  "43153": "What promise?",
  "43154": "Who finds them?",
  "43155": "What are you doing there, my friend?",
  "43156": "Did you treat anybody, sir?",
  "43157": "May I?",
  "43158": "And why was I running after her?",
  "43159": "What if the acts he had reconciled himself to because they made him a stronger instrument of the divine glory, were to become the pretext of the scoffer, and a darkening of that glory?",
  "43160": "Shall history be blind to such fatality as this?",
  "43161": "Must I ever be on the way?",
  "43162": "But could you BEAR to have it swinging to your boat?",
  "43163": "Why, what's the reason, sir?",
  "43164": "What might I not get to know, nearly concerning you?",
  "43165": "What do they mean?",
  "43166": "What do they want?",
  "43167": "What is it like?",
  "43168": "And do you care?",
  "43169": "Count on my assistance?",
  "43170": "Where are they to be found?",
  "43171": "Must I always be the same?",
  "43172": "Why, pray, did you laugh at this?",
  "43173": "And were you warm?",
  "43174": "Where are we?",
  "43175": "If I told her all my fortune is lost?",
  "43176": "Who is a foolish man?",
  "43177": "What matter?",
  "43178": "Have you anything to say to me?",
  "43179": "Who are you?",
  "43180": "What was he doing?",
  "43181": "So you and the cardinal have been talking about me?",
  "43182": "Have we not botanical gardens?",
  "43183": "Why will you increase my distress by this groundless dispute?",
  "43184": "Is that called a funnel?",
  "43185": "Do they look like that sort of thing?",
  "43186": "How shall I ever repay you?",
  "43187": "Are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and reconciliation?",
  "43188": "Fwhat's she doin' outside?",
  "43189": "And what do you know about the state you talk of?",
  "43190": "Can any man of serious reflection hazard his future happiness upon the belief of a story naturally impossible, repugnant to every idea of decency, and related by persons already detected of falsehood?",
  "43191": "And why should I hesitate to betray that monster, sir?",
  "43192": "Nay, what is there that is not open to your very enemies?",
  "43193": "What is she to us?",
  "43194": "What are you?",
  "43195": "Am I to pay the piper?",
  "43196": "Who's up stairs, you dog?",
  "43197": "Who is this beauty and where is she to be seen, when she was not seen before till you saw her, if you did see her?",
  "43198": "Is it to do us some ill turn?",
  "43199": "What is it they're going to play?",
  "43200": "You wretch, eat up your visitors in your own house?",
  "43201": "Who's she?",
  "43202": "Where and when have you seen me trifle with a friend's heart and a king's life?",
  "43203": "Even when no one can hear us, may I, by no syllable, by none, not the slightest intimation, remind you of our love?",
  "43204": "Yes, it is a child, but who brought it here?",
  "43205": "Eh?",
  "43206": "Have you made anything out of the tangle?",
  "43207": "Am I to be left here in my old age, not a rational soul to speak to, and no other place in the village where there's a drop of decent punch to be had?",
  "43208": "What are you making such a fuss about?",
  "43209": "Well, then, whom does it concern?",
  "43210": "Do you not deduce something from that?",
  "43211": "But who could have taken it?",
  "43212": "One figure whose movements you follow with at least curiosity?",

  "43604": "My I speak frankly to you?",
  "43605": "Succeeds it, or no?",
  "43606": "It may well be asked how is it possible to reconcile this case with the theory of natural selection?",
  "43607": "How do you know, then?",
  "43608": "Is it not a horrible caprice?",
  "43609": "Careful of what, may I ask?",
  "43610": "How can I?",
  "43611": "Where were to be lodged all the gentry of the neighborhood, who would gather in two or three hours after the news had enlarged the circle of its report, like the increasing circumference produced by a stone thrown into a placid lake?",
  "43612": "What do you think of him?",
  "43613": "Pomotou?",
  "43614": "Does it please the venerable one to listen to me for one moment longer?",
  "43615": "Now, how many tickets will you take?",
  "43616": "Hwarof kalenges tu me?",
  "43617": "Have you nothing more to say?",
  "43618": "And if there is no change in the situation, will not the future always be a deplorable copy of the past?",
  "43619": "Why repeat their visit?",
  "43620": "Is there anything at all behind that impassive face?",
  "43621": "How, again, would he take the news of his son's good fortune?",
  "43622": "Do you mean that your wife and you wish to leave?",
  "43623": "Have we followed that road?",
  "43624": "What makes you look so flurried?",
  "43625": "If they have perceived it, why have they neglected to condemn it?",
  "43626": "But does such an event lie sufficiently within the bounds of probability to justify the belief in its occurrence on the strength of any attainable, or, indeed, imaginable, evidence?",
  "43627": "Feel yourself guilty?",
  "43628": "Have you no remembrance of the occasion?",
  "43629": "Have I not told you so, gentlemen?",
  "43630": "Will there really be a trousseau and all that?",
  "43631": "What, lady, is the cause of your alarm?",
  "43632": "Whom are you going to marry?",
  "43633": "Is that all, monseigneur?",
  "43634": "Do you guess that I have come to remind you of a promise?",
  "43635": "What do you mean by all three?",
  "43636": "Stolen?",
  "43637": "Did I not always say so, archdeacon?",
  "43638": "Vot is cum'd to mein pipe?",
  "43639": "Can you imagine a crab as large as yonder table, with its many legs moving slowly and uncertainly, its big claws swaying, its long antennae, like carters' whips, waving and feeling, and its stalked eyes gleaming at you on either side of its metallic front?",
  "43640": "Do you not suspect this young man of having given bad counsel?",
  "43641": "Any one with you?",
  "43642": "What could he talk about?",
  "43643": "Which years do you mean to include?",
  "43644": "How can it fail to draw the father and mother nearer?",
  "43645": "Would it not be well to hear what I have to say?",
  "43646": "Why should they look for me?",
  "43647": "When did she die?",
  "43648": "And who thinks of using him ill?",
  "43649": "Why in the world not?",
  "43650": "Has he asked for me?",
  "43651": "Then may I go and tell him, sir?",
  "43652": "Why pine not I, and die in this distress?",
  "43653": "Shall I take you in my arms?",
  "43654": "Mussels too?",
  "43655": "How does it feel?",
  "43656": "Hudson?",
  "43657": "Are you stopping at your old quarters?",
  "43658": "But what is all this?",
  "43659": "Tom, have you got on the track of that money again?",
  "43660": "Of what was he guilty?",
  "43661": "Am I still bound to her?",
  "43662": "You have not an umbrella that I can use as a stick?",
  "43663": "You were asking, then?",
  "43664": "Is this the time to sing?",
  "43665": "And who will do it for me?",
  "43666": "Is it to the judge or to the husband?",
  "43667": "Staunton?",
  "43668": "Saw it?",
  "43669": "How have I flown to the height where no rabble any longer sit at the wells?",
  "43670": "Why do you do that?",
  "43671": "Burned?",
  "43672": "Has the host told you nothing, then?",
  "43673": "How could I have mistook you?",
  "43674": "Does she, indeed?",
  "43675": "What are his means of existence?",
  "43676": "And she will hold her tongue?",
  "43677": "Would not the first of them who saw me wring my neck like a snipe's?",
  "43678": "How should I know?",
  "43679": "Was it her hairdresser who had escaped from a bear, or was it a bear who had escaped from her hairdresser's?",
  "43680": "What house?",
  "43681": "It is, eh?",
  "43682": "And then, when she heard how true he was, how he persisted against father, mother, and sisters, how could it be that that should not be a merit in her eyes which was so great a fault in theirs?",
  "43683": "Do you think we'd have let them know about it?",
  "43684": "And now, is it all over between us?",
  "43685": "And it was very natural that she should, for having so few sentiments in common, when the sexual tie was broken, what was to hold her?",
  "43686": "Have you no husband?",
  "43687": "O my dear friend, how can I enumerate the benefits that I have received from your goodness?",
  "43688": "And are enemies also to receive what we owe to them?",
  "43689": "When he is by himself he will not mind saying or doing many things which he would be ashamed of any one hearing or seeing him do?",
  "43690": "Is the nurse here?",
  "43691": "Was he not employing all his legal prerogatives, and many prerogatives which were not legal, for the purpose of forcing his subjects to conform to his creed?",
  "43692": "How was that made?",
  "43693": "Silly question?",
  "43694": "Congratulate him on what?",
  "43695": "Then where the devil is the woman?",
  "43696": "Of what use would such sacrifice be?",
  "43697": "What is the matter with you, my angel?",
  "43698": "Who told you of him?",
  "43699": "What, under such circumstances, could have been expected even from a man gifted with great talents?",
  "43700": "I was willin' a long time, sir?",
  "43701": "And can we deliver our friend?",
  "43702": "Could there be finer symptoms?",
  "43703": "Will you let us in?",
  "43704": "I suppose he is right in what he tells us now?",
  "43705": "What is the meaning of all this?",
  "43706": "But how can one help it, monsieur, when one has worked all one's life?",
  "43707": "What do you call her, doctor?",
  "43708": "Who does he mean?",
  "43709": "Could you swear to it?",
  "43710": "What, do you confess, then?",
  "43711": "Is that bill real?",
  "43712": "Then where is the butter jar?",
  "43713": "Do you believe me?",
  "43714": "My question is only whether the just man, while refusing to have more than another just man, would wish and claim to have more than the unjust?",
  "43715": "What can I do to save you?",
  "43716": "And what if they are?",
  "43717": "Has he recognized me?",
  "43718": "Do you hear what he says?",
  "43719": "You want to go to your uncle?",
  "43720": "Do you begin, a little, to be satisfied?",
  "43721": "What's come to your lead?",
  "43722": "Am I that?",
  "43723": "Well, my dear fellow, so you still want to be an adjutant?",
  "43724": "Maybe you could get something in the stage line?",
  "43725": "How much is the bottle?",
  "43726": "Who are those people?",
  "43727": "Come, who is my father?",
  "43728": "Why this interest?",
  "43729": "And what answer did you get?",
  "43730": "Will you kindly gif me a word of taste and help?",
  "43731": "Will you do that?",
  "43732": "Is it so?",
  "43733": "You remember the hat beside the dead man?",
  "43734": "What shall we do now, my son?",
  "43735": "You are referring to the demands of the rebels and to the tone in which they stated them?",
  "43736": "Now, really, let me ask, sir, have you?",
  "43737": "But, in admitting that the sun does not go out, might it not happen that the earth might move away from it?",
  "43738": "Do you mean where have I been while supper was getting ready?",
  "43739": "So, you will go?",
  "43740": "What's that writing about, eh?",
  "43741": "What chance brings you here, gentlemen?",
  "43742": "And, when so weighed, were they ever to kick the beam like feathers?",
  "43743": "What would he with vs?",
  "43744": "Would they soon be coming?",
  "43745": "Will you allow no affection, no love on my side, where there has been so much on your side?",
  "43746": "You, you poor creature, what good would you do?",
  "43747": "How will he live?",
  "43748": "Have you weaned her yet?",
  "43749": "Is there still no end to the bloodshed?",
  "43750": "Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up to the grand northern lights?",
  "43751": "Do you believe there is a consideration in the world that would induce her to take such a step against her favourite son?",
  "43752": "What is he looking at?",
  "43753": "But was not her father the head of the community?",
  "43754": "How could you be so careless?",
  "43755": "What are we to do?",
  "43756": "How is your life in danger here?",
  "43757": "Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?",
  "43758": "Again, upon the supposition that the soul is a harmony, why is one soul better than another?",
  "43759": "How did I deserve such pay?",
  "43760": "Where did he get out?",
  "43761": "Never mind, you know when monsieur le comte will return, at least?",
  "43762": "What was passing in that receptive childlike soul that so eagerly caught and assimilated all the diverse impressions of life?",
  "43763": "Which is which?",
  "43764": "I have been betrayed or denounced, then?",
  "43765": "Andy, where's your gun?",
  "43766": "So much as that?",
  "43767": "And have whole streams of blood been spilt in vain?",
  "43768": "But what is there to say about me?",
  "43769": "How were we going to begin to bring order out of this chaos?",
  "43770": "Do you recognize the carriage?",
  "43771": "Why was she stumbling about amongst the rubble and catching her dress in brambles and burrs?",
  "43772": "Which driver was going to drive the carriage and which the cart?",
  "43773": "Who has clothed the earth in its beauty?",
  "43774": "Who a cuss cares what he knows?",
  "43775": "Zakhar is shouting that I should turn to the left, but why to the left?",
  "43776": "You believe in nothing visible, except grass and birds?",
  "43777": "But that column of water?",
  "43778": "How did you know it was the country?",
  "43779": "Were you comfortable together?",
  "43780": "May I stay a little longer?",
  "43781": "Will you become a suitor to her for her hand?",
  "43782": "What, to marry in an inn, and at night too?",
  "43783": "Well, where are we to go to now, father?",
  "43784": "Would you do me the favor of stepping into the shop?",
  "43785": "You see the stairs afore you?",
  "43786": "What will your relatives say to see me in a crumpled collar?",
  "43787": "To READ?",
  "43788": "The empty one?",
  "43789": "Where shall we meet again?",
  "43790": "Anyways, your reverence will call for me coming back?",
  "43791": "The earth?",
  "43792": "What unforseen events might not open his prison door, and restore him to liberty?",
  "43793": "Why will you have nothing to do with me?",
  "43794": "Was it prudence?",
  "43795": "Can we imagine it possible, that while human nature remains the same, men will ever become entirely indifferent to their power, riches, beauty or personal merit, and that their pride and vanity will not be affected by these advantages?",
  "43796": "Well, sir, what can I do?",
  "43797": "But where to now?",
  "43798": "Aramis here?",
  "43799": "How can you imagine it, since he has so lately declined everything from you?",
  "43800": "And what for?",
  "43801": "There's no likelihood of her running away or eloping?",
  "43802": "But who can see her as I have seen, who can know what her life has been, and not love her?",
  "43803": "Do you think any hint has reached her?",
  "43804": "Was that real or not?",
  "43805": "And will any duchess or countess rank with her?",
  "43806": "You are keeping the school there again, just as formerly?",
  "43807": "Worked here before?",
  "43808": "Peggotty go away from you?",
  "43809": "And in the sun?",
  "43810": "Have you not?",
  "43811": "Which field?",
  "43812": "How dare you trespass?",
  "43813": "What do you do in the circus?",
  "43814": "How could I understand all human affairs, ancient and modern, in the world?",
  "43815": "What is the good of your stars and trees, your sunrise and the wind, if they do not enter into our daily lives?",
  "43816": "My dear boys, what are you thinking about?",
  "43817": "I asked you if you knew him?",
  "43818": "What was it?",
  "43819": "And what of the country's people?",
  "43820": "And will you allow me the privilege of an old friend, of looking in upon you now and then?",
  "43821": "But do you believe you could arrest the progress of two horses rushing forwards with ungovernable fury?",
  "43822": "Stop, you wicked man, why did you look into the forbidden room?",
  "43823": "Has he lost his wealth at sea?",
  "43824": "Mercedes?",
  "43825": "Who told you that, my dear?",
  "43826": "How could one not love him?",
  "43827": "Silent still?",
  "43828": "Was it actually in the room?",
  "43829": "But on which side is truth?",
  "43830": "Would it not have been better that we should remain friends?",
  "43831": "But how can we follow him?",
  "43832": "Do you mean to state what your complaint against this boy is, man, or do you not?",
  "43833": "Now what?",
  "43834": "What did he see?",
  "43835": "Is it not the rushing of the wolves you have mentioned?",
  "43836": "For what?",
  "43837": "Should he impose his galleys on those two dazzling children, or should he consummate his irremediable engulfment by himself?",
  "43838": "Where do you hide 'em?",
  "43839": "What mercies or what sins of men are you talking of?",
  "43840": "Do you require the word?",
  "43841": "What place and what season can be goodlier than this?",
  "43842": "To what do you allude, monsieur?",
  "43843": "Poor fellow, what is it?",
  "43844": "Liver out of order?",
  "43845": "After what they had seen, could the travelers solve it?",
  "43846": "Did I think them stupid, obscure, inexact?",
  "43847": "Quis vatum discursus erat?",
  "43848": "What were they all?",
  "43849": "Have you been, or are you, his mistress?",
  "43850": "And why did you behave thus about my portrait?",
  "43851": "And how for that?",
  "43852": "She said not, but who could tell what was truth which came from those lips, or if that corrupt heart was in this case pure?",
  "43853": "Have you heard the news?",
  "43854": "Will you kindly tell us which way your mother went to get on top the earth?",
  "43855": "Is that what you have made of him?",
  "43856": "It feels nervous and strange to be coming here again after all these years?",
  "43857": "Who was she that he danced with?",
  "43858": "How many persons is the prison built to hold?",
  "43859": "But what can he do?",
  "43860": "And what are those words THERE, on THAT line?",
  "43861": "Is that really you?",
  "43862": "How'd they act?",
  "43863": "Has it come to pass that you have buried yourself entirely?",
  "43864": "How is it pointing?",
  "43865": "Change places with him, and would you have been looked at by those blue eyes as he was, and commiserated by that agitated face as he was?",
  "43866": "Is that your conclusion, lieutenant?",
  "43867": "What qualities have you, my friend, which would make your services so valuable?",
  "43868": "And may we not say the same of all things?",
  "43869": "And then if we look at things from a still more lofty point of view, why do we speak of civil war?",
  "43870": "Where did her dignity come from?",
  "43871": "Do you know what the question is here?",
  "43872": "Why, what harm was there in that?",
  "43873": "Do you really mean you had ever rented it?",
  "43874": "You will let me know?",
  "43875": "Is commerce of importance to national wealth?",
  "43876": "Who cares a button for our national ideas, any more than for our national bowler hat?",
  "43877": "Out of pure lightness of heart?",
  "43878": "For what is it you're wanting him, my poor man?",
  "43879": "You hear her?",
  "43880": "Are you mad, to talk to me thus?",
  "43881": "How is it that from beauty I have derived a type of unloveliness?",
  "43882": "Does his island produce him such a revenue?",
  "43883": "Can he give any definition of it, that will not be the same with that of causation?",
  "43884": "For two good names, hey?",
  "43885": "Another round?",
  "43886": "What did he write it with?",
  "43887": "Whom have you got o' board?",
  "43888": "What are you up to now?",
  "43889": "What do I think?",
  "43890": "Why's that?",
  "43891": "Who, condemns justice and humanity in the abstract?",
  "43892": "Who asked you to try to persuade me to marry him?",
  "43893": "But what was the nature of this emotion?",
  "43894": "War?",
  "43895": "For if he be capable of attending his brother to the mount, why is he not made prefect of the city?",
  "43896": "Where is he to go?",
  "43897": "Where will you be with the grammars?",
  "43898": "Do you want to make out that you love them BOTH?",
  "43899": "Et ubi prenus?",
  "43900": "Must I do that?",
  "43901": "How is that all too brief period spent at present?",
  "43902": "What do we here?",
  "43903": "Been back long?",
  "43904": "Lyon?",
  "43905": "Why, what?",
  "43906": "What more is to be said?",
  "43907": "You would, would you?",
  "43908": "What do you mean by special privileges?",
  "43909": "And pray, what sort of a road may that be?",
  "43910": "I?",
  "43911": "And what do those girls do?",
  "43912": "Now did I say anything of the sort?",
  "43913": "Why should I spare him?",
  "43914": "How happens it, if man is good, that he has not succeeded in levelling by his goodness this wholly metaphysical obstacle, and that, instead of strengthening the fraternal tie that binds men, pitiless necessity breaks it?",
  "43915": "But how can the steersman follow the route in the middle of the waters?",
  "43916": "Go long, will ye?",
  "43917": "How do you feel now, ma'am?",
  "43918": "In a moment?",
  "43919": "What force made men act so?",
  "43920": "Do you mean, for example, that he who is mistaken about the sick is a physician in that he is mistaken?",
  "43921": "What would happen in the desolate darkness?",
  "43922": "A venial, or a mortal, sin?",
  "43923": "Who's to doom, when the judge himself is dragged to the bar?",
  "43924": "And that is all?",
  "43925": "Is that the lad?",
  "43926": "Well, how could that injure me, abbe?",
  "43927": "You'll stay to tea?",
  "43928": "How is it that the more easily I can be taxed the sooner I shall be provided?",
  "43929": "Nothing more?",
  "43930": "Will you not take a chair nearer to the fire?",
  "43931": "But what signifies it all?",
  "43932": "Who shot him, then?",
  "43933": "And if they be, what then?",
  "43934": "What do you intend doing with me?",
  "43935": "What has he done?",
  "43936": "The king?",
  "43937": "Shall we restore the dollar to its former gold content?",
  "43938": "Did you know about it?",
  "43939": "Did you do that?",
  "43940": "Is there not?",
  "43941": "When did you first feel that?",
  "43942": "You have not dined?",
  "43943": "Am I ill?",
  "43944": "Was not this perhaps why he became an artillery officer?",
  "43945": "Will you go away and never molest her further?",
  "43946": "Will he not come out, think you?",
  "43947": "Could the finger prints of an ape be detected from those of a man?",

  "43951": "What other means could I employ?",
  "43952": "But what did you want?",
  "43953": "Where have you been all the time?",
  "43954": "And does the girl like you?",
  "43955": "Perhaps some cave, which it would be advisable to explore, existed there?",
  "43956": "What is your age?",
  "43957": "Would she not have made an admirable queen?",
  "43958": "Why should she defer the answer?",
  "43959": "And you have no doubt that it is your husband's hand, madam?",
  "43960": "He does?",
  "43961": "You, who have arranged your infernal plans, and removed the beverages with a talent and precision almost miraculous?",
  "43962": "Surely you must feel how easy it is for you to insult me?",
  "43963": "My name?",
  "43964": "Where's the policeman?",
  "43965": "But is he sure that his son is dead?",
  "43966": "A pipe, then?",
  "43967": "Would they decide for or against it?",
  "43968": "Not finally?",
  "43969": "Those who wish to benefit foreign producers are much more likely to secure that result by continuing the present enormous purchasing power which comes from our prosperity that hall?",
  "43970": "You will, of course, ask 'where is the connexion?",
  "43971": "Fail I alone, in words and deeds?",
  "43972": "For if they cannot, what possibly can become of them?",
  "43973": "Have I not told you that was my business?",
  "43974": "But what would you have in place of it?",
  "43975": "So that is the fate in store for us?",
  "43976": "What would your poor father say?",
  "43977": "What's the matter here, my dear?",
  "43978": "What shall I do now?",
  "43979": "Ask' you?",
  "43980": "Has he gone off?",
  "43981": "What is her name?",
  "43982": "What would you have here?",
  "43983": "Why came they to see me with such an equipage?",
  "43984": "What on earth are you talking about?",
  "43985": "Where do you suppose they all go to?",
  "43986": "You can do that, of course?",
  "43987": "What am I to do on this earth?",
  "43988": "Do you think he did it on purpose?",

  "43990": "Well, well, well, what?",
  "43991": "And who wishes to speak with me?",
  "43992": "Am I dreaming?",
  "43993": "Why, rising by the roadside here, do you the colors greet?",
  "43994": "Who can tell, your honor?",
  "43995": "I wonder what I should be like then?",
  "43996": "What mean you, lords?",
  "43997": "But he was right?",
  "43998": "So he disguised himself?",
  "43999": "What are you crying about?",
  "44000": "What crime, then, have my eyes committed, if their glance but follows my desire?",
  "44001": "Can a man so important and necessary to society be also my husband?",
  "44002": "And where are those treasures which may be sufficient for your undertakings?",
  "44003": "I ask you if you know any other living man who would make such a statement?",
  "44004": "See?",
  "44005": "Where did you get him?",
  "44006": "Your part of the country, I think?",
  "44007": "Was it a beast or was it a man?",
  "44008": "So you think that it may go on well?",
  "44009": "The pleasant lady?",
  "44010": "How far is it?",
  "44011": "I suppose you're not strong enough to bring the raft to this side, are you?",

  "44014": "Are they gone too?",
  "44015": "You're not going to tell me you've been occupying your leisure in writing poetry?",
  "44016": "Really conscientious?",
  "44017": "You have a room in which you can keep it for me till this evening?",
  "44018": "What are you going to say?",
  "44019": "Somehow she felt hopeful, for was it not possible that her husband also might say these same things to her even yet?",
  "44020": "Was all this serious?",
  "44021": "Tommy?",
  "44022": "What obliges the holder of provisions, the storekeeper of society, to pretend that there is a scarcity, sound the alarm, and provoke a rise of prices?",
  "44023": "For why did he lose all his dignity with me?",
  "44024": "What shall we say to explain them?",
  "44025": "Is it for the royal child?",
  "44026": "What have you made of your slippers, you foolish man?",
  "44027": "Can one picture it?",
  "44028": "Old?",
  "44029": "Do you think differently?",
  "44030": "By me?",
  "44031": "Well, have you seen everything?",
  "44032": "Was it really only an idea, or was it the interpretation of a profound yearning?",
  "44033": "How should he close again?",
  "44034": "What prince?",
  "44035": "Is that, sir, a lawful impediment?",
  "44036": "Is this man your servant?",
  "44037": "The things I make up about that damned ship that you call a galley?",
  "44038": "Who does not love liberty and equality?",
  "44039": "Porthos, what is that yonder?",
  "44040": "Who managed to get on the front seat for the sake of fresh air?",
  "44041": "Tiutkin, coiffeur?",
  "44042": "Ah, how can I express it?",
  "44043": "Does he arrive at a clear conclusion?",
  "44044": "Why not ten years hence?",
  "44045": "Is the infant that stretches out its hands toward a bright object conscious of a desire to possess it?",
  "44046": "How did the star get into the icon?",
  "44047": "But who knows whether I shall have time?",
  "44048": "Why then shall we spend the public money in such employment?",
  "44049": "What sort of an army do you rely on?",
  "44050": "Who knows?",
  "44051": "And what is the end?",
  "44052": "Ayrton here?",
  "44053": "How do you suppose it got there?",
  "44054": "But we'll be still, shall we?",
  "44055": "What's the use worrying right now?",
  "44056": "Can a chap catch a likeness flying along a rail road?",
  "44057": "But is this a satisfactory method to treat a grave matter of faith, coming down to us from the olden times?",
  "44058": "Kekcaa?",

  "44060": "You know that he is of good family?",
  "44061": "Beg your pardon, miss?",
  "44062": "He is then two hours in advance?",
  "44063": "There is a drive, then?",
  "44064": "What, a'ready?",
  "44065": "Would you like to have some?",
  "44066": "What are the possible political implications of this capability and what would this power mean for conducting coalition war and for how our allies react and respond?",
  "44067": "And where the devil have you come from, sir?",
  "44068": "Then I was right?",
  "44069": "But the trunks?",
  "44070": "What ails you, my dearest father?",
  "44071": "So you admire this kind of beauty, do you?",
  "44072": "What shall it be?",
  "44073": "Know you again?",
  "44074": "Would you kindly explain for whose benefit you intend them?",
  "44075": "And when the world was ended, what was there to show for it?",
  "44076": "Shall I send word to him as coming from you?",
  "44077": "And where the leader who shall shout and stir their hearts to fight?",
  "44078": "Why should he stay?",
  "44079": "Do you hear me?",
  "44080": "Does that suit you?",
  "44081": "What utensil?",
  "44082": "And what was the truth of the matter?",
  "44083": "The prison inspector?",
  "44084": "Charley, what are they doing?",
  "44085": "What made you think I'd like it?",
  "44086": "Would ther' be any sense in that?",
  "44087": "They'll never let your linen go, will they?",
  "44088": "But why are you making all this fuss?",
  "44089": "Well, what happened then?",
  "44090": "They never withdrew the offensive troops, and forced us to maintain an equal number of men there since that date, at who can tell what cost to this country, and for what good end?",
  "44091": "But, it may be asked, did all this happen in exactly the same way in which it is told here?",
  "44092": "How can I retrace today the strange steps of my obsession?",
  "44093": "Of whom does my friend speak?",
  "44094": "Of what use, then, is the communication you have made?",
  "44095": "When shall we look upon his like again?",
  "44096": "How is he to know the action of a poison?",
  "44097": "Had they not all, by some hook or crook, done better for themselves than he had done?",
  "44098": "Do not you yourself notice my countrified ways?",

  "44106": "Herbert, can you ask me?",
  "44107": "Why had I not followed him and closed with him in mortal strife?",
  "44108": "Lily, whenever I come here you say that you are glad to see me?",
  "44109": "Attack?",
  "44110": "But what did she ask?",
  "44111": "Shall she repeat it?",
  "44112": "Is it shut?",
  "44113": "Are YOU off now, father?",
  "44114": "Have you passed a good night?",
  "44115": "Fits in with what?",
  "44116": "It is by another original instinct, that we recognize the authority of kings and senates, and mark all the boundaries of their jurisdiction?",
  "44117": "Why do you talk foolishly?",
  "44118": "What on earth is the matter?",
  "44119": "Do you remember it?",
  "44120": "Mistress what?",

  "44143": "And why were you alone?",
  "44144": "Do you make nothing of this?",
  "44145": "In what branch?",
  "44146": "Well, have you seen them?",
  "44147": "Are you going there for some particular reason, or only as a way of getting into her society, and that of her friends?",
  "44148": "And did not the very futility of his own endeavours hitherto prove that it was the former fate that hung over him?",
  "44149": "And where does he now exist?",

  "44160": "And are they good?",
  "44161": "Can any man be courageous who has the fear of death in him?",
  "44162": "What are you stopping for?",
  "44163": "Leave you?",
  "44164": "And think you that we should find him at this hour at his post?",
  "44165": "Could it be that he was growing old?",
  "44166": "Would you like to hear it for yourself?",
  "44167": "Did you give them their tickets?",
  "44168": "Why not, after confessing, borrow money from him?",

  "44218": "The point is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a lady?",
  "44219": "I suppose I may let it slip down?",
  "44220": "Tertius did not find fault with me, then?",
  "44221": "Do you know where it is?",
  "44222": "But what has been the result of this great political spoliation?",
  "44223": "A few greenhorns perhaps?",

  "44305": "Do you mean that you are jealous of a female person?",
  "44306": "What is left for me to do after him?",
  "44307": "And where, I ask, shall we find a nobler opportunity than this, to show what we have learnt?",
  "44308": "But what do we mean by impossible?",
  "44309": "Of course one can do a great deal of good by helping to preserve them, but does not that work interfere with your real calling?",

  "44387": "Does, then, anything seem more natural than egoism?",
  "44388": "Attending him?",
  "44389": "Where was he going?",
  "44390": "And, of course, you want some one who can write that?",

  "45335": "Why are you so very shy, and so very sombre?",
  "45336": "What other initiative, what greater authority, do you ask?",
  "45337": "Why do you serve in this capacity?",

  "45352": "Does that mean that all men have a right to all property?",
  "45353": "And can bear to have my morsel of bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my cup?",
  "45354": "One thing and another commit?",
  "45355": "Can you tell me, this last time, that you feel quite, quite sure, no new affections of mine, and no new duties of mine, will ever interpose between us?",
  "45356": "You remember all this quite clearly, but how is it that your reason calmly accepted all the manifest absurdities and impossibilities that crowded into your dream?",
  "45357": "What troops are these that seem to be passing through the wood?",
  "45358": "You'd never think it to look at me, would you?",
  "45359": "What shall I sing?",
  "45360": "Is there no gentleman or lady of virtue in this neighbourhood, to whom I may fly, only till l can find a way to get to my poor father and mother?",
  "45361": "What object could they have?",
  "45362": "And do you suppose she understands nothing?",
  "45363": "Could I have caused that girl's death and procreated this being?",
  "45364": "What do the women find so impressive in that little brat?",
  "45365": "Well, sir?",
  "45366": "And I must cross it with silver, I suppose?",

  "45385": "Now, children, which is it to be?",
  "45386": "Is the doctrine warranted by FACTS?",
  "45387": "Then what will you do with me then?",
  "45388": "Can anyone grasp what such an offer meant at such a spot, made to a man who, to tell the truth, is very fond of a smoke after meals?",

  "45399": "Just as she was, in a manner, pretending to listen?",
  "45400": "Two words?",
  "45401": "It was he who told you to invite me to appear with these studs?",
  "45402": "And how were they treated?",
  "45403": "Do you bring me a message from the king, or have you made a bold hit, and wish me to take you again under my protection?",
  "45404": "How many times have we seen it?",
  "45405": "Well, then, what possessed you to go down there this time of night?",
  "45406": "And do you know who is his lieutenant?",
  "45407": "I suppose that's what your humanity would suggest?",
  "45408": "And are you going away, then, really?",
  "45409": "Do you not know that you have been dead this long time?",
  "45410": "How long a delay do you wish for?",

  "45417": "But what about women?",
  "45418": "Besides, how could one land on the opposite bank among willows which would scuttle the boat, and with a flood of unknown extent?",
  "45419": "Have I, indeed, said anything you should answer with such a cruel remark?",
  "45420": "What hinders it?",
  "45421": "Now, if some are discernible by the naked eye, and others are detected in such varying sizes that some can only just be distinguished by the most powerful lens, is it not rational to conclude that the smallest discernible to human intelligence is but the medium of a countless race?",
  "45422": "Would you care fer any one that took all those?",
  "45423": "So what have you done with it?",
  "45424": "You mean when a woman has children?",
  "45425": "What is there to surprise anyone in that?",
  "45426": "If I only had it here, wretch that I am, what more should we want?",
  "45427": "Well, monseigneur?",
  "45428": "Do you wish me to begin admiring the peoples?",
  "45429": "Do I not myself know that I am at this moment in want of a dozen pages, and that I am sick with cudgelling my brains to find them?",

  "45490": "Under what obligation do I lie of making such an abuse of time?",
  "45491": "Could any other man express what they knew so well how to express in tones and in words?",
  "45492": "But what book is that next it?",
  "45493": "It surely cannot be you who made shoes for me at the l'ecole militaire?",
  "45494": "How must I do?",
  "45495": "But how, sir, said I, did you part?",
  "45496": "Where was the first lion?",

  "45560": "What are you thinking of doing?",
  "45561": "How could we live and where could we live?",
  "45562": "Is it so nice as all that?",

  "45649": "What was that noise?",
  "45650": "What made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here?",
  "45651": "An old hag who said her son had the plague?",
  "45652": "How then was it closed?",
  "45653": "But, if from their birth men and women are placed in a torrid zone, with the meridian sun of pleasure darting directly upon them, how can they sufficiently brace their minds to discharge the duties of life, or even to relish the affections that carry them out of themselves?",

  "45661": "That your own bunk over on that side?",
  "45662": "Is this a fact?",
  "45663": "But where, where was this self, this innermost part, this ultimate part?",
  "45664": "What have I to consider?",
  "45665": "Had she succeeded in extracting the secret, and awakening in that adamant heart a last faint touch of pity?",
  "45666": "And will you transfer me to your brother?",
  "45667": "Indeed formerly you were wont to give us some freely, and will you not now let us have any for our money?",
  "45668": "How did it come about, I wonder, that the elder officers are not here to interfere with anything you do?",
  "45669": "Natasha, what is it about?",
  "45670": "I may turn my back on this town a few hours sooner than I intended, but what of that?",
  "45671": "How are they?",
  "45672": "Divide it by three, and what is the result?",
  "45673": "Would I speak to you if he did?",

  "45685": "Why, what are these doing, who are bent down so much?",
  "45686": "Five pounds?",
  "45687": "But why do you wish to bind yourself?",
  "45688": "Say, is it possible?",
  "45689": "You've bought our inn?",
  "45690": "If he were not only to sink from his highest resolve, but to sink into the hideous fettering of domestic hate?",
  "45691": "Must one not surrender his right when he is unable to recover it?",
  "45692": "Why are you so careful, so tender, of this one wrong and no other?",
  "45693": "How am I to pay them?",
  "45694": "You hear that?",
  "45695": "I hope you will not object to my remaining at home, sir?",

  "45706": "Of how many does it consist?",
  "45707": "How could they learn, how calculate, in the midst of this night?",
  "45708": "What satisfaction could a woman of delicacy promise herself in a union with such a man, when the very artlessness of her affection might appear insipid?",
  "45709": "Are not the two sexes made for one another?",
  "45710": "Are these bears here?",
  "45711": "No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of mine?",
  "45712": "When will he come?",

  "45785": "How can she know how much we think of our darling?",
  "45786": "There was an advertisement of yours in the papers this morning?",
  "45787": "A being?",
  "45788": "Will you not come and choose your own beasts tomorrow?",

  "47907": "But when I have no more money left to pay you?",
  "47908": "Who knows but that he may alter his mind?",
  "47909": "And since I've took to general reading, you've took to general writing, eh, sir?",

  "47953": "Was not this business well carried?",
  "47954": "Well, have you spoken about my affairs?",
  "47955": "And if that scoundrel had had the audacity to come and take a cottage at the castle gates, why not the audacity to invade the castle itself?",
  "47956": "Is he quiet when he has these fits?",
  "47957": "I shame you?",
  "47958": "Every petty tradesman is to begin to pity her now, is he?",

  "47972": "Now, then, what had I better do?",
  "47973": "Must we not rather assign to death some corresponding process of generation?",
  "47974": "And who is it she takes after?",
  "47975": "Do they?",
  "47976": "What would be said if we were asked to be satisfied with a division of the epochs of the world into the earlier centuries and those following them?",
  "47977": "And what is it to be?",
  "47978": "Harry, my boy, how did you come on in that sum, today?",
  "47979": "Well, would you like to know what occasioned that waterspout?",
  "47980": "She's married to whom?",
  "47981": "What's the use of worrying?",
  "47982": "Well, says I, what the dogs has become of my horse and port mantle?",

  "47984": "Where is it, then?",
  "47985": "In such cases the problem for mythology is, having got two distinct personifications of the same object, what to do with them?",

  "47989": "Now what is there in that nonsense to make a man restless?",
  "47990": "What are ye?",
  "47991": "Can you make a honourahle lady of her?",
  "47992": "Why sign?",
  "47993": "Now, there are times when everybody knows how to ride a horse, are there not, doctor?",
  "47994": "Any use asking where that is?",
  "47995": "It belongs to me, does it not, as it is my arm?",
  "47996": "You think he certainly did steal the money?",

  "49132": "But you did not?",
  "49133": "If her daughter is as true to herself as she should be from what I have seen, what harm ensues?",
  "49134": "Is there anything wrong, sir?",
  "49135": "Do you think there are not women who, as it is their trade and they get their bread by it, value themselves upon their being as careful of children as their own mothers can be, and understand it rather better?",

  "49158": "Saddled?",
  "49159": "Who lives here?",
  "49160": "And what interest have they in all this?",
  "49161": "Who made him a villain?",
  "49162": "Why does he reserve his greatest liberality for the most monstrous errors?",
  "49163": "What does it matter where one lives?",
  "49164": "Will he be at home at eight o'clock this evening?",
  "49165": "If they lied in one genealogy, why are we to believe them in the other?",
  "49166": "Whom shall he reproach?",
  "49167": "But had he the authority to enforce such an order?",
  "49168": "Would you allow me to get it filled for you?",

  "49183": "Could he, for once take for himself the comfort of speaking of his trouble to a man he could completely trust, and yet avoid the danger of betraying her identity to one who knew her so intimately?",
  "49184": "And why was the philosopher more easily satisfied than the mechanic?",
  "49185": "Well, what's that to me?",
  "49186": "Was not the danger imaginary?",
  "49187": "Do you suppose she would like me better for sacrificing you?",

  "49282": "What did you see?",
  "49283": "I understand you to be now consulting me professionally as to your interests?",
  "49284": "And the duke, I suppose, has the key?",
  "49285": "Do you mean that I'm a freak?",
  "49286": "But how do you look upon the fate, sir, which awaits you?",
  "49287": "But what is useful expenditure?",
  "49288": "And that her grandmother's cat may now have no one to polish its teeth?",
  "49289": "Will they let it stop at that?",
  "49290": "What have I betrayed?",
  "49291": "What is he good for?",
  "49292": "You wish it to be kept secret?",
  "49293": "Was not this other lady a pleasant person?",

  "49307": "What were these villains after but money?",
  "49308": "And pretty?",
  "49309": "How came you here at all?",
  "49310": "Still in the wine trade?",
  "49311": "What is the good of reading, what is the good of learning anything, for just six months?",
  "49312": "What has become of her, then?",
  "49313": "And you say you can penetrate it?",
  "49314": "If he wants it, where is his nobility?",
  "49315": "And you understand heraldry?",
  "49316": "Where are grace, beauty, and blandishments, like those?",
  "49317": "Wellington?",
  "49318": "You asked, what has driven me to flight at last?",
  "49319": "Did you get blown up?",
  "49320": "Is it against you or against myself?",
  "49321": "When will it take place?",
  "49322": "Will you permit me to be absent for three days?",
  "49323": "What's it all about?",
  "49324": "Surely these tombstones are not all wrong?",
  "49325": "May you tell me whither?",
  "49326": "Oh, is this the boy?",
  "49327": "Ow'm I to know that?",
  "49328": "How many did we crush under the wall?",
  "49329": "When have you ever spoken like that before?",
  "49330": "But you said I might go, father?",
  "49331": "Now what you going to do?",
  "49332": "Would he not come next morning, if he could?",
  "49333": "What does that say?",
  "49334": "How goes it?",
  "49335": "And the florid face?",
  "49336": "And you will not compromise yourself?",
  "49337": "Why it that?",
  "49338": "Ought they to smoke like that?",
  "49339": "Matter?",
  "49340": "Had she seen him again?",
  "49341": "What ails him?",
  "49342": "How did my soul rise again out of those sepulchres?",
  "49343": "And what have you been doing since yesterday?",
  "49344": "Should we go on?",
  "49345": "Did you imply that he has children of his own, sir?",
  "49346": "Do you by chance happen to think of establishing a telegraph?",
  "49347": "What right have we to make these charges?",
  "49348": "And how's this for high?",
  "49349": "How did she murder?",
  "49350": "Are we ready?",
  "49351": "Whose is this little boy?",
  "49352": "You engaged all these men yourself?",

  "49354": "And if the husband is kind and straightforward, why should not love last?",
  "49355": "Charge?",
  "49356": "Well, then, these tracks upon the grass, were they coming or going?",
  "49357": "Through this window?",
  "49358": "What iss happened?",
  "49359": "Have I done anything to vex you, grandmother?",
  "49360": "And you only married him on that account?",
  "49361": "All set?",
  "49362": "Do you swear that to me?",
  "49363": "Should the aim of punishment be the reformation of the criminal?",
  "49364": "And will these save our lives?",
  "49365": "Is that question in the interests of science too?",
  "49366": "Eh, my pretty?",
  "49367": "Is not this true?",
  "49368": "But what has happened?",
  "49369": "What at our hands demand ye?",
  "49370": "What could either do, that I cannot?",
  "49371": "What therefore do you pretend to?",

  "49375": "Then, why not come away with me?",
  "49376": "Where did he live?",
  "49377": "Or is this pretty artifice contrived, to signify that here the chase must end, and my pursuit be crowned, for you can fly no further?",
  "49378": "Why has so violent a movement been followed by so long a repose?",
  "49379": "A lover?",
  "49380": "Has he not also another object, which is that they may be impoverished by payment of taxes, and thus compelled to devote themselves to their daily wants and therefore less likely to conspire against him?",
  "49381": "What's wrang?",
  "49382": "Can they have finished ploughing?",
  "49383": "Is there any one forgotten thing afore we parts?",
  "49384": "But surely one can do that sometimes?",
  "49385": "Sylvestre?",
  "49386": "And why should your majesty suspect me of dissimulation, I ask?",
  "49387": "Has something special happened?",
  "49388": "Why not try and please us this time?",
  "49389": "How could you behave so unfairly by your sister?",

  "49394": "Speaking with this love of your own then, have you undertaken to convey to me that you believe your husband and your father's wife to be in act and in fact lovers of each other?",
  "49395": "Would you like to inhale it for a second?",
  "49396": "Is he not prorsus inutilis ad thorum?",
  "49397": "Do you mean that there is no such maker or creator, or that in one sense there might be a maker of all these things but in another not?",
  "49398": "Well, little girl, what is it?",
  "49399": "Do not you feel a certain vibration of the soil?",
  "49400": "What is that machine?",
  "49401": "Had he reached the point where he could no longer recognize the reef, could no longer divine the snare, no longer discern the crumbling brink of abysses?",
  "49402": "Are you quite sure?",
  "49403": "You were going to say?",
  "49404": "Where did these things take place?",
  "49405": "What did you say?",
  "49406": "And what would he say to the dragon's cousin the serjeant, if the serjeant should be brought upon the field before he was able to escape from it?",
  "49407": "How do you know where to go to?",
  "49408": "To you and myself?",
  "49409": "Now what does this mean?",
  "49410": "What does it matter to you now, in any case?",
  "49411": "Our father?",
  "49412": "Children, who'd like to race the horses with me?",
  "49413": "Never mind, never mind, what does it matter?",
  "49414": "What o'clock was this?",
  "49415": "And would you just throw in a nod when I seem to ask you for it?",
  "49416": "What was he to say?",
  "49417": "And what is your success?",
  "49418": "That's a most puzzling expression for a natural science man, do you understand?",
  "49419": "Was he not made?",
  "49420": "Would an exchange of name be an exchange of rights?",
  "49421": "And have we, any on us, yet come so low as he come?",
  "49422": "At the same place?",
  "49423": "Have you no longer any kind feeling for your father?",
  "49424": "Out, even to me?",

  "49427": "Did you receive my little note the day before yesterday?",
  "49428": "What sort of a report would they bring of the result?",
  "49429": "And what are you jawing for like that?",
  "49430": "What did you see?",
  "49431": "Going to see the pictures?",
  "49432": "But who should be the executioner?",
  "49433": "And what was that working?",
  "49434": "What are you going to do about him?",
  "49435": "You are not worse, are you?",
  "49436": "Why not go right down now and fix him?",
  "49437": "You may have recognized the fumes?",
  "49438": "Oh, what does that matter?",
  "49439": "From whom did you get this?",
  "49440": "Who do you reckon 't is?",
  "49441": "Why did he not break it there, since it is evident that every yard that he carried it increased the risk of someone meeting him?",
  "49442": "Which I took hold of and was merrily asking him what he would take to have it said for my honour that it was of my getting?",
  "49443": "How did it come to be cut like that?",
  "49444": "On the hypothesis of the essential goodness of man, how then is to be explained the monstrous attempt to change the authority of some into nobility and the obedience of others into plebeianism?",
  "49445": "Why do you trample upon dead bodies in this temple?",

  "49455": "Do you not reckon me?",
  "49456": "MATERIALS?",
  "49457": "Will any antiquarian inform us, if possible, why these bones were placed here?",
  "49458": "And what do you call these, my darling?",
  "49459": "As to you, monseigneur?",
  "49460": "And had he any right to ask her for a revelation of feelings which she had evidently intended to withhold from him?",
  "49461": "Which of the three is it?",
  "49462": "What do I say?",
  "49463": "And you heard what he said?",
  "49464": "Will you give them to me?",
  "49465": "Well, and what have you been doing?",
  "49466": "Why are there no daffodils now?",
  "49467": "Is it not a happy feeling?",
  "49468": "Why sacrifice forty?",
  "49469": "Where's that ten cents?",
  "49470": "And if he left off dreaming about you, where do you suppose you'd be?",
  "49471": "With your brother?",
  "49472": "Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy?",
  "49473": "Now, dear, what are your own?",
  "49474": "I suffer from emotion?",
  "49475": "What laws are there for us?",
  "49476": "And shall she have the head she covets?",
  "49477": "Would she go out to work again?",
  "49478": "Where did I disappear to?",
  "49479": "And you have no way to get news of them?",
  "49480": "Again the law?",
  "49481": "Aunt, will you have some beef?",
  "49482": "Saw her?",
  "49483": "Shall we get out and try to find the road?",
  "49484": "You found something compromising?",
  "49485": "Do you see this letter?",
  "49486": "The gentleman who receives us?",
  "49487": "Has my father asked you for money?",
  "49488": "Who are you, that you should question the judgment of the nations and the ages?",
  "49489": "What would they do in that case?",
  "49490": "You have not counted me out as equal to so much land, and calculated on me as a balance at your banker's?",
  "49491": "Do you know what this plant is?",
  "49492": "Was he awake, or was it but a dream?",
  "49493": "I wonder where we can go next?",
  "49494": "Are you thinking, if I'm drunk itself, I'd leave my daughter living single with a little frisky rascal is the like of you?",
  "49495": "And what awaits you if you remain faithful to your oath, and obey the commands given you?",
  "49496": "Sire, have you in the army one regiment on which you can implicitly rely?",
  "49497": "Will it take long?",
  "49498": "What's that pump stopping for?",
  "49499": "But then, why do you repulse me?",
  "49500": "Are you willing?",
  "49501": "Have I any?",
  "49502": "I wish you'd lend me half a sovereign, will you?",
  "49503": "No, really?",
  "49504": "Has he left you for another?",
  "49505": "Can we really affect the adversary's will?",
  "49506": "Shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the sea?",
  "49507": "Would you say that these, or any similar impertinences which private individuals are supposed to address to their rulers, whether in verse or prose, are well or ill spoken?",
  "49508": "Was it possible for her to forgive him?",
  "49509": "How did late continuators, familiar with the serpents, lions, bulls' heads, crabs, doves, and so forth, on the contemporary shields, keep such picturesque and attractive details out of their new rhapsodies?",
  "49510": "D'you like all that frilly, bunchy stuff at the throat?",
  "49511": "What purpose do they serve?",
  "49512": "Oh is it?",
  "49513": "Were all those dear, sorrowful, valiant, charming or tragic beings merely dreams?",
  "49514": "Is there anything of the feminine gender among them?",
  "49515": "Lodging?",
  "49516": "Not his brother?",
  "49517": "And which of them made this passage?",
  "49518": "Not more?",
  "49519": "Has he been examined by any synod or council?",
  "49520": "Have you any objection to see him in my presence?",
  "49521": "But what about them at home?",
  "49522": "What is the difference between light and the lustre which is seen on the polished surface of opaque bodies?",
  "49523": "Now, ma'am, am I a fool?",
  "49524": "You know who that is?",
  "49525": "Had she left no friends, no relations behind her?",
  "49526": "What are you doing?",
  "49527": "You'll take me as I am, with nothing?",
  "49528": "Things are all right with you then?",
  "49529": "Ought he to turn to the left or to the right?",
  "49530": "Who dares?",
  "49531": "But how did you manage it, little pa?",
  "49532": "Some what?",
  "49533": "Do you give it to me?",
  "49534": "Tell me, are you human, or are you more than human?",
  "49535": "And you have not made her speak?",
  "49536": "Took hold of you?",
  "49537": "Have you not talked long enough to drink?",
  "49538": "How can you be so cruel to me?",
  "49539": "Are you better?",
  "49540": "Who is it that you have fallen in love with, my poor fellow?",
  "49541": "Come, come, who did you think we were when you ran away from us?",
  "49542": "But what do you require of me, then?",
  "49543": "Do you like roses?",
  "49544": "Not just yet?",
  "49545": "Was there ever a loser content with the loss of the game?",
  "49546": "Going?",
  "49547": "What's the colour of their stockings?",
  "49548": "Why do you look at us like that?",
  "49549": "Does his daughter know of the relapse?",
  "49550": "Is it not a pity that people who are bright and clever should so often be exceedingly improper?",
  "49551": "What did it all mean?",
  "49552": "Would you like a little mash?",
  "49553": "And what salary do you ask?",
  "49554": "I s'pose you'll be starting off for college in a fortnight's time?",
  "49555": "But, can they be expected to inspire independent sentiments, whose conduct must be regulated by the cautious prudence that is ever on the watch for preferment?",
  "49556": "Did you see a young lad passing this way in the early morning or the fall of night?",
  "49557": "How can you say so?",
  "49558": "Could inertia of race, on such a scale, be broken up, or take new form?",
  "49559": "And how did he treat you?",
  "49560": "You, dear mamma?",
  "49561": "What line shall you take, then?",
  "49562": "Towards a new sun?",
  "49563": "May I come in, guardian?",
  "49564": "Has he finished his turn?",
  "49565": "Mahotin?",
  "49566": "Yet why did he come?",
  "49567": "Is it as bad as all that?",
  "49568": "How old are you and what's your name?",
  "49569": "Are the others coming out?",
  "49570": "Are you certain that you can afford to part with so much money, and that it is right that it should be so expended?",
  "49571": "Was that last night?",
  "49572": "Is my pa in, do you know?",
  "49573": "Is that all?",
  "49574": "Was this ever possible?",
  "49575": "Their hair?",
  "49576": "Did they leave these two industries to themselves?",
  "49577": "Do they by attaching to the soul and inhering in her at last bring her to death, and so separate her from the body ?",
  "49578": "Have you been slightly dazzled at the sudden fusion of my ingots?",
  "49579": "Perhaps you did not like it?",
  "49580": "Did he look in this way?",
  "49581": "To me?",
  "49582": "But, look here, are you a great hand with the ladies?",
  "49583": "Have you?",
  "49584": "Was he a man or only a crosseyed thief an a loafer?",
  "49585": "Is that all the story?",
  "49586": "None of it at all?",
  "49587": "And how do you find home, now you have come back to it?",
  "49588": "Do you suppose you could find any good in a child by whipping him?",
  "49589": "Is it the secret instinct of decaying nature, or the soul's impulsive throb, as immortality draws on?",
  "49590": "Who was the youth he had adopted and who bore so striking a resemblance to him?",
  "49591": "And his offence?",
  "49592": "Are you sure you are not making a mistake?",
  "49593": "You mean your papers?",
  "49594": "It is a poor conclusion, is it not?",
  "49595": "It may also be called temperate, and for the same reasons?",
  "49596": "But surely this is somewhat irrelevant?",
  "49597": "Was it very vile to be dragged back here again?",
  "49598": "Can you break an engagement off slowly?",
  "49599": "Do you wish to ruin us outright?",
  "49600": "Any how does she do?",
  "49601": "Neckett's children?",
  "49602": "Safe?",
  "49603": "My friends, why do I wish for peace?",
  "49604": "Can he speak?",
  "49605": "And why not with you?",
  "49606": "Well, do you like it?",
  "49607": "What was she to do?",
  "49608": "But can you make any sense out of them?",
  "49609": "He was not playing, then?",
  "49610": "Rosamond a sufferer, a labourer, a female apostle?",
  "49611": "Who could grant them?",
  "49612": "What were you saying about being married?",
  "49613": "Was he engaged in a struggle with some animal whose retreat he had disturbed?",
  "49614": "But certain, if execution be remiss or blindfold now, and in this particular, what will it be hereafter and in other books?",
  "49615": "Did he sign, too?",
  "49616": "You're not angry with me any more?",
  "49617": "How long will this fuse burn?",
  "49618": "Why do you hesitate?",
  "49619": "How can I ever describe the charm and picturesqueness of that summer life?",
  "49620": "May I write to you?",
  "49621": "This will be your luggage, I suppose?",
  "49622": "How could that bring you?",
  "49623": "But all our praises why should lords engross?",
  "49624": "And what then would you say?",
  "49625": "What is your opinion on the matter?",
  "49626": "Pictures are like wine, and want age, you think?",
  "49627": "Where is the entrance?",
  "49628": "The barricade?",
  "49629": "What is life at all?",
  "49630": "If you please, sir, should I have no brandy nor nothing to give the poor creetur?",
  "49631": "Is he kind to her?",
  "49632": "Who is conducting the prosecution?",
  "49633": "Is it mingled with anger or hate?",
  "49634": "What had he to do, indeed?",
  "49635": "Why, what, madam, does it signify what I think?",
  "49636": "Will it be believed that the night of so brilliant a day was for me a night of anguish and perplexity?",
  "49637": "Is not this an agreeable surprise?",
  "49638": "What can you not understand?",
  "49639": "Yes, but where?",
  "49640": "What did you burn 'em for?",
  "49641": "But you, messieurs, you whom I think it an honor to call my friends, since you have been willing to accept that title, what will become of you in the meantime?",
  "49642": "But what does that signify?",
  "49643": "Has it indeed?",
  "49644": "What do you want, sir?",
  "49645": "How did that help you?",
  "49646": "Let me hear it?",
  "49647": "But then again, what has the whale to say?",
  "49648": "What power?",
  "49649": "Surely he has some opinion?",
  "49650": "Will it be soon?",
  "49651": "Must I, then?",
  "49652": "Do you call that nourishment?",
  "49653": "What WERE these things?",
  "49654": "Polo?",
  "49655": "Does he like the moor?",
  "49656": "What, dares the villain write in such base terms?",
  "49657": "But what can I do?",
  "49658": "You are quite sure?",
  "49659": "Publish what, you unreasonable man?",
  "49660": "And where do you come from?",
  "49661": "What letter do you mean she returned unopened?",
  "49662": "Why should I not stay here?",
  "49663": "Has any modern state as yet succeeded in incorporating in its civil constitution such provisions as will ensure to all classes of its subjects any considerable share in the common good?",
  "49664": "You insist?",
  "49665": "What's the motive?",
  "49666": "Could he not hinder that, by persuading her out of her system of privation?",
  "49667": "Well, mon cher, what are you doing personally?",
  "49668": "Do you propose to me to do so, D'Artagnan?",
  "49669": "What did he know of himself?",
  "49670": "What is the young lady's name?",
  "49671": "Shall I adventure?",
  "49672": "Is that his child?",
  "49673": "Then, sire?",
  "49674": "Object to in them?",
  "49675": "Have you any thing further?",
  "49676": "Why, what do they want with more?",
  "49677": "You would wish a notary to be sent for then?",
  "49678": "Is HE her uncle?",
  "49679": "And is it really so beautiful as they say?",
  "49680": "Do you not see?",
  "49681": "Look?",
  "49682": "Do you understand, officer?",
  "49683": "From your husband?",
  "49684": "And who are you to teach me?",
  "49685": "You went home?",
  "49686": "Is not that stonework?",
  "49687": "You order me to receive his friends, too, I suppose?",
  "49688": "Have you any?",
  "49689": "Why should I stay here alone?",
  "49690": "Is my lord pleased with his escort?",
  "49691": "Who will lead us through the land?",
  "49692": "Is it a holiday?",
  "49693": "But where did he find it?",
  "49694": "Then I am not like him, am I?",
  "49695": "Have I a friend here?",
  "49696": "On an omnibus?",
  "49697": "And for what reason?",
  "49698": "And in our opinion the guardians ought to have both these qualities?",
  "49699": "What have they done to my hair?",
  "49700": "Have you ever slept, my friend, in a grove of orange trees in flower?",
  "49701": "But for air to breathe on the road?",
  "49702": "Is not some idea expressed in the act of exhuming the bones after the flesh is decayed ?",
  "49703": "Can I wipe my face now?",
  "49704": "In a game of tennis?",
  "49705": "With what will you save it?",
  "49706": "Cousin, what's the matter?",
  "49707": "May we talk?",
  "49708": "Will you be improved?",
  "49709": "Are you rich, that you may pay for courtiers?",
  "49710": "And has not her own avarice been sufficiently punished by the ruin of her own hopes and the loss of the property by which she set so much store?",
  "49711": "Why do you not go back?",
  "49712": "But tell me all about it?",
  "49713": "And why do you mean to do such a horrible thing?",
  "49714": "What do YOU think of what the prince has just been saying?",
  "49715": "What need you fear?",
  "49716": "You say you fear nothing but death?",
  "49717": "Who would believe, that a childish fault should be productive of such melancholy consequences?",
  "49718": "And my sisters?",
  "49719": "Could the diplomat hold it?",
  "49720": "Would you, therefore, that your physician heal the bodily evil?",
  "49721": "Will you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine wanderer?",
  "49722": "Had something gone wrong with the bank?",
  "49723": "Suppose, for instance, that he should be imprisoned for two months, should he be allowed to return to his living at the expiration of that term?",
  "49724": "What was this universe?",
  "49725": "What million?",
  "49726": "Will you then, in the presence of these two friends, accept me as your future husband, and plight me your vow of truth and love?",
  "49727": "Why are we to love prejudices, merely because they are prejudices?",
  "49728": "D'you remember what you said to me the other day?",
  "49729": "And did he take it?",
  "49730": "Did you ever see a crocodile overcome?",
  "49731": "Did you see the nursing home!?",
  "49732": "My friend deceive me?",
  "49733": "Well, my dear, what is it?",
  "49734": "Would you fear to go, perhaps to your death, for this imperilled man?",
  "49735": "Must I go?",
  "49736": "Why speak, when words cannot express what one feels?",
  "49737": "Who is to prevent me?",
  "49738": "Of what was he in pursuit?",
  "49739": "Can you not recognize something undisturbed and peaceful among disturbance and trouble?",
  "49740": "And you, my lord?",
  "49741": "What was behind their competent stare?",
  "49742": "And how did this despatch reach you?",
  "49743": "But how were they to be got at?",
  "49744": "What should I speak to him for?",
  "49745": "Tabooed?",
  "49746": "Not?",
  "49747": "Nor running a chance of arrest?",
  "49748": "Who said I wanted to?",
  "49749": "Impossible?",
  "49750": "But wherefore do I awake this remembrance?",
  "49751": "But why are you going?",
  "49752": "To the left?",
  "49753": "How can it be that he should think otherwise?",
  "49754": "What drives him to it?",
  "49755": "How in the name of reason can I be asked to eat a mutton chop?",
  "49756": "Who knows whether these opacities will not become transparent?",
  "49757": "Eh, what?",
  "49758": "What on earth are you raving about?",
  "49759": "What is it but the worst and last form of intellectualism, this love of yours for passion and the animal instincts?",
  "49760": "But what do you mean?",
  "49761": "With this conviction, would he have left the head apothecary in that town?",
  "49762": "Theatres, evening parties, dinners in town?",
  "49763": "What atonement shall we offer him?",
  "49764": "Does HE suppose that people will pay him only to come and sit with them and go away again?",
  "49765": "What have you got?",
  "49766": "Are you coming up there now?",
  "49767": "Have you seen 'em lately?",
  "49768": "How should this same new wisdom be started up and established?",
  "49769": "What are you, and what may your business in this house be?",
  "49770": "Do these belong to the cardinal?",
  "49771": "So that's angel number one?",
  "49772": "Then it's all right?",
  "49773": "Who are you, my lad?",
  "49774": "Baisemeaux?",
  "49775": "What month did we meet him?",
  "49776": "How about the cross?",
  "49777": "In these circumstances what was more natural than that some should advocate a return to the classics and all that the classics enshrined?",
  "49778": "What did they call the wretched being?",
  "49779": "Did he not make speeches in the lobby to show how villainous that decision was, and how it ought to be overthrown?",
  "49780": "When do you go back again?",
  "49781": "What say they?",
  "49782": "Say summat?",
  "49783": "But what is there in common between these rude outlines of instinctive organization and the true social science?",
  "49784": "I wish to soothe him, yet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of every hope of consolation, to live?",
  "49785": "Slight, what moved you to be thus impertinent?",
  "49786": "Or from the fact that I have escaped, that I have completely fled, that I am finally free again and am standing like a child under the sky?",
  "49787": "What does he wish you to do?",
  "49788": "How shall I ever thank you?",
  "49789": "Could she be happy with this jungle waif?",
  "49790": "Had he, in lending to this stranger the aid of his key, and in making some other man than himself emerge from that portal, the pure and disinterested intention of rescuing an assassin?",
  "49791": "You must wait for what?",
  "49792": "Then she is dead?",
  "49793": "But when are you free?",
  "49794": "How could such a collection be here, where you see everything except the inside of one little cupboard and a few boxes?",
  "49795": "What's your business in this apartment?",
  "49796": "Who can calculate the depth of affection expressed in that enthusiastic SO?",
  "49797": "Their eyes?",
  "49798": "Was not that everything?",
  "49799": "Dirty?",
  "49800": "Raissa, dear, what's the matter with you?",
  "49801": "What consequence is that to me?",
  "49802": "Is she your mistress?",
  "49803": "Do you know what?",
  "49804": "How would you prevent it?",
  "49805": "But where are the body o 'em?",
  "49806": "What's up?",
  "49807": "And what shall I say to her?",
  "49808": "Why did you not tell him that when he was living?",
  "49809": "Must there not have been a custodian of the shrine?",
  "49810": "Eh?",
  "49811": "And after they have arrived at years of discretion by the care of their parents, are the inconveniencies attending their separation more certain than their foresight of these inconveniencies and their care of avoiding them by a close union and confederacy?",
  "49812": "This gentleman?",
  "49813": "Might I hope to be saved?",
  "49814": "You'll be no more jealous?",
  "49815": "Do you behold the beauty and the wisdom here?",
  "49816": "What is it that these have done?",
  "49817": "Was he a politician?",
  "49818": "Darnay?",
  "49819": "But are they the same as fire and snow?",
  "49820": "Why do you bring your prolifigate companions here?",
  "49821": "What'll sting him?",
  "49822": "Who is giving the reception?",
  "49823": "Have we ceased to be men?",
  "49824": "And did he not help you to rise to his own level, so that you, little by little, became his assistant in all his undertakings?",
  "49825": "What music?",
  "49826": "D'you mean to say that if you really believed you could move mountains you could?",
  "49827": "On what?",
  "49828": "Do you follow?",
  "49829": "How could I part with him?",
  "49830": "How do you suppose a man is to live?",
  "49831": "Were you present during the last struggle?",
  "49832": "Suppose I told you the janitor picked it up on the steps almost under the big snowball?",
  "49833": "Well, have I ever been slow in coming?",
  "49834": "Call yourself a religious woman?",
  "49835": "How can one be condescending to a lady to whom one owes a matter of forty pounds, and who is perpetually throwing out hints for the money?",

  "49838": "And what now?",
  "49839": "Would it be possible for empty stomachs to resist such an invitation?",
  "49840": "Well, what can you expect?",
  "49841": "And what time of day does the lady receive?",
  "49842": "What do you want to ask me?",
  "49843": "Are you out of your senses?",
  "49844": "But will you have this?",
  "49845": "Is it not adherence to the old and tried, against a new and untried?",
  "49846": "Is that irresistible power, which for fifty years has shaken the government and agitated the people, to be stifled and subdued by pretending that it is an exceedingly simple thing, and we ought not to talk about it?",
  "49847": "From what place and people have you come?",
  "49848": "Will you step this way?",
  "49849": "Then one soul not being more or less absolutely a soul than another, is not more or less harmonized?",
  "49850": "And did you run after them?",
  "49851": "There's no doubt it was chloral?",
  "49852": "If he pulls me away when I talk to you, what will he do to your wife?",
  "49853": "But do you answer for them?",
  "49854": "Have you a pain or what's up with you?",
  "49855": "To what end doth she quaver with her lips, like a monkey in the dismembering of a lobster?",
  "49856": "Akim?",
  "49857": "How was it that a man so exact and fastidious could have made this error of a day?",
  "49858": "How could you suffer such a snare to be laid for him?",
  "49859": "Say, is it then so sad a thing to die?",
  "49860": "Would you think it?",
  "49861": "Not above a mile, I reckon?",
  "49862": "Was it falling?",

  "49866": "How can you talk so?",
  "49867": "May I come nearer now?",
  "49868": "What do you see so terrific in that, dear marquise?",
  "49869": "Gerald himself, who was responsible for all this industry, was he a good director?",
  "49870": "But what could you do in a case like that?",
  "49871": "You hint at something not honourable, then?",
  "49872": "You really mean to marry her?",
  "49873": "And what again is that about which we have no fear?",
  "49874": "What are you going to do to me for telling them this time?",
  "49875": "Are you sure of what you say?",
  "49876": "Shall I come and see you there?",
  "49877": "Could it be he had failed to note the loud warning?",
  "49878": "What more do they want?",
  "49879": "Anything fresh?",
  "49880": "But what could he have done?",
  "49881": "We shall have to ask, how did small round bucklers come to be unknown to late poets who saw them constantly?",
  "49882": "Is it going to be on the tariff?",
  "49883": "And now by mine?",
  "49884": "Farming?",
  "49885": "Surely I've put it plainly enough?",
  "49886": "What's the matter with you, young man?",
  "49887": "They are, perhaps, in truth, a little disposed to be smugglers, but what harm is in that?",
  "49888": "The man whom they are every day telling me to take such care of?",

  "49914": "Now, what mortal imagination could conceive it?",
  "49915": "Madame will await my return?",
  "49916": "And he has not married yet?",
  "49917": "Do you suppose I ever forgot you?",
  "49918": "Is your honor sure?",
  "49919": "Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?",

  "49925": "You have not turned saving, at this time of day, I hope?",
  "49926": "Did you really hear it yourself?",
  "49927": "Does no one cry here, either?",
  "49928": "And do you not imagine, he said, that if there were a competition in evil, the worst would be found to be very few?",

  "49930": "What on earth were they to do with him?",
  "49931": "Well, dear?",
  "49932": "Is there to be no sale after all?",
  "49933": "And where the deuce did you pick him up?",
  "49934": "But the diamond I gave you yesterday?",
  "49935": "That were heretics?",
  "49936": "That does not seem a very likely start, does it?",
  "49937": "And you would have kept your word, monseigneur?",
  "49938": "But, what can I do for them, here?",
  "49939": "Mamma, from whom was that letter which you got this morning?",
  "49940": "Do not say that you look for none?",
  "49941": "A proof?",
  "49942": "Have you got that cross you bought from the soldier with you?",
  "49943": "Speak to her now?",
  "49944": "And was not its mouth like a parrot's beak?",
  "49945": "But the DUNCAN is a pleasure yacht, is it not?",
  "49946": "What do you think she used to do?",
  "49947": "Where is the ink, I wonder?",
  "49948": "Do these women think?",
  "49949": "Where is the road to the south?",
  "49950": "What do you say, sir?",
  "49951": "Will it last long?",
  "49952": "Did you ever mention to any one that it was your intention to give any one the treaty to be copied?",

  "49964": "What hurt have you got?",
  "49965": "Was ever man so beset as I?",
  "49966": "Any time, sir?",
  "49967": "This?",
  "49968": "Why should you thus harass yourself?",
  "49969": "How shall I ever again believe in human goodness?",
  "49970": "What on earth have you been up to, man?",
  "49971": "What was I doing yesterday at this hour?",
  "49972": "Is he a millionaire?",
  "49973": "Is it for us to see?",
  "49974": "And who is it she has tried to marry?",
  "49975": "She has no daughter of her own, has she?",
  "49976": "When can I reckon on receiving information from you?",
  "49977": "And the young man?",
  "49978": "You've only believed me contented then because you've believed me stupid?",
  "49979": "Whatever's that?",
  "49980": "So you're on to him, too?",
  "49981": "Did she love him?",
  "49982": "Then what am I?",

  "49988": "Why did you?",
  "49989": "Did she show courage?",
  "49990": "Not have it?",
  "49991": "Do you know of any?",
  "49992": "How can you be so unjust?",

  "49996": "How long have you held your position in that college?",
  "49997": "I wonder if he could have followed after us, and got lost?",
  "49998": "And your two other friends?",
  "49999": "Since when has malady banished medicine?",
  "50000": "What can we hope for at the hands of such as those?",
  "50001": "Sure, what is a kiss from the finest of women but a pleasant thing, like a long putt sunk, or the first salmon of the year caught like a trout, or the ball through the goal before the whistle blows?",
  "50002": "Is there no reality in the penitence thus sealed and witnessed by good works?",
  "50003": "Seditious to wish to be governed by good heads or leaders?",
  "50004": "Are her disappointment and sorrow of no interest to you?",
  "50005": "You are ready to sacrifice the world for love?",

  "50007": "With grief and trouble, my dear friend?",
  "50008": "Is it the simple or the compound, the unchanging or the changing, the invisible idea or the visible object of sense?",
  "50009": "And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie?",
  "50010": "What peevish luck have I, I cannot meet with these bragging rascals?",
  "50011": "What disagreeable people?",
  "50012": "You come from the provinces?",
  "50013": "What DO such men as he want?",
  "50014": "Meanwhile, I dare say you would like to arrange your toilette a little?",

  "50036": "What wonderful thing is that?",
  "50037": "What can have become of her, then?",
  "50038": "Why do you think so?",
  "50039": "Why do you bother yourself about such an idle question?",

  "50041": "What day?",
  "50042": "Do you know who the devil is?",
  "50043": "Shall I tell you my theory?",
  "50044": "Damn it, but none of us have a barge for property, have we?",
  "50045": "Were you surprised, my asking you to take me out and give me a bit of dinner tonight?",
  "50046": "And are those enemies too?",
  "50047": "Am I pretty?",
  "50048": "Do you mean him harm, sir?",
  "50049": "What person?",
  "50050": "And what do you want with your flag of truce?",
  "50051": "And what do you say of him who is hated by all the people of his neighborhood?",
  "50052": "Surely not?",
  "50053": "Surely not third class?",
  "50054": "Is that another letter in your hand?",
  "50055": "Is it possible that foreign nations can either respect or confide in such a government?",
  "50056": "In what proportion?",
  "50057": "Are there many more of you to come?",
  "50058": "Has the soul offspring?",

  "50061": "Are we to doubt this statement too, merely because no biographer has hitherto given us any information on the matter?",
  "50062": "But what's the reason?",
  "50063": "Will she come?",
  "50064": "Will that please you, dear?",
  "50065": "Out of sorts?",
  "50066": "I?",
  "50067": "Which are my fingers and which are yours?",
  "50068": "Am I not too late?",
  "50069": "But then would it not be better to do away with them entirely?",
  "50070": "And thoroughly?",
  "50071": "Had they written home to tell his mother and father?",
  "50072": "Sing, sir?",
  "50073": "Then, shall the man who is too weak to work be refused a right to the ownership of a coat?",
  "50074": "Are you in the police yourself?",
  "50075": "What hope could they entertain that any portion of the old continent still existed beyond that dreary barrier?",
  "50076": "And what is the name of this village?",
  "50077": "Are you going away, then?",
  "50078": "Was not the secret told me, in the natural recoil of my heart at the first sight of him, and as often as I have seen him since?",
  "50079": "Now, do you want a horse, or will you go afoot?",
  "50080": "Do you not understand?",
  "50081": "Oh, that book, eh?",
  "50082": "Bless you, when you come to talk of a gentleman, who is to define the word?",
  "50083": "You are better?",
  "50084": "Will you shut the door, if you please?",
  "50085": "Why, what had you been doing?",
  "50086": "Waiting for somebody?",
  "50087": "Mazarin's factotum?",
  "50088": "Did he love her in return?",
  "50089": "How many limbs have you passed?",
  "50090": "Now, are you right there?",
  "50091": "No sooner, sir?",
  "50092": "If I have said too much, or more than I meant, what of it?",
  "50093": "When is he in fact to have those full civil rights which have so long been his in law?",
  "50094": "What do you propose?",
  "50095": "Is it true that you want to marry her?",
  "50096": "That's to say, you think there's a lack of something in me?",
  "50097": "Is it consistent with the proper dignity and the manly character of a nation?",
  "50098": "When did it come?",
  "50099": "Well, and do you think that those who say so are wrong?",
  "50100": "Come now, which of the two shall speak first?",
  "50101": "Are you so much?",
  "50102": "Have you got any money?",
  "50103": "Like what she used to be, or like what she was in the carriage?",
  "50104": "Does it, in dealing with other nations, civilized or backward, propose what is palpably to its own advantage, or is it evidently disinterested?",
  "50105": "Why have you not sent to me?",
  "50106": "And now you are going?",
  "50107": "Who else knew where it was?",
  "50108": "What does he mean by that?",
  "50109": "How shall he meet that dreadful day?",
  "50110": "Did you hear anything?",
  "50111": "A dog or a baby, eh?",
  "50112": "Would you have me indeed, annihilate the memory of the bond between us?",
  "50113": "Does not the timocratical man change into the oligarchical on this wise?",
  "50114": "Where's your warrant?",
  "50115": "Did he give you this?",
  "50116": "What do you say of making an exchange?",
  "50117": "Is she happy?",
  "50118": "How do you mean here?",
  "50119": "Shall I tell you of what it reminded me?",
  "50120": "Why did his cold eye glisten, and his heart leap up as they went past?",
  "50121": "Burned it?",
  "50122": "You have nothing to regret?",
  "50123": "And who would not have so believed, hearing him so speak at the point of death?",
  "50124": "Why, then, have they lost in laboring for you what you have gained in not laboring for them?",
  "50125": "Do you remember?",

  "50137": "Sharks, I suppose?",
  "50138": "What brings you here?",
  "50139": "Will you live with us?",
  "50140": "All the same, how much might you be disposed to offer me for this beautiful young horse of mine?",
  "50141": "You have your chronometer?",
  "50142": "May I speak to your mistresses?",
  "50143": "You want me to throw again, do you not?",
  "50144": "Was it not enough?",
  "50145": "Did you hear what I asked you, or not?",
  "50146": "What is the destination marked on your ticket?",
  "50147": "You believe in the moon then, affecting the weather?",
  "50148": "And there was no one in it but the two of you alone?",
  "50149": "With all this, sir, said I, can you think I shall be at a loss to pass my time?",
  "50150": "Have you ever tried sulphate of copper in water?",
  "50151": "You do not suffer?",
  "50152": "To be ordained, I think you said?",
  "50153": "What about him?",
  "50154": "Would you think you were well off, if there were not one creature in the world near you to love you?",
  "50155": "What ignorance of pain?",
  "50156": "A hunter?",
  "50157": "But what harm had poor I done?",
  "50158": "What's the consequence?",
  "50159": "Had you any friends?",
  "50160": "I surveyed him some time, and not being able to recollect his face, demanded, with a faltering accent, what his business was with me?",
  "50161": "Do you mean it's cut out of a single crystal?",
  "50162": "But would his men obey orders?",
  "50163": "In view of our moral, social, and political responsibilities, can we do this?",
  "50164": "Would a man, think you, give YOU up if you were poor?",
  "50165": "What good are we doing with all this ado?",
  "50166": "Heigh ha?",
  "50167": "Or did it come through the post?",
  "50168": "Where are your passports?",
  "50169": "Why show me this, if I am past all hope?",
  "50170": "What have you been doing to this boy of mine, hey?",
  "50171": "But what is to be done now?",
  "50172": "Is solidarity becoming closer, or competition diminishing?",
  "50173": "Shall I go with you?",
  "50174": "What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?",
  "50175": "At this rate, man, how can you ever expect to marry?",
  "50176": "And you will try and save yourself by swimming?",
  "50177": "What sort of a man is he?",
  "50178": "In the port?",
  "50179": "And who showed you up into this room?",
  "50180": "How many are there?",
  "50181": "What are we to do about it all?",
  "50182": "I foppish?",
  "50183": "Perhaps you have one like it here?",
  "50184": "Will you begin?",
  "50185": "What good are they?",
  "50186": "Why is it that at a bachelor's establishment the servants invariably drink the champagne?",

  "50268": "Did she return home?",
  "50269": "She's been talking, has she?",
  "50270": "Did he die in the hospital?",
  "50271": "You do?",
  "50272": "Or does she exert a choice, and prefer certain males?",
  "50273": "And you did not awaken me?",
  "50274": "What took place between these two beings?",
  "50275": "You supposed that I was alone?",
  "50276": "What do you wish to say about it?",
  "50277": "How can I now thrum the tunes, sith I have lost my hand?",
  "50278": "You'll see her yourself?",
  "50279": "What has effected this revolution?",
  "50280": "Granton?",
  "50281": "Also they are utterly unjust, if we were right in our notion of justice?",
  "50282": "What IS the fun?",
  "50283": "What's demoralized you?",
  "50284": "Aire?",
  "50285": "Waiter, who's been helping himself to my whiskey?",
  "50286": "And what is my father like?",
  "50287": "And yet what is the feeling of lovers when they recognize a lyre, or a garment, or anything else which the beloved has been in the habit of using?",
  "50288": "As if one were frighted?",
  "50289": "Is there any one here who has stout loins and heart?",
  "50290": "Is it doubted, then, that the plan I propose, if adopted, would shorten the war, and thus lessen its expenditure of money and of blood?",
  "50291": "How dare you cast eyes on him when I had forbidden it?",
  "50292": "Would it not be expedient that he should take the lady at her word and escape?",
  "50293": "The poor lieutenant?",
  "50294": "What will mother and father live on now?",
  "50295": "Did you lose each other in the confusion?",
  "50296": "Look him up?",
  "50297": "What do the circumstances of life matter if your dreams make you lord paramount of time and space?",
  "50298": "You'll take a morsel of something?",
  "50299": "What shall I talk about?",
  "50300": "Is it not right to resign ourselves entirely, whatever may be denied us?",
  "50301": "Because you've made up your mind?",
  "50302": "What does the warrior want with the scalps of women?",
  "50303": "Those that sweeten and those that embitter?",
  "50304": "Can you endure to think of the dismemberment of our country?",
  "50305": "Do you think I am to be imposed upon by that northern accent, which you have assumed?",
  "50306": "I suppose you've heard of me?",
  "50307": "You like my new suit?",
  "50308": "What, then, do you suppose?",
  "50309": "Julie?",
  "50310": "Now you understand me?",
  "50311": "Candy man, have you a sweetheart anywhere with hair as long and soft as that?",
  "50312": "How can she stay in the town where you are?",
  "50313": "Who's sending him back?",
  "50314": "Or, why are so many witnesses summoned, and so many artifices practised, to discover what so easy an experiment would infallibly reveal?",
  "50315": "Can I appoint you my executor?",
  "50316": "How about the horses?",
  "50317": "Do you really know any others who have it?",
  "50318": "How will you give me notice of it?",
  "50319": "And the goldsmith?",
  "50320": "Why, I hope you will not a hawking now, will you?",
  "50321": "You do not intend to be his wife?",
  "50322": "How know you it?",
  "50323": "How had he come to such a pass?",
  "50324": "But why should not I wear pink ribbons?",
  "50325": "For who could have forborne?",
  "50326": "But what do you propose to do?",
  "50327": "How could you so cruel?",
  "50328": "That is to say, you would rather not?",
  "50329": "Could this have any connection with the crime?",
  "50330": "Why am I asked what next shall see the light?",
  "50331": "Why did he feel that it was not unwatchful?",
  "50332": "Where's that other beast?",
  "50333": "What would it cost, sir, if we stopped here?",
  "50334": "Now, where is the romance in all that?",
  "50335": "And the same wages as he had?",
  "50336": "No one will be less likely to commit adultery, or to dishonour his father and mother, or to fall in his religious duties?",
  "50337": "That you think it would be so charming?",
  "50338": "What means it?",
  "50339": "Does it belong to the smaller or to the larger of the two?",
  "50340": "Are we to have nothing tonight?",
  "50341": "Why, my brave horses, why be left behind?",
  "50342": "That their genius should not have in it, even after the lapse of ages, some little of heaven?",
  "50343": "Why, cannot you see that they are all infatuated with pride and vanity?",
  "50344": "Had she not guessed anything, seen anything, comprehended anything?",
  "50345": "And what then, sir?",
  "50346": "That you do not wish to compromise her?",
  "50347": "Which is the best?",
  "50348": "Wherefore, then, should I be dissatisfied?",
  "50349": "How are my father and mother?",
  "50350": "How much had he written away?",
  "50351": "Will your excellency be so good as to mount the shoulders of two of our men, they will carry you ashore?",
  "50352": "You see that pile of pig iron?",
  "50353": "What could he wish or look for that he would not have obtained through my friendship?",
  "50354": "Here, take this,' continued he, after rapidly writing the few lines I brought to your excellency, and upon receipt of which you deigned to receive me into your service, and proudly I ask whether your excellency has ever had cause to repent having done so?",
  "50355": "Are you?",
  "50356": "Can you tell a good many fighting stories?",
  "50357": "What bride?",
  "50358": "Boythorn?",
  "50359": "Will that suit you?",
  "50360": "Where is the boat in which you came, gentlemen?",
  "50361": "What news?",
  "50362": "Is there any city which he might name?",
  "50363": "Will your majesty permit me to express a contrary opinion?",
  "50364": "What little gell's this?",
  "50365": "Who's the stranger?",
  "50366": "Did you hear us?",
  "50367": "Do the dead come back?",
  "50368": "Your wound?",
  "50369": "Why, did you know her, papa?",
  "50370": "Why was that corner chosen to write it on?",
  "50371": "How can one believe a woman after that?",
  "50372": "Why give it as a reason for not coming now?",
  "50373": "Only that?",
  "50374": "What do you think he wants to do?",
  "50375": "What ails us gazing where all seen is hollow?",
  "50376": "And when you want to buy a ship, the shipwright or the pilot would be better?",
  "50377": "How do you know that?",
  "50378": "How could it be possible for us to disobey your commands?",
  "50379": "But in what sense?",
  "50380": "About whom?",
  "50381": "Where, where are you going to?",
  "50382": "Why not you also?",
  "50383": "After her having been what she was?",
  "50384": "It was you, then, who wrote to him?",
  "50385": "What would you have me do?",
  "50386": "How can I dare to form a scheme, when I am aware that the chance of success must be so strong against me?",
  "50387": "Have you gone cracked, my good friend?",
  "50388": "How else can we explain her frenzied anxiety that her second one should not enter it?",
  "50389": "If this be the design of it, who can so properly be the inquisitors for the nation as the representatives of the nation themselves?",
  "50390": "Why spoil those apples?",
  "50391": "If the charge be incapacity, what evidence will support it?",
  "50392": "Do you play then?",
  "50393": "Will he ever return?",
  "50394": "Are there any witnesses?",
  "50395": "If you have to draw a man who is in motion, or lifting or pulling, or carrying a weight equal to his own, in what way must you set on his legs below his body?",
  "50396": "What is life, and what is death?",
  "50397": "What would happen then?",
  "50398": "Was this the banquet he prepar'd for us?",
  "50399": "What then gives us so great a propension to ascribe an identity to these successive perceptions, and to suppose ourselves possest of an invariable and uninterrupted existence through the whole course of our lives?",
  "50400": "If so, what became of them in those dreadful days?",
  "50401": "How can we here?",
  "50402": "Did he understand that he had made a grave mistake?",
  "50403": "Nor courage either?",
  "50404": "Now will you do what I want you to?",
  "50405": "No light repartee, have you, old bean?",
  "50406": "How did you word your inquiries?",
  "50407": "Can we not avoid them by keeping to the shore?",
  "50408": "Is it improper and unsafe to intermix the different powers of government in the same body of men?",
  "50409": "Do you promise to deliver it?",
  "50410": "How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil?",
  "50411": "Who are you?",
  "50412": "What is your name?",
  "50413": "Did you see him then?",
  "50414": "Then I suppose I was to hold my tongue and say nothing?",
  "50415": "How could the fruits follow?",
  "50416": "His name?",
  "50417": "Why the devil have they any stairs with such windows?",
  "50418": "What made you open it?",
  "50419": "You have seen him at work?",
  "50420": "Where else can I ask him?",
  "50421": "But can we not descend?",
  "50422": "Pip, will you tell me something?",
  "50423": "What lunacy is this, that haunts this man?",
  "50424": "Say, how long are you going to stay here?",
  "50425": "How shall I make my music now?",
  "50426": "Can I never act for you, and you for me?",
  "50427": "Do you think it is true?",
  "50428": "How would you like that?",
  "50429": "Why is she so excruciatingly beautiful that I cannot be angry with her, even now?",
  "50430": "That is your affair?",
  "50431": "You know he shot his brother?",
  "50432": "What noise was that?",
  "50433": "What would you give that you could help loving me?",
  "50434": "Do we suppose that principle, whatever it may be in man, which has to do with justice and injustice, to be inferior to the body?",
  "50435": "Yes, what it is?",
  "50436": "Where had he seen those lineaments?",
  "50437": "Of what was I speaking?",
  "50438": "Never in moderation?",
  "50439": "Is the other one stuffed also?",
  "50440": "What best wishes?",
  "50441": "I mean the one with the three naked women?",
  "50442": "Why, who else could I possibly suspect?",
  "50443": "What made you leave me to come here alone?",
  "50444": "Something will turn up?",
  "50445": "Abandon this subject altogether, and again jeer at the monks and ridicule the nuns?",
  "50446": "Have these very matters ever produced any difficulty amongst us?",
  "50447": "Have I not also critics who do not spare me?",
  "50448": "What avails recrimination over matters wholly past recall?",
  "50449": "It die?",
  "50450": "But if he had escaped?",
  "50451": "Who was that insolent fellow?",
  "50452": "What new mystery was this?",
  "50453": "What do I think of it?",
  "50454": "Is not this unavoidable?",
  "50455": "Have you spoken to her?",
  "50456": "But what could it do, if any danger came?",
  "50457": "Could it be for any other reason than that he did not want to see it, and if so was he not a traitor to the cause of truth?",
  "50458": "Why are better results attained under scientific management than under the other types?",
  "50459": "Ah, a weapon?",
  "50460": "Run away?",
  "50461": "What was he, then?",
  "50462": "Matter?",
  "50463": "Not paralysis, I hope?",
  "50464": "Run away?",
  "50465": "What does he say?",
  "50466": "Why is it that the peace of the country is disturbed in order that one people may assume to judge of what another people should do?",
  "50467": "So you think he'll make her an offer today?",
  "50468": "But where is he?",
  "50469": "It was the only letter you had?",
  "50470": "You have no explanation yourself of the tragedy?",
  "50471": "What do you mean by having made a stiff?",
  "50472": "What different armour should I need?",
  "50473": "Should he abandon her?",
  "50474": "Who is with him?",
  "50475": "Can you bear witness that you're no better than a fool?",
  "50476": "What should I do with a translation?",
  "50477": "You did not get my letter?",
  "50478": "By whom was she espied, and how entrapped?",
  "50479": "Is she a very massive person?",
  "50480": "And what is your opinion?",
  "50481": "According to scientific notions of inertia and force, what ought to be the result?",
  "50482": "And your address?",
  "50483": "What sort of husband can he be?",
  "50484": "How do they use to be?",
  "50485": "Why should we?",
  "50486": "What are you doing there, you rascal?",
  "50487": "Convicts?",
  "50488": "Why, then, are you about to betray it to me?",
  "50489": "But even in that case, may he have no object beyond his present station, to which he may sacrifice his independence?",
  "50490": "And powder, and bullets?",
  "50491": "If your husband thinks fit to keep you in the dark over this matter, is it for me, who has only learned the true facts under the pledge of professional secrecy, to tell what he has withheld?",
  "50492": "Have you had one of your bad nights?",
  "50493": "What, my friends, must be the consequences of this agitation?",
  "50494": "Can I do anything for you, gentlemen?",
  "50495": "Is he not a beauty?",
  "50496": "Could he still rise and regain his footing in his conscience upon something solid?",
  "50497": "Is it not indeed great enough, sire?",
  "50498": "Are you ambitious, and do you seek after the greatnesses of the earth?",
  "50499": "When they have no leaves and look gray and brown and dry, how can you tell whether they are dead or alive?",
  "50500": "Would we be able to see those pictures?",
  "50501": "Then if children make so much trouble, why do people have 'em?",
  "50502": "And you never confined your patients?",
  "50503": "How could you be so obstinate?",
  "50504": "Tom, what on earth ails that cat?",
  "50505": "If he had not had his 'profonde' what would he have done?",
  "50506": "What is to be done with her, then?",
  "50507": "Do you know what it is?",
  "50508": "I do something?",
  "50509": "Which way went he, young man?",
  "50510": "Are you coming to this ball?",
  "50511": "Why did he not correct our judgment at the start?",
  "50512": "How can one deceive these dear little birds, when they look at one so sweetly and confidingly?",
  "50513": "What is the matter at home?",
  "50514": "Is there any sense in it?",
  "50515": "And where is he going?",
  "50516": "Well, what have I to do with that?",
  "50517": "Do you not consume supplies as fast as you get them forward?",
  "50518": "But, what am I saying?",
  "50519": "Shall we try argument?",
  "50520": "She is at home?",
  "50521": "Verdurin?",
  "50522": "Then I asked if there were many clerks?",
  "50523": "How can he talk like that?",
  "50524": "But who gave you leave to cease eating mutton?",
  "50525": "And what can one do?",
  "50526": "Yes, that is the doctor we've been sewing for, is it?",
  "50527": "What pamphlet is this?",
  "50528": "Was it not for these causes that you send for me when the great trouble came?",
  "50529": "May I live with you, and tend upon you as I used to do?",
  "50530": "Will you unclasp your hand?",
  "50531": "Do you see this same ram?",
  "50532": "Shall I go and offer her my services?",
  "50533": "And why does the minister keep his hand over his heart?",
  "50534": "Who keeps house here?",
  "50535": "Are they not bubbles?",
  "50536": "How is all with you?",
  "50537": "Tasting?",
  "50538": "What are his qualifications?",
  "50539": "Where did you start from?",
  "50540": "Could anything cause us to swerve to one side?",
  "50541": "And are not both the city and the entire temple now full of the dead bodies of your countrymen?",
  "50542": "You dine and sleep here, of course?",
  "50543": "What else could I look for, being what I am, and leading such a life as mine?",
  "50544": "Where is this poor giant, or this poor wretch of a vanquished knight, to find her?",
  "50545": "It is the first time, then, that you ever went to that house?",
  "50546": "How may we pass that which is impassable?",
  "50547": "In what stables champed these sleek, nervous horses and rested the gorgeous carriages?",
  "50548": "And what am I to tell your father?",
  "50549": "My father is well, is he not?",
  "50550": "Was it going farther from, or nearing, the disc?",
  "50551": "How is this?",
  "50552": "Recollect, my lord, if he did not say something a little like that to you?",
  "50553": "Is he really her cousin, as he says?",
  "50554": "Who's to prevent me?",
  "50555": "Why dig up the pestilence from the pit in which it is buried?",
  "50556": "The other question?",
  "50557": "I may go on?",
  "50558": "And by whom?",
  "50559": "It is true, then?",
  "50560": "Should an ass exceed me in fortitude?",
  "50561": "Would the island hold together till then?",
  "50562": "No, why should you?",
  "50563": "What can I do sir?",
  "50564": "Should I have remained in that house, near you and them, if I did not love them?",
  "50565": "And this letter?",
  "50566": "What d'you charge for a ride, boss?",
  "50567": "What is the matter?",
  "50568": "And if it be so, what is it?",
  "50569": "Mother, what are you crying for?",
  "50570": "Were I to allow you to march out, what security can I have that you will not join them, and afterwards fight against me?",
  "50571": "Reinforcements?",
  "50572": "What would it be right to do?",
  "50573": "What's up with you?",
  "50574": "Should it ever be said that he had robbed those old men, whom he so truly and so tenderly loved in his heart of hearts?",
  "50575": "What made you think he'd ceased to take any interest in the case?",
  "50576": "Is it anything I have done that has pulled you down like that?",
  "50577": "What could my father mean by sending me to be an inmate in this strange family?",
  "50578": "You mean you'll have no quarrel with me?",
  "50579": "Was he awake or was he asleep?",
  "50580": "Well, but if I bought the mill, and allowed your husband to act as my manager in the same way, how then?",
  "50581": "What am I to do if I love him and the other one too?",
  "50582": "And have you come from far like this?",
  "50583": "And what did I tell 'ee?",
  "50584": "Could she, who had been so active in the getting up of the funeral triumph, do less than exult?",
  "50585": "Who now will tell the ladies that I would hie me thither?",
  "50586": "What is genius?",
  "50587": "You have taken care, I hope, of the casket I sent you to lock up?",
  "50588": "What evils?",
  "50589": "And is it wounded?",
  "50590": "What recollections of boyhood and innocence might have been flitting across his brain?",
  "50591": "What noise is that?",
  "50592": "No dignity in whaling?",
  "50593": "Why could they not wait a little?",
  "50594": "No apology, I suppose?",
  "50595": "What are you thinking of?",
  "50596": "How have I offended?",
  "50597": "Why should we be unable to preserve a remembrance of them?",
  "50598": "There is something else you wanted to say?",
  "50599": "Was I not right in saying at the outset that, relatively to the tax, we are behind our institutions?",
  "50600": "What charge, sir?",
  "50601": "Did you see no one?",
  "50602": "Oh, may I get this rose?",
  "50603": "He asked me whether I would go with him?",
  "50604": "Why did you leave him on the road?",
  "50605": "And in such a case what is one to say?",
  "50606": "But as I am not bound to give in to your plans, any more than you are compelled to submit to mine, may I ask to know if you have formed any which depend on my assistance?",
  "50607": "Yes, why?",
  "50608": "To which of us?",
  "50609": "Could we not break it?",
  "50610": "What does he drink?",
  "50611": "But however are you going to race in this mud?",
  "50612": "Is this the part of wise men, engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty?",
  "50613": "Cannot you describe her?",
  "50614": "And that which is not more or less a harmony is not more or less harmonized?",
  "50615": "A joke?",
  "50616": "What is his folly?",
  "50617": "I must, then, remain here?",
  "50618": "Who were they?",
  "50619": "Mercenary, mem?",
  "50620": "Is that worth talking about and making so much ado?",
  "50621": "When are you starting?",
  "50622": "You want no treasures and no castles?",
  "50623": "Now then, gentlemen, shall I break the seal or not?",
  "50624": "It must have been on the boulevard?",
  "50625": "Could a statue of marble have been more impassive and more mute?",
  "50626": "Would you like to?",
  "50627": "Do you call yourself a raw country girl?",
  "50628": "And, then, do you think that my stumps are pretty?",
  "50629": "But do you fail to live?",
  "50630": "Sure it's he?",
  "50631": "Whose fault?",
  "50632": "She has formed no other attachment?",
  "50633": "What matter?",
  "50634": "And wherefore has he not been to see me?",
  "50635": "Shall we really try it?",
  "50636": "Doth any praise himself?",
  "50637": "I tried to decline taking the guinea on the first occasion, but with no better effect than causing her to ask me very angrily, if I expected more?",
  "50638": "Now, then, where's the first boy?",
  "50639": "What has age to do with it?",
  "50640": "What besides?",
  "50641": "Separate, my dear?",
  "50642": "And alone?",
  "50643": "Why should I pull her into it?",
  "50644": "No cheering news, then?",
  "50645": "And with what object?",
  "50646": "Monks would never learn how you knew what you do?",
  "50647": "What do you keep SAYING you will for?",
  "50648": "Was it so?",
  "50649": "But the earl?",
  "50650": "Do you see, now, one reason why I have let you go thus early into the world?",
  "50651": "Will you show me your plan?",
  "50652": "What needs appealing in a fact so plain?",
  "50653": "And if he have great riches, to you leave him all his wealth, or do you make him a beggar?",
  "50654": "Bast?",
  "50655": "What was it you wanted to ask, sir?",

  "51435": "Why did you not wait for me, sir, to escort me downstairs?",
  "51436": "What can you do?",
  "51437": "Would you like to go into my study?",
  "51438": "Have you not taken a bastion?",
  "51439": "You wish to speak to me alone?",
  "51440": "Passepartout?",
  "51441": "Who said that you were to go away?",
  "51442": "And, if he did not assist her, who would do so?",
  "51443": "So you're not afraid of getting fat?",
  "51444": "What regiment is that, and where are you going?",
  "51445": "What science can there be in a matter in which, as in all practical matters, nothing can be defined and everything depends on innumerable conditions, the significance of which is determined at a particular moment which arrives no one knows when?",
  "51446": "Well, and what have you to say to me?",
  "51447": "Did you not?",
  "51448": "Am I taken prisoner or have I taken him prisoner?",
  "51449": "Do you think that a good man and a bad must share the same fate, and alike die, and end?",
  "51450": "Does it matter?",
  "51451": "What do you go for, then?",
  "51452": "How do you feel now, my love?",
  "51453": "What is this, then?",
  "51454": "Did you want him too to go sailing about amid all kinds of hardship while others are eating up his estate?",
  "51455": "You do like it?",
  "51456": "And now you know all that you want to know, do you not?",
  "51457": "How should he dare to seek the bottom of it?",
  "51458": "Will you do me that favour?",
  "51459": "Will power, which has received numerous complaints upon this subject, intervene to restore competition and prevent monopoly?",
  "51460": "Can anybody lend me a shilling?",
  "51461": "In what way did you go thither?",
  "51462": "Well, what do you want me to do?",
  "51463": "You know something about him, do you not, madame?",
  "51464": "Presumed?",
  "51465": "Will not the man of the learned profession, who will feel a neutrality to the rivalships between the different branches of industry, be likely to prove an impartial arbiter between them, ready to promote either, so far as it shall appear to him conducive to the general interests of the society?",
  "51466": "Is it all right?",
  "51467": "Can they go on, my father?",
  "51468": "Shall we go on upstairs?",
  "51469": "Or is this a season to revel in?",
  "51470": "You've j'ined a college by this time, I suppose?",
  "51471": "And exactly the same thing happened to both of you?",
  "51472": "Shall we follow you?",
  "51473": "Why not exclude every man convicted of any degrading legal crime, even petty larceny?",
  "51474": "But advocates and proctors are not one and the same?",
  "51475": "You surely do not mean to let the child dine at eight o'clock?",
  "51476": "Well, what are we to do?",
  "51477": "By whom can he have been instigated?",
  "51478": "What sort of games are you up to?",
  "51479": "Has he taken off his doublet?",
  "51480": "Have you a sumptuous table, a dashing wife, and gold to scatter, in order to attract them to your suite?",
  "51481": "Did I not understand you to say that, as the consequence of the collision, the character of the comet's orbit has been changed?",
  "51482": "Why, too, should he write a letter now, rather than six years ago?",
  "51483": "All ready?",
  "51484": "Might she have loved me?",
  "51485": "What can you do then?",
  "51486": "Your daughter?",
  "51487": "But where is she?",
  "51488": "But can this be possible?",
  "51489": "No, you do not, do you?",
  "51490": "What help do you want from me?",
  "51491": "Tell me at once that I want to assassinate you?",
  "51492": "Is it not those very persons who mourn for him?",
  "51493": "Did you ever know anybody who was born to it besides myself?",
  "51494": "The first?",
  "51495": "Will he continue, then, to keep our secret?",
  "51496": "Have I changed so much?",
  "51497": "All your naughty purposes, I make no doubt, were quite changed?",
  "51498": "Despair?",
  "51499": "What does that mean?",
  "51500": "SHALL I TURN THE SCORPION?",
  "51501": "No letter that can possibly have been overlooked?",
  "51502": "Now, father, may I marry my lass?",
  "51503": "Can I, in a theatre, occupy at the same time one place in the pit, another in the boxes, and a third in the gallery?",
  "51504": "Are we not now in her pursuit?",
  "51505": "You will let me help, will you not?",
  "51506": "How can I expect to convince you, if you cannot tell robbery when I show it to you?",
  "51507": "And number three?",
  "51508": "How could I help it?",
  "51509": "What would the minister have said, mother?",
  "51510": "Do you suppose that I am afraid to die?",
  "51511": "How many all told?",
  "51512": "What letters?",
  "51513": "Will it not be better that she should keep the resentment of the insult for ever?",
  "51514": "What could be the cause of this phenomenon?",
  "51515": "Or whether it eats and drinks?",
  "51516": "But what would you say in it?",
  "51517": "May I go up and speak to her?",
  "51518": "Manager of the company or the house?",
  "51519": "Did he think I'd flinch from his bottle?",
  "51520": "Did they want to cut his chin off?",
  "51521": "But how did my father know that I had gone this road and in this dress?",
  "51522": "Was he her grandfather?",
  "51523": "Let him go free?",
  "51524": "When an apple has ripened and falls, why does it fall?",
  "51525": "Who could it have been?",
  "51526": "Do you wish for any further details?",
  "51527": "How many now are there whom we have known in life?",
  "51528": "And who thus designated it?",
  "51529": "What gives, or can give it, or should give it?",
  "51530": "Was she born so?",
  "51531": "What advice do you offer to society, to the country, in alarm?",
  "51532": "Where are the officers?",
  "51533": "You have found peace?",
  "51534": "Can you believe that I should be so low, so base, as to lose money in that way?",
  "51535": "But what I mean is, where do I come in?",
  "51536": "If you have an officer and he does wrong, do you suffer him to remain in office, or do you set up another in his stead?",
  "51537": "Where, then, does monopoly get this singular virtue, which the etymology of the word and the vulgar aspect of the thing would never lead us to suspect?",
  "51538": "What is your opinion of it?",
  "51539": "Do you understand what that means?",
  "51540": "What are you up to?",
  "51541": "It is only, is it, because we have made no defence, and have led them into a false supposition?",
  "51542": "Are they equals in the same sense in which absolute equality is equal?",
  "51543": "What does he do to prevent further misfortune?",
  "51544": "Well, you know of course that the greater is relative to the less?",
  "51545": "ARE you happy?",
  "51546": "Do I really look the same as usual?",
  "51547": "What is your trade?",
  "51548": "Is he going to pass the night in that fashion?",
  "51549": "But why should we dispute about names when we have realities of such importance to consider?",
  "51550": "What a senseless fellow you are, really?",
  "51551": "A count, and a rich one too, eh?",
  "51552": "Where is she now?",
  "51553": "Shall we terminate our conference for the night?",
  "51554": "Stars have fallen from heaven, and what shall I dare who am but dust?",
  "51555": "What is a moor?",
  "51556": "What sort of hope?",
  "51557": "In how long?",
  "51558": "Twenty, do you say?",
  "51559": "Do they?",
  "51560": "Why did you get him over here, if you hate him so?",
  "51561": "And who may have been the foundress of this sect?",
  "51562": "Would you actually believe that you had committed your foolish acts in order to spare your son from committing them too?",
  "51563": "Is he no more graced amongst them then, say you?",
  "51564": "Why did you not carry them away with your forks and spoons?",
  "51565": "Why did they allow the ordinance to go into effect?",
  "51566": "Have you no letter for him?",
  "51567": "What, do you excuse him?",
  "51568": "What was her reply?",
  "51569": "Is not this indirectly to deny women reason?",
  "51570": "Why should you always be DOING?",
  "51571": "Can it be?",
  "51572": "Who of the five appointed is to write the district address?",
  "51573": "But who can have told you so?",
  "51574": "But why should it?",
  "51575": "Would he obtain air by chemical means, in getting by heat the oxygen contained in chlorate of potash, and in absorbing carbonic acid by caustic potash?",
  "51576": "And you are satisfied?",
  "51577": "What else was there to be done?",
  "51578": "What on earth does she mean by it?",
  "51579": "Who knoweth the mysteries of the will, with its vigor?",
  "51580": "Right behind?",
  "51581": "If they find him?",
  "51582": "What music?",
  "51583": "May I go also, and take for you the bundles?",
  "51584": "Want me?",
  "51585": "Our dearest, truest, kindest friend and protector?",
  "51586": "What in thunder do you fellows mean by clappin' the law on the town when all decent men are at sea this way?",
  "51587": "Who's that singing?",
  "51588": "Are you what is called a happy man?",
  "51589": "Or do you think you have?",
  "51590": "What is all this about?",
  "51591": "What on airth are you drivin at?",
  "51592": "Eh, your excellency?",
  "51593": "Your valise is then empty?",
  "51594": "Afterwards I was horribly frightened and could not help going away, for if the police had found us, what would have happened to us then?",
  "51595": "Where they are playing?",
  "51596": "But what about me?",
  "51597": "Where did they all live?",
  "51598": "But what is the next step?",
  "51599": "May this fairly be called egoistic doctrine?",
  "51600": "And if you had known that I was coming today, why be so irritated about it?",
  "51601": "Did I read it badly?",
  "51602": "Any ladies on your deck?",
  "51603": "Do you disapprove?",
  "51604": "How shall we get home?",
  "51605": "Do you think I'm deaf?",
  "51606": "At the store of one dealer and a duty of but five at another's?",
  "51607": "What are you doing there, you limb?",
  "51608": "Am I called on to find reasons?",
  "51609": "Ye love tragedies and all that breaketh the heart?",
  "51610": "No motives but motives of sheer patriotism?",
  "51611": "Will you enter my service?",
  "51612": "Did you ever see this little trick?",
  "51613": "What do they intend doing?",
  "51614": "Know at least something?",
  "51615": "And what did you think of this fine story, eavesdropper?",
  "51616": "And when do you think we will arrive?",
  "51617": "But has he any enemies?",
  "51618": "What was the good?",
  "51619": "Who will take care of them?",
  "51620": "How much longer would they last?",
  "51621": "Will you give me a good character with my month's notice?",
  "51622": "Free?",
  "51623": "This you?",
  "51624": "But what were they doing in the winter, then?",
  "51625": "Have they annoyed you further?",
  "51626": "Wilson?",
  "51627": "By the way, what use are our damned icebreakers?",
  "51628": "Might it not possibly thus reach the land?",
  "51629": "Can you blood and give a clyster, spread a plaster, and prepare a potion?",
  "51630": "How used your people to spend all the early part of their lives?",
  "51631": "And did you write it yourself?",
  "51632": "Did you know that?",
  "51633": "How are they different and contrary?",
  "51634": "Supposing that a matter were brought confidentially to his knowledge, is it absolutely necessary that he should pass it on to the detectives?",
  "51635": "Would he pay it?",
  "51636": "You've not come here for to make me suppose that he wants to marry HER?",
  "51637": "What has happened to vex you so?",
  "51638": "But who is it that has played us this cool trick?",
  "51639": "What think you I ought to do?",
  "51640": "How can you think of such a thing, in this snow?",
  "51641": "Incomplete?",
  "51642": "Then why has he not indicated the book?",
  "51643": "What, at the worst, for that matter, could she be conceived to have in her head?",
  "51644": "You accept, however?",
  "51645": "Guest's sisters giantesses?",
  "51646": "What ever in the world was that?",
  "51647": "Is the count shooting in the gallery?",
  "51648": "Is it not immediately and intuitively evident that COMPETITION DESTROYS COMPETITION?",
  "51649": "Shall they be permitted to keep back settlers from more or less civilized and densely populated countries?",
  "51650": "How can you be so certain?",
  "51651": "Are you waiting for him for your gentlemen's dinner?",
  "51652": "Baldwin?",
  "51653": "Or is it all but a dream?",
  "51654": "But what do you tell me that for?",
  "51655": "A lover evidently, for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you?",
  "51656": "Does medical jurisprudence provide nothing against these infringements?",
  "51657": "Now tell me who is the strongest of all?",
  "51658": "I wonder if they'll catch the fellow?",
  "51659": "Anything out of the common?",
  "51660": "Is it possible that the truth of life has been revealed to me only to show me that I have spent my life in falsity?",
  "51661": "Whatever you and I might say about it would make no difference, would it?",
  "51662": "Who said that?",
  "51663": "More shameful debts and extravagance?",
  "51664": "But granting that he has plenty of capital, of what use would it be to him if the extent of the land which he cultivates always remained the same?",
  "51665": "Is it so, my dear?",
  "51666": "Do you suppose I am going to take a whole host to help me?",
  "51667": "But I mean how much should you want if we stayed in this house?",
  "51668": "Captain, is this a time to snore, when we are going to be robbed?",
  "51669": "Is there anything in it or no?",
  "51670": "And no advice for me?",
  "51671": "Was that the work of an abolitionist?",
  "51672": "What is it, captain?",
  "51673": "Where does she get such wicked propensities?",
  "51674": "What are you waiting for?",
  "51675": "From whom have you learned of the abduction of your wife?",
  "51676": "And how came you to possess the throne?",
  "51677": "How could my noble brothers have so wrought, that I should be a mere vassal's bride?",
  "51678": "Did he teach you nothing?",
  "51679": "Make them up, I mean, by coming to see YOU?",
  "51680": "And what may that be?",
  "51681": "Where is the other man?",
  "51682": "Mercy on us, what are the children thinking of?",
  "51683": "If you was here, sir, then who rang the bell?",
  "51684": "What about you?",
  "51685": "And did you take milk?",
  "51686": "Does your father come home at six too?",
  "51687": "What tailor ever took payment of him for making his clothes?",
  "51688": "The actress?",
  "51689": "To whom did you apply?",
  "51690": "Where are they?",
  "51691": "And if not?",
  "51692": "What do you call, my dear, the consequences?",
  "51693": "Are you one who can hold your tongue?",
  "51694": "What do you suppose is the end of such women?",
  "51695": "Had we not better allow our hostess to retire?",
  "51696": "Willoughby?",
  "51697": "Would such a gentle animal be guilty of eating a fellow creature?",
  "51698": "What are we to do now, sir?",
  "51699": "And what did you tell him?",
  "51700": "And what does it mean to me, after all?",
  "51701": "D'you s'pose they know?",
  "51702": "Know the way?",
  "51703": "Do not I know how soon it is coming?",
  "51704": "To whom is it addressed?",
  "51705": "What else then would you say?",
  "51706": "And may I ask his name?",
  "51707": "It was the hand of him that loved her best, the hand that of all she would herself have chosen, had it been to her to choose?",
  "51708": "Did he have any money, this boating man?",
  "51709": "How had it originated?",
  "51710": "But since then, when we were dragged out of the route, why did you not speak?",
  "51711": "Could he have written this under the idea that the soul is a harmony of the body?",
  "51712": "Pleasantly?",
  "51713": "May not a rag be forgotten?",
  "51714": "Was it?",
  "51715": "Have you often observed that door open?",
  "51716": "Said I not that I loved you?",
  "51717": "Does he really think so?",
  "51718": "What do you wish, then?",
  "51719": "In a word, should he be the sinister mute of destiny beside these two happy beings?",
  "51720": "Bombay?",
  "51721": "Since you appear to know so many things, can you tell me what is become of that woman?",
  "51722": "He has not done it very badly, has he?",
  "51723": "What could have become of that money?",
  "51724": "That will be your married look, sir, I suppose?",
  "51725": "Are they deastralized?",
  "51726": "Blister we not for bursati?",
  "51727": "What say you to that, my friends?",
  "51728": "But can you sing standing on your head, with a top spinning on your left foot, and a sabre balanced on your right?",
  "51729": "Ah, well, what were you doing there in your room all by yourself?",
  "51730": "And how should it not be hopeless?",
  "51731": "Was there any romance, anything secret or mysterious, about the wedding?",
  "51732": "When will the dean be home?",
  "51733": "And your intelligent sister?",
  "51734": "Are there any houses around here?",
  "51735": "I should have to work, perhaps?",
  "51736": "To cling fast to it, or to let go his hold?",
  "51737": "Why should you crawl abject before the understanding of a flea?",
  "51738": "And will you engage not to do any harm to the sentry, except as a last resort?",
  "51739": "Will you come in and have some supper?",
  "51740": "Et it?",
  "51741": "If I see that a man is in danger of being drowned at a dangerous spot, ought I to let him perish?",
  "51742": "Do you mind my coming to find you?",
  "51743": "How do you know that this passage does not run straight to our destination?",
  "51744": "Do you mind the time you dyed your hair?",
  "51745": "In which?",
  "51746": "Why was this, or why was all mention of any field of duty for the head of the army left out of the army regulations?",
  "51747": "The same password?",
  "51748": "And where is the lady gone?",
  "51749": "You wish to see the general?",
  "51750": "But you, monseigneur?",
  "51751": "And when will they take place?",
  "51752": "Or was it the waking up of a sentiment which had bided its time as patiently as its inspirer?",
  "51753": "Must not whatever CAN run its course of all things, have already run along that lane?",
  "51754": "Who returns to his family?",
  "51755": "What will the future be in these days of advancement?",
  "51756": "Are your friends the birds at their pranks again?",
  "51757": "No legal papers or certificates?",
  "51758": "And in what sort of actions or with a view to what result is the just man most able to do harm to his enemy and good to his friends?",
  "51759": "How far distant?",
  "51760": "Danny, is this so?",
  "51761": "That extremely unwholesome menu you were outlining just now?",
  "51762": "Then it was that man who knocked my hat off?",
  "51763": "You like listening?",
  "51764": "But what is the truth, then, among all these contradictions?",
  "51765": "What are we to do?",
  "51766": "Who may she be that sends for people to see her that distance?",
  "51767": "You begin to comprehend me, do you?",
  "51768": "How should we feel?",
  "51769": "What, then, would you wish to be done?",
  "51770": "Shall I fall to your hand as a victim of crafty and cautious shikar?",
  "51771": "By her ignorance?",
  "51772": "And how is it he tells us they can exclude it?",
  "51773": "What is it we want to know?",
  "51774": "Can you see?",
  "51775": "With mind intent?",
  "51776": "How should you ask such a question?",
  "51777": "Why stand you mute?",
  "51778": "Are we too late?",
  "51779": "To whom?",
  "51780": "Have I not told you a dozen times that I have enough for twenty men, and that half of what I have is yours?",
  "51781": "What becomes of old giants?",
  "51782": "Where's your commonsense?",
  "51783": "And have you abandoned the service?",
  "51784": "Who is come to establish himself here?",
  "51785": "Are you certain of that?",
  "51786": "Was he on a journey of discovery?",
  "51787": "Any ill news?",
  "51788": "Was he now there?",
  "51789": "But who does not see that this purely theoretical distinction between capital, product, and income falls so far as the treasury is concerned, and that the same impossibilities which we have pointed out reappear here with all their fatal character?",
  "51790": "And could not such words from her whom I fondly prized before every other gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my heart?",
  "51791": "How are we to effect this?",
  "51792": "But what was the good?",
  "51793": "And, besides, where would you go?",
  "51794": "What shall we do, then?",
  "51795": "Now in vessels which are in a state of mutiny and by sailors who are mutineers, how will the true pilot be regarded?",
  "51796": "Is this the way to the stockyards?",
  "51797": "Moan?",
  "51798": "Why, what is it?",
  "51799": "Are they at home?",
  "51800": "Does he never go out?",
  "51801": "Are you sure that he is dead?",
  "51802": "You are setting up an establishment, of course?",
  "51803": "But you do, in earnest, lady?",
  "51804": "What does that ditty mean?",
  "51805": "You will come?",
  "51806": "Surely share and share alike between the three?",
  "51807": "What were you doing, then?",
  "51808": "Can you show us the place?",
  "51809": "And you are going away tomorrow?",
  "51810": "The ridiculous prints, eh, which are in, circulation, have given you a false idea of my personal appearance?",
  "51811": "What day?",
  "51812": "Where, even indirectly, does he give pernicious advice?",
  "51813": "What have you to sell?",
  "51814": "Why did I not experience a moment of embarrassment, timidity or restraint?",
  "51815": "Why, then, does he say no more?",
  "51816": "Who are those?",
  "51817": "Was that all he said?",

  "53772": "Well, I suppose you've been back in the woods laying in a supply of switches for tomorrow?",
  "53773": "What do you want to turn on me like that for?",
  "53774": "But where am I to sit?",
  "53775": "But does it not show great weakness?",
  "53776": "Where must we place him?",

  "53787": "Is it still only an intention, your eminence?",
  "53788": "Have you brought forth children as she has done?",
  "53789": "Was it too abrupt a transition from the habits of the twelve preceding years?",
  "53790": "How could they have done that?",
  "53791": "Is there one of your fathers or mothers or friends who does not see through them?",
  "53792": "But the motive for this meeting?",
  "53793": "Do you not see how very suggestive that is?",
  "53794": "See you not the scar of the awl?",
  "53795": "What's kep us poor?",
  "53796": "Do we not know that man is frail and fickle, that his heart is full of delusions, and that his lips are a distillery of falsehood?",
  "53797": "Why were all these acts?",
  "53798": "How the devil can you dream of fawning on me?",
  "53799": "Which part should I keep back?",

  "53829": "You did not notice it, then, since you say you have been told so?",
  "53830": "Now do you think I shall ever feel that for a woman?",
  "53831": "Was it not, your majesty?",
  "53832": "If I were to go to the shore some night with you do you think I could see your rock people too?",
  "53833": "Is it a large school, aunt?",
  "53834": "And how does he now regard the matter?",
  "53835": "I am not I?",
  "53836": "What's he about, I wonder?",
  "53837": "What's in here?",
  "53838": "Why are you in hopes?",
  "53839": "How has this been done, monsieur?",
  "53840": "Who but I?",

  "53844": "And how could it be otherwise?",
  "53845": "You never were in it?",
  "53846": "How explain that?",
  "53847": "But have we changed as a nation even in our time?",
  "53848": "Said she, is the creature begging me off from insult?",
  "53849": "Were any other lives lost?",
  "53850": "Why should I work hard when that lazy fellow gets the same pay that I do and does only half as much work?",
  "53851": "To penal servitude?",
  "53852": "If, on the contrary, there is wealth which is not the product of labor, why is the possession of it a privilege?",
  "53853": "What is there to hinder?",
  "53854": "HOW was he going to come to her?",

  "53856": "What brings you up to town?",
  "53857": "Why must I live?",
  "53858": "How can I do that?",
  "53859": "Is that why you called him a humbug, just now?",
  "53860": "Who could resist his power?",
  "53861": "What then is that about which we ought to employ our serious pains?",
  "53862": "But we are quite friendly?",
  "53863": "You give me your word of honor not to go?",
  "53864": "Me too?",
  "53865": "Where are your verses?",
  "53866": "Have I disgraced myself in any way?",
  "53867": "Yes, said she, and mine too, I suppose, sir?",
  "53868": "Is he dead?",
  "53869": "You are a foreigner, are you not?",
  "53870": "Was it ever there?",
  "53871": "What impression have I made upon your fancy?",
  "53872": "Are you arrested for much, sir?",
  "53873": "You have got some building of your own I dare say, now?",
  "53874": "For whom alone ought we to fear?",
  "53875": "Do you think anything else was to be expected of them?",
  "53876": "How does it become me, well?",
  "53877": "What would you do with them?",
  "53878": "But what interest have you in recommending her to such a step?",
  "53879": "In health?",
  "53880": "Who knows what babies will turn to?",
  "53881": "Where on earth do you see anything?",
  "53882": "That is your religion?",
  "53883": "Might it be, in the mysterious ways of spiritual life, that her soul at those same moments had been conscious of his homage?",
  "53884": "Will you promise not to shoot till we've done?",
  "53885": "What's the next step?",
  "53886": "What are you up to?",
  "53887": "Will you stop your noise?",
  "53888": "Where did you get it?",
  "53889": "Friends?",
  "53890": "Could you start at once?",
  "53891": "I ruined?",
  "53892": "Might it bite him fatally?",
  "53893": "What's the matter with you this evening, dear?",
  "53894": "Can I be of any service?",
  "53895": "Where in that place in the country, by the way?",
  "53896": "Does she really think of adopting teaching as a profession?",

  "53901": "Whom had she gone forth to meet?",
  "53902": "Will you go inside first and join the suitors, leaving me here behind you, or will you wait here and let me go in first?",

  "53910": "Do you not read them?",
  "53911": "To which of the gulfs did he nod his head?",
  "53912": "But where's the harm, if he likes it?",
  "53913": "You've been to see her?",
  "53914": "Is it not enough that the high duties have been paid as long as the money arising from them could be applied to the common benefit in the extinguishment of the public debt?",
  "53915": "You know what it is, then?",
  "53916": "What is the use of a statue if it cannot keep the rain off?",
  "53917": "Where is the road now, and its merry incidents of life?",
  "53918": "When am I to see her?",
  "53919": "But who says you are driven away, or that you are exiled?",
  "53920": "Shall we resort to entreaty and humble supplication?",
  "53921": "Or in his voice?",
  "53922": "What's the meaning of it all?",
  "53923": "And what is the meaning of the two lines which almost immediately follow?",
  "53924": "Would they pass near enough to be able to solve certain physical and geological questions until then insoluble?",
  "53925": "Could she?",
  "53926": "What are we, you ask, and what our life?",
  "53927": "Why, in that instant, did I not extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly bestowed?",
  "53928": "Did you enjoy your lunch?",
  "53929": "Of the other king's?",
  "53930": "Anna, is this you?",
  "53931": "And where would that lead her?",
  "53932": "Shall I ever be as happy as here with ye?",
  "53933": "And have you fixed your habitation in this distant land?",
  "53934": "And will you swear it?",
  "53935": "How could she refuse him just because he was about thirty pounds overweight?",
  "53936": "Who did you say it was?",
  "53937": "And could we go farther than to the moon if we wanted to?",
  "53938": "Ferdishenko has gone, you say?",
  "53939": "How's your discussion society getting on?",
  "53940": "Are you apprehensive of the new sphere you are about to enter?",
  "53941": "Well, are you satisfied?",
  "53942": "Are you going to him?",
  "53943": "Is it rational?",
  "53944": "Who did that?",
  "53945": "Have you REALLY?",
  "53946": "Can you repair this wheel immediately?",
  "53947": "Because it has a particular quality which no other has?",
  "53948": "Come where?",
  "53949": "Hitched to a cabriolet?",
  "53950": "Do they believe that at each supposed act of creation one individual or many were produced?",

  "53953": "And the government is the ruling power in each state?",
  "53954": "Are you always in the country?",
  "53955": "And we are going to wait too?",

  "53961": "But you said you had no commission from her?",
  "53962": "Would you like me to send her there?",
  "53963": "And is it that liquid that is going to blow up our rocks?",
  "53964": "Do you take?",
  "53965": "And what is the difficulty now?",
  "53966": "By the way what about the political rights of these folk under your schemes?",
  "53967": "And what do you intend to do?",
  "53968": "So the rascal ran off, eh?",
  "53969": "Where is the foundling's father hidden?",
  "53970": "Talk?",
  "53971": "How are you getting along?",
  "53972": "But if so, why do you degrade yourself to serve this dirty foreigner, when you at least saw the last of a genuine national gentry?",
  "53973": "Did no one hear him move?",
  "53974": "Do you hear me, sir?",
  "53975": "What are you plotting against me?",
  "53976": "Are we surprised that a multitude of proselytes should embrace the doctrine and the passions of an eloquent fanatic?",
  "53977": "Now, did you ever hear the like since you were born?",
  "53978": "What court?",
  "53979": "But what can be done about it?",
  "53980": "Has not the experience of centuries confirmed his opinion?",
  "53981": "And now that you understand the situation, what do you advise me to do?",
  "53982": "What is sadder than a dead house, with its skeleton standing bare and sinister?",
  "53983": "Besides, what trouble is there at all in doing this?",
  "53984": "Is it a job, or a boy at marbles?",
  "53985": "You found it?",
  "53986": "There are tints in the clouds this evening, violets and blues, which are very beautiful, are they not, my friend?",
  "53987": "To lie 'for' her?",
  "53988": "But such being the case, why should she take on herself to cater for the amusement of people of such degraded tastes?",
  "53989": "You remember the place, my father?",
  "53990": "Who has?",
  "53991": "A fish of the sea or river?",
  "53992": "Was the island still inhabited by the castaway to whose succor they had come?",
  "53993": "Well, sir?",
  "53994": "Why, what is the meaning of such desperate passions?",
  "53995": "Ah, why indeed?",
  "53996": "There are so many paths leading to heaven, who knows which is the right one?",
  "53997": "Can human nature be constructed on lines so insignificant?",
  "53998": "And after all, what harm does it do?",
  "53999": "Troop?",
  "54000": "Why should she answer any such question?",
  "54001": "And is the reason known?",
  "54002": "But if she does, what can I say to her?",
  "54003": "I suppose you have your composition all done?",
  "54004": "And are we come to that degree of misery, that our enemies themselves are expected to pity us?",
  "54005": "What did he do after he had wept?",
  "54006": "'If' you've been mistaken, you say?",
  "54007": "And what should I do with these?",
  "54008": "When do you think he ever told her that before?",
  "54009": "Would you come round with me to the registry office?",
  "54010": "But who are these strangers with you?",
  "54011": "And why is he doing this to me?",
  "54012": "Why, what age do you call that little creature?",
  "54013": "What sort of a new life can you and I look forward to?",
  "54014": "What's that after his name?",
  "54015": "What are you laughing at?",
  "54016": "First, will your ladyship allow me to ask you whether you have had any strange visitors this morning?",
  "54017": "But who will assert, that this is the only foundation of justice?",
  "54018": "Is it far off?",
  "54019": "Are you less cold now?",
  "54020": "How many steps have you told?",
  "54021": "Is it the form of the thing?",
  "54022": "How, my fault?",
  "54023": "And the meal?",
  "54024": "What have I done, that I should be the only mark of your cruelty?",
  "54025": "Was there no one in the churchyard?",
  "54026": "Well, what would she have now?",
  "54027": "What trick is this?",
  "54028": "Are the guns ready?",
  "54029": "Will you be so good as to pledge me, sir?",
  "54030": "With her?",
  "54031": "Where is the key you speak of?",
  "54032": "But where are the antennæ you spoke of?",
  "54033": "When did you come back?",
  "54034": "Not an ill wind, I hope?",
  "54035": "Eustacia?",
  "54036": "As you truly say, if we were to act in this way, what would the world come to?",
  "54037": "Oh, where shall we meet?",
  "54038": "Well, have you sent?",
  "54039": "Or why should it be forbidden that he gaze upon the sea?",
  "54040": "If I had one that I could and ought to have revealed, should I not have long ago divulged it?",

  "54046": "What should he do about his skimming?",
  "54047": "In what then does this induction differ from the induction which leads us to the conclusion that the presence of the sun is the cause of our having more light by day than by night?",
  "54048": "How much did the stiff have in his bags?",
  "54049": "You have tried to find him, then?",
  "54050": "Which side of his life did he resolve upon closing and condemning?",
  "54051": "And what is the name which the city derives from the possession of this sort of knowledge?",
  "54052": "What do you call him again?",
  "54053": "What about the hole?",
  "54054": "At the oars?",
  "54055": "To you?",
  "54056": "What is this leather cleaned with?",
  "54057": "Whar is you?",
  "54058": "How can people be dissatisfied with anything?",
  "54059": "What's to become of us?",
  "54060": "That I loved you?",
  "54061": "Geraldine, do you remember that still?",
  "54062": "Why does the floor seem hollowed out at this spot?",
  "54063": "Sagacious too?",
  "54064": "Well, have you anything more?",
  "54065": "What's the difference?",
  "54066": "What does it matter whether I forgive you?",
  "54067": "But, that being so, why did you offer?",
  "54068": "Better turn to, now?",
  "54069": "How can I marry her?",
  "54070": "But who will she be?",
  "54071": "Then he is there?",
  "54072": "Very young or very old?",
  "54073": "Shall I then conceal the cause of my distress, and not dare to seek aid and healing for my wound?",
  "54074": "And how do you propose to prove all this?",
  "54075": "Do you doubt it, my darling?",
  "54076": "Go out?",
  "54077": "Shall I ever behold her again?",
  "54078": "What city could be at rest, lawful, and orderly?",

  "54080": "Who is he that interrupts our busines?",
  "54081": "What is any newspaper article but an expression of the views taken by one side?",
  "54082": "But what could have been his motive for sending the cup to me?",
  "54083": "Who, then, shall come in at this day and claim that he invented it?",
  "54084": "And why are children born to such men as you?",
  "54085": "But the mystery?",
  "54086": "And that fellow with her, eh?",
  "54087": "Why should these pages be stained by further crimes?",
  "54088": "Have I ever excused her for it?",
  "54089": "And where are you going now?",
  "54090": "You are going to her, I hope?",
  "54091": "But I am curious to know are you trying to make a convert of me or a pervert of yourself?",
  "54092": "D'Urberville was not the first wicked man who had turned away from his wickedness to save his soul alive, and why should she deem it unnatural in him?",
  "54093": "Is it not just to yourself that you should, in a few public speeches, state your reasons, and thus justify yourself?",
  "54094": "What means that haggard face, cousin, and the collar of your dress is all wet?",
  "54095": "Have you persuaded your cousin?",

  "54946": "What shall we do, boys, till the ladies return?",
  "54947": "Well, I'd like to know what sort of a beggar's brat this is?",
  "54948": "Will you tell us at last to what end you pretend to be conducting civilization?",
  "54949": "You are truly at my service, are you not?",
  "54950": "How now, what is this?",
  "54951": "Clym, you are not jealous?",
  "54952": "For, I beseech you, by what rule or standard do you judge, when you assert, that the line, in which I have supposed them to concur, cannot make the same right line with those two, that form so small an angle betwixt them?",
  "54953": "What is it like?",
  "54954": "How had all this happened?",
  "54955": "For the unusual tumult of that throbbing bosom ?",
  "54956": "Your mother?",
  "54957": "How much was there?",
  "54958": "Do you understand everything birds say?",
  "54959": "Where is the dacoit?",
  "54960": "Give in?",
  "54961": "Where can she be, then, since there is no light in any other room except the kitchen?",
  "54962": "What could this treachery be?",
  "54963": "Did he say he would give you a situation?",
  "54964": "Do you understand what you are doing?",
  "54965": "And must my words be thus interpreted?",
  "54966": "Have you asked her the question, then?",
  "54967": "And opinion is to have an opinion?",
  "54968": "Which of the six chose you?",
  "54969": "What does this signify?",
  "54970": "Would she not be more comfortable, as I suggested, at the hotel?",
  "54971": "You had a good journey?",
  "54972": "Or has that devil made you really dumb, when he struck his nasty hand on your jaw?",
  "54973": "For?",
  "54974": "Oh, grandpapa, did you not say the colt sold for five pounds more than you expected?",
  "54975": "Did you not charge him with unbridled insolence?",
  "54976": "Where are we going?",
  "54977": "Do you suppose the dryad will come out after we go away and take it for a scarf?",
  "54978": "And where are they?",
  "54979": "What will you do in a foreign land, an enemy's country?",
  "54980": "Where'd YOU come from?",
  "54981": "But have you remarked that sight is by far the most costly and complex piece of workmanship which the artificer of the senses ever contrived?",
  "54982": "His leg, forsooth?",
  "54983": "But would you allow me the favour of a minute's private conversation?",
  "54984": "And did he give you this letter?",
  "54985": "What inconvenience can it be?",
  "54986": "What do you expect, then?",
  "54987": "Whom do you suspect?",
  "54988": "And you laugh at the king, then?",
  "54989": "Ah?",
  "54990": "But what is a dog to know in its consciousness of madness?",
  "54991": "Will you try a bit of the beef?",
  "54992": "First of all, what is the name of this river?",
  "54993": "And you preached her sermons there, did you?",
  "54994": "Do you give lessons, ma'am?",
  "54995": "How are you going?",
  "54996": "Shall we preserve and transmit it to posterity?",
  "54997": "And should he, by an impression on the minds of his creatures, think fit to impart to them some event hid in the shades of time, yet unborn, to whom would the secret be revealed by immediate inspiration?",
  "54998": "Then are we to impose all our enactments on men and none of them on women?",
  "54999": "And now what are we to do?",
  "55000": "You want to know how we came here?",
  "55001": "What then are we to understand by the objection which this paper has combated?",
  "55002": "What could he do to move this crowd and definitely to win over public opinion?",
  "55003": "Can we send the child back to the asylum?",
  "55004": "And what plainer than that he treats him then as a beast of burden?",
  "55005": "The patch or the campaign?",
  "55006": "To act?",
  "55007": "Did you, indeed?",
  "55008": "I'll go to 'em tonight and sing a wedding song, hey?",
  "55009": "In the table?",
  "55010": "Did you hear, goodman?",
  "55011": "And you'll stick to it, mother?",
  "55012": "Why talk of me?",
  "55013": "But the quarter's notice?",
  "55014": "But why I had no notice of his ire?",
  "55015": "Or is one soul in the very least degree more or less, or more or less completely, a soul than another?",
  "55016": "Will the marquis honor me by a few moments' private conversation?",
  "55017": "What were they?",
  "55018": "I suppose he's in no immediate danger?",
  "55019": "Who shall regulate all the mixed conversation of our youth, male and female together, as is the fashion of this country?",
  "55020": "Had he, on the other hand, smoked too much?",
  "55021": "What castellan that received him in his castle ever made him pay his shot?",
  "55022": "But the lock?",
  "55023": "Shall I kiss your hand upon the contract?",
  "55024": "May I ask the name?",
  "55025": "What?",
  "55026": "Strangers?",
  "55027": "Or were they there from some ulterior motive?",
  "55028": "Does it?",
  "55029": "But you'll come back to dinner?",
  "55030": "Shall I open a flask?",
  "55031": "Why bother about human relationships?",
  "55032": "And will he bring me back a bear?",
  "55033": "What would that language have been?",
  "55034": "What more can I do?",
  "55035": "Have you cried your grief away?",
  "55036": "Have you picked many of your apples yet?",
  "55037": "What was going to happen to her henceforth?",
  "55038": "Shall my father be informed of your wish?",
  "55039": "To hide, in the nature of how many women?",
  "55040": "You believed in my good fortune in the old days, do you now doubt this true story?",
  "55041": "You've not met since that night?",
  "55042": "Will you try?",
  "55043": "What course do you intend to take?",
  "55044": "Now, how shall we settle this?",
  "55045": "What is it to you?",
  "55046": "Do you think that I was then dead to agony and remorse?",
  "55047": "Any news?",
  "55048": "Is there no end to it?",
  "55049": "But a ricordo of what?",
  "55050": "How many times have we had danger from this question?",
  "55051": "Which is the part in man, which, as he grows fatter, never gains flesh?",
  "55052": "And next, how does he live?",
  "55053": "Am not I here, whom you have made your creature?",
  "55054": "Do you want to hire any men?",
  "55055": "News?",
  "55056": "You are a scholar too, I dare say?",
  "55057": "Did you come here to fetch me?",
  "55058": "In praising his generosity, who can mingle any censure for such manifest prudence?",
  "55059": "Have you come to see me or my mother?",
  "55060": "Nelly gave it to him?",
  "55061": "What the devil do I see yonder?",
  "55062": "And your previous dreams, were they real too?",
  "55063": "Do you want to see me?",
  "55064": "Hucky, do you das't to go if I lead?",
  "55065": "Did you get here quickly?",
  "55066": "What was their reply?",
  "55067": "Does one know?",
  "55068": "What's the beadig of this?",
  "55069": "Not one word of comfort?",
  "55070": "May I ask of what breed he is sprung?",
  "55071": "What sort of grim adventure was it on which I had embarked?",
  "55072": "Would you have done it?",
  "55073": "Will you not give up this plan?",
  "55074": "But could you not be mended?",
  "55075": "Does that seem like too much work?",
  "55076": "Who are these creatures?",
  "55077": "What witnesses would support my statements?",
  "55078": "You remember what are the properties of two similar triangles?",
  "55079": "WELL, and how does success taste?",
  "55080": "She would be ashamed of her mother, you mean, and of her mother's brother too, eh?",
  "55081": "Mates, do you hear that?",
  "55082": "Of what do you complain?",
  "55083": "You know what it is to be in love?",
  "55084": "In the smuggling line?",
  "55085": "Do you wish to say anything further to him?",
  "55086": "Hussey?",
  "55087": "Had it not been pity so good a man should have been cast away?",
  "55088": "Why do we prize changing organism more than inorganic matter, unchanging and constant?",
  "55089": "But is this a defence?",
  "55090": "You perceive then the utter impossibility of escaping through your dungeon?",
  "55091": "You like this weather?",
  "55092": "Then, does he write?",
  "55093": "What of it, then?",
  "55094": "Well, are they at home, my good man?",
  "55095": "WAS IT A PARTISAN PROSECUTION?",
  "55096": "When houses are owned by loyal citizens, but are unoccupied?",
  "55097": "Are we really quite lost, your excellency?",
  "55098": "Look here, dear prince, BE so kind, will you?",
  "55099": "Is it not well that such men should be brought low?",
  "55100": "And what is the new one like?",
  "55101": "Do you not see how the old man who drives a cart looks anxiously about?",
  "55102": "What will you eat?",
  "55103": "Is my peace nothing?",
  "55104": "What business is 't of yours?",
  "55105": "You are right, clearness is what you wish, is it not?",
  "55106": "And you say this young man behaved himself well?",
  "55107": "Are we not to put on our diver's dresses?",
  "55108": "But for what purpose is it your idea that they should again so intimately meet?",
  "55109": "Let you steer?",
  "55110": "But, tell me, what do you ask?",
  "55111": "How about opening our letters?",
  "55112": "But what is the cause of this increasing humidity?",
  "55113": "Are you in contentment now?",
  "55114": "And from what?",
  "55115": "How much will that be?",
  "55116": "And in all these cases, the recollection may be derived from things either like or unlike?",
  "55117": "What are you staring at?",
  "55118": "Home?",
  "55119": "How much do I owe you?",
  "55120": "Of my old friends?",
  "55121": "The devil's agents may be of flesh and blood, may they not?",
  "55122": "Did she tell you of this?",
  "55123": "Do I date it?",
  "55124": "Or shall we say, that it is of any service in the conduct of life, and an assistant to prudence?",
  "55125": "What shall I try this time?",
  "55126": "Call you this dying?",
  "55127": "And why weep for this?",
  "55128": "How is it you are on foot?",
  "55129": "So you're a messenger of victory, eh?",
  "55130": "Had he eyebrows like that?",
  "55131": "What is there I care for?",
  "55132": "Was it still night?",
  "55133": "Who was this almost beardless young man, who was so glacial and so generous, who knew people's names, who knew all their names, and who opened his purse to them, who bullied rascals like a judge, and who paid them like a dupe?",
  "55134": "Why came I here to cast away my life?",
  "55135": "The old gentleman over the way?",
  "55136": "Did you say, four ladies?",
  "55137": "Do you still wish to dispose of all?",
  "55138": "Does he tell lies?",
  "55139": "I wonder what it can be?",
  "55140": "Why should this place lie idle?",
  "55141": "Do you see this little door and little house?",
  "55142": "Do these correspond to the phases of apprehension?",
  "55143": "Am I not a member of the consulting commission?",
  "55144": "What's your pay?",
  "55145": "Who told you so?",
  "55146": "For whom were the soldiers below at the carriage waiting?",
  "55147": "Must the citizen ever for a moment, or in the least degree, resign his conscience to the legislator?",
  "55148": "Do you want to cross the channel?",
  "55149": "But can this be so confidently said of sexual selection?",
  "55150": "And is there any hope of that, sir?",
  "55151": "Where are you going?",
  "55152": "You will appear at this ball?",
  "55153": "What did I come for?",
  "55154": "Whose?",
  "55155": "This is where he lives, is it?",
  "55156": "But what does all this mean?",
  "55157": "And have you a pale blue dress on?",
  "55158": "And in the course of that month?",
  "55159": "If there were one man who would carry you a medical reform and another who would oppose it, should you inquire which had the better motives or even the better brains?",
  "55160": "Who can live the same moment twice?",
  "55161": "What did he say in that one?",
  "55162": "Is it true that you received there a man who is your lover?",
  "55163": "Is any man, in these days, sensible, seeing what a racket we have to live among?",
  "55164": "Quis custodiet istos custodes?",
  "55165": "Let's sit here for a bit, shall we?",
  "55166": "How many days would it require to make two studs exactly like them?",
  "55167": "Then is not this test reliable?",
  "55168": "What could it be, once more?",
  "55169": "Have you neglected to obtain information on that point?",
  "55170": "When do the servants go to bed?",
  "55171": "Why take I not my pleasure when I may, seeing that I never need lack for occasions of trouble and vexation of spirit?",
  "55172": "He passes along the same path at the same hour, and to whom should he be going except to the convict?",
  "55173": "And the murderer?",
  "55174": "How might it come to pass that we should all die there, through anybody's hate?",
  "55175": "What did he do there?",
  "55176": "Are you not?",
  "55177": "And the queens?",
  "55178": "What are they doing?",
  "55179": "Len, you will make it all right?",
  "55180": "The car?",
  "55181": "Was he, or was he not, the father of the young girl?",
  "55182": "He only peeps?",
  "55183": "When will you come to see me?",
  "55184": "What would you wish for, girls, if you could have a wish granted?",
  "55185": "What can I be?",
  "55186": "Why, what were you going to do?",
  "55187": "How then could you have recognized me, if you have never seen my portrait or my person?",
  "55188": "Whose name?",
  "55189": "What does she carry?",
  "55190": "What has he got, this time?",
  "55191": "Why, what?",
  "55192": "Why had everybody been in such a frantic hurry in this matter?",
  "55193": "How old are they?",
  "55194": "How would a boy like that?",
  "55195": "O was she so?",
  "55196": "Because, if it was so long ago, how could the people about him have made that mistake of putting some of the trouble out of his head, after it was taken off, into mine?",
  "55197": "To place yourself under his protection?",
  "55198": "Why should I object?",
  "55199": "What but a future of patient labor?",
  "55200": "How is your father getting on?",
  "55201": "These walls are you going, gentlemen?",
  "55202": "Where is such a judge to be found?",
  "55203": "Why, then, is he not indemnified?",
  "55204": "Why did they do it?",
  "55205": "These were the exact words, my beloved husband, were they not?",
  "55206": "Is it for my own pleasure that I am at the farm or in the office from morning to night?",
  "55207": "He is not resident, then?",
  "55208": "Is the swallow in sight?",
  "55209": "What kind of fish?",
  "55210": "Where had she seen those lineaments before?",
  "55211": "Why must he?",
  "55212": "What has she written to me?",
  "55213": "Have you ever been on it?",
  "55214": "What do you mean?",
  "55215": "Are you sure she is safe?",
  "55216": "Can he be inconstant before being happy?",
  "55217": "Ah, your honor, how can you say so?",
  "55218": "If it be only a struggle for a new balance of power, who will guarantee, who can guarantee, the stable equilibrium of the new arrangement?",
  "55219": "Why should it not be known?",
  "55220": "What was the good of talking, any way?",
  "55221": "Because the higher he flies, the fewer?",
  "55222": "Think better of what?",
  "55223": "Should they end by both getting lost, and by furnishing two skeletons in a nook of that night?",
  "55224": "What is your name, my friend?",
  "55225": "Or could it be that within lay the secret to the treasure stores?",
  "55226": "Are you satisfied, gentlemen?",
  "55227": "The name of your ship?",
  "55228": "Wish to consult me on the matter?",
  "55229": "And can we tell, how long he may choose to respect those conditions?",
  "55230": "Do you press me to tell?",
  "55231": "How can I support this?",
  "55232": "How shall we live through the long winter here?",
  "55233": "You have actually seen the members of the legislature?",
  "55234": "And if he wakes up presently, where shall we be?",
  "55235": "And the best hack?",
  "55236": "Why do you not turn round and speak to me properly?",
  "55237": "What's in the bottle, boy?",
  "55238": "Of what was he thinking during this profound depression?",
  "55239": "How is it that it opposed no resistance to the motion of comets which have almost grazed the sun's surface?",
  "55240": "Who is that woman?",
  "55241": "Well then, do it, will you?",
  "55242": "Stolen from you?",
  "55243": "The fat woman who goes about in a green blouse?",
  "55244": "Who should quail while they do not?",
  "55245": "How many acres?",
  "55246": "Wherein especially does the poetry of our times differ from that of the last century?",
  "55247": "To stuff every hole with some kind of oakum?",
  "55248": "Do you not believe, then, that we women deserve to be loved?",
  "55249": "But what was the state of the conquerors?",
  "55250": "May I have the honor?",
  "55251": "Where is the gentle one?",
  "55252": "What is there now to warrant the condition of affairs presented by our friends over the river?",
  "55253": "Once more, how do you know?",
  "55254": "This must be a strange night to you, standing alone here with your counterpart on these street stones?",
  "55255": "But what are you talking about?",
  "55256": "Hold your tongue, will you?",
  "55257": "Who cares for me?",
  "55258": "When passed?",
  "55259": "How is it going?",
  "55260": "If, however, your wish should be one impossible to fulfill?",
  "55261": "Why do you not leave me alone?",
  "55262": "Where are they to come from?",
  "55263": "Louisa saw her when she came?",
  "55264": "Why did you look at the sunset?",
  "55265": "Why did they insist so strenuously upon this, and incorporate it into their philosophy?",
  "55266": "Shall I ring for candles, sir?",
  "55267": "Oh, why should I be made to worry?",
  "55268": "Have you found your tramp?",
  "55269": "With whom?",
  "55270": "Do you see the joke?",
  "55271": "But why this elaborate deception?",
  "55272": "Should you mind?",
  "55273": "And literature may be either true or false?",
  "55274": "Is there more, then?",
  "55275": "What if they had?",
  "55276": "HAS HE WIT?",
  "55277": "Lackeys?",
  "55278": "Why should we defer our joys?",
  "55279": "How is the poor little wounded girl?",
  "55280": "Can we do anything for you?",
  "55281": "I think I could?",
  "55282": "Was this a joke, then?",
  "55283": "Why does she come prowling here?",
  "55284": "No mental inconvenience, I hope?",
  "55285": "There has been fighting, then?",
  "55286": "What irritated this mollusc?",
  "55287": "Or man, indeed?",
  "55288": "Where do you come from?",

  "55291": "I hope you suffer no inconvenience from the overturn, ma'am?",
  "55292": "Is not wounded vanity the mother of all tragedies?",
  "55293": "But why should it have been otherwise?",
  "55294": "Ask her, does she do this for amusement, or does she expect to earn money by it?",
  "55295": "Would that volatile mind, that inconstant heart, be likely to be fixed for a moment, even were it to gaze upon an angel?",
  "55296": "Lily, will you say that it shall be so?",
  "55297": "Pray you what do you mean, sir?",
  "55298": "Tomorrow, then?",
  "55299": "Into what whirlpool had she been dragged?",
  "55300": "Will nothing convince you?",
  "55301": "Do they fish for them in these days?",
  "55302": "And why of them to be ?",
  "55303": "And the horse?",
  "55304": "To what end was I born with exquisite faculties?",
  "55305": "Why yes, am I not devoted body and soul to your majesty?",
  "55306": "Why, what of them?",
  "55307": "Oh, but are you going to her?",
  "55308": "How is your uncle pleased with him?",
  "55309": "How the devil could it be otherwise in her frightful isolation?",
  "55310": "Would he not suddenly sink into the earth, leaving a barren and blasted spot, where, in due course of time, would be seen deadly nightshade, dogwood, henbane, and whatever else of vegetable wickedness the climate could produce, all flourishing with hideous luxuriance?",
  "55311": "Do you think that the tree really did cure toothache, if one believed in it?",
  "55312": "Then will you consider about it, neighbour?",
  "55313": "Hurt?",
  "55314": "Swerve me?",
  "55315": "And what kind was she?",
  "55316": "Monsieur, and in what respect not?",
  "55317": "Have you wanted money, father?",
  "55318": "Is not your city in my power?",
  "55319": "What is this ideal?",
  "55320": "Is an indefinite power to raise money dangerous in the hands of the federal government?",
  "55321": "What more can you demand?",
  "55322": "Taken forfeit of their mortgage?",

  "55324": "It is not so, brother?",
  "55325": "Any why not this evening?",
  "55326": "Has he been to sea?",
  "55327": "The little people, the poor, the unhappy, well, what of them?",
  "55328": "And now, guess what your good children were doing?",
  "55329": "Why should they care if they were known?",
  "55330": "Man to beast?",
  "55331": "But what's the use of talking?",
  "55332": "Carter?",
  "55333": "A pair of gloves?",
  "55334": "Why, for instance, should it be said that the liberty of the press shall not be restrained, when no power is given by which restrictions may be imposed?",
  "55335": "Heard what?",
  "55336": "And you have told her about the picture?",
  "55337": "Who said so?",
  "55338": "But how hae they been keepit quiet, think ye?",

  "55486": "Sir, are you here?",
  "55487": "But in extreames what patience shall I vse?",

  "55492": "Where are you going, marechal?",
  "55493": "Who could hear unmoved of the fall of that which had been so great, and which had stood so long?",
  "55494": "Did he wish to wait until night, and leave the submarine passage secretly?",
  "55495": "Is there anything more?",
  "55496": "Because you're so sure he so really wants my company?",
  "55497": "Do you particularly object to ladies studying?",

  "55502": "So we may not enter into transgression?",
  "55503": "Who dares mock at him?",

  "55519": "Does that person want you?",
  "55520": "Will he explain it?",
  "55521": "Was he to be carried back by the wind which had blown him there?",
  "55522": "What is to be done then?",
  "55523": "Where is a candle?",
  "55524": "May they not have believed, in fact, that it was a plant fallen from the sky, a gift of the divinity?",
  "55525": "Hearty, I thank you, said he, how be you?",
  "55526": "Whuzya think, hey?",
  "55527": "And why, then, did you not refuse him?",

  "55552": "But who will lead?",
  "55553": "But, my dear, is not this rather out of character?",
  "55554": "Or a woman?",
  "55555": "Well, if so, why do you object to my doing so?",
  "55556": "Are you the boy I've read of in the papers?",
  "55557": "Oh, what's wrong?",
  "55558": "What's the use?",
  "55559": "And if he let go his hold?",

  "55562": "Are you still resolved to accompany me?",
  "55563": "What does he do?",
  "55564": "Why did you keep me waiting so long?",
  "55565": "Can I say of her innocent and girlish beauty, that it faded, and was no more, when its breath falls on my cheek now, as it fell that night?",
  "55566": "Do you know why?",
  "55567": "Why, what's the MATTER with you?",
  "55568": "My dear friend, what has happened?",
  "55569": "You had no idea of your impending good fortune, in those times?",
  "55570": "Do you think you can better yourselves, on that subject, by leaving us here under no obligation whatever to return those specimens of your movable property that come hither?",
  "55571": "Nice?",
  "55572": "May its poppet come in and talk?",
  "55573": "Yet still I have my uses, uses that vanish in monotony, and still I must ask why should we bury the talent of these bright sensations altogether?",
  "55574": "And what was it this time last year?",
  "55575": "But what is theory?",
  "55576": "Then, sir, you are satisfied?",
  "55577": "And what if he had?",
  "55578": "And why is he here?",
  "55579": "That is your final decision?",

  "55590": "Something extraordinary must await us farther on, but, what?",
  "55591": "When shall I wake?",
  "55592": "And do you really flatter yourself that I shall yield to all your caprices, and quietly and humbly await the time of again being received into your good graces?",
  "55593": "What had he come there to do?",
  "55594": "And how stands the fact?",
  "55595": "Do you ever work, child?",
  "55596": "You hear, sir?",
  "55597": "What would you do if you were in my place?",
  "55598": "The gentleman to whom I had the honour of being introduced?",
  "55599": "Not to see the father?",
  "55600": "Will you overlook it this once and forgive me, and let things go on as before?",
  "55601": "What am I to tell him?",
  "55602": "Where do you come from?",
  "55603": "And what did you say about it, bishop?",
  "55604": "Then why are we here, my friends?",

  "55609": "All as it should be, is it not?",
  "55610": "Is that strong on him still?",
  "55611": "Do you want to go to all of them?",
  "55612": "What shall I think of this?",
  "55613": "Come, now, what do you want?",
  "55614": "Daae not see you come down from your room by the curious road which you selected?",
  "55615": "But as a man of honor should answer another, tell me fairly, shall you pay these with the same punctuality?",
  "55616": "And when doth this take place?",
  "55617": "But his stables had been searched?",
  "55618": "But, it will be asked further, can I make any use of this conception and hypothesis in my investigations into the world and nature?",
  "55619": "Of his own desire?",
  "55620": "Why should anyone pay?",
  "55621": "What do you wish of me?",
  "55622": "Pay?",
  "55623": "Home?",

  "55631": "And will no murmurs fill the courts above?",
  "55632": "When?",
  "55633": "Marriage?",
  "55634": "Then that is all quite settled, is it not?",
  "55635": "Or cometh it in person?",
  "55636": "What more can we do?",
  "55637": "What in the world does the man mean?",
  "55638": "What does anybody want here?",
  "55639": "Why, do you know how pretty you are, child?",
  "55640": "Will you not allow that I have as much of the spirit of prophecy in me as the swans?",
  "55641": "Shall we wait, or shall we charge?",
  "55642": "Ere I was old?",
  "55643": "What is this dim and ambiguous consciousness which, after a certain time, becomes purified, rectified, and, instead of taking itself for another, definitively apprehends itself as such?",
  "55644": "Do you know his man?",
  "55645": "Will you so?",
  "55646": "Who are the true martyrs, of those who are slain on my side, or on that of my enemies?",
  "55647": "Well, what hinders your sleeping?",
  "55648": "And you'll be my friend?",
  "55649": "May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?",
  "55650": "What do you mean to say?",
  "55651": "How about prying?",
  "55652": "Then he could not have retreated down the road, and you say that there are no side roads?",
  "55653": "Qui est ton pere?",
  "55654": "Yea, why should his father let him, if it come to that?",
  "55655": "Briefly, what did you glean?",
  "55656": "Gone, you say she is?",
  "55657": "Why does there come an hour when one emerges from this azure, and why does life go on afterwards?",
  "55658": "What has broken your heart?",
  "55659": "Do you think you will find that spring soon?",
  "55660": "How was I?",
  "55661": "And why do the children, the grandchildren, all the descendants of the first parents always return here?",
  "55662": "By whom?",
  "55663": "But then, what?",
  "55664": "Arm's length?",
  "55665": "Him as wos dead?",
  "55666": "What is its object?",
  "55667": "Are we never to educate ourselves to foresee such dangers and to prevent them before they happen?",
  "55668": "So that you may both get tipsy, is that it, and stay here gabbing all day?",
  "55669": "Why was she brought here?",
  "55670": "I, my lord?",
  "55671": "Am I really wonderful?",
  "55672": "Well, was there?",
  "55673": "What is she sentenced to?",
  "55674": "And how much for one that's all chewed up like this one?",

  "55688": "Where could you keep it?",
  "55689": "And that of a fluid body?",
  "55690": "Had HE his idea, and has he now, with you, anything more?",
  "55691": "Who took any?",
  "55692": "Was he true to them?",
  "55693": "Why should he not?",
  "55694": "Afraid of being heard?",
  "55695": "Will this ever take place in reality?",

  "55704": "But what can I do, sister?",
  "55705": "Well, are you coming?",
  "55706": "It was from your wife, we supposed?",
  "55707": "And had I wasted some of the best years of my life to obtain a shadow?",
  "55708": "Ernest was much distressed, for he liked the cook, and, of course, wanted to know what all the matter was, who it was that had just gone off in the pony carriage, and why?",

  "56523": "And the women?",
  "56524": "Suppose I do not want to be happy, what is the source of the obligation?",
  "56525": "Or the generous deed out of selfishness?",
  "56526": "Were you sent here to praise me?",
  "56527": "How do you feel now, dear?",
  "56528": "She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?",
  "56529": "You know him, then?",
  "56530": "Will he always come when you call him?",
  "56531": "And what has that to do with me?",
  "56532": "Why compliment him on being a romantic reactionary aristocrat?",
  "56533": "In the first place, and before everything else, sir, is the news as bad in your opinion as I am asked to believe?",
  "56534": "But how was it that the grooms knew it?",
  "56535": "Will you appoint a meeting for six months hence?",
  "56536": "Find it easy?",
  "56537": "Were they going over to the other side?",
  "56538": "So you will send me that book, dear count?",
  "56539": "But it's over now?",
  "56540": "Am I talking?",
  "56541": "And to what?",
  "56542": "Have I always hated you so much?",
  "56543": "How does he use it?",
  "56544": "You will sing with me?",
  "56545": "Grant?",
  "56546": "What did I borrow?",
  "56547": "Am I not clearly designated in that, captain?",
  "56548": "And with what purpose could he do that?",
  "56549": "What is it that this polypragmonetic ardelion to all the fiends of hell doth aim at?",
  "56550": "What has happened that you should speak like that?",
  "56551": "What means, then, this dithyramb upon property?",
  "56552": "And where afterwards?",
  "56553": "What reason was there for assuming any probability of an uprising in the city?",
  "56554": "Ah, friends, what shall I do?",
  "56555": "Do we not both take from the poor people that which they can ill spare?",
  "56556": "What is the place, then, upon which we stand?",
  "56557": "Is he a man of fortune?",
  "56558": "How dare to repeat experiments that had failed so often?",
  "56559": "There is still another influence, what do you say to that?",
  "56560": "What makes you ask?",
  "56561": "Now, who can this other letter be from?",
  "56562": "But how is it he is not already returned?",
  "56563": "What is to be the manner of her death?",
  "56564": "Wizard?",
  "56565": "And, conversely, that which has less of truth will also have less of essence?",
  "56566": "You mean that they would shipwreck?",
  "56567": "Swinging by the chain?",
  "56568": "What put it into your head, little mother?",
  "56569": "Then it is very thin wine?",
  "56570": "Did I offer to hit him or did I not?",
  "56571": "And what temperature may that be?",
  "56572": "Have you a pair of silent shoes?",
  "56573": "Who else should do so?",
  "56574": "And to what effect?",
  "56575": "I shall meet them there, and who knows what future advantages may result from the interview?",
  "56576": "Could it have been aught but a shipwreck which had drawn it under the water?",
  "56577": "The song?",
  "56578": "Shall you go?",
  "56579": "How are you, my dear?",
  "56580": "Why then not trace the rights of man to the creation of man?",
  "56581": "How did you know about it?",
  "56582": "How about that?",
  "56583": "Who knows it?",
  "56584": "You were alluding to the jerking movement of my hand every time I try to reach for anything?",
  "56585": "What the devil was you afraid of?",
  "56586": "What did he do before he went?",
  "56587": "Your alphabet?",
  "56588": "What's up?",
  "56589": "Which house is that?",
  "56590": "What's your real name?",
  "56591": "Why were they so strangely silent?",
  "56592": "Is it an amusing story?",
  "56593": "You were, were you not?",
  "56594": "Do you find the answer?",
  "56595": "At last she is dead?",
  "56596": "Time to start?",
  "56597": "You understand?",
  "56598": "But how did you know that I was a prisoner back there?",
  "56599": "Wherein?",
  "56600": "Which do you prefer?",
  "56601": "What can be more gratifying than such a retrospect as this?",
  "56602": "What did she say?",
  "56603": "Oh, indeed?",
  "56604": "Besides, which am I to choose?",
  "56605": "Instead, then, of consecrating monopolies from which the holders are to derive no privilege save that of straightway losing, with the income, all the enjoyment thereof, why not decree the agrarian law at once?",
  "56606": "Go to?",
  "56607": "But how could I, a poor dazed village lad, avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best and wisest of men fall every day?",
  "56608": "Well, why not?",
  "56609": "What does it all mean?",
  "56610": "I may assume that there is a second to be mentioned?",
  "56611": "Your father is dead?",
  "56612": "Of whom?",
  "56613": "Natasha, you would not deceive me?",
  "56614": "What were you doing in the battle, my friend?",
  "56615": "But does not this expose himself more than me?",
  "56616": "And is not this the reason why of old love has been called a tyrant?",
  "56617": "What are you doing here?",
  "56618": "Why not take a number of banths and set them loose before us above ground?",
  "56619": "How long did he wear it?",
  "56620": "Is he not a prey which will always be within your grasp?",
  "56621": "What instructing do you think I should do?",
  "56622": "What took her away?",
  "56623": "Yes, how long?",
  "56624": "Is it not the separation of soul and body?",
  "56625": "It is said to have been a congestion of the brain, or apoplexy, which is the same thing, is it not?",
  "56626": "Executions?",
  "56627": "Have commissioned you to tell me what you have just stated?",
  "56628": "Remorse or regret?",
  "56629": "How am I to describe it?",
  "56630": "Tulkinghorn?",
  "56631": "Why are you smiling, prince?",
  "56632": "And if he had not, why did he take her again?",
  "56633": "That is your intention, is it not?",
  "56634": "Will it pass?",
  "56635": "Why did you pick him?",
  "56636": "Do you suppose these stoneless mounds hide no dust of what were men just as good?",
  "56637": "Where are those passionate eyes that appeal'd to my eyes in passion?",
  "56638": "What is it that you say you are going to do?",
  "56639": "What did she send?",
  "56640": "Should he find him at all?",
  "56641": "Why should I meddle?",
  "56642": "The earlier it might be, would it not be better?",
  "56643": "The theories say that, do they?",
  "56644": "And what hope was there that these designs would fail?",
  "56645": "Not from the photos I have showed you?",
  "56646": "Have you ever noticed that the ones we would love the most distractedly are those whom we never meet to know?",
  "56647": "Well, then, my lord, say, are you satisfied?",
  "56648": "Gentlemen, do you stare?",
  "56649": "Well, what do you want?",
  "56650": "Why, monsieur, what secret can you expect to find in the hollow head of a soldier?",
  "56651": "Are you going to return there?",
  "56652": "What need has it of exaggeration?",
  "56653": "What if she loves you now better than anyone?",
  "56654": "Do you happen to know any one in this neighbourhood who would receive him for a while on my paying for him beforehand?",
  "56655": "He has done his best, but what does a fish's best come to when the fish is out of water?",
  "56656": "You are a reactionary, then?",
  "56657": "What's up, anyhow?",
  "56658": "Will there, indeed?",
  "56659": "Who drove you to it?",
  "56660": "We being strangers here, how dare you trust so great a charge from your own custody?",
  "56661": "You are a wheelwright?",
  "56662": "Does that suit you?",
  "56663": "Is anything the matter, aunt?",
  "56664": "And shall we just carelessly allow children to hear any casual tales which may be devised by casual persons, and to receive into their minds ideas for the most part the very opposite of those which we should wish them to have when they are grown up?",
  "56665": "But did be profess any attachment?",
  "56666": "Who are you, madame?",
  "56667": "Did you ever taste beer?",
  "56668": "Boomer?",
  "56669": "Does he mean to say that?",
  "56670": "How much fudder is got for go?",
  "56671": "And when hereafter, for any cause, the people in this place shall desire to find new homes, if they wish to be rid of the institution, where will they find the place to go to?",
  "56672": "And what would their parents think of me, if they saw or heard the children rioting, hatless, bonnetless, gloveless, and bootless, in the deep soft snow?",
  "56673": "Is anyone up in your house?",
  "56674": "Will that suit you?",
  "56675": "Have I not explained your wishes, grandpapa?",
  "56676": "Did you see it?",
  "56677": "And, to be frank, my lord, was I wrong?",
  "56678": "From what?",
  "56679": "Herod?",
  "56680": "Cautious, why so?",
  "56681": "Was it the better to deceive them both?",
  "56682": "Did you tell us?",
  "56683": "Do you understand what you have done to me?",
  "56684": "Nor church?",
  "56685": "Does it end with just our two selves?",
  "56686": "Will there be beds for me and all who seek?",
  "56687": "What virtue will there be then, said the monk, in their bullets of concupiscence, their habits and their bodies?",
  "56688": "How do I know?",
  "56689": "In what direction?",
  "56690": "And of such a man too?",
  "56691": "What good am I here?",
  "56692": "Do you mean what did I say?",
  "56693": "What did the whole world matter to them?",
  "56694": "You feel some pretty well now?",
  "56695": "The man says?",
  "56696": "How should I make a mistake?",
  "56697": "Will you have hash or fishballs for breakfast?",
  "56698": "What signifies?",
  "56699": "Did she mean to go out?",
  "56700": "Where is she?",
  "56701": "Do you know where they came from?",
  "56702": "Did you see him come out on us?",
  "56703": "Why lie awake nights worrying about this?",
  "56704": "And if I did not obey his call, who could answer for what might happen?",
  "56705": "Or worse than the parts they acted require?",
  "56706": "What did you go out for?",
  "56707": "Well, then, what's the sense in wasting the plates?",
  "56708": "Can we not, then, men of common sense, while awaiting the solution which the future will undoubtedly bring forth, prepare ourselves for this great transition by an analysis of the struggling powers, as well as their positive and negative qualities?",
  "56709": "Have you not lately renewed your promise?",
  "56710": "Whose are these beautiful green meadows?",
  "56711": "And why do we set our soul and body, which are such dear companions, at such variance?",
  "56712": "Living together?",
  "56713": "Did you never hear it?",
  "56714": "And what else is paper currency?",
  "56715": "And do you propose to make this journey very shortly?",
  "56716": "But what if fresh disasters should take place?",
  "56717": "Who will say they were not beautiful?",
  "56718": "Is anybody to come and fetch me?",
  "56719": "But when?",
  "56720": "And what explanation is given of the girl's death?",
  "56721": "What was the dreadful thing I dreamed?",
  "56722": "I should think it was a very pleasant life, the married one, eh?",
  "56723": "But what shall we reply to the medals, undoubtedly genuine, which reckon the fifth year of his tribunitian power?",
  "56724": "Have we either of us ever rubbed thumbs over honestly gained farthings?",
  "56725": "Ah, you are the young woman come to look after my birds?",
  "56726": "Why could not I, going up to bed with my basket of keys, stop to sit down by her fire and accommodate myself for a little while to her, at least as well as to anybody else, and not trouble myself about the harmless things she said to me?",
  "56727": "In order, perhaps, to give countenance to the objection at any rate, it may be asked, is there not danger of an opposite bias in the national government, which may dispose it to endeavor to secure a monopoly of the federal administration to the landed class?",
  "56728": "How can we help it?",
  "56729": "Why do you ask such a question, I said, when you ought rather to be answering?",
  "56730": "Would you say six or four years?",
  "56731": "Would you shoot a poor, defenceless girl?",
  "56732": "Which is the duke?",
  "56733": "Now, are you ready?",
  "56734": "Can you write shorthand?",
  "56735": "Yes, why did I not steal?",
  "56736": "Will you say it is because the body is the medium of suffering in this life?",
  "56737": "Now you will be able to go home and tell your friends that you have personally seen and heard the southern lights, for I suppose you have no doubt that you have really done so?",
  "56738": "And are who what?",
  "56739": "You are of my opinion?",
  "56740": "Could it be possible that the squire was going to make a fool of himself and get married?",
  "56741": "But you will?",
  "56742": "How much is it?",
  "56743": "You will permit me to consider him an invalid?",
  "56744": "Where is he concealed?",
  "56745": "But was it his fault?",
  "56746": "You spoke to my coachman, then?",
  "56747": "Was the photograph a cabinet?",
  "56748": "Who's go dar?",
  "56749": "For the commission, is it not my whole future?",
  "56750": "Why all this excitement?",
  "56751": "Do you know the numbers?",
  "56752": "Do you wish you may die if you do know, hey?",
  "56753": "Why then should he repine when the hour of separation arrives?",
  "56754": "She had no reason for walking elsewhere, and why should she not go that way?",
  "56755": "Where is the knave?",
  "56756": "Any news, father?",
  "56757": "When did you see him last?",
  "56758": "Why, pray, did he add the old day?",
  "56759": "You think he went off just by chance?",
  "56760": "Is the cause of my soreness such a mystery that there's any need to tell me I am sore everywhere the staff hit me?",
  "56761": "What be these two, signior?",
  "56762": "Can anyone here play the drum?",
  "56763": "Shall you like to have such a brother?",
  "56764": "And what is better than woman?",
  "56765": "Ye much hurt?",
  "56766": "How shall I ever look this man in the face again?",
  "56767": "Yes?",
  "56768": "You think there may be fighting?",
  "56769": "Could it be that by some neglect in the preparations, the substitution perhaps of the wrong brandy, the astralization could not be effected?",
  "56770": "Was this to her doom after all?",
  "56771": "How agreed?",
  "56772": "And those papers?",
  "56773": "How is the gentleman called?",
  "56774": "What do you mean, you minx?",
  "56775": "What can be done?",
  "56776": "And why are we here?",
  "56777": "Amontillado ?",
  "56778": "A coffin?",
  "56779": "Does it suggest anything to your mind?",
  "56780": "Is the second floor at home?",
  "56781": "Could I forget that last autumn at this same day of the month and at this same place you lighted exactly such a fire as a signal for me to come and see you?",
  "56782": "You are certain?",
  "56783": "Why, did you not hear all we said?",
  "56784": "How, how?",
  "56785": "Is this statement true?",
  "56786": "How would you find experimentally the relative quantities of heat given off when equal weights of sulphur, phosphorus, and carbon are thoroughly burned?",
  "56787": "Then it is my place to ask you what you are going to do about it?",
  "56788": "Why are you up so early, my dear?",
  "56789": "Who will tell her?",
  "56790": "Guilty, of course?",
  "56791": "Do you laugh, you unfeeling brute, as if you enjoyed my distress?",
  "56792": "What enjoyment is there in making love to a woman who belongs to nobody and yet belongs to any one?",
  "56793": "Have you not a word to say to me?",
  "56794": "Two drunken men, eh?",
  "56795": "What need they torture their heads with that which others have taken so strictly and so unalterably into their own purveying?",
  "56796": "What can be more natural and characteristic?",
  "56797": "Is there anything particular?",
  "56798": "What are you upset about?",
  "56799": "But the bogus inspector?",
  "56800": "And where are the children?",
  "56801": "There are then people who inhabit it?",
  "56802": "Her happiness?",
  "56803": "Please, ma'am, could I inquire if this highly instructive and charming institution is a new one?",
  "56804": "Is it not conceivable, at least, that obedience to an unselfish impulse may result even in the sacrifice of the opportunities of moral culture in general?",
  "56805": "But why not?",
  "56806": "How would they address us?",
  "56807": "Is there any thing new in this doctrine?",
  "56808": "What was she to say to him?",
  "56809": "You doubt it then?",
  "56810": "What sense is there in murdering a man in order to define one's relation to a guilty wife and son?",
  "56811": "And what are the comforts or the education which a race of beings corrupted from their infancy, and unacquainted with all the duties of life, are fitted to bestow?",
  "56812": "Then this new kind of knowledge must have an additional quality?",
  "56813": "How do you mean, bold?",
  "56814": "They taught you that?",
  "56815": "But you, critic, the reader undoubtedly will ask, what is your solution?",
  "56816": "But the heat developed by the rapidity of the projectile in crossing the strata of air?",
  "56817": "Well, are you trying to make out that I've said you have?",
  "56818": "Three days ago?",
  "56819": "What is it, a man?",
  "56820": "Whom do you think that is to?",
  "56821": "The lighted window, right up there?",
  "56822": "But if I lose?",
  "56823": "There, who are you?",
  "56824": "Or, perhaps, you may have the precious object she wants in your collection?",
  "56825": "Who do you think should be sent there?",
  "56826": "And what for?",
  "56827": "Should he place his catastrophe as a third associate in their felicity?",
  "56828": "Can you speak, lady?",
  "56829": "Do what?",
  "56830": "That so?",
  "56831": "And you followed the business of a tailor?",
  "56832": "But how did you gain them?",
  "56833": "Whither should they go, and where should be the new seat of the mission?",
  "56834": "How does his apoplex?",
  "56835": "Ca vous amuse, la vie?",
  "56836": "You would throw over one that has stood by you this five years in favour of a man that you never saw before in your life?",
  "56837": "Ceremonies then are a subsequent thing?",
  "56838": "What can be keeping him?",
  "56839": "Some intrigue, D'Herblay?",
  "56840": "Why do you laugh, sir?",
  "56841": "Should she speak to her?",
  "56842": "Should she open the door or should she not?",
  "56843": "Now, while you have tyranny in so great a degree walled in, and see your enemies over your heads, to what purpose is it to take counsel?",
  "56844": "You do not know that you love me?",
  "56845": "What in thunder has that to do with you?",
  "56846": "No one at home?",
  "56847": "How is it over?",
  "56848": "Is it business?",
  "56849": "What's a ball through the chest?",
  "56850": "Has he found time to tell you scandal about me?",
  "56851": "Well how can I help it?",
  "56852": "What has our providential rescue to do with altering your feelings toward me?",
  "56853": "Where is it now, the glory and the dream?",
  "56854": "When is one pleasure twice as great as another?",
  "56855": "Is marriage so demoralising as that?",
  "56856": "Did he take any luggage?",
  "56857": "Seeing the old man?",
  "56858": "But there were three races, were there not?",
  "56859": "Was it the effect of the balmy climate alone which recalled him to health?",
  "56860": "Is it paid for?",
  "56861": "Were you speaking of me?",
  "56862": "An emancipator?",
  "56863": "These are the orders, are they?",
  "56864": "Does SHE look like the mother of six?",
  "56865": "Who is the agent?",
  "56866": "What tilbury?",
  "56867": "How can we ever thank you?",
  "56868": "Is it probable?",
  "56869": "Kitchens?",
  "56870": "And then should not the charity be all the more profound, in proportion as the fall is great?",
  "56871": "How was he to get through his present difficulty?",
  "56872": "What have you to say?",
  "56873": "You know?",
  "56874": "Is there any place at liberty that you know of now, uncle, that I should do for?",
  "56875": "But, why should I conceal my sentiments?",
  "56876": "Whom do you mean by THEY?",
  "56877": "Their graces?",
  "56878": "Shall I call him?",
  "56879": "How and why could it be mistaken?",
  "56880": "What the devil do you mean by this?",
  "56881": "If a man in selecting a residence, do not fix on one where such prevail, how can he be wise?",
  "56882": "Well, mon cher, have you got the manifesto?",
  "56883": "How, you are going soon?",
  "56884": "So saying, he fixed his eyes upon me, and asked if I had seen him tremble?",
  "56885": "But the man who was under him?",
  "56886": "Did he still cherish hope?",
  "56887": "Why funny?",
  "56888": "What have I done?",
  "56889": "Do you know much of him?",
  "56890": "Are you quite ready, gentlemen?",
  "56891": "To get what's left me sold by auction?",
  "56892": "What is to be done in these circumstances?",
  "56893": "Could he be sure that he was not their accomplice?",
  "56894": "Did the people shout at all?",
  "56895": "Excuse me,' and you believe that is sufficient?",
  "56896": "I daresay you've heard of her?",
  "56897": "Perhaps you'd care to come in and have a drink on your way?",
  "56898": "Must I receive it, or leave it in the hands of the notary?",
  "56899": "What is the meaning of that?",
  "56900": "Oh, you know him?",
  "56901": "Sir, have you finished supper?",
  "56902": "What did I get by that?",

  "57301": "Nay, none?",
  "57302": "Where does the window of that look out to?",
  "57303": "And sack my stable?",
  "57304": "Like what, sir, eh?",
  "57305": "Could she still draw back after all he had done for her?",

  "57687": "Perhaps you never before noticed him?",
  "57688": "Why is it, I say, that you are thus agitated in relation to the domestic affairs of other communities?",
  "57689": "How can you talk so?",
  "57690": "Who told you that they have never done so?",
  "57691": "Have you got a sledge?",
  "57692": "Police, sir?",
  "57693": "But come whither?",
  "57694": "Then I have received a merely legitimate salary, in spite of the opinion of my confessor?",
  "57695": "But where was the novelty?",
  "57696": "Where is your wife, in the first place?",
  "57697": "And where did the dream come from?",
  "57698": "And what shall I do if you desert me?",
  "57699": "How, nowhere?",
  "57700": "Do you know what we are eating here?",
  "57701": "Yes, but how much?",
  "57702": "Grow pale, fear, calculate?",
  "57703": "Go on the stage?",
  "57704": "Wood?",
  "57705": "What are my heart's experiences?",
  "57706": "What is the ego?",
  "57707": "And how much did she give you for this fine enterprise?",
  "57708": "Was there no means of calming this angry sea?",
  "57709": "What did he say to that?",
  "57710": "Do about you?",
  "57711": "What's the sense of it?",
  "57712": "Where is the guilty party here?",
  "57713": "And what happened to him afterwards?",
  "57714": "Is it a duty to postpone everything to a sense of injuries, and wrong to gratify a mother in a request like this?",
  "57715": "What will you do?",
  "57716": "Anything else, my lord?",
  "57717": "Dear mother, are you so resolved?",
  "57718": "But she is proud, is she not?",
  "57719": "But what does the thermometer say?",
  "57720": "Can you ask that question?",
  "57721": "What's become of them, the dear fellows?",
  "57722": "Why are you travelling?",
  "57723": "How should they use it?",
  "57724": "Does he speak to you of this conspiracy?",
  "57725": "And was SHE married?",
  "57726": "You left your door open?",
  "57727": "Is there danger of another?",
  "57728": "What had her infancy been?",
  "57729": "How much money have you left?",
  "57730": "What is the matter?",
  "57731": "But what were you going to say?",
  "57732": "She is no relation of his?",
  "57733": "What hard fortune brought us here?",
  "57734": "What if she were so called?",
  "57735": "In other words, should strict impartiality be aimed at?",
  "57736": "And what did he offer?",
  "57737": "Why not go and try to get speech of him and beg for justice?",
  "57738": "What shall you do in life?",
  "57739": "Was not that nearly what you said?",
  "57740": "Is not this a free country?",
  "57741": "Which of these will be mine?",
  "57742": "How did you happen to be taken to a hospital?",
  "57743": "What is it?",
  "57744": "I brought it to the table near the fire, and asked him what he would have?",
  "57745": "Do you remember what you told me once, about her making all the apple parsties and doing all the cooking?",
  "57746": "Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind?",
  "57747": "Does this prove that ignorance and dependence domesticate them?",
  "57748": "Why do you not see this?",
  "57749": "What is it makes the wolves to leave the woods?",
  "57750": "It is useless?",
  "57751": "Mad, is he?",
  "57752": "Is it a pure a priori, or is it an empirical intuition?",
  "57753": "Why does it not encourage its citizens to put out its faults, and do better than it would have them?",
  "57754": "Have you told them where to find me?",
  "57755": "Where, then, is the ship?",
  "57756": "I'm not very exacting, am I?",
  "57757": "And in what state of mind has he returned to you?",
  "57758": "What was it that he did?",
  "57759": "Well, then, tell us frankly, what do you think of her personal appearance?",
  "57760": "Why, for example, should the king of a primitive community be prohibited from sleeping lying down?",
  "57761": "Where am I to join on?",
  "57762": "What right have you to bid me leave this house, sir?",
  "57763": "Who would endure this for many lives?",
  "57764": "Which is best off?",
  "57765": "Tell me, where is the place that men call hell?",
  "57766": "Then will she die too?",
  "57767": "Need it be said that no such measures could destroy that tendency?",
  "57768": "Well as he knew how to resolve characters into their elements, would he have been able to combine those elements in such a manner as to make up a man, a real, living, individual man?",
  "57769": "Od's precious, come away, man, what do you mean?",
  "57770": "May I go and help carry the things to the poor little children?",
  "57771": "Have heard them say that there is nothing pleasanter than to get rid of their pain?",
  "57772": "Who could see?",
  "57773": "Have you any more to stake?",
  "57774": "What shall you tell her?",
  "57775": "What like is he?",
  "57776": "Is this of envy or no?",
  "57777": "Why, WHY do they torment me and say I am going to marry you?",
  "57778": "If I went to sleep as I proposed, how could the atmosphere in the chamber be regenerated in the interim?",
  "57779": "I suppose you have searched her desk and things?",
  "57780": "What, after all, was this new oath?",
  "57781": "What then are we to conclude from these facts and considerations?",
  "57782": "How might it fare more gently with you in all the world?",
  "57783": "What avarice?",
  "57784": "Hurt me?",
  "57785": "Are you acquainted with the mood of mind in which, if you were seated alone, and the cat licking its kitten on the rug before you, you would watch the operation so intently that puss's neglect of one ear would put you seriously out of temper?",
  "57786": "Who's not playing fair?",
  "57787": "They were none of them among our friends at the lodge, then?",
  "57788": "Has it been so kept?",
  "57789": "So you are going away in the fall?",
  "57790": "In the flesh?",
  "57791": "Where is my wife?",
  "57792": "And had he married the valiant matron's daughter, as he promised?",
  "57793": "Whatcher take me for, hey?",
  "57794": "What do you mean, the rabbit?",
  "57795": "Now what do you say?",
  "57796": "And what sort of men do they graduate?",
  "57797": "He knew then?",
  "57798": "What was she insolent about?",
  "57799": "Do you not see his heart is fast breaking?",
  "57800": "Can this be possible, uncle?",
  "57801": "Why should they?",
  "57802": "Have you forgotten the day?",
  "57803": "Do you see anything there?",
  "57804": "What is the object of this assembly?",
  "57805": "Good heavens, are you ill?",
  "57806": "Well, did you dig up the watch?",
  "57807": "You will arrest him?",
  "57808": "What uncanny secret did it hold?",
  "57809": "Why is she thus possessed, and why does she not spare herself?",
  "57810": "At any rate, you have some walks in the neighbourhood?",
  "57811": "You have been a soldier?",
  "57812": "But why a year?",
  "57813": "Who's that laughing at me?",
  "57814": "Where, then, would have been her navy, her trade and even her existence?",
  "57815": "What do you hear from your mother?",
  "57816": "How could I settle the point forever?",
  "57817": "What does that spell?",
  "57818": "He means to marry you?",
  "57819": "But would that be necessary?",
  "57820": "What did happen?",
  "57821": "Is the shepherd said to be just to his sheep and his dogs?",
  "57822": "Why do you keep the secrets of that man, when they mean death to so many?",
  "57823": "But if I pursue and nothing gain, what will it profit me to come up with him?",
  "57824": "Do you wish to get out?",
  "57825": "Clara, are you ready to come home?",
  "57826": "Did you ever hear of such ingratitude?",
  "57827": "The best school?",
  "57828": "Bread?",
  "57829": "Dare they to hope a poet for their friend?",
  "57830": "What do I deduce from this?",
  "57831": "When did that person come here, waiter?",
  "57832": "What has made you so disobedient and unfaithful?",
  "57833": "You're not in bed?",
  "57834": "What spot?",
  "57835": "What would become of this assertion, if, assuming in my turn the offensive, I should demonstrate that belief in the existence of bodies, or, in other words, in the reality of a purely corporeal nature, is untenable?",
  "57836": "Did he believe?",
  "57837": "And now, is this all you have to tell me?",
  "57838": "Could he forego the renown of being the first wit of his age?",
  "57839": "What was he hoping for?",
  "57840": "What name am I to say?",
  "57841": "Elm or fir, both of which abounded in the island?",
  "57842": "And why will they not?",
  "57843": "A new one?",
  "57844": "What if you should die first?",
  "57845": "As day by day the sun sank lower and lower in the sky, could he be certain that the luminary would ever retrace his heavenly road?",
  "57846": "Had they nothing else to say to one another?",
  "57847": "Who told you to steal?",
  "57848": "Did I not tell you how quick and resolute she was?",
  "57849": "Is there any example of an individual object that escaped the government of that law in the whole history of the world?",
  "57850": "Why tarry ye?",
  "57851": "Did he give a reason?",
  "57852": "How did you come here?",
  "57853": "Did I break through one of your rings, that you spread that damned ice on the causeway?",
  "57854": "He asked himself, or were they playing a part?",
  "57855": "Is it true that my mind is only a harmony, and my soul a vortex?",
  "57856": "But if I do fight, you will surely not object to giving me a lesson or two in shooting and fencing?",
  "57857": "Are we women?",
  "57858": "Have you more to say?",
  "57859": "What had really happened?",
  "57860": "For what is there more prompt, more unexpected, more abbreviatory of space and time, than the maturity of an obligation?",
  "57861": "Would they be right in the future?",
  "57862": "And what do you say is your surmise as to your present position?",
  "57863": "Suppose now I ask, why I rather than anybody else?",
  "57864": "If what?",
  "57865": "Have you a heart?",
  "57866": "With me?",
  "57867": "Did you ever hear of such an idea?",
  "57868": "Have you quite forgotten her?",
  "57869": "So you are good enough to pass my appearance?",
  "57870": "Is it tobacco?",
  "57871": "I ask you what can I do?",
  "57872": "Could it have been an early hornet?",
  "57873": "Who is that?",
  "57874": "Can you drink anything?",
  "57875": "Why not pursue an end confessedly good by peaceable and regular means?",
  "57876": "Did he come to arrest me?",
  "57877": "Whither so fast, child?",
  "57878": "Ah, why will you not unseal my lips?",
  "57879": "Does this look like confidence?",
  "57880": "Has it gone well?",
  "57881": "Admires the jay the insect's gilded wings?",
  "57882": "And did they often get a chance to do that?",
  "57883": "And do I love?",
  "57884": "UNDER THE CROSS,' hey?",
  "57885": "What did you look at, so fixedly?",
  "57886": "Why stop?",
  "57887": "And of what are you so sure?",
  "57888": "And the friend he regards and describes as one in whom he has an interest, and the other as a stranger in whom he has no interest?",
  "57889": "For all that, are not our dresses as beautiful as yours?",
  "57890": "Why are they fighting?",
  "57891": "Is the danger you apprehended last night gone by now, sir?",
  "57892": "When the winds blow and the seas flow?",
  "57893": "Do you call this acting the part of a man and a gentleman, sir?",
  "57894": "Why should not I eat birds?",
  "57895": "A slap in the face?",
  "57896": "What have you to do with our independence?",
  "57897": "Are you sure you can get 'em out of their fix?",
  "57898": "What principle directed it?",
  "57899": "Besides, why should I say anything about it to him?",
  "57900": "How did you get this passport?",
  "57901": "The house is sold, then?",
  "57902": "What kind of person is she?",
  "57903": "Did he hear me?",
  "57904": "You were his constant companion, then?",
  "57905": "Is it not rather an appeal to the proprietory instinct, the COMMERCIAL instinct?",
  "57906": "Is that true, mother?",
  "57907": "How once?",
  "57908": "When an establishment has had the leisure to develop itself, enlarge its foundations, ballast itself with capital, and assure itself a body of patrons, what can the workman who has only his arms do against a power so superior?",
  "57909": "Well, and what does it signify whether it was he or I?",
  "57910": "What formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward?",
  "57911": "Would it be believed, that when near nineteen, any one could be so stupid as to build his hopes of future subsistence on an empty phial?",
  "57912": "For what?",
  "57913": "Is not this absurd?",
  "57914": "Do you know that I am to be beheaded outside this window?",
  "57915": "Eh, who's there?",
  "57916": "How many a year, did you say?",
  "57917": "You intend to show off your intelligence, I suppose?",
  "57918": "Did you want me?",
  "57919": "What are you talking about, man?",
  "57920": "Is it possible that even now, when I give you these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?",
  "57921": "But where were you going, when you met us?",
  "57922": "D'Artagnan?",
  "57923": "I wonder where I shall be this time tomorrow?",
  "57924": "Taenarum?",
  "57925": "Cannot you understand that the time it takes to wink is a whole eternity if it severs me from the beauty of your face?",
  "57926": "Tomorrow, then, sire?",
  "57927": "And who are you?",
  "57928": "What did ye?",
  "57929": "Did you put out the lamp?",
  "57930": "How long would it last?",
  "57931": "Who is still to come?",
  "57932": "Should he abandon this man?",
  "57933": "How about the others?",
  "57934": "Has he brought his brig with him?",
  "57935": "And what are my instructions?",
  "57936": "To make that reply and then perish, what could be grander?",
  "57937": "Why do I?",
  "57938": "Where are we living?",
  "57939": "Would you like me to come with you now?",
  "57940": "Can you already understand?",
  "57941": "Were they in the front or in the rear of their generation?",
  "57942": "How could I be otherwise?",
  "57943": "On the contrary, but what dignity?",
  "57944": "Just now, but refrained out of politeness ?",
  "57945": "Are you trying to hide?",
  "57946": "Is the vicar in?",
  "57947": "How can you say such a thing?",
  "57948": "A secret?",
  "57949": "Did you want the carpenter, sir?",
  "57950": "Then why are you always alone in your room these days?",
  "57951": "Got shot?",
  "57952": "Who makes the waters flow?",
  "57953": "More money, I suppose?",
  "57954": "About you?",
  "57955": "You will be staying on here, I suppose?",
  "57956": "It is you who set out seven or eight months ago from your country to seek your fortune in the capital?",
  "57957": "Where's your uncle?",
  "57958": "Who in the world cares for YOU?",
  "57959": "Was it real, or only apparent?",
  "57960": "What is the difficulty?",
  "57961": "WHAT doth all the world know at present?",
  "57962": "Is there no ford?",
  "57963": "How came it to pass?",
  "57964": "Are you willing?",
  "57965": "Done with their buttons?",
  "57966": "Av you anything to say agen it?",
  "57967": "Could it have been a slight quivering of the nostrils that he had seen, or was it mad fancy playing a trick on him?",
  "57968": "Would it comfort, or would it wound you to have a similar painting?",
  "57969": "Who is in command here?",
  "57970": "Will you let me see you home?",
  "57971": "Will you take charge of the letter?",
  "57972": "Should not all that be eternal?",
  "57973": "But why prove that to me?",
  "57974": "And its aim is?",
  "57975": "What could be the meaning of such a change?",
  "57976": "Have there been any fresh developments?",
  "57977": "What are you about?",
  "57978": "I am to live at home?",
  "57979": "What joy would they have to bring hanging to the likes of me?",
  "57980": "Where did she go?",
  "57981": "But may I, mamma?",
  "57982": "And who are hearsed that die on the sea?",
  "57983": "How have you got here?",
  "57984": "How long has he left it?",
  "57985": "And whither am I to go?",
  "57986": "Now, from whom could these pages come?",
  "57987": "You will then be at my service?",
  "57988": "And pray, sir, what in the world is equal to it?",
  "57989": "Could it be that there should be happiness in store for her?",
  "57990": "And what would that be, think you?",
  "57991": "In whose name do you come?",
  "57992": "Why not have let me speak to you, above there, where it is light, and there is something stirring, instead of bringing us to this dark and dismal hole?",
  "57993": "Where is my hat?",
  "57994": "But we'll gie 'em another song?",
  "57995": "Yet could I, in justice, or even in possibility, refuse this demand?",
  "57996": "What is the meaning of this?",
  "57997": "Will your majesty permit me to tell you the truth?",
  "57998": "Whatever can be the matter?",
  "57999": "Had the cooling of the globe produced it?",
  "58000": "Are you and your party ready?",
  "58001": "Doubt?",
  "58002": "How d'you do?",
  "58003": "To whom do I surrender?",
  "58004": "Why, where have you seen her?",
  "58005": "Where have you hid him?",
  "58006": "Well, are you off to the front?",
  "58007": "Oh, is that so?",
  "58008": "Why should we give it?",
  "58009": "He asked me if I felt sure that I was as well as in the morning?",
  "58010": "Please will your grandfather lend us his fuelhouse to try over our parts in, tonight at seven o'clock?",
  "58011": "Well, what is it perplexes me?",
  "58012": "Is your honour mad?",
  "58013": "This dial with movable needle is a manometer, is it not?",
  "58014": "How could these men, who never had the faintest idea of statistics, valuation, or political economy, furnish us with principles of legislation?",
  "58015": "And how's it you're not afraid, sir, really now?",
  "58016": "This?",
  "58017": "Are you going to walk out with us after lunch?",
  "58018": "Have you been in it since your adventure?",
  "58019": "Wife with you?",
  "58020": "Why do you keep looking at me like that?",
  "58021": "Did he reject her eternally, or did he not?",
  "58022": "Will you not honor us by telling us who you are?",
  "58023": "Whom have you come from?",
  "58024": "Have you noticed these flowers?",
  "58025": "How much brandy may I drink?",
  "58026": "But what does it matter, now it's all over?",
  "58027": "Who will bring up my children?",
  "58028": "But why should we wish to escape?",
  "58029": "Tell her?",
  "58030": "Has he no father or mother, or uncles or aunts?",
  "58031": "Interested, are you?",
  "58032": "If I'm as good as good can be all day tomorrow will you let me be just as bad as I like all the next day?",
  "58033": "For the father's?",
  "58034": "You're not turning your head to look after more moths, are you?",
  "58035": "And what more do you see?",
  "58036": "Do you answer me with a few regiments?",
  "58037": "Must the young men not look at the young women?",
  "58038": "Was it as she was about to take the veil that they had cast thither that love dowry as a pledge to the world of the living?",
  "58039": "Tell him what?",
  "58040": "Why had he done this?",
  "58041": "Had he seen his father?",
  "58042": "Whom do you bring?",
  "58043": "What does it matter about the trumpery cheque?",
  "58044": "But how could I live up to it?",
  "58045": "But when I assure you that you may rely on my tenderness?",
  "58046": "And what would be the use if she were?",
  "58047": "Have there, indeed, now?",
  "58048": "For whom are you looking, my fine fellow?",
  "58049": "Why did men come to that once forbidding land ?",
  "58050": "What are you thinking of this evening?",
  "58051": "And do you now intend, on this account, to deny the debt?",
  "58052": "Are fathers unnatural, and children prodigal?",
  "58053": "Where shall I find a refuge?",
  "58054": "Who would live amidst perpetual wrangling, and scolding, and mutual reproaches?",
  "58055": "Why do you ask?",
  "58056": "Say?",
  "58057": "For how can the tears of my neighbour benefit me?",
  "58058": "Oh, where are you going, my lord?",
  "58059": "The officer of the guard, then, with his chessboard?",
  "58060": "Is it not then reasonable to infer that, if he had really been guilty of forming a base conspiracy against the fame and fortunes of a rival, he would have expressed some remorse for so serious a crime?",
  "58061": "Do you think the experiment will work?",
  "58062": "What is wrong?",
  "58063": "And can you send me to the station this afternoon?",
  "58064": "Nor him?",
  "58065": "And have these pets got anything on THEIR minds, eh?",
  "58066": "Had you any emeralds?",
  "58067": "And are you going?",
  "58068": "At what o'clock was it raised?",
  "58069": "All of them?",
  "58070": "Do you remember this?",
  "58071": "In the house?",
  "58072": "I say, what's the matter?",
  "58073": "Shall I go and dance before these demons and let them see what a human being can do?",
  "58074": "Why have men of superior endowments submitted to such degradation?",
  "58075": "You, a detective?",
  "58076": "Yes, but they are a long way off, those isles, are they not?",
  "58077": "Then after all my dreams, after all my patience, you do not love me at last?",
  "58078": "Now which are you going to marry?",
  "58079": "And how is your friend?",
  "58080": "Who forces you to do so?",

  "58866": "Well, and when they went at last, those people?",
  "58867": "Well, my pretty one, well, how do things go with you now?",
  "58868": "Like it?",
  "58869": "How do you amuse yourself?",
  "58870": "Is it of him that this man speaks?",

  "58873": "No ladies here?",
  "58874": "The means of breathing zeal, economy, penetration into these irremovable officers who have nothing to gain or to lose?",
  "58875": "Was this where the loveliest face of ages wept?",
  "58876": "And wherefore did I marry but to make lawful prize of a rich widow's wealth, and squander it on love and you?",
  "58877": "Why do you lie to me?",
  "58878": "Would that be well for them?",
  "58879": "Did ever man, in a case of conscience, have a greater responsibility?",
  "58880": "Who put it in them?",

  "58945": "Your host?",
  "58946": "So your son was gone at least two hours?",
  "58947": "Oh, my wife, must I read it?",
  "58948": "Was I afraid of finding a bottomless abyss of empty selfishness?",

  "59666": "How did he acquire these rich assets?",
  "59667": "Why, what do you mean?",
  "59668": "Keeping his place of retirement very close, that he may not be visited too often by affectionate grandsons and their devoted friends, eh?",
  "59669": "What his pursuits, his talents, and genius?",
  "59670": "And are they good?",
  "59671": "On what occasion?",
  "59672": "You see the mounds?",

  "59958": "What would you have?",
  "59959": "Revels?",
  "59960": "Now will you believe I'm in earnest?",
  "59961": "Is the sun up?",
  "59962": "Oh, what's that?",
  "59963": "Is it the immediate object of this confidence, that you may at once ascertain that, with my knowledge?",

  "59965": "Then had I not best send him about his business?",
  "59966": "What does it matter?",
  "59967": "Shall we invite him into our hearts?",
  "59968": "What have you done with her, then, if you have her no longer?",
  "59969": "Then you'll not be wanting me any more tonight, ma'am?",
  "59970": "Jane, do you hear that nightingale singing in the wood?",
  "59971": "Where could they be going?",
  "59972": "Not in regular government pay and employment, to lay traps?",
  "59973": "But who could affirm, who would dare to say, that the amiable fellow did not really see that which his two companions would not see?",

  "59975": "Where are the nearest?",
  "59976": "How has he drawn you to himself?",
  "59977": "Not even of sending me a scrap of stuff for a new dress?",
  "59978": "If he cuts off one of his own toes, or one of his assistants', would you be very much astonished?",
  "59979": "Was the weather hot or cold?",
  "59980": "Where was my baggage?",
  "59981": "Authority?",
  "59982": "Tell him or not tell him?",
  "59983": "O you will let me hold your brave hand, stranger?",
  "59984": "You think so, my lord?",
  "59985": "In your left ear?",
  "59986": "Who shall live up to the great trust?",

  "59994": "What good does it do?",
  "59995": "You have never heard her nephew play?",
  "59996": "What sin, mademoiselle?",
  "59997": "Or that it is impossible to draw more than one right line betwixt any two points?",
