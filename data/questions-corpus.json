  "1332": "Will you speak?",
  "1333": "What danger do you foresee?",
  "1334": "But you still think the lode does come through into our house?",
  "1335": "But what could be done now?",
  "1336": "They didn't tease her to death, did they?",

  "1346": "She'd be so scandalised?",
  "1347": "And suppose that I refuse to go with you?",
  "1348": "You won't tell?",
  "1349": "Of me?",
  "1350": "For the state you've let yourself get into?",

  "1360": "And why had he not done so?",
  "1361": "I hope there's no bad news in that telegram?",
  "1362": "Who goes?",
  "1363": "What have you done to it?",
  "1364": "Is a new world coming?",
  "1365": "And you will always love him?",
  "1366": "Hold your tongue, can't ye?",
  "1367": "Is it not the desire of seeing a husband again from whom you have been separated for a week?",
  "1368": "Nevvy?",
  "1369": "Are you doing nothing for them?",
  "1370": "How much did the other mug get?",
  "1371": "You going to have all the girls and boys?",
  "1372": "No offence, I hope, brother?",

  "1380": "Well, I suppose you'll want a dish o' tay, or victuals of some sort, hey?",
  "1381": "Why speak you not?",
  "1382": "Some of the country people?",
  "1383": "Do you know, sir, that your mucous membranes are in a state of high irritation, apparent by the papillce at the tip of your tongue?",
  "1384": "There was the door that would lead me within the prison, but where was the means to open it?",
  "1385": "Are there not moments when one grows sick of grinning and tumbling, and the jingling of cap and bells?",
  "1386": "What was that, monsieur?",
  "1387": "A brave lodging for such as we, is it not so?",
  "1388": "How the devil did it get into my boots?",
  "1389": "Think they'll see us?",
  "1390": "Gave it away?",
  "1391": "Whence come the highest mountains?",

  "1431": "What's that you say, eh?",
  "1432": "O the poesie, the poesie?",
  "1433": "But this house is so strong, how can I open it?",
  "1434": "Guy, what is my name?",
  "1435": "But how tell an undefinable uneasiness, variable as the clouds, unstable as the winds?",
  "1436": "No, that did not suit me, but what was I to do?",
  "1437": "But do you think they are better for having it quickened, stimulated?",
  "1438": "Why did you write anonymously to worry so noble and generous a lady?",
  "1439": "Was it permitted to believe that there was nowhere upon the earth, or above the earth, a heaven for hogs, where they were requited for all this suffering?",
  "1440": "If he were not dead, where would his vengeance stop?",
  "1441": "You've seen a private car some time in your life?",
  "1442": "Which boulevard?",
  "1443": "How is he now?",
  "1444": "Who could have suggested to him such an act as this?",

  "1446": "Do you hear him?",
  "1447": "You're not going to be jealous, are you?",
  "1448": "And why so, when WE were not expected till night?",
  "1449": "But why has he waited till now?",
  "1450": "Are you blind, deaf, senseless, dead?",
  "1451": "What was their destination?",
  "1452": "Can it be there's no chance of it?",
  "1453": "The poor fellow had got the attorney to promise secrecy, but what of that?",
  "1454": "I wonder where are they, those good fellows?",

  "1458": "Did I wake or sleep?",
  "1459": "Are we going to take him as a servant?",
  "1460": "Why so fierce?",
  "1461": "For what is it we call a man of birth, but one who is descended from a long succession of rich and powerful ancestors, and who acquires our esteem by his relation to persons whom we esteem?",
  "1462": "Would you mind telling me, so that I can see whether you are not mistaken?",
  "1463": "How are your brains?",
  "1464": "Wot do they understand?",
  "1465": "Could any government do more to train the people in the way in which he would have them go?",
  "1466": "You won't give him up?",
  "1467": "After all, what good was this?",
  "1468": "You mean perhaps to be a painter?",
  "1469": "For whom was the first appointment?",
  "1470": "Well, what should I have done?",
  "1471": "Where's my considering cap?",
  "1472": "Don't you understand, your excellency, my dear sir, that you must not defile through narrow village streets when we are marching against the enemy?",
  "1473": "How did you come by this letter?",
  "1474": "One or other?",
  "1475": "Would he arouse him with a throb of agony?",
  "1476": "But, really, for mercy's sake, prince, what have I done?",
  "1477": "Has anything happened?",
  "1478": "Come up on the tramp?",
  "1479": "What was he doing on the tower?",
  "1480": "What did they contain of pleasure, of happiness, or of grief?",
  "1481": "What do you mean, cousin?",
  "1482": "But then, when you wish to embark, you are obliged to come to the surface of the water?",
  "1483": "What has he in his arms?",
  "1484": "For what now was the first thing you were taught?",
  "1485": "Shall we yield ourselves to him?",
  "1486": "Will you enter, and see my wife?",
  "1487": "Could it then be possible?",
  "1488": "What are these imperious sympathies?",
  "1489": "Could this, too, be a wig?",
  "1490": "Do you consider it an accidental case, prince?",
  "1491": "Will you add these twenty francs to the seven you have?",
  "1492": "And you failed?",
  "1493": "Then you know nothing of the city?",
  "1494": "Was that wise?",
  "1495": "They had a youth with them?",
  "1496": "Were they intelligent mechanisms?",
  "1497": "Are you in a place?",
  "1498": "Warn her?",
  "1499": "Shall we have it up here, or go down to the restaurant?",
  "1500": "And you say that one of your friends lives in that house?",
  "1501": "What does he send me?",
  "1502": "He was only talking to himself, saying 'Over, is it?",
  "1503": "And would not the deficiencies of one year be made up for by the surplus of another?",
  "1504": "I understood, of course, that he saw something, but what?",
  "1505": "You understan', do you?",
  "1506": "Where did you find so many diamonds?",
  "1507": "But tell me, senor, what do you call this excellent and rare adventure that has left us as we are left now?",
  "1508": "Why should you get into such a tantrum about nothing?",
  "1509": "Are you not nearly spent with the heat?",
  "1510": "Do you think you are where you used to be?",
  "1511": "Then the eleventh day must have been a holiday?",
  "1512": "But what can you expect of a creature from the deanery?",
  "1513": "The children?",
  "1514": "You are, doubtless, acquainted with a variety of languages, so as to have been able to read all these?",
  "1515": "What makes you think that?",
  "1516": "You mean his idea for his native place?",
  "1517": "Why then are we to believe the same thing of another girl whom we never saw, told by nobody knows who, nor when, nor where?",
  "1518": "Were they going to let him alone this time?",
  "1519": "Had you commissioned me?",
  "1520": "And you remember that we came up with the two in a ditch, and that there was a scuffle between them, and that one of them had been severely handled and much mauled about the face by the other?",
  "1521": "What has the change been?",
  "1522": "I say, won't you come to the studio and have a talk?",
  "1523": "And where is the next point?",
  "1524": "It is not such a very dreadful circumstance that we are odd people, is it?",
  "1525": "What says my nephew?",
  "1526": "Who's firing?",
  "1527": "Mamma, are you cross?",
  "1528": "Perhaps you think the poor might have their part?",
  "1529": "Then I am to blow my brains out?",
  "1530": "What is it then, for goodness' sake?",
  "1531": "Poison him?",
  "1532": "And do you hear?",
  "1533": "Why didn't you come and wake me?",
  "1534": "What shall we do?",
  "1535": "Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?",
  "1536": "What's this paper?",
  "1537": "Then it was to go to her that you left us?",
  "1538": "Are we not endowed with inner force to fight successfully against obstacles and difficulties, and to wrest trophies of glory from hardships?",
  "1539": "Then I am condemned, sire?",
  "1540": "Could he be trying to measure the thickness of the crust of the earth that lay between us and the world above?",
  "1541": "What do you mean to do about this you have seen?",
  "1542": "But your old friends of the musketeers?",
  "1543": "How to get rid of him?",
  "1544": "Each time there had been no sentence of importance which she could relate, and as for the glances and sensations, what woman would reveal them?",
  "1545": "Go and call upon this girl?",
  "1546": "Till he yield to me?",
  "1547": "You're back from leave, I suppose?",
  "1548": "Where are the papers of this prisoner?",
  "1549": "I say, friends, have you heard?",
  "1550": "Well, I said, and how does the change from oligarchy into democracy arise?",
  "1551": "Will you let them come?",
  "1552": "Wot d'ye mean?",
  "1553": "I mean that are not there now?",
  "1554": "Why have they not got rid of him?",
  "1555": "And will you tell me what a gentleman is?",
  "1556": "Were you in love with him?",
  "1557": "Does a woman ever know how much such speeches cost?",
  "1558": "How is this seeming miracle accomplished?",
  "1559": "Do you not humble me if you are too proud to accept what is due to you from my brother?",
  "1560": "Did you have a nice walk?",
  "1561": "Whence came it?",
  "1562": "Would it not be more like a man to go before his face, and take the satisfaction of a warrior?",
  "1563": "How much does the hire amount to since yesterday?",
  "1564": "Have you heard the password?",
  "1565": "But where are the huts?",
  "1566": "Why should all the parts and organs of many independent beings, each supposed to have been separately created for its proper place in nature, be so invariably linked together by graduated steps?",
  "1567": "What would be the use?",
  "1568": "But how did she become so?",
  "1569": "As before?",
  "1570": "But can the crude fruit of casual observation, never brought to the test of judgment, formed by comparing speculation and experience, deserve such a distinction?",
  "1571": "But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge?",
  "1572": "How can it be foreign?",
  "1573": "Which of your uncles do you like best?",
  "1574": "And what is it to be?",
  "1575": "That we may find it necessary to punish the injury you have done to us?",
  "1576": "Ex tempore?",
  "1577": "Their father is dead?",
  "1578": "Or what is gone with my lords your brethren?",
  "1579": "Well, then, how about the land?",
  "1580": "What business have you at all with these interviews?",
  "1581": "How long was she there?",
  "1582": "A whole bottle?",
  "1583": "Moved?",
  "1584": "Is he not a man of honour and feeling?",
  "1585": "For if we fail in this our fight he must surely win, and then where end we?",
  "1586": "The great question certainly was, what?",
  "1587": "He supposed he was right?",
  "1588": "Is nothing due to the man whom we have all such reason to love, and no reason in the world to think ill of?",
  "1589": "But when you are not sure whether it is a fact or not, what are you to do?",
  "1590": "Would you like to see 'em?",
  "1591": "Which of the two?",
  "1592": "Has either of them confided anything to you by word of mouth?",
  "1593": "Has he ploughed, sowed, reaped, mowed, winnowed, weeded?",
  "1594": "Opposite the scaffold?",
  "1595": "Has anyone gone for the opossum?",
  "1596": "Apiece?",
  "1597": "Eyes don't trouble you any more, do they?",
  "1598": "Monseigneur assures me that the devil has nothing to do with this?",
  "1599": "Well, is it not noble to defend the poets, and introduce to the public all the new scientific and political ideas?",
  "1600": "Is this just?",
  "1601": "But how can you get there?",
  "1602": "Would you help me?",
  "1603": "What of the race, my pulse?",
  "1604": "What right had they to weep over or to talk about her?",
  "1605": "What's he like, this lad?",
  "1606": "What do you think, can a man be suffocated with a wet cloth?",
  "1607": "Is the loin pork enough?",
  "1608": "Put it straight, will you?",
  "1609": "Are you not, comrade?",
  "1610": "How is that, my child?",
  "1611": "And what after that?",
  "1612": "Do you repent of your sins, and do you acknowledge death as a righteous expiation and punishment?",
  "1613": "Shall I serve my child by a lie?",
  "1614": "Hey, who's there?",
  "1615": "How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments?",
  "1616": "Is not death opposed to life?",
  "1617": "And how much will that pair of stockings be worth when she has finished them?",
  "1618": "Grimaud, why did you not tell me this?",
  "1619": "My superintendent would not find me any money?",
  "1620": "How came it yours?",
  "1621": "Besides, who is to choose the velvet and cut for this young dandy?",
  "1622": "And, I say, don't you think you'd better suggest at the same time that the men should smoke?",
  "1623": "Who wants a protector?",
  "1624": "ARE they memorials?",
  "1625": "Exactly of what else could a platform consist?",
  "1626": "Why are you making knots in that ribbon, and writing invisible characters on the floor with the point of that busy little foot?",
  "1627": "Of my own life?",
  "1628": "What do these sounds portend?",
  "1629": "And who knows it?",
  "1630": "Can you do it?",
  "1631": "Or are you going to keep it right alongside of us outrageous fellows?",
  "1632": "You consider that to be important?",
  "1633": "Should I?",
  "1634": "Has he, ma'am?",
  "1635": "What precaution?",
  "1636": "On his track?",
  "1637": "Was not he disguised?",
  "1638": "And the quilting of the stairs no where worn out, and bare?",
  "1639": "Won't you listen?",
  "1640": "What have you there?",
  "1641": "You go back and watch that long, will you?",
  "1642": "Will they abandon them in misfortune?",
  "1643": "What, then, will you say?",
  "1644": "That don't seem very far out of the way now, do it?",
  "1645": "Why, is it hid all around?",
  "1646": "You think love is the ticket, do you?",
  "1647": "Old or young?",
  "1648": "Has no copy been taken?",
  "1649": "Do you love him, love him with all your heart and soul, with all the love your bosom can feel?",
  "1650": "And how do you feel about it?",
  "1651": "What are fireworks like?",
  "1652": "Whom am I and what am I?",
  "1653": "Oh, why had she sent her letter?",
  "1654": "Do you conceive me, gentlemen?",
  "1655": "To what, ma'am?",
  "1656": "But how much truth was behind it?",
  "1657": "What does it contain?",
  "1658": "Why should it break three inches from the top, as this one has done?",
  "1659": "Was it last evening that you came on board this vessel?",
  "1660": "Well, that wasn't very far, was it?",
  "1661": "And why not a bowl of rack punch as well as any other cause?",
  "1662": "Would it be some young man or other whom she takes an interest in?",
  "1663": "Is it absolutely necessary to go on with the letter, darling?",
  "1664": "Is that a genuine letter you are reading?",
  "1665": "What could be better?",
  "1666": "What has she been telling you?",
  "1667": "Why is that little, and the little freedom they enjoy, to be infringed?",
  "1668": "Had I been remanded to my dungeon, to await the next sacrifice, which would not take place for many months?",
  "1669": "Will she recover?",
  "1670": "And so you like this man's sisters, too, do you?",
  "1671": "Is that what you mean?",
  "1672": "But now that virtue has become to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into bitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy?",
  "1673": "What do you mean by going with other men, anyway?",
  "1674": "Where's the lecture room, d'you know?",
  "1675": "Why didn't you tell me, then?",
  "1676": "What would be the end?",
  "1677": "Feelin' sick?",
  "1678": "Determine on what?",
  "1679": "And yet what?",
  "1680": "Why risk the world's great empire for a punk?",
  "1681": "You mean, spend too much money?",
  "1682": "Shall, then, this bow take the life of many a chief among us, merely because you cannot bend it yourself?",
  "1683": "Nose and all?",
  "1684": "And will you answer it?",
  "1685": "How, then, will competition be harmoniously determined in society?",
  "1686": "Have I got to drink that stuff?",
  "1687": "Ruined her?",
  "1688": "So that I need not make use of this petition?",
  "1689": "But what do you conclude from that, father?",
  "1690": "What took place?",
  "1691": "Will you give your honour not to fire while we talk?",
  "1692": "What's the use of that?",
  "1693": "What's fame?",
  "1694": "Where would be the use of it?",
  "1695": "My purpose, for why should I deny it?",
  "1696": "Do you contradict me?",
  "1697": "What makes you so smitten with that little vermin?",
  "1698": "But how did you get in here?",
  "1699": "He had a son with him, hadn't he?",

  "4965": "Why then has he declined the only thing that was worth while to write upon?",
  "4966": "What is it, and then I will tell you?",
  "4967": "Is it so stupid?",
  "4968": "But tell me, ye men, who of you are capable of friendship?",
  "4969": "Why, what the devil could I say?",

  "4980": "What, are you wounded, my lad?",
  "4981": "Now, what has taken place?",
  "4982": "For completing the work you began so well last night?",
  "4983": "What, does he hate the police too?",
  "4984": "Half knave and half fool, and detected in both characters?",
  "4985": "Glad to know what?",
  "4986": "You don't think that I and my son are other than gentlemen?",
  "4987": "Yesterday morning?",
  "4988": "What is that empty coffin?",
  "4989": "How is it that I am writing to you?",
  "4990": "Do you suppose I don't see the line you've taken up with your wife?",

  "4994": "To famish apart?",
  "4995": "Bevan?",
  "4996": "Do you like fish?",

  "5138": "In what figure shall I give his heart the first impression?",
  "5139": "The inquiry being only into the circumstances touching the death of the deceased, it's not necessary to go beyond these facts, I suppose you'll agree?",
  "5140": "Have you knocked at that one?",
  "5141": "Today, this moment?",
  "5142": "Or had he in reality always been like this, commonplace and prosaic, and was it merely in her imagination that he had been wonderful?",

  "5361": "But may not the tradition of it have descended from the discovery of comparatively late remains, by primitive man, of the winged saurians that crawled, swam, dived, or flew, lingering on till the later geologic period?",
  "5362": "The lady, sir?",
  "5363": "Oats?",
  "5364": "How long could they keep the pace?",
  "5365": "His uncle had deceived him, and might he not consign her to some miserable place where her youth and beauty would prove a far greater curse than ugliness and decrepitude?",
  "5366": "Who do you wish to see?",
  "5367": "How long is this for?",
  "5368": "What conceivable motive had they for doing so?",
  "5369": "Have ye already flown high enough?",
  "5370": "Which way is the business part?",
  "5371": "And dressed?",
  "5372": "Why, cousin?",
  "5373": "Don't you think he would rather have his favourite old pupil near him, than anybody else?",
  "5374": "Make you feel rotten?",
  "5375": "Do I ever take pains to have any secrets?",
  "5376": "Did you ever see her?",
  "5377": "How do you like my entrance?",
  "5378": "Can you rest here?",
  "5379": "Cruel?",
  "5380": "Will you never do anything?",
  "5381": "Beneath it?",
  "5382": "Is such a thing possible?",
  "5383": "Sorry for whom?",
  "5384": "Your leagues concluded, your engagements past?",
  "5385": "Why does he not come himself?",
  "5386": "Is anything the matter?",
  "5387": "But why didn't ye tell me ye was the cook?",
  "5388": "Of what misdemeanor do you accuse him?",
  "5389": "And who did it?",
  "5390": "Only think what you are giving up here?",
  "5391": "He won't tell you, but he told us he was awful surprised himself, didn't he, girls?",
  "5392": "But it is such an interesting subject, isn't it?",
  "5393": "And what would you call her?",
  "5394": "Have you you both got nice pocket handkerchiefs?",
  "5395": "The boy is out, you say?",
  "5396": "Why don't you finish your sentence?",
  "5397": "What can make her amends for this privation, or where is she to seek for a fresh employment?",
  "5398": "But what's the southern army to do?",
  "5399": "What was passing in that brain, so loaded with dreadful secrets?",
  "5400": "Are you sure she said that?",
  "5401": "I do not know whether you have heard the whole story?",
  "5402": "How near were you?",
  "5403": "Surprise?",
  "5404": "And why should you object?",
  "5405": "But what are men?",
  "5406": "But why didn't you tell us at first?",
  "5407": "It that noble?",
  "5408": "Oh, what shall I call you?",
  "5409": "Will you come out with me again one evening?",
  "5410": "Then who is supporting you there?",
  "5411": "What is the difference, then, between the two customs?",
  "5412": "Why don't you have a cat?",
  "5413": "I wonder, captain, what they will say of my going away, ha?",
  "5414": "In such a world as this, what is the use of the enjoyment of pleasures, if he who has fed on them is to return to this world again and again?",
  "5415": "Why did you introduce a defective bill?",
  "5416": "And why then have you tempted me?",
  "5417": "Didn't you know?",
  "5418": "And his name?",
  "5419": "Did he get well?",
  "5420": "Lend me a hanky, will you?",
  "5421": "Would you know how to buy it, my darling?",
  "5422": "When the tongue of an advocate once gets in motion, who can tell where it will stop?",
  "5423": "What was this?",
  "5424": "Is there any enjoyment in it, if his opinion is that he is aggrieved?",
  "5425": "Why d'you read then?",
  "5426": "Was it not the strongest wish of his heart that I should adopt his own career?",
  "5427": "Of what consequence?",
  "5428": "Would you like me to get out the books now that your grandmother is going to give you for your birthday?",
  "5429": "What is it, then?",
  "5430": "Well, how are you?",
  "5431": "You've come back, have you?",
  "5432": "Now, if I grant that they cannot be employed in the sphere of experience, as constitutive principles, how shall I secure for them employment and objective validity as regulative principles, and in what way can they be so employed?",
  "5433": "How long have you had that cough ?",
  "5434": "Would you turn their distress into a malediction?",
  "5435": "Of what did the plebeians complain?",
  "5436": "Giry, do you know what is in this envelope?",
  "5437": "Are you sure of this?",
  "5438": "Or five?",
  "5439": "But how about the wine?",
  "5440": "Must I go in immediately?",
  "5441": "BROWN?",
  "5442": "See, now, my jealous lord, do I address such questions to you?",
  "5443": "Ain't it beautiful?",
  "5444": "Went to wash your face, did yer?",
  "5445": "What are laborers in relation to each other?",

  "5449": "What had he, a family man, to do with ventures beyond sea?",
  "5450": "What will ye with me?",
  "5451": "Will you please tell him that a lady wishes to see him?",
  "5452": "A wa'at for me?",
  "5453": "Whence came beauty so marvellous?",
  "5454": "Hasn't he got away?",
  "5455": "Didn't she send me a message or anything?",
  "5456": "Was there enough ice?",
  "5457": "But where will they lead us to?",
  "5458": "A fright?",
  "5459": "Is it nothing to extinguish the torch that lights up savage warfare?",
  "5460": "How can I help that, my boy?",
  "5461": "Can you have become untrue to your own heart?",
  "5462": "How then, sir, can I act, but by shewing my abhorrence of every step that makes towards my undoing?",
  "5463": "And you will not turn aside as you did just now?",
  "5464": "How is it?",
  "5465": "Said he, what's the matter?",
  "5466": "Why haven't you told him?",
  "5467": "And was it not the manly thing for him to do?",
  "5468": "Was that kind?",
  "5469": "Is ever disaster nearer than when each solider thinks about his private safety only?",
  "5470": "Are you all clear, you, aft there?",
  "5471": "That is perhaps true, but what of it?",
  "5472": "Where may he be at present?",
  "5473": "Menneville, what do you want to do?",
  "5474": "But this coffer?",
  "5475": "The main question is, which of the two parents is more to be had in honour?",
  "5476": "We were too rich, were we?",
  "5477": "Are we not bound to carry our investigations to extremity?",
  "5478": "Can you read?",
  "5479": "What were we the worse for the former folly?",
  "5480": "Could I speak to you alone for a moment?",
  "5481": "Oh, you're the new articled clerk?",
  "5482": "What right thing?",
  "5483": "Stendhal?",
  "5484": "Will you go?",
  "5485": "Why, then, do you fear them?",
  "5486": "O how shall I know this?",
  "5487": "You want to see who they are?",
  "5488": "What stayed them?",
  "5489": "And I've got a tremendous will, have I?",
  "5490": "Wot about it?",
  "5491": "Oh, something in a philanthropic way?",
  "5492": "Oh, but how was it?",
  "5493": "But where are we drifting?",
  "5494": "But what were our managers doing?",
  "5495": "Weren't you?",
  "5496": "You are come to tell us it is time to be gone, have you not?",
  "5497": "Was the man a magician?",

  "5499": "Do you not see what feigned prices, are set upon little stones and rarities?",
  "5500": "What, are there any greater still?",
  "5501": "Is she your cousin?",
  "5502": "What mystery could be hidden under this sign?",
  "5503": "To the cottage of her sister?",
  "5504": "A pipe ?",
  "5505": "Do I delight to die, or life desire?",
  "5506": "Why are you in low spirits?",
  "5507": "If she married and got rid of it, which was the best thing she could do, why don't you give her the benefit of the change?",
  "5508": "And you will leave me then?",
  "5509": "Was it an illusion, a mistake, an optical illusion?",
  "5510": "What principle of good faith, then, was violated?",
  "5511": "Ain't there no water, nor nothing to eat?",
  "5512": "Looking toward our house?",
  "5513": "Will you be quiet, then?",
  "5514": "Who am I?",
  "5515": "You couldn't really expect a person to pray very well the first time she tried, could you?",
  "5516": "Is it for you, who keep an inn, to treat passengers at this rate?",
  "5517": "And did you see him?",
  "5518": "Why don't you walk down?",
  "5519": "Supposing, for instance, that they should suddenly hail a taxi?",
  "5520": "Have you anything interesting there?",
  "5521": "And you found yourselves suddenly on a mountain side?",
  "5522": "Why do you ever come back, then, at all?",
  "5523": "Will that be all?",
  "5524": "You haven't missed anything yourself, have you?",
  "5525": "But what did I want crawling forward to scorch my understanding at her flaming brow?",
  "5526": "But if there were somewhere a being strong and beautiful, a valiant nature, full at once of exaltation and refinement, a poet's heart in an angel's form, a lyre with sounding chords ringing out elegiac epithalamia to heaven, why, perchance, should she not find him?",
  "5527": "You have only lately arrived?",
  "5528": "I shall have the comte's letter in eight hours?",
  "5529": "How can we with mortal eyes contemplate this image, whose celestial splendor the host of heaven presumes not to behold?",
  "5530": "How can it affect them?",
  "5531": "Ever seen one like it?",
  "5532": "How have I done what I have done?",
  "5533": "He's very queer, isn't he?",
  "5534": "Do you see that bath behind you?",
  "5535": "Knight, will you suffer this?",
  "5536": "That which is on high at the summit, at the crest, at the zenith, that which sends down so much light on the earth, sees but little, sees badly, sees not at all?",
  "5537": "What length was it?",
  "5538": "Why isn't she here?",
  "5539": "What are we all miserable for, when everything might be so happy?",
  "5540": "What did he say to me?",
  "5541": "I'm afraid you are ill?",
  "5542": "You are a stoodent, aren't you?",
  "5543": "Why should she have been less prone to love than he was?",
  "5544": "In what time?",
  "5545": "How was it known that these letters were from me?",
  "5546": "Wouldn't you do anything to help another girl?",
  "5547": "Surely I never led you to expect such a thing?",
  "5548": "And is he aware of the danger he has been in?",
  "5549": "But why had his father taken up the board?",
  "5550": "What has become of him?",
  "5551": "And are not your own very lives in my hands?",
  "5552": "But we shall see you soon again, shall we not?",
  "5553": "I missed again?",
  "5554": "Am I boring you with all this?",
  "5555": "Are they, do you think?",
  "5556": "Do you realize that it's all your fault?",
  "5557": "My dear fellow, how are you?",
  "5558": "What does he appear to be?",
  "5559": "What were you doing?",
  "5560": "What is the relative age of this hymn?",
  "5561": "But if your honor knew this man?",
  "5562": "Do you think the lemon juice did any good?",
  "5563": "Am I to believe that?",
  "5564": "But your writing?",
  "5565": "Well, do you hear, sirrah?",
  "5566": "Was it in this room that you gave your instructions as to the copying of the document?",
  "5567": "How comes it that a true and cordial fraternity has not arrested on the one side and on the other the effects of pride and labor?",
  "5568": "What do you mean, sir?",
  "5569": "Do you wish this to live?",
  "5570": "What more can they pretend?",
  "5571": "Has anything escaped me?",
  "5572": "Ever kicked downstairs?",
  "5573": "Is it possible to abolish property in land in our age?",
  "5574": "Now how in the world did it get here?",
  "5575": "And what will you say to him, beloved?",
  "5576": "Then the just is happy, and the unjust miserable?",
  "5577": "I ain't here for harm, young master, I suppose?",
  "5578": "In favour of the temperate men?",
  "5579": "Why not like that?",
  "5580": "Did you not hear me?",
  "5581": "Indeed, how can he, when they but follow his own vile example?",
  "5582": "Now, what must we conclude with respect to such sexual differences as these?",
  "5583": "What boots it singing on?",
  "5584": "Why do you start and look pale at my words?",
  "5585": "Cannot I serve you as a waiting maid?",
  "5586": "Don't you know that you are liable to arrest for this?",
  "5587": "Was it mere fancy?",
  "5588": "Were you not saying that he too makes, not the idea which, according to our view, is the essence of the bed, but only a particular bed?",
  "5589": "Why, what are they thinking upon, sir?",
  "5590": "Shall we go forward?",
  "5591": "I suppose you quite agree with them, prince?",
  "5592": "Am I not right?",
  "5593": "And after the police?",
  "5594": "Why did I say 'Je vous aime'* to her, which was a lie, and worse than a lie?",
  "5595": "Have you a place you would like to put him in?",
  "5596": "Well, then, how am I free?",
  "5597": "A mere drudge?",
  "5598": "And who put the torpedo there?",
  "5599": "This is the triumph I was to have, is it?",
  "5600": "What new conditions?",
  "5601": "Are we wrong?",
  "5602": "How can we help loving and dwelling upon its recollections?",
  "5603": "Do you not know him?",
  "5604": "My good sir, is this man a hero, or a criminal?",
  "5605": "You would not change your lot for that of a king?",
  "5606": "Well, you will not tell us?",
  "5607": "But why in the world shouldn't you see him, dear?",
  "5608": "She could hardly believe as much, but why did he not write?",
  "5609": "If so, state all he said, as nearly as you can?",
  "5610": "A race?",
  "5611": "The question suggests itself, may there not be present, even in blindly impulsive action, something faintly corresponding to desire and will?",
  "5612": "Would you like to see him?",
  "5613": "Or did they interpret our spurts of fire, the sudden stinging of our shells, our steady investment of their encampment, as we should the furious unanimity of onslaught in a disturbed hive of bees?",
  "5614": "And how are you?",
  "5615": "Why send it away?",
  "5616": "What's the hurry?",
  "5617": "How should you know that?",
  "5618": "Very handsome still?",
  "5619": "Would you like to see a little of it?",
  "5620": "May I presume to ask whether you have long possessed it?",
  "5621": "Well, waiving that, as she is nothing to me, and virtuously married to another man, why should she come troubling us?",
  "5622": "And what on earth are you going to do with it?",
  "5623": "Wouldn't you give them a week?",
  "5624": "Why so hard?",
  "5625": "Have they loved me?",
  "5626": "Ah, but you mean here, at your own home?",
  "5627": "How am I to get in?",
  "5628": "Then he who is a good keeper of anything is also a good thief?",
  "5629": "Will you ask him what kind was his son?",
  "5630": "Ey?",
  "5631": "The one in blue?",
  "5632": "Lordy, what did you do?",
  "5633": "So you'll not tell, will you?",
  "5634": "Why did he not bring it to me here?",
  "5635": "Do you mean to say a woman isn't beautiful after she is twenty?",
  "5636": "What is all that noise?",
  "5637": "Has he escaped?",
  "5638": "Have you got him?",
  "5639": "Has he a mother?",
  "5640": "Would he carry him on with him?",
  "5641": "You mean that you think there was no accident?",
  "5642": "Why, dear?",
  "5643": "How badly?",
  "5644": "Why should he not go to the home of his fathers?",
  "5645": "Is that all he does?",
  "5646": "Ah, where in the world have there been greater follies than with the pitiful?",
  "5647": "But what is the latest news of him?",
  "5648": "You know we want some help in the servant staff of the hospital?",
  "5649": "Of money?",
  "5650": "Who will plant the flag on the barricade again?",
  "5651": "Was the fire wholly extinct there?",
  "5652": "Why did you originally go away from me?",
  "5653": "But are not these spirited natures apt to be savage with one another, and with everybody else?",
  "5654": "How did this come about?",
  "5655": "What do I know about arms or supports?",
  "5656": "What does she make a sham for, and pretend to give me money, and take it away again?",
  "5657": "And was this conference arranged beforehand?",
  "5658": "Yet, to show my ingenuity rather than wit, would not a less model have given a full representation of that subject, not by diminution but by contraction of parts?",
  "5659": "Wherefore should I hold, good fellow?",
  "5660": "What have you done with your fur?",
  "5661": "Is not that true?",
  "5662": "And do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to her daughters, than to us?",
  "5663": "But why must I promise that?",
  "5664": "And what do you know?",
  "5665": "Will you have it so, or will you share your lover's punishment?",
  "5666": "How could a readiness for war in time of peace be safely prohibited, unless we could prohibit, in like manner, the preparations and establishments of every hostile nation?",
  "5667": "And why on earth does she want to speak to me at all?",
  "5668": "What did you do it for?",
  "5669": "What can I do to serve you?",
  "5670": "What reason had you to strike the man who won my daughter?",
  "5671": "May it not be defined as a period of about twenty years in a woman's life, and thirty in a man's?",
  "5672": "What good is arguments to me?",
  "5673": "And who escapes his lot?",
  "5674": "How is she looking?",
  "5675": "Why so?",
  "5676": "What did he wish for?",
  "5677": "Would she take it as a joke?",
  "5678": "And is she not effectually degraded?",
  "5679": "Final for couples?",
  "5680": "They must be sold, I suppose?",
  "5681": "But what shall I do?",
  "5682": "Who can tell what a dark, dreary, hopeless life I have dragged on for months past?",
  "5683": "What could be the trouble in that quarter?",
  "5684": "What does it matter, after all?",
  "5685": "What is the result of it?",
  "5686": "Did you hear that cry?",
  "5687": "Oh, don't you see?",
  "5688": "Did you ever see such a large peach in all your life?",
  "5689": "How much are you to give him?",
  "5690": "How many?",
  "5691": "Everything as it used to be?",
  "5692": "And how may that be?",
  "5693": "Are you comfortable?",
  "5694": "Can there be a rational adjustment of the claims of each?",
  "5695": "Father, that money is mine, why should I speak to you about that?",
  "5696": "Surely, sweet, it shall never be our dwelling?",
  "5697": "If he is it's not much good my coming, is it?",
  "5698": "Boys, an't this yer fun?",
  "5699": "Would those stiff trees that had outlived the eagle, turn young and airy pages to him, to skip on his errands when he bade them?",
  "5700": "What is their story?",
  "5701": "At what hour shall we come?",
  "5702": "Have you any tips to give us before we clear out?",
  "5703": "Which is the principal aim of these three?",
  "5704": "Does not the word express more than the fact, and must not the actual, whatever a man may think, always, in the nature of things, fall short of the truth?",
  "5705": "That's to you, I suppose, child?",
  "5706": "How must I arrange it, then?",
  "5707": "Is it really?",
  "5708": "Do you want any assistance?",
  "5709": "Yes, and is there a rope handy?",
  "5710": "Do you think it would be good for you?",
  "5711": "Suppose I handed you over to the police?",
  "5712": "And is the art of war one of those arts in which she can or can not share?",
  "5713": "And when did you arrive here?",
  "5714": "But how did he procure his books?",
  "5715": "You know her only son died eight years ago?",
  "5716": "How far do you purpose to extend your walk?",
  "5717": "At once?",
  "5718": "You do not like it, then?",
  "5719": "Shan't I disturb you?",
  "5720": "Non es eques, quare?",
  "5721": "Boys, ma'am?",
  "5722": "Wait a little, if you don't mind, and if you have time to spare?",
  "5723": "Has he asked you to give me the message?",
  "5724": "Some holy book, no doubt?",
  "5725": "Is it possible that one can forget and forsake what he once loved?",
  "5726": "Shall I put myself into the harness to be worn out like an old horse?",
  "5727": "You come from the contractor, you say?",
  "5728": "Why do you do it?",
  "5729": "Am I never to hear the last of this?",
  "5730": "You say that these thirteen millions are found to be wanting in the accounts?",
  "5731": "Then why not admit that these may be replaced some day by other moral intuitions to be evolved in an unknown future?",
  "5732": "What of yourself?",
  "5733": "Can't you now, doctor?",
  "5734": "Surely there must be someone among all of you here who will turn this shameless creature out of the room?",
  "5735": "What on earth is the use of time to a fellow who has twice as much of it as he knows what to do with?",
  "5736": "Or had he found something he wished to keep to himself?",
  "5737": "And how do these wiseacres know that man wants a normal, a virtuous choice?",
  "5738": "Why not furnish an unequivocal explanation of its object?",
  "5739": "Do you see that mainmast there?",
  "5740": "Any letters for me?",
  "5741": "Why are you so upset?",
  "5742": "Have you never felt the romance of that love?",
  "5743": "An explanation, pray, of what?",
  "5744": "And how on earth do they get at it?",
  "5745": "Do they get you bairns?",
  "5746": "Cannot one find friends among the animals, and choose some tame kid or eloquent parrot or amiable monkey?",
  "5747": "You wish to exchange crosses?",
  "5748": "Well, and did you like it very much?",
  "5749": "Would you mind describing him to me?",
  "5750": "But do you understand the mission you are fulfilling?",
  "5751": "What do YOU mean, mother?",
  "5752": "How about accidents?",
  "5753": "Do you think this is the end?",
  "5754": "Doing well, I suppose?",
  "5755": "What doth it profit to argue about hidden and dark things, concerning which we shall not be even reproved in the judgment, because we knew them not?",
  "5756": "Where 'bouts do you live?",
  "5757": "And then, mother?",
  "5758": "Do you sometimes think that I took an unfair advantage of your weakness?",
  "5759": "In what way did you mean it, sir?",
  "5760": "What did the gentleman say to her, my sonny?",
  "5761": "Did he name no one in his passion?",
  "5762": "What kind of political ambition was to result from this destructive political education?",
  "5763": "He knows them, then?",
  "5764": "Could narrow passages spread from it through the foundations of the island?",

  "5768": "Or flatter sorry bunglers?",
  "5769": "By my orders?",
  "5770": "So you do not plead guilty?",
  "5771": "Now, are not you fancying, gentlemen, that I am expressing remorse for something now, that I am asking your forgiveness for something?",
  "5772": "Would a man grow weary of such a look turned on him, of such arms held out?",
  "5773": "Why does she give me notice when it's too late?",
  "5774": "I suppose they'll take her back, won't they?",
  "5775": "D'ye know anything of it?",
  "5776": "Why then do we not follow his example, doing as he did in the countries through which we pass?",

  "5790": "Is it not obvious?",
  "5791": "Why did you come to tell me yourself, instead of sending my man?",
  "5792": "Holidays?",
  "5793": "I mean did you see the statue fall?",
  "5794": "And she refused you as she says?",
  "5795": "Father went away to give us children room, didn't he?",
  "5796": "Durbeyfield?",
  "5797": "Can I see the letter?",
  "5798": "In what then, pray, shall I obey you?",
  "5799": "Why should you make a principle out of what you yourselves are, and must be?",
  "5800": "Why should we imagine that the precious metals are likely to do so?",
  "5801": "And what did he answer?",
  "5802": "What IS the matter?",
  "5803": "Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?",

  "5817": "Now, sir, why are you late again, as usual?",
  "5818": "Might anybody ask what their brother has been saying?",
  "5819": "Well, my children, what is going on now?",
  "5820": "What death?",
  "5821": "To what party did he belong?",
  "5822": "Does that suggest nothing to you?",
  "5823": "Where away?",
  "5824": "How did you penetrate hither?",
  "5825": "Caught cold in the grottos, at night, perhaps?",
  "5826": "You are sure?",

  "5836": "Whatever have you done now?",
  "5837": "Are these things nothing?",
  "5838": "Did my sons get power and money?",
  "5839": "If they are such a happy class of people, how was it that you had such a time of punishing and hanging them within the last two years?",
  "5840": "And I have no doubt she loves you like a brother?",
  "5841": "And what have you been thinking about THEM, my busy bee?",
  "5842": "But how will it be?",
  "5843": "Could anything exceed the picture he gives one of scientific ardour?",
  "5844": "There is no exit that way?",
  "5845": "But was he worse?",
  "5846": "Yet how long before it was unsettled again?",
  "5847": "Philanthropy's sake?",
  "5848": "Or are they late because they have had a lovers' meeting?",
  "5849": "Is he very ill?",
  "5850": "Did he know them before?",
  "5851": "Cranly asked softly, happier than you are now, for instance?",

  "5855": "How can I urge my daughters now to go and raise large families?",
  "5856": "And what did it matter?",
  "5857": "What are you meddling with, stupid?",
  "5858": "Why do you specify the fox?",
  "5859": "Who said that?",
  "5860": "But you have found out something for yourself?",
  "5861": "What is filled with more real existence, and actually has a more real existence, is more really filled than that which is filled with less real existence and is less real?",
  "5862": "Well, what if I could?",
  "5863": "Did you bet?",
  "5864": "Are you not weary of that stupid, meaningless, constantly repeated fraud?",
  "5865": "I say, you're not putting off a party tonight, are you?",
  "5866": "Well, then, what'll we make him the ink out of?",
  "5867": "But, bishop, the question is, who has the power to settle it?",
  "5868": "Don't you trust me?",
  "5869": "What does friendship mean if it not so?",

  "5878": "Would he have drawn back?",
  "5879": "Why must he go around hunting for some one who is supporting me or has supported me at some time in his life, and who has said something at some time contrary to that platform?",
  "5880": "Had ever a queen such a throne before?",
  "5881": "And what do YOU want?",
  "5882": "Or was he a debtor or a debtor's son?",
  "5883": "Not quite so far, I hope?",
  "5884": "You are not angry with me?",
  "5885": "For what is maintenance?",
  "5886": "What will you?",

  "5890": "But, after the ball, why had he not returned?",
  "5891": "And where did you hear it?",
  "5892": "What the devil could that handkerchief signify?",
  "5893": "What data could he expect from an uncleaned watch?",
  "5894": "But what is all this about?",
  "5895": "Can't we come?",
  "5896": "And destroy their lives, when they've helped me to remake mine?",
  "5897": "But need we fear anything beyond a momentary anger?",

  "5901": "What shall we do, then, to push this great war of freedom and justice to its righteous conclusion?",
  "5902": "Will you get the mail, dear?",
  "5903": "Yes, very noble?",
  "5904": "Do you know where I am leading you?",
  "5905": "Did we notify them of this sage view of ours when we borrowed their money?",
  "5906": "Why did you form a monster so hideous that even YOU turned from me in disgust?",
  "5907": "Atone for a fault by paying money?",
  "5908": "How can you build on such a quicksand?",
  "5909": "The proper determination of these relations rests on the question, to what faculty of cognition they subjectively belong, whether to sensibility or understanding?",
  "5910": "Of what use then is he who abridges the details of those matters of which he professes to give thorough information, while he leaves behind the chief part of the things of which the whole is composed?",
  "5911": "Is that cough of his better?",
  "5912": "Why does he not look at me?",
  "5913": "From what house does the young noble come?",
  "5914": "But now how stands the wind?",
  "5915": "You promise me that frankness?",
  "5916": "And are you building?",

  "5924": "Yea, and what work, king's daughter?",
  "5925": "You're going to keep open the proposition, so to speak?",
  "5926": "How long will the air in the reservoirs last for us to breathe on board?",
  "5927": "What have you to offer to me, my friend?",
  "5928": "Why say ye so?",
  "5929": "No doubt you felt this yourself?",

  "5932": "And that principle which repels the musical, or the just?",
  "5933": "Why had he withheld life from her?",
  "5934": "And that isn't much, is it?",
  "5935": "Is life grievous to you?",
  "5936": "And are we to be carried on far and away into remote distance, and never, never to return?",
  "5937": "Why do you speak so?",
  "5938": "As for what you do me the honor to say, I presume you mean I was afraid?",
  "5939": "So, why not accept these sports as legitimate expressions of a normal and wholesome human nature?",
  "5940": "Whose camp are you in, those who bless or those who curse?",
  "5941": "Is it my mother?",
  "5942": "What is your opinion of it?",
  "5943": "How in the world did you deduce that?",

  "5949": "And silent all?",
  "5950": "What keeps them dancing till five o'clock in the morning through a whole mortal season?",
  "5951": "Why is it not seen that these ideas are mutually repellent, and that, if, by some impossibility, the proletaire could reach a certain degree of intelligence, he would make use of it in the first place to revolutionize society and change all civil and industrial relations?",
  "5952": "What can it be, then?",
  "5953": "Are you aware what you are saying, my lord?",
  "5954": "So much per man?",
  "5955": "What made you go away with him?",
  "5956": "Will all things be set right in the nation?",

  "6972": "And afterwards?",
  "6973": "Won't you come have a drink?",
  "6974": "Will there be any orders, your honor?",
  "6975": "What did the peasants want, nurse?",
  "6976": "And does the husband of this frightful creature still live?",
  "6977": "And extraordinarily like, isn't it?",
  "6978": "What do you think I have given you money for?",
  "6979": "My aunt, consequently?",
  "6980": "Embarrassed whom?",

  "6987": "I am looked upon as a madman, am I not?",
  "6988": "And is no difference made by the circumstance that one of the fingers is in the middle and another at the extremity?",
  "6989": "You can't answer for him?",
  "6990": "Were we free of the iceberg?",
  "6991": "How then does a protector begin to change into a tyrant?",
  "6992": "Can't you see them, man?",
  "6993": "What devil were able to overthrow such walls?",
  "6994": "To being in love?",
  "6995": "What is the young man's own account of the matter?",
  "6996": "Well, but what should you do?",
  "6997": "What terms shall we find which have not been already exhausted?",
  "6998": "Can he do otherwise?",
  "6999": "Where were you going?",
  "7000": "And do you not blush to own it?",
  "7001": "For whom?",
  "7002": "A poor blind man, whom you will have to lead about by the hand?",
  "7003": "Why should anyone desire to steal it or to publish it?",
  "7004": "I suppose you are wondering what it's all about?",
  "7005": "Are you leaving me thus?",
  "7006": "Surely you must be dull in the country in the winter, aren't you?",
  "7007": "Some time, then?",
  "7008": "How else can we account for the inextinguishable desire in the human mind to find a firm footing in some region beyond the limits of the world of experience?",
  "7009": "What do you command?",
  "7010": "That feels good, doesn't it?",
  "7011": "Why don't they whip these creatures?",

  "7015": "And the next stage?",
  "7016": "The two of us?",
  "7017": "You like so much to be alone?",

  "7020": "Honest injun, you ain't a ghost?",
  "7021": "And now what had we better do?",
  "7022": "Are you the one I met on the beach?",
  "7023": "But do you imagine that the story of the watch ended there?",
  "7024": "Do people marry whom they like?",

  "7034": "Or what inducement has the manufacturer?",
  "7035": "Do they still continue, or have they ceased, to propagate?",
  "7036": "Do you remember what we said to each other this morning about telling our faults?",
  "7037": "Why is it others see things and I don't?",

  "7041": "Why should you expose your game to your adversary?",
  "7042": "How, then, could competition ever be complete?",
  "7043": "But why have I not heard of him before?",

  "7045": "I hope you are not going to leave me?",
  "7046": "If this political atmosphere can disturb the equanimity of one so guarded and so prudent as he is, what will be the result with me, so careless, so outspoken as I am?",
  "7047": "You are returning, perhaps, to your duty?",
  "7048": "But they are all in order, you say?",
  "7049": "What about an official visit?",
  "7050": "And you know nothing of his present situation?",
  "7051": "What's the matter with 'em?",
  "7052": "And why was he thus anxious?",
  "7053": "You heard nothing?",
  "7054": "What did she say?",
  "7055": "Don't you recognize the man?",
  "7056": "What made you change from the nice business your father left you?",
  "7057": "What's the matter with her?",

  "7062": "Why do you shout like that?",
  "7063": "You do not think of going?",
  "7064": "But what makes the end agreeable?",
  "7065": "An't it beautiful?",
  "7066": "How'm I to get out of it?",
  "7067": "What good star brings you here?",
  "7068": "Why should they not aim at a common literature, and bring their various common laws, their marriage laws, and so on, into uniformity?",
  "7069": "How is that, count?",
  "7070": "Don't you see what a cropper we would have come if she hadn't settled down as she has?",
  "7071": "But whither are we bound?",
  "7072": "While they were thus employed, the matron, who had been impatiently watching until the dying woman should awaken from her stupor, joined them by the fire, and sharply asked how long she was to wait?",
  "7073": "O, good cousin, I am a little busy, how does my niece?",
  "7074": "How can you ask me if I am listening?",
  "7075": "Have you no reason to suspect, when he goes out with the horses to exercise them or to take a message, that he stops about talking to his acquaintances, or goes into houses where he has no business, leaving the horses outside?",
  "7076": "What does he think of it all?",
  "7077": "To whom is this accorded?",
  "7078": "Sleep?",
  "7079": "Is the security sufficient?",
  "7080": "Is it thirst of gold?",
  "7081": "Be turnd off?",
  "7082": "NOT connected?",
  "7083": "Besides, was he not as ugly as ever?",
  "7084": "What do you suppose?",
  "7085": "And you say that you are ignorant of the contents of this letter?",
  "7086": "Him?",
  "7087": "What is a surprise?",
  "7088": "Is there a moon?",
  "7089": "But what will be reported of the sudden death of the poor old servant?",
  "7090": "How could I tell?",
  "7091": "Is't right?",
  "7092": "What became of the seven children?",
  "7093": "What shall I be if she becomes my wife?",
  "7094": "Uncle?",
  "7095": "And were you?",
  "7096": "Why am I angry with him, do you ask, my mother?",
  "7097": "Oh, do you really think so?",
  "7098": "Now, have I your permission to go?",
  "7099": "Could you not repeat it for me?",
  "7100": "So he cherishes no resentment?",
  "7101": "Still on foot?",
  "7102": "Then why did he purchase it?",
  "7103": "Yes, please?",
  "7104": "Won't you?",
  "7105": "Is it that she cannot or that she will not express what she feels and thinks?",
  "7106": "The whole of it?",
  "7107": "Who does now?",
  "7108": "Is that you, dear friend?",
  "7109": "Where can you get any and how can you get it?",
  "7110": "Well, what did I say?",
  "7111": "And what manner of government do you term oligarchy?",
  "7112": "At farthest?",
  "7113": "No, why so?",
  "7114": "But, papa, where will the matron live?",
  "7115": "Who besides me has met that long look of love that has burnt itself into my soul, so that no other image can come there?",
  "7116": "Will you tell us one thing?",
  "7117": "How would he open the door for me?",
  "7118": "How can I take her away now, when I have no money?",
  "7119": "And is there no means of making him revoke his decision?",
  "7120": "But why was this affection distressed?",
  "7121": "You believe in glory, then?",
  "7122": "How's the cows?",
  "7123": "What is the day, daughter?",
  "7124": "Do you want an honest answer?",
  "7125": "And asking, why?",
  "7126": "By that flue?",
  "7127": "That's all you think of me, is it?",
  "7128": "Will you come and look at 'im and see it's all right?",
  "7129": "You don't know?",
  "7130": "Is he not flesh of her flesh and bone of her bone, and must he not so continue?",
  "7131": "All that was plainly in your orders, all that was well executed, very punctually, was it not?",
  "7132": "And why has the count bought a rock?",
  "7133": "So you liked my song?",
  "7134": "Why are taxes paid?",
  "7135": "May I ask what you were doing there?",
  "7136": "What is that?",
  "7137": "We're not the meek?",
  "7138": "Why stand ye there?",
  "7139": "Should you have gone to her then?",
  "7140": "Where else should I go?",
  "7141": "Now, what's he speaking about, and who's he speaking to, I should like to know?",
  "7142": "Or where was he?",
  "7143": "Heather on fire?",
  "7144": "If one's not to live together, what's the use of marrying?",
  "7145": "Why not the simpler way?",
  "7146": "But you do not understand any of the peals?",
  "7147": "What cart?",
  "7148": "Isn't she ripe now?",
  "7149": "But what do you intend to do?",
  "7150": "Where's your brother?",
  "7151": "I come for my girl, see?",
  "7152": "Do you then make nothing at all of her having been so ready to leave us?",
  "7153": "For what do good men who make the best soldiers fight?",
  "7154": "What is your last name again, say you?",
  "7155": "He was not the first that had played away a few trifles, and of what use were birth and fortune if they would not admit some sallies and expenses?",
  "7156": "Would not a peer who, by chance of fortune, might suddenly be driven to herd among the navvies be as afraid of the jeers of his companions, as would any navvy suddenly exalted to a seat among the peers?",
  "7157": "They haven't anything, have they?",
  "7158": "Is it me you want?",
  "7159": "And this lady?",
  "7160": "Object to him, guardian?",
  "7161": "How would you like to be shut up for hours with a nervous, fussy old lady, who keeps you trotting, is never satisfied, and worries you till you you're ready to fly out the window or cry?",
  "7162": "Who sent it me?",
  "7163": "You've not heard?",
  "7164": "What can you do with a man like that?",
  "7165": "Do these animals possess a power of communicating with each other?",
  "7166": "Well, but wasn't it the most fortunate thing in the world?",
  "7167": "Will you never learn?",
  "7168": "Do you live here in the city?",
  "7169": "Shouldn't we light a lantern?",
  "7170": "What was the relation between them, and what the object of his repeated visits?",
  "7171": "You mistrust me, then, master pedant, do you?",
  "7172": "Was ever the like?",
  "7173": "Does not this little book clear up the mystery of your parentage?",
  "7174": "If the news is not to be bad why have our weapons been taken from us?",
  "7175": "Can't I go away from here, run away, bury myself somewhere?",
  "7176": "Else why should he talk about his 'twenty minutes past' and about his having no watch to tell the time by?",
  "7177": "More?",
  "7178": "Or doth the animal speak in thy wish, and necessity?",
  "7179": "Who sends you?",
  "7180": "Can you, ma'am?",
  "7181": "Who can 'scape his bow?",
  "7182": "Of course you agree to have a battle?",
  "7183": "Do you stay here long?",
  "7184": "From whom?",
  "7185": "I do not address her brother?",
  "7186": "Are we then going to travel, my lord?",
  "7187": "And to whom would this document be sent if it fell into the hands of an enemy?",
  "7188": "Charlotte and I?",
  "7189": "What's the good of our going away together?",
  "7190": "Cake?",
  "7191": "O, whither I?",
  "7192": "Why did you not accept it?",
  "7193": "And does he know about the rosette?",
  "7194": "Ah, but what is the matter with your hand, d'Artagnan?",
  "7195": "You've not done right, have you, now?",
  "7196": "Do you hear me, you fairy spirit?",
  "7197": "Is history to be written from such documents?",
  "7198": "Is what this paper says, the truth?",
  "7199": "And can you forget so soon what I proposed to you the other night?",
  "7200": "But, madame, what can he do, unless he has a kingdom to back him?",
  "7201": "Where was my son?",
  "7202": "But does not the present case fairly constitute an exception?",
  "7203": "English money?",
  "7204": "How could she extricate herself from this labyrinth?",
  "7205": "But what shall we do now?",
  "7206": "Know you of what materials some hearts are made?",
  "7207": "This other gentleman is in the preaching line, I think?",
  "7208": "The count has the message?",
  "7209": "What's her trump card?",
  "7210": "She is not another man's wife, and it appears that she has married me according to the custom of this awful place, so who is the worse?",
  "7211": "Gracious goodness, and who's to make my chocolate?",
  "7212": "Why, what class are they?",
  "7213": "Can I have fifty?",
  "7214": "Would it not be a sweet revenge for him when he found that I had not died from the blow of his dagger?",
  "7215": "They will not blunder?",
  "7216": "Why do I say this?",
  "7217": "Can you read?",
  "7218": "And you are disposed to serve the cause of the people?",
  "7219": "Do you or don't you?",
  "7220": "But how shall I prevent his departure, if that should turn out to be my last resource?",
  "7221": "Wonder how old he is?",
  "7222": "You prefer not to perhaps?",
  "7223": "Are you?",
  "7224": "And could you see if my brother is here, and send him to me?",
  "7225": "And if he chances to return again?",
  "7226": "Oh, you mean commercially?",
  "7227": "Will you tell me?",
  "7228": "From whence do these papers come, you say?",
  "7229": "Will you take the time from me?",
  "7230": "And the reason why the good are useless has now been explained?",
  "7231": "P'raps you might be writin' to her?",
  "7232": "At what point shall I begin my story, your excellency?",
  "7233": "Who knows what unhappiness may not be lurking for me, ready to spring at any moment?",
  "7234": "Will you leave him to the allurements of the world and the devil?",
  "7235": "Can't you do anything except soldiers?",
  "7236": "What ones?",
  "7237": "What is the percentage?",
  "7238": "What responsibilities?",
  "7239": "You mean that the person will come again?",
  "7240": "To whom, then?",
  "7241": "And that will be soon, will it not?",
  "7242": "Why were they so desirous of having me for their host?",
  "7243": "Had I overrated the importance of the discovery?",
  "7244": "At this time o' night, and such a night?",
  "7245": "Where an the sweetmeats?",
  "7246": "So you know his name?",
  "7247": "What is to be done with him?",
  "7248": "What on earth for?",
  "7249": "Don't you know father better than that by this time?",
  "7250": "Tell me who made the world?",
  "7251": "Is he one of your acquaintance?",
  "7252": "Are you awfully unhappy?",
  "7253": "What, then, is the matter with them?",
  "7254": "But you can dance?",
  "7255": "Do we not make our livings by doing nought of any good?",
  "7256": "Is he never robbed?",
  "7257": "Andrea?",
  "7258": "Father, why have you thus incens'd them both?",
  "7259": "Why am I not to talk about it?",
  "7260": "Then, how did it happen?",
  "7261": "Don't you hear the hammer at work?",
  "7262": "Is the team harnessed?",
  "7263": "Really, prince, do you think we are such fools as not to be aware that this matter does not come within the law, and that legally we cannot claim a rouble from you?",
  "7264": "Can you read this language?",
  "7265": "He?",
  "7266": "Who do you like best downstairs?",
  "7267": "Will you be a little more explicit?",
  "7268": "Suppose he were in a railway train, would they stop it for him?",
  "7269": "Can we afford to sin any more deeply against human liberty?",
  "7270": "Might it not be better simply to buy up the editorial staff?",
  "7271": "And who was the winner?",
  "7272": "After all, what does it matter?",
  "7273": "You will?",
  "7274": "What reason have you to be morose?",
  "7275": "Are you telling the truth when you say you are not in love?",
  "7276": "And why is it?",
  "7277": "Susan, you agree?",
  "7278": "Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me?",
  "7279": "Must they give him up?",
  "7280": "If the scene through which I have just passed has taught me to reflect, and has awakened me to a more anxious and careful sense of duty, why should I wait until the impression has cooled?",
  "7281": "Why should I take you for him?",
  "7282": "Would you be pleased to walk into the garden?",
  "7283": "Especially as at that time we didn't know one another quite so well as we do now, did we, dear?",
  "7284": "Then why venture there?",
  "7285": "Is she very angry with me?",
  "7286": "Yes what?",
  "7287": "In what way?",
  "7288": "And why is that chronique the elaborately absurd set of legends which we find in all mythologies?",
  "7289": "But why do you not go to the inn?",
  "7290": "A prisoner?",
  "7291": "Are there reasons?",
  "7292": "Is there, indeed, my good fellow?",
  "7293": "Is it your habit to swear much in talking?",
  "7294": "What became of your magic tools?",
  "7295": "You have been resident in my house three months?",
  "7296": "How can we best do it?",
  "7297": "How many of us are here?",
  "7298": "May I ask, in the meanwhile, whether you have yourself any theory to account for this young man's disappearance?",
  "7299": "Have not I, the king, the right to ask of you all that?",
  "7300": "Don't you want to tidy yourself?",
  "7301": "What is the matter in the crowd behind us?",
  "7302": "What made you ask him that?",
  "7303": "Go away?",
  "7304": "And who were the enemy?",
  "7305": "But why any proclamation now upon this subject?",
  "7306": "You'll soon have plenty to do now, dear, won't you?",
  "7307": "One only?",
  "7308": "How about it, then?",
  "7309": "Do you see, stupid?",
  "7310": "How dare you remind me of that horrid dinner party, when yours is so nice in every way?",

  "7327": "Are you going with him?",
  "7328": "Did he come himself, or send over a deputy?",
  "7329": "Is it the principle of knowledge or of goodness, or the union of the two?",
  "7330": "Did you believe that I should go with no farewell to those who haf been so heavenly kind to me?",
  "7331": "Was the mission one in which gentleness would be possible?",
  "7332": "For what purpose do you put such a question to me?",

  "7351": "Splendid?",
  "7352": "What does the twilight matter?",
  "7353": "In the centre?",
  "7354": "And it would be a disgrace to marry so, eh?",
  "7355": "NOW, where are these imminent dangers?",
  "7356": "Or, meeting so, why did we not part as strangers?",
  "7357": "What would papa say to that?",
  "7358": "Does she know that you mean to marry her?",

  "7371": "Did you ever know anything so disappointing?",
  "7372": "How did he know all this?",
  "7373": "What regiment?",
  "7374": "Is that so much that he deserves this praise?",
  "7375": "How did he get there with a child?",
  "7376": "And you reply?",
  "7377": "Do you not admire her?",

  "7384": "Is there one of my brethren in whom you have equal confidence with myself?",
  "7385": "What's the rent?",
  "7386": "Like a demd native?",
  "7387": "What for, sire?",
  "7388": "And do you mean, by living away from me, living by yourself?",

  "7418": "Why doesn't he get away?",
  "7419": "Did I say, a few days since, that I had nothing to do with him but to receive my salary at his hands?",
  "7420": "And to what end can it serve either for the service of mankind, or for my own private interest?",
  "7421": "In the few hours that I can possibly allow to elapse before I publish the truth, how is he to be found by us, and only by us?",
  "7422": "Will you have a glass of brandy?",
  "7423": "And fetch him where?",

  "7446": "If our asteroid has carried with it a portion of the old earth's atmosphere, why should it not likewise retain something of its central fire?",
  "7447": "And this assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice or gesture, is the imitation of the person whose character he assumes?",
  "7448": "Somebody else?",

  "7491": "Is there anything the matter?",
  "7492": "A warning for himself?",
  "7493": "To sit?",

  "7586": "And that mysterious staircase, the passage through which, not to disturb their sleep, the doctor and nurse pass, or even the father carrying the sleeping child?",
  "7587": "Do you hate it?",
  "7588": "How a wedding present?",
  "7589": "What else?",
  "7590": "And he was alone in achieving an enterprise like that?",

  "7624": "If the prince knew propriety, who does not know it?",
  "7625": "Now, we ask, what was there in this cave to cause a departure from the ordinary course of nature?",
  "7626": "What's the matter aloft there?",
  "7627": "Should war break out in any of those countries who can foretell the extent to which it may be carried or the desolation which it may spread?",

  "7635": "So you've got back?",
  "7636": "Then why don't you turn her out?",
  "7637": "Why should he go to a play if he enjoys it so little?",
  "7638": "Was it an angel's voice?",
  "7639": "Why, then, had he come hither?",
  "7640": "What was his version?",
  "7641": "Is it not perfectly clear, that this argument applies with exactly as much force to every combination of human beings for a common purpose, as to governments?",
  "7642": "Yet what good end can all this superficial counsel produce?",
  "7643": "What's the report of this boy?",
  "7644": "Take a glass of wine?",
  "7645": "And what has become of that scoundrel?",
  "7646": "But, what will you do?",
  "7647": "Are you coming down and fight fair?",

  "7657": "He has had punch already, has he not, sir?",
  "7658": "Shall you come down in the world for want of this letter about your son?",
  "7659": "Why, instead of fascinating us with contradictory opinions, did he not reverse experience by causing us to reach the antinomies by the path of analysis of synthetic ideas, instead of leaving us to painfully clamber up the steeps of antinomy to synthesis?",
  "7660": "So, then, you must leave us?",
  "7661": "But at any rate I have shown, have I not, that there is a certain element of improbability about the lady's story?",
  "7662": "And do you use this often?",
  "7663": "Has he got any?",
  "7664": "Are they friendly to us, do you think?",
  "7665": "Me alone?",
  "7666": "And you allow then, sir, that spheres exist, and that these marked and invisible beings mingle amongst us?",
  "7667": "Who knows if they will not manage to restore to me my pension?",
  "7668": "Who would not, when there was the pretext of casting disgrace upon him, confound his whole life and the truths he had espoused, in one heap of obloquy?",

  "7670": "Is she dead?",
  "7671": "But were you not on horseback?",
  "7672": "Is the countess up yet?",
  "7673": "Then this young man escaped with you?",
  "7674": "Where are my armies, my troops, my treasures?",
  "7675": "Canler?",
  "7676": "Do you belong to the number of the happy or of the miserable?",
  "7677": "But why couldn't he let me know?",
  "7678": "Will you promise to be quiet, and not kick up a fuss if I get you something to eat?",
  "7679": "And they not rich?",
  "7680": "In the rouge way?",
  "7681": "She did not resist, for what could she do?",
  "7682": "I shall hear from you?",
  "7683": "What what is, my dear?",
  "7684": "What did you do yesterday afternoon?",
  "7685": "Exploring or what?",
  "7686": "Why was he carried in a cart?",
  "7687": "Why surprised?",
  "7688": "What are you kicking up this row for?",

  "7696": "Two figures?",
  "7697": "What will dart out presently?",
  "7698": "Does he regret me a little?",

  "7700": "You remember?",
  "7701": "Then why are there different faiths?",
  "7702": "What be they?",

  "7705": "There's her boots now, nice and decent for her evening use, and isn't it grand brushes she has?",
  "7706": "Is this your pupil?",
  "7707": "And what, pray, WAS the price?",
  "7708": "How is it with you?",
  "7709": "What o'clock is it?",
  "7710": "How could you go to live in a street like that, which is sickly, which is disagreeable, which is ugly, which has a barrier at one end, where one is cold, and into which one cannot enter?",
  "7711": "Surely the writer does not mean that a pleasant or delectable island would not be fit for breeding horses?",
  "7712": "You are a good temper?",
  "7713": "Had the crew seen me disappear?",
  "7714": "Don't you think we will?",
  "7715": "Now, do you understand me?",
  "7716": "How many times will I have to speak of this matter?",
  "7717": "On your arm?",
  "7718": "I understand, however, from the inquest that there were some objects which you failed to overlook?",
  "7719": "Why don't you go and get it then?",
  "7720": "Where are the graces of my soul?",
  "7721": "Do you know, sir, said she, that her ladyship intends to be down here with you in a few days?",
  "7722": "What is the meaning of this hunt, skipper?",
  "7723": "Why, had you no unicorn's horn, nor bezoar's stone about you, ha?",
  "7724": "What if in this interval the race had lost its manliness and had developed into something inhuman, unsympathetic, and overwhelmingly powerful?",
  "7725": "Had he ever lost his heart so much to something, had he ever loved any person thus, thus blindly, thus sufferingly, thus unsuccessfully, and yet thus happily?",
  "7726": "Did you really think me capable of that?",
  "7727": "How do you like her, my dear?",
  "7728": "Shall I sure?",
  "7729": "And what did the master answer?",
  "7730": "Bobby?",
  "7731": "Is she sorry for her shameful conduct?",
  "7732": "Had he found some madman's means of proclaiming the scandal aloud?",
  "7733": "Whose portraits are those?",
  "7734": "What was the subject of these singular conversations?",
  "7735": "Is it a check to the action of the individual?",
  "7736": "She is melancholy, then?",
  "7737": "Have you noticed THAT THEY WON'T LET ANY ONE TOUCH THEM?",
  "7738": "What sympathy should a holy preacher have with either?",
  "7739": "Is is a bargain?",
  "7740": "Would not your excellency like a little refreshment?",
  "7741": "So, then, they have paid my ransom?",
  "7742": "Well, mademoiselle, what are you thinking about, standing there like a statue?",
  "7743": "Will you undertake the task?",
  "7744": "Tell me, will you do this for me, and cease to weep?",
  "7745": "Come, how much?",
  "7746": "Do you know, sir, that you are asking me very strange questions, and that I am very foolish to answer them?",
  "7747": "There is a principle of law and reason in him which bids him resist, as well as a feeling of his misfortune which is forcing him to indulge his sorrow?",
  "7748": "Shall I climb the magnolia?",
  "7749": "What becomes of them?",
  "7750": "You aren't angry, are you?",
  "7751": "Eh, madame, who knows?",
  "7752": "The ghost?",
  "7753": "Then why hasn't she missed him before?",
  "7754": "Gwendolen, will you marry me?",
  "7755": "Wouldn't you like to know who I am, child?",

  "7767": "What shall we do then?",
  "7768": "Jean, do you think that I am quite mad?",
  "7769": "Why is not her joy complete?",
  "7770": "Do you know his abode?",
  "7771": "And who was this uncle?",
  "7772": "And will not such things sharpen your souls to revenge?",
  "7773": "Oh, what do you want?",
  "7774": "Who asked after a day or two?",
  "7775": "How could she have been so blind?",
  "7776": "Is this our previous understanding?",
  "7777": "Certainly, why not?",
  "7778": "What orders, your excellency?",
  "7779": "Suppose the worst?",
  "7780": "Then you will not resign, under any circumstances?",

  "8180": "Then what are we going to do?",
  "8181": "But why not?",
  "8182": "Was he our malignant enemy, or was he by chance our guardian angel?",
  "8183": "A storm?",
  "8184": "Hasn't it?",
  "8185": "Am I to consider this as part of my income on account?",
  "8186": "What has all this money done?",
  "8187": "Can it be a ship?",
  "8188": "What do I hear?",
  "8189": "Won't she feel forsaken and deserted?",
  "8190": "Copper?",
  "8191": "Why did you steal it?",
  "8192": "Did you feel nothing of it yesterday or the day before?",
  "8193": "Lena does?",
  "8194": "How do you mean?",
  "8195": "And how have you been since?",
  "8196": "Is it a freshwater lake?",
  "8197": "And the princess?",
  "8198": "But why should I tell you more?",
  "8199": "When is the pause after that sentence ever broken by reply?",
  "8200": "I hope, I trust, something better, doctor?",
  "8201": "Did you ever sail a ship?",
  "8202": "Why did you fire a gun, a little while ago?",
  "8203": "Whom?",
  "8204": "And what do you think will be the end of this?",
  "8205": "But why was that flag hoisted at the brig's peak?",
  "8206": "Shall I tell them to go away?",
  "8207": "What can be the meaning of it?",
  "8208": "But what else could I have done?",
  "8209": "But this supreme cause being a necessity of the human mind, what is there to prevent us from attributing to it such a degree of perfection as to place it above the sphere of all that is possible?",
  "8210": "Who generated them?",
  "8211": "Or should they be so many as almost entirely to compose the state?",
  "8212": "Who's the better man at that?",
  "8213": "Why do you not speak to him, and tell him how he disquiets your house?",
  "8214": "But pardon me, are you free?",
  "8215": "But you haven't got any money?",
  "8216": "What did missy want with more books?",
  "8217": "Who was my lover?",
  "8218": "Could someone go to carry her bag?",
  "8219": "Why should they try to influence him?",
  "8220": "Did you ever?",
  "8221": "You're sure her chamber is above the hallway, and that there's a staircase to it from the main hall?",
  "8222": "Is that all you have to say for yourself?",
  "8223": "But what should he do?",
  "8224": "Will you let me go?",
  "8225": "Do I not already stand here wet with thy misery, and drenched like a dog?",
  "8226": "What's all this for?",
  "8227": "Why don't you jump, you bloody fool?",
  "8228": "Why should not we have a poetry and philosophy of insight, and not of tradition?",
  "8229": "Later?",
  "8230": "Must we in all things look for the how and the why and wherefore?",
  "8231": "But can we think, that on this occasion he reflects on any past experience, and calls to remembrance instances, that he has seen or heard of, in order to discover the effects of water on animal bodies?",
  "8232": "Are they as far out as this?",
  "8233": "Did you ever hear anything so awful as that?",
  "8234": "What have we to do with this toothless fool?",
  "8235": "And will she stay very long?",
  "8236": "No offence?",
  "8237": "Who's banging?",
  "8238": "Do I look like it?",
  "8239": "What has given you offence?",
  "8240": "Who was the moral man?",
  "8241": "Do you agree?",
  "8242": "Now, what is the form of procedure?",
  "8243": "Why does he give himself away to such canaille?",
  "8244": "Do you think he does?",
  "8245": "Have you a house in that neighbourhood?",
  "8246": "Charley?",
  "8247": "Are strangers with your tribute to be tax'd?",
  "8248": "Has the law ears to be melted by your sweet voice?",
  "8249": "Who calls me villain?",
  "8250": "Do you think so, my lord?",
  "8251": "Of course she must give him an answer, but how would she give it?",
  "8252": "What makes you put so much butter on the steak?",
  "8253": "You say you are this young lady's brother?",
  "8254": "Why is it that you doubt my word?",
  "8255": "Why didn't I never hear this before?",
  "8256": "You put me off, do you?",
  "8257": "No one observes us?",
  "8258": "And what will you say to them?",
  "8259": "What can they be doing inside?",
  "8260": "I suppose you don't care for me in that way any more?",
  "8261": "And what do you think of her personal appearance?",
  "8262": "And you will obey me, will you not?",
  "8263": "Have you any objection to my looking at your register?",
  "8264": "Or would the meteor prove too powerful for it?",
  "8265": "Could she be dreaming?",
  "8266": "We do seem to make a little progress, do we not?",
  "8267": "Where's the use of asking for such fellows' reasons?",
  "8268": "But what do you believe?",
  "8269": "I can work, then?",
  "8270": "Now what say you to a pasty, or a strip of beef cut where the juice runs, and maybe the half of a broiled fowl?",
  "8271": "Whether he could rush to the next assizes, and proclaim himself a lawyer?",
  "8272": "How can you ask me?",
  "8273": "And is the sum you bring me worth the trouble?",
  "8274": "How do you feel this morning?",
  "8275": "Where can you live?",
  "8276": "Where is that?",
  "8277": "Why do you point away?",
  "8278": "Or do they fall short of this perfect equality in a measure?",
  "8279": "How had I deserved to be so blessed by such confessions?",
  "8280": "Is not this rather an ad hominem style of argument?",
  "8281": "When does the projectile start?",
  "8282": "And that one yonder?",
  "8283": "In vain I ask the air and the trees why I should not drown myself?",
  "8284": "Haven't you got anything to say to me?",
  "8285": "Why did he not speak?",
  "8286": "Jarvie?",
  "8287": "I wonder why you ever fell in love with me?",
  "8288": "Tell us then boldly, what we must do for you?",
  "8289": "Of course, he did save the country, didn't he?",
  "8290": "It will not scratch and claw, but pet and comfort?",
  "8291": "Doth it not strike you as being passing strange that the land is not filled with couriers and proclamations describing my person and making search for me?",
  "8292": "How does she live?",
  "8293": "Who stole my bread?",
  "8294": "Were we to die as he had done?",
  "8295": "Is it then surprising, that when the sole ambition of woman centres in beauty, and interest gives vanity additional force, perpetual rivalships should ensue?",
  "8296": "Then what on earth are they up to?",
  "8297": "Why do I come to you thus?",
  "8298": "You will ask me why I did not dispose of it?",
  "8299": "What have you to say now?",
  "8300": "Do you mean, were we talking about diamonds?",
  "8301": "Or, if the master would not stay, then the disciples would have followed him about everywhere, until they had got education enough?",
  "8302": "Shall I carry no message, madame?",
  "8303": "Aren't they terrifying?",
  "8304": "Would any man weary of it, or wish to turn away his eyes?",
  "8305": "What am I to say to him?",
  "8306": "What more can he do?",
  "8307": "But who can be angry at those assiduities which are meant to please him?",
  "8308": "Does that kind go smoothly?",
  "8309": "Does it hurt?",
  "8310": "Didn't you really know it all before?",
  "8311": "Where are you, old fellow?",
  "8312": "And have quite forgiven me?",
  "8313": "Did I say a word when he came and took me away, for no earthly reason, from the place where everybody was kind to me?",
  "8314": "How did you know it, then?",
  "8315": "Burning up your awld aunt's rubbidge, I suppose?",
  "8316": "Which room shall we do first?",
  "8317": "Mine?",
  "8318": "You would not make him a cuckold?",
  "8319": "Has he brought back the prisoners?",
  "8320": "What may be thy name?",
  "8321": "For what does reason discover, when it pronounces any action vicious?",
  "8322": "But why should you want to paint me?",
  "8323": "What do you wish?",
  "8324": "Why is the workingman prohibited from charging a like interest for his capital, which is himself?",
  "8325": "Are you ashamed of it?",
  "8326": "Do you think he won't be happy with me?",
  "8327": "But you expected some one then?",
  "8328": "And did he spring clean from the mark or had he to get off with a push?",
  "8329": "You did not see her?",
  "8330": "Tell me what should you say, darling?",
  "8331": "But, in the name of heaven, man, where did you get these extraordinary clothes?",
  "8332": "You say you heard a knocking?",
  "8333": "But what is to be done now?",
  "8334": "But how did you feel when you were loved by a servant?",
  "8335": "Dobbin?",
  "8336": "Will you set them fighting still further, or will you make peace between them?",
  "8337": "Do you suppose if there was any offence given me, I shouldn't name it, and request to have it corrected?",
  "8338": "Think we're liable to have much trouble?",
  "8339": "You've brought it, have you?",
  "8340": "What think you my friend did?",
  "8341": "And what imports this?",
  "8342": "Biribi?",
  "8343": "What more did I want?",
  "8344": "In the middle of the performance?",
  "8345": "What in the world can be more ridiculous than commercial laws carried out to one's own detriment?",
  "8346": "Didn't I say it all along?",
  "8347": "With THEM?",
  "8348": "And why do we fuss and fume sometimes?",
  "8349": "But why would you return to face again the fierce banth, or whatever other form of destruction they have loosed within that awful trap?",
  "8350": "Do you know what my private and candid opinion is about some of those little jokers?",
  "8351": "What'll he do with it?",
  "8352": "But what next?",
  "8353": "The letter about the mortgage has come, has it?",
  "8354": "You like it so, I suppose?",
  "8355": "A robber maybe?",
  "8356": "And why do you serve?",
  "8357": "Must he see, must he know?",
  "8358": "Do they denote or connote anything?",
  "8359": "Do you, then, really return?",
  "8360": "What a temptin lookin critter you'd be among the galls, would'nt you?",
  "8361": "Think only, what are my children to be?",
  "8362": "You were not content to hear me, eh?",
  "8363": "What have I done that this burden should be laid on me?",
  "8364": "Will you bet?",
  "8365": "What did he give for that picture upstairs which the young man painted?",
  "8366": "Is not our fortune famous, brave, and great?",
  "8367": "Are you so daintily brought up, you cannot eat your own flesh?",
  "8368": "Did you see that one?",
  "8369": "Why shall I not tell the rabbis on you?",
  "8370": "Will you come up?",
  "8371": "How can you show me that you are telling the truth?",
  "8372": "What do you call it?",
  "8373": "Where is your sash, my dear?",
  "8374": "Why didn't you come home?",
  "8375": "And to whom?",
  "8376": "How long would he be left uneducated?",
  "8377": "Don't they, old thing?",
  "8378": "Only you here?",
  "8379": "Do you wish me to beg pardon of this creature because she has come here to insult our mother and disgrace the whole household, you low, base wretch?",
  "8380": "And the desire which goes beyond this, or more delicate food, or other luxuries, which might generally be got rid of, if controlled and trained in youth, and is hurtful to the body, and hurtful to the soul in the pursuit of wisdom and virtue, may be rightly called unnecessary?",
  "8381": "Ah, naughty, naughty, would you take a nip at the gentleman?",
  "8382": "What does the presence do?",
  "8383": "Who would not suffer amid perfumed tapestries, cushioned furniture, and liveried servants?",
  "8384": "Well, and how are you?",
  "8385": "Yet who else in all the world was there with the strength and agility to do what this man was now doing?",
  "8386": "Why be uneasy?",
  "8387": "So you are going to sell the place?",
  "8388": "Is he still in a fit?",
  "8389": "But heavens, why?",
  "8390": "What might you be able to do?",
  "8391": "Music?",
  "8392": "There is then more than one who might await you there?",
  "8393": "What's the matter with your tooth?",
  "8394": "Can she have it today?",
  "8395": "Well, who is my benefactor?",
  "8396": "Why so, if you please?",
  "8397": "Where is the man who was here?",
  "8398": "Who again was his closest ally?",
  "8399": "What is your history?",
  "8400": "Is he ill?",
  "8401": "Are you coming tomorrow?",
  "8402": "How now?",
  "8403": "For the best?",
  "8404": "You are home, then, my dear master?",
  "8405": "Count 'em?",
  "8406": "And did you convey this answer to your guest?",
  "8407": "By after 'all' you mean after she's in love with somebody else?",
  "8408": "Did you ever see such a den, my dear?",
  "8409": "Yet why are those names disgraceful?",
  "8410": "Not damn the sharper, but the dice?",
  "8411": "And what IS her idea?",
  "8412": "Do you feel inclined to make the monks' acquaintance once more?",
  "8413": "Why don't you wish to come back home?",
  "8414": "What do you find to attract you in this poor drab little country?",
  "8415": "Are they little, then?",
  "8416": "What are you thinking about, doctor?",
  "8417": "Is it that the poets are deliberately trying to present the conditions of an age anterior to their own?",
  "8418": "Why didn't she tell me something?",
  "8419": "What do you want me for, sir?",
  "8420": "You don't think I would shy things at you?",
  "8421": "Who spoke of such a thing?",
  "8422": "Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?",
  "8423": "What, my rival?",
  "8424": "My little lady, where are you going to?",
  "8425": "What can it mean?",
  "8426": "Would you counsel him to do so?",
  "8427": "Shall I also smite them dead?",
  "8428": "Bah, really?",
  "8429": "You dispute me?",
  "8430": "May I ask what led to this change?",
  "8431": "Why not a fortnight from now?",
  "8432": "What means this shouting in the house?",
  "8433": "And shall disaffection only be rewarded with security?",
  "8434": "Where else will one find a more happy union of magnificence and comfort, where better arrangements to facilitate commerce?",
  "8435": "May I ask why that date?",
  "8436": "You think I won't get to him?",
  "8437": "Did you get him?",
  "8438": "Is conduct everything?",
  "8439": "You have, then, a repugnance to your profession?",
  "8440": "What could be the matter?",
  "8441": "What will the other employers do?",
  "8442": "Where is the doctor?",
  "8443": "Who'll stop me?",
  "8444": "Then will you not forgive me?",
  "8445": "Would you like to speak to him?",
  "8446": "Well, how is he?",
  "8447": "Why not own your own home?",
  "8448": "Whence came it, think you?",
  "8449": "Was he angry, or pleased?",
  "8450": "But how discover what demands are just?",
  "8451": "Snow?",
  "8452": "How many miles?",
  "8453": "That's a pleasant life, isn't it?",
  "8454": "What sort of legislators were they?",
  "8455": "As he was to finish reading there, why not set out at once?",
  "8456": "Does she love me?",
  "8457": "Then, why did you think of giving your daughter to him?",
  "8458": "You won't refuse to humour one of them, I hope?",
  "8459": "Are they out beanfeasting?",
  "8460": "Is it not that we may enjoy our liberty?",
  "8461": "Whither else?",
  "8462": "How then shall I take away these opinions?",
  "8463": "You are hurt?",
  "8464": "Any occasion to show my papers?",
  "8465": "What are you laughing at, husband?",
  "8466": "And what could he say to her?",
  "8467": "What does it matter to me?",
  "8468": "But surely you would not wish to offend the bishop?",
  "8469": "Why don't you fall?",
  "8470": "Can this be my whole purpose?",
  "8471": "What did she know of this strange creature at her side?",
  "8472": "Pyramids?",
  "8473": "What is ther to do, now?",
  "8474": "How did you begin?",
  "8475": "When I heard her dismiss the footman, I stepped up to him and asked him, what little lady that was?",
  "8476": "You may ask, by what authority do I venture, being a person not concerned in the practice of medicine, to meddle with that subject?",
  "8477": "And what do you wonder?",
  "8478": "So I's to gouge out all their eyes, eh?",
  "8479": "What was it about?",
  "8480": "And the hyperbola?",
  "8481": "And in what city did you live?",
  "8482": "Are you not ashamed to speak to a wretch lying on the stones?",
  "8483": "Can I do anything for you?",
  "8484": "Yet how many people have I hated in my life?",
  "8485": "Will you take a chair?",
  "8486": "And straightway hereupon, arose the natural question of cui bono?",
  "8487": "Could that girl have been playing off any of her coquettish tricks?",
  "8488": "What was I to say?",
  "8489": "Where are you damn'd?",
  "8490": "Do you care to pursue further?",
  "8491": "You take me?",
  "8492": "What could I do but follow him?",
  "8493": "So why was she surprised?",
  "8494": "Will they be here long?",
  "8495": "What means this violence in my house?",
  "8496": "You are quite aware of that?",
  "8497": "There is to be no doubt about that, is there?",
  "8498": "What mean you?",
  "8499": "The first question is, whether a government, proposing to itself the propagation of religious truth as one of its principal ends, is more likely to lead the people right than to lead them wrong?",
  "8500": "Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed?",
  "8501": "And what if they were friends, brethren, countrymen?",
  "8502": "Have we not thieves enow among us already?",
  "8503": "I asked if the master was in?",
  "8504": "Shall I ring for them to carry you down?",
  "8505": "Is it a blaspheming clause or reserve any way scandalous unto the world?",
  "8506": "And who is this woman?",
  "8507": "What are we to fight about?",
  "8508": "And how then?",
  "8509": "Where's he going to?",
  "8510": "Do you know how my little brother is, sir?",
  "8511": "Would you like to go to school?",
  "8512": "What's a ransom?",
  "8513": "Anything wanting to the bonnet?",
  "8514": "Indeed, even apart from an analogy, is it not mighty interesting to narrate, anyway?",
  "8515": "But was I free to claim this liberty?",
  "8516": "Is he hanging somewhere?",
  "8517": "The bear?",
  "8518": "What time is it?",
  "8519": "Straker?",
  "8520": "Oh, he is, is he?",
  "8521": "Do you know the depth of the ocean?",
  "8522": "What can I do for you?",
  "8523": "Do you dare to die?",
  "8524": "Long from home?",
  "8525": "What have you done, indeed?",
  "8526": "Would the gentleman like this room?",
  "8527": "Can I drop you anywhere?",
  "8528": "Was it some midnight assassin who had come to carry out the murderous orders of the secret tribunal?",
  "8529": "But is this all that is known?",
  "8530": "Did you see?",
  "8531": "Now, maiden, before this wedding continues, whom will you have to husband?",
  "8532": "Why that word virtuous, said he, I pray you?",
  "8533": "What was it you did say to the archbishop?",
  "8534": "Is that letter for me?",
  "8535": "To set off to see her again?",
  "8536": "Ought I to be angry with her for being faithful to him?",
  "8537": "And the waiters, yea, and the inns at which they waited, and the cold rounds of beef inside, and the stunted ostler, with his blue nose and clinking pail, where is he, and where is his generation?",
  "8538": "Will not the reasons which indicate the propriety of this arrangement strongly plead for an admission of the other branch of that body to a share of the inquiry?",
  "8539": "Before I close may I say a few words upon two topics, much discussed out of doors, upon which it is highly important that our judgment should be clear, definite, and steadfast?",
  "8540": "What shall I do?",
  "8541": "What would you say, sir squire, to my having such a great natural instinct in judging wines that you have only to let me smell one and I can tell positively its country, its kind, its flavour and soundness, the changes it will undergo, and everything that appertains to a wine?",
  "8542": "Do you know this girl that your friend has made himself a fool about?",
  "8543": "I couldn't propose to her tonight, I suppose?",
  "8544": "Wasn't he sorry then?",
  "8545": "Did you get my hedgehog?",
  "8546": "And what would you do?",
  "8547": "Do you know that he loves YOU, yet?",
  "8548": "Whither so fast?",
  "8549": "You are wise women, aren't you?",
  "8550": "A pretty figure I'd be, wouldn't I, stuck behind that chap on a pillion?",

  "8552": "Sonya, what is the matter with you?",
  "8553": "Why should he die?",
  "8554": "Are you off?",
  "8555": "How like you him?",
  "8556": "Who, in the situation in which the world has placed me, has a right to require more at my hands?",
  "8557": "Why do you ask with such alarm?",
  "8558": "Where could he hope to find this powerful help?",
  "8559": "Will you come out with me?",
  "8560": "Who did that there?",
  "8561": "Why do you keep fidgeting, why don't you go to sleep?",
  "8562": "What would you that I should reply?",
  "8563": "And are you trying to keep it from me?",
  "8564": "Will you go to the ship in the boat?",
  "8565": "Does that satisfy you?",
  "8566": "The horrible punishment to which you have condemned me for the last six years?",

  "8571": "To make your will?",
  "8572": "What's the use of making mysteries?",
  "8573": "Do you take a middle course?",
  "8574": "And are you going to run away before you have fairly taught or learned whether they are true or not?",
  "8575": "Did you catch a glimpse of the towns on its borders?",
  "8576": "And pray what IS my position, madame?",
  "8577": "What has he against me?",
  "8578": "What can a fellow do with a fellow like that?",
  "8579": "Whence shall they come?",
  "8580": "Attentive?",
  "8581": "Are you in a great hurry?",
  "8582": "But that I feare?",
  "8583": "Corky around?",
  "8584": "Gone?",
  "8585": "Was I convinced of the truth of what I had heard?",
  "8586": "How would the papers talk about it?",

  "11384": "You find life pleasant, it is good to live, isn't it?",
  "11385": "Does any state actually make it a practice to treat its neighbor as itself?",
  "11386": "What do you most wish for?",
  "11387": "Somebody?",
  "11388": "May I know the others?",
  "11389": "If he did marry, how was he to live?",
  "11390": "How long were you engaged?",
  "11391": "Do they give you a free hand here?",
  "11392": "Well, gentlemen, are you determined to go on this cruise?",
  "11393": "Do YOU suppose this poor gentleman is out of his mind?",
  "11394": "Would you like, for the sake of clearness, to distinguish which are the necessary and which are the unnecessary pleasures?",
  "11395": "Why do you tremble so violently?",
  "11396": "Do you keep a dog?",
  "11397": "Am I wrong in saying, it is clear that we must live?",
  "11398": "And by whom is this order given?",
  "11399": "And your companions, where are they?",
  "11400": "And now what d' you expect?",
  "11401": "Could not something be made of this man under good influences?",
  "11402": "Oh, merciful heavens, was I not accessory to his death by my supine insensibility, by my contempt for him, not remembering, or not willing to remember, that it was for my sake he had become a traitor and a perjurer?",
  "11403": "And the royal and orderly desires are nearest?",
  "11404": "Say, then, is not pleasure opposed to pain?",
  "11405": "Why not sow all?",
  "11406": "What means thy speech?",
  "11407": "Who told you that?",
  "11408": "Complaint, sir?",
  "11409": "Mother?",
  "11410": "And would you call justice vice?",
  "11411": "But what am I to do if I love her?",
  "11412": "But what do I care for the laws of nature and arithmetic, when, for some reason I dislike those laws and the fact that twice two makes four?",
  "11413": "What was the nature of his apathy?",
  "11414": "But how in the name of wonder did you come here, and what have you been doing?",
  "11415": "Woodcourt?",
  "11416": "Should he force himself on this happiness?",
  "11417": "And which of his friends were with him?",
  "11418": "And what are its defences?",
  "11419": "Haven't you noticed if you are riding through a dark wood at night and see a little light shining ahead, how you forget your fatigue and the darkness and the sharp twigs that whip your face?",
  "11420": "You sold me a rapier, did you not?",
  "11421": "Why, what have I done amiss, my lord?",
  "11422": "But, what on earth is their meaning?",
  "11423": "What, the one as big as me?",
  "11424": "Aren't you worth something too?",
  "11425": "How was he to get out?",
  "11426": "Have you found your first day's work harder than you expected?",
  "11427": "And what was his object?",
  "11428": "It's you, is it?",
  "11429": "Wa'at did 'ee come here for, then?",
  "11430": "Have you heard of it, either of you?",
  "11431": "Ah, indeed?",
  "11432": "Because you are sorry to leave it?",
  "11433": "Shall we get into that boat, then, and push off?",
  "11434": "Madame, what shall I do with this linen fine?",
  "11435": "The whole of it?",
  "11436": "Didn't you ask me to come here?",
  "11437": "Even under this disguise?",
  "11438": "That I should plead their seuerall actions?",
  "11439": "Then you will appear?",
  "11440": "You never do anything at all to please me, do you, dear?",
  "11441": "Do you play?",
  "11442": "Not married after all?",
  "11443": "Whose but his own?",
  "11444": "You have formed a conclusion?",
  "11445": "Is not the exact opposite the truth?",
  "11446": "Why don't you consult my art?",
  "11447": "The other world?",
  "11448": "But where?",
  "11449": "Shall I call him by his name?",
  "11450": "How did you obtain these details?",
  "11451": "Do you live there?",
  "11452": "Isn't it the most beautiful county you ever saw?",
  "11453": "Hauskuld tells who he is, and asked what guests might be there in the house?",
  "11454": "Was it really true that all were dead?",
  "11455": "Why should he have taken to his heels?",
  "11456": "What more?",
  "11457": "But if it amused my father?",
  "11458": "And how long does it subsist?",
  "11459": "Then you are not in the habit of bolting your door every night before you get into bed?",
  "11460": "Will they forge you the sword of your deliverance, will they marshal you the army and lead it to the fray?",
  "11461": "My master had appetite enough three days ago, but what can one do?",
  "11462": "If so, that alone would hardly alter the matter, for what could she give in return?",
  "11463": "To leave you?",
  "11464": "Have you had a good journey?",
  "11465": "When was it ever otherwise?",
  "11466": "Do you know the impression your words give me?",
  "11467": "Is it, indeed, sir?",
  "11468": "Can you be ignorant that the council always act with moderation and respect towards ambassadors, but that the people are full of ambition and great designs?",
  "11469": "Do you wish me to tell you what to do with it?",
  "11470": "Why, sir?",
  "11471": "Have the suitors returned, or are they still waiting over yonder, to take me on my way home?",
  "11472": "Why should it not roll onwards, like the moon, a dark cold mass in space?",
  "11473": "Is it proper for men to say it and not for women?",
  "11474": "D'you want to go to bed already?",
  "11475": "And what is it that he wants?",
  "11476": "What are you afraid of?",
  "11477": "You are in a great hurry, then?",
  "11478": "Why don't you answer?",
  "11479": "What more can I tell you, dear?",
  "11480": "The relation between you and me, PAR EXEMPLE?",
  "11481": "How can we?",
  "11482": "Do you mind, dear?",
  "11483": "But he never brought light into anything quite so dark as this?",
  "11484": "But WHAT is worse?",
  "11485": "What time is it?",
  "11486": "Besides, she's only been a minister's wife for a little while, so one should make allowances, shouldn't they?",
  "11487": "Is it only the guilty whose honor is at the sport of others, sir?",
  "11488": "Ain't it there in his bed, for a clew, after he's gone?",
  "11489": "Do you know the best of gettin' ashore again?",
  "11490": "Don't you want to help me?",
  "11491": "And what do you think he was doing?",
  "11492": "What's one to do, my dear?",
  "11493": "And what shall I wear?",
  "11494": "What was she like?",
  "11495": "Why, there is not a function of a single organ in the body which has not been determined wholly and solely by experiment?",
  "11496": "You were just looking for an opportunity to throw me over and you took that one?",
  "11497": "What think ye that it is?",
  "11498": "The big house near the sea, you mean?",
  "11499": "Is it not the idea which is developed through it, the emotion with which it vibrates, which expands, elevates and ennobles it?",
  "11500": "All over?",
  "11501": "Is he going to die?",
  "11502": "My foundation laid on earth for a mansion in heaven?",
  "11503": "Shall one raging hand thus level all?",
  "11504": "What shall you do with him?",
  "11505": "Gluttony?",
  "11506": "What the deuce is the matter with him?",
  "11507": "Why should any one want to ask such questions, after an address like that?",
  "11508": "Is the authority of man over man just?",
  "11509": "Is he religious?",
  "11510": "Don't you know my voice?",
  "11511": "How much could I lose if things went wrong?",
  "11512": "On the west coast?",
  "11513": "What good do they do us?",
  "11514": "Where is reason?",
  "11515": "And what does it matter, now you're here to protect me?",
  "11516": "Who has occupied it the night before?",
  "11517": "Ten o'clock at night?",
  "11518": "The bottle must go somewhere, and why not here as well as anywhere else?",
  "11519": "Then the lover of wisdom has a great advantage over the lover of gain, for he has a double experience?",
  "11520": "What then, and how come you here?",
  "11521": "But where is the misfortune in this?",
  "11522": "See us looking, now, at you?",
  "11523": "What remedy can there be for this situation, but in a change of the system which has produced it in a change of the fallacious and delusive system of quotas and requisitions?",
  "11524": "Was it this that made her ill?",
  "11525": "Thy love is he?",
  "11526": "Excuse me, prince, but what are your arrangements?",
  "11527": "Do not whole scales of colors invisibly exist above and below the limits of our retinal sensibility?",
  "11528": "Have you ever had a difference with a dear friend?",
  "11529": "You came upon a private quarrel?",
  "11530": "Why shouldn't there be when a girl is, after all, all that she is?",
  "11531": "What, if the idea should come to him in his madness that it would be well for him to slay his wife and his children?",
  "11532": "Oh, fie, now shall I just tell you why you came here today?",
  "11533": "To whom is it degrading?",
  "11534": "Where are you lodging, monsieur?",
  "11535": "You don't think I planned it, do you?",
  "11536": "But did your reverence hear of the portent that was seen last night?",
  "11537": "What do you say to that show of sense?",
  "11538": "Do you accept the commission which I have intrusted to you?",
  "11539": "Have I forgotten myself so far that I have not even told you his name?",
  "11540": "What was to be done after the crowning of the king?",
  "11541": "Have you not got enough corn of your own?",
  "11542": "Is it your pleasure, most dear father, that you speak?",

  "11544": "The girl's name?",
  "11545": "And what have they promised?",
  "11546": "Mole?",
  "11547": "Did it do you any good?",
  "11548": "Which of your firm was it who called on me this morning?",
  "11549": "Can you get out?",
  "11550": "Have I to do with men of straw?",
  "11551": "Where was the monk going?",
  "11552": "Did we come up or down stream?",
  "11553": "The cave?",
  "11554": "Now should they undertake it immediately, and devote this day to it?",
  "11555": "Did the woman keep her oath?",
  "11556": "Why do you do this?",
  "11557": "But who can tell you the real truth of the matter?",
  "11558": "What solution will result later from these data?",
  "11559": "Then you were not merely jesting?",
  "11560": "How many and what dispositions were wanting to make 'em wise?",
  "11561": "But how had she learned?",
  "11562": "For their ransom?",
  "11563": "What else, sir?",
  "11564": "Is it entirely true that the vote has necessarily and really these inherent magical powers of rapid education for individuals and for classes of men, fitting them, in default of other qualifications, for the high responsibilities of suffrage?",
  "11565": "How, in short, reconcile what the progress already accomplished has had the effect of rendering irreconcilable?",
  "11566": "Is it a wreck?",

  "11602": "D'you know what sort of a practice this is?",
  "11603": "Ah, who, who?",
  "11604": "And therefore has neither more nor less of discord, nor yet of harmony?",
  "11605": "Let you be going down the markets, and what would you see for sale?",
  "11606": "And she had the right to live in your house and use your things?",
  "11607": "Pray where are their hens?",
  "11608": "Now, that is what he said, or to that purpose, was it not?",

  "11610": "Or what usually happens, in case any one refuses payment of this tribute?",
  "11611": "What doth it profit a man to gain the whole world if he suffer the loss of his immortal soul?",

  "11615": "Could I, if I knew which one to choose, keep only one for myself, and send the whole five of them for those poor children who haven't any?",
  "11616": "Do you lock yourself up from me, to make my search more curious?",
  "11617": "Now, did the dogs act thus from the experience of each individual, or from the example of the older and wiser dogs, or from an inherited habit, that is from instinct?",
  "11618": "Was it possible to make a fool of a man, of a worthy man, because his father had left him a little money?",
  "11619": "And a choice of what?",
  "11620": "Are you all right here?",
  "11621": "But what were these fatigues, what did the wounds matter?",
  "11622": "My business?",
  "11623": "What else do you hear?",
  "11624": "Not worth speaking of?",
  "11625": "Would the boat, however, resist more shocks of this kind?",
  "11626": "You will not fail me at the next term with the rest?",
  "11627": "Does not political economy itself teach you that the product of a man, whatever be his individual capacity, is never worth more than his labor, and that a man's labor is worth no more than his consumption?",
  "11628": "He brings his right arm up, jist across his face, and passes on, with a knowin nod of his head, as much as to say, how do you do?",

  "11642": "How should she know his parts?",
  "11643": "And you were saying, sire?",
  "11644": "Aren't we exchanging the substance for the shadow, aren't we forfeiting life for this dead quality of knowledge?",
  "11645": "But you, my dear d'Artagnan?",
  "11646": "Have you got your thick boots on, and something warm under your cloak?",
  "11647": "How could we bid them hither?",
  "11648": "Well, how about your case?",
  "11649": "Speak how?",
  "11650": "And is not life to be reckoned among the ends of the soul?",

  "11658": "Did she stand the journey well?",
  "11659": "Oh, he won't speak out, won't he?",
  "11660": "What's it to be?",
  "11661": "Or don't you want to tell it me?",
  "11662": "What business had she to go away?",
  "11663": "Why poor?",
  "11664": "But it had not approached the body?",
  "11665": "Where did you place it?",
  "11666": "Before the trial?",
  "11667": "My lord, you loue her?",

  "11688": "But, sir, are you sure he is as guilty as they say?",
  "11689": "From where does she hail?",
  "11690": "Further, I said, has not a drunken man also the spirit of a tyrant?",
  "11691": "Why do you, a stranger coming into my rooms at this time of the night, ask that question?",
  "11692": "What did they want from him?",
  "11693": "Who shall still appoint what shall be discoursed, what presumed, and no further?",
  "11694": "Haven't you experienced it?",

  "11755": "Go away with you?",
  "11756": "This is not your writing?",
  "11757": "For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?",

  "12963": "D'you want to quarrel with me?",
  "12964": "Do I counsel you to slay your instincts?",
  "12965": "Is the motive for this endeavour to be found in its speculative, or in its practical interests alone?",
  "12966": "Is there a touch of flunkeyism in this?",
  "12967": "Are you going to bed already?",
  "12968": "Have these men deceived us, and taken us back by another road?",
  "12969": "That all our swains commend her?",
  "12970": "Have I ever tried to chain you with an oath?",
  "12971": "You can direct us?",
  "12972": "Where are you going, my friend?",

  "13019": "What would you advise, then?",
  "13020": "Who, then?",
  "13021": "My dear, where did you get it?",
  "13022": "Perhaps it's the state of affairs?",
  "13023": "Was that not frightful?",
  "13024": "How dare you take it?",
  "13025": "Where?",
  "13026": "Well, where did you disappear to?",
  "13027": "And how did he get out?",
  "13028": "Where's my milk?",
  "13029": "But is it ever found?",
  "13030": "With me, sir?",

  "13036": "Took the cab on?",
  "13037": "Do you not love US, then?",
  "13038": "How do you get your provisions?",
  "13039": "Don't you think you can receive his evidence, sir?",
  "13040": "Oh, sir, I?",
  "13041": "What is the reason of this difference, but that immobility, not being natural to the hare, but the effect of industry, forms in that case a strong relation with the hunter, which is wanting in the other?",
  "13042": "Come, brave boys, are you resolved to go with me?",
  "13043": "And how do you know her?",
  "13044": "Will she go with me?",
  "13045": "I suppose you fall asleep wherever you sit down?",
  "13046": "What a collusion is this, whenas we are exhorted by the wise man to use diligence, to seek for wisdom as for hidden treasures early and late, that another order shall enjoin us to know nothing but by statute?",
  "13047": "Aren't you going to shake hands with me?",

  "13054": "Or was it that you had completed your term of life?",
  "13055": "PIGS' TEETH?",
  "13056": "And what is the result of your investigations?",
  "13057": "Not a word of reproach?",
  "13058": "And, if not, whence arises this culpability peculiar to man?",
  "13059": "But how?",
  "13060": "Was this difficult?",
  "13061": "Then I can still count on your support?",
  "13062": "Does it mean that it's the real thing?",
  "13063": "Who has his letters?",
  "13064": "Ay, are you howling, you wolf?",
  "13065": "Did I?",
  "13066": "Why all this ado?",
  "13067": "I wonder who she can be?",
  "13068": "But if it's something you can't find out, isn't it as good as if it were nothing?",
  "13069": "They still come?",

  "13073": "Before we begin to descend the cliff, you shall creep down to the hut, as noiselessly as possible, and ascertain if the traitor royalists are there?",
  "13074": "What art is that?",
  "13075": "And will he then change himself for the better and fairer, or for the worse and more unsightly?",
  "13076": "And what is the whole history?",
  "13077": "The noose, sir?",
  "13078": "Said I, and how, my lad?",
  "13079": "And how did you get your clue?",
  "13080": "What is the matter with you?",
  "13081": "How in the name of all that is reasonable can we find out the exact nature of a spiritual malady, unless we have had experience of other similar cases?",
  "13082": "How should they?",
  "13083": "Whatever's the matter now?",
  "13084": "Is it illusion or fear?",

  "13095": "You're not in earnest?",
  "13096": "Why did we meet at that fatal woman's house?",
  "13097": "How do you do, my dear boy?",
  "13098": "I'll go up onto the knoll if I may?",
  "13099": "And why doesn't he die, I should like to know?",
  "13100": "And did they repeat what you said?",
  "13101": "Why do you conceal your necessities from me?",
  "13102": "And how do YOU know that he left two million and a half of roubles?",
  "13103": "Do you know if the marriage settlement he promised me has come?",
  "13104": "Now, I ask, why was all this done, but from that extremely weak and expensive doctrine, that the country could not bear it?",
  "13105": "Don't I?",
  "13106": "Sturgis?",
  "13107": "And where mought you have come from?",
  "13108": "Shall I never be rid of you?",
  "13109": "What are you going to do with me?",
  "13110": "In the hospital, do you say?",
  "13111": "And in estimating the men too, may I not fairly make a like request, that I should have a judge whose mind can enter into and see through human nature?",
  "13112": "Tell me, what is it?",
  "13113": "IF NOT, WHY NOT?",
  "13114": "How could he have made such a mistake?",
  "13115": "Upon what grounds may I ask?",

  "13125": "And what will she do now?",
  "13126": "Worse news of what, of whom?",
  "13127": "How could it have been possible?",
  "13128": "In what way did people imagine that they could procure so many goods or avoid so many ills by the application of fire and smoke, of embers and ashes?",
  "13129": "Is it an illusion?",

  "13131": "Do you know that profound thinker?",
  "13132": "To whom does this island belong?",
  "13133": "Isn't that rather a large order?",

  "13145": "He's keeping you waiting, isn't he?",
  "13146": "Well then, how you going to find the marks?",
  "13147": "But there's no hurry, is there?",

  "13157": "Has not everything been settled again and again to your satisfaction?",
  "13158": "Do your sisters play and sing?",
  "13159": "Five full casks?",
  "13160": "Are you not thirsty?",
  "13161": "By what right?",
  "13162": "It's very wrong of me, isn't it?",
  "13163": "But why need we seek for other arguments to prove, that a present impression with a relation or transition of the fancy may inliven any idea, when this very instance of our reasonings from cause and effect will alone suffice to that purpose?",

  "13172": "How so, general?",
  "13173": "Your majesty is in a hurry, then?",
  "13174": "Was he not now free from all the anxieties and worries of politics?",
  "13175": "Is he not dead?",

  "13188": "Have you seen him, to your certain knowledge, before?",
  "13189": "Do you think that I should undertake this holy office?",
  "13190": "And suppose I disregard your opinion as you disregard mine?",
  "13191": "Or was there, as it rather seemed, a circle of ominous shadow moving along with his deformity whichever way he turned himself?",
  "13192": "What will you say?",
  "13193": "Why is it you have never married?",
  "13194": "But will it not be lost?",
  "13195": "For what?",
  "13196": "Ah, if only I were a man?",

  "14096": "Ain't thinkin' it'll hurt my digestion?",
  "14097": "Why do you stand gaping there?",
  "14098": "Was it a wire or a mathematical line?",
  "14099": "Where are you off to so early?",
  "14100": "Isn't it enough to make a man crusty to see that little sprawler put up in the best business every night, and actually keeping money out of the house, by being forced down the people's throats, while other people are passed over?",
  "14101": "Are you going far in this condition?",
  "14102": "From hence how far?",
  "14103": "Wasn't that good of him?",

  "14139": "Not come after all I've said?",
  "14140": "May we rely upon your consent?",
  "14141": "Is not this a clear sign of my ruin?",
  "14142": "Doesn't he have enough?",
  "14143": "Did he at all know where he wanted to live?",
  "14144": "And the drawers?",
  "14145": "Was she speaking thus seriously?",
  "14146": "Do you think I am deceived as to the flagrant impropriety of my conduct?",

  "14157": "Shall you, thus armed with bladders vile, attack my title, eminence, and pomp sublime?",
  "14158": "How many children?",
  "14159": "You know me, do you?",
  "14160": "And does not motherhood mean a vaster nation of brave sons and of gentle daughters, who, in their turn, will give us sons and daughters of their own?",

  "14225": "You didn't love me before?",
  "14226": "Who dares to say the contrary?",
  "14227": "But when he was looking to the front what, or how many whats, could be staring at him from the back?",
  "14228": "And I might not go with him?",
  "14229": "Was it by the scrupulous and inflexible justice of all his undertakings, by the immense dangers and difficulties with which they were attended, or by the unwearied and unrelenting application with which he pursued them?",
  "14230": "And why not, mother?",
  "14231": "Do you not see a mass which seems to move?",

  "14290": "I wonder why it is that to lie securely in bed, with the light out, seems ever the same place, wherever in space one may chance to be?",
  "14291": "How the better?",
  "14292": "That's not much, is it?",
  "14293": "Where is the chief of the cohort?",

  "14438": "Why should he doubt it?",
  "14439": "What have YOU got to do with it, then, if a person may inquire?",
  "14440": "And you can't say I've not been awfully good, can you?",
  "14441": "And the opinion of the inquisitors?",
  "14442": "Why so many to be low and so few to be high?",
  "14443": "But what is there in running across it like that?",

  "14837": "You don't mean the infant phenomenon?",
  "14838": "But who ever reflects that, for certain boys, an unjust imposition may be as great a pang as the death of a friend in later years?",
  "14839": "Spirit, are they yours?",
  "14840": "What difference is it to you?",
  "14841": "Would you have voted what you felt and knew to be a lie?",
  "14842": "Was it climate?",

  "14844": "Did she ride the horse?",
  "14845": "Do you say so, miss?",
  "14846": "But, in the first place, how did he manage to enter the convent?",
  "14847": "Are they hoping with our help to triumph over their foes or to be useful to their friends?",
  "14848": "Who fears the fallen dew?",
  "14849": "What counterbalance?",
  "14850": "Why, you did nothing wrong?",
  "14851": "If you know, why don't you tell?",
  "14852": "Aren't you but fifteen?",
  "14853": "Will you permit me, then, to recall another to you?",
  "14854": "Where is your native isle?",
  "14855": "Why aren't you asleep, sir?",
  "14856": "You will not sell it, will you?",
  "14857": "My dearest girl, what is the matter?",
  "14858": "In what respect?",
  "14859": "Maylie?",
  "14860": "Why were the holy relics, the arms, ammunition, gunpowder, and stores of corn not removed?",
  "14861": "How long has he been away?",
  "14862": "And dogs are deteriorated in the good qualities of dogs, and not of horses?",
  "14863": "How do you know that it was the same fiacre?",
  "14864": "But to whom did you say them?",
  "14865": "But if, now, a disaster were to happen?",
  "14866": "May not the darkness hide it from my face?",
  "14867": "Now, have a turn with me?",
  "14868": "And you do not guess it?",
  "14869": "Why can't I see in the dark?",
  "14870": "Will it never be day?",
  "14871": "O, then, you are in love with him?",
  "14872": "What sort of a face was I to draw?",
  "14873": "Can you believe so?",
  "14874": "Who made this man my master?",
  "14875": "Why should he have pardoned me, then?",
  "14876": "That is so, is it not?",
  "14877": "How has he got rich?",
  "14878": "What more of the man she had told them of before?",
  "14879": "What can all this mean?",
  "14880": "And when a beautiful soul harmonises with a beautiful form, and the two are cast in one mould, that will be the fairest of sights to him who has an eye to see it?",
  "14881": "Of what use would it be?",
  "14882": "It's natural and right for 'em to talk different from each other, ain't it?",
  "14883": "Is it not then strange that thy intelligent part only should be disobedient and discontented with its own place?",
  "14884": "Which are the best coasts?",
  "14885": "You wish to join the colony?",
  "14886": "Was it not his betrothal feast?",
  "14887": "Are you not the precious image of each and all of us men in this whaling world?",
  "14888": "It don't take long, does it?",
  "14889": "Will you always stand that way and wait, until it'll becomes morning, noon, and evening?",
  "14890": "Now, you will go, won't you?",
  "14891": "And when the whole soul follows the philosophical principle, and there is no division, the several parts are just, and do each of them their own business, and enjoy severally the best and truest pleasures of which they are capable?",
  "14892": "May I ask the reason of your refusal?",
  "14893": "Does he know where I am, aunt?",
  "14894": "Have you anything?",
  "14895": "What liquor?",
  "14896": "Eh, how can I tell?",
  "14897": "What would he think himself?",
  "14898": "Did he understand too well, or did he not understand at all?",
  "14899": "When will you stop such romping ways?",
  "14900": "Who has not?",
  "14901": "Don't you think that any secret course is an unworthy one?",
  "14902": "And what have you been bringing here?",
  "14903": "Are the others clever, sir?",
  "14904": "Why should he run wild upon the moor?",
  "14905": "What they DO doesn't alter the truth of what they say, does it?",
  "14906": "Is it because it is his duty to be grateful?",
  "14907": "Have you put him to any ransom?",
  "14908": "Charlotte?",
  "14909": "What do you make of them?",
  "14910": "Would you be asking me to break my oath?",
  "14911": "Is there nothing I can do?",
  "14912": "Why don't you go home, then, same's me?",
  "14913": "What was this strange house?",
  "14914": "Do you not go with us?",
  "14915": "Think we're as green as to do you in here, and have the police nosing round?",
  "14916": "Taken in by the servant?",
  "14917": "What will become of us?",
  "14918": "D'you understand?",
  "14919": "Or what theory of morals can ever serve any useful purpose, unless it can show, by a particular detail, that all the duties which it recommends, are also the true interest of each individual?",
  "14920": "And these researches?",
  "14921": "Is it some former admirer who wishes to retire?",
  "14922": "And you fancy that the two matters are connected in some way?",
  "14923": "You'll come with me, won't you?",
  "14924": "Your father, or brother, or your betrothed?",
  "14925": "When do you go, sir?",
  "14926": "What if the boy were really not her son, after all?",
  "14927": "Who are you, pray ?",
  "14928": "Well, granting that, what became of him?",
  "14929": "What put that idea in your head?",
  "14930": "Why did you not put your name to the note?",
  "14931": "He has been fairly in?",
  "14932": "Could you get me a part if I paid?",
  "14933": "What is the time now?",
  "14934": "Where do you go?",

  "14936": "Oh, will you really?",
  "14937": "Who is the gentleman with the telescope?",
  "14938": "Why, indeed?",
  "14939": "That is his meaning then?",
  "14940": "And 'What will you take for the geese?",
  "14941": "Promise not to repeat?",
  "14942": "Are ye tuck sick, or what's come over ye?",
  "14943": "Tell me, why does a steward rob his master?",
  "14944": "Have you no regard for true merit, you malignant fellow?",
  "14945": "And last night he was with us so happy, so cheerful, so affectionate?",
  "14946": "It is not all a question of goods?",
  "14947": "Therefore is my freedom lawful, however proper it may be?",
  "14948": "Were they swept into eternity by a freshet?",
  "14949": "Besides, where was I to find a person to write the words, and one who would give himself the trouble of turning the poetry to my liking?",
  "14950": "Is it in any way different from other schools?",
  "14951": "And what harm if he did talk?",
  "14952": "Us, who have wings and fly?",
  "14953": "A grey mare?",
  "14954": "By the way, have you by any chance an aunt, a cousin, a grandmother, or any other suitable female relation who might be represented as being likely to kick the bucket?",
  "14955": "What effect had this frightful shock produced?",
  "14956": "And he acquiesced?",
  "14957": "So you would advise a knife to his throat?",
  "14958": "How dare you touch that coronet?",
  "14959": "Can't you make it eight?",
  "14960": "What has been decided?",
  "14961": "My dear girl, what have I got to do with her dressing beautifully or looking well?",
  "14962": "Are you speaking seriously, doctor?",
  "14963": "How could that be?",
  "14964": "My companions and myself?",
  "14965": "Do we breakfast or dine?",
  "14966": "Ought any, then, to refuse their aid in doing what good the good of the whole demands?",
  "14967": "Would the stranger one day speak of it?",
  "14968": "What may my father wish to convey?",
  "14969": "At the rate of, sir?",
  "14970": "When did you say he died?",
  "14971": "Well, when is her birthday?",
  "14972": "Is there any political power to authorize such interference?",
  "14973": "Now do you understand?",
  "14974": "And it was she, I presume, who mentioned your name?",
  "14975": "Is that where you live, my little lady?",
  "14976": "Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it?",
  "14977": "Where d' you live, sir?",
  "14978": "Are you come out as against a thief, with swords and staves to take me?",
  "14979": "Do you repent?",
  "14980": "Is the water always turbid?",
  "14981": "Was there nothing to be done?",

  "14983": "Well, what is it you really want of me?",
  "14984": "Who shall be the judge of merit?",
  "14985": "How now, nephew?",

  "14988": "Well, what are the names of the patriarchs?",
  "14989": "Have I clearly explained the class which I mean?",
  "14990": "Where can he have been hidden?",
  "14991": "Where did you bring him from?",
  "14992": "How can your lordship imagine that you could ever inconvenience me?",
  "14993": "How did you come here?",
  "14994": "I suppose he never knew me?",
  "14995": "Why did you drive me to such extremities?",
  "14996": "But why should such an idea cross your mind?",
  "14997": "You couldn't take me, could you?",
  "14998": "But how are we to come by the men?",
  "14999": "What can I fear while shielded by protection at once so loving and so powerful?",
  "15000": "When was I in a fearful state?",
  "15001": "Shall I commit adultery?",
  "15002": "What has become of him?",
  "15003": "What right have we then to expect the perpetual entail on any family of an exquisite discretion, which if it be not a sort of genius, is at least as rare as genius?",
  "15004": "In that case, monseigneur, do you believe the cardinal will be so kind as to tell me what has become of my wife?",
  "15005": "Can he be sure that the two are necessarily in accord?",
  "15006": "Was there no mention made of me in the letter?",
  "15007": "Are not these beggarly devils sufficiently wretched already?",
  "15008": "Were you ever at sea, before?",
  "15009": "But what did you mean to take?",
  "15010": "Have strangers leave with us to get their wealth?",
  "15011": "If she bleeds to death, is that my fault?",
  "15012": "You are going to leave us after I have become so accustomed to you?",
  "15013": "Can it be done?",
  "15014": "Is she your child?",
  "15015": "What if by endeavouring to place her in the position of a lady, he had falsely so placed her, and robbed her of her legitimate position?",
  "15016": "Am I come to a friend?",
  "15017": "What befals him dead?",
  "15018": "Which way heading?",
  "15019": "Then what shall I gain, pray?",
  "15020": "How do you suppose you can carry on like this?",
  "15021": "Whose service would that be?",
  "15022": "What does all this flight of imagination mean?",
  "15023": "Vansuythen?",
  "15024": "What in the world do you s'pose that is?",
  "15025": "Is our little neighbor worse?",
  "15026": "Where have I been brought to?",
  "15027": "Nor the blue bed?",
  "15028": "My good sir, what is the matter with you, O father?",
  "15029": "How long will it be first?",
  "15030": "Why has she given up sending the children and coming to see us?",
  "15031": "Who is this?",
  "15032": "Is dat you, honey?",
  "15033": "Garth?",
  "15034": "Where do your brothers and sisters live?",
  "15035": "How can I take this stranger into my house?",
  "15036": "Then don't you know how it was?",
  "15037": "Who is it you wish to see?",
  "15038": "Why is it that she speaks to him of about your welfare and your position, as she clearly has done?",
  "15039": "How will that do?",
  "15040": "But why shall I say more?",
  "15041": "I wonder if you will forgive me?",
  "15042": "But with what object?",
  "15043": "Where is the girl?",
  "15044": "You imagined I didn't know you had your watch again?",
  "15045": "And what kind of woman, and of what age is she?",
  "15046": "Prunes?",
  "15047": "How came you to be there?",
  "15048": "And where might it be now?",
  "15049": "Now, how on earth could you know that the stolen silver was at the bottom of that pond?",
  "15050": "There are no villages here?",
  "15051": "What at?",
  "15052": "Something that you would like done, is it not?",
  "15053": "Was that all?",
  "15054": "Will you not let me look at it also?",
  "15055": "And are things in order?",
  "15056": "How about the fireplace?",
  "15057": "Why, what is the matter?",
  "15058": "And what did you say?",
  "15059": "Who is right and who is wrong?",
  "15060": "Next, we shall ask our opponent how, in reference to any of the pursuits or arts of civic life, the nature of a woman differs from that of a man?",
  "15061": "But if a man had a danger hanging over him, and knew what it was, don't you think he would turn to the police for protection?",
  "15062": "How did it show itself?",
  "15063": "When is this accomplished?",
  "15064": "And have you them yet?",
  "15065": "Did I take this yesterday?",
  "15066": "Will any private training enable him to stand firm against the overwhelming flood of popular opinion?",
  "15067": "Why would ye let such beauty wither?",
  "15068": "What may YOUR game be, ma'am?",
  "15069": "But what does it show?",
  "15070": "Or hear, except with the ear?",
  "15071": "What is the wind?",
  "15072": "It wasn't your fault so why should you mind?",
  "15073": "What must I answer?",
  "15074": "Is there any talk yet of who is to run?",
  "15075": "Must it be so?",
  "15076": "But what can we do?",
  "15077": "Why did you push yourself in there by daylight?",
  "15078": "And does not marriage mean motherhood?",
  "15079": "Don't you belong to the barricade?",
  "15080": "And what do you suppose the master will think when I display it before him?",
  "15081": "Hand over, will you?",
  "15082": "And think there was to you no conscience of the housebreaker, what would you do?",
  "15083": "What is it that you will not do?",
  "15084": "And whither go we, my father?",
  "15085": "What vault?",
  "15086": "By asking advice instead of exerting the judgment?",
  "15087": "The question naturally arises, how is it that in these latter cases the winter plumage of both sexes, and in the former cases the plumage of the adult females, as well as the immature plumage of the young, have not been at all affected?",
  "15088": "Another one, eh?",
  "15089": "Who are they that carry it?",
  "15090": "For what can be the meaning of a truly wise man wanting to fly away and lightly leave a master who is better than himself?",
  "15091": "You think, probably, that I roam around, and get into all sorts of evil?",
  "15092": "Why weren't you at the races yesterday?",
  "15093": "But fly whither?",
  "15094": "May it be that I see you?",
  "15095": "Yes, count, you know what I told you?",
  "15096": "And what kind of a man?",
  "15097": "Have you heard what has happened?",
  "15098": "Does the king exile me?",
  "15099": "And who is that pale young man beside him?",
  "15100": "Yes, isn't it, dear?",
  "15101": "What more need be said?",
  "15102": "Will no danger threaten him?",
  "15103": "How can you reconcile it to your conscience, I wonder, to prejudice my own boy against me, or against anybody who is dear to me?",
  "15104": "Nor of any other such person?",
  "15105": "Will your excellency deign to open it?",
  "15106": "Who amongst us is there that does not recollect similar hours of bitter, bitter childish grief?",
  "15107": "What had he really gained by all this trouble?",
  "15108": "And what was his reply?",
  "15109": "Shall I row you ashore?",
  "15110": "Have I been talking in my sleep?",
  "15111": "Where now?",
  "15112": "The beginning or the end?",
  "15113": "Indeed, where could we stop?",
  "15114": "Wasn't it a lovely place?",
  "15115": "He is dead, is he not?",
  "15116": "The name of my clerk?",
  "15117": "Will you call for the money, or shall I send it?",
  "15118": "But how to get rid of him?",
  "15119": "Who's going?",
  "15120": "How is the queen?",
  "15121": "So you refuse my request?",
  "15122": "You wonder what?",
  "15123": "And who is that other person?",
  "15124": "Rheumatism, sir?",
  "15125": "Am I my brother's keeper?",
  "15126": "What do you mean by early?",
  "15127": "Would they be likely to get rid of seven men out of eight from their own gang and retain only the eighth man?",
  "15128": "You will go to the city and make money, eh?",
  "15129": "Do you think he had planned this robbery, when he went with you to the lodging?",
  "15130": "O, is your bundle ready?",
  "15131": "It was a cunning device, for, apart from the chance of driving your victim to his death, what peasant would venture to inquire too closely into such a creature should he get sight of it, as many have done, upon the moor?",
  "15132": "Real friends?",
  "15133": "Will you never get on to your job?",
  "15134": "And about what?",
  "15135": "You owe her her wages, I suppose?",
  "15136": "Do you know what you have said?",
  "15137": "Balderstone?",
  "15138": "I am having a room got ready for you here, and will you please come round at once on getting this?",
  "15139": "But we owe something in this house?",
  "15140": "And what about afterwards?",
  "15141": "But where will we be tomorrow?",
  "15142": "What advice?",
  "15143": "Who told her?",
  "15144": "Remarkable for what?",
  "15145": "Is it not what happens to every one?",
  "15146": "But how is it she does not think of it herself?",
  "15147": "Who may it be for?",
  "15148": "I say, laddie, you don't object if I sing slightly from time to time during the journey?",
  "15149": "What makes you weep, mama?",
  "15150": "Where is his office?",
  "15151": "What do you mean by that question?",
  "15152": "If this is the great evil of being alone, then what is good and what is evil?",
  "15153": "Have you any arms?",
  "15154": "Are they in possession of our letters?",
  "15155": "Do you observe this gallery, or rather lobby, indeed?",
  "15156": "When will you do that?",
  "15157": "And will not the words and the character of the style depend on the temper of the soul?",
  "15158": "Do you not think that it would be regrettable if we had met in vain?",
  "15159": "Why did she come?",
  "15160": "Is it not safe e'en to encounter him?",
  "15161": "Did any haberdasher ever look so smirking?",
  "15162": "But what degree of intensity will overbalance what period of duration?",
  "15163": "Couldn't we enlarge it, hollow it out, make openings to let in light and air?",
  "15164": "How can I desire children?",
  "15165": "Would I only come and look at the range?",
  "15166": "What is the prisoner's name?",
  "15167": "Well, hasn't it made it exactly what we wanted?",
  "15168": "Will you take up our ivory and return in peace to our village, or shall we follow along your trail toward the north as we have followed for the past three days?",
  "15169": "How can there be any secrecy, when everything is known to all of us?",
  "15170": "You won't carry me off in your bags, will ye, master?",
  "15171": "Where is your master's diocese?",
  "15172": "Why did he so?",
  "15173": "What was it, my own mother?",
  "15174": "But when you held her in your power, why did you not drown her, strangle her, hang her?",
  "15175": "But by whom will Z be paid for the loss caused him by the profit charged by A in the beginning?",
  "15176": "Perhaps, sir, you don't like the ship?",
  "15177": "Do you think I'd let him imagine for a minute that anything he said could influence me in my public duty?",
  "15178": "Is she safe?",
  "15179": "Have I offended you?",
  "15180": "Then you are on guard every day?",
  "15181": "But this castle, then?",
  "15182": "You know him, then?",
  "15183": "What, said he, I wonder, will the good old couple say to it?",
  "15184": "My hand?",
  "15185": "Now, what change does the idea of value undergo when we rise from the contradictory notions of useful value and exchangeable value to that of constituted value or absolute value?",
  "15186": "You consider it, then, perfectly unworthy of a woman to love a man who does not adore her?",
  "15187": "Why are you upset?",
  "15188": "Have you anything to ask of me?",
  "15189": "I've accepted your dismissal, and you managed it as cruelly as you could, and I have made you respect my sex, haven't I?",
  "15190": "What must I do?",
  "15191": "You have formed some conclusion?",
  "15192": "Was not the observation of the chief only what might have been expected?",
  "15193": "What right have I to betray the confidence reposed in me, when nothing but a miracle can prevent this sacrifice?",
  "15194": "Can't you be generous and unselfish enough to face whatever trial there may be for you in this bit of a coincidence?",
  "15195": "How did she come there?",
  "15196": "Now, don't you think the lad would be handsomer cropped?",
  "15197": "Who could have told that such a hurricane had been let loose on the surface of that ocean?",
  "15198": "What is the result at present?",
  "15199": "Were you never taught to say your prayers?",
  "15200": "Well, said he, who next?",
  "15201": "But what if he were mistaken in his views, and there were no necessity that his own absolute separation from her should be involved in the incident of her marriage?",
  "15202": "Is it suppression?",
  "15203": "Then they will quarrel as those who intend some day to be reconciled?",
  "15204": "Where is the pain?",
  "15205": "Why did you take the axe along?",
  "15206": "How was it done?",
  "15207": "And why are you all alone?",
  "15208": "The scene which followed, who can describe?",
  "15209": "Where would you have been, my dear, if I hadn't meddled with YOU?",
  "15210": "Where does he expect me to get it?",
  "15211": "Did you call, sir?",
  "15212": "Where, then, is your enthusiasm?",
  "15213": "Do you wish it?",
  "15214": "Do you really think so, doctor?",
  "15215": "Oh, is that all?",

  "15613": "What, monseigneur, do you not know me?",
  "15614": "Do you know what 'column left' means?",
  "15615": "What does it matter to me?",
  "15616": "Yet how long would a people remain so, in such a country?",
  "15617": "The heathen temple, you mean?",
  "15618": "A hero's boasted fame?",
  "15619": "And that I intended to ask her to be my wife?",
  "15620": "When she told you you would be a judge?",
  "15621": "Would ye be the next to be whipped with switches?",
  "15622": "What am I to do with him?",
  "15623": "You say he is going to speak with me this evening?",
  "15624": "You have not found him?",
  "15625": "For long?",
  "15626": "Would it make my happy that you should be a prisoner here for ever?",
  "15627": "Have you had no accident?",
  "15628": "Who's the best shot?",
  "15629": "Why, dear child, what has made your poor little heart so sad?",
  "15630": "You mean she'll make it out her own fault?",
  "15631": "But why don't you want me to go with them?",
  "15632": "Is there anything else?",
  "15633": "And if she had been dissolved into earth, or worse, what would you have dreamt of then?",
  "15634": "Has he got wind of some host approaching, and does he wish to warn us, or would he speak upon some other matter of public moment?",
  "15635": "If we're lads, what does he call himself?",
  "15636": "Why threepence?",
  "15637": "But do you care about them?",
  "15638": "I now know you are all right, and what can I wish for more?",
  "15639": "But if this indemnity is refused me, what do I, a proletaire, care for the tranquillity and security of the rich?",
  "15640": "Why may not our country at some time average as many?",
  "15641": "What is thy news?",
  "15642": "Does it hurt?",
  "15643": "And what, after all, is the security which this training gives to governments?",
  "15644": "Now what are you going to do?",
  "15645": "Don't you know that it is wicked to do so?",
  "15646": "How was what done?",
  "15647": "Do you know it?",
  "15648": "Now was she to begin?",
  "15649": "And understand them?",
  "15650": "What could her heart want more, better, more beautiful, more rich than such a love as this?",
  "15651": "Now how did this odious stigma originate?",
  "15652": "And who will weigh it for you?",
  "15653": "You can talk as you eat, can't you?",
  "15654": "Does any one know?",
  "15655": "What settlement is he to make?",
  "15656": "How could I be that?",
  "15657": "You know my studio at the top of the house?",
  "15658": "How far might you call yourselves from the marshes, hereabouts?",
  "15659": "So I think that looks pretty good, don't you?",
  "15660": "He being the heir?",
  "15661": "Thomas, you have returned, then, and your first act is again an indiscretion and a piece of foolhardy rashness?",
  "15662": "What caused it?",
  "15663": "How then could I unite with this wild idolator in worshipping his piece of wood?",
  "15664": "Have not some of the intriguers put it into his head that I regard him with jealousy?",
  "15665": "Knowing all, how could she be drawn back under the man's fascination?",
  "15666": "On what mischief was the young fiend bent now?",
  "15667": "I hope he's not vicious?",
  "15668": "In his glance?",
  "15669": "Who will go and cut wood in the forest?",
  "15670": "What, has he purchased arms, then?",
  "15671": "Now, what is the value of this product?",
  "15672": "Will you?",
  "15673": "Because we are bidden to feast with them, because we are bidden to rejoice with them, because we are bidden to play the lute with them, because we are bidden to dance with them?",
  "15674": "Yes, well?",
  "15675": "And why did you refuse, my son?",
  "15676": "Is that what they think of relationships nowadays?",
  "15677": "Why did I do that?",
  "15678": "Then you have some other motive unknown to us?",
  "15679": "Old?",
  "15680": "Then you would infer that opinion is intermediate?",
  "15681": "What other course was left to take?",
  "15682": "If the dream is not the same as the things dreamed, in what other form does it appear to you?",
  "15683": "Don't I generly know what I'm about?",
  "15684": "Are you traders, or do you sail the sea as rovers, with your hands against every man, and every man's hand against you?",
  "15685": "Do you not know it?",
  "15686": "But have you not received my notes?",
  "15687": "Are the preparations for the games complete?",
  "15688": "Where do you wish me to go, madame?",
  "15689": "And who may this be?",
  "15690": "What if she's marrying me simply to be married?",
  "15691": "Which way?",
  "15692": "What about them?",
  "15693": "Would you like to know the opinion of a chronicler of the fourteenth century?",
  "15694": "Well, is he?",
  "15695": "What shall we do?",
  "15696": "Can't get your mind off of frankfurters, can you?",
  "15697": "Should he abandon his friends who were expecting him?",
  "15698": "Fine day, ain't it?",
  "15699": "Why didn't you tell her of her danger?",
  "15700": "Clever?",
  "15701": "And when's the wedding to be?",
  "15702": "What is all that about?",
  "15703": "For of what other common political community will any one say that the whole human race are members?",
  "15704": "When we had walked about a mile by moonlight, we perceived a horseman behind us, who coming up, wished us good even, and asked which way we went?",
  "15705": "Now, then, what did you do to your hair?",
  "15706": "Why do you pish, captain?",
  "15707": "And what would be the use of behaving otherwise?",
  "15708": "Isn't that shameful, isn't that humiliating?",
  "15709": "Cousin, will you any tobacco?",
  "15710": "Why not think much about this mansion?",
  "15711": "Is it his child?",
  "15712": "How do you say it?",
  "15713": "Who's been telling you that?",
  "15714": "How like you this?",
  "15715": "Have you got a pistol?",
  "15716": "Then the cowardly and mean nature has no part in true philosophy?",
  "15717": "Doesn't it lie by the door in the morning when your mistress begins the work of the day?",
  "15718": "That you believe there's nothing I'm afraid of?",
  "15719": "Now are you content?",
  "15720": "Three what?",
  "15721": "What is there in heaven or on earth which it does not embrace, and with so much facility, with so much gracefulness, as if there were scarcely an effort in it, or as if self was charmed away, and might not mingle to distract it?",
  "15722": "Is it really only negative?",
  "15723": "HIS father?",
  "15724": "Of what sort could a woman be who wrote such a letter as that?",
  "15725": "You acknowledge that as your conviction on the subject?",
  "15726": "And why should I?",
  "15727": "Diamonds on de moon, eh?",
  "15728": "And is it just to assail, condemn, or despise them for doing so?",
  "15729": "Could her mother own it if she did?",
  "15730": "Now, can you?",
  "15731": "Well, what is there so astonishing in that?",

  "15775": "Why need we pay it?",
  "15776": "D'you know what that means?",
  "15777": "Well, how does our friend look at it?",
  "15778": "Yet who will deny that the imagination and understanding have made many, very many discoveries since those days, which only seem harbingers of others still more noble and beneficial?",

  "15792": "Where shall I ever find a friend, when these three are my enemies, belonging to me, yet putting me to death?",
  "15793": "Besides, what is danger in comparison with the right?",
  "15794": "How is it, then, I repeat, that a wholly external accident has changed the nature of man, which is supposed to be good and gentle and social?",
  "15795": "Surely not, and why is it that they are not willing, as they formerly were willing, to sacrifice the interests of their country to the interests of their religious persuasion?",
  "15796": "Then when am I to have it?",
  "15797": "I may sacrifice my soul, but what matters it?",

  "15840": "And what is evil?",
  "15841": "Or make pale my cheeks with care 'Cause another's rosy are?",
  "15842": "For to what end should the sun impart unto her any of his light?",
  "15843": "And you, a trained man of science, believe it to be supernatural?",

  "15928": "Now, isn't he?",
  "15929": "Who do you think that couple is?",
  "15930": "You think, gentlemen, perhaps that I am mad?",
  "15931": "French, if I don't mistake?",
  "15932": "Who is there, in the official world, that conceives the necessity and therefore the possibility of such a reconciliation?",
  "15933": "An arrest?",

  "16004": "You see this toothpick?",
  "16005": "You would like a glass of lemonade, sir?",
  "16006": "Do you want the tuileries?",
  "16007": "What was their sole remaining chance?",
  "16008": "Well, what does your instinct tell you now?",
  "16009": "There is no possibility of any mistake on your part, my boy, is there?",
  "16010": "Do you think I can wait when business is in question?",
  "16011": "Is your profession really so engaging and interesting as to absorb your whole attention?",
  "16012": "How do you do, sir?",
  "16013": "Why couldn't we have waited?",
  "16014": "Shivering?",
  "16015": "Did she, too, pine for the lost rank, or rather mourn the lost lover?",
  "16016": "Perhaps you are his spirit come to revisit your old home?",
  "16017": "Is the young lady not with her aunt, after all?",
  "16018": "Why had these men come back after having returned to the camp?",

  "16020": "But how does my sweet girl?",
  "16021": "Do you know what passed when I took him aside?",
  "16022": "Ah, how do you do, my dear prince?",
  "16023": "Of what do you complain?",
  "16024": "What if there WAS some one concealed in the house?",
  "16025": "You are her grandfather, that is?",

  "16029": "Has she, indeed?",
  "16030": "Laziness?",
  "16031": "You'll take me, won't you?",
  "16032": "Was it I who wanted to take the road to the right on top of the hill, insisting that I recognized the road?",
  "16033": "If so, if she had been wrong to accede to that offer when made, would she not be doubly wrong to hold him to it now that she saw his error?",
  "16034": "Say?",
  "16035": "Do you understand this?",
  "16036": "Wouldn't it be pretty?",
  "16037": "Then you will come and dine with me?",
  "16038": "Why did you not pull the church to pieces, and bring the chandelier home with you?",
  "16039": "How was it you so suddenly popped up in front of me as you did?",
  "16040": "Why do you insult me by telling me all this?",
  "16041": "What woman?",
  "16042": "And do you think, my excellent friend, that a musician when he adjusts the lyre would desire or claim to exceed or go beyond a musician in the tightening and loosening the strings?",

  "16053": "You sleep in this room, then?",
  "16054": "Where did you hide it?",
  "16055": "And have women, who have early imbibed notions of passive obedience, sufficient character to manage a family or educate children?",
  "16056": "Do you know her name?",
  "16057": "But wouldn't the shot be heard at the inn or somewhere?",
  "16058": "But suppose we HAD gone through the ceremony?",
  "16059": "Are you, indeed, going there?",
  "16060": "Well, is she there?",
  "16061": "Do you know will he be long, sir?",
  "16062": "Which side ought he to take?",
  "16063": "You were guarding me?",
  "16064": "Can he praestare fidem datam?",
  "16065": "Of monuments?",

  "16067": "Is it man or beast?",
  "16068": "Do you fly?",
  "16069": "What do you want among us now?",
  "16070": "Shall I respect man when he condemns me?",
  "16071": "What is he doing?",
  "16072": "Had all this, however, been even completely present to his companion, what other term could she have applied to the strongest and simplest of her ideas but the one that exactly fitted it?",
  "16073": "What shall I put you down for?",
  "16074": "Or what?",
  "16075": "What is your badge?",
  "16076": "And when the body is hungry, against eating?",
  "16077": "Is anything in me changed at all?",
  "16078": "What call?",
  "16079": "Perhaps it will be just the same to him if you don't?",
  "16080": "Upon what, sire?",
  "16081": "And now what are you going to do about it?",
  "16082": "But when do you expect to go?",
  "16083": "Are you in pain?",
  "16084": "Why don't you answer?",
  "16085": "Can you not tell when a warning is for your own good?",
  "16086": "And who can have done it but I?",
  "16087": "Well, sir, is not a substitute clothed with all the power and dignity of him who grants the commission?",
  "16088": "Are we not, sir?",
  "16089": "How should the individual choose his satisfactions?",
  "16090": "And who has filled your head with all this nonsense?",
  "16091": "You got your mother's letter?",
  "16092": "This looks well, eh?",
  "16093": "Well, and how are you my buck?",
  "16094": "Was not an early death his certain fate?",
  "16095": "And how did you manage to make them so grand, exalted, and brave with your wonderful verse?",
  "16096": "You wish to know what I will do?",
  "16097": "Tell me, at least, who you are?",
  "16098": "What shall be our excuse with the king?",
  "16099": "But is this really so?",
  "16100": "Have I called you down from the stars?",
  "16101": "For how much?",
  "16102": "But what do you want with me?",
  "16103": "Is not that quite enough?",
  "16104": "Say he need not lose his children and his wife, will he love you for that more than one who knows he well deserved the loss?",
  "16105": "Or had it transformed itself into this man, and what did the whole thing mean?",
  "16106": "Do you know anything of the commissionnaire?",
  "16107": "Through marriage?",
  "16108": "And do you impute it to either of those?",
  "16109": "Is she not perhaps still a married woman with a living husband?",
  "16110": "Is there never another to be found in the world?",
  "16111": "What's that, captain?",
  "16112": "Did you ever spend a quieter night in our little house at Königsberg?",
  "16113": "In nailing up the coffin?",
  "16114": "Have you enough till I come back?",
  "16115": "Are they better than gold pieces?",
  "16116": "Wel, what of him?",
  "16117": "Why all these complaints?",
  "16118": "If he does not boast of his deeds, who will?",
  "16119": "I am only asking you, is it worth it?",
  "16120": "Tom, have you anything to tell me?",
  "16121": "A gift?",
  "16122": "Blood is thicker than water, isn't it?",
  "16123": "But, my dear, will you not give us a little hope of touching this heart, so kind and generous?",
  "16124": "An't you?",
  "16125": "Then why do you keep thinking about it?",
  "16126": "What's the use of talking?",
  "16127": "Has he?",
  "16128": "Aren't you ashamed of yourself?",
  "16129": "What say you then?",
  "16130": "Do you reflect that all those words will be branded in my memory, and eating deeper eternally after you have left me?",
  "16131": "What example?",
  "16132": "Do you know him personally?",
  "16133": "You cannot mean to shoot me?",
  "16134": "Why does he never write?",
  "16135": "What do girls do who haven't any mothers to help them through their troubles?",
  "16136": "If I go out of and beyond the conception A, in order to recognize another B as connected with it, what foundation have I to rest on, whereby to render the synthesis possible?",
  "16137": "I don't know what you mean?",
  "16138": "Are they not a race contemptuous of others?",
  "16139": "Does it, in fine, consist in the greater obstacles opposed to the concert and accomplishment of the secret wishes of an unjust and interested majority?",

  "18329": "Aren't we all flung into the world only to hate each other, and so to torture ourselves and each other?",
  "18330": "Peacock?",
  "18331": "Was all that sound and many noises yours?",
  "18332": "Who are the sinners figuring in his drunken petitions?",
  "18333": "Why don't you go to see them off?",
  "18334": "Why had they not seen him as usual make his fine horse curvet in such beautiful style, to the delight and astonishment of the curious from the king's balcony?",
  "18335": "Isn't it sad?",
  "18336": "Who calls so loud?",
  "18337": "Why don't they cut their own children's ears into points to make them look sharp?",
  "18338": "I can buy pen, ink, and paper?",
  "18339": "Was it too much for you?",
  "18340": "Where could she have learnt this corruption almost incorporeal in the strength of its profanity and dissimulation?",
  "18341": "And what does it all mean?",
  "18342": "What is it for?",
  "18343": "Can not you see to their release?",
  "18344": "How can perfection spring from such materials?",
  "18345": "Where else could I have been?",
  "18346": "And the rich caparison, is that mine, too?",
  "18347": "And are you no longer so?",
  "18348": "What was the issue?",
  "18349": "Shall I see you home?",
  "18350": "Isn't it clever of me to remember that?",
  "18351": "Boofer lady, does 'oo love dadda?",
  "18352": "But how is your fame to be established?",
  "18353": "But what is such a satisfaction in comparison with the happiness of a life?",
  "18354": "Can I tell him I don't love him?",
  "18355": "Of whom and against whom do you demand that security, sir knight?",
  "18356": "Couldn't you give me a few more particulars?",
  "18357": "What on earth induced you to do it?",
  "18358": "Or has it become an indistinct apostolic tradition?",
  "18359": "Do you want to say how much?",
  "18360": "Was this cycle not exhausted and brought to a conclusion for him?",
  "18361": "Think any of the boys 'll run?",
  "18362": "Where do you come from now?",
  "18363": "Can't he spare time to see me?",
  "18364": "Is that an answer for a wife?",
  "18365": "Don't you think you would attract attention?",
  "18366": "And will the love of a lie be any part of a philosopher's nature?",
  "18367": "How did you trace it, then?",
  "18368": "You are mine, my love, aren't you?",
  "18369": "Were you ever painted yet?",
  "18370": "Have you no friends who could assist you?",
  "18371": "And then how would you slip it into my pocket?",
  "18372": "Do you know who this is?",
  "18373": "Do you not remember?",
  "18374": "You know that pair of women's gloves?",
  "18375": "Why did you wish for secrecy?",
  "18376": "Your troubles date from the time of your decision to return?",
  "18377": "Well, what do you think?",
  "18378": "Where was he born?",
  "18379": "What did you say?",
  "18380": "You bring me news, do you say?",
  "18381": "Shall I, in cool blood, set loose upon the earth a daemon whose delight is in death and wretchedness?",
  "18382": "Then what do you call the people with whom they're now having tea?",
  "18383": "And why do we need refreshment, my friends?",
  "18384": "And after all, what do we know of ourselves?",
  "18385": "Was it not probable that these symptoms would increase indefinitely, or at least until terminated by death itself?",
  "18386": "Had he not always been sufficient to himself, and now, at fifty, was it likely that he should trust another?",
  "18387": "Shall I see you again soon?",
  "18388": "Who can draw a strict line of demarcation between mind and body?",
  "18389": "Were there two?",
  "18390": "Are people so unhappy when they love?",
  "18391": "What is your object in speaking to me of this?",
  "18392": "On which side?",
  "18393": "Is he not, comte?",
  "18394": "Feel less thirsty after wetting your throat?",
  "18395": "He is, then, I suppose, the prince's jailer?",
  "18396": "Bends he his steps in our direction, child?",
  "18397": "We should be more cosy, shouldn't we?",
  "18398": "And this is your establishment?",
  "18399": "What are you saying, monsieur?",
  "18400": "Who will make the law?",
  "18401": "Why, are you a doctor, prince, or what?",
  "18402": "Not for long, surely?",
  "18403": "How could she get that?",
  "18404": "Are you acquainted with her?",
  "18405": "Haven't you heard of him?",
  "18406": "Hasn't it kept me and mine for years?",
  "18407": "About what, mama?",
  "18408": "Then what has become of the mummy?",
  "18409": "Mama, how can you sit and hear such statements?",
  "18410": "How can you ask?",
  "18411": "What had she done to excite the malice of an enemy?",
  "18412": "It isn't going to take you out of your way?",
  "18413": "You do not love me, then?",
  "18414": "Where have you come from, my dear count?",
  "18415": "Why are ye sitting here?",
  "18416": "Why then, as I perused them, did the hairs of my head erect themselves on end, and the blood of my body become congealed within my veins?",
  "18417": "And will you not so much honour me and so help me as to read it for me?",
  "18418": "And I shall not see her before you start?",
  "18419": "Or is his gravity only in appearance?",
  "18420": "How can that be done?",
  "18421": "How can we keep company with you?",
  "18422": "Oliver, what's the news?",
  "18423": "Are you?",
  "18424": "If we come soon can you go a piece wid us?",
  "18425": "What rank did he hold on board?",
  "18426": "Do I show it?",
  "18427": "Tilda HAS won something she didn't expect, I think, haven't you, dear?",
  "18428": "What will but felt the fleshly screen?",
  "18429": "If a superior man abandon virtue, how can he fulfil the requirements of that name?",
  "18430": "Hopes hovering in the near future as well as sorrows born of the past?",
  "18431": "Qu'est ce qu'un chancelier?",
  "18432": "You won't speak to me about it, my dear?",
  "18433": "But what ails you, father?",
  "18434": "Where are you going, wife?",
  "18435": "On business?",
  "18436": "Do you smell this little marsh?",
  "18437": "And reasoning is peculiarly his instrument?",
  "18438": "How the devil is one to get the intention of the soul except by painting exactly what one sees?",
  "18439": "None of my knaves there?",
  "18440": "Have you been waiting long?",
  "18441": "It's true they are innocent, isn't it?",
  "18442": "Or evil expectations?",
  "18443": "By the way, papa, where do you make the explosives?",
  "18444": "But who is this that breaks upon me?",
  "18445": "Why do you shout so?",
  "18446": "What must I promise?",
  "18447": "And you have accepted him?",
  "18448": "And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?",
  "18449": "Do you mean the bo'sun?",
  "18450": "To its address, my lord?",
  "18451": "What made you think it was she?",
  "18452": "What shall I say, madam?",
  "18453": "I believe I've only had the honour of seeing you once myself?",
  "18454": "I told him, and he was attentive until I had finished, and then burst out laughing again, and asked me if I was sore afterwards?",
  "18455": "Has the proud young lady gone?",
  "18456": "And did you also discover a bitter taste?",
  "18457": "You don't believe in having any standard of behaviour at all, do you?",
  "18458": "Should he find that place in this city if he could get there?",
  "18459": "Must I give up my place to your eminence, or shall I continue?",
  "18460": "Shall I be fatal to your happiness?",
  "18461": "Then why not come to it?",
  "18462": "Who in the dance so fleet?",
  "18463": "What are you reading now?",
  "18464": "You saw the captain?",
  "18465": "What say you to that?",
  "18466": "If the question is put, why do men desire to deposit their life outside their bodies?",
  "18467": "Well, but shall we not meet again?",
  "18468": "When you said that, did you mean that it seemed to you to be louder than the second one?",
  "18469": "We are almost drowned here amongst these lettuce, shall we speak?",
  "18470": "But it is long ago?",
  "18471": "How can I explain that infatuation?",
  "18472": "Well, what did he say about me?",
  "18473": "If it is my name I must have it, mustn't I?",
  "18474": "Are they boys?",
  "18475": "Do you affirm that?",
  "18476": "And who is to pursue him?",
  "18477": "May we not then conjecture that these rules are in fact the very safeguards which we should expect to find adopted for the protection of the king's life?",
  "18478": "Are you really sad?",
  "18479": "And where are your sisters?",
  "18480": "Well, what have you got to say to me?",
  "18481": "Has there been any inconsistency on his side to create alarm?",
  "18482": "Didn't the people laugh?",
  "18483": "How does it differ from soul?",
  "18484": "And what effect did this discourse produce?",
  "18485": "Rather a good marriage this, I believe?",
  "18486": "Which way is not despair?",
  "18487": "And what brings you up here under somebody else's name?",
  "18488": "May it not be that the utopists find it easier to expatiate upon these grand words than to seriously study social manifestations?",
  "18489": "Are you looking for anything?",
  "18490": "Did she perform any ceremony befitting it, or what did she do?",
  "18491": "Let me see, what harvest shall we have?",
  "18492": "To us forever are the gates of heaven shut, for who shall open them to us again?",
  "18493": "And now what is to be done?",
  "18494": "You say that she must have come back this way?",
  "18495": "There, NOW do you understand?",
  "18496": "What is the matter with you, you fool?",
  "18497": "Could he trust himself to come down to breakfast a free man in the morning?",
  "18498": "Could she make that sacrifice?",
  "18499": "Now, what in the world ailed the creature?",
  "18500": "Will they never bring that emetic?",
  "18501": "What have we to do?",
  "18502": "He did not marry this accomplished young lady?",
  "18503": "Who says man and wife are bad company?",
  "18504": "Who is to dance?",
  "18505": "That's all you know of him?",
  "18506": "But what business had rushes there, or I among them?",
  "18507": "If they don't stop, why should I?",
  "18508": "Why shouldn't they put 'em up and sell 'em by auction to men who are in need of such articles?",
  "18509": "And in what part of it?",
  "18510": "What have you been doing since I last saw you?",
  "18511": "Did she suffer from heart complaint?",
  "18512": "Could you come?",
  "18513": "Don't that seem strange?",
  "18514": "Where are these papers, then?",
  "18515": "Yes, but where's your special world?",
  "18516": "Shall you not need an instrument similar to the one which you used yesterday?",
  "18517": "And you've no security?",
  "18518": "And you were his comfort through everything?",
  "18519": "But will he then live for ever?",
  "18520": "Where bend unseen thy trackless course?",
  "18521": "When is it likely to come to an end?",
  "18522": "In which, sir?",
  "18523": "At school?",
  "18524": "Greshamsbury?",
  "18525": "Shall I repent of it?",
  "18526": "And do well, I am sure?",
  "18527": "Who brought me here?",
  "18528": "To what extent?",
  "18529": "That's the problem, isn't it?",
  "18530": "But whom send I to judge them?",
  "18531": "Now I am sure that you would not be too proud to earn the price of a new dress, would you?",
  "18532": "Where is the key?",
  "18533": "Shall we go together?",
  "18534": "What cable?",
  "18535": "Does he make any conditions?",
  "18536": "Does he say the quotations from his own speech are forgeries?",
  "18537": "Was it a sarpent?",
  "18538": "In different states shall the magistrates be different or the same?",
  "18539": "May not my love, my life, my duty, try to repay the confidence you have shown me?",
  "18540": "You want a pretext, do you not?",
  "18541": "What would the enemy say?",
  "18542": "To whom do you desire to leave this fortune?",
  "18543": "Have you anything to say at all?",
  "18544": "But tell me, is it a civilized country?",
  "18545": "Can't ye never keep things sep'rate?",
  "18546": "Did you never hear that?",
  "18547": "You mean when money is not wanted, but allowed to lie?",
  "18548": "Perhaps you cannot talk now?",
  "18549": "What do you intend?",
  "18550": "Or do you decline and dissent from this?",
  "18551": "And we have lost an opportunity to get back to our country?",
  "18552": "Why shouldn't he?",
  "18553": "What, mother?",
  "18554": "And what's this?",
  "18555": "How could you mistake me so?",
  "18556": "What is the matter, gentlemen?",
  "18557": "Are we softened a little?",
  "18558": "How are you getting on with your woman?",
  "18559": "Socrates, what do you mean?",
  "18560": "Six children, sir?",
  "18561": "D'you mean to say you can look at the painting of that flesh and say it's not good?",
  "18562": "Are you not ashamed of yourself?",
  "18563": "Isn't it beastly?",
  "18564": "Does she know where he has gone to?",
  "18565": "Why wouldn't you go?",
  "18566": "No friends?",
  "18567": "I suppose he has money, hasn't he?",
  "18568": "Are they yoked?",
  "18569": "Besides, why should I die?",
  "18570": "How should the bells be rung?",
  "18571": "What sort of a lady is she?",
  "18572": "But am I to remain always alone in this vast and dismal chamber?",
  "18573": "Do you know she is a very virtuous woman?",
  "18574": "Canst drink the waters of the crisped spring?",
  "18575": "What's that you've got?",
  "18576": "What is the difference?",
  "18577": "Will you look at them?",
  "18578": "How shall the mother summon courage to bid him adieu?",
  "18579": "What sort of night was it?",
  "18580": "Your younger sisters must be very young?",
  "18581": "So soon as that?",
  "18582": "My dear, how am I to say?",
  "18583": "Why, what would you do with them?",
  "18584": "Would she have him fire off real guns, and have his hair cut, and his whiskers shaved, and his eyes turned right and left, and his trousers pipeclayed?",
  "18585": "And after all, what did it matter to me, and why did it matter to me?",
  "18586": "But, if you love me you would like me to be your husband?",
  "18587": "And their names?",
  "18588": "Why did you not ask for me at my room if you were in the hotel?",
  "18589": "Ilyin?",
  "18590": "Then where's thy husband?",
  "18591": "Should not their custom be to spare them, considering the danger which there is that the whole race may one day fall under the yoke of the barbarians?",
  "18592": "Had he been dreaming?",
  "18593": "MacCallum who, sir?",
  "18594": "Why deprive myself of the actual charm of my enjoyments to inform others what I enjoyed?",
  "18595": "My hay for the district?",
  "18596": "What is your proposal?",
  "18597": "What about your master?",
  "18598": "And then you heard nothing until you read the reports of the death in the paper?",
  "18599": "How, go then?",
  "18600": "Is he ALWAYS hungry?",
  "18601": "Are you sure it was me?",
  "18602": "Why not history?",
  "18603": "Why do you ask such an unnecessary question?",
  "18604": "Who were his parents?",
  "18605": "Come to see the old man, hay?",
  "18606": "We have the resources, but are we fully ready to use them?",
  "18607": "What shall I do to him, sahib?",
  "18608": "Do you wish to come in?",
  "18609": "Pray, how came you to know that men were formerly fools?",
  "18610": "Oh, is this true what you say?",
  "18611": "You call THAT something to lend?",
  "18612": "Shall we condescend to legislate on any of these particulars?",
  "18613": "Meanwhile, what are you going to do?",
  "18614": "But where was his mind?",
  "18615": "And the matter seems serious to you?",
  "18616": "What's sov'rin, and what's c'u'nity?",
  "18617": "What is it that once or twice they have quarreled with the governor, and because they would not yield have been proclaimed?",
  "18618": "How do you find yourself today?",
  "18619": "When would they return, and how?",
  "18620": "What business had he to talk to her about being taken away from uncles and aunts?",
  "18621": "What is there in the tents?",
  "18622": "Where were you going now?",
  "18623": "His blankets?",
  "18624": "Why not let me take a farm?",
  "18625": "Dare you answer me thus?",
  "18626": "Why, but do you speak this seriously?",
  "18627": "You have nothing else to tell us?",
  "18628": "Could it have lived an hour as happily?",
  "18629": "Would it degrade me as much as to break my faith with the helpless?",
  "18630": "Whom will you send for?",
  "18631": "Now, could she do it?",
  "18632": "All safe inside?",
  "18633": "Well, boys, how does it feel to be in space once more?",
  "18634": "What do you mean by making such a racket?",
  "18635": "But if I accept the appointment, and yet disagree with the bishop, what then?",
  "18636": "Where should she live?",
  "18637": "Have I not tended that dear couch for years?",
  "18638": "Are we not as much so as you?",
  "18639": "Will you meet me there?",
  "18640": "What have I to do, to free myself for ever of your visits, but to abandon you to your deserts?",
  "18641": "Fusion, fusion, this horrible fusion of two beings, which every woman and most men insisted on, was it not nauseous and horrible anyhow, whether it was a fusion of the spirit or of the emotional body?",
  "18642": "What could be the meaning of it?",
  "18643": "Good news, then?",
  "18644": "What is it called, dear guardian?",
  "18645": "Two leagues beyond the summit of the hill?",
  "18646": "Whose for choice?",

  "18650": "How are you feeling this morning?",
  "18651": "Canoeing?",
  "18652": "How would it be from now on?",
  "18653": "How could he, poor boy?",
  "18654": "Well, on the road itself?",
  "18655": "And how should he know them?",
  "18656": "You will do all you can do, your excellency?",
  "18657": "Where was I?",
  "18658": "Is that your opinion, D'Herblay?",
  "18659": "Into what room did you take him?",
  "18660": "He hesitated to give it to you?",
  "18661": "Or is it only your good luck?",
  "18662": "D'ye say so?",
  "18663": "Where and when?",
  "18664": "But you don't believe that he will make fire?",
  "18665": "What do you expect me to do?",
  "18666": "Don't you think he's charming?",
  "18667": "What's de matter?",
  "18668": "Much here else?",

  "20678": "Man, do you think I would have you perjure yourself, even if that would do me a service?",
  "20679": "Don't you know, demmit?",
  "20680": "Is that the name of this house, miss?",
  "20681": "No bickerings?",
  "20682": "Of these men?",
  "20683": "Have you got a bit of paper and a pencil?",
  "20684": "What further, pray?",
  "20685": "And who told you, madame, that I have any hostile intentions against your son?",
  "20686": "What will it be, then, when I put a duke's robe on my back, or dress myself in gold and pearls like a count?",
  "20687": "And who ever dreamed that it was anything but a mistake, that had made me give it the laudanum?",
  "20688": "It means some horrible volcano smoking somewhere, doesn't it?",
  "20689": "How can we be reconciled?",
  "20690": "What is this shovel load?",
  "20691": "What is in the woods?",
  "20692": "Then, does it bear evident marks of his workmanship?",
  "20693": "And who found this father for you?",
  "20694": "You have heard that laugh before, I should think, or something like it?",
  "20695": "What account does he give of himself?",
  "20696": "Then in making their laws they may sometimes make them rightly, and sometimes not?",

  "20717": "What, is he going to keep them?",
  "20718": "Tomorrow evening?",
  "20719": "You promise me?",
  "20720": "Was I to believe him in earnest in his intention to penetrate to the centre of this massive globe?",
  "20721": "Was not that a declaration from you?",
  "20722": "Is it possible that that kind old woman is really the cannibal goblin?",
  "20723": "A portrait, I suppose?",
  "20724": "But how is this feasible?",
  "20725": "What was his mouth?",
  "20726": "Fetch him?",
  "20727": "Of how much?",
  "20728": "Do you see that?",
  "20729": "Does not the donkey bear the load you're bearing?",

  "20736": "Suppose he began to shout?",
  "20737": "Why do you still keep me with you?",
  "20738": "How did you come there, that day?",
  "20739": "May one not say much the same of a community?",
  "20740": "You are silent?",
  "20741": "Does anyone else know of this?",
  "20742": "Some lady looked out for him?",

  "20765": "And what are you?",
  "20766": "Or something?",
  "20767": "And he is to be deemed courageous whose spirit retains in pleasure and in pain the commands of reason about what he ought or ought not to fear?",
  "20768": "Is not that the true theory of race?",
  "20769": "What can he have been planning?",
  "20770": "Can a drunkard swear on his honour?",
  "20771": "Is that a weapon in your hand?",
  "20772": "Why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to disappoint?",
  "20773": "So you've turned up all right?",
  "20774": "Who would wish me, not only to be sentenced, but to endure the sentence to the end?",
  "20775": "How can we most quickly reach the tents of the sheik?",
  "20776": "And is there anything more akin to wisdom than truth?",

  "20781": "No, will you not wake?",
  "20782": "I, and yet?",
  "20783": "What enlightenment did he need?",
  "20784": "Well, do you see yonder a kind of little island surrounded by a circle of water?",
  "20785": "Don't you see we're all standing still?",
  "20786": "You haven't ever seen me before by any chance, if you know what I mean, have you?",
  "20787": "What on earth is this?",
  "20788": "That is, when I have lighted the match?",
  "20789": "But it may be put as a question, not improper to be investigated, that if a constitution does not exist, how came the idea of its existence so generally established?",
  "20790": "Persecute you?",
  "20791": "And you awoke, and found you were lying on your back, or with your head hanging over the bedside, or suffering some pain from indigestion?",
  "20792": "How do you make that out?",
  "20793": "Did you ever see her furious?",
  "20794": "But an incident that will oblige you perhaps to become an inhabitant of this land from which you flee?",
  "20795": "And so you're glad to leave me?",
  "20796": "And where does he keep the figures that aren't straight sailing?",
  "20797": "Can't we make a game of poker between us?",
  "20798": "You will assist me in the work, will you not?",
  "20799": "And is it over now?",
  "20800": "Shall we tell her now?",
  "20801": "And leave your case unfinished?",

  "20810": "Then how did it manage?",
  "20811": "Tom, why didn't you wake me sooner?",
  "20812": "Why should I dread your doing your worst to all about you?",
  "20813": "On honor?",
  "20814": "As to altering my way of living by enlarging my expenses, I put it to him whether in our present unsettled and difficult circumstances, it would not be simply ridiculous, if it were no worse?",
  "20815": "And you, monsieur?",
  "20816": "What is the meaning of this, sir?",
  "20817": "It seems that my wife is not very well?",

  "20822": "What delusion can this be?",
  "20823": "Have you ever worked in a retail store before?",
  "20824": "That's an odd expression, ain't it?",
  "20825": "How shall I do?",
  "20826": "If she dislikes that so much, why did she ever marry herself?",
  "20827": "Do we not owe to the full and free use of that reason everything great which mankind has created?",
  "20828": "Not bitten, are you?",
  "20829": "Had he seen the vessel which was changing its course and seemed to be nearing us?",
  "20830": "And does its plane coincide with the plane of the earth?",
  "20831": "Won't it be just the same in the country?",
  "20832": "Why too much?",
  "20833": "Run away from home?",
  "20834": "Or so eager for revenge as to be indifferent to money?",

  "24571": "How could I give her up, perhaps to stand her trial for murder?",
  "24572": "But what did my independence avail me, when I had bound myself in new fetters?",
  "24573": "What were these affrighted, shrieking voices calling?",
  "24574": "Did you ever see a man there who is accustomed to walk about with a ruler in his hand?",
  "24575": "Whence this heat?",
  "24576": "If you want t' see him, why don't you go there?",
  "24577": "Once more, then, what stops you?",
  "24578": "Was I a fool?",
  "24579": "How does he for the bells?",
  "24580": "How long ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity, and hate knowledge?",
  "24581": "Why is it that when you awake to the world of realities you nearly always feel, sometimes very vividly, that the vanished dream has carried with it some enigma which you have failed to solve?",
  "24582": "What is stronger?",
  "24583": "After all, what is there for us to fear in this house?",
  "24584": "But did it ever speak thus?",
  "24585": "Aren't you going to dress up?",
  "24586": "How much is that?",
  "24587": "You will see him, if he comes up?",
  "24588": "But what was this portion of the globe which had been swallowed by cataclysms?",
  "24589": "What shall I do to him?",
  "24590": "What should I be, O my friend, but thy friend?",
  "24591": "Will you be as frank?",
  "24592": "Who among the people here could possibly think it worth his while to have his head done into marble?",
  "24593": "What shall we say to her?",
  "24594": "Why, what can you earn?",
  "24595": "Where will you meet?",
  "24596": "Today, almost for the first time, I set to work seriously, and what happened?",
  "24597": "You are there, are you, my friend?",
  "24598": "Who could hope ever to do anything to the satisfaction of the press?",
  "24599": "What's the matter naow?",
  "24600": "Now, about the honest hands?",
  "24601": "Would you like to be a gull?",
  "24602": "Why did they want out?",
  "24603": "An' see that big one with a patch in her foresail an' a new jib?",
  "24604": "What are the uses of decisions of courts?",
  "24605": "Haven't you chariot and horses and hounds?",
  "24606": "Oh, that was it?",
  "24607": "How can I be bribed?",
  "24608": "To him or to me?",
  "24609": "Why did you not dissuade him from it?",
  "24610": "Have you anything more to say?",
  "24611": "Any trade?",
  "24612": "What should I do with beans?",
  "24613": "I shall see you again, then, my lord?",
  "24614": "What then shall be done?",
  "24615": "What regulates them?",
  "24616": "Quite sure you can stand it?",
  "24617": "You would not give her pain?",
  "24618": "Tell us, shall we tell her now?",
  "24619": "What am I to call you?",
  "24620": "What do you mean by a struggle?",
  "24621": "How do you do?",
  "24622": "Where'd you get him ?",
  "24623": "Do you wish to take it, and what price will you pay if I let you have the whole of it?",
  "24624": "Is this man in town?",
  "24625": "Any mail?",
  "24626": "D'you ever try it?",
  "24627": "You're playing secretaire?",
  "24628": "And was it really possible and true, that her last darling was to be torn from her?",
  "24629": "What did he care that his aunts were only two ignorant old women?",
  "24630": "Can your name be RUMPELSTILTSKIN?",
  "24631": "Are you not going in, sir?",
  "24632": "Ah, what is that?",
  "24633": "Can you not trust me as a physician when I tell you so?",
  "24634": "Then what, exactly, is your plan for us?",
  "24635": "How did you do that?",
  "24636": "If so, what news?",
  "24637": "Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as his father did before him?",
  "24638": "Why don't you do something useful?",
  "24639": "But when and where had I seen them?",
  "24640": "Did any see it after?",
  "24641": "Lithia?",
  "24642": "Why should not the same sort of thing happen to me?",
  "24643": "Do you think so, really?",
  "24644": "And you would say the same sort of thing of the physician?",
  "24645": "But was it cast after all?",
  "24646": "Both lost?",
  "24647": "Is he so haughty?",
  "24648": "How then can I know, my dear?",
  "24649": "Will not?",
  "24650": "Will it not slap and pinch the envious dowager, that dares to reflect upon its own delicious?",
  "24651": "Can you still lie?",
  "24652": "You wished me to know the reasons?",
  "24653": "Or else, why did she not go out of the neighborhood, and get a situation where she was not known?",
  "24654": "Do you know that he holds terrestrial beings under his control?",
  "24655": "Has she been with you long?",
  "24656": "Or shall we say that they are in harmony with the apparent social will only, and really stand condemned?",
  "24657": "An explanation?",
  "24658": "What shall I be next?",
  "24659": "Where's the larder?",
  "24660": "Suppose a boy sauced you back when you told him to do something?",
  "24661": "Putting ourselves out of the question, what would you think of a girl who could engage herself to any man under such circumstances?",
  "24662": "As at present?",
  "24663": "What is your name?",
  "24664": "Whom have I hurt?",
  "24665": "Do you mean if you give in?",
  "24666": "Or have tasted the bag of the bee?",
  "24667": "For rich caparisons or trapping gay?",
  "24668": "Would you have it?",
  "24669": "What hotel did you manage?",
  "24670": "Where falls the balance of freedoms here?",
  "24671": "What sauce are they most dainty for?",
  "24672": "What will have gained by telling me all this?",
  "24673": "Is there not love in my heart, and constancy in my resolves?",
  "24674": "Is this aught like to thy friend?",
  "24675": "Were not the odds the other way?",
  "24676": "Did he keep any record of his cases?",
  "24677": "How often have I asked you not to take my things?",
  "24678": "How can one wrong creatures that don't exist?",
  "24679": "Rank?",
  "24680": "Well, then, how's he going to take the sea baths if it ain't on the sea?",
  "24681": "How did it begin, when did it all come about?",
  "24682": "Where do you go?",
  "24683": "Well, what is to be done?",
  "24684": "Can you hear a mewing cat?",
  "24685": "Well, isn't it all for her good?",
  "24686": "Have you any opinion to offer, count?",
  "24687": "How long must we stay, do you think?",
  "24688": "What, gossip?",
  "24689": "What is the matter with it?",
  "24690": "But may I be allowed to place the mark for the second shooting?",
  "24691": "Have you ever noticed that all little children are blond?",
  "24692": "And that cavalier, that guest, that nobleman who arrived before she came?",
  "24693": "When am I to wear it?",
  "24694": "What made you go blind that sudden?",
  "24695": "How do you communicate?",
  "24696": "Have you enemies, then?",
  "24697": "Which of them will you test?",
  "24698": "Would you really do that?",
  "24699": "How is your old fellow?",
  "24700": "What bottles?",
  "24701": "Could we not keep it as a secret?",
  "24702": "But proportional to what?",
  "24703": "How did you come here?",
  "24704": "What would these insects eat, if we did not pass this way?",
  "24705": "Your advice, then?",
  "24706": "From the monastery?",
  "24707": "Are you not meditating?",
  "24708": "Why otherwise, with such an opportunity, hadn't he demanded it?",
  "24709": "Would you compel such a state of affairs?",
  "24710": "Then how do you know?",
  "24711": "Where must I sleep, then?",
  "24712": "Supposing nobody should ever fetch me, how long would they consent to keep me there?",
  "24713": "You will marry me, won't you?",
  "24714": "And I?",
  "24715": "Are you alone, madam?",
  "24716": "Vulgar?",
  "24717": "Is not this change wrought in your minds a very important change?",
  "24718": "True?",
  "24719": "Shall I run on and stop them?",
  "24720": "What sort of road would that be?",
  "24721": "Is it your intention to go to an hotel, sir?",
  "24722": "Agree with what?",
  "24723": "Shall we go this high very long?",
  "24724": "Up?",
  "24725": "Was it this room?",
  "24726": "How then was thy tail created?",
  "24727": "Anyone shot a fox?",
  "24728": "Then what business is it of yours?",
  "24729": "Dishonorable?",
  "24730": "What is the steamer's name?",
  "24731": "Do you often go to see it?",
  "24732": "Damn me, won't you dance?",
  "24733": "How is it that the convicts are lying yonder dead, in the middle of the enclosure?",
  "24734": "But where should she go?",
  "24735": "You would be afraid to draw such an inference, would you not?",
  "24736": "Why, instead of a revolution, did they not content themselves with a reform?",
  "24737": "Why should you say that?",
  "24738": "And had it ready a nice little pinch of salt to put upon his tail?",
  "24739": "In what direction?",
  "24740": "And why was this?",
  "24741": "Now, did it strike your ladyship that she was like anybody?",
  "24742": "An' s'posin' he does?",
  "24743": "What do you mean to do with him?",
  "24744": "Not caring for their lives, is it?",
  "24745": "Will you promise to sit up with me to bear me company?",
  "24746": "What are you waiting for?",
  "24747": "What bell was that?",
  "24748": "And with you, governor?",
  "24749": "Perhaps you don't know it?",
  "24750": "How came the words forth from her?",
  "24751": "Have I not always fought for your glory and interests?",
  "24752": "What, after all, was this blood of which she had taught herself to think so much?",
  "24753": "How do you do?",
  "24754": "But could it be otherwise?",
  "24755": "Must I compel men to render her fitting honor?",
  "24756": "For who gets wealth, that puts not from the shore?",
  "24757": "You feel, in other words, that she lies to you?",
  "24758": "Who has?",
  "24759": "And what crime has he committed?",
  "24760": "And whom are you waiting for?",
  "24761": "Why not say so?",
  "24762": "Nine, ten, eleven?",
  "24763": "And it was a fierce one?",
  "24764": "Why couldn't he go to his own home?",
  "24765": "What is it they 'ad of you, sir?",
  "24766": "What have you been doing all this time, eh?",
  "24767": "Well, what does that lead up to?",
  "24768": "To whom did he call?",
  "24769": "And what are you?",
  "24770": "Could he be dead?",
  "24771": "Will you be willing to leave your present situation and try?",
  "24772": "What else can we do?",
  "24773": "Had he fallen during the attack on his rider, or was he straying in the bush, or had the convicts carried him off?",
  "24774": "How can he tell?",
  "24775": "Is it with me or for me that you are angry?",
  "24776": "Then how is it that I seem to understand them myself?",
  "24777": "What am I to DO with this?",
  "24778": "Where dwell we now?",
  "24779": "Why are they always anxious?",
  "24780": "What man has authority over himself?",
  "24781": "Who attends to them?",
  "24782": "And now, monseigneur, your answer to this proposition?",
  "24783": "And that caused his sister to refuse my brother?",
  "24784": "Didn't your grandmother ever write you?",
  "24785": "And you think she would be angry?",
  "24786": "What news have you?",
  "24787": "And have you not seen any of our other friends?",
  "24788": "All I'd done?",
  "24789": "If there are other causes of poverty than competition, does that prevent it from contributing its share?",
  "24790": "Why should I deceive you?",
  "24791": "What is it you fear?",
  "24792": "Faithful to whom?",
  "24793": "Ah, but if you got nothing to eat for ever so long?",
  "24794": "A horror?",
  "24795": "Do you think I was sorry?",
  "24796": "What's the matter?",
  "24797": "What about the chair?",
  "24798": "I suppose you will live with her now?",
  "24799": "Of what consequence is it to me, then, whether he be grateful or not?",
  "24800": "And why should the goblins mind you, pray?",
  "24801": "What villainy is this?",
  "24802": "Blewett?",
  "24803": "At home?",
  "24804": "Why, instead of transports that should have intoxicated me with their deliciousness, did I experience only fears and repugnance?",
  "24805": "Whats he?",
  "24806": "Well, he took that icon home with him for a few days and what did he do?",
  "24807": "Why, we must ask, do you trouble yourself so much about death?",
  "24808": "How does your lady, and how thrives your love?",
  "24809": "The greatest affection of which he is capable?",
  "24810": "Wife?",
  "24811": "A pox, is this your inns o' court breeding, not to know your friends and your relations, your elders, and your betters?",
  "24812": "For whence should it be derived?",
  "24813": "Why don't you speak to her?",
  "24814": "And what's her name?",
  "24815": "What are those we know?",
  "24816": "Now do you want me to tell you who you are?",
  "24817": "Are you dissatisfied with my service, say?",
  "24818": "What is the object of slaying the spirit of vegetation at any time and above all in spring, when his services are most wanted?",
  "24819": "What is there in your son's face?",
  "24820": "Gone where?",
  "24821": "What length of course do you propose, dear heart?",
  "24822": "Isn't the house shut up, too?",
  "24823": "Isn't she here?",
  "24824": "In what manner was I protected by him?",
  "24825": "What do you like best?",
  "24826": "Harder on the back, this, than frum the dory, ain't it?",
  "24827": "Is it customary, I ask you, to help to tenderloin with one's fingers?",
  "24828": "Do you imagine that a person can die like this?",
  "24829": "Have you received the orders, and will you act upon them?",
  "24830": "How are they called who follow others in spite of them?",
  "24831": "Do you mean that you saw the murder?",
  "24832": "So I ask you if ye were her friends?",
  "24833": "Was it not then a man like you and me, who first proposed this law, and by speaking persuaded the ancients?",
  "24834": "A political one, I suppose?",
  "24835": "But is there anything impossible for my d'Artagnan, the noble and loyal gentleman?",
  "24836": "What, I ask, in that case, would have been your conduct towards her?",
  "24837": "Do I turn to the right, or to the left hand?",
  "24838": "And suppose he falls?",
  "24839": "An expedition, sir?",
  "24840": "Is it not enough to set him thinking about it?",
  "24841": "What am I?",
  "24842": "An' did ye not marry a nagur?",
  "24843": "Do you believe they're his own?",
  "24844": "And if I obtain this son, the object of my most cherished wishes, this son who is so necessary to me, who will take my place with him when I shall be absent?",
  "24845": "But you're not making a mistake?",
  "24846": "Was you a party in anything, ma'am?",
  "24847": "The knight they went to?",
  "24848": "Ask him what?",
  "24849": "Won't that make it all right?",
  "24850": "Have I done something for the general interest?",
  "24851": "Have they legs and chops?",
  "24852": "What do you mean by this conduct?",
  "24853": "You're not a skater, I suppose?",
  "24854": "With him, aunt?",
  "24855": "Why does he not come to me?",
  "24856": "Among all the unfathomable precipices which surrounded him, which was his choice?",
  "24857": "Isn't it an extraordinary thing?",
  "24858": "Mais, monsieur, is it not time to begin to take more counsel of humanity, and less of your courage?",
  "24859": "Don't you see that flock of big birds making for us?",
  "24860": "How shall I requite you?",
  "24861": "Or when he chew'd it?",
  "24862": "How do I know, my dear, what young men do?",
  "24863": "How can I regret when what I did was inevitable?",
  "24864": "And, after all, why shouldn't we believe that?",
  "24865": "Can you have the heart to do it?",
  "24866": "Was not death infinitely more lovely and noble than such a life?",
  "24867": "When shall I set out?",
  "24868": "But what is this on the chest?",
  "24869": "Where's mother?",
  "24870": "Shall we turn?",
  "24871": "And now, do you wish to attend to your letters?",
  "24872": "May it be that, in some fashion or other, you want me?",
  "24873": "Do you know that the least garrison is of twenty companies of infantry?",
  "24874": "Have these confessed?",
  "24875": "Do you suppose I've asked him for an assurance?",
  "24876": "Are you sure it was my house she was coming to?",
  "24877": "And what are those hatfuls of pence and halfpence?",
  "24878": "What does the change mean?",
  "24879": "Monsieur le comte had an enemy there, then?",
  "24880": "Didn't I explain to you?",
  "24881": "Oh, can't you understand?",
  "24882": "Where are you off to?",
  "24883": "Why should this be so?",
  "24884": "His son?",
  "24885": "Well, and what next?",
  "24886": "What, you're on his track?",
  "24887": "Do you expect them today?",
  "24888": "A parson?",
  "24889": "Now, in what sign will the sun then be?",
  "24890": "Is that the way you love your neighbor as yourself?",
  "24891": "If they hear of this, will they let it pass?",
  "24892": "But where are you going,' that you talk about bidding goodbye?",
  "24893": "So you hate each other?",
  "24894": "Do you go home to dinner?",
  "24895": "Tell me how and why am I again a prisoner?",
  "24896": "You intend to look after me, then?",
  "24897": "Is not my husband here?",
  "24898": "And is she gone?",
  "24899": "If he had been your own boy, you would have put him to it, just the same, I suppose?",
  "24900": "We asked who they were?",
  "24901": "Is there not one among them who has seen it all, and who knows it to be true?",
  "24902": "Or cold?",
  "24903": "Are you cold?",
  "24904": "What were the joy of man, what else could give him pleasure, but pretty maids and noble dames?",
  "24905": "Can you not be more definite?",
  "24906": "Who is she, or how did you get her?",
  "24907": "Tell me why you came?",
  "24908": "Or, shall we continue on our way?",
  "24909": "Do you hear the dog?",
  "24910": "Is his dog dead?",
  "24911": "With our business, how can we get away?",
  "24912": "And what is this?",
  "24913": "What will then become of me?",
  "24914": "You understand, don't you, that if she didn't do this there would be no knowing what she might do?",
  "24915": "Even in the midst of joy, may he not be permitted to be gloomy and oppressed?",
  "24916": "And what does his eminence think of this love, which is, by the bye, no secret to anybody?",
  "24917": "How do they act?",
  "24918": "Which do you like best?",
  "24919": "Have you seen the army?",
  "24920": "But what have I here said, that reflections very refined and metaphysical have little or no influence upon us?",
  "24921": "Fwhat?",
  "24922": "They grow out of our knowledge, ma'am?",
  "24923": "But could you think, because the nodding husband would not wake, that e'er the watchful lover slept?",
  "24924": "And the papers?",
  "24925": "Can you not come to me now, at once, before anything terrible happens?",
  "24926": "My card?",
  "24927": "Why, isn't it there?",
  "24928": "Well, this is strange news, isn't it?",
  "24929": "Tell me, I beseech you, what ails you?",
  "24930": "Of what race could these people be?",
  "24931": "Nevyedovsky?",
  "24932": "Where does your highness wish to go?",
  "24933": "And hasn't it now?",
  "24934": "Will not you, as well as your brother, intercede with your uncle in our behalf?",
  "24935": "Is SHE coming?",
  "24936": "Did you see her face?",
  "24937": "To love me, perhaps?",
  "24938": "In the first place, what proof have we of the fact?",
  "24939": "What are you trying to do?",
  "24940": "I strive to engage my uncle in my projects for the repair of the ruins, for the culture of those wide bogs and moorlands why is it that he turns away and looks down embarrassed?",
  "24941": "No right to be warden of the hospital, papa?",
  "24942": "When are we to discover them?",
  "24943": "Diamonds on the moon?",
  "24944": "What is your errand, then, with me, sir?",
  "24945": "Why is it that the dogs have failed to bark?",
  "24946": "And yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him?",
  "24947": "And do you think your power as great with the fraternity as monsieur le cure told me it was just now?",
  "24948": "And whose room is this, my dear child?",
  "24949": "And me?",
  "24950": "If that is the case, why wait till evening?",
  "24951": "What children?",
  "24952": "Won't you let me run you round in the car?",
  "24953": "Lemme go with you?",
  "24954": "Is there any other point which I can make clear?",
  "24955": "ITS DECISION WHAT is a battle?",
  "24956": "Do you mean to say it's not of importance?",
  "24957": "Must I speak again?",
  "24958": "You are not laughing?",
  "24959": "Is there any news today?",
  "24960": "Or a fairy in disguise?",
  "24961": "Bingley?",
  "24962": "Let's see it?",
  "24963": "How, got the start?",
  "24964": "Wot dye mean?",

  "25733": "What are your products?",
  "25734": "How's that for the bare outline?",
  "25735": "How could he know, even?",
  "25736": "Don't you read?",
  "25737": "My good fellow?",
  "25738": "How could I be so cruel to you?",
  "25739": "It is my marriage you mean, is it not, dear grandpapa?",
  "25740": "But tell me, and tell me true, in what way did you die?",
  "25741": "How can one think with one's head all fuzzy?",
  "25742": "How can you expect that I shall continue to love you, when I see you maintain, when I hear you swear to me a thing which I know to be false?",

  "25744": "Have you forgotten your soul, your spirit, your man's energy, the treasure of your heart?",
  "25745": "WHY so pale and wan, fond lover?",
  "25746": "Two in the morning, or two in the afternoon?",
  "25747": "Are you sick then?",
  "25748": "Who knows what may happen to us anywhere?",
  "25749": "Have I not heard you say that he would have had you too a soldier, but for your mother?",
  "25750": "What does a man say to a girl?",
  "25751": "Did she own she liked it?",
  "25752": "What is your own idea, then?",
  "25753": "But how can he explain that smile, that excitement after he had been talking to her?",
  "25754": "Should I, too, look back?",
  "25755": "Have you nothing to confess, somebody will ask me, upon this subject?",
  "25756": "Is this enviable or is it not?",
  "25757": "What was the object of the second man?",
  "25758": "Do you think I can stay to become nothing to you?",
  "25759": "Shall I have a barricado made against my friends, to be barr'd of any pleasure they can bring in to me with their honourable visitation?",
  "25760": "What I want to know is, where I ought to rank myself?",
  "25761": "Will you take a gold piece?",
  "25762": "Was it but the mockery of penitence?",
  "25763": "Are they?",
  "25764": "Saccharum, doctor?",
  "25765": "Of course you love him dearly?",
  "25766": "What was the thickness of this wall?",
  "25767": "What pen can describe it?",
  "25768": "Is controlling it as other property the same thing as destroying it, or driving it away?",
  "25769": "What is that, my love?",
  "25770": "Was there no one with you?",
  "25771": "Can you tell us what to do?",
  "25772": "To whom?",
  "25773": "When a good man sticks his bayonet through another good man, father of a family, or, perhaps, a great artist, what idea is he following out?",

  "25785": "What's the matter with me, anyhow?",
  "25786": "Are you set on the death of that spy?",
  "25787": "Does his mother not know this?",
  "25788": "Then you noticed it too?",
  "25789": "I am right, am I not?",
  "25790": "Why did she take it into her head to die at that moment?",

  "25795": "Shall I bear false witness?",
  "25796": "Is he not reviving slowly?",
  "25797": "What's afoot now, young un?",
  "25798": "What sort of a place was it, and what would he be like?",

  "25800": "Who's the other cup for?",
  "25801": "Is there more?",
  "25802": "What paper was that?",
  "25803": "And when you know, will you tell me?",
  "25804": "How long would it take for a telegram to reach him?",
  "25805": "Isn't it a dog, sir?",
  "25806": "Do you wish to make good your boasted prowess?",
  "25807": "Is it not, therefore, clear, that in marrying him, you would descend to a rank below you own?",
  "25808": "How should I forget ?",
  "25809": "What boot these wonders?",
  "25810": "And who says so?",

  "25813": "If this sailor had escaped the perils of the shipwreck, why should not the captain?",
  "25814": "Oh, how can I live?",
  "25815": "But how did that old man, alone, in opposition to the general opinion, so truly discern the importance of the people's view of the events that in all his activity he was never once untrue to it?",
  "25816": "I suppose you can transform us into beasts as well as birds?",
  "25817": "How is it one never sees you?",
  "25818": "Where've you been?",
  "25819": "Now say if I conceal anything from you?",

  "25821": "Won't your father miss you, and look for you, and let down another rainbow for you?",
  "25822": "Is not all that happiness when they are the three together, husband, wife and child?",
  "25823": "How is it you are so late?",
  "25824": "You have kept a diary of all these so strange things, is it not so?",
  "25825": "But your companions?",
  "25826": "I trust that there is nothing of consequence which I have overlooked?",
  "25827": "Is it for my own sake?",
  "25828": "Well, what are you going to do?",
  "25829": "Don't you see her there away from you?",
  "25830": "And is there nothing on the way?",
  "25831": "Gentlemen, please you change a few crowns for a very excellent blade here?",
  "25832": "What, now, is the significance of this appeal from ANALYSIS to the false judgments of the synthesis?",
  "25833": "Is not that it?",
  "25834": "Forgive you?",
  "25835": "What association?",
  "25836": "But where are these persons, then?",
  "25837": "What doth he seek on the height?",
  "25838": "Where shall we lie in wait?",
  "25839": "And by what gate did they go out?",
  "25840": "From whom can come so many disgraces heaped upon her head, if not from him?",
  "25841": "Who invited you?",
  "25842": "Making love in play, eh?",
  "25843": "How, then, could his father's heart remain void, and closed to its influence?",
  "25844": "Have you heard the story?",
  "25845": "Would you really give us the money?",
  "25846": "But what other internal attributes of such an object can I think than those which my internal sense presents to me?",
  "25847": "Any children?",
  "25848": "How is it distant?",
  "25849": "Which box do you mean?",
  "25850": "How can a system of education flourish that begins by so monstrous a falsehood, which the sense of hearing suffices to contradict?",

  "25860": "Do you hear me when I tell you that, my darling?",
  "25861": "And when you can do better, you will?",
  "25862": "And does he catch plenty of fish?",
  "25863": "Did you ever stop to think of all the love letters that have been found after death?",
  "25864": "But the rebellion continues, and, now that the election is over, may not all have a common interest to reunite in a common effort to save our common country?",
  "25865": "Why do you say that?",
  "25866": "What could she have to conceal from me whose happiness she knew principally consisted in that of herself and her daughter?",
  "25867": "You wouldn't care to go on board for the next trip, and have tea there?",
  "25868": "But if death is the journey to another place, and there, as men say, all the dead abide, what good, O my friends and judges, can be greater than this?",
  "25869": "Do you expect news from him?",
  "25870": "Will you trust me?",
  "25871": "On what authority, then, do you venture to attack universal consent, and give the lie to the human race?",
  "25872": "Say, is it thus those honours you requite?",
  "25873": "Where is he who called me?",
  "25874": "May I not come near you?",
  "25875": "What are you doing for it?",
  "25876": "Father, you have trained me from my cradle?",
  "25877": "What do you say, then, to my right?",
  "25878": "Am I so like you?",

  "25884": "So does my grocer stigmatize me when I complain of the quality of his sultanas, and he answers in one breath that they are the best sultanas, and how can I expect the best sultanas at that price?",
  "25885": "What of him?",
  "25886": "Do you do nothing but architectural sculpture?",
  "25887": "Har you a goin' to pay me?",
  "25888": "What nonsense?",
  "25889": "Have you not said that that abduction was entirely political?",

  "25913": "Don't you neglect him?",
  "25914": "Aren't you too, ferryman, a searcher for the right path?",
  "25915": "Why do you ask me such a question?",
  "25916": "Who was speaking?",
  "25917": "And, if you will let me for a moment speak of the very highest forms of literature, do we not regard them as highest simply because the more we know the truer they seem, and the more competent we are to appreciate beauty the more beautiful they are?",
  "25918": "What defect?",
  "25919": "You're sure about the money?",
  "25920": "But why did you think about it, bishop?",

  "27329": "In economic language what are luxuries?",
  "27330": "The true question to be decided then is, whether the smallness of the number, as a temporary regulation, be dangerous to the public liberty?",
  "27331": "What did it profit a man to gain the whole world if he lost his soul?",
  "27332": "Mean and shabby, eh?",
  "27333": "Is it not so?",
  "27334": "How many arts do you understand?",
  "27335": "Well, isn't the most civilized thing going, the man who has learnt to wear his income properly?",

  "27351": "Does she exercise any authority over you in that way?",
  "27352": "Ought it?",
  "27353": "Why am I so old?",
  "27354": "Would she forgive him?",
  "27355": "Or with what peculiar force does he suppose himself invigorated, that difficulties hitherto invincible should give way before him?",
  "27356": "What do you think has happened this morning?",
  "27357": "No, why be sorry?",
  "27358": "Why this hideous costume, when he had so much money in his purse?",
  "27359": "Is any sick?",

  "27638": "Have you not asked papa for money?",
  "27639": "Is there anything whimsical about me?",
  "27640": "Wouldn't it be nice if it could last?",
  "27641": "Is this ingratitude, however?",
  "27642": "For nothing?",
  "27643": "The winch, you say?",
  "27644": "Was ever a man in such a fearful fool's position?",
  "27645": "But this kind man who has done so much will, I am sure, take you right on to my house?",
  "27646": "But if no one among us is capable of governing himself, then who among us has the capacity to govern someone else?",
  "27647": "Was personal happiness the aim and object of their ambition?",
  "27648": "Have you ever seen a wire jacket?",
  "27649": "Cranmer awaits us in the private chapel?",
  "27650": "And how about today's telegram?",
  "27651": "Where had that daring singer got to?",
  "27652": "Was it he who threw us that bottle, when the vessel made her first cruise?",
  "27653": "You didn't mean to ask that?",
  "27654": "Brilliant?",
  "27655": "Getting a little beyond our depth, dear, aren't we?",
  "27656": "Now, what is competition?",
  "27657": "Why didn't you come near us all these three days, eh?",
  "27658": "Do you know that you are speaking to me quite as a friend?",
  "27659": "What do you do then?",
  "27660": "Do you think we live as cheaply as we might?",
  "27661": "You haven't opened the parcel and swallowed one or two as you come along, have you?",
  "27662": "Surely there are classified lists?",
  "27663": "Why ride into the middle of the battalion?",
  "27664": "May I ask if you can confirm these statements?",
  "27665": "Is not this an infallible and sovereign antidote?",
  "27666": "Well, what's this now?",
  "27667": "Isn't it fortunate I've got such an imagination?",
  "27668": "Now, what have we a right to possess?",
  "27669": "A cigarette?",
  "27670": "But what did he do, my dear?",
  "27671": "What act?",
  "27672": "What in thunder is it?",
  "27673": "And the man?",
  "27674": "How am I to understand you, mon pere?",
  "27675": "Why dilate upon what everybody knows?",
  "27676": "Might this be for you, sir?",
  "27677": "How can you learn lessons in here?",
  "27678": "Who be these?",
  "27679": "Do you love my son?",
  "27680": "Who gets up in the gray dawn to call on another man's wife?",
  "27681": "What follows that angel?",
  "27682": "Will it strengthen our families and support our children?",
  "27683": "Why where should I leave them but where I found them?",
  "27684": "Shall he now be arrested in his desolating career?",
  "27685": "Do you know what that means?",
  "27686": "But why should I make a long story of it?",
  "27687": "Mightn't I stay and sleep with you tonight, grandmother?",
  "27688": "Are you not jealous at all?",
  "27689": "And is not the chief object of vanity, our bravery or learning, our wit or breeding, our eloquence or address, our taste or abilities?",
  "27690": "Jo, I hope you haven't done anything rash?",
  "27691": "And do you believe it to be so?",
  "27692": "Do you take milk in yours?",
  "27693": "What fiend is this?",
  "27694": "Where are they?",
  "27695": "Would any one believe it?",
  "27696": "What if I've accepted too passively the funny form of our life?",
  "27697": "What, indeed, can tend to deprave the character more than outward submission and inward contempt?",
  "27698": "If they bite and kick?",
  "27699": "Is there that about me that should affright a man?",
  "27700": "For how can any experience be adequate with an idea?",
  "27701": "What is this I hear about you?",
  "27702": "How old are you, dear?",
  "27703": "I wonder if they made that fearful sound I heard just before you came?",
  "27704": "What made them kick you out?",
  "27705": "Am I allowed to repeat it?",
  "27706": "I think that this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with me for six o'clock?",
  "27707": "Have you any dice in your pocket?",
  "27708": "What on earth put such a notion into your head?",
  "27709": "None belonging to your father?",
  "27710": "What had he to say?",
  "27711": "Owing to him?",
  "27712": "To me, sir?",
  "27713": "What do you suppose she wants to talk about tomorrow?",
  "27714": "Would he say a lie?",
  "27715": "How much money had these men fraudulently obtained?",
  "27716": "How many have you loved?",
  "27717": "Then why, when you were able to run away, did you go back to him?",
  "27718": "And don't you think the governor ought to let me have it?",
  "27719": "You are alone?",
  "27720": "What are your favourite flowers?",
  "27721": "Why didn't I go in then?",
  "27722": "By your misfortune?",
  "27723": "Now are you satisfied?",
  "27724": "Who is your lady friend with the big grey envelope and the fat monogram outside?",
  "27725": "How many millions upon millions of centuries would pass before that bird had carried away even a square foot of that mountain, how many eons upon eons of ages before it had carried away all?",
  "27726": "Have you got them?",
  "27727": "Did you get lost?",
  "27728": "I wonder how he felt when he heard it?",
  "27729": "What need for weapon?",
  "27730": "'Ow many times have I got to tell you to be careful of them plates?",
  "27731": "Weevle?",
  "27732": "What you're after, why you left the block house, why you given me that there chart, I don't know, now, do I?",
  "27733": "Are we falling?",
  "27734": "And by character?",
  "27735": "And would not a really good education furnish the best safeguard?",
  "27736": "What manner of man are you?",
  "27737": "I think you are growing less cool, my friend, and are beginning to be a trifle surprised, aren't you?",
  "27738": "And that one?",
  "27739": "Has he ever taken from the rich that he did not give again to the poor?",
  "27740": "Has your mother relented at last?",
  "27741": "What do you want to do?",
  "27742": "Is this all your spinning, grandmother?",
  "27743": "What sort of ship?",
  "27744": "And do they not share?",
  "27745": "Why isn't it enough?",
  "27746": "Shall I meet strange, heavenly things?",
  "27747": "Didn't I see him seize your hand?",
  "27748": "What is that thing?",
  "27749": "But who else?",
  "27750": "Why, how?",
  "27751": "Do you hear, my children?",
  "27752": "Can you deny that all that was craft and deceit and fraud and greed?",
  "27753": "How shall we set about it?",
  "27754": "Not too difficult?",
  "27755": "Were his father's religious devotion, his teachers warnings, his own knowledge, his own search able to keep him safe?",
  "27756": "Should they be embarked?",
  "27757": "Is my experience but of yesterday?",
  "27758": "Can I trust in you?",
  "27759": "Are you in earnest?",
  "27760": "Where are you to go?",
  "27761": "Do you want to earn half a crown?",
  "27762": "Wilcox?",
  "27763": "What do I mean?",
  "27764": "But will no one remain in the house, my lord?",
  "27765": "How, then, with these variations and with revenues so uncertain, can we establish even distribution and uniform wages for laborers?",
  "27766": "Of the hearses?",
  "27767": "But will you not drink with me, sir?",
  "27768": "What avail is it?",
  "27769": "Don't you see them?",
  "27770": "Oh, I must, hey?",
  "27771": "What more natural than to imagine that the violets and the hyacinths, the roses and the anemones, sprang from their dust, were empurpled or incarnadined by their blood, and contained some portion of their spirit?",
  "27772": "Or are they both in this their own reward?",
  "27773": "Said ye not truly, aforetime, that we should live and meet?",
  "27774": "What do we do?",
  "27775": "How will you live?",
  "27776": "Why don't you fall yourself?",
  "27777": "Will you remember that, if you please?",
  "27778": "Does he read ee very long zermons, my dear?",
  "27779": "What is a passport?",
  "27780": "How long do you remain in town?",
  "27781": "Don't you, old man?",
  "27782": "Where shall I see the head of him which contrived to murder his father, which I will tear to pieces with my own hands?",
  "27783": "Why this absence of mind, and sweet irresolution?",
  "27784": "We better than you?",
  "27785": "Did this mad wife of his carry it off with her?",
  "27786": "Had the man seen through him?",
  "27787": "But will you promise to have me took there, sir, and laid along with him?",
  "27788": "But if I do not marry?",
  "27789": "Why did he interfere with me, and fill your mind with such falsehood?",
  "27790": "But when one has no experience, how can one tell what is sickness and what is health?",
  "27791": "How can you tell who is poor?",
  "27792": "Is it so precious?",
  "27793": "Why am I to be disturbed?",
  "27794": "Will you take my advice?",
  "27795": "Something important?",
  "27796": "Perhaps you think I am mad, eh?",
  "27797": "Shall you have the courage?",
  "27798": "Will you forget him?",
  "27799": "Wait for you?",
  "27800": "Now, what fault can you point out in him?",
  "27801": "CUI BONO?",
  "27802": "Where had the dragon gone in such a short space of time?",
  "27803": "You've got a friend here?",
  "27804": "What has he made you?",
  "27805": "You keep the registers of entries and departures?",
  "27806": "To what tribe do they belong?",
  "27807": "I don't suppose that you have noticed it?",
  "27808": "Couldn't you ask him here dinner or something?",
  "27809": "And then?",
  "27810": "What does your wife want?",
  "27811": "Couldn't you wish to be married to him yourself, if that was the case?",
  "27812": "It was his life or mine, but far more than that, it was his life or hers, for how could I leave her in the power of this madman?",
  "27813": "Then there is a truth I don't know?",
  "27814": "How did I get hold of that?",
  "27815": "Whatever is the matter?",
  "27816": "And it is true that you did not set it on fire?",
  "27817": "Has anything unpleasant happened since I saw you?",
  "27818": "Is it believed that axioms in metaphysics, declarations of right, harangues from the tribune, will put a stop to the disbanding of an army?",
  "27819": "What does not a man undergo for the sake of a cure?",
  "27820": "Shan't you?",
  "27821": "You a member here?",
  "27822": "What is your own experience of him?",
  "27823": "But aren't you mistaken in thinking that you wouldn't force him, wouldn't punish him?",
  "27824": "Me, young ladies?",
  "27825": "What are these corruptions?",
  "27826": "Doesn't he?",
  "27827": "Why must he look farther than their platform when he claims himself to stand by his platform?",
  "27828": "Now, surely, if he takes so warmly to people who are not related to him at all, may he not take as warmly to his own kin?",
  "27829": "Not since the humour of gentility was upon you, did you?",
  "27830": "Governor come round?",
  "27831": "That boy's tutor?",
  "27832": "What is a soul?",
  "27833": "And with our wives?",
  "27834": "Who would think of plotting with a poor little weak creature like me?",
  "27835": "What is his exact kin to us, mother?",
  "27836": "Is this a new brand of humour?",
  "27837": "Yes, what were we talking about?",
  "27838": "Do I know them?",
  "27839": "And what business have you here?",
  "27840": "You know who bricks and mortar is, I suppose, sir?",
  "27841": "Oh, what's the use of me saying anything?",
  "27842": "I make the first advances?",
  "27843": "Why strive for the knowledge of things if we become more cowardly thereby?",
  "27844": "Why, how do you come to be here?",
  "27845": "What the devil is he doing here?",
  "27846": "What's he to do with the lassie?",
  "27847": "Why must people kneel down to pray?",
  "27848": "Do you like him?",
  "27849": "First tell the boys, what we have decided?",
  "27850": "What is it to be?",
  "27851": "Tell us, dear, what do the creatures look like?",
  "27852": "Do you see that whale now?",
  "27853": "How is it that there are birds enough ready to replace immediately a lost mate of either sex?",
  "27854": "You admit, I hope, that I have a right to speak about what concerns the dignity of my wife's sister?",
  "27855": "Will somebody hand me anything hard and bruising to pelt at her?",
  "27856": "Is he industrious at his work and respectful to you?",
  "27857": "That's the way the song runs, isn't it?",
  "27858": "Could her face inspire passion at all now?",
  "27859": "Why ought I to know?",
  "27860": "And you are not furious?",
  "27861": "Will you let me go away?",
  "27862": "John, why don't you say something?",
  "27863": "But what shall I tell the dairyman's wife?",
  "27864": "And you don't know what they do it for?",
  "27865": "Or at some public school, perhaps?",
  "27866": "They do, do they?",
  "27867": "Is not the night mournful, sad, and melancholic?",
  "27868": "I asked them, if they were at liberty to tell me the truth of what they were to do with me?",
  "27869": "Why are you sorry, sir?",
  "27870": "What prison is he in?",
  "27871": "Shall we go on, your excellency, fine champagne?",
  "27872": "Leave our brother to come to us?",
  "27873": "Will you really not have tea?",
  "27874": "Whom do you expect to find here?",
  "27875": "Have you no other to propose?",
  "27876": "What can a writer, who professes scepticism, have in common with radical views?",
  "27877": "See that blue dory behind him?",
  "27878": "But is an education which ignores them all a liberal education?",
  "27879": "What upon?",
  "27880": "But who has told you?",
  "27881": "Where are my priwileges?",
  "27882": "Well, did she say what she was coming for?",
  "27883": "How can I ever thank you?",
  "27884": "You own the name and renounce the alias?",
  "27885": "Is he of noble family, and rich?",
  "27886": "How then are we to begin our strike to destroy him?",
  "27887": "Who is this boy?",
  "27888": "And who hit you at all?",
  "27889": "What are these men's leading principles, and about what kind of things are they busy, and for what kind of reasons do they love and honor?",
  "27890": "Thornfield?",
  "27891": "May I ask if you are very busy just now?",
  "27892": "How can it concern him to learn how the self came to be what it is, or what it will be in the distant future?",
  "27893": "You think it will?",
  "27894": "But why should I weary you with details?",
  "27895": "So you kept him after all?",
  "27896": "And the queen?",
  "27897": "That we see before our noses?",
  "27898": "Can I never tell my story in a plain, straightforward way?",
  "27899": "Can competition in labor be abolished?",
  "27900": "You cannot help us?",
  "27901": "But what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance?",
  "27902": "What was the use of his being somewhere in the neighbourhood if she had no means of knowing where she could find him?",
  "27903": "You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?",
  "27904": "You will protect me from him?",
  "27905": "Had you heard?",
  "27906": "Can you remember that?",
  "27907": "Ever live by cheating at play?",
  "27908": "Why do you permit such a surgeon to have the care of the sick, wounded, and dying soldiers?",
  "27909": "And is that why he hits her?",
  "27910": "Why, what is there to understand?",
  "27911": "Yet you have a large establishment, too, I am told?",
  "27912": "And you think that I am going to send you back to that world which must know me no more?",
  "27913": "What is done to infanticides in this country?",
  "27914": "And did you see anyone?",
  "27915": "Well, then, what makes you talk so wild?",
  "27916": "You have formed one, then?",
  "27917": "Will you please pardon my rudeness?",
  "27918": "My dear father, may I beg you to prepare your mind for what I am going to say?",
  "27919": "With what my father said just now?",
  "27920": "What did you think of that, sir?",
  "27921": "Would you like me to sit down for a minute or two?",
  "27922": "He is going with you, is he not?",
  "27923": "Of what disposition is he?",
  "27924": "What is it, then?",
  "27925": "Where did you really get them?",
  "27926": "Mark must be here, yet why doesn't he answer me?",
  "27927": "What did you expect to gain by that?",
  "27928": "What heart can hold?",
  "27929": "Had he left her there to her fate in the lonely jungle?",
  "27930": "How do you do, all of you?",
  "27931": "Do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not talk as fast, and admire what she admires as rapturously as herself?",
  "27932": "Curious?",
  "27933": "Do you intend to sit up for me?",
  "27934": "But would the man acknowledge the relation?",
  "27935": "What are you doing now?",
  "27936": "Do you suppose that if I had made such a revelation to the king, I should have been alive now?",
  "27937": "He had a passion for pictures, and why should he not be able to paint as well as anybody else?",
  "27938": "Are you the gentleman who caused the accident?",
  "27939": "And the pay?",
  "27940": "Husband?",
  "27941": "I know what everyone would say is the right thing to do, but what do you say?",
  "27942": "What difference can it make to you?",
  "27943": "How could he know what comes from a woman's wavering sympathies, what from her inborn coquetry, and what from love itself?",
  "27944": "Was he a proprietor, or only a usufructuary?",
  "27945": "Wasn't that nonsensical?",
  "27946": "You have sold all your clothes?",
  "27947": "Surely you learnt that too?",
  "27948": "WHAT is it?",
  "27949": "But at this moment who knows if we may not be frightfully crushed between the two glassy surfaces?",
  "27950": "We must take care that that affair comes off all right, must we not?",
  "27951": "Why do you shake me like that?",
  "27952": "Now really should a cock be brought into a tragic play?",
  "27953": "Is his thread spun?",
  "27954": "Have not you an intimate friend?",
  "27955": "But how, and wherewith?",
  "27956": "That was a very different account of matters, was it not?",
  "27957": "What laws mean you?",
  "27958": "And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps?",
  "27959": "And on what will you sleep?",
  "27960": "That is what comes of your gospel of love, is it?",
  "27961": "Beautiful?",
  "27962": "Didn't say nothin' 'bout my old man, s'pose?",
  "27963": "Is it really possible that perfectly innocent people are kept here?",
  "27964": "You know the road?",
  "27965": "So if I say they're gone, you'll bear me witness, will you?",
  "27966": "Why should you not mention the sum?",
  "27967": "They're quite neat and decent, aren't they?",
  "27968": "To what a devil, then, said he, serve so many paltry heaps and bundles of papers and copies which you give me?",
  "27969": "How did you get such small small legs?",
  "27970": "But why shouldn't they petition, doctor?",
  "27971": "What is that news?",
  "27972": "His nieces accompany him, no doubt?",
  "27973": "Well, but whom are you attacking?",
  "27974": "Am I fool?",
  "27975": "What should hinder it?",
  "27976": "Is this true, my pulse?",
  "27977": "Have you given in your resignation, mademoiselle?",
  "27978": "How can you make yourself so inferior to me, as to show such a bad spirit?",
  "27979": "How can that be managed?",
  "27980": "When shall we be able to fish again?",
  "27981": "And what may your purpose be, most lofty lady?",
  "27982": "And when the better part of their products are consumed by others at the play, do you assure me that their families are not in want?",
  "27983": "Do I combine?",
  "27984": "What good was there in doing that?",
  "27985": "How can you do it seriously?",
  "27986": "Read?",
  "27987": "Was I absurd?",
  "27988": "Live like this?",
  "27989": "And if I could, what comfort to me?",
  "27990": "Aglaya, may I kiss YOUR prince?",
  "27991": "You mean to ask, I said, what will be our answer?",
  "27992": "You do not mean to inherit that infamous crotchet my brother has got into his head?",
  "27993": "Not a circus?",
  "27994": "Well, what have you got in your ear?",
  "27995": "What came of it?",
  "27996": "What makes it smell so funny?",
  "27997": "Which way are you going?",
  "27998": "Sure, little woman?",
  "27999": "The boy's, then?",
  "28000": "How d'you account for the general indifference, then?",
  "28001": "Why do you delay?",
  "28002": "Proud, eh?",
  "28003": "Since no man has aught of what he leaves, what is't to leave betimes?",
  "28004": "How is he?",
  "28005": "Were there not the brilliant particles of a halo in the air about his head?",
  "28006": "I therefore turned towards him with a stern countenance, and asked, who he called fool?",
  "28007": "What should ye have in common with cats and wolves?",
  "28008": "You want me to swear?",
  "28009": "What you standing there for?",
  "28010": "Perhaps he is just as fond of suffering?",
  "28011": "What's the matter with you, old man?",
  "28012": "Married woman, I believe?",
  "28013": "Will you grant it to me?",
  "28014": "And the chin, with its dimples, as in health, might it not be hers?",
  "28015": "What will happen then?",
  "28016": "You mean that the thing is supernatural?",
  "28017": "And if I do speak to her, my lord, what then?",
  "28018": "Was it sufficient?",
  "28019": "Have you ever committed a sin?",
  "28020": "Presented to whom?",
  "28021": "Not for myself?",
  "28022": "Well, sir, will you go?",
  "28023": "Where did you go?",
  "28024": "What have we done?",
  "28025": "Do you jog hither, wagging your tails, to pant at my wine, and bepiss my barrel?",

  "28799": "But why have you no packing bag?",
  "28800": "He does your bidding?",
  "28801": "Had he not better take the big umbrella?",
  "28802": "But of what?",
  "28803": "Shall you be there, sir?",
  "28804": "You didn't know him, did you?",
  "28805": "Mamma, are you asleep?",
  "28806": "Have I not, sir?",
  "28807": "And so many children poor?",
  "28808": "At least, what?",
  "28809": "Are not the roofs and the lintels wet?",
  "28810": "At what time did he go?",
  "28811": "Perfectly plain, isn't it?",
  "28812": "Then how could they tear me pitilessly from all that was dear to me, and lock me up in prison like a wild animal?",
  "28813": "And who's to make him?",
  "28814": "How did the boat strike when she went in?",
  "28815": "How hight she?",
  "28816": "You understand what I mean?",
  "28817": "But is not war an art?",
  "28818": "Postponed?",
  "28819": "She is, is she?",
  "28820": "Who is fit for it?",
  "28821": "Do you not as a rule think women below your notice as companions?",
  "28822": "Will you tell me where the BRITANNIA was wrecked?",
  "28823": "What chance had they against one who, if she had a mind, could put by out of her income twice as much as they, poor women, could spend?",
  "28824": "What mede is aye to live in comfort?",
  "28825": "Who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads?",
  "28826": "Who's over me?",
  "28827": "Why, in the devil's name, have they served me thus?",
  "28828": "You know her husband, of course?",
  "28829": "Is it possible that the meaning of life was not disclosed to him before he died?",
  "28830": "Are you brutes?",
  "28831": "In fact, what is to be expected in any country where taste and cultivation of mind do not supply the place of youthful beauty and animal spirits?",
  "28832": "Think it'll ride?",
  "28833": "What'll the other people in the house say to my being here?",
  "28834": "But was it all there was of life?",
  "28835": "What private box?",
  "28836": "Nor written?",
  "28837": "Would I not give all that I have of strength at one blow if I could open his eyes to see as I see but for one minute?",
  "28838": "Consequently, a capital blade?",
  "28839": "And break it out?",
  "28840": "He has the horse, then?",
  "28841": "You're not sorry you've come, are you?",
  "28842": "The entrance cannot be easy?",
  "28843": "Why do I not give it?",
  "28844": "And does that hinder you from letting me know the second reason?",
  "28845": "Clarence?",
  "28846": "Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy?",
  "28847": "Why did you play us such a trick, damn you?",
  "28848": "What is his object?",
  "28849": "What would happen next?",
  "28850": "Who might do this but the women?",
  "28851": "Why don't you scream?",
  "28852": "Do you know that?",
  "28853": "Why, my dear friend, do I not see you?",
  "28854": "But, in truth, what is the good of these disguises?",
  "28855": "Will that restore it to sight?",
  "28856": "Where is this person?",
  "28857": "What can a man spend his ha'pence on here in this country hole?",
  "28858": "Catharine, did I do wrong?",
  "28859": "How much are you out of pocket?",
  "28860": "What has become of her?",
  "28861": "And if difficulties were necessary to increase the splendor of the effort, what could be harder for a restless, ambitious girl than to give up her own hopes, plans, and desires, and cheerfully live for others?",
  "28862": "Could we advertise, then, asking for information from wharfingers?",
  "28863": "Does this infinite awaken in us the idea of essence, while we can attribute to ourselves only the idea of existence?",
  "28864": "We will say ten o'clock then?",
  "28865": "To its honors, to its flowers, to its golden aspirations?",
  "28866": "But always smelling those leather books, what can be expected?",
  "28867": "Is it not time for a change?",
  "28868": "What did happen to me?",
  "28869": "Do you think now that I shall tell you what motive he had had in starting out?",
  "28870": "You perhaps think I should have expected this refusal?",
  "28871": "And your cargo?",
  "28872": "Can you not see that if when I had sight, and fame, and all heart could desire, I could not win her love, what she might feel for me now, in my helpless blindness, could be but pity?",
  "28873": "You do like me a bit, don't you?",
  "28874": "What's the game?",
  "28875": "Not related to her, sir?",
  "28876": "But, they say, is that true right, social right, fraternal right?",
  "28877": "Do you know, sir, that that man did all this?",
  "28878": "Did he give you anything else?",
  "28879": "Why should he die, for he felt that he could not live, under such a weight of obloquy?",
  "28880": "It's he then who has told you?",
  "28881": "Is that all?",
  "28882": "Took?",
  "28883": "How much do you know?",
  "28884": "Out of your own pocket?",
  "28885": "Why was it none would give it, then?",
  "28886": "Shall they be banished from the district, or from the whole land?",
  "28887": "Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?",
  "28888": "Did I abuse you?",
  "28889": "You who see your betters bearing up under this shame every day, meekly suffering under the slights of fortune, gentle and unpitied, poor, and rather despised for their poverty, do you ever step down from your prosperity and wash the feet of these poor wearied beggars?",
  "28890": "And who wants to be acquainted with you?",
  "28891": "What can you do?",
  "28892": "Are you in love with the cows?",
  "28893": "Not to her uncle?",
  "28894": "Why should it not, at a certain depth, attain an impassable limit, instead of rising to such a point as to fuse the most infusible metals?",
  "28895": "But why have you done it at all?",
  "28896": "Haven't you noticed it?",
  "28897": "And what does this groom do?",
  "28898": "Sun in your eyes and his face in the shadow?",
  "28899": "Would she hear of his being slapped and beat by drummers demnebly?",
  "28900": "Who did all that mischief?",
  "28901": "Ain't we gotta live?",
  "28902": "Are we at the pole?",
  "28903": "Do you hear, do you hear what he says?",
  "28904": "Don't you think you could find some work to do?",
  "28905": "Was he again to be disturbed?",
  "28906": "Was she going to act and keep house?",
  "28907": "But why does he have this idea of a horse?",
  "28908": "Was that his work or was it possibly the doing of someone who was bent upon counteracting his schemes?",
  "28909": "Two minutes wrong?",
  "28910": "Do you not guess, monsieur?",
  "28911": "Where's your horse?",
  "28912": "Will you give me something to eat and a bed?",
  "28913": "What would they do to assist them?",
  "28914": "Let us have the land?",
  "28915": "Does he ever pay the rent for you?",
  "28916": "Might I ask you, sir, to pacify my mind?",
  "28917": "It is difficult to rise above the jungle standards and reason by the light of civilized ways, is it not, my friend?",
  "28918": "What about your government and all this treatment?",
  "28919": "What the devil are you doing?",
  "28920": "What help is to be hoped for, what consolation, what solace?",
  "28921": "Or, may we not owe their visit to the dead colt?",
  "28922": "Where shall we search for him?",
  "28923": "Why should you keep such things from me?",
  "28924": "Physiology not an experimental science?",
  "28925": "What about the dough?",
  "28926": "Can she have loved my brother so little as to be able to forget him so soon?",
  "28927": "It wasn't then that she told you?",
  "28928": "What thing?",
  "28929": "Do you suppose she takes you for a symbol?",
  "28930": "No worse news of master, I hope, sir?",
  "28931": "Has she run away because we are come?",
  "28932": "Shall I tell her or not?",
  "28933": "But then, why had he permitted that man to leave him alive?",
  "28934": "What's that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for?",
  "28935": "On which of these actions did he reflect with the most pleasure, when he was summoned by the angel of death?",
  "28936": "How shall I don't?",
  "28937": "What was in there?",
  "28938": "But tell me, what is she?",
  "28939": "Wouldn't you like to be king of that splendid fairyland?",
  "28940": "Is he ungrateful to no one else?",
  "28941": "Aye, how do you know he is?",
  "28942": "Does our friend eke out his modest income with a crossing?",
  "28943": "The stag spoke?",
  "28944": "What are the dangers which menace us?",
  "28945": "Monsieur does not then renounce his excursion for this evening?",
  "28946": "You imagine, I dare say, that you invented something quite new?",
  "28947": "Why shouldn't she win?",
  "28948": "Is there anything in what I say, or am I talking to no purpose?",
  "28949": "Was he already with the queen?",
  "28950": "What is the matter, that with all his ill usage of me, I cannot hate him?",
  "28951": "Now, I beseech you, do tell me, have you ever attended to their pairing and breeding?",
  "28952": "Oh, what have I done to be blessed with such friends?",
  "28953": "Two one pound notes, or friends?",
  "28954": "Can it be that the dog has not understood his master?",
  "28955": "Why indeed should they maintain a watch?",
  "28956": "What was I to do?",
  "28957": "So will you abandon your plan?",
  "28958": "What can I say that will enable you to understand the depth of my sorrow?",
  "28959": "Did she still love him?",
  "28960": "What you 'bout?",
  "28961": "And of the pleasures of love, and all other pleasures, the same holds good?",
  "28962": "What does she want?",
  "28963": "You needn't go yet, need you?",
  "28964": "Will it be safe to leave you there alone?",
  "28965": "How many things she knows, doesn't she?",
  "28966": "In your room?",
  "28967": "Then you won't forgive me?",
  "28968": "Can dignity of mind exist with such trivial cares?",
  "28969": "Ah, friends, do ye divine also my heart's double will?",
  "28970": "Who was th' lad what carried th' flag?",
  "28971": "Are they dead, ma'am?",
  "28972": "And what shall we have in lieu of it?",
  "28973": "It is a lovely night, and why should we not prolong our ride a little?",
  "28974": "Will she then have sufficient native energy to look into herself for comfort, and cultivate her dormant faculties?",
  "28975": "You will not come?",
  "28976": "For arrears of pay?",
  "28977": "Copperfield, my dear fellow, how do you do?",
  "28978": "And is the city which is under a tyrant rich or poor?",
  "28979": "Was it not too clear that, let the matter go how it would, there was no happiness in store for her?",
  "28980": "Would you kindly send one of your constables for two buckets of water?",
  "28981": "But what is there, then, above the sun?",
  "28982": "How is it you don't know?",
  "28983": "Why are they not given up to the church, as they ought to be?",
  "28984": "But you, d'Artagnan, what is the matter with you, and what has happened to you personally?",
  "28985": "To conceal his name?",
  "28986": "Is it at some set season?",
  "28987": "Did she know anything of his life upon the sea?",
  "28988": "Where is so awful a responsibility laid upon them?",
  "28989": "Well, my boy, what's there to prevent you?",
  "28990": "What more natural, after this, than the dream which came to him?",
  "28991": "If vices be genuine and virtue a deception, as you think, why do you call the inventors of that deceiving art sages?",
  "28992": "Has the law any eyes to witness your grief?",
  "28993": "How can I be vain when I know I'm homely?",
  "28994": "The little girl?",
  "28995": "Kicked on that occasion for cheating at dice?",
  "28996": "What proofs do you require?",
  "28997": "On business, eh?",
  "28998": "Why, what's happened?",
  "28999": "Not hurt you, did I?",
  "29000": "Was it the time the sandy cat walked round the balustrade?",
  "29001": "What insults, girl?",
  "29002": "And how does any one know whether he will stay days, months, or years?",
  "29003": "Well, how are you going to get out of that?",
  "29004": "Have you your stethoscope?",
  "29005": "Well, where can we find it?",
  "29006": "Was it mere social effect, fulfilment of ambition in the social world, in the community of mankind?",
  "29007": "How about this ad of yours?",
  "29008": "Do you still suppose that I am a boy ignorant of my own mind, and mistaking the impulses of my own soul?",
  "29009": "Must we then not be married, in order to sanctify the union of our hearts?",
  "29010": "Ay, but will you promise to come?",
  "29011": "What did you write about?",
  "29012": "Perhaps you are laughing again?",
  "29013": "So you think that these people have already quitted the island?",
  "29014": "What's a lad with good friends doing as loblolly boy?",
  "29015": "Who can tell if that mind, when the touchstone is applied to it, will not be found of a mean and vulgar character?",
  "29016": "But what time's breakfast, sir?",
  "29017": "Did you signal us, lording?",
  "29018": "Where was you raised?",
  "29019": "May I read it?",
  "29020": "Where is the treasure?",
  "29021": "You know?",
  "29022": "Snatch at it?",
  "29023": "Would not this mode of proceeding be preferable to that of causing letters to be opened by any one who may be employed, and replying to them by a circular to which it is only necessary to attach a date?",
  "29024": "Well, what say you to a friend that would take this bitter bargain off your hands?",
  "29025": "Just step into this corner a moment, will you?",
  "29026": "What will you do, dear?",
  "29027": "Who shall prevent him?",
  "29028": "Is it a profession?",
  "29029": "You admit you owe him three pounds then for a month's board?",
  "29030": "Have I not found her friendless, and cold, and comfortless?",
  "29031": "Is he learned?",
  "29032": "Ay, where are they?",
  "29033": "Who is there?",
  "29034": "Why should he feel joy at turning back?",
  "29035": "Must I really?",
  "29036": "And shall I not do as the first man?",
  "29037": "Thy work, the KARMA?",
  "29038": "It's queer, isn't it?",
  "29039": "Was I not a fool, when I refused to look at or speak to him?",
  "29040": "And may we say that this has been proven?",
  "29041": "Does she cook the dinner?",
  "29042": "How do you come to know it?",
  "29043": "She was confined at your house, was she not?",
  "29044": "Then why didn't you come to me to wipe them for you?",
  "29045": "Do you know who I am?",
  "29046": "Very well what did I say to you?",
  "29047": "Father, have you any objection to my going away?",
  "29048": "And you are afraid I shall be unhappy?",
  "29049": "To reign in my place and stead?",
  "29050": "I suppose?",
  "29051": "Does the day look clear again?",
  "29052": "What if I were to think a little about others?",
  "29053": "Why on earth did you shut yourself in?",
  "29054": "Do you really suppose?",
  "29055": "Why one to come and one to go?",
  "29056": "Is not that the bishop?",
  "29057": "Why will you ruin yourself, your family, and nation?",
  "29058": "Why such a hard sentence?",
  "29059": "Will he not fancy that the shadows which he formerly saw are truer than the objects which are now shown to him?",
  "29060": "May I go and see her?",
  "29061": "Where did you go this morning?",
  "29062": "So very soon?",
  "29063": "Well, sir, in writing against property, have I done more than quote the language of history?",
  "29064": "I unhappy?",
  "29065": "But do I see a handkerchief?",
  "29066": "You wouldn't have me let that fine fellow work himself to death just for want of a little help, when he is worth a dozen of us lazy chaps, would you?",
  "29067": "But how did he come by his death?",
  "29068": "Can you believe it?",
  "29069": "But if you have big ideas you have to use big words to express them, haven't you?",
  "29070": "Do you think that was done last night?",
  "29071": "Which is the way to the chapel?",
  "29072": "May we, then, be permitted to speak of the past in the present?",
  "29073": "What victim?",
  "29074": "Do we not own the country?",
  "29075": "Raoul, did you ever see anybody hung?",
  "29076": "May I be permitted a word or two of advice?",
  "29077": "If not, where's he gone?",
  "29078": "What would they think of me?",
  "29079": "What says the abbe?",
  "29080": "Might it not be that she would calculate that an interview would thus be possible?",
  "29081": "Why linger to add to the number of the victims of our merciless enemies?",
  "29082": "What is bad?",
  "29083": "And what now?",
  "29084": "Was he actually in hiding from the police?",
  "29085": "Shall he in the meantime risk the character and interest of the nation in the hands of men to whom he can not give his confidence?",
  "29086": "In the tremendous breaking forth of a whole people, in which all degrees, tempers and characters are confounded, delivering themselves, by a miracle of exertion, from the destruction meditated against them, is it to be expected that nothing will happen?",
  "29087": "What's the meaning of this?",
  "29088": "In the first place, what is the gentleman's name?",
  "29089": "Don't you want to go out, and walk around the moon, and pick up diamonds?",
  "29090": "But how was it possible to effect this?",
  "29091": "Will you let me?",
  "29092": "And look you, lord, times are not ill, so wherefore should I risk a change of days?",
  "29093": "That certainly seems a satisfactory explanation, does it not?",
  "29094": "Why, I suppose you'll make a dive for a hatful of diamonds, won't you?",
  "29095": "You have my birth certificate?",
  "29096": "Isn't this mattress hard enough, and the room dull enough, and pain bad enough, but THEY must torture me?",
  "29097": "Is it an odd speech, papa?",
  "29098": "Why don't we go in with them?",
  "29099": "Had you not observed it before?",
  "29100": "Then why didn't I sneeze?",
  "29101": "Who would attend him when he was sick?",
  "29102": "Till to your very doors the war be brought?",
  "29103": "A sleeping draught?",
  "29104": "Philip?",
  "29105": "But they may come any moment, for you left word that I awaited them?",
  "29106": "Why, indeed?",
  "29107": "Shall you?",
  "29108": "But how came the hand to discompose you so much, if it was only a letter of business?",
  "29109": "Why did this sudden conviction of a religious woman cast a terrible doubt in my mind?",
  "29110": "Was that then he or an inhuman thing moved by a lower soul?",
  "29111": "And the power which the eye possesses is a sort of effluence which is dispensed from the sun?",
  "29112": "Does I shin aroun' mongs' de neighbors en fine out which un you de bill DO b'long to, en han' it over to de right one, all safe en soun', de way dat anybody dat had any gumption would?",
  "29113": "What was one to think or feel?",
  "29114": "Can you tell the position of the rooms?",
  "29115": "To defend ourselves against attack?",
  "29116": "The child?",
  "29117": "You will marry me, won't you?",
  "29118": "When shall I have the answer, monseigneur?",
  "29119": "But where does it stay?",
  "29120": "D'you like that?",
  "29121": "You know that to be so?",
  "29122": "Was it possible to render any aid to the dying man?",
  "29123": "Widowed mother, perhaps?",
  "29124": "Has she mentioned me lately?",
  "29125": "And what your sorrow?",
  "29126": "Did you speak, my own?",
  "29127": "Is it only a voice?",
  "29128": "Why wonder about this?",
  "29129": "Did he not advertise?",
  "29130": "In what manner?",
  "29131": "What would they do if they found me?",
  "29132": "But how can I pay them?",
  "29133": "How was this done?",
  "29134": "Away from me?",
  "29135": "And, if so, surely there is good material in you?",
  "29136": "It was he did that, and amn't I a great wonder to think I've traced him ten days with that rent in my crown?",
  "29137": "What was the matter with you, baron?",
  "29138": "May I have the honour?",
  "29139": "Will you come into the garden?",
  "29140": "Will it satisfy them, in the future, if we have nothing to do with invasions and insurrections?",
  "29141": "But what are we to do with her when we have caught her?",
  "29142": "And what do you say of lovers of wine?",
  "29143": "Where now the splendid future of her poor duped children?",
  "29144": "So that is what you wanted the money for?",
  "29145": "Would you like to take her place?",
  "29146": "Was it in the papers yet?",
  "29147": "What had become of that fair fellowship, so closely bound together by public and private ties, so resplendent with every talent and accomplishment?",
  "29148": "Who lives to the left there?",
  "29149": "Where shall we have tea?",
  "29150": "Would she ever die?",
  "29151": "And had the leather interior lasted with the felt cap through seven centuries?",
  "29152": "But why should anyone take it in order to keep it in his house?",
  "29153": "What will happen now?",
  "29154": "Next, how can the posting be accomplished in these mountainous parts?",
  "29155": "Does your soul belong to him now?",
  "29156": "How is man to know?",
  "29157": "And what can I do for you, esteemed prince?",
  "29158": "But this letter in which he recommends you to me?",
  "29159": "What are bulbs?",
  "29160": "Would you like to ferry me over?",
  "29161": "I hope your respected father is well, sir?",
  "29162": "And what, my lord, has been my fault?",
  "29163": "Then what is the illness itself?",
  "29164": "Is that what you've been so funny about this evening?",
  "29165": "But you are half asleep, are you not?",
  "29166": "Of whom?",
  "29167": "And suppose I were to die?",
  "29168": "I wonder where they do go, by the by?",
  "29169": "Is the well where you got this water near at hand?",
  "29170": "And does your honor know the four men who undertook to rescue him?",
  "29171": "Did you still hear the knocking?",
  "29172": "But to what place was I to go?",
  "29173": "Would you work for four and a half a week?",
  "29174": "You have a child?",
  "29175": "Can any man think it would be wise to leave such posts in a situation to be at any instant seized by one or the other of two neighboring and formidable powers?",
  "29176": "Doesn't the name of the country strike you even in the mere mention of it?",
  "29177": "How shall we punish him for such a speech?",
  "29178": "What can be plainer than that the webbed feet of ducks and geese are formed for swimming?",
  "29179": "The sun?",
  "29180": "Diana?",
  "29181": "But who was she?",
  "29182": "Have you been in others?",
  "29183": "But what shall we say of the glee with which the effigy is often carried out, of the sticks and stones with which it is assailed, and the taunts and curses which are hurled at it?",
  "29184": "How died he?",
  "29185": "She asked, if she should call me again?",
  "29186": "You won't mind, will you?",
  "29187": "Have you been there long?",
  "29188": "Do I interrupt?",
  "29189": "But it is quite understood, is it not?",
  "29190": "Will you carry him?",
  "29191": "Neither will he ever break faith where there have been oaths or agreements?",
  "29192": "If he comes back again, father?",
  "29193": "But who can tell what had happened?",
  "29194": "What then, I shall be asked, prevents these things from taking place with such regularity and precision?",
  "29195": "Who is the lady?",
  "29196": "Ain't it good enough to be in your book?",
  "29197": "And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?",
  "29198": "Is it not a just retribution?",
  "29199": "And where are the bodies?",
  "29200": "What do you say to coffee?",
  "29201": "Then we are friends?",
  "29202": "What are you thinking of, D'Artagnan?",
  "29203": "It was four years ago that I had it made, and what do you think I chose for the word and figures?",
  "29204": "Can I have missed it?",
  "29205": "Krajiek could 'a' put it there, couldn't he?",
  "29206": "WHICH candle?",
  "29207": "Shall we take their horses out, or tell them to find friends elsewhere as they best can?",
  "29208": "How much longer will you stay here?",
  "29209": "Is yours a hooky or a nobbly?",
  "29210": "And if he were innocent of any wrong, why did he not do something to clear himself?",
  "29211": "And it is to you, you graceless varlet, I owe all this?",
  "29212": "I have spoken of this because I keep wanting to know for a fact whether other people feel such enjoyment?",
  "29213": "Who is the fellow with him?",
  "29214": "And what will happen now?",
  "29215": "Can we be so unwise as to mean, that she shall keep a navy in our harbours for that purpose?",
  "29216": "Well, I don't think there's anything more, is there?",
  "29217": "Do you think that you are going to stay here?",
  "29218": "Are you going away, or has something happened?",
  "29219": "At the point where the path passes through the gate, you could surely pick up the tracks?",
  "29220": "What have we for lunch?",
  "29221": "Then it's a go, eh?",
  "29222": "What is't?",
  "29223": "Because she was there?",
  "29224": "Can you, of all the people who love her, bear to see her so?",
  "29225": "And if we had not arrived, what would you have done?",
  "29226": "Should you like me to take down his hat to him?",
  "29227": "Honest?",
  "29228": "Are all the flowers dead, or do some of them come again in the summer?",
  "29229": "Can one work there?",
  "29230": "Doing?",
  "29231": "I mean, will you be good to us, or do you intend to eat us?",
  "29232": "Will there be roses?",
  "29233": "Who gives you your maintenance, I pray you?",
  "29234": "What makes you pant so, my friend?",
  "29235": "Is it his fault that he is so ugly, and has so little sense?",
  "29236": "And what due or proper thing is given by cookery, and to what?",
  "29237": "Do you take me vor a shicken ?",
  "29238": "Wot good are you?",
  "29239": "What are you to do?",
  "29240": "And why do you ask that?",
  "29241": "What is it, grandmother?",
  "29242": "What's the good of stopping?",
  "29243": "Had I right, for my own benefit, to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations?",
  "29244": "Have not often the profoundest efforts of genius been used to baffle the aspirations of the reader, to raise false hopes and false fears, and to give rise to expectations which are never realised?",
  "29245": "Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?",
  "29246": "By whose means?",
  "29247": "How much do you own?",
  "29248": "And the lakes, cousin, what do you say of them?",
  "29249": "Why don't you go and fetch things?",
  "29250": "Is that possible?",
  "29251": "What do you mean by lagging and a lifer?",
  "29252": "Are there no honest ones?",
  "29253": "And what is THAT to me?",
  "29254": "Are you unwell today?",
  "29255": "Phips had compromised, and why not he?",
  "29256": "To the office?",
  "29257": "Why should he bear all this?",
  "29258": "Successfully, I hope?",
  "29259": "Have you not heard the astonishing intelligence regarding her surreptitious union?",
  "29260": "Yet, what have I got to do with it?",
  "29261": "Still he's not worth her little finger, is he?",
  "29262": "Is the baby all right?",
  "29263": "Has she been stolen?",
  "29264": "Why must she do it?",
  "29265": "And by what means our news to him repeat?",
  "29266": "What in the world was the meaning of this?",
  "29267": "Is it possible that this stranger has now become everything to me?",
  "29268": "Forgive me, won't you, and let me put the poor brute out of his misery?",
  "29269": "The question arises, what disposition are we to make of our accumulating funds?",
  "29270": "Is it of any use for me to tell you again why we must try to part with the house?",
  "29271": "How comes it that you would not answer my greetings for so long?",
  "29272": "And what did the firm say?",
  "29273": "You do think I could do some good at it, if I were to try?",
  "29274": "But what is to be done, old man?",
  "29275": "As they are or as they appear?",
  "29276": "I didn't do wrong, did I?",
  "29277": "What do I want with them?",
  "29278": "Where is that secretary person?",
  "29279": "What could he do, even supposing himself strong enough to fight the battle?",
  "29280": "Can one be too much alive, too happy?",
  "29281": "Who are to be the objects of popular choice?",
  "29282": "But will not the general be too hospitable for you?",
  "29283": "And that's the lad, sir, is it?",
  "29284": "Which road?",
  "29285": "And me?",
  "29286": "Oh, so it's not time to die yet?",
  "29287": "And how is it he has got this power over you, that you promise to marry him against your will?",
  "29288": "How could the devil from hell himself escape alive?",
  "29289": "Why don't you leave him alone?",
  "29290": "And why so late returned?",
  "29291": "What about leaving that bright boy of yours on guard?",
  "29292": "Did ye ever know this?",
  "29293": "Are you content, my beloved?",
  "29294": "Ye that tell us of harmony and reconciliation, can ye restore to us the time that is past?",
  "29295": "If they had said I was niece to a piping bullfinch, what would you care?",
  "29296": "Have you served under the usurper?",
  "29297": "You would want nothing for so doing?",
  "29298": "What's injudicious, hey?",
  "29299": "Who of you heard his evil song?",
  "29300": "On you?",
  "29301": "Why have you come?",
  "29302": "What have I ever known?",
  "29303": "How many times do I love again?",
  "29304": "Then I may reckon on it, your excellency?",
  "29305": "You have heard me?",
  "29306": "You're the son of one and the nephew of the other?",
  "29307": "And at what date?",
  "29308": "Is he to go up for examination?",
  "29309": "Old lady?",
  "29310": "Have you found it?",
  "29311": "Isn't there any help for it?",
  "29312": "Who speaks for this cub?",
  "29313": "Is it not very unwise in us to go on spending the little money we've got when I can keep down expenditures by an honest occupation?",
  "29314": "What ought they to be allowed, or not allowed, to do, be, and suffer?",
  "29315": "How long have you been there?",
  "29316": "I may well be allowed to ask what has made my maid of honor, who left the festive hall sick, now all at once so well that she goes roaming about the castle in the night time, and in a dress which seems likely to be mistaken for mine?",
  "29317": "Do you wish for a name?",
  "29318": "What, then, prevented charity, union, sacrifice from maintaining themselves in the hierarchy, when the hierarchy might have been only a condition of labor?",
  "29319": "But what, miss?",
  "29320": "Observe, my friends, that in the position occupied by the projectile, an oblique position with regard to the lunar disc, our rockets, in slightly altering its direction, might turn it from the moon instead of drawing it nearer?",
  "29321": "And you never by any chance lose sight of him, I presume?",
  "29322": "Should we go now?",
  "29323": "How is one to vanish partly?",
  "29324": "Who was it that was eaten?",
  "29325": "Can I have another piece?",
  "29326": "Where is the use of the devil in that sentence?",
  "29327": "Whereabouts?",
  "29328": "It is awful, love, isn't it?",
  "29329": "Yet how can I let this knavish dog die and lose the money?",
  "29330": "Or how bear the expense of such a journey?",
  "29331": "I am to drag my present life on, holding its pains at your pleasure, day by day?",
  "29332": "One and all?",
  "29333": "And will the inspection have to be made now?",
  "29334": "You do not understand?",
  "29335": "Always ready?",
  "29336": "Can you get a few men together to go there?",
  "29337": "Shall we allege a musical dispute?",
  "29338": "Is it riveted to the planks?",
  "29339": "What, then, possessed him?",
  "29340": "Have you got it?",
  "29341": "Do you believe you have still a certain amount of it to expend this evening?",
  "29342": "Won't anything make you understand that?",
  "29343": "Wouldn't you rather sit here?",
  "29344": "Then why in the world not?",
  "29345": "What are they then?",
  "29346": "What can you love me for?",
  "29347": "Is he a presentable sort of a person?",
  "29348": "Why do you talk like this to THEM?",
  "29349": "But what was his name?",
  "29350": "What do you mean by gone?",
  "29351": "But why don't you want to take it?",
  "29352": "Is not it what you have often wished to do yourself?",
  "29353": "Would a boat be waiting for us with supplies and letters?",
  "29354": "What must have been his feelings?",
  "29355": "And shall we ever come into our own again?",
  "29356": "What do you want, my pretty?",
  "29357": "Supposing him to be attached to me, would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?",
  "29358": "But suppose she had run against this piece of iron?",
  "29359": "Who will be the jury?",
  "29360": "You think, then, that you can help me more efficaciously than your brothers?",
  "29361": "And do you think it's true?",
  "29362": "Shall there never be a fresh opportunity of trying the ranges of projectiles?",
  "29363": "Did he wake up?",
  "29364": "Was he nice?",
  "29365": "And now what will we do?",
  "29366": "Do you not know?",
  "29367": "And if that were the case would your honor condemn his action?",
  "29368": "And during these days what shall I do?",
  "29369": "Don't the knives hurt?",
  "29370": "Where have you come from and what is your name?",
  "29371": "But how shall we get back?",
  "29372": "How many of the zechins, your father saved, are still left?",
  "29373": "For on what ground can reason base such synthetical propositions, which do not relate to the objects of experience and their internal possibility?",
  "29374": "What are your additions?",
  "29375": "What are the foundations of inequality?",
  "29376": "How did you get it?",
  "29377": "One of those swabs, was he?",
  "29378": "Do you believe he can?",
  "29379": "Who has seen her?",
  "29380": "What did he mean by such a pagan idea?",
  "29381": "Was it because at that time we passed for very rich people, and you were afraid of being refused?",
  "29382": "And besides, what have I done to bring it about?",
  "29383": "Alas, what shall I wretched wight become?",
  "29384": "But suppose it's a woman?",
  "29385": "Why am I to give an account of myself?",
  "29386": "What's that you tell me?",
  "29387": "But you think she wouldn't come?",
  "29388": "What colorable reason could be assigned, in a country so situated, for such vast augmentations of the military force?",
  "29389": "Is this too little?",
  "29390": "For the last three months?",
  "29391": "What could he reply to the deposition of the gendarmes who had arrested him in the very act?",
  "29392": "Where is thy answer, culprit?",
  "29393": "You are recovering again?",
  "29394": "What are you blurting out NOW?",
  "29395": "Shall we yield to force?",
  "29396": "Come, I do not ask for the sake of questioning you, but how did you get in?",
  "29397": "What do you wish, gentlemen?",
  "29398": "What does she?",
  "29399": "What, then, is the use of your worship?",
  "29400": "Was the gate open?",
  "29401": "Shall us begin it now?",
  "29402": "A recruit, sir, I understand?",
  "29403": "Sir?",
  "29404": "Yet could a woman who had done even what she had done deserve all this?",
  "29405": "But who would do it?",
  "29406": "Has not your father already his sixth wife?",
  "29407": "I ask, is it not as good a rule for him as it is for me?",
  "29408": "WHAT do you call him?",
  "29409": "Who is coward now?",
  "29410": "Have they nothing better to do?",
  "29411": "But that's remarkably altruistic of you, isn't it?",
  "29412": "Are you feeling any better?",
  "29413": "Do you think I care more for my dress than for my little girl?",
  "29414": "What man of taste and feeling can endure rifacimenti, harmonies, abridgments, expurgated editions?",
  "29415": "Faucheux?",
  "29416": "And do you think that you would be happy with her, or she with you, after what has passed?",
  "29417": "Do you ask their pardon of me?",
  "29418": "Who can possibly have told you I had had that dream?",
  "29419": "And this is the return you make me for all the indulgences I've heaped on you?",
  "29420": "Why not raise it five more?",
  "29421": "Will you let me tell you?",
  "29422": "Then that part of the soul which has an opinion contrary to measure is not the same with that which has an opinion in accordance with measure?",
  "29423": "You allow me?",
  "29424": "A week?",
  "29425": "And yet what else was she to think?",
  "29426": "Say, was my mother rightly slain or not?",
  "29427": "But where is this devotion?",
  "29428": "Where have I got one?",
  "29429": "Does not that content you?",
  "29430": "And what is the difference?",
  "29431": "Why are you merry?",
  "29432": "If you really cannot come to me will you let me come to you?",
  "29433": "What matters it of whom he spoke?",
  "29434": "What did it matter if the message were not intended for him?",
  "29435": "Was ever a respectable gentleman in such an impasse?",
  "29436": "Peas?",
  "29437": "You won't forget how fond you are of me?",
  "29438": "What's the matter now?",
  "29439": "Where is this great spider of yours now?",
  "29440": "What have you done now?",
  "29441": "Did you see nobody concealed while you were there?",
  "29442": "Besides what have we to do with setting the world at defiance?",
  "29443": "But when her young daughter, sole heiress of a great name and an illustrious title, was suddenly taken away by death from all the expectations and the devotion of her mother, who could dare to offer her consolation?",
  "29444": "It looks as if you were trying to fleece me?",
  "29445": "But why suspect me before the action?",
  "29446": "And you live here?",
  "29447": "What mean you?",
  "29448": "That's good impartial evidence, ain't it?",
  "29449": "Do you think for one moment that this little haystack is enough to feed all the flocks in the whole district?",
  "29450": "What is there more astonishing in all that I have said to you than in what you have told me?",
  "29451": "You will not help me, then?",
  "29452": "Surely you have gone too far?",
  "29453": "But I don't exactly see how we can do that?",
  "29454": "Why should he do it?",
  "29455": "But don't you think she'll know all about it, just the same?",
  "29456": "What is the business you wish to see her about?",
  "29457": "Is there anything more?",
  "29458": "Would you deprive me of one of the most indispensable of my means of livelihood?",
  "29459": "Why, how is this?",
  "29460": "What have made you so down?",
  "29461": "And where may he be now?",
  "29462": "The last time that I see him?",
  "29463": "What is her secret?",
  "29464": "Isn't there some nice girl who'd read and amuse you?",
  "29465": "Have you made this trip before?",
  "29466": "Doesn't that satisfy you?",
  "29467": "I say, stranger, how are ye?",
  "29468": "Is not this so?",
  "29469": "How long were you there?",
  "29470": "Wherein?",
  "29471": "Where, may I ask?",
  "29472": "Who is in this world?",
  "29473": "Doesn't join in with the lads in their games, to get some sort of excitement in this lonely place?",
  "29474": "Well, I wait patiently, do I not?",
  "29475": "Shall I have a cab called?",
  "29476": "And then your negotiations will fail?",
  "29477": "It looks newer than the other things?",
  "29478": "She what?",
  "29479": "Should you like me to stay away?",
  "29480": "What had I to do with him that he should rob me of my sleep?",
  "29481": "Will master come here a moment?",
  "29482": "Can there be an appearance of that which has no form?",
  "29483": "Shall we not?",
  "29484": "Where are you going, you rogue?",
  "29485": "And you are very happy?",
  "29486": "You won't have anything?",
  "29487": "Whither shall I bear my shame?",
  "29488": "What's up, then?",
  "29489": "And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth?",
  "29490": "But why these workingman's clothes?",
  "29491": "And pray what is the ether?",
  "29492": "But there was some one there?",
  "29493": "Have you already in your mind a plan wholly or partially formed?",
  "29494": "Does he gamble?",
  "29495": "And you are certain that the queen and he did not see each other?",
  "29496": "Shall I go up and see?",
  "29497": "What have they come there to do?",
  "29498": "Do you know I think them exceedingly entertaining and strange?",
  "29499": "Will you let me take your arm as far as my own door?",
  "29500": "How's your wound?",
  "29501": "Did you not say that the dog's name was Z?",
  "29502": "Of what use are these dangerous visits, since we can't recognize him?",
  "29503": "You are the officer on duty, lieutenant of the musketeers, are you?",
  "29504": "For the emperor's return?",
  "29505": "Can't you see you've made a mistake?",
  "29506": "Can we safely base our action upon any such vague inference?",
  "29507": "Did tha' do anythin' extra to make thysel' so strong?",
  "29508": "Or do ye go in bare bones, as I may say?",
  "29509": "Now, what is the evidence presented to this body by one of its committees?",
  "29510": "Liza, do you despise me?",
  "29511": "Come, are you ready?",
  "29512": "Has she ever had any experience?",
  "29513": "What does he want, then?",
  "29514": "And why should it be set aside?",
  "29515": "You see?",
  "29516": "Is not that the empress with him there?",
  "29517": "We only want to find out whether it is yes or no, don't we?",
  "29518": "For everything?",
  "29519": "Is it in anger or in spite that you wish to go?",
  "29520": "Paid everybody?",
  "29521": "Will the greedy gullet of the penitentiary be satisfied with swallowing him instead of all of them, if they should venture to obey him?",
  "29522": "You will come and see me again before you go, chevalier?",
  "29523": "Why should you say such desperate things?",
  "29524": "You must promise me you'll tell no one else?",
  "29525": "It isn't putting you out or upsetting your plans, I hope, or anything on those lines?",
  "29526": "What's that?",
  "29527": "Not here?",
  "29528": "Birdsburg?",
  "29529": "The count, then, is in the chateau?",
  "29530": "What did you go to the bandstand for?",
  "29531": "But what do you mean by living only for yourself?",
  "29532": "Why, know you not?",
  "29533": "Don't you love me?",
  "29534": "But may I not see my poor child?",
  "29535": "Where find sufficient strength of mind to determine to begin the search, when her habits are fixed, and vanity has long ruled her chaotic mind?",
  "29536": "Gone down again?",
  "29537": "Whither are you going?",
  "29538": "How is that letter signed?",
  "29539": "I know you'll excuse the precautions of affection, won't you?",
  "29540": "After all, what's the odds between me and you?",
  "29541": "What rule of political morals trampled under foot?",
  "29542": "Does he play?",
  "29543": "Steerforth?",
  "29544": "Can I help loving him?",
  "29545": "And where was it?",
  "29546": "What will they leave him?",
  "29547": "Can any person who is acquainted with his character and with his whole policy doubt that, if the neighbouring powers would have looked quietly on, he would instantly have risen in his demands?",
  "29548": "How can I cross the desert?",
  "29549": "How did you get the idea?",
  "29550": "You were going to drink my wine?",
  "29551": "What's 'cordeon?",
  "29552": "Will you let me?",
  "29553": "Meet?",
  "29554": "Where are you going to next?",
  "29555": "Would it not be so, mother, if we were to meet him in fact?",

  "29557": "Will she find an excuse for the neglect of the knight in the duty of a soldier?",
  "29558": "Why should he shun it?",
  "29559": "Who is safe, if she be convicted of crime?",
  "29560": "Or who so safe from injury as the brother of the great?",
  "29561": "But where did you gather your wisdom?",
  "29562": "What's become of him?",
  "29563": "Do you guarantee it?",
  "29564": "When shall I have done weeping?",
  "29565": "And will she go about in a plain shawl, and a large straw bonnet, carrying tracts and bone soup to her husband's poor parishioners?",
  "29566": "How's the cream of clerkship, eh?",
  "29567": "Can't you wait until dark?",
  "29568": "But what the devil are you hurrying about?",
  "29569": "Are you afraid?",
  "29570": "Why impossible?",
  "29571": "Ah, indeed, vicomte?",
  "29572": "Did she own to herself how different the real man was from that superb young hero whom she had worshipped?",
  "29573": "Has papa gone to bed?",
  "29574": "Must babus do their work on polished teak?",
  "29575": "What is the difference between everlasting bliss, changeless and monotonous, and everlasting suffering?",
  "29576": "What makes you stick your chin up and look in that way?",
  "29577": "Don't I know that at the rate we are living our means won't last long?",
  "29578": "Did he catch sight of himself, therefore much despised by his late political associates?",
  "29579": "Do you mean especially this kind?",
  "29580": "I presume you grew weary of the amusement and dropped it, didn't you?",
  "29581": "And what shall it be to drink?",
  "29582": "How long th' assaults of grief and woes abide?",
  "29583": "Had they run away?",
  "29584": "Not even that?",
  "29585": "What have you been thinking of all this time?",
  "29586": "Have you had it sent where we are to go for it?",
  "29587": "Church?",
  "29588": "So soon?",
  "29589": "Did you hope to escape it because you were four times guilty?",
  "29590": "And these tablets are brought to you that you may add your prayers to those of the faithful, are they?",
  "29591": "Will you bet?",
  "29592": "And you intend to ask him?",
  "29593": "Have you got the entree?",
  "29594": "And what are these masons?",
  "29595": "What may you call his nose, now, my dear?",
  "29596": "What was it you told me?",
  "29597": "Was it you who asked him to drink some of it?",
  "29598": "What about this umbrella?",
  "29599": "But why, silence?",
  "29600": "Scott?",
  "29601": "Who has it?",
  "29602": "Do you think me an utter fool?",
  "29603": "You remember what a beautiful night it was?",
  "29604": "In life?",
  "29605": "Not as a waiter?",
  "29606": "How did you proceed?",
  "29607": "Had it been all his fault?",
  "29608": "Who are you, and why do you seek me?",
  "29609": "Where I put it?",
  "29610": "A'n't I a lonely, forlorn widower?",
  "29611": "What were they doing, and why did they not instantly give the alarm?",
  "29612": "What happened before?",
  "29613": "Then he studied it over and said, couldn't I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl?",
  "29614": "Why will you look at matters in so unfriendly a light?",
  "29615": "Have you asked her?",
  "29616": "Darling one, will you be drawn?",
  "29617": "Who knows?",
  "29618": "And how did the thing happen?",
  "29619": "Will it do us any good, mother?",
  "29620": "A correspondence letter, senor?",
  "29621": "What else did he do?",
  "29622": "Can I help showing that I know what she told me?",
  "29623": "Who can be at enmity with one who loves them, who that is himself gentle and free from envy will be jealous of one in whom there is no jealousy?",
  "29624": "Do you side with him in this?",
  "29625": "Perhaps you would prefer being alone?",
  "29626": "Where were his flatterers now?",
  "29627": "Must I move on, sir?",
  "29628": "And he deceived you, and then deserted?",
  "29629": "Or would it worry you just now?",
  "29630": "Does she say anything about him?",
  "29631": "In the queen's name?",
  "29632": "But how can you expect her to keep her promises better than her more enlightened mistress?",
  "29633": "Is she coming again?",
  "29634": "Which shall it be?",
  "29635": "Danecamp?",
  "29636": "Or, when the monarchy is a child, where then is the wisdom?",
  "29637": "Can she give lessons in anything?",
  "29638": "May the testimony of a whole people be slighted, my master?",
  "29639": "Nervous about you?",
  "29640": "What business is that of yours?",
  "29641": "Is it so?",
  "29642": "Why should he be missing?",
  "29643": "Must I sink down there, and die at once?",
  "29644": "What chance has dead knowledge with experience in any of the transactions between man and man?",
  "29645": "Will they not be happier now?",
  "29646": "But how with a gang?",
  "29647": "Is she, then, your sister?",
  "29648": "Do I look fit to be seen with this little brooch?",
  "29649": "Is the reward of virtue bread?",
  "29650": "And will the minister be there?",
  "29651": "Well, what is it, anyway?",
  "29652": "How de do?",
  "29653": "Am I sure?",
  "29654": "How do I mistake it?",
  "29655": "And how many days will make a month?",
  "29656": "For if, as you say, justice is the obedience which the subject renders to their commands, in that case, O wisest of men, is there any escape from the conclusion that the weaker are commanded to do, not what is for the interest, but what is for the injury of the stronger?",
  "29657": "What is that line?",
  "29658": "Of what good is it to recall the semblance of life when I cannot recall the spirit?",
  "29659": "And he did not complain?",
  "29660": "And that?",
  "29661": "And what shall be their education?",
  "29662": "But who are you, pray?",
  "29663": "When did he refuse you anything?",
  "29664": "You will not be so foolhardy as to keep your promise?",
  "29665": "DO I remember her?",
  "29666": "What wonder, then, that his imagination should fail to realise the changes that eight years must have worked?",
  "29667": "But you will love him, papa?",
  "29668": "Is it because the sun is declining to the horizon?",
  "29669": "Do you require my services now?",
  "29670": "So you didn't get it?",
  "29671": "She does play well, doesn't she?",
  "29672": "Does not this comprehend all, in fact?",
  "29673": "See you no difference between my charms and those of other women?",
  "29674": "But what is the danger?",
  "29675": "And have you no remedy for this?",
  "29676": "Have you not seen how shamelessly she favors your rival's suit?",
  "29677": "Shall we bury it again?",
  "29678": "He must have bewitched her, I suppose?",
  "29679": "Why not accord to both equal property?",
  "29680": "Is he a bishop, then?",
  "29681": "Who knows?",
  "29682": "Will you not trust me so far as that?",
  "29683": "Will that be possible?",
  "29684": "McMurdo?",
  "29685": "Fifty pounds?",
  "29686": "You are one of the shipwrecked sailors of the BRITANNIA?",
  "29687": "Can he be dead?",
  "29688": "One hallucination might pass, but two hallucinations?",

  "29690": "About this boy, love, in whose company they say you left?",
  "29691": "And the work of the painter is a third?",
  "29692": "Ginger?",
  "29693": "Have you realized what the verdict at the inquest will be?",
  "29694": "You think I speak from wicked selfishness?",
  "29695": "Is HE safe for an hour or two?",
  "29696": "Did not you think him sadly out of spirits?",
  "29697": "Wasn't she joking?",
  "29698": "And, if the footpath is narrow, do you think one woman would make room for another, or would beg pardon as she sweeps by?",
  "29699": "Really, if the lower orders don't set us a good example, what on earth is the use of them?",
  "29700": "Laws, now, is it?",
  "29701": "And who is that young man beside you?",
  "29702": "Of what importance is the manner, monsieur, in which I have learnt what I know, so that I know it?",
  "29703": "Is it the personal and individual element in us, or the spiritual and universal?",
  "29704": "Why, where was the difficulty?",
  "29705": "Who deluded you?",
  "29706": "If the virtuous should be very few in number, how then shall we act?",
  "29707": "But to what family does it belong?",

  "29712": "And the raiders have never found you here?",
  "29713": "Have you anything to do with it?",
  "29714": "What are your orders?",
  "29715": "Where are your partners, my dears?",
  "29716": "Haven't I a reputation for knowing all about music?",
  "29717": "Fainall, d'ye hear him?",
  "29718": "What do you bring that is good?",
  "29719": "What of the letter?",
  "29720": "But my direction will not be the same as yours, I think?",
  "29721": "Or if we admit a disinterested benevolence in the inferior species, by what rule of analogy can we refuse it in the superior?",
  "29722": "You find the rent too high, do you, sir?",
  "29723": "Then you permit me to go, you are not angry in your heart?",
  "29724": "But I presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally well?",
  "29725": "Has he solved the problem of population?",
  "29726": "Do you despise me for it?",
  "29727": "The count himself?",
  "29728": "Are these waters, then, bare of inhabitants?",
  "29729": "If a layman in giving baptism pour the water before saying the words is the child baptized?",
  "29730": "And about your fits?",
  "29731": "You say you don't?",
  "29732": "Can you spare the time?",
  "29733": "And, in the next place, when called to account for it, did he not disobey their summons?",
  "29734": "What did you come for, then?",
  "29735": "Shall I swear to you, sir?",
  "29736": "What you thinking about?",
  "29737": "Or are they swayed and perverted by the sophistries of worldly policy?",
  "29738": "There isn't a cat in it, for example?",
  "29739": "But could not the cavity be detected by sounding?",
  "29740": "You damned rascal, where do you always hide it?",

  "29748": "Have you ever seen such a creature?",
  "29749": "What makes you believe this?",
  "29750": "What is there so improbable in it?",
  "29751": "Well, what do you say?",
  "29752": "And what besides?",
  "29753": "You know not?",
  "29754": "Was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night?",
  "29755": "What are they then?",
  "29756": "What horror can this be?",
  "29757": "Oh, how can you?",

  "29768": "Fits?",
  "29769": "Now take my arm, will you?",
  "29770": "Can you fly?",
  "29771": "Or of what use is it that this immensity of worlds is visible to man?",
  "29772": "A man mistrustful of everybody?",
  "29773": "Do you think me dupe enough to believe you have not comprehended what it meant?",
  "29774": "Do I know?",
  "29775": "Especially, what do they resemble, if they are born to enjoy life, and feel its blessings?",
  "29776": "Are yer, cocky?",
  "29777": "How shall I get him out of the house?",
  "29778": "Where is your dispatch?",

  "29789": "Come here much?",
  "29790": "But what shall I say?",
  "29791": "To speak to you about me?",
  "29792": "How are things with you?",
  "29793": "Do you not see that it is with religion as with governments, the most perfect of which would be the denial of all?",
  "29794": "When do you sail?",
  "29795": "Where is the water, wife?",
  "29796": "Why should they brighten their tomahawks and sharpen their knives against each other?",

  "29804": "On foot?",
  "29805": "Is it not too?",
  "29806": "What, I suppose you think I don't know you?",
  "29807": "How can what he and you said be untrue?",
  "29808": "Is it that you won't come in because you wish to stand here, and think over the past hours of enjoyment?",
  "29809": "But what of that?",
  "29810": "Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?",
  "29811": "Were we not brought up together?",
  "29812": "Can I bear the consciousness that every endearment he bestows is a sacrifice made on principle?",
  "29813": "Why do you torment me about what you might all see?",
  "29814": "But what do you do on active service?",
  "29815": "Carried off?",
  "29816": "Yes, brigadier?",
  "29817": "Writes for the stage, does he?",
  "29818": "And wherefore were you called away just now?",
  "29819": "How do you find them?",
  "29820": "Where did it come from?",
  "29821": "And do not the natures of men and women differ very much indeed?",
  "29822": "Who was not his friend who had heard him speak once?",
  "29823": "What could I say to them?",
  "29824": "Capitally, warmly said, wasn't it?",
  "29825": "Well, and then?",
  "29826": "You do not find it easy to advise me?",
  "29827": "Is that, in truth, worthy of thanks?",
  "29828": "Come and take a walk, my dear?",
  "29829": "Do you really not know?",
  "29830": "You'll be on hand tomorrow at one o'clock, won't you?",
  "29831": "Why should I risk an imprudent step?",
  "29832": "Husband cross?",
  "29833": "Oh, then you know that the king has arrived?",
  "29834": "What business are you in now?",
  "29835": "Why didn't you tell me before?",
  "29836": "Won't you have a drop of vodka?",

  "29838": "Can I do you any good?",
  "29839": "There was another woman here?",
  "29840": "What made you stay away so long?",
  "29841": "Why are there no cucumber sandwiches?",
  "29842": "For, indeed, who is there alive that will not be swayed by his bias and partiality to the place of his birth?",
  "29843": "Don't I avoid the society of women?",
  "29844": "My orders have been carried out?",
  "29845": "Any success?",
  "29846": "Has your majesty forgotten that the king expects your reply and awaits it in agony?",
  "29847": "It is a wound that confines him to his bed?",
  "29848": "Is that the way to behave to chief galleys?",
  "29849": "How were these double claims to ceremonious respect happening at the same time to be managed?",
  "29850": "What is to be done?",
  "29851": "You dirty scoundrel, is this the way you leave me?",
  "29852": "Would the interior acclivities of the crater be practicable?",
  "29853": "Where is this wedding to take place, and when?",
  "29854": "Is it the physical differences of blood, color and cranial measurements?",
  "29855": "Tell me, is my father living?",
  "29856": "Why do you look so amazed?",
  "29857": "An ape or a man?",
  "29858": "My dear, am I perfectly hideous?",
  "29859": "What is it that you mean?",
  "29860": "Do you know who she was?",
  "29861": "Are these things to be proud of?",

  "29870": "And can't we go, too?",
  "29871": "To go running after servant girls?",
  "29872": "Where are they now?",
  "29873": "What wants there to such a towardly and pregnant soil, but wise and faithful labourers, to make a knowing people, a nation of prophets, of sages, and of worthies?",
  "29874": "Can these things be?",
  "29875": "Is it flowers you are strewing?",
  "29876": "Why don't you stay down town and go to the theatre with me?",
  "29877": "Would you call one of them virtue and the other vice?",
  "29878": "And you met no one?",
  "29879": "Didn't you notice it?",
  "29880": "Numerous?",
  "29881": "But you feel solitude an oppression?",
  "29882": "She's her brother's heir, is she not?",
  "29883": "When do we hear of women, who starting out of obscurity, boldly claim respect on account of their great abilities or daring virtues?",
  "29884": "But where is the old man?",
  "29885": "You recollect that first night, when I was so unpolite and inky?",
  "29886": "But if you will come and live with me, papa?",
  "29887": "You think there is no hope?",
  "29888": "Do you wish to go there?",
  "29889": "Are we all ready?",
  "29890": "What do you want to rush out for this way?",
  "29891": "You don't deny that?",
  "29892": "Where does this animal live, and what is the use of that plant?",
  "29893": "And a man helpin' on her up the bank?",

  "29895": "Holyhead?",
  "29896": "I should be glad to know whether, when I have put on my green robe in spring, the trees do not afterwards do the same?",
  "29897": "Will you?",
  "29898": "Well, aren't we going to get married?",
  "29899": "Then where does the vanity come in?",
  "29900": "But what were you to do with that woman?",
  "29901": "What does that signify, so long as they favor your suit?",
  "29902": "Do you want to stay here all day?",
  "29903": "Have you a pen?",
  "29904": "What's to become of me?",
  "29905": "What is a power, but the ability or faculty of doing a thing?",
  "29906": "Is it?",
  "29907": "Now, was there ever, since men emerged from a state of utter barbarism, an age in which there were no debts?",
  "29908": "Does any one believe that, if the merchants interested in the course of the navigable way had been charged with the enterprise at their own risk and peril, they would have had to do their work twice?",
  "29909": "There are whalers in these quarters, then?",
  "29910": "You went out with them, of course?",
  "29911": "Do they measure the king, too?",
  "29912": "And twisted it into thread?",
  "29913": "Where was he sitting?",
  "29914": "A setback?",
  "29915": "You will call me sister, will you not?",
  "29916": "Had she heard aright?",
  "29917": "Did we reach any goals?",
  "29918": "Whither was it going?",
  "29919": "And, suppose I should wish to be married to the man that I love?",
  "29920": "Did these men arrive here voluntarily or involuntarily, by disembarking on the shore or by being wrecked?",
  "29921": "Are you going too?",
  "29922": "Did you think there was nothing but evil at the bottom of them?",
  "29923": "What would she do?",
  "29924": "This vexes you?",
  "29925": "And what do I see here, monsieur?",
  "29926": "Will he not think that the pleasure of riches is vulgar, while the pleasure of learning, if it brings no distinction, is all smoke and nonsense to him?",
  "29927": "Why should she disappoint those expectations because of the imperious demands of a very highly excited boy?",
  "29928": "Good heavens, why should I?",
  "29929": "For an augury of good or evil?",
  "29930": "What is he doing?",
  "29931": "Why on earth should you doubt them?",
  "29932": "And are we convinced that all of them are generated out of opposites?",
  "29933": "He's got a pretty strong string round your father's leg, by what I hear, eh?",
  "29934": "Please, where ARE the crabs?",
  "29935": "If we had had provisions enough for months, how could we get out of the abyss into which we were being hurled by an irresistible torrent?",

  "29937": "Did you ever see her?",
  "29938": "But what on earth did she mean?",
  "29939": "What besides?",
  "29940": "And why do you stand there gaping?",
  "29941": "It wouldn't show on my eyes tomorrow, would it?",
  "29942": "Contempt, my friend?",
  "29943": "What's the right way to knock?",
  "29944": "Every mornin' do?",
  "29945": "And in what did that which has taken place concern you?",
  "29946": "What could that mean?",
  "29947": "You are her father?",
  "29948": "Are your wife and children destitute of a bed to lie on, or bread to live on?",
  "29949": "What will he do?",
  "29950": "Why disgrace me before the army?",
  "29951": "You came seeking me to make to me certain proposals, but did you make them?",
  "29952": "And why were you crying so just now?",
  "29953": "Then you can't protest the cheque?",
  "29954": "And will you get him first thing in the morning?",
  "29955": "What will you do with the light?",
  "29956": "Have you come up determined not to deal?",
  "29957": "You have heard and understood what your granddaughter has been saying, sir, have you?",
  "29958": "What could they desire beyond their liberty?",
  "29959": "Edlin?",
  "29960": "What shall we do with him?",
  "29961": "Is not thy common talk found aphorisms?",
  "29962": "I should like to deal him a blow, but can I actually do it?",
  "29963": "Do you know what time your father will be back?",
  "29964": "But who, then, is this assassin, this murderer?",
  "29965": "Why did he urge me so little about the princess?",
  "29966": "What is the meaning of their eternal care and worry?",
  "29967": "Were his eyes deceiving him?",
  "29968": "Why this ridiculous mania for affirming that every thing has been said, which means that we know all about mental and moral science?",
  "29969": "And you spoke to him?",
  "29970": "What's the trouble?",
  "29971": "Give who?",
  "29972": "Anything else?",
  "29973": "Are you mad enough to leave this house?",
  "29974": "How long have you been engaged in the practice of medicine?",
  "29975": "What of it?",
  "29976": "Then it will be our duty to select, if we can, natures which are fitted for the task of guarding the city?",
  "29977": "Why not end my misery now rather than drag out a few more wretched days in this dark pit?",
  "29978": "Why did you lend an ear to the temptings of friends?",
  "29979": "What do you understand of the affair?",
  "29980": "Are we to pass the night in the king's room?",
  "29981": "Not about money, I hope?",
  "29982": "Extraordinary, did you say?",
  "29983": "Why should you interfere?",
  "29984": "She doesn't know yet?",
  "29985": "Gania, what are you standing there for?",
  "29986": "But why, of all others, choose these?",
  "29987": "Ever so little did you say, gossip?",
  "29988": "Are you in need of soothsaying?",
  "29989": "An incendiary, then?",
  "29990": "To come at call?",
  "29991": "Have I time?",
  "29992": "Do they live?",
  "29993": "And this is all?",
  "29994": "You mean that you want to go away from me?",
  "29995": "Now, my friends, can the country be saved upon that basis?",
  "29996": "What, billing so sweetly?",
  "29997": "Well, then what of it?",
  "29998": "What would my islanders say when they heard their governor was going, strolling about on the winds?",
  "29999": "And in that case there's no reason on earth why you shouldn't go back?",
  "30000": "But, guardian, may we not hope that a little experience will teach him what a false and wretched thing it is?",
  "30001": "Have you told them to bring the horse?",
  "30002": "Will you then believe, you dear, foolish enthusiast, that I love you, and that it is no demon that rests here in your arms and swears that she loves nothing but you?",
  "30003": "What are we doing?",
  "30004": "Well, did you see them fly?",
  "30005": "What are you up to?",
  "30006": "And that's why you trust him, eh?",
  "30007": "And what does he think of it?",
  "30008": "What sort of an education could they have got in the country?",
  "30009": "How do you go back?",
  "30010": "How old is your sister?",
  "30011": "Who are you, sir, and by what right do you touch this gentleman's papers?",
  "30012": "Were they in the tent?",
  "30013": "Some poaching case, no doubt?",
  "30014": "What is that for?",
  "30015": "On what occasion?",
  "30016": "But were there no reasons why I should avoid you?",
  "30017": "Would it not be of some assistance, if we knew of what substance it is composed?",
  "30018": "Mustn't it be splendid to be remarkable and have compositions written about you after you're dead?",
  "30019": "Had she only been guilty of silence as to his fate?",
  "30020": "Shall I take it down for you?",
  "30021": "What about, papa?",
  "30022": "But I suppose there is no fire?",
  "30023": "Why should she talk of her own unhappiness?",
  "30024": "The whole picture ruined, isn't it so?",
  "30025": "Surely you won't have to make another for me?",
  "30026": "Where do you suppose him to be?",
  "30027": "And what means are ours, of attaining the truth?",
  "30028": "You mean?",
  "30029": "Please, sir, be this note for you?",
  "30030": "Surely I can never have seriously written such a silly motto as that?",
  "30031": "Have you made up your mind when you shall be there yourself?",
  "30032": "Need it go on?",
  "30033": "How can you love a girl, and yet so humiliate her as to throw her over for the sake of another woman, before the very eyes of that other woman, when you have already made her a formal proposal of marriage?",
  "30034": "What was going on in that mind which was so young and yet already so impenetrable?",
  "30035": "Couldn't he have some spark of manhood about him?",
  "30036": "What shall become of this?",
  "30037": "But how was this to be done, when he had no revenue, often not means enough for necessary expenses?",
  "30038": "What steps have you taken?",
  "30039": "But what's the name of your chief?",
  "30040": "And now?",
  "30041": "What was that they said?",
  "30042": "Why should any one murder a man in so clumsy a fashion as by hanging him?",
  "30043": "Stands the wind in that quarter?",
  "30044": "Is it really true, what every one says, that you cut off one of the ogre's arms?",
  "30045": "Should he knock as of old?",
  "30046": "Nothing about the silver calabash he spat into?",
  "30047": "But what availeth it?",
  "30048": "Where then lay the spots of commonness?",
  "30049": "That seems strange to you, doesn't it?",
  "30050": "Who will volunteer for the job?",
  "30051": "How do we stand in point of time, constable, eh?",
  "30052": "Did I not promise?",
  "30053": "Well, who said it was?",
  "30054": "I suppose your people all do this?",
  "30055": "Did anyone send you, sir?",
  "30056": "What then do you know?",
  "30057": "But where could a dog have come from?",
  "30058": "What shall I do with this beastly tumbril?",
  "30059": "Do I excuse her for it?",
  "30060": "Who is it that compels them to borne along?",
  "30061": "Did any of you gentlemen want to have it out with ME?",
  "30062": "Am I not a madman, and therefore irresponsible?",
  "30063": "How am I afraid of myself?",
  "30064": "Where am I?",
  "30065": "Did he before?",
  "30066": "Do you want her?",
  "30067": "To what, then, do we owe these blessings?",
  "30068": "In other words, how, from the nature of universal human reason, do those questions arise which pure reason proposes to itself, and which it is impelled by its own feeling of need to answer as well as it can?",
  "30069": "Runic?",
  "30070": "And would you not say that he is temperate who has these same elements in friendly harmony, in whom the one ruling principle of reason, and the two subject ones of spirit and desire are equally agreed that reason ought to rule, and do not rebel?",
  "30071": "I say, shall we soon be clear?",
  "30072": "Slid, sir, what should you behold in my face, sir, that should move you, as they say, sir, to ask me, sir, if I would sell my rapier?",
  "30073": "Am I worth anything now, since you have got into such high favor?",
  "30074": "Will nothing make you understand?",
  "30075": "And are thy deeds so good?",
  "30076": "This young cavalier, who won't have me?",
  "30077": "Tell me would you rob?",
  "30078": "Ah, it's you?",
  "30079": "Is it possible under the conditions to enlarge the work of practical teaching and practical examination which is the one desire of those who administer the department?",
  "30080": "What more can the devil do than strangle us?",
  "30081": "Anything more?",
  "30082": "What does it matter, when you come to think of it, whether a child is yours by blood or not?",
  "30083": "I passed you on the road?",
  "30084": "And what makes you think?",
  "30085": "Is he come back, then?",
  "30086": "Is their race extinct?",
  "30087": "Why do you cast those anxious looks on each other?",
  "30088": "Finished what, may I ask?",
  "30089": "Why, they say, is he not perfect in his training?",
  "30090": "Just now, don't you find something uncomfortable, disquieting, alarming in the atmosphere of this room?",
  "30091": "Njal went on to ask, whether he had a right of action against all of them, or whether the leaders had to answer for them all in the suit?",
  "30092": "Will you swear it?",
  "30093": "Does your excellency wish for a receipt?",
  "30094": "What experiment?",
  "30095": "How can varieties of soil engender a principle of legislation and politics?",
  "30096": "What do I know about business?",
  "30097": "But what must they deserve, then, who set him to work?",
  "30098": "But why?",
  "30099": "What would you like best to do?",
  "30100": "Meditatin', eh?",
  "30101": "Next time you roust me out, you hear?",
  "30102": "But it's not serious?",
  "30103": "We knew you were going to get married, did we?",
  "30104": "Why make a long story of what took but five minutes to do?",
  "30105": "Why with disgust?",
  "30106": "What mill?",
  "30107": "What evil spirit has taken possession of your heart that you should be so wicked?",

  "30225": "And to feel not exactly dull, but sad?",
  "30226": "Was it near, was it far?",
  "30227": "Wouldn't you, ferryman, like to accept these clothes, which are a nuisance to me, from me?",
  "30228": "Isn't he?",
  "30229": "Neither, I said, can there be any question that the guardian who is to keep anything should have eyes rather than no eyes?",
  "30230": "Damn it, did you then take me along with you for your chaplain, to sing mass and shrive you?",
  "30231": "Your mother won't know, and so what's the harm?",
  "30232": "What is the liberty of the press?",
  "30233": "Would she throw away the inestimable advantage of royal protection?",
  "30234": "In whom can we trust?",
  "30235": "Then how is it that you did not go?",
  "30236": "And what reward have they?",
  "30237": "Shan't we try that?",
  "30238": "Would you care to try it?",
  "30239": "See what, sir?",
  "30240": "What else could I say when he asked me?",
  "30241": "Are you willing to carry us through the air wherever we wish to go?",
  "30242": "Suppose it was all a gigantic mistake?",
  "30243": "Why out of the question?",
  "30244": "Is your secret of enough importance to me to spare your life for it?",
  "30245": "Oh?",

  "30255": "Hadn't I better have a shave?",
  "30256": "How could angels bear the sight?",
  "30257": "You think it then possible that they really won't have returned?",
  "30258": "What's the answer?",
  "30259": "What do you mean by the proposal you made just now?",
  "30260": "I surmise you also are quits?",
  "30261": "What sort of wood is't?",

  "30278": "He will be superintendent?",
  "30279": "Your sentence of death, if any soul hears you?",
  "30280": "What embarrassment?",
  "30281": "How do you do, dear friend?",
  "30282": "Have you got the key, auntie?",
  "30283": "What's a captive?",
  "30284": "Can that, with any sort of justice, be styled a blunder?",
  "30285": "But may I not write a note to tell him why I cannot come?",
  "30286": "Meanin' aour packets?",

  "30290": "You have observed that?",
  "30291": "She and I were like sisters, and now she is gone, will you not let me be like a sister to you in your trouble?",
  "30292": "And is there any opposite to life?",
  "30293": "Well?",
  "30294": "Don't you think that people are most conceited of all about their sensual powers?",
  "30295": "What am I to do if I love nothing but fame and men's esteem?",

  "30329": "I wonder why?",
  "30330": "Would he come and see her in spite of his mother?",
  "30331": "Wouldn't you rather come in here, to me?",
  "30332": "And what did they see?",
  "30333": "What sort of lives do the majority of folk lead?",
  "30334": "What in the act of offering?",
  "30335": "What could I say, what could I do?",
  "30336": "Know you which, of all his wives, possessed these in the highest degree?",
  "30337": "If they do this, how are we to know when they mean what they say, and of what value can their evidence on points of culture be reckoned?",
  "30338": "Then the soul is immortal?",
  "30339": "Yes, yes, it's your sting, and you are a wasp, that's what you are, a wasp, do you hear?",
  "30340": "Can a man be too cruel to his mother's enemy?",
  "30341": "What child can that be?",
  "30342": "We are to meet as usual?",
  "30343": "Why can I not, on the contrary, say ill enough of her to prevent your going to her?",
  "30344": "Shall we say that they represent the actual social will of the community until such time as they are done away with by a successful revolution?",
  "30345": "But there's good art in me?",
  "30346": "Where is the commander in chief?",
  "30347": "And how do you like it?",
  "30348": "And higher still?",
  "30349": "What does that matter to me?",
  "30350": "Shall I tell you how it will be?",
  "30351": "And who are the really clever men, after all?",
  "30352": "For what other reason can you have laid your plans to talk in this way to such a woman as I am?",
  "30353": "It may come to that, that we must leave this place, but till that time comes, why should your young days be clouded?",
  "30354": "You won't do it again, eh?",
  "30355": "Why then does their rump look toward heaven?",
  "30356": "Has he not all the tricks of a demon at his command?",
  "30357": "What intonation of voice?",
  "30358": "You are coming to sup with me, are you not?",
  "30359": "Making ready for a move?",
  "30360": "But you guess it now, do you not?",
  "30361": "What was it he saw that made his heart stand still?",
  "30362": "Wasn't it all for your good, viper?",
  "30363": "Alas, what would become of me who can only atone for evil by doing good?",
  "30364": "Is the case so desperate?",
  "30365": "What did he do that for?",
  "30366": "If it was indeed that she had in her own person a dual existence, what might happen when the two existences became one?",
  "30367": "If there be no water of unchanging fluidity, how can there be the unreal and temporary forms of waves?",
  "30368": "You are here already, are you, my gentleman?",
  "30369": "Who are you, dear?",
  "30370": "Waste?",
  "30371": "Then what would you like to do until your uncle comes back?",
  "30372": "If you can't see it yourself, why try to debar me?",
  "30373": "Bless the girl, what are you shivering about?",
  "30374": "Said he, and stamped with his foot, am I to be questioned thus by such a one as you?",
  "30375": "Then where is he?",
  "30376": "Were you obliged to have medical attendance?",
  "30377": "Has any horse got loose?",
  "30378": "And after him have you had no love?",
  "30379": "Where have you had your information?",
  "30380": "What is your meaning?",
  "30381": "With YOU?",
  "30382": "Who bade the four spirits of the tempest, which have the power to trouble land and sea, north and south, and west and east, vex neither sea nor land nor the trees that grow on it?",
  "30383": "Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?",
  "30384": "What is a man the worse for dying?",
  "30385": "What constitutional maxim is there which applies to the former and not to the latter?",
  "30386": "Shall I arrange?",
  "30387": "Deer?",
  "30388": "Orders?",
  "30389": "He may have reported to you what he pleased, but could not I do the same by him?",
  "30390": "Why doesn't he get something to do?",
  "30391": "Why couldn't he have made up his mind last night?",
  "30392": "Who doubts that?",
  "30393": "Why, to accuse the man, do you address the woman?",
  "30394": "Have I any time to spare?",
  "30395": "Well, what does she want now?",
  "30396": "Haven't you got anything worse than this?",
  "30397": "But do you know why I am saying all this?",
  "30398": "Do you not come in the king's name?",
  "30399": "Shall we dress it here, as usual?",
  "30400": "Why should I fright ye?",
  "30401": "Between whom?",
  "30402": "Will you be my ally, my lady?",
  "30403": "Now then, where's your chief's quarters?",
  "30404": "Is that an aphorism or a cliche?",
  "30405": "What meaneth this restless wagging of her slouchy chaps?",
  "30406": "It gives a lonely man a sort of hankering, doesn't it?",
  "30407": "Ain't you afraid of it, sir?",
  "30408": "And anything else?",
  "30409": "You really won't meet the rest of them?",
  "30410": "How do I know it?",
  "30411": "But what's to be done?",
  "30412": "And why did you never meet the lion or the bear or the leopard in fair fight on equal terms, but were always trying to steal some advantage over them?",
  "30413": "What is a trousseau?",
  "30414": "Where's the burnisher?",
  "30415": "The ruler may impose the laws and institutions which we have been describing, and the citizens may possibly be willing to obey them?",
  "30416": "You did not send to me?",
  "30417": "Monsieur, can you expose me to the cruel trial of never seeing you again?",
  "30418": "The kind that wear skins?",
  "30419": "Who shall say what he did think?",
  "30420": "Yet is it tangible and real wealth?",
  "30421": "Of work as well?",
  "30422": "Would it not be better if the end did come, the very end?",
  "30423": "No, never?",
  "30424": "Has the whelp been playing that game long?",
  "30425": "Is there no mission in thy native land, O planeticose and exallotriote spirit?",
  "30426": "And what has he said to that?",
  "30427": "And your friend still longs to be made a baron?",
  "30428": "Would you tell me, please?",
  "30429": "Did you put any thing particular in it?",
  "30430": "But would the end really be his own convenience?",
  "30431": "I suppose I'd better not come back with him?",
  "30432": "Does a flower appeal to him?",
  "30433": "Yes, she's as good as they make 'em, and she's all the female I possess and spoiled in consequence, aren't you, old girl?",
  "30434": "What do you know?",
  "30435": "What then could I against the will of heaven?",
  "30436": "For if innocence cannot attract common civility, what must guilt expect, when novelty has ceased to have its charms, and changeableness had taken place of it?",
  "30437": "Will you allow me to whisper half a syllable, sir?",
  "30438": "Whence arises this fault?",
  "30439": "Would you like a cup of tea?",
  "30440": "In this state of the case, my friends, why is the country agitated?",
  "30441": "You are rich, then, I suppose?",
  "30442": "But how about the tennis?",
  "30443": "Did he mean that literally?",
  "30444": "Hadn't you better say two fifty?",
  "30445": "If the infected were removed, why not mention it?",
  "30446": "Which is it to be?",
  "30447": "Then he will no more have true opinion than he will have knowledge about the goodness or badness of his imitations?",
  "30448": "You have seen him?",
  "30449": "What men are safe if this is done?",
  "30450": "Does she think so?",
  "30451": "Why don't you ask him?",
  "30452": "Does it hurt to be invis'ble?",
  "30453": "You don't think I do it because I like it, do you?",
  "30454": "Is that correct?",
  "30455": "Girl number twenty, isn't this a prosperous nation, and a'n't you in a thriving state?",
  "30456": "Had you, then, that sum?",
  "30457": "Our lease expires when?",
  "30458": "Who are you who speaks out of the darkness?",
  "30459": "Are they to have the fame of such as they go through, and we the labour?",
  "30460": "Should you also like to be maid of honor?",
  "30461": "What discovery?",
  "30462": "What shall we do with our sleds?",
  "30463": "For tell me, sirs, if you have ever reflected upon it, by how much do those who have gained by war fall short of the number of those who have perished in it?",
  "30464": "What big house is that just ahead, please?",
  "30465": "What will you do with yourself for the time?",
  "30466": "You have kissed the queen's hand?",
  "30467": "But when will that come to pass?",
  "30468": "Will you promise?",
  "30469": "Why do you give me this shame?",
  "30470": "Its name?",
  "30471": "I say, why have you been so rotten since I came back?",
  "30472": "On what subject shall I converse with her?",
  "30473": "Have you taken any precautions?",
  "30474": "You have unmasked this false prince also?",
  "30475": "Were you walking in your sleep?",
  "30476": "Won't you love me?",
  "30477": "Are you aware, sir, that we have gone to enormous expense to resist this iniquitous attempt of yours?",
  "30478": "Will you hold the horse while I stick them on?",
  "30479": "Well, then, I must go?",
  "30480": "Is it the solitary cell you want?",
  "30481": "An't you cold?",
  "30482": "Have you anything to say?",
  "30483": "You were not surprised, I dare say?",
  "30484": "How can I help laws?",
  "30485": "You could not tell vs if his sonne were there?",
  "30486": "Do you mean to say you don't hear anything?",
  "30487": "Who is his master?",
  "30488": "No garters?",
  "30489": "What is it that you think I shall do?",
  "30490": "What, you here too, prince?",
  "30491": "What in the world was this hall used for?",
  "30492": "Who would believe him?",
  "30493": "Offended me, boy?",
  "30494": "You know how to support losses?",
  "30495": "What were they doing now?",
  "30496": "I guess you'll mind your parts o' speech, and study the ACCIDENCE agin afore you let your clapper run arter that fashion, won't you?",
  "30497": "Then we should be able to ascertain if the BRITANNIA had left any traces of her shipwreck there?",
  "30498": "What are you going to flog that man for, sir?",
  "30499": "What is he going to do?",
  "30500": "Now what was the colonel to do?",
  "30501": "May I ask what is the cause of this unseemly noise?",
  "30502": "If it should break forth into a storm, who can insure us that in its progress a part of its fury would not be spent upon us?",
  "30503": "I'm going to be good, but can't you be good running round just as well as sitting still?",
  "30504": "How can we prevent that?",
  "30505": "Can't we go overside a piece?",
  "30506": "Might I come some other day?",
  "30507": "Go for a soldier, do you mean?",
  "30508": "But what did the mere reckoning of years matter when he felt as young in heart as he had been twenty years ago?",
  "30509": "How could a garden be shut up?",
  "30510": "Your wife or your daughter?",
  "30511": "So that you could see he knew what was between the two wretches?",
  "30512": "But who is there in the world that can boast of having fathomed or understood the wavering mind and unstable nature of a woman?",
  "30513": "Did you ever behold streets so insufferably narrow, or houses so miraculously tall?",
  "30514": "How can they know?",
  "30515": "Is it to make me a captain?",
  "30516": "What IS the matter with it?",
  "30517": "Would that surprise you?",
  "30518": "But would he come?",
  "30519": "How do you know I was praying, sir?",
  "30520": "Who looks after the sick here?",
  "30521": "Can'tyou walk yet?",
  "30522": "Who can make him out?",
  "30523": "To whom do I address it?",
  "30524": "But where was mine?",
  "30525": "Am I, indeed, so happy?",
  "30526": "Hemlock, do you mean?",
  "30527": "How could you possibly know that?",
  "30528": "Why so insensible to my uncle's interests?",
  "30529": "And the possibility has been acknowledged?",
  "30530": "Your ruin?",
  "30531": "Do you mean in point of reward?",
  "30532": "But how long have you been here that you are ignorant of all this?",
  "30533": "Haven't you put a drop of poison in that remark now, eh?",
  "30534": "Would there ever come to him a time of freedom?",
  "30535": "Will you bear, therefore, will you bear to see your sanctuary trampled on?",
  "30536": "Even if the squire should afterwards hear of his having been there, what would it matter?",
  "30537": "She said I was prudent and virtuous?",
  "30538": "How are you to get away from here?",
  "30539": "You are confident that the thief came in a cab?",
  "30540": "That's what it always comes to, doesn't it?",
  "30541": "What could he want?",
  "30542": "That was something in this way, warn't it?",
  "30543": "Why not have kept hold of it with both hands, with both knees, when it was about to flee from her?",
  "30544": "But to what does all this lead?",
  "30545": "Hasn't she always you?",
  "30546": "How do the bass chords run?",
  "30547": "Does it mean that the risk is not so great as we who have seen the abnormal and not the normal side of taking risks with icebergs might suppose?",
  "30548": "Shall I send the servant to direct you?",
  "30549": "How much is the whole?",
  "30550": "And who instructed you, eh?",
  "30551": "Do you know anything of his history?",
  "30552": "Was she ever as pretty as my mother is now?",
  "30553": "But the puzzle is, who are the teachers?",
  "30554": "How could you be cruel to me?",
  "30555": "But well carried out, eh?",
  "30556": "How did you fare?",
  "30557": "Who does it come from?",
  "30558": "What happened within her?",
  "30559": "Whom had he to consult but himself now?",
  "30560": "What differences from terrestrial conditions will ensue?",
  "30561": "Are they going to sacrifice the children who seek the learning, or the sick who need medical care, or the families who dwell in squalor now brightened by the hope of home?",
  "30562": "Isn't there a lot of hope in it?",
  "30563": "What stable?",
  "30564": "Do I look ugly?",
  "30565": "To relieve thy breast?",
  "30566": "Can you lift me into that tree and put a rifle in my hands?",
  "30567": "Shall I tell you what you were thinking to yourself just then?",
  "30568": "But what can I have to relate to you?",
  "30569": "Why is that woman always out of the way when she is most wanted?",
  "30570": "I hope you don't mind?",
  "30571": "What right had they to make me suffer like that?",
  "30572": "How long do you suppose this sea to be?",
  "30573": "Do you desire it as ardently as you say?",
  "30574": "If nature suddenly should give that beast a tail, would he not be prouder of it than all the other foxes in the wood?",
  "30575": "Watch and listen, won't you, so that you can give me your impression after the first act?",
  "30576": "Who could have said so the evening before?",
  "30577": "Very good?",
  "30578": "Are you likely to be more humane to me than others were yesterday?",
  "30579": "Was it my imagination that there was an undertone of fear rather than of hope in the question?",
  "30580": "What could have caused it?",
  "30581": "Is he a scholar, or a soldier?",
  "30582": "And to confer upon me the favour of your distinguished recommendation?",
  "30583": "How can he keep him?",
  "30584": "Surely you have felt that it is so?",
  "30585": "Could there be a development of knowledge in the absence of curiosity?",
  "30586": "Do the old fellows bother you?",
  "30587": "If what?",
  "30588": "And how have you been getting on?",
  "30589": "But you, sir?",
  "30590": "Did you see?",
  "30591": "Who is your favorite author?",
  "30592": "You think this old monkey in here knows what you say?",
  "30593": "What would you gain by it?",
  "30594": "You've been picking the flowers, hey?",
  "30595": "But are you so sure, so very sure of her?",
  "30596": "If I get your grandpa to apologize for the shaking, will you give up running away?",
  "30597": "Who's here?",
  "30598": "Don't you think that this has lasted long enough?",
  "30599": "Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring?",
  "30600": "And it is asked by what authority this bold and radical innovation was undertaken?",
  "30601": "I asked him upon this if he ever disputed with his wife?",
  "30602": "Sirrah, who gave you a commission to lie in my lordship?",
  "30603": "How can I tell?",
  "30604": "How could I let him?",
  "30605": "What hand and brain went ever pair'd?",
  "30606": "Why did you write me such a horrid letter, you naughty boy?",
  "30607": "Or can I ever see one?",
  "30608": "Quite?",
  "30609": "What is she vexed with him about?",
  "30610": "Has it not happened to all of us, in certain supreme conjunctures, to stop our ears in order that we may not hear the reply, after we have asked a question?",
  "30611": "To do that, my joy?",
  "30612": "And later?",
  "30613": "But what language is it?",
  "30614": "Wouldn't YOU?",
  "30615": "Lucy dear, do you know why I tell you all this?",
  "30616": "How did they come to love each other?",
  "30617": "But what are you going to do to repay us for the past?",
  "30618": "Got any views on the subject?",
  "30619": "Of the duke?",
  "30620": "What means all this?",
  "30621": "Will you stay here if the enemy occupies the place?",
  "30622": "For how shall I be able, said he, to rule over others, that have not full power and command of myself?",
  "30623": "Go?",
  "30624": "Have I deserved to be called an elderly person?",
  "30625": "Is it because we are calculated to walk?",
  "30626": "Why ask about the next but one?",
  "30627": "Can we have the butler in for a moment?",
  "30628": "Wasn't it good of him?",
  "30629": "What prodigies be these?",
  "30630": "Who suffers by his ill whims?",
  "30631": "Do you hear the news?",
  "30632": "Is there any one who understands human and political virtue?",
  "30633": "Won't you go with me?",
  "30634": "What did she see there?",
  "30635": "The postilion?",
  "30636": "What ancient nation, as the same author asks, can be named that was originally monogamous?",
  "30637": "What can I do to do myself justice upon her?",
  "30638": "Your letter is like you, and what could I say of it that would be higher praise than that?",
  "30639": "You would not be cruel to me?",
  "30640": "Is everything here purple?",
  "30641": "Do you think we did well in using the adder's fat?",
  "30642": "When to be made payable?",
  "30643": "Is she married, my dear?",
  "30644": "Anyone about?",
  "30645": "Why this religious depreciation of labor, if it is true, as economic science already shows, that labor is the father of love and the organ of happiness?",
  "30646": "Oriental?",
  "30647": "Are we going to see the court?",
  "30648": "So why should he have made such a sacrifice?",
  "30649": "Hrut asked him what news?",
  "30650": "What accursed philosophy stands in your way?",
  "30651": "And have you been up there?",
  "30652": "But why do you give them me?",
  "30653": "What was his own inward definitive response to the unbribable interrogatory of fatality?",
  "30654": "Is not the land more faithful?",
  "30655": "I wonder if it is mine?",
  "30656": "If you demand WHY?",
  "30657": "Allow me to ask you, prince, since you cherish those intentions, how you consider that you will provide for my happiness?",
  "30658": "Who among them can do it so well?",
  "30659": "And upon what will the tax be levied?",
  "30660": "If wandering beyond hearing of her peculiar call, they are overtaken by a storm or attacked by an enemy, what can they do but in the one case droop and die, and in the other submit to be torn to pieces?",
  "30661": "Can't you see that he humbugs you just as much as ever he pleases?",
  "30662": "What would the gain be to me if I were healed and you not?",
  "30663": "The moonlight than the fog of frost?",
  "30664": "Where is he hiding?",
  "30665": "Why did not you say so then?",
  "30666": "What do you mean, sir?",
  "30667": "Would you like me to help you tonight?",
  "30668": "Why how you talk?",
  "30669": "Was there any lady of the house?",
  "30670": "For from what impression coued this idea be derived?",
  "30671": "Where did you get that onion?",
  "30672": "And shall we arrive there?",
  "30673": "Don't you see that he doesn't want to be followed?",
  "30674": "Is it about my husband?",
  "30675": "Does anybody bring up other people's children?",
  "30676": "What's the use of our wasting another year?",
  "30677": "Stolen diamonds?",
  "30678": "Mary, what do you think is going to happen?",
  "30679": "Well, what have you to say to me?",
  "30680": "Have you a cabriolet that you can let me have?",
  "30681": "What is it to you what he signs?",
  "30682": "She didn't tell you so?",
  "30683": "And where did you run into her, my good girl?",
  "30684": "Have there not been governments which were blind leaders of the blind?",
  "30685": "Who's me?",
  "30686": "Gave him?",
  "30687": "You are an extraordinary woman, why should you follow the ordinary course, the ordinary life?",
  "30688": "What may I hope for?",
  "30689": "But why are these two lords such enemies?",
  "30690": "How many women in these days would think of doing that?",
  "30691": "How is your hand?",
  "30692": "What ails you?",
  "30693": "Is it not strange that people can laugh, amuse themselves, be joyful under that eternal certainty of death?",
  "30694": "Yours or mine?",
  "30695": "And may we not say confidently of man also, that he who is likely to be gentle to his friends and acquaintances, must by nature be a lover of wisdom and knowledge?",
  "30696": "Well, daughter, say, what is thy suit with us?",
  "30697": "What was the reason of this disappointment?",
  "30698": "Where am I?",
  "30699": "Where did they both come from?",
  "30700": "I, where?",
  "30701": "What sort of knowledge is there which would draw the soul from becoming to being?",

  "31485": "Sorry for what?",
  "31486": "Besides, is there any reason why the social will should be blind to the fact that men generally do desire to gain pleasure and to avoid pain?",
  "31487": "What o'clock was it?",
  "31488": "And do you believe that I love you with all my heart and all my strength and all my soul?",
  "31489": "Why do you change like this?",
  "31490": "Is it a broad sheet of water?",
  "31491": "Do you understand this feeling?",
  "31492": "Where does that man live?",
  "31493": "Would you be willing to sell your inn?",
  "31494": "What do you want to do with him?",
  "31495": "Then you ARE going to be married, sir?",
  "31496": "What means your ladyship?",
  "31497": "What, then, is a race?",
  "31498": "She wasn't by any chance one of the samurai?",
  "31499": "To whom does it belong?",
  "31500": "But why is this man absent?",
  "31501": "What sundial?",
  "31502": "Could this too be a proud rejection of sympathy and help?",
  "31503": "A fine room, is it not?",
  "31504": "Do I?",
  "31505": "If there is no love, what is there?",
  "31506": "Will you kiss me on it then?",
  "31507": "Why stay ye not when ye come?",
  "31508": "What do you think is the point his negotiations put most forward?",
  "31509": "And then what do you do?",
  "31510": "Is being in love conspiring?",
  "31511": "What do you think he will do?",
  "31512": "Yes or no?",
  "31513": "Do you not see these men still fear you, go in dread of you?",
  "31514": "What do you here on my land?",
  "31515": "Do you care for taters?",
  "31516": "Have you loved many women before me?",
  "31517": "Can you reconstruct the real face from them?",
  "31518": "Shall I?",
  "31519": "Can you ask it?",
  "31520": "Is he a farmer?",
  "31521": "And can ye still his cold remains pursue?",
  "31522": "No, how could she?",
  "31523": "Will you forget me?",
  "31524": "Are little things more subtle than big things?",
  "31525": "In what part of the house?",
  "31526": "My purse?",
  "31527": "What could I do but bow acceptance?",
  "31528": "Is there anyone with her?",
  "31529": "Replied I, what can I say?",
  "31530": "And your tongue does not refuse to utter this, and your heart does not shrink with shame while you do it?",
  "31531": "What am I to do myself?",
  "31532": "Isn't a man's idea usually what he does marry for?",
  "31533": "What does it strike you is the inference?",
  "31534": "On your honor is that true?",
  "31535": "And did he go home?",
  "31536": "But, comte tell me a reason for it?",
  "31537": "What objection could be made to him?",
  "31538": "Brought you down from whar?",
  "31539": "Why so, my dear child?",
  "31540": "What was he to say to her?",
  "31541": "Isn't he a splendid fellow?",
  "31542": "And where are you going?",
  "31543": "What is yours?",
  "31544": "And what devil made me go to that wat?",
  "31545": "You tell me he burned the letter?",
  "31546": "Jest hear 'em squeal, won't yer?",
  "31547": "And you have corresponded with her all this while?",
  "31548": "Madeline, my dear, I didn't know this person was in your debt?",
  "31549": "What brought it to pass?",
  "31550": "Why sit we not?",
  "31551": "What do you bewail, then, and why do you weep?",
  "31552": "Do you know what's going to become of YOU?",
  "31553": "Why, why' have I made this evening such a point of our not all dining together?",
  "31554": "Don't you see that bank of dark blue cloud over there which means a nice softening rain in the night and a jolly good breakfast of worms in the morning?",
  "31555": "Falling?",
  "31556": "Whatten penance will ye dree for that?",
  "31557": "Was he going to rebuild?",
  "31558": "What could he be dreaming of?",
  "31559": "And you won't tell me what you want it for?",
  "31560": "Have you heard if he was much hurt?",
  "31561": "And how so?",
  "31562": "What do I make of it?",
  "31563": "All that tempest, all that cloud, that war, then that peace?",
  "31564": "But what motive had they in advising, from which so great a disaster was the result?",
  "31565": "What is the news?",
  "31566": "Well, then, what does the rest of 'em do?",
  "31567": "How else do you think I could educate them at all?",
  "31568": "How far is it now to the inn?",
  "31569": "Why do you feel so bad about that affair of this morning?",
  "31570": "Do you know the relief that my disappearance will be?",
  "31571": "Do you think so now?",
  "31572": "Or will he be carried away by the stream?",
  "31573": "Have you forgotten that when you were in trouble I did everything for you?",
  "31574": "But what is it, then, that I am accused of?",
  "31575": "Odd, wasn't it?",
  "31576": "Have you ever really loved anybody?",
  "31577": "Or that night, when I frowned at him?",
  "31578": "With the prince still?",
  "31579": "And a young lover come and carried off the bride, eh?",
  "31580": "If a man had stolen a pound in his youth and had used that pound to amass a huge fortune how much was he obliged to give back, the pound he had stolen only or the pound together with the compound interest accruing upon it or all his huge fortune?",
  "31581": "Do you recognize that, miss?",
  "31582": "Had not all the other places refused her because she did not know something or other?",
  "31583": "What could be the trouble?",
  "31584": "Sparsit, ma'am?",
  "31585": "Han't they telled ye that he'll help ye, and ye can go to heaven, and have rest, at last?",
  "31586": "But isn't he ugly?",
  "31587": "Oh, is that it?",
  "31588": "Can't he speak?",
  "31589": "Well, then, how is it that your eminence complained just now of want of information?",
  "31590": "What would they say, who made so light of money, if they could know how I had scraped my halfpence together, for the purchase of my daily saveloy and beer, or my slices of pudding?",
  "31591": "Had he the right to compel this sacrifice, knowing, realizing, as he did, that his child had based all the happiness of her life on the career she was now voluntarily giving up for his sake?",
  "31592": "Here, on the verandah?",
  "31593": "And how could this be properly explained to the young lady in gentle terms?",
  "31594": "Do you think it's because I'm really bad and unregenerate?",
  "31595": "Are you not?",
  "31596": "Then how about our position?",
  "31597": "And will he not?",
  "31598": "What recompense can we present?",
  "31599": "You won't be very cross, will you?",
  "31600": "The principle is the same, I think?",
  "31601": "What happens in so many cases?",
  "31602": "You are a precious set of people, ain't you?",
  "31603": "Then we must have known equality previously to the time when we first saw the material equals, and reflected that all these apparent equals strive to attain absolute equality, but fall short of it?",
  "31604": "Why don't you send home for another?",
  "31605": "And since then?",
  "31606": "And as to her face, could it inspire nothing but passion?",
  "31607": "What was it then, and how had it affected his fate?",
  "31608": "Manager to a diamond merchant, or some such thing, is he not?",
  "31609": "And he does forgive?",
  "31610": "When all that failed, he boldly accosted him, and asked him, whether he did not remember him?",
  "31611": "Or, whither he should go?",
  "31612": "But we shall see you at the musicale this afternoon, shall we not?",
  "31613": "Should possibilities be worse to bear than certainties?",
  "31614": "Has the post come in?",
  "31615": "And when is this to be consummated?",
  "31616": "And what did they say?",
  "31617": "Is there a single sentiment it does not condemn?",
  "31618": "What are you stopping for?",
  "31619": "Do you want to work?",
  "31620": "Why are we now in the mansions of the rich and great, my friends?",
  "31621": "Are there many more?",
  "31622": "Didn't you take your story out of THE SEA LION?",
  "31623": "You can stay some time?",
  "31624": "The other side of WHAT?",
  "31625": "And you swim?",
  "31626": "Was he commencing to suspect?",
  "31627": "And in like manner does the touch adequately perceive the qualities of thickness or thinness, or softness or hardness?",
  "31628": "When you came in at the gate and asked the watchman the way here, had you any one with you?",
  "31629": "Won't you speak to me?",
  "31630": "Where did your instructions come from?",
  "31631": "Why, then, monseigneur does not know?",
  "31632": "But, gentlemen, why are you getting angry again?",
  "31633": "And now it is you who have brought them together again?",
  "31634": "Was there not a spirit in him which, silent as it was, burned on him like the fires of perdition?",
  "31635": "Hurt you?",
  "31636": "What visions, they asked, could one but read them, must lie behind the quiet, dreaming eyes of that inscrutable face?",
  "31637": "What resources could they expect to find upon that scene of desolation?",
  "31638": "May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?",
  "31639": "Are you reconciled?",
  "31640": "Are you nothing?",
  "31641": "But what could have frightened the creatures so, and driven them from their haunts, when they ought to have been quietly sleeping?",
  "31642": "Or would you include the mixed?",
  "31643": "Was it a screw or thrust?",
  "31644": "Ah, then, is THAT what you've stayed over for?",
  "31645": "Do you know that he's the honestest and faithfullest fellow that ever lived, and that he has an irreproachable good name?",
  "31646": "What do you think of it, now?",
  "31647": "Why not?",
  "31648": "Always busy at what?",
  "31649": "How is it possible for him to be attained to?",
  "31650": "Fine, isn't it?",
  "31651": "Is it finished?",
  "31652": "What do you mean?",
  "31653": "He was to be another father to him, and they were all to live together in a garden of roses, weren't they?",
  "31654": "Do you hesitate?",
  "31655": "Is there any one in the lobby?",
  "31656": "I like the baron, but what better gifts can marriage bestow, than I already possess?",
  "31657": "Is not that saying illustrated by this?",
  "31658": "What's he?",
  "31659": "Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?",
  "31660": "Silver?",
  "31661": "Are we going to continue this pace all night?",
  "31662": "Can I be so lucky as to find what everybody is seeking for?",
  "31663": "Face?",
  "31664": "What else have you done?",
  "31665": "Haven't you given her any warning of your arrival?",
  "31666": "It stung you up a bit when I spoke of your game leg, young fellow?",
  "31667": "Sire, will you allow me to speak frankly as befits a loyal soldier?",
  "31668": "Then why speak to me about it?",
  "31669": "What the devil do I do?",
  "31670": "Who would ever know?",
  "31671": "Well, but they'll see how small you are afterwards, won't they?",
  "31672": "Was I very gleeful, settled, content, during the hours I passed in yonder bare, humble schoolroom this morning and afternoon?",
  "31673": "Who will shrive the poor wretch, if you have come away from him?",
  "31674": "Why should I do so?",
  "31675": "And then she could not help remembering that he had passed some time with her under like circumstances, so why should there be any unfitness in the fact?",
  "31676": "Is there no mistake?",
  "31677": "Must he not have the qualities of a sage?",
  "31678": "You don't want to?",
  "31679": "Why is the sycophant thus added to the hypocrite, and the man who pretends to govern, sunk into the humble and submissive memorialist?",
  "31680": "Well, have we attained our end there also?",
  "31681": "From the dry rock who bade the waters flow?",
  "31682": "Do you observe that we were not far wrong in our guess that temperance was a sort of harmony?",
  "31683": "Whatever her sins, they were not sins of intention, but of inadvertence, and why should she have been punished so persistently?",
  "31684": "What was the bargain?",
  "31685": "And his dog also?",
  "31686": "Must I call you a liar as well as a thief?",
  "31687": "Why did you bring me here?",
  "31688": "If he could not speak, how was she to do so?",
  "31689": "And he will accomplish the trip?",
  "31690": "Is he mad?",
  "31691": "What is she there for?",
  "31692": "YOU insulted ME?",
  "31693": "Will you come along home wi' me, and see my wife?",
  "31694": "And now, matey, did that doctor say how long I was to lie here in this old berth?",
  "31695": "My companion?",
  "31696": "For how can one?",
  "31697": "Game for a morning drive?",
  "31698": "You know where you left the team?",
  "31699": "How much have you lost?",
  "31700": "The boy's name?",
  "31701": "Why do you want to start on that again?",
  "31702": "And you yourself, what do you think about it?",
  "31703": "Why do you say I do not regard it?",
  "31704": "Must we, then, give up to despair?",
  "31705": "But where the devil are you?",
  "31706": "Living?",
  "31707": "Do you know what you have said?",
  "31708": "But where the devil were you gladding last night, my young master?",
  "31709": "Well, and what has she been doing?",
  "31710": "You think I can't shoot me a fox?",
  "31711": "Shall we not spend our immortal life together?",
  "31712": "Would this political deterrence prove acceptable to allies and to our own public?",
  "31713": "Should not all they be called mercenary who are always seeking consolations?",
  "31714": "Where is it, then?",
  "31715": "Do you really mean that?",
  "31716": "How could you get across?",
  "31717": "Can I take her into the spare room to lay off her hat when she comes?",
  "31718": "I did not know his wife, but she was a woman, wasn't she?",
  "31719": "In case of doubt, shall it award the property to the first occupant?",
  "31720": "And the sago?",
  "31721": "You have not wanted for anything, vicomte, in my absence, have you?",
  "31722": "Who knows the will of heaven?",
  "31723": "What's that?",
  "31724": "Who's the object of your meditation, sir?",
  "31725": "Would you not say that he is entirely concerned with the soul and not with the body?",
  "31726": "Have we not?",
  "31727": "What does she think herself about him?",
  "31728": "Do you hate me so much as all that?",
  "31729": "Is not this to be rich?",
  "31730": "Should you like to retire at once?",
  "31731": "Will you ever go back?",
  "31732": "Why conceal your real feelings?",
  "31733": "In a hospital?",
  "31734": "Have you no information as to his abiding place?",
  "31735": "What is come of the troops that were encamped beside my palace?",
  "31736": "What's your names?",
  "31737": "For what reason is all this fume and fury?",
  "31738": "Of the painter we say that he will paint reins, and he will paint a bit?",
  "31739": "Will you ride on a few paces with the princess?",
  "31740": "How dare the stranger trample on thy soil with haughty foot?",
  "31741": "Can you wash your own hands, or shall I wash them for you?",
  "31742": "Will it not serve for a gentleman's name, when the signior is put to it, ha?",
  "31743": "And when shall we have the honor of seeing you again, your excellency?",
  "31744": "Are you interested in the sugar question?",
  "31745": "And they will go in three days now?",
  "31746": "But what good could he have done if he had?",
  "31747": "And what probability was there that a mere drudge would be able to manage a large and stormy assembly, abounding with able and experienced men?",
  "31748": "Gave him leave?",
  "31749": "You have, then, overheard our conversation?",
  "31750": "Will they sacrifice opportunity for the distressed, the beauty of our land, the hope of our poor?",
  "31751": "Suicide?",
  "31752": "Esther, will you forgive me?",
  "31753": "Was this not preventing any inquiry, and, at the same time, assuming a higher ground through this pretended fascination exercised over a man who must have been of warlike nature and accustomed to receive homage?",
  "31754": "For what end are her fair complexities, her changes of soil, her sinuous coast?",
  "31755": "What was to be done with them?",
  "31756": "You are sure you won't join me?",
  "31757": "Why didn't he?",
  "31758": "What must I know?",
  "31759": "Is it good?",
  "31760": "Would you four stand up for a moment?",
  "31761": "Is it not on this order of release?",
  "31762": "And, still further, I am tempted to inquire what has become of the indigent scholars, the sons of the masses of the people whose daily labour just suffices to meet their daily wants, for whose benefit these rich foundations were largely, if not mainly, instituted?",
  "31763": "There is nothing in my house for you, do you hear?",
  "31764": "On what ground shall we persuade the contented egoist, who has but a handful of commonplace desires and finds it possible to satisfy most of them, that it is better to call into being a multitude of wants many of which will probably remain unrealized?",
  "31765": "Do you hear now?",
  "31766": "What fog?",
  "31767": "Who was there present?",
  "31768": "What interest, I say, what interest do you ask?",
  "31769": "Not sick, are you?",
  "31770": "But what if I were mistaken?",
  "31771": "Then do you yourself know?",
  "31772": "Why should you, of all people, be so passionate about it?",
  "31773": "Would YOU like cats if you were me?",
  "31774": "Once more, will ye stay?",
  "31775": "Fifty cents a pound, was it?",
  "31776": "Do you acknowledge your faults?",
  "31777": "How can its error, being universal, be capable of correction?",
  "31778": "Isn't that so, captain?",
  "31779": "What had fate in store for these daring adventurers?",
  "31780": "Who do these three cavaliers appear to you to be?",
  "31781": "Or be a clerk or lawyer?",
  "31782": "How did you know?",
  "31783": "Don't you want any more of it?",
  "31784": "And how could I do that, unless so be I was there myself?",
  "31785": "Are you still intimate with her?",
  "31786": "I might, mightn't I?",
  "31787": "Or I my brains?",
  "31788": "Has anyone assaulted you?",
  "31789": "Whose?",
  "31790": "Is it in vain our conquering arms subdue?",
  "31791": "Do you suppose I ain't the best judge of what's proper and what's improper?",
  "31792": "That idea is your own, and yours solely?",
  "31793": "Why have you never told me?",
  "31794": "Where are you going now?",
  "31795": "You will not say it?",
  "31796": "What are we going to do?",
  "31797": "How about these papers?",
  "31798": "Will nobody say what is the matter?",
  "31799": "But why should I repine?",
  "31800": "Won't truth serve your turns?",
  "31801": "It IS frightening to be very ill, isn't it?",
  "31802": "I must be trembling, does it not show in my writing?",
  "31803": "How had it come to pass that matters which with others are so private, should with her have become the public property of so large a circle?",
  "31804": "Where is the man who can say the fault, in part, has not been his?",
  "31805": "You would allow, I said, that there is in nature an upper and lower and middle region?",
  "31806": "Well, and what do you think?",
  "31807": "Have we lost the power of rendering you happy?",
  "31808": "Why not, sire?",
  "31809": "Are you sure that you do not falter or fear?",
  "31810": "And what can we do there?",
  "31811": "Want money?",
  "31812": "You're not going to be silly about it, are you?",
  "31813": "And have you ever seen her by any chance?",
  "31814": "Haven't you told him, sir?",
  "31815": "You have heard nothing to the contrary, have you?",
  "31816": "Did you find him, gossip?",
  "31817": "Then you don't think I was foolish?",
  "31818": "Is it all over?",
  "31819": "What's that, sir?",
  "31820": "That you fled from your husband?",
  "31821": "Remember where he said the book was?",
  "31822": "Whence does he come?",
  "31823": "And now, when shall we meet again?",
  "31824": "Did I say anything that was inconsistent with his having seen it before?",
  "31825": "Iron what?",
  "31826": "Can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than laws can among friends?",
  "31827": "Why contend?",
  "31828": "But may not this inference be presumptuous?",
  "31829": "What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant?",
  "31830": "Isn't this ungrateful of you, now?",
  "31831": "And how have you wriggled onto the staff?",
  "31832": "Counting from when?",
  "31833": "What's the matter, then?",
  "31834": "Does he know you are going to be married?",
  "31835": "Didn't you hear me say no?",
  "31836": "The man of the house is a lawyer, is he not?",
  "31837": "Are they not lovely?",
  "31838": "What would you do, then?",
  "31839": "You know monkeys don't swim?",
  "31840": "You remember, I was proclaimed four years ago?",
  "31841": "I suppose you'd be above sittin' down and 'avin' a bit of dinner with us?",
  "31842": "Was he bent, then, upon ruining me?",
  "31843": "Why scare people?",
  "31844": "Where am I to let you know to?",
  "31845": "After all, why wasn't he there?",
  "31846": "Any fault there?",
  "31847": "Where did you get that donkey head?",
  "31848": "Was anybody here just now?",
  "31849": "From whom and what about?",
  "31850": "Barkis?",
  "31851": "Who would these be?",
  "31852": "Of her character?",
  "31853": "Like my father?",
  "31854": "Yes, and why did you go in?",
  "31855": "In which world?",
  "31856": "You have arms, I suppose?",
  "31857": "Where are you bound for?",
  "31858": "And of what kind of trees?",
  "31859": "Going to college, I suppose?",
  "31860": "What's gone of your father and your mother, eh?",
  "31861": "Do you suppose they'll ever dance together?",
  "31862": "Do they imagine at home that I am so inexpert in the theory of drama as not to know this?",

  "32248": "When do you say?",
  "32249": "Did you touch it?",
  "32250": "Will it ultimately reach the clear surface of my consciousness, this memory, this old, dead moment which the magnetism of an identical moment has travelled so far to importune, to disturb, to raise up out of the very depths of my being?",
  "32251": "Dandyism?",
  "32252": "What is a fray?",
  "32253": "Why is the crane so thin?",
  "32254": "Is it very important news?",
  "32255": "What on earth can she have gone there for?",
  "32256": "You'll do it, then?",
  "32257": "But what are these shocking screams?",
  "32258": "And the new system is one of your own invention?",

  "32260": "What does the king wish?",
  "32261": "What have they taken a baby in there for?",
  "32262": "My wife came to your house to reclaim her father?",
  "32263": "Why, how can you be dissatisfied with yourself if you are happy?",
  "32264": "But what do you mean by the highest of all knowledge?",
  "32265": "Do you remember what I saw?",
  "32266": "Why should I do that?",
  "32267": "Do you think you are fit to touch the bed of a man like me?",
  "32268": "No, but what is it, my dear?",
  "32269": "But when a man is drawn in two opposite directions, to and from the same object, this, as we affirm, necessarily implies two distinct principles in him?",
  "32270": "Was he not of noble birth?",

  "32285": "Whither should he go?",
  "32286": "Don't you need them?",
  "32287": "Or, what encouragement is there left to continue throwing good money after bad?",
  "32288": "Yes, how do you know it?",
  "32289": "May not this affectation of a false stoicism come from the same source as his recognition of the right of property?",

  "32291": "Said I not from the first it would be so?",
  "32292": "And who conceals them?",
  "32293": "Her lord it was whom I wounded mortally, and yet do I think I can be reconciled with her?",
  "32294": "Do you wish it known that you are interested about him, monsieur le comte?",
  "32295": "What qualities are there for which a man gets so speedy a return of applause, as those of bodily superiority, activity, and valour?",

  "32307": "Is he alive?",
  "32308": "And what was that, shipmates?",
  "32309": "Did the archdeacon wink, or did he not?",
  "32310": "Of what tongue, from what land were they?",

  "32319": "What does your brother say?",
  "32320": "What is this water, and where does it run?",
  "32321": "But, unscrew your navel, and what's the consequence?",
  "32322": "You often think you know me as I really am?",
  "32323": "But where am I wandering to?",
  "32324": "Was the other one lost by a whale?",
  "32325": "Why do you doubt your senses?",
  "32326": "One on each side of the ship?",
  "32327": "And is the record yours?",
  "32328": "Looks quite an affair, doesn't it?",
  "32329": "Where could they be?",
  "32330": "Ah, now, what do you take me for?",
  "32331": "Can not it?",
  "32332": "Are these to be or not to be the strains which the children will hear repeated in their ears by all the citizens about those who are intimated to them to be their parents and the rest of their kinsfolk?",
  "32333": "For a hunt and a gallop, eh?",
  "32334": "And why are you permitted to go at large, unwatched?",
  "32335": "Can't you let an old woman babble on paper once in a way?",
  "32336": "Anne, what want you here?",
  "32337": "Dravot used to make us laugh in the evenings when all the people was cooking their dinners—cooking their dinners, and … what did they do then?",
  "32338": "But what is he, I dinno?",
  "32339": "Is this quite certain?",
  "32340": "Where is he hiding?",
  "32341": "You dare to talk of your child?",
  "32342": "Can you not give me that information here?",
  "32343": "How say you, cousin?",
  "32344": "Can your horse do it, or can't he?",
  "32345": "But what is it now?",
  "32346": "Are you sure?",
  "32347": "Le mot d'ordre?",
  "32348": "We can't send for the whole medical faculty, can we, to treat your gout?",
  "32349": "Why, that way?",
  "32350": "Have you put the lunch in?",
  "32351": "How then had he been able to explain, and in such language, the number of things that he could not have said so well before?",
  "32352": "What, is it right?",
  "32353": "Well, and how do you do?",
  "32354": "And the king?",
  "32355": "Am I not already in the grave?",
  "32356": "Don't you see how the water boils and bubbles?",
  "32357": "What shall I say to him first?",
  "32358": "What promise?",
  "32359": "And will he talk thus of affairs in presence of two strangers?",
  "32360": "What would the issue of it be?",
  "32361": "And why?",
  "32362": "How long you been this way?",
  "32363": "But all this entails expense, and upon whom is this to fall?",
  "32364": "Is this the origin of the zodiacal light?",
  "32365": "With such alternatives, what would be the fate of the travelers?",
  "32366": "Is the fracture recent?",
  "32367": "Now are you ready to tell, boys?",
  "32368": "I suppose you have a garage there?",
  "32369": "That would meet the situation?",
  "32370": "Was this well done, young gentleman?",
  "32371": "You haven't heard about the school, I suppose?",
  "32372": "If he could see the projectile through the glass of his gigantic telescope, what would he think?",
  "32373": "Meaning what?",
  "32374": "What's the exact state of affairs as regards myself?",
  "32375": "Or you have overheard the servants talk?",
  "32376": "Tom, what's the matter with you?",
  "32377": "Who brought it into this room, then?",
  "32378": "But who do you suppose our other friend is?",
  "32379": "Why do you wish you were dead?",
  "32380": "Why, what do I keep you for?",
  "32381": "And JIM?",
  "32382": "But, pray, what pretty neat damsel was with you?",
  "32383": "Just like one of the peasants, all day long?",
  "32384": "Little boy, what do you want?",
  "32385": "Why shouldn't a woman?",
  "32386": "Where is there any water?",
  "32387": "How could I say such cruel things to her?",
  "32388": "I have caught you, have I?",
  "32389": "What are they talking about, and why doesn't he go back?",
  "32390": "Hadn't you better take up some line where they'll come in handy?",
  "32391": "Yes, that's it, she means to elope with him, but what am I to do?",
  "32392": "Leave tonight?",
  "32393": "What would you throw out?",
  "32394": "How would you like being kept awake for an hour in the middle of the night because her ladyship wouldn't go to sleep?",
  "32395": "What did the king say to you?",
  "32396": "Should I be getting your teas ready, while you do that?",
  "32397": "Do you know me?",
  "32398": "What vessel is that?",
  "32399": "Or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected?",
  "32400": "Shall we swear to each other, one day?",
  "32401": "Why are we there ?",
  "32402": "Not even me?",
  "32403": "Ah, ha, that's it, is it?",
  "32404": "There is a great improvement here, ma'am?",
  "32405": "Why does he want them?",
  "32406": "Broughton, just get a policeman, will you?",
  "32407": "Would he succeed in coming face to face with the girl he was seeking?",
  "32408": "Whatever do you mean?",
  "32409": "And what went wrong?",
  "32410": "Yes honey, but what's the matter with you, precious?",
  "32411": "Will not the capture of one army after another satisfy him, must all become prisoners?",
  "32412": "How will they get at it?",
  "32413": "Expenses paid, and a moderate screw?",
  "32414": "Was she expecting a visitor?",
  "32415": "Thinks I, what does it mean?",
  "32416": "Were's it gorn?",
  "32417": "How's that?",
  "32418": "Now you, sir, will you answer me or not?",
  "32419": "I take back the ring, after it has passed through the hands of that infamous creature?",
  "32420": "Why don't I what?",
  "32421": "And what did he find?",
  "32422": "Is it sure promised?",
  "32423": "What is the trial for, when he is not here and will never return?",
  "32424": "What a shameful disorder in nature, is it not, to make war against women?",
  "32425": "Whereabouts will she be?",
  "32426": "Am I not your comrade?",
  "32427": "But, suppose we should rise up tomorrow and emancipate, who would educate these millions, and teach them how to use their freedom?",
  "32428": "And he has gone, you say?",
  "32429": "Would you go and be dependent on your friends?",
  "32430": "H'm, then you DO give him money?",
  "32431": "Is she, then, preparing for a stroke?",
  "32432": "Where should good news come from to me?",
  "32433": "Well, and what woman don't I should like to know?",
  "32434": "It is midnight?",
  "32435": "Will you have them fetched back?",

  "32451": "Did I not give express orders that I would have no smoking in the office?",
  "32452": "Alive?",
  "32453": "And yet what necessity was there for his having a regular master?",
  "32454": "And who on earth, after the daily experience we have, can question the probability of a gentleman marrying anybody?",
  "32455": "How did you get it?",
  "32456": "Cried the other 'Why are you pelting me?",
  "32457": "How do they call you?",

  "32463": "To what end?",
  "32464": "Hadn't you young people better come in?",
  "32465": "A spy?",
  "32466": "And does the soul admit of death?",
  "32467": "Is it peculiar to you, or is it common to woman?",
  "32468": "And who is your father?",
  "32469": "And is he unhappy?",
  "32470": "What does this mean?",
  "32471": "When shall I be back?",

  "32477": "And how will you be able to avoid being ashamed, if you do not show equal courage with your commander, when he goes before you into danger?",
  "32478": "How many men?",
  "32479": "I have your permission to retire now, I suppose?",
  "32480": "Then why dontcha openum?",

  "32498": "And HE brought you the intelligence, did he?",
  "32499": "She no sooner observed my emotion than she changed colour, and asked what ailed me?",
  "32500": "Do you think then, sir, that these riches are lost because I gather them?",
  "32501": "How is that, la mere?",

  "32643": "What made him get up and run away when I came?",
  "32644": "And you didn't speak to her?",
  "32645": "Claim it?",
  "32646": "Would the mere fact of his having been admitted to the house be sufficient?",
  "32647": "Should he there encounter some unexpected knot in the darkness?",
  "32648": "Instead of getting a soft fence against the cold, shadowy, unapplausive audience of his life, had he only given it a more substantial presence?",
  "32649": "And what did you do with that letter?",
  "32650": "Don't you think it must be glad to be a rose?",
  "32651": "What stirs the bush?",
  "32652": "Why do you call it my allowance, and never let me spend it?",
  "32653": "What's more unanswerable than a fact?",
  "32654": "Did he subdue his prejudices, and those of his subjects?",
  "32655": "You are going that way?",
  "32656": "What I don't you know about it yet?",
  "32657": "Oh, my king, say yourself, did I not owe it to this poor girl to try everything in order to save her?",
  "32658": "What could I become with these surroundings?",
  "32659": "May I see?",
  "32660": "And why was that, do you suppose?",
  "32661": "Have you anything to ask this witness, boy?",
  "32662": "As the conviction of a notable criminal is at stake, would you be so kind as to send for all your servants?",
  "32663": "But he will take something?",
  "32664": "What must be your nature, that you should so betray his trust?",
  "32665": "But why does your aunt call you her uncle?",

  "32676": "What will become of her?",
  "32677": "But why this necessity ?",
  "32678": "You, sire?",
  "32679": "I am your wife, and why will you not listen?",
  "32680": "And how has it ended?",
  "32681": "Well, who done the shooting?",
  "32682": "He has, has he?",

  "32689": "But you, what will you do?",
  "32690": "What am I to say?",
  "32691": "What is that worth?",
  "32692": "Haidee?",
  "32693": "But must you go home yet?",
  "32694": "Was the island inhabited?",
  "32695": "We are sure of the father, but what have we for the son?",
  "32696": "Strange, eh?",
  "32697": "Or what avails a curse or blessing from a man like you?",
  "32698": "How shall we go?",
  "32699": "And what is he good for if he never helps anyone?",
  "32700": "Was it dreaded by him?",

  "32703": "Had it much in it?",
  "32704": "Ah, whither did my tender longing then flee?",
  "32705": "What go us all, to let her har such talk?",
  "32706": "I suppose the moon was terrible full when you were born?",
  "32707": "But where were my friends and relations?",
  "32708": "But what security would you give?",
  "32709": "He is a son of the old archdeacon, is he not?",
  "32710": "And you will devote yourself to that?",
  "32711": "If I don't work who's to keep the wife and the kids?",
  "32712": "Would any man, who is walking along, tread as willingly on another's gouty toes, whom he has no quarrel with, as on the hard flint and pavement?",
  "32713": "May not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by affording a wider scope for your revenge?",
  "32714": "Daughter, is this true, what he says?",
  "32715": "What can't?",
  "32716": "But do you think you have seen all of my tower and fair retreat?",
  "32717": "How did he manage the card trick?",
  "32718": "The rascal is rich, then?",
  "32719": "What can he hope to find there?",
  "32720": "You will not even help me?",
  "32721": "Isn't he like an angel?",
  "32722": "To whom?",
  "32723": "Have you seen him?",
  "32724": "Did he talk of a divorce?",
  "32725": "Railroads, his father, aind't it?",
  "32726": "You say he is dying?",
  "32727": "Would not my absence itself be an evidence to them of my alarm, and therefore of my fatal knowledge?",
  "32728": "Why, then, do you introduce scientific questions if you have never studied them?",
  "32729": "Can it be beyond me to control myself?",
  "32730": "How do I know what I did then?",
  "32731": "No chance of a war?",
  "32732": "Who will avenge it?",
  "32733": "Do you feel it?",
  "32734": "Already arisen?",
  "32735": "You demon, what are you doing here?",
  "32736": "You mean, I suppose, that society here is not as brilliant?",
  "32737": "Well, how old are you?",
  "32738": "This evening?",
  "32739": "Does a boy ever notice these things?",

  "32741": "And who else should?",
  "32742": "What was there in common between him and her?",
  "32743": "You are rich, then?",
  "32744": "Will you, gentleman?",
  "32745": "And certainly once a man begins to neglect his domestic duties he becomes painfully effeminate, does he not?",
  "32746": "Why did he not speak to her?",
  "32747": "But what are you doing here?",
  "32748": "What will you do after that?",
  "32749": "Why can you not go elsewhere?",
  "32750": "But no accident, I hope?",

  "32754": "Why, surely you never really wished to take ME into your family?",
  "32755": "Wouldn't this secure us from this storm?",
  "32756": "Shall I say you want us to go?",
  "32757": "Why invite witnesses when both of us would be walking in eternity in a couple of minutes?",
  "32758": "Then according to your argument it is just to injure those who do no wrong?",
  "32759": "Have you not your mother to share it with you?",
  "32760": "Why don't you help him?",
  "32761": "Of course the lady knows that, don't she?",
  "32762": "Can you be a coward?",
  "32763": "Who knows if we might not find on the opposite side one of the caverns which we have searched for in vain here?",
  "32764": "What have I done, that may deserve this?",

  "33043": "Only slightly touched?",
  "33044": ", and he ran away with her in the boat quite against her will, and what could she do?",
  "33045": "Was it for so petty a thing that he had done all that he had done?",
  "33046": "Perhaps this incident was connected with that of the bullet?",
  "33047": "Conway, what are you going to do?",
  "33048": "Are limes the fashion now?",
  "33049": "It ain't no fun, is it?",
  "33050": "Rebecca, may I give you a wing?",
  "33051": "What were the defects of this remarkable man?",
  "33052": "Won't you tell me a story, while we are resting?",
  "33053": "But how were we to get him into his clothes again?",
  "33054": "I hope I was not the trouble, guardian?",
  "33055": "Where is beauty?",
  "33056": "Where has he gone?",
  "33057": "Well, then, how if we were to begin with oysters, and so change the whole program?",
  "33058": "The face he pulled?",
  "33059": "Can they govern a family, or take care of the poor babes whom they bring into the world?",
  "33060": "Is it, then, stretching our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the occasion of the change?",
  "33061": "Neither gold nor rank?",
  "33062": "But was he alone or accompanied?",
  "33063": "WHY, you dear delightful woman, did you like it?",
  "33064": "Who is knocking?",
  "33065": "That was intended, I think, wasn't it?",
  "33066": "How can you speak of it in that way?",
  "33067": "Do you mean that we are going to die too?",
  "33068": "Why not stay here now and be quiet?",
  "33069": "You have since reflected?",
  "33070": "Do you think your hotel man will open his hotel this month?",
  "33071": "Helen, you wouldn't think I'd invent that?",
  "33072": "Is that all, gentlemen?",
  "33073": "Why should you be inconvenienced?",
  "33074": "Thed what are you?",
  "33075": "Did anyone ever hear the like?",
  "33076": "Is there too much vanity in what I have just said?",
  "33077": "What is that?",
  "33078": "You would not marry him, now that he is free?",
  "33079": "And the unjust is good and wise, and the just is neither?",
  "33080": "Who wrote it?",
  "33081": "Now, was that somebody brother to the prisoner at the bar?",
  "33082": "Well, does the colonel treat you well?",
  "33083": "How long are we to endure it?",
  "33084": "What is it that I manage?",
  "33085": "Quite so, but it seems rather an absurd blind, does it not?",
  "33086": "You made paper, pens and ink?",
  "33087": "But why talk now?",
  "33088": "Is he perchance thy son?",
  "33089": "Is it a renewal of the former proposition or what?",
  "33090": "But what to do?",
  "33091": "Shall we charge them or no?",
  "33092": "Why should I tire you with particulars of my consequence?",
  "33093": "Then why do you apply to me?",
  "33094": "If it were alive, wouldn't it trot, and prance, and eat oats?",

  "33099": "Our neighbor?",
  "33100": "Where would they meet?",
  "33101": "How was it I noticed nothing?",
  "33102": "Where are you going, bandit?",
  "33103": "You do not doubt his affection?",
  "33104": "What orders?",
  "33105": "Can you walk?",
  "33106": "If he had been positively in earnest, with downright manly earnestness, would he have allowed the thing to drag itself with a weak uncertain life, as it had done for the last two or three years?",
  "33107": "Even allowing that she does not love him, that she pays no heed to her vows and promises, how can she give herself to another man?",

  "33110": "What can be done for it?",
  "33111": "Is everything as it should be?",
  "33112": "I trust he does not suffer?",
  "33113": "How do you mean, the general?",
  "33114": "And how many hours a day did you do lessons?",
  "33115": "Is it a very wicked place?",
  "33116": "Why had our incomprehensible guide led us to the bottom of this submarine crypt?",
  "33117": "What are you doing tonight?",
  "33118": "Will you take me away with you?",
  "33119": "I hope we are not to part as enemies?",
  "33120": "Ah, dear sister, how can I answer this question?",
  "33121": "Why will you think so?",
  "33122": "What could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as it dropped on her work?",
  "33123": "Do you mean me, sir?",
  "33124": "Did he not pretend to go back to his tribe, who had treated him ill, and driven him from their wigwams like a dog?",
  "33125": "But how can we find the way in this fog?",
  "33126": "In a decadent society, to come nearer to the problems which concern us in ethics, must a man strive to realize the social will expressed in progressive decadence?",
  "33127": "Had he noticed that the days had been only six hours long, and that the weight of the atmosphere was so much diminished?",
  "33128": "What was the man doing when you saw him?",
  "33129": "What does all this knowing mean to me?",
  "33130": "Might not that person by patient waiting be covering silent preparation, and proving his fitness for the glorious task before him?",
  "33131": "But what if it's worse than this?",
  "33132": "Not HE?",
  "33133": "Do I try and catch them?",
  "33134": "Still inquisitive?",
  "33135": "Is it my fault if fortune, which has frowned on you, has been kind to me?",
  "33136": "You haf not got something to drink, hey?",
  "33137": "Yes, dear?",
  "33138": "Art shod with lead?",

  "33143": "In the meantime, who can foretell what would be the sufferings and privations of the people during its existence?",
  "33144": "What is it, grandmother?",
  "33145": "If we could get a drink?",
  "33146": "Is it not the duty of the nations to combine and to relieve suffering humanity?",
  "33147": "Then that is not the knowledge which we are seeking to discover?",
  "33148": "You met a monk, did you not?",
  "33149": "Can I not read your heart?",
  "33150": "You don't KNOW?",
  "33151": "What, it seems I do not drink but by an attorney?",
  "33152": "What was the cause of this flaw?",
  "33153": "Shall I give her?",
  "33154": "Was it right to be frightened already?",
  "33155": "Why can't they do as I have done, ma'am?",
  "33156": "At what hour would you wish the ceremony performed?",
  "33157": "Do you mean a compliment?",
  "33158": "Do you not know that there is a spirit within you different from flesh?",
  "33159": "In this painful moment can the best of fathers wish to destroy my domestic happiness, the only kind which now remains to me?",
  "33160": "What struggle was going on within him?",
  "33161": "So that he still expects his money?",
  "33162": "Why don't you open the door for papa?",
  "33163": "What will become of us if she dies, as I always fear when her face is like that?",
  "33164": "And if not, is he a devil?",
  "33165": "You your command, and I my title?",
  "33166": "Why has she not written to me, then?",
  "33167": "By this train?",
  "33168": "Are they good to eat?",
  "33169": "Will we trample again upon that torn and mangled corpse?",
  "33170": "And who can wonder if it be so, mother?",
  "33171": "Are you comfortable now, sir?",
  "33172": "Swear it was not true?",
  "33173": "What good was moral support in providing a million and a half?",
  "33174": "But can you restore him back to life?",
  "33175": "You won't consider me in your debt?",
  "33176": "I hope you're well?",
  "33177": "Did he designedly conceal some incident of his captivity?",
  "33178": "You remember that young fellow mother wanted me to have?",
  "33179": "So there are fashions, nowadays, in illness, are there?",
  "33180": "Then, sir, you are a favourite, I find, among the ladies?",
  "33181": "Do he rave about his mother just the same, poor fellow?",
  "33182": "Where is it?",
  "33183": "Yours then are rather here?",
  "33184": "Are you in a position to quit the post of superintendent at this moment?",
  "33185": "Do you observe anything remarkable about that?",
  "33186": "How was this to be done?",
  "33187": "Have you never heard talk of a certain secret?",
  "33188": "Did he come here voluntarily?",
  "33189": "Wouldn't you?",
  "33190": "What do you really think of her?",
  "33191": "When did he give it you?",
  "33192": "Unintentionally?",
  "33193": "Harry?",
  "33194": "Am I to come home?",
  "33195": "Now if this tenderness for the dead is such an exercise of these three theological virtues, and if, again, even heroic sanctity consists principally in their exercise, what store ought we not to set upon this touching and beautiful devotion?",
  "33196": "And the result of the examination?",
  "33197": "His ELDER brother?",
  "33198": "Perhaps he was expected to utter certain words?",
  "33199": "Supposing he is loyal, can any of his requests be granted, and if any, which of them?",
  "33200": "Are you sure you are more reasonable?",
  "33201": "He undergoes so much from such inquiries that when they are made by boys he revenges himself by flipping at their ears over the counter and asking the young dogs what they mean by it and why they can't speak out at once?",
  "33202": "Shall I go in first?",
  "33203": "What will you warm yourself with this winter?",

  "33212": "How think you of that?",
  "33213": "Does she?",
  "33214": "What is that water?",
  "33215": "Going on?",
  "33216": "What palace may it deck?",
  "33217": "Reversed?",
  "33218": "Are you going to sit down, or are you not?",
  "33219": "Oh, master, what are you saying?",
  "33220": "Don't you remember that THAT, originally, was what we were to get her for?",
  "33221": "Were you ever there?",
  "33222": "Ain't you going to do anything, sir?",
  "33223": "Do you see what a villain he is?",
  "33224": "Don't you think a good deal is done when you come out and talk to me this way?",
  "33225": "And yet, when I was at my father's, did not the men give up their gayest balls and parties in order to pass the evening with me?",
  "33226": "But I want to know why the word 'moor' should have been written?",
  "33227": "We sent you wine?",
  "33228": "When did you get the letter?",
  "33229": "What is indispensable to you?",
  "33230": "What have I said?",
  "33231": "But how could you be sure I would know it?",
  "33232": "Tell me, I entreat of you, who and what you are?",
  "33233": "Had he not seduced his sisters, one after the other?",
  "33234": "Might I speak to you with regard to that matter of his grace, sir?",
  "33235": "You mean to say our old raft warn't smashed all to flinders?",
  "33236": "Must I close this?",
  "33237": "The world is surely not worth living in now, is it?",
  "33238": "And was this the man?",
  "33239": "What's the time?",
  "33240": "What's queer?",
  "33241": "But was he a lawyer after all?",
  "33242": "What house will they take?",
  "33243": "May the man who denies it rest his assertion upon such general considerations as that satisfaction presupposes desire, and that desire implies a lack, and, hence, pain?",
  "33244": "Was it well?",
  "33245": "Could it be done?",
  "33246": "Why should I stand in a comrade's way?",
  "33247": "What have you done with that gentleman against whom you had the audacity, about twelve days ago, to make an accusation of passing false money?",
  "33248": "What else should I stay on for?",
  "33249": "What beings surround me?",
  "33250": "What judgment?",
  "33251": "How could I offend a man who was charitable enough to sit at my bedside a good hour, and talk on some other subject than pills and draughts, blisters and leeches?",
  "33252": "D'Epinay?",
  "33253": "Well, hain't he got a father?",
  "33254": "Are you certain of what you say, monsieur?",
  "33255": "And the reason is that each part of him is doing its own business, whether in ruling or being ruled?",
  "33256": "You want it, I expect?",
  "33257": "Had he been fooled once more?",
  "33258": "Do you seriously believe that that machine has travelled into time?",
  "33259": "What says our graver sister?",
  "33260": "But when these different reflections and observations concur in establishing the same conclusion, must they not bestow an undisputed evidence upon it?",
  "33261": "Can I do anything?",
  "33262": "Ain't you seen the rag this week?",
  "33263": "What passage is that?",
  "33264": "But does she now dissolve the union?",
  "33265": "Any way out of that yard, now?",
  "33266": "Waw shouldn't I git a bit o me own back?",
  "33267": "Have those who have had their share in oligarchies been peculiarly wise and peculiarly devoted to the common good?",
  "33268": "What was there to be done in the village?",
  "33269": "What should I tell?",
  "33270": "Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad?",
  "33271": "To what purpose?",
  "33272": "And if it is labor that creates wealth and legitimates property, how explain the consumption of the idler?",
  "33273": "What did you mean by that?",
  "33274": "Well, what do YOU make of it?",
  "33275": "Are there any?",
  "33276": "And if I refuse to retract, you wish to fight, do you?",
  "33277": "Dora, what has happened to you?",
  "33278": "Where have you been sleeping all this week?",
  "33279": "But what do you gather from it?",
  "33280": "Well, ain't you going to save any of it?",
  "33281": "Then how could you know?",
  "33282": "Are you much hurt?",
  "33283": "Daunted?",
  "33284": "And why should you try to deceive me by telling a tale?",
  "33285": "Can I come, with my doll?",
  "33286": "Are you sorry for hiring me, master?",
  "33287": "Yes my boy?",
  "33288": "Had it not been for this utter stranger, they had succeeded, for who would have accepted my unsupported word against the damning evidence of those cards hidden on my person?",
  "33289": "Why this man saved and that man lost?",
  "33290": "Aren't they beautiful?",
  "33291": "How has my judgment wander'd?",
  "33292": "And is not all true virtue the companion of wisdom, no matter what fears or pleasures or other similar goods or evils may or may not attend her?",
  "33293": "You know what I mean?",
  "33294": "What, sweetheart?",
  "33295": "What sort of a place is it?",
  "33296": "Well, I vow, that's what the sea folks call sailing UNDER BARE POLES, come true, aint it?",
  "33297": "Who took his hands out of mine?",
  "33298": "I insist upon your living, do you hear?",
  "33299": "Why on earth did you ask him to dine with us?",
  "33300": "A man's or a woman's?",
  "33301": "Was she sheering off?",
  "33302": "What say your old men?",
  "33303": "Monsieur d'Artagnan, will you do me a favor?",
  "33304": "Are not the quail, the pigeon and the partridge the natural prey of the hawk?",
  "33305": "From the country, I see, sir?",
  "33306": "Would prudence or gratitude allow the pontiffs to renounce their benefactor?",
  "33307": "Why must their ruffs be always crinkled like endive leaves, and not crimped with a crimping iron?",

  "33317": "You're not worried about anything?",
  "33318": "Are you sure you know the way?",
  "33319": "Why not make him a doctor like his father?",
  "33320": "But what was that to her, or to any one but myself?",
  "33321": "A little fancy work?",
  "33322": "Then again, if a woman and her lover conspire to murder a husband, are they going to advertise their guilt by ostentatiously removing his wedding ring after his death?",
  "33323": "Where are you off to?",
  "33324": "Yes, but if we can't help them?",
  "33325": "What's set you a snivelling now?",
  "33326": "And who is to do the parish work?",
  "33327": "Are you well fed?",
  "33328": "Well, why don't they support us?",
  "33329": "How many years do you mean to live after I am gone?",
  "33330": "What could these people do?",
  "33331": "Do you think I would leave you?",
  "33332": "And what do you call all this?",
  "33333": "Is it anything bad?",
  "33334": "Is it of course?",
  "33335": "But now what?",
  "33336": "Where is it?",
  "33337": "Would these two travellers make much difference to the horses, if we took them with us?",
  "33338": "Shall we not bear the trials of life a little longer in patience?",
  "33339": "How can they recognize you, if you act in such a manner that no one can recognize you?",
  "33340": "What is it you smell of?",
  "33341": "Forgotten, indeed?",
  "33342": "Were you at the performance last evening?",
  "33343": "How have you got on?",
  "33344": "Why had she allowed him to understand that he was master of her heart?",
  "33345": "Paying the money, I suppose?",
  "33346": "May one venture to ask you, monsieur, on what you have reflected?",
  "33347": "Are you, then, a coward?",
  "33348": "Would it not be safer and more certain if I should ask him his name and tell him yours?",
  "33349": "Why, how did he come here, mother?",
  "33350": "You'll get down, brother, won't you, and take something?",
  "33351": "Why do you say that, when you are going to this terrible war, and he is so old?",
  "33352": "Under what law, and for what offence?",
  "33353": "Easily?",
  "33354": "Why did he not take her in his arms and swear that he would never leave her?",
  "33355": "DID you hear that?",
  "33356": "Is the committee willing to hear this witness?",
  "33357": "Would you care for it?",

  "33363": "Married?",
  "33364": "Will that do now?",
  "33365": "How shall I put it on?",
  "33366": "And to what purpose?",
  "33367": "Mouston?",
  "33368": "How is your dear mother getting on?",
  "33369": "But you know how it all ended, don't you?",
  "33370": "Why did we choose it, this foolish task?",
  "33371": "Are you an alienist?",
  "33372": "Cannot ate it?",
  "33373": "You won't give it up?",
  "33374": "You are, I imagine, still of the same opinion?",
  "33375": "Or not you so much, perhaps, as your friend in the city?",

  "33377": "Is there no force on this side of the creek?",
  "33378": "If I guess rightly, will you confess it?",
  "33379": "Did you ever hear a definition of fame, sir?",
  "33380": "Ay, but how shall we know the catchpole?",

  "33383": "Why, according to popular belief is it rather characterised by the very contrary?",
  "33384": "Shall we hold it as a province and govern it by despotic power?",
  "33385": "My dear doctor, what is my wife's complaint?",
  "33386": "Do we go all the way today?",
  "33387": "Oh, what does that matter?",
  "33388": "What place was there in her mind for a remonstrance to lodge in?",
  "33389": "Really and truly?",
  "33390": "If that were so, what had become of my father?",
  "33391": "But where is the last year's snow?",
  "33392": "How much will you ask to stay with her till the end?",
  "33393": "Can the heart become misshapen and contract incurable deformities and infirmities under the oppression of a disproportionate unhappiness, as the vertebral column beneath too low a vault?",
  "33394": "What can it be?",
  "33395": "Of whom are you jealous, now?",
  "33396": "What was the sense of that?",
  "33397": "I felt very ignorant, but what could I do?",
  "33398": "And what are you going to do with yourself now, if I may ask?",
  "33399": "What interest of hers was affected by the treaty?",
  "33400": "An order to who?",
  "33401": "Which is the stronger, the small stick that first PRODUCES the fire, or the fire itself?",
  "33402": "So you've been at the club?",
  "33403": "Don't you really?",
  "33404": "Has he been a good soldier except the desertion?",
  "33405": "Do you think not?",
  "33406": "O, it an't?",
  "33407": "What you mought call me?",
  "33408": "Full of hope?",
  "33409": "And who will go?",
  "33410": "What is the news, whence is thy embassage?",
  "33411": "Farther?",
  "33412": "Should he slip away after having come and peeped into the barricade?",
  "33413": "Perhaps?",
  "33414": "Very well, my dear sir, and how does that concern us?",
  "33415": "But will the wild ass submit to the bonds?",
  "33416": "Where is the count?",
  "33417": "A whole one, and in a candlestick?",
  "33418": "Are you?",
  "33419": "Are you going to remain as you are, dear princess?",
  "33420": "What might have been your opinion of the place?",

  "33431": "You are angry, monsieur?",
  "33432": "What, he told you so, I suppose?",
  "33433": "What, have they buried him in honour for his services to them?",
  "33434": "To stand from fear set free?",
  "33435": "You are aware, I suppose, that all mythology and poetry is a narration of events, either past, present, or to come?",
  "33436": "Why do you go, sir?",
  "33437": "You called my father 'Michael' as if you knew him well?",
  "33438": "This DETOUR has been entirely for our benefit, then?",
  "33439": "What do you tell me?",
  "33440": "What was she like now?",
  "33441": "Call the captain, and heave the ship aback?",
  "33442": "And did you observe any change in her then?",
  "33443": "Flee alone, and leave you here?",
  "33444": "Can I have lost it?",
  "33445": "Are the sacrifices I have made of honour and modesty to you no proof of my being tied to you in bonds too strong to be broken?",
  "33446": "But what makes you so much out of sorts?",
  "33447": "Why, wherefore stay you?",
  "33448": "Who asked him while I was away?",

  "33455": "But, on the other hand, did not the people evince decided obstinacy and insubordination?",
  "33456": "And my making it easy for you to see the child?",
  "33457": "Has anyone an interest in preventing your arrival there?",
  "33458": "Do you abuse your teacher?",
  "33459": "Has it struck you that we may not now choose to give over?",
  "33460": "And how do you like the place?",

  "33492": "Now, sir, what have you to say to me?",
  "33493": "I suppose we're going to have a talk about this?",
  "33494": "Let 'em both wait?",
  "33495": "Perhaps you would not mind walking to town with me?",
  "33496": "Love had bandaged his eyes, in order to lead him whither?",
  "33497": "It is not my intention to detain the reader by expa?",
  "33498": "Why ask?",
  "33499": "Am I to read this?",
  "33500": "Who are you then?",
  "33501": "Was there nothing to fear?",
  "33502": "But did this man hope to conceal himself effectually behind that heap of rubbish, which one need but skirt?",
  "33503": "Then it all depends on that object that you regard, for your reasons, as evidence?",
  "33504": "What if there was no rank of life in which she could now properly attach herself?",
  "33505": "Why then do philosophers look for public spirit?",

  "33507": "But do you know this mysterious count is a bachelor?",
  "33508": "Why strive for a coherent, satisfied life?",
  "33509": "You won't throw any more stones, will you?",

  "33513": "Who knew what would have saved him?",
  "33514": "Could he not annul the verdict?",
  "33515": "How can something come out of nothing?",
  "33516": "And now, he said, what did we just now call that principle which repels the even?",
  "33517": "What is that error?",
  "33518": "I hurriedly made him a reply to the effect, that I hoped the error into which I had been betrayed by the desperate nature of my love, did not induce him to think me mercenary too?",
  "33519": "What is this place?",
  "33520": "Guy, is this amount of confidence to be our stock to start the new life on?",
  "33521": "How is your head, better?",
  "33522": "What matters that?",
  "33523": "The opportunity is a good one, then?",
  "33524": "But if, in spite of all my precautions, I am at last obliged to fight, will you not be my second?",
  "33525": "May I ask you to be so kind as to inquire of all your subjects if any of them have seen a fishing hook lost in the sea?",
  "33526": "And what is your business?",
  "33527": "Had I better wait till it's three o'clock?",
  "33528": "Remember me, don't you?",
  "33529": "Aren't there really?",
  "33530": "Why are you not eating anything, gentlemen?",
  "33531": "But opals are unlucky, aren't they?",
  "33532": "Does this not amount to your stealing the annual salary from your lord?",
  "33533": "Who'd you reckon?",
  "33534": "WILL IT BE COMMUNISM?",
  "33535": "Are you a married man, sir?",
  "33536": "What dream we of?",
  "33537": "What's the good of taking it in hand now?",
  "33538": "But if he does not come?",
  "33539": "Have you any idea what became of them?",
  "33540": "Are you the little girl that comes out with the lady an' four horses?",
  "33541": "And why this ABSOLUTISM in the relations of capitalist and laborer?",
  "33542": "Is any man termed a gentleman, that is not always in the fashion?",
  "33543": "Do I ever leave you?",
  "33544": "Are you all of the same opinion?",
  "33545": "Whose was this mighty personality?",
  "33546": "Perhaps you could name the figures of a few wiolincellers of a good tone?",
  "33547": "Why don't you take it?",
  "33548": "To marrying whom?",
  "33549": "Am I wrong to come up here to see her?",
  "33550": "You heard my question?",
  "33551": "Why now should I be tempted?",
  "33552": "I'm afraid I've given you a good deal of trouble, haven't I?",

  "33557": "Kennedy was preparing to discharge all his batteries into the middle of the ascending multitude, but what could he have done against such a numberless army?",
  "33558": "Was it not rather a service and a kindly act?",
  "33559": "Won't that do as well?",
  "33560": "Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?",
  "33561": "How could there be when it's barely ten o'clock yet?",
  "33562": "And have you got a paper?",
  "33563": "Where is the girl who promised to marry any one who would release her brother?",
  "33564": "And all arithmetic and calculation have to do with number?",
  "33565": "How do you happen to be here?",
  "33566": "And what is the result?",
  "33567": "Don't you see that all this leads to comfort in the end?",
  "33568": "And for what have you ruined your life, if you come to think of it?",
  "33569": "Who talks of cadeaux?",
  "33570": "But did you not read that I must be alone?",
  "33571": "Do you find the prisoner guilty or not guilty?",
  "33572": "And he who does not possess and is therefore unable to impart this conception, in whatever degree he fails, may in that degree also be said to fail in intelligence?",
  "33573": "But what's happened to you?",
  "33574": "Are you lost or have the wolves eaten you?",
  "33575": "Yet why do tears blind my eyes?",
  "33576": "Why should I still be subject to these visitations of the devil, when I try so hard to keep him away?",

  "33582": "What has anybody to do with that?",
  "33583": "Was I wrong in claiming that confusion reigned among legists, and ought I to be legally prosecuted for having said that their science henceforth stood convicted of falsehood, its glory eclipsed?",
  "33584": "John, which way must we now turn?",
  "33585": "Was I not right?",
  "33586": "Why so breathless a start?",
  "33587": "And have we, at our age, been earnestly discoursing with one another all our life long only to discover that we are no better than children?",
  "33588": "Do you want to go with us?",
  "33589": "Who had taken the letters, if letters there were?",
  "33590": "At any rate, they are all reconciled to it now, I hope?",
  "33591": "And they will place them under the command of experienced veterans who will be their leaders and teachers?",
  "33592": "Even the spiritual vision, is it not at all points arrested by the continuous golden walls of the universe?",
  "33593": "What can you be dreaming of?",
  "33594": "You say again you are quite sure that it was the prisoner?",
  "33595": "Is it any new trouble?",
  "33596": "And talking about the hospital?",
  "33597": "Amid what elegancies of carved furniture, decorated walls, elaborate tapestries did they move?",
  "33598": "If they are really qualified for the task, will not their own hearts be the first to inform them of it?",
  "33599": "What sort of life were that to live?",
  "33600": "What's your trade?",
  "33601": "How could I have been so beguiled?",
  "33602": "How does I talk wild?",
  "33603": "Would we be done for?",
  "33604": "Come, now, my learned friend, what makes you hesitate?",
  "33605": "Why can't you wait?",
  "33606": "You have come far?",
  "33607": "But is she not awfully rich?",
  "33608": "Who can make good coffee?",
  "33609": "So we had better leave you?",
  "33610": "Is the downstairs door fast?",
  "33611": "Or if he is to be governed, how can he be governed well?",
  "33612": "Will you have tea here then, or go across to the house, where there's a tent on the lawn?",
  "33613": "Did you observe the colour?",
  "33614": "Nothing that can't be got over, perhaps, after all?",
  "33615": "Can it be?",
  "33616": "Will this assist in explaining the difficulty?",

  "33623": "When is your turn to come?",
  "33624": "Had I thus come in vain into these forests and mountains?",
  "33625": "Do you call that nothing?",
  "33626": "What is it, then, which does judge about them?",
  "33627": "Shall I lend you a hand here?",
  "33628": "Damn you, what do you mean by that?",
  "33629": "And who's that tall chap standing beside her?",
  "33630": "Would any one deny this?",
  "33631": "And you didn't give him the oysters?",
  "33632": "Did they impose on each industry a proportional tax, so as to preserve a balance in the market?",
  "33633": "What should you do in my place?",
  "33634": "What more could one ask for?",
  "33635": "For who can change men's opinions?",
  "33636": "Would a painter be any the worse because, after having delineated with consummate art an ideal of a perfectly beautiful man, he was unable to show that any such man could ever have existed?",

  "33639": "Were those great, stony cliffs the gates of paradise?",
  "33640": "Shall our rivers and harbors be improved?",
  "33641": "But how do you make it shine through the walls?",
  "33642": "What, do you want to leave us?",
  "33643": "Do you stand me out, mistress?",
  "33644": "How is the poor woman?",
  "33645": "Or, that she should prefer the rant of flattery to the simple accents of sincerity?",
  "33646": "Are you a gentleman?",
  "33647": "How do yer see that?",
  "33648": "Did you speak?",
  "33649": "Shall I see you again before your departure?",
  "33650": "And how are the other people getting on?",
  "33651": "Whah did ye cum from?",
  "33652": "Why should I not go?",
  "33653": "And if they are not fortifying, sire?",
  "33654": "But hark, what music is that?",
  "33655": "What do you suppose they would do to a man disarmed like me?",
  "33656": "Are you really frightened, madame?",
  "33657": "What are you doing, you stupid creature?",
  "33658": "Who will undertake it, if it be not also a service of honour?",
  "33659": "What have you heard?",
  "33660": "But as for me, what solace had I when the days of my fighting were done?",
  "33661": "You were not unfortunate, and yet you are an orphan, fatherless and motherless?",
  "33662": "Would not that have been better evidence?",
  "33663": "Where was my head when I made that grant?",
  "33664": "Wherein, then, lay the resemblance that made the young man's heart beat with a kind of retrospective excitement?",
  "33665": "How will she take it?",
  "33666": "And you order me to announce you to the duchess?",
  "33667": "What more has happened?",
  "33668": "Why did you not tell me, instead of teasing me like this?",
  "33669": "Judah told you?",
  "33670": "So far we are within the bounds of possibility, are we not?",
  "33671": "Will the train soon be in?",
  "33672": "What is your opinion?",
  "33673": "How was it, having so little in reality to conceal, that I always DID feel as if this man were finding me out?",
  "33674": "But isn't there another thing to be done?",
  "33675": "What I wanted, who can say?",
  "33676": "Do you suppose I don't think about that myself?",
  "33677": "Where is thy victory?",
  "33678": "Oh come, now, you don't mean to let on that you LIKE it?",
  "33679": "And pray how do I and these my friends around me seem to you?",
  "33680": "Ah, are you composing poetry, queen?",
  "33681": "What is the use of being exquisite if you are not seen by the best judges?",
  "33682": "Then what was the use of our coming?",
  "33683": "Why do you disappoint me so?",
  "33684": "Are you a child or a teetotum?",
  "33685": "Take head?",
  "33686": "The date?",
  "33687": "Then, when your articled time is over, you'll be a regular lawyer, I suppose?",
  "33688": "Would I do him this favour?",
  "33689": "Do you mind if I go in and tell this man to come on to us when he's finished here?",
  "33690": "Is it in this particular part, or in that other?",
  "33691": "Haven't I seen you blowing as hot as you please?",
  "33692": "Are you ready to get back the trade on those terms?",
  "33693": "To what does your ambition aspire?",
  "33694": "And all complaining, accusing?",
  "33695": "Is she like me?",
  "33696": "What, none of you?",
  "33697": "I am not blushing, for I don't think I need blush about it, need I?",
  "33698": "You will fulfill your promise to me?",
  "33699": "What sort of animal is this interest?",
  "33700": "You must have known that?",
  "33701": "Was it not I?",
  "33702": "And am I dishonest?",
  "33703": "What's the letter?",
  "33704": "Would it please you to accompany her upon the lake?",
  "33705": "Ladies and gentlemen, what is your opinion on the subject?",
  "33706": "What do you want, sir?",
  "33707": "And where can a man seek ends of any sort beyond this broad field?",
  "33708": "How came you to make such a mistake as this?",
  "33709": "Is it too late?",
  "33710": "How do you feel now?",
  "33711": "Anne, did YOU put sugar in these peas?",
  "33712": "That is to say, justice is useful when money is useless?",
  "33713": "Is not this second infinite, so to speak, subjacent to the first?",
  "33714": "And he said nothing as he died?",
  "33715": "WHO forbade you?",
  "33716": "Gallia out of place?",
  "33717": "And am I not ready to do so again?",
  "33718": "Frightened of what?",
  "33719": "Where do we go first?",
  "33720": "Where are you?",
  "33721": "How did you get yourself into this mess?",
  "33722": "It is not in your possession?",
  "33723": "Will your excellency give your name, or remain incognito?",
  "33724": "If I kept that little girl in my mind for five years, didn't I earn some part in her?",

  "33726": "Have you any sort of conveyance?",
  "33727": "I suppose you kissed his hand?",
  "33728": "What's in it?",
  "33729": "How dare you look into this garden?",
  "33730": "How find a straight road of progress, you men of science, of industry, of cooperation, of trades unions, and all the rest?",
  "33731": "Really?",
  "33732": "Is this gentle and lovely being lost forever?",
  "33733": "Wouldn't you?",
  "33734": "Weigh out tragedy, like butcher's meat?",
  "33735": "Happy?",
  "33736": "What mingles in the strain?",
  "33737": "What can that be, monsieur le chevalier?",
  "33738": "Why do you seek me?",
  "33739": "What, to buy gingerbread?",
  "33740": "Have the fugitives been pursued?",
  "33741": "Is he likely to marry, uncle?",
  "33742": "Not even a sou?",
  "33743": "What did he want?",
  "33744": "Of course it is very different here, but who knows how long it will last?",
  "33745": "Do you ever try to read your own face?",
  "33746": "No accident has happened to him?",
  "33747": "Yea, truly, saw ye not birdlime upon his hands?",
  "33748": "What have you to do with us?",
  "33749": "What's his name?",
  "33750": "Why, then, I would ask, do we see these lengthened shadows, which follow in the course of our political day?",
  "33751": "And how are they all?",
  "33752": "Larrey?",
  "33753": "Is this his house?",

  "33757": "Why, do you smoke?",
  "33758": "Will you have it now?",
  "33759": "When shall we get away?",
  "33760": "Good gracious, what's that?",
  "33761": "Have you been there?",
  "33762": "Didn't I tell you to put up a fence?",

  "33806": "Shall we return to the camp?",
  "33807": "Query, ought it not, in strict grammar, to be injecerit, instead of infecit?",
  "33808": "Then you are giving it up?",
  "33809": "And do ye carry your flock bed, and your quilt, and your crock, and your bit of chiney?",
  "33810": "Is there anything else that puzzles you?",
  "33811": "Would you leave our village, desert our homes and fly before an enemy approaches?",
  "33812": "What are you to her?",

  "33814": "What could your ladyship propose by it?",
  "33815": "Who, then, has more luck than I have?",
  "33816": "When did they cease to be so?",
  "33817": "And what did you detect, if not gratitude?",
  "33818": "Speak I soothly, men of greenwood?",
  "33819": "Could misunderstanding be more complete, or sympathy worse misplaced?",
  "33820": "And do you mean to tell me that I should have been the same man if I had not from a boy associated that old tower with all ideas of what its owners were, and should be, as knights and gentlemen?",

  "33833": "Is it the last occupant's furniture?",
  "33834": "But if I were to die, what would you do then?",
  "33835": "That being so, what did it mean?",
  "33836": "Could I believe my eyes?",
  "33837": "Why didn't you do it?",
  "33838": "You mean all's lost?",
  "33839": "Is what true, madame?",
  "33840": "And pray why?",
  "33841": "Do you know for certain that he was at home last night?",
  "33842": "And who'll manage the matron?",

  "33863": "You can hear them, can't you?",
  "33864": "Has the girl said anything to you to make you feel thus?",
  "33865": "Do you recollect him?",
  "33866": "If so, what are the key enabling technologies?",
  "33867": "Why isn't she dull and ashamed?",
  "33868": "Is this to insult me?",
  "33869": "What side of oneself does one display in evasions?",
  "33870": "And was it a fine baby?",
  "33871": "What are you stopping here for?",
  "33872": "Can you guess why I did that?",
  "33873": "Or what great danger dwells upon my suit?",
  "33874": "My genus, is that you?",
  "33875": "Would you so fain have her as you pretend?",
  "33876": "What is the good of the ear if it tells you the same as the eye?",
  "33877": "Perhaps you do not wish to accept my proposition?",
  "33878": "And you repent already?",
  "33879": "An answer?",

  "33883": "Vat I mean?",
  "33884": "Would you like to see the pawnbroker himself?",
  "33885": "Could he, too, write like that, express the melancholy of his soul in verse?",
  "33886": "So the question was, what to do?",
  "33887": "Well enough to question him in that language?",
  "33888": "But what's the meaning of it all?",
  "33889": "Then do you know what I did?",
  "33890": "Might I crave your favour to carry my name to him, and say I beg to say a word in his ear?",
  "33891": "Ah kin you tell wether I've a soul or not?",
  "33892": "What money?",
  "33893": "Is your tobacco perfumed, servant, that you swear by the sweet smoke?",
  "33894": "Could any thing worse be said of property?",

  "33901": "Who nails up the coffin?",
  "33902": "Would he, too, weep for him?",
  "33903": "Next?",
  "33904": "You have heard of my dear father, then?",
  "33905": "What does he want?",
  "33906": "Or does it take a woman's heart to understand a woman's letter?",
  "33907": "Why, is there no cause?",
  "33908": "Shall I assist you in repairing your negligence?",
  "33909": "Oh, don't you know it?",
  "33910": "What's it all about?",

  "33913": "What has your life been, so far?",
  "33914": "Are you strong enough to face it alone?",
  "33915": "HOW WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT A SUPERFICIES TERMINATES IN A POINT?",
  "33916": "Do you talk of a sacrifice?",
  "33917": "Then he sent them a herald asking if they wished to be cut to pieces for the sake of those who had betrayed them, or save their lives and keep their reputation for gallantry?",
  "33918": "But what was the reason of this indignation?",

  "33945": "Then why don't you say so, and let the girl put away the things, instead of keeping her waiting all morning?",
  "33946": "And then?",
  "33947": "Do you care for him?",
  "33948": "Do you think that I would tell you a falsehood about it?",
  "33949": "Will that do, or is it too genteel?",
  "33950": "Is there no devil to help me?",
  "33951": "You think it's possible?",

  "34128": "And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't see you?",
  "34129": "Lieutenant?",
  "34130": "A sailor, I believe?",
  "34131": "What was the difference between that gallant that's gone and you, sir?",

  "34199": "Never more to be separated?",
  "34200": "What disguise do you propose to adopt?",
  "34201": "How was that managed?",
  "34202": "Is it not so, my friends?",
  "34203": "And he has accepted the call?",
  "34204": "How long have you been cooling your eye there?",
  "34205": "What name go you by?",
  "34206": "And what truth?",
  "34207": "Yes, where is this letter?",
  "34208": "Where away, cook?",
  "34209": "And with regard to the past?",
  "34210": "A deanery for her brother in the church?",
  "34211": "What shall we have, said he, to drink in these deserts?",
  "34212": "Is there any collective action which cannot find its justification in political unity, in patriotism, in the balance of power, or in civilization?",
  "34213": "Lady, when was it that your heart was there?",
  "34214": "Where is humanity?",
  "34215": "Where did he live, then?",
  "34216": "What have I done?",

  "34219": "Pray what is your own theory as to what took place?",
  "34220": "What?",
  "34221": "She would smile on me, she would say a word to me, would that do any harm to any one?",
  "34222": "How are you, dear child?",
  "34223": "What origin do they attribute to these rifts?",
  "34224": "Do you think I am not grateful?",
  "34225": "WHAT did you see her doing?",
  "34226": "Under these circumstances, was it perfectly certain that no danger could accrue?",
  "34227": "Why should society work out an extraordinary system of rewards for those whom it is already rewarding automatically?",
  "34228": "Don't you think that is an admirable sentiment?",
  "34229": "If, secondly, the question is asked whether this being is substance, whether it is of the greatest reality, whether it is necessary, and so forth?",
  "34230": "How could I wait so long?",
  "34231": "Well, have I convinced you?",
  "34232": "Wasn't I right in counting on you?",
  "34233": "Oh, where am I to go?",
  "34234": "You will not let me speak?",

  "34243": "Will their successors falter and plead organic impotency in the nation?",
  "34244": "Now what do you think?",
  "34245": "It is in my power, think you, to make such a change at demand?",

  "34254": "To lead me to my death, is that enough?",
  "34255": "What use am I to make of your instruction?",
  "34256": "Do you think I don't know what's good for you?",
  "34257": "If your crop comes shorter into market than any of theirs, you won't lose your bet, I suppose?",
  "34258": "Where?",

  "34262": "Oh?",
  "34263": "Is it deemed a holy place in the land, then?",
  "34264": "The king has not signed, however?",
  "34265": "Why the delay of a reargument?",
  "34266": "But how do you know?",
  "34267": "Should I ever meet you there?",
  "34268": "But if he did marry her in spite of the threat?",
  "34269": "That's a very old tree over there, isn't it?",
  "34270": "Did I say a peach?",
  "34271": "What has happened since then to give you a completely new idea of the case?",
  "34272": "Has a young man, such as I am, gone through this morning, then?",
  "34273": "Hold on, hold on, won't ye?",
  "34274": "What am I to say, indoors?",
  "34275": "Do I see anything in the way I'm made, which calls upon me to be a snivelling, solemn, whispering chap, sneaking about as if I couldn't help it, and expressing myself in a most unpleasant snuffle?",
  "34276": "How did he evolve his ethics?",
  "34277": "Have you seen the thief?",
  "34278": "Do virtuous men, in so far as they are virtuous, stand in each other's light?",
  "34279": "Shall we bathe this morning?",
  "34280": "What's the matter now, ma'am?",
  "34281": "And is no allowance to be made for inadvertence, or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment?",
  "34282": "Or is it actual?",
  "34283": "You'll call when you're ready for your pudding, won't you?",
  "34284": "How does she look?",
  "34285": "Married another?",
  "34286": "Do with him?",
  "34287": "And what may his name be, coptain?",
  "34288": "You might have stayed away, I suppose, if you would?",
  "34289": "Brown, convicted of mutinous conduct and sentenced to death?",
  "34290": "Who will become the sharer of this dangerous secret?",
  "34291": "What is the gift of conquest but safety?",
  "34292": "French, eh?",
  "34293": "Is he too so very remarkable?",
  "34294": "Who do you think is going to be married tomorrow?",
  "34295": "Both, on the other hand, had joined pretty gaily in the conversation, for why should they interrupt it?",
  "34296": "I regulate my watch?",
  "34297": "Do you hear, sir?",
  "34298": "How can girls like to have lovers and refuse them?",
  "34299": "Have you finished tea?",
  "34300": "How he out fins and flops about, and blows like a porpoise properly frightened, don't he?",
  "34301": "What like was she?",
  "34302": "Has anything extraordinary happened to you?",
  "34303": "Who made this gruel here?",
  "34304": "And where are they?",
  "34305": "If you had been born such, would you have been here now?",
  "34306": "But how do you come here?",
  "34307": "But I wonder is it so very nice?",
  "34308": "Did it hurt you much?",
  "34309": "Well, well, he made a mistake, didn't he?",
  "34310": "On what principle, then, shall we any longer choose justice rather than the worst injustice?",
  "34311": "Do you reckon YOU can learn 'em anything?",
  "34312": "What do I read here?",
  "34313": "What woman can before her husband?",
  "34314": "Who has the right to dictate to my conscience, and where did he get that right?",
  "34315": "Is she coming, and open, free?",
  "34316": "By your orders?",
  "34317": "To dig the foundations out from under that cabin with?",
  "34318": "Why, you wouldn't break both their hearts now?",
  "34319": "My dear child, how can I help minding?",
  "34320": "Is this so?",
  "34321": "You'll make up for it by making another?",
  "34322": "Bubbles?",
  "34323": "Are you willing to endure to the last, and not once attempt a repayment?",
  "34324": "What are they, my dear friend?",
  "34325": "What d' you want o' him again?",
  "34326": "I hope you think so?",
  "34327": "But why on earth should it bother him?",
  "34328": "I wonder whether I've done well in advising that amusement?",
  "34329": "Had I?",
  "34330": "Jack?",
  "34331": "What means can I take to introduce it to the world?",
  "34332": "And so it came about that the young rat did see a good deal of the world, but how?",
  "34333": "But they will contest the will after your death?",
  "34334": "Walks by night, does she?",
  "34335": "But there CAN be something else, can't there?",
  "34336": "And who is it to belong to?",
  "34337": "Is that enough?",
  "34338": "What about souls?",
  "34339": "But what have you been doing?",
  "34340": "Do we need common sense and fairness in our regulations?",
  "34341": "Oh, who does not desire to dwell forever and forever in that city of love and light when the pains and sorrows, the trials and tears, of this weary life are over?",
  "34342": "Have you let your lodgings, ma'am?",
  "34343": "Ought we to rank this one species with bears, and what should we do with the other species?",
  "34344": "Were you not engaged in it then?",
  "34345": "How do you know that, sir?",
  "34346": "Fond mother, whence these fears?",
  "34347": "Is it conscious?",
  "34348": "What do you know on the subject?",
  "34349": "And what, pray, is your idea of the duties of a devoted friend?",
  "34350": "Who can desire it more than I?",
  "34351": "What would you propose doing?",
  "34352": "What chance have I?",
  "34353": "What were his charms?",
  "34354": "Why should they not work for a uniform minimum of labour conditions through all their communities?",
  "34355": "So he has turned you out?",
  "34356": "Come for long?",
  "34357": "By the way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from?",
  "34358": "Why should he be so mean now?",
  "34359": "After all, I don't funk it, do I?",
  "34360": "Hadn't we better stroll into the park?",
  "34361": "Did ye not care for her?",
  "34362": "DO with it?",
  "34363": "Ask you what provocation I have had?",
  "34364": "Not know the thing which my own eyes beheld?",
  "34365": "Anything else?",
  "34366": "Will you taste for yourself?",
  "34367": "It's not a very nice night to be out, is it?",
  "34368": "You'll come and meet me as usual, girls?",
  "34369": "Now, had I come upon a hopeless incompatibility?",
  "34370": "Do you know what you're doing?",
  "34371": "Quite a vineyard, hey?",
  "34372": "Do I flatter myself if I allow myself to look at it in that way?",
  "34373": "Have I done right?",
  "34374": "He's all right?",
  "34375": "How can I ever thank you for all the deep obligations you impose upon me every day?",
  "34376": "Ought we not to make something great out of a youth, under twenty, who has, in the highest degree, quickness to conceive and courage to execute?",
  "34377": "Was there no loophole of escape?",
  "34378": "I suppose we must take the shapes of beasts?",
  "34379": "What are you surprised at?",
  "34380": "What did they matter when he played divinely?",
  "34381": "Tell me the why of this?",
  "34382": "But is it that makes you go?",
  "34383": "Will you graciously let me kiss your hand?",
  "34384": "Who are you to ask me my business?",
  "34385": "But does not this question make a disturbance outside of political circles?",
  "34386": "What influence can I possibly have over a bandit?",
  "34387": "Why don't you make him speak?",
  "34388": "Is there a carriage at the door?",
  "34389": "Do you still wish to do so?",
  "34390": "At all events, what use was there in delaying?",
  "34391": "And what right had she to be cross?",
  "34392": "What's the good, if you're sick with love for him?",
  "34393": "How should you?",
  "34394": "Is that fine, keen edge upon your soul that gives such avidity for holy things?",
  "34395": "What of the resemblance?",
  "34396": "Why a locksmiths' association in a village?",
  "34397": "Or must I fly the country altogether?",
  "34398": "You play cards, don't you?",
  "34399": "What would have been the result?",
  "34400": "Back at last?",
  "34401": "What else could this fragment be but the sole surviving remnant of some sumptuous mansion that once had stood on this unrivaled site?",
  "34402": "Isn't it possible to help them?",
  "34403": "In relation to what objects?",
  "34404": "You WERE afraid?",
  "34405": "Do you think I am deceiving you?",
  "34406": "How can you know what he is?",
  "34407": "What were you eating there all by yourself for your dinner?",
  "34408": "What'll yer give me?",
  "34409": "Are you going to sail in?",
  "34410": "Wonder if you'll ever drag me up there?",
  "34411": "Is there any need to hurry, sir?",
  "34412": "Still I ask you, what is this to me?",
  "34413": "And leave the litter as it is?",
  "34414": "Do you advance with him?",
  "34415": "So perhaps I shall rub on?",
  "34416": "In front or behind?",
  "34417": "And by what authority?",
  "34418": "Yea, what then?",
  "34419": "I really could not say?",
  "34420": "And does he imagine that the coadjutor will put himself out for him?",
  "34421": "Do you think she will ever forget that her son is her safeguard, her shield, the pledge for her dignity, for her fortune and her life?",
  "34422": "You said prince, did you not?",
  "34423": "Are you sure they won't come and search the garret?",
  "34424": "Was it worth it?",
  "34425": "What young ladies?",
  "34426": "Shall we turn back?",
  "34427": "At the end of your name stands for?",
  "34428": "Is it not time to decide finally the meaning of the gift of the great fortune now all in your hand, and growing?",
  "34429": "Well, are we going to stand here all day?",
  "34430": "Who would not acknowledge that a poor man or woman, fain to earn daily bread by the sweat of the brow, is far more reprehensible in yielding to the solicitations of love, than a rich lady, whose life is lapped in ease and unrestricted luxury?",
  "34431": "Have we reached the limits of what reason can supply?",
  "34432": "What should I say?",
  "34433": "Did you ever, O king, hear a cat purring over a bowl of broth, or the buzzing of beetles in the twilight, or a shrill tongued old woman scolding your head off?",
  "34434": "What will gladden your heart?",
  "34435": "Are you sure it will be the last time?",
  "34436": "She'll do, won't she?",
  "34437": "What is that for a man to do?",
  "34438": "Since when?",
  "34439": "Why, soldiers, why?",
  "34440": "How came you to read some of those queerer ones?",
  "34441": "Did you not love your husband either?",
  "34442": "Where is true peace or true glory?",
  "34443": "How is it now?",
  "34444": "Durys?",
  "34445": "Don't you want to stop any longer?",
  "34446": "Has the reality of them ever been perceived by you through the bodily organs?",
  "34447": "Or are you going to build up a wall some way between your country and ours, by which that movable property of yours can't come over here any more, to the danger of your losing it?",
  "34448": "Which girls should love?",
  "34449": "When was it?",
  "34450": "Does it belong to anybody in the neighbourhood?",
  "34451": "Has anything happened?",
  "34452": "Did you hit her?",
  "34453": "Is there any signal for the general rally?",
  "34454": "About what age is he?",
  "34455": "And why did I come here?",
  "34456": "What mercy can you expect from the man whom you have wronged?",
  "34457": "Have I taken an oath of some sort, then?",
  "34458": "Shall we say, in such a case, that the will of the majority was for the ultimate end?",
  "34459": "Where what?",
  "34460": "You say?",
  "34461": "Do you no longer like to think of your mother?",
  "34462": "What are you doing?",
  "34463": "May I understand, sir, that you threat is withdrawn, and that my income is secure?",
  "34464": "Are the two so deeply separated in this town, that there is no place whatever for an honest workman between them?",
  "34465": "Why then should a man cling to a longer stay here?",
  "34466": "The symptoms are marked, do you see?",
  "34467": "Whether fate, whose circle surrounds us, exercises a control over our liberty so imperious and compulsory that infractions of the law, committed under the dominion of antinomies, cease to be imputable to us?",
  "34468": "But supposing we had the authority, I would ask what good can result from the examination?",
  "34469": "What am I coming for?",
  "34470": "But settled?",
  "34471": "Did I like his voice?",
  "34472": "How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor?",
  "34473": "Who to?",
  "34474": "And the girl?",
  "34475": "Well, have you had a good hunt, have you botanised successfully?",
  "34476": "And why should you want to spite her?",
  "34477": "What did you pick me up for?",
  "34478": "And what does 'in my name' mean?",
  "34479": "What, are you all got together, like players at the end of the last act?",
  "34480": "Have you ever seen it?",
  "34481": "Isn't it the truth?",
  "34482": "When, then, did father and son exchange shields, and why?",
  "34483": "Would he have been justified in sacrificing his own child, even if he could thereby save another's?",
  "34484": "Why are you only laying one place?",
  "34485": "Loves him?",
  "34486": "Yet who are the folk whom you find HERE?",
  "34487": "Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?",
  "34488": "Who is coming in here?",
  "34489": "What was she going to say, and what reply would she get?",
  "34490": "Can you tell me how to go about getting on the stage?",
  "34491": "What was your idea, then?",
  "34492": "Running from what?",
  "34493": "Valdemar?",
  "34494": "How are you going to manage to get out?",
  "34495": "Have you a portmanteau?",
  "34496": "What does it matter?",
  "34497": "What depth have we now reached?",
  "34498": "Wouldn't you have been rude?",
  "34499": "What the deuse do we men go to school for?",
  "34500": "If it be called swamp or sky?",
  "34501": "Defend ourselves against D'Artagnan?",
  "34502": "How the devil is he so like?",
  "34503": "Once more, will you undertake it?",
  "34504": "Are not these functions proper to the soul, and can they rightly be assigned to any other?",
  "34505": "Was it sheer blind force of passion that would satisfy her now?",
  "34506": "How's this, dear niece?",
  "34507": "Do you know who that was?",
  "34508": "Was SHE at the ball too?",
  "34509": "And what made you ask it of me?",
  "34510": "Do you know that if we should ship, it would serve you quite right?",
  "34511": "Where are your wits?",
  "34512": "Is it possible, dear, that what I hear is true?",
  "34513": "No clue?",
  "34514": "Will you give me as far from the river as you can distinguish the belly of a horse?",
  "34515": "So what if he died, how did this concern the boy?",
  "34516": "Build I in the winds my dwelling?",
  "34517": "And what more free than he that desireth nothing upon earth?",
  "34518": "And you have them?",
  "34519": "But don't you love me, my dear wife, because I have been so pulled down by illness?",
  "34520": "I don't know if you notice it?",
  "34521": "Did I indeed, sir?",
  "34522": "And are greater miracles to be performed by those who do not follow his footsteps, who healed the body to reach the mind?",
  "34523": "And did I say there was any difficulty?",
  "34524": "Have I not got a brave determination of all my doubts, and a response in all things agreeable to the oracle that gave it?",
  "34525": "Could I leave the lady alone?",
  "34526": "Is it really?",
  "34527": "Don't you think I've been extraordinarily good?",
  "34528": "Do you think I'm not sufficiently ruining my health living here amid the continual emanations of the pharmacy?",
  "34529": "What be ye looking at?",
  "34530": "How should she be able to compose herself when she should first see him?",
  "34531": "But tell me, what would you have done?",
  "34532": "Confused?",
  "34533": "Wherefrom do they acquire these tendencies, these peculiarities?",
  "34534": "Who first seduced them to that foul revolt?",
  "34535": "If they want to jump down, now, and get into trouble, who objects?",
  "34536": "Do you regard that meaning as offensive?",
  "34537": "And why does the former operation end exactly when the latter commences?",
  "34538": "What is your notion?",
  "34539": "What now was my plain duty?",
  "34540": "But where can one jump to?",
  "34541": "Isn't he idle?",
  "34542": "And how were they?",
  "34543": "Who told you his name?",
  "34544": "Who and where is he?",
  "34545": "Shall we then raise cuckolds?",
  "34546": "Guess I did, didn't I?",
  "34547": "But that I make no admissions?",
  "34548": "Am I deceived?",
  "34549": "What's the good of daylight now?",
  "34550": "Does any man ask himself what profit he has gained from the fulfilment of his dreams, if he must still endure, still undergo hunger and thirst and toil and trouble and care?",
  "34551": "What are the facts?",
  "34552": "Have you nothing to say to us?",
  "34553": "Can you tell when there is a good fire?",
  "34554": "What on earth will she say to me, I wonder?",
  "34555": "Where are thy sisters?",
  "34556": "Did you anticipate the accident which has happened to your granddaughter?",
  "34557": "What cause had you to make discoveries of his pretended passion?",
  "34558": "Elopement?",
  "34559": "How shall I be able to endure life for thirteen years?",
  "34560": "How deeply sir, you apprehend it?",
  "34561": "Cake or bread and butter?",
  "34562": "Or might you have only travelled for your amusement?",
  "34563": "Who has not seen poor birds caught by their feet in the lime?",
  "34564": "I have seen you before, I think?",
  "34565": "Does not the practice of despoiling an enemy afford an excuse for not facing the battle?",
  "34566": "The place is then, as you know, determined on rebellion?",
  "34567": "And was that the upshot of my life's hardest battle?",
  "34568": "When did you shed tears over lost souls?",
  "34569": "And the chief officer?",
  "34570": "Is it not horrible?",
  "34571": "On plantation?",
  "34572": "When you say it that way it sounds comical, does it not?",
  "34573": "What did you do with the girl?",

  "35738": "Are you really not to be persuaded, even now, to pass the night under my roof?",
  "35739": "What for, then?",
  "35740": "Is my husband's political career likely to suffer through this incident?",
  "35741": "Besides, where were these poor girls to go?",
  "35742": "Do you really think so?",
  "35743": "Say, that fits like a T, don't it?",
  "35744": "About what am I now employing my own soul?",
  "35745": "Do you speak by way of offence, sir?",
  "35746": "Why did you name them all with the same name?",
  "35747": "Well, I ask, what can the intervention of power, with the assistance of civil law and political economy, accomplish here?",
  "35748": "A bottle, perhaps?",
  "35749": "What do you expect to do in the midst of this darkness?",
  "35750": "You wouldn't mind that?",
  "35751": "And did she not even go to him?",
  "35752": "What other forces were arrayed?",
  "35753": "And why do they worry me so?",
  "35754": "Young men are all very well in their place, but it doesn't do to drag them into everything, does it?",
  "35755": "What becomes, then, of the doctrine of expiation and abstinence, the morality of sacrifice, resignation, and happy moderation?",
  "35756": "Can smiles make a man a better master or a better citizen?",
  "35757": "If she makes up her mind to tell you, you will come and let me know, will you not?",
  "35758": "What is this rubbish?",
  "35759": "Don't you know?",
  "35760": "What is he doing there?",
  "35761": "Suicide?",
  "35762": "Her name and family?",
  "35763": "What knave is this?",
  "35764": "But what did I know?",
  "35765": "Had he reached the point of forgetting the mayor's presence?",
  "35766": "Three?",
  "35767": "How could she do it, how can it be possible that she is a woman like that?",
  "35768": "Can we find any such connection in the case of a public work executed by a government?",
  "35769": "What sort of an entertainment, captain?",
  "35770": "How did he make it enter in?",
  "35771": "Whence, comrade?",
  "35772": "What do you reckon did it, boys?",
  "35773": "How do you help it?",
  "35774": "Is it not truly to clothe the naked, to procure for them a garment of light, a raiment of glory?",
  "35775": "Just give me one of those roses in the bunch you are wearing, will you?",
  "35776": "Didn't I tell you last night that if we could find where they were going by bribing a servant through my fellow, and then established ourselves close by with the mother, these people's honour would be our own?",
  "35777": "Harrison?",
  "35778": "Unless indeed you know me, and have some purpose in your brain?",
  "35779": "Is he conscious?",
  "35780": "Had his forms of expression changed, or his sentiments become less laudable?",
  "35781": "But what is it you wish?",
  "35782": "Why notice it?",
  "35783": "Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?",
  "35784": "On what charge?",
  "35785": "Is he not a handsome lad?",
  "35786": "Haue you hope of life?",
  "35787": "What is the remedy?",
  "35788": "You think so, do you?",
  "35789": "What would he himself say a couple of years after the event?",
  "35790": "How are you to act?",
  "35791": "Is it long since you came?",
  "35792": "By you?",
  "35793": "And will you let me play a few of your accompaniments?",
  "35794": "Sell my rapier?",
  "35795": "Is he prosperous and happy?",
  "35796": "Why will not people lend their money?",
  "35797": "Guess what?",
  "35798": "For sheer terror?",
  "35799": "Did you know this?",
  "35800": "What did I tell you about making me creak the door?",
  "35801": "And in what consists this plot?",
  "35802": "Whether those pleading orators were persons educated in the general knowledge of equity, or only in provincial, national, and other local customs?",
  "35803": "Shall I fetch you another cup?",
  "35804": "How's that for high living?",
  "35805": "Then for what reason did he call me son?",
  "35806": "And why do you keep following me about?",
  "35807": "Is it worth while to keep an army to protect you in writing proclamations, or to get once a year into winter quarters?",
  "35808": "Well, what's to be done?",
  "35809": "You mean you'll join us?",
  "35810": "Why don't you tell me what's the matter with you?",
  "35811": "Have you given this man work before?",
  "35812": "In the way, you mean, of living with US?",
  "35813": "Is he from home?",
  "35814": "Is there a house in the neighborhood?",
  "35815": "What were you doing on that armchair?",
  "35816": "What say my other friends?",
  "35817": "Some one?",
  "35818": "Do you then suspect any one?",
  "35819": "But why should you have been anxious?",
  "35820": "What size do you want to be?",
  "35821": "Now, is there any sense in these things?",
  "35822": "What manner of man is he?",
  "35823": "Don't you think it's rather a good idea?",
  "35824": "I might let that to you, for what matters it to me?",
  "35825": "What was the opinion?",
  "35826": "Whence comes this to pass, my masters?",
  "35827": "Nothing to you?",
  "35828": "Won't you be mine?",
  "35829": "I suppose you have had dinner?",
  "35830": "Where in the word did you acquire such a voluminous vocabulary?",
  "35831": "And what if other benefits were gained by peace?",
  "35832": "What is it, father?",
  "35833": "That wasn't wrong, was it?",
  "35834": "What did you tell him?",
  "35835": "From the cardinal?",
  "35836": "Is it far from here, sir?",
  "35837": "Do you mean to say you don't know where?",
  "35838": "When was he married?",
  "35839": "Don't you dread the attitude that insensibly arises out of legal obligation?",
  "35840": "And you don't want to go again to night?",
  "35841": "Was she beautiful?",
  "35842": "You're staying the night, I hope?",
  "35843": "What would I want wedding so young?",
  "35844": "What IOU's?",
  "35845": "Do you know anything?",
  "35846": "If this sad picture you have drawn, be indeed true to nature, how does your country, said I, appear so attractive, as to draw to it so large a portion of our population?",
  "35847": "That's interesting, eh?",
  "35848": "Isn't he charming?",
  "35849": "Whither so soon?",
  "35850": "Hain't you never seen him?",
  "35851": "Did you find no trace of him?",
  "35852": "The sovereigns?",
  "35853": "A physician?",
  "35854": "Where ought I be, then?",
  "35855": "Who said that she was to belong to you?",
  "35856": "Wouldn't you go a day's journey, if you were in my place?",
  "35857": "In this place?",
  "35858": "I said 'people,' didn't I?",
  "35859": "You mean it is a little dry, perhaps?",
  "35860": "You are not touched even by that danger?",
  "35861": "Then this racket they are making is on account of it, I suppose?",
  "35862": "For what is he in prison then?",
  "35863": "Would exasperation, however, if relief had longer been postponed, finally have betrayed me?",
  "35864": "What did I mean by asking questions?",
  "35865": "Will you dance with me?",
  "35866": "Can you dive?",
  "35867": "More rabbits?",
  "35868": "For this?",
  "35869": "Was there any connection between the commotion of the atmosphere and that of the interior of the earth?",
  "35870": "Has your master come?",
  "35871": "A merry going forth bringeth often a sorrowful return, and a merry evening maketh a sad morning?",
  "35872": "And even of what he knew, how much could he make his untravelled friend either apprehend or believe?",
  "35873": "When did you enter the room?",
  "35874": "Whom have I to live for?",
  "35875": "And how about the savages?",
  "35876": "Going to lose her?",
  "35877": "And may we be so bold as to affirm that there are also many criminals to be found in them, rogues who have stings, and whom the authorities are careful to restrain by force?",
  "35878": "For such matters?",
  "35879": "And do you object to going through the village?",
  "35880": "What do you think of that figure there?",
  "35881": "To how many people can any one tell all?",
  "35882": "Could a body hypocritically take there a small hypocritical touch?",
  "35883": "How have they made me a victim?",
  "35884": "But where can he be?",
  "35885": "How am I?",
  "35886": "And what did she say?",
  "35887": "What could he have done to me?",
  "35888": "Do you take us for thieves?",
  "35889": "For a young cobra?",
  "35890": "And how did you like the master?",
  "35891": "He won't have it?",
  "35892": "Theramenes?",
  "35893": "France?",
  "35894": "Tell me, my dear sir, do you admit the existence of volcanoes on the moon's surface?",
  "35895": "Was it not necessary for the good of the state and the interests of the young king, that you should live in good intelligence with the queen?",
  "35896": "What could be the meaning of his sudden change toward me?",
  "35897": "He warned you to abandon your visit?",
  "35898": "Did you really come to propose to me?",
  "35899": "And then, you ungrateful being, you are not pleased to see an old friend?",
  "35900": "Will you return to this gang of robbers, and to this man, when a word can save you?",
  "35901": "Because of the money?",
  "35902": "Who could place my feet on the right path, and bring me back to my company?",
  "35903": "Why did you pull the curtain over the place to make me think you were still there?",
  "35904": "And are the hours the same?",
  "35905": "What is the reason?",
  "35906": "Money is no object?",
  "35907": "Where, then, could the driver be, unless he were inside the house?",
  "35908": "Nay, has not a little rationality exposed many women to the severest censure?",
  "35909": "Was that all right?",
  "35910": "What is it?",
  "35911": "Why is the ardour of youth thus to be damped, and the luxuriancy of fancy cut to the quick?",
  "35912": "If there be no distinction between the pleasing and the disgusting, why does it accept the one or reject the other?",
  "35913": "How is that?",
  "35914": "What consolation does the poor suffering soul find in the superb coffin, in the splendid funeral?",
  "35915": "And what am I myself?",
  "35916": "Egeria?",
  "35917": "Have you dined?",
  "35918": "You are very lonely, are you not?",
  "35919": "Do you try to force them?",
  "35920": "What do you all say to a wrestling match?",
  "35921": "It was very game of her, wasn't it?",
  "35922": "What will the servants think?",
  "35923": "Would it still kick and show temper, then?",
  "35924": "Does he wish us to draw conclusions?",
  "35925": "Now, what is the harvest fortnight to be?",
  "35926": "Notwithstanding your father's wishes to the contrary?",
  "35927": "How many other families have never had that same opportunity?",
  "35928": "Ye higher men, what think ye?",
  "35929": "Are there many of them?",
  "35930": "I am now among princes like myself, am I not?",
  "35931": "What do you mean by tetragones?",
  "35932": "And you have been in the choir in pursuance of your duties?",
  "35933": "If all is well, why go to the lodge?",
  "35934": "None?",
  "35935": "In displaying anxiety for the breath of which he was at present so willing to get rid, might I not lay myself open to the exactions of his avarice?",
  "35936": "By what path did you get thither?",
  "35937": "Can we get behind his track so that they may smell it?",
  "35938": "You have how many new suits?",
  "35939": "How far mus go up, massa?",
  "35940": "Where's that?",
  "35941": "Is she discouraged, does she drag herself about the house and find fault with everything?",
  "35942": "What whole thing?",
  "35943": "Since it was your intention to live alone, why did you throw into the sea the document which put us on your track?",
  "35944": "If this were human life, if these were human beings, living in a complete world, then what was her own world, outside?",
  "35945": "We are at peace and, why then, should they harm us?",
  "35946": "Then you believe the papers?",
  "35947": "What must I do, officer?",
  "35948": "What do you like to talk about?",
  "35949": "Getting a bit hot, eh?",
  "35950": "If she had wished it, would she not have sent to me by this time?",
  "35951": "Or whom oppose?",
  "35952": "Was it, when he set his heart upon it?",
  "35953": "You, who refuse to tell me the slightest thing?",
  "35954": "Where's mama?",
  "35955": "Are we in any great danger?",
  "35956": "Or will a reaction set in which may arrest progress and even undo much that has been done?",
  "35957": "You are only responsible for my body, is it not so?",
  "35958": "But for this imaginary resistance, officially announced, how would it have been possible to justify the spoliations and exactions which ensued?",
  "35959": "How can you deliberately get up such paltry falsehoods?",
  "35960": "Afterwards to me?",
  "35961": "Carries a bag?",
  "35962": "Shall you not all help me?",
  "35963": "What signified the terms to them, so long as we obtained the actual surrender of people who only wanted a good opportunity to give up gracefully?",
  "35964": "Shall I cut it out?",
  "35965": "Is it possible you don't understand that yet?",
  "35966": "Would not the doing of this be your best mode of counteracting his raid on your communications?",
  "35967": "After dinner, eh?",
  "35968": "Well, what, my dear girl?",
  "35969": "What would they say if I did not go?",
  "35970": "But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?",
  "35971": "But to what in the world?",
  "35972": "By your leave, do you know me, sir?",
  "35973": "He will be ruined, you mean?",
  "35974": "What of the prisoner?",
  "35975": "Do you not see that by its solidification, it would burst through this field of ice that imprisons us, as, when it freezes, it bursts the hardest stones?",
  "35976": "Then it appears there will be an opposition, and the enterprise will be disputed?",
  "35977": "Have you heard?",
  "35978": "Will you dine with me?",
  "35979": "Does he ever come back to this neighborhood?",
  "35980": "Is true, as they tell me, that I can't even go away?",
  "35981": "And, if ignorance of everything which it is needful a ruler should know is likely to do so much harm in the governing classes of the future, why is it, they ask reasonably enough, that such ignorance in the governing classes of the past has not been viewed with equal horror?",
  "35982": "But when she comes back, I see now that she'll be rich as old master always said she would, and being a rich young lady, what could she want of me?",
  "35983": "And now, tell me your name?",
  "35984": "Do you fear their finding it here, should they come to search?",
  "35985": "If they don't look foolish its a pity?",
  "35986": "Whither are they going?",
  "35987": "Is this the gentleman's little purse?",
  "35988": "What is it, now?",
  "35989": "Was it a thicket?",
  "35990": "Was this the beginning of a happy change?",
  "35991": "Sir, may I have a few words with you concerning some business I have just decided upon?",
  "35992": "But where are you really going?",
  "35993": "What am dat?",
  "35994": "I hope there is no reason to distrust his fidelity?",
  "35995": "Of twelve rowers?",
  "35996": "How can one talk or think of such trifles?",
  "35997": "But what are we to do now?",
  "35998": "How does it happen that the presence of a woman overwhelms us so?",
  "35999": "Which do you know?",
  "36000": "You ask me what I will do?",
  "36001": "Then, surely, you will not object to lend it to us?",
  "36002": "What of him?",
  "36003": "Wot is this here business?",
  "36004": "And do you know what has become of him?",
  "36005": "Can you tell me, please, who is his favourite actor?",
  "36006": "What more could I hope to do by prolonging the interview?",
  "36007": "Pierced?",
  "36008": "What do you expect to get?",
  "36009": "Besides, was he not in the secret?",
  "36010": "Was it of any use to explain?",
  "36011": "How's the rheumatics?",
  "36012": "But where can one go?",
  "36013": "Where am I?",
  "36014": "Was it after all true that she had been conducting herself in a way that justified the world in thinking that she liked the man?",
  "36015": "Gold, ain't it?",
  "36016": "And, pray, who are you yourself?",
  "36017": "Is it possible for such a reason?",
  "36018": "Oh, how could we, on your money?",
  "36019": "Why should I give you courage?",
  "36020": "And how much have you got?",
  "36021": "How are you, young man?",
  "36022": "Chillip?",
  "36023": "I say, why are you so late?",
  "36024": "Will the job suit you?",
  "36025": "And who charges me with this, monseigneur?",
  "36026": "Shall I go on?",
  "36027": "Whence, now, bear ye burnished shields, harness gray and helmets grim, spears in multitude?",
  "36028": "To what do they seem to you to be like?",
  "36029": "And how stands the total?",
  "36030": "And did they not leave him on the south side of the river, with their prisoners, while they have gone foolishly on the north?",
  "36031": "Or spiders?",
  "36032": "But you receive him at your house?",
  "36033": "Was there a human agency in the matter?",
  "36034": "And what is the coachman like?",
  "36035": "Have we beheld demons?",
  "36036": "What is his religious doctrine to me, if he carries some good notions along with it?",
  "36037": "And when will that be, father?",
  "36038": "Who could have told her?",
  "36039": "That's it?",
  "36040": "How can I describe my sensations on beholding it?",
  "36041": "What can it be that has this double power?",
  "36042": "And yet you have sent for me?",
  "36043": "Why does a chicken cross the road?",
  "36044": "Who's got the job?",
  "36045": "Is she pretty?",
  "36046": "If ever you can get aboard again, says you?",
  "36047": "I don't know how I can ever make it up to you?",
  "36048": "Shall I fire my rifle off and scare him?",
  "36049": "Have you ever told a lie?",
  "36050": "If he forces us to it, they'll be producible, won't they?",
  "36051": "You have seen it on dozens of girls, and you never found out that it was pretty till now?",
  "36052": "What, the whole property there?",
  "36053": "But don't you know it is extremely wicked to do such things?",
  "36054": "Is it so important to you?",
  "36055": "What fiend possesses you to stare back at me, continually, with those infernal eyes?",
  "36056": "Even in the country do we get any rest?",
  "36057": "What is it, my friend?",
  "36058": "Why calls my friend?",
  "36059": "Were you examined at an inquest?",
  "36060": "How do they love it dressed?",
  "36061": "How can they get loose when there's a guard over them, ready to shoot them down if they move a peg?",
  "36062": "When were thy frequent pledges and still more frequent gifts believed or accepted?",
  "36063": "Your husband, then, is at last dead?",
  "36064": "Pillage?",
  "36065": "Is everyone all right?",
  "36066": "What do you say of this?",
  "36067": "And you don't know when he'll go away?",
  "36068": "Which do YOU think it was?",
  "36069": "Why is that gendarme there?",
  "36070": "Is it because I am not clean, and my clothes are all in rags, and because I am obliged to go begging about after the manner of tramps and beggars generally?",
  "36071": "Wouldn't that console you?",
  "36072": "But what are these beasts?",
  "36073": "You think your sister will come?",
  "36074": "You see him?",
  "36075": "Against the westland clans?",
  "36076": "But you won't tell him?",
  "36077": "And when will you come to see mamma?",
  "36078": "He did not happen to see our plan of fortifications, did he?",
  "36079": "You are not going out, I hope?",
  "36080": "If a man with a broad basis of popular support like that was proposing to entertain a duke, surely there could be no doubt about his motives?",
  "36081": "Was he blind?",
  "36082": "Does your majesty grant me this?",
  "36083": "Where was the horse?",
  "36084": "You won't stop for dinner?",
  "36085": "Well, you'll want to make up your mind pretty soon, won't you, if we're going?",
  "36086": "When is it going to be?",
  "36087": "Do you still feel any desire to stand up in his defence?",
  "36088": "Do you know who made you?",
  "36089": "What sort of a watchman, of a checker, are you?",
  "36090": "I hoped it was true?",
  "36091": "After?",
  "36092": "Why will you not grant my last wish?",
  "36093": "Do you pay taxes to an agent that he may destroy your property?",
  "36094": "He would have to fly, and where?",
  "36095": "In a figurative sense, how far, and to what offences, may it be extended?",
  "36096": "And what do you think of him?",
  "36097": "The register of my child's birth?",
  "36098": "Was there one exception, and that one he who needed to have been most happy?",
  "36099": "Who is this maid?",
  "36100": "But what was she to do?",
  "36101": "The peasants are ruined?",
  "36102": "Who but a billionaire could say what was fair exchange for a billion?",
  "36103": "Two pounds, and you bring it back?",
  "36104": "What natural force could have produced such plants, and what must have been the appearance of the earth in the first ages of its formation, when, under the action of heat and moisture, the vegetable kingdom alone was developing on its surface?",
  "36105": "Don't he?",
  "36106": "You love me just a little, then, marquise?",
  "36107": "Why are you virtuous?",
  "36108": "Are you far gone with a fool?",
  "36109": "Don't you remember how you used to say that we must always tell the truth?",
  "36110": "Us, won't they?",
  "36111": "How can a man conceal his character?",
  "36112": "What should I do?",
  "36113": "Is that all?",
  "36114": "Who, sire?",

  "36965": "And you did not know any one else on the train?",
  "36966": "You, a man already endowed with a man's discretion?",
  "36967": "You intend to remain?",
  "36968": "No guarantee?",
  "36969": "Are you asking for a lodger?",
  "36970": "And if it knew, would it dare?",

  "36982": "But what do YOU think?",
  "36983": "If he had not lost his balance, why should he have launched into an almost passionate defence of the physical coward?",
  "36984": "And is it not very rational to conclude, that the women who have not been taught to respect the human nature of their own sex, in these particulars, will not long respect the mere difference of sex, in their husbands?",
  "36985": "What is the object of these questions?",
  "36986": "Oh you're there, are you?",

  "37276": "What should I speak?",
  "37277": "How am I to know?",
  "37278": "Well, and what then?",
  "37279": "But who is she?",
  "37280": "What is that, madame?",
  "37281": "And when is he to be married?",
  "37282": "Doesn't look much like a man who sees spirits, does he?",
  "37283": "And what are the other teachers called?",
  "37284": "You have had nothing to eat, my pet?",
  "37285": "When do you expect to be here?",
  "37286": "One asked him if he was going to be married?",
  "37287": "What light is that on the hill?",
  "37288": "But where is the girl who owns the throne, and what is her name?",
  "37289": "What have I been cruel to you in?",
  "37290": "What does the hedgehog mean?",
  "37291": "Would your ransom be large enough to cover the cost of a broken church window?",
  "37292": "Is not that wrong?",

  "37294": "How if she will not come?",
  "37295": "What's that you're reading?",
  "37296": "Why have you set upon me in the dark?",
  "37297": "That is your father, is it not?",
  "37298": "What is the voice of history?",
  "37299": "Wouldn't you just love to be rich, girls?",
  "37300": "You are setting off, then?",
  "37301": "And he really succeeded?",
  "37302": "You have not heard then of what they are accused?",
  "37303": "You have a chart, haven't you?",
  "37304": "Why should he come again?",
  "37305": "What sort of a figure would he make if he escaped?",
  "37306": "Can it be possible?",
  "37307": "You don't mean to tell me you don't care about spiders?",
  "37308": "How you gwyne to git 'm?",
  "37309": "How you must have hated me after THAT evening?",
  "37310": "You wouldn't put yourself in opposition to the interests of your husband and child, would you?",
  "37311": "Mary, to me?",
  "37312": "And YOUR cheese, your excellency?",
  "37313": "And yet you saw how she thanked me, with her so beautiful dying eyes, her voice, too, so weak, and she kiss my rough old hand and bless me?",
  "37314": "In what respects?",
  "37315": "Had I caught her off her guard?",

  "37333": "Which did she choose?",
  "37334": "May I ask what position she holds in your household?",
  "37335": "What right have we to say that this is the people's will?",
  "37336": "If he was his confederate, why should he carry his photograph?",
  "37337": "Are beauties there as proud as here they be?",
  "37338": "Why, when the body is putrefying?",
  "37339": "And if not, what else did she imagine?",
  "37340": "Were you not, gentlemen, both in the musketeers of the late king?",
  "37341": "How long his he been there?",
  "37342": "What is this oven for?",
  "37343": "Nay, will not such a one often rejoice more than any other in the rich show of outer apparel?",
  "37344": "What does that nonsense mean?",
  "37345": "Would the selfish and the cowardly ever lack reasons for yielding to the enemy?",
  "37346": "Is he at home now?",
  "37347": "Do you see any inconvenience in having an army at the end of a year, instead of two regiments?",
  "37348": "Forgiveness?",
  "37349": "Well, in what case is it just that the tax should take the form of a levy on polls?",
  "37350": "Are they dead or alive?",
  "37351": "Do you know anything of it, fellow?",
  "37352": "What preservation can you now desire after the destruction of your temple?",
  "37353": "I'm busy, can't ye see?",
  "37354": "And what she said to you?",
  "37355": "Did you want a coffin, sir?",
  "37356": "Did you ever suppose you'd see the day when you'd be adopting an orphan girl?",
  "37357": "I wonder if this can be the person we're looking for?",
  "37358": "First, then, they resemble one another in the value which they set upon wealth?",
  "37359": "What did he repeat to us all the day?",
  "37360": "What are you saying to her?",
  "37361": "You're dancing, are you?",
  "37362": "Hate you, sir?",
  "37363": "Would you know him again?",
  "37364": "If I consent to announce you, may I at least know whom to announce, monsieur?",
  "37365": "What's wrong with my face?",
  "37366": "Had that begun in your time?",
  "37367": "Never been there?",
  "37368": "Is he not in love?",
  "37369": "What did she answer?",
  "37370": "Do you dare to say that I am not right?",
  "37371": "You don't know that?",
  "37372": "What are the facts?",
  "37373": "Somebody has called?",
  "37374": "What use will peace be when he is no longer here?",
  "37375": "Unable to grasp any thing great, is it surprising that they find the reading of history a very dry task, and disquisitions addressed to the understanding, intolerably tedious, and almost unintelligible?",
  "37376": "The inhabitants of the island and the sailors?",
  "37377": "You've got a mark upon you somewheres or another, I suppose?",
  "37378": "Where are all the listeners and spies who accompany the queen?",
  "37379": "What is this gnawing of conscience I am feeling now?",
  "37380": "What, are they gone, sirs?",
  "37381": "Whom the deuce can it be from?",
  "37382": "You didn't see her in there, did you?",
  "37383": "Need there now be any secrets between us?",
  "37384": "Was not he sent for?",
  "37385": "When was it received?",
  "37386": "But why on earth should you be pursued with such animosity?",
  "37387": "Didn't he tell you?",
  "37388": "Further, there can be no doubt that a work is spoilt when not done at the right time?",
  "37389": "What is it in your hand?",
  "37390": "What arrangement, squire?",
  "37391": "Whence did it come?",
  "37392": "Do you remember that I paid it you ten days later, and you put it at the bottom of the tobacco?",
  "37393": "Did he mention the precise order of occupation to which he would addict himself?",
  "37394": "But be seated, and tell us now what is the cause of your docility?",
  "37395": "What the devil right have you to interfere?",
  "37396": "Has he decided to do so?",
  "37397": "And with how many fingers does he bless?",
  "37398": "Do you think I cannot see?",
  "37399": "If I preserve my purity in the society of the trees, why should he who would have me preserve it among men, seek to rob me of it?",
  "37400": "What had happened to bring this shocking change about?",
  "37401": "DID you see all the diamonds those ladies wore?",
  "37402": "How is that?",
  "37403": "With that?",
  "37404": "Did you recognize?",
  "37405": "What have we done, what has this poor thing done, that we are so sore beset?",
  "37406": "Must hate and death return?",
  "37407": "Why not view it often by faith?",
  "37408": "They are not fit for me, are they?",
  "37409": "Any lazy idle loafers that want flogging in this class?",
  "37410": "Why, then, do I not hear them?",
  "37411": "Do you accept my solution of the mystery?",
  "37412": "Not one year, madame?",
  "37413": "Was it right or wrong?",
  "37414": "Have you understood how our dog was so strangely thrown up out of the water of the lake, after his struggle with the dugong?",
  "37415": "How have you defended me?",
  "37416": "What are their sufferings?",
  "37417": "How about the widows and orphans confided to you?",
  "37418": "What have you got to do with the dew, ma'am?",
  "37419": "Is life to be purchased by such a sacrifice?",
  "37420": "What tell you me of fasting days?",
  "37421": "And have the children looked after themselves at all, sir?",
  "37422": "A dress for you, also, is it not, my friend?",
  "37423": "Coavinses?",
  "37424": "Had we a river, a lake, a sea to depend upon?",
  "37425": "But nobody possesses it, so what would you have?",
  "37426": "You have made it up?",
  "37427": "When is it to be done?",
  "37428": "How, then, could they provide for themselves, and when had they time to plough and sow their fields?",
  "37429": "Was her husband, to whom it legally belonged, to make it over to her as a free gift?",
  "37430": "Is what you hear at church, religion?",
  "37431": "And what enlargement do you expect to obtain in this way?",
  "37432": "Plans?",
  "37433": "What might be the consequences?",
  "37434": "Aren't you going to save those six monkeys who are giant soldiers?",
  "37435": "Would she have pitied him had she seen him?",
  "37436": "Aronnax?",
  "37437": "In your own heart, do you feel quite certain?",
  "37438": "But won't they know we're not?",
  "37439": "Or you, my lords, to be my followers?",
  "37440": "It is true?",
  "37441": "Then in time of peace justice will be of no use?",
  "37442": "But how could you guess what the motive was?",
  "37443": "What did you think of that?",
  "37444": "When will you come?",
  "37445": "Is it possible, then, to love, if you are not loved?",
  "37446": "Will you be her servants?",
  "37447": "Would she never issue from it?",
  "37448": "There's nothing wrong?",
  "37449": "NOT a party in anything, ma'am?",
  "37450": "Have I cut my heart into a demd extraordinary number of little pieces, and given them all away, one after another, to the same little engrossing demnition captivater, and can I live to be suspected by her?",
  "37451": "Then what?",
  "37452": "Supper?",
  "37453": "Can anyone do much for anyone else unless by making a will in his favour and dying then and there?",
  "37454": "Did we not leave her, but just now?",
  "37455": "Then?",
  "37456": "Has anything worried you?",
  "37457": "And who shall then stick closest to ye, and excite others?",
  "37458": "Can I rely upon you?",
  "37459": "Oh, you are the young feller who did that poster?",
  "37460": "I suppose you don't even know what a prig is?",
  "37461": "Don't you wish for anything else?",
  "37462": "Do you know of any houses?",
  "37463": "Do you mean to say that this slip of paper will help us?",
  "37464": "What identity?",
  "37465": "Did you bring the things I mentioned?",
  "37466": "But, my lord, if there be no secret of penitence, will the director consent to my being here?",
  "37467": "Do you have a faith, or a knowledge, you follow, which helps you to live and to do right?",
  "37468": "Is not this what we would have all men do to us?",
  "37469": "Well, there wasn't anything else for her to do, was there?",
  "37470": "You hussy, how dare you talk in that way?",
  "37471": "Now, what shall we do?",
  "37472": "Which should it be?",
  "37473": "Was it not natural, then, that I, who bring you tidings of a victory, should have the heart to utter a prayer for mercy, for which, as it seems, none of these noble and proud cavaliers could summon up courage?",
  "37474": "Will you follow me?",
  "37475": "What else can I do?",
  "37476": "How would you like to come into a house and find everyone muttering to themselves?",
  "37477": "And can the just by justice make men unjust, or speaking general can the good by virtue make them bad?",
  "37478": "You're sure?",
  "37479": "Prime, isn't it?",
  "37480": "Are we to see profound wisdom in this?",
  "37481": "Is it not, said she, whispering her husband in his ear, is it not a noble nose?",
  "37482": "Who'll keep THEM quiet?",
  "37483": "Had any difference arisen between him and her papa?",
  "37484": "And what shall I?",
  "37485": "Not so much so?",
  "37486": "You are fond of it?",
  "37487": "May I see it?",
  "37488": "Tell me, do you know what the countess, for whose pardon you are beseeching me, has done?",
  "37489": "Had she not openly avowed her intention of marrying for money if she ever had the chance?",
  "37490": "That the boy may sink and perish?",
  "37491": "Whose there?",
  "37492": "Been there long?",
  "37493": "Which is the way?",
  "37494": "Or his starch'd beard?",
  "37495": "Who knows what may be in store for you yet?",
  "37496": "By this?",
  "37497": "And not long?",
  "37498": "Is that certain?",
  "37499": "Isn't it well drawn?",
  "37500": "Are you asleep?",
  "37501": "Any ideas?",
  "37502": "Have we been deceived by an illusion?",
  "37503": "Was it physical?",
  "37504": "Caution?",
  "37505": "Did not you know that, my dear lord?",
  "37506": "Did not your friend here look like me?",
  "37507": "What are you rattling in there?",
  "37508": "But again, will they tell us that such a nature, placed under favourable circumstances, will not be perfectly good and wise if any ever was?",
  "37509": "Has not one of you a cross?",
  "37510": "What happened to the worthy captain?",
  "37511": "And what does the judge affirm to be the life which is next, and the pleasure which is next?",
  "37512": "Was my uncle stark mad?",
  "37513": "You didn't think it could be so bad?",
  "37514": "You mean she won't mind?",
  "37515": "Or have we found angels in the forms of kings to govern him?",
  "37516": "More in your brains than in your pocket, eh?",
  "37517": "He has come, then, as they told me?",
  "37518": "The only unofficial detective?",
  "37519": "Have you had lunch yet?",
  "37520": "Far from here?",
  "37521": "Whither is it carrying me?",
  "37522": "And where are they looking for her?",
  "37523": "Can't you see that I'm as hoarse as a crow?",
  "37524": "But where is your master?",
  "37525": "Who told you this?",
  "37526": "Would she have been more honest, more fit to grace an honest man's hearthstone, had she been the legitimate descendant of a score of legitimate duchesses?",
  "37527": "Of what was he thinking?",
  "37528": "Do you think it is too much?",
  "37529": "D'you remember you were rather sniffy about meeting him?",
  "37530": "Is that what you wished to say?",
  "37531": "How much of the ballast of conservatism and of loyalty to tradition is it well to throw overboard in the interest of accelerated motion?",
  "37532": "Shall a similar end be pursued for the ethical purpose of widening the circle of those who shall live and be happy?",
  "37533": "Why have they not seized me?",
  "37534": "When did it happen and what has happened?",
  "37535": "You see?",
  "37536": "How could we like a people who treated us so unjustly?",
  "37537": "When shall the day come when we shall lift our hands?",
  "37538": "Are you then making a thesis?",
  "37539": "Would you like me to bring some rice?",
  "37540": "Who do you want?",
  "37541": "How did he get 'em?",
  "37542": "You wouldn't leave him lying maimed at the bottom of this dreadful place, a moment, if you could bring help to him?",
  "37543": "And is my life to be forfeit, is some terrible punishment to come on my poor old head for that which I cannot help?",
  "37544": "You will be frank with me?",
  "37545": "And was that the head and front of his offending?",
  "37546": "And must he not be represented as such?",
  "37547": "Yes, don't you wish you knew what that card was?",
  "37548": "But what's he doing here?",
  "37549": "While he indulged himself in this state, amidst a profound silence, the curate, approaching him with great reverence, asked him if he would not be pleased to honour him with his company at dinner?",
  "37550": "He said nothing more?",
  "37551": "And even if he has done wrong, how do I know that he has not condemned himself?",
  "37552": "And do they give you frogs to eat, so's to make you limber?",
  "37553": "A doctor?",
  "37554": "What did you do?",
  "37555": "Would he allow imitation to be the ruling principle of his life, as if he had nothing higher in him?",
  "37556": "Wasn't it rather sudden?",
  "37557": "That's what you tell this gentleman too, is it?",
  "37558": "He's your husband, eh?",
  "37559": "In this century of bourgeoisie morality, in which I have had the honor to be born, the moral sense is so debased that I should not be at all surprised if I were asked, by many a worthy proprietor, what I see in this that is unjust and illegitimate?",
  "37560": "Can I spare him?",
  "37561": "What now?",
  "37562": "Armed?",
  "37563": "Or may not all three be properly allotted to it?",
  "37564": "Anything up?",
  "37565": "Is that so?",
  "37566": "You do not wish to hear it, perhaps?",
  "37567": "What does it matter to me?",
  "37568": "And will not a true astronomer have the same feeling when he looks at the movements of the stars?",
  "37569": "Why, what else are they?",
  "37570": "And s'pose he steps in here any minute, and sings out my name before I can throw him a wink to keep quiet?",
  "37571": "And the just is the good?",
  "37572": "How have I deviated from those principles, monsieur?",
  "37573": "But why FOUR pounds?",
  "37574": "And what did you find?",
  "37575": "What has he come here for?",
  "37576": "Are you inside?",
  "37577": "Downright?",
  "37578": "Do you think she'll miss you?",
  "37579": "Speak I sooth, my masters?",
  "37580": "Why was it necessary to weave the queen into this gloomy web of guilt and crime?",
  "37581": "I suppose that is why you live in town?",
  "37582": "What was the result of that memorable expedition?",
  "37583": "What, then, is the defence?",
  "37584": "What do you mean by risk?",
  "37585": "What would be the use?",
  "37586": "How could she make such nails work?",
  "37587": "Am I not the wife of my husband?",
  "37588": "What came after?",
  "37589": "Supposing her to be as good a woman as any you can find, which she certainly is not, why do you wish to connect yourself with anybody at present?",
  "37590": "What is the proposition?",
  "37591": "So?",
  "37592": "How is the snatchblatch?",
  "37593": "Just?",
  "37594": "Did you hear anything of it when you were in those parts?",
  "37595": "What is in this?",
  "37596": "And through what deplorable madness had she thus ruined her life by continual sacrifices?",
  "37597": "Where are the marks of its fangs?",
  "37598": "What d'you say to having something to eat?",
  "37599": "Who was this novice in war with the effrontery of a luminary?",
  "37600": "In my precinct?",
  "37601": "Is she, my lord?",
  "37602": "May this young lady go with us?",
  "37603": "Has no one come to seek her in this land?",
  "37604": "Hadn't we better hear it tomorrow?",
  "37605": "Then you'll be free?",
  "37606": "Monseigneur?",
  "37607": "Is it not sad?",
  "37608": "Can people enchant each other too much, cajole each other too much, charm each other too much?",
  "37609": "Why do they grease the axles of the wheels?",
  "37610": "If there be doubt as to which of our divisions will get our candidate, is there no doubt as to which of your candidates will get your party?",
  "37611": "What did you take me to your mother for?",
  "37612": "And did they ask you to make a speech?",
  "37613": "Don't you see it is hard enough for her already?",
  "37614": "Some such object it was, that induced you to call on me?",
  "37615": "But how about money?",
  "37616": "You here at this hour?",
  "37617": "Well, then, was it this eye or that through which you dropped the beetle?",
  "37618": "What did your excellency say?",
  "37619": "Will you then swear to me, that you will never, under any pretext, and from any motive whatsoever, betray to anybody, so much as a single word of what I am now about to tell you?",
  "37620": "Where are you going, you rascal?",
  "37621": "Do you know, my friends, what that plain, seen from the height we are at, resembles?",
  "37622": "What was the good of bringing him?",
  "37623": "Where was it?",
  "37624": "Would she be decent to him, or would she scold him?",
  "37625": "Which is the best wish to wish him?",
  "37626": "How CAN you say 'I am happier,' and nothing changed?",
  "37627": "Why sadden the poor children, and damp their newly cherished hopes?",
  "37628": "And you feel convinced that you must break with him?",
  "37629": "Alone, where?",
  "37630": "And you saw him frequently?",
  "37631": "Why is she so glad?",
  "37632": "But why do you ask?",
  "37633": "What new treasures lay here for science to unfold?",
  "37634": "What do ye want?",
  "37635": "Rochester?",
  "37636": "What's coming on?",
  "37637": "Are we to wonder, then, if here and there we find in his works an offensive expression?",
  "37638": "Why not cut it?",
  "37639": "What does the letter mean, mother?",
  "37640": "Are we rising into a fiery furnace?",
  "37641": "What substances will you proscribe?",
  "37642": "And what method of surveillance do you employ?",
  "37643": "Oh, well, as it were, what?",
  "37644": "You think so?",
  "37645": "Of how much?",
  "37646": "But we could not prevent it, could we?",
  "37647": "You get your percentage out o' the purchase, I suppose?",
  "37648": "Food enough for all?",
  "37649": "Why doesn't she want it now?",
  "37650": "On the other hand, would he not, by remaining to meet a fate almost inevitable, incur the guilt of suicide?",
  "37651": "Has she told you she likes me much?",
  "37652": "Why should I envy them?",
  "37653": "What did he say to you?",

  "37657": "Forty pounds?",
  "37658": "You'll have to, then, won't you?",
  "37659": "But I mean another piece?",
  "37660": "Are all voters enlightened?",
  "37661": "And his level, whether higher or lower, could it possibly be the same as hers?",

  "37671": "How came you by the knowledge?",
  "37672": "Is it not one part of honesty to be dutiful and grateful to your master, do you think?",
  "37673": "Why not win to freedom?",
  "37674": "Does he?",
  "37675": "And if not in the worst, why is it to follow at all?",
  "37676": "What, pray?",
  "37677": "Wherefore?",
  "37678": "Shall I be that?",
  "37679": "And what shall we say of such things as religious duties, of cheerfulness, of good manners, of personal cleanliness?",
  "37680": "Or, have you been a bad steward to yourself, and wasted your property in lawsuits and the like?",
  "37681": "Ah, who put it up?",
  "37682": "But light?",
  "37683": "What has opened her eyes?",
  "37684": "Do you want him?",
  "37685": "And would you indeed damn your precious soul?",

  "37691": "Don't you think so?",
  "37692": "Where's the use of looking nice, when no one sees me but those cross midgets, and no one cares whether I'm pretty or not?",
  "37693": "And the king has seen the cardinal?",
  "37694": "Detain him?",
  "37695": "And return to life, if there be such a thing, is the birth of the dead into the world of the living?",

  "37774": "Not come yet?",
  "37775": "Ever hear of lones the packer, hey, ole chappie?",
  "37776": "Is it quite original?",
  "37777": "Did he do that?",
  "37778": "Why should he trust himself to a balloon, that would blaze up like a piece of paper?",
  "37779": "Now, an't it?",
  "37780": "And don't I suppose his was the first face she saw, as she passed through the storm and the night to that waiting, beautiful place?",
  "37781": "You saw it?",
  "37782": "Like him?",
  "37783": "Would you take a seat, sir?",
  "37784": "And yet what else am I to do?",
  "37785": "Well, have you heard from your husband lately, my dear?",
  "37786": "You refused him?",
  "37787": "How did you know that?",
  "37788": "Can she make your real flecky paste, as melts in your mouth, and lies all up like a puff?",
  "37789": "Whence comes this?",
  "37790": "Yes, what is it?",
  "37791": "Should he stay at home with her, her mother and her sisters?",
  "37792": "What can I do to prevent it?",

  "37802": "Water to drink?",
  "37803": "You will not serve me, sir, will you?",
  "37804": "How should he be?",
  "37805": "Again, has he greater experience of the pleasures of honour, or the lover of honour of the pleasures of wisdom?",
  "37806": "Is it nothing to hold one's peace?",
  "37807": "And you can do nothing until then?",
  "37808": "When, where?",
  "37809": "Is there generally?",
  "37810": "Yes, but still all this has to be looked after, and who is there to look after it?",
  "37811": "You a chief, eh?",
  "37812": "How much will you give me for it?",
  "37813": "What have I to say to them?",
  "37814": "Now what do you think on't, neighbour, my friend?",
  "37815": "When are you coming back?",
  "37816": "Can anyone be surprised if one gets fond of such a ship?",
  "37817": "Oh, not her?",
  "37818": "If the loyal people united were put to the utmost of their strength by the rebellion, must they not fail when divided and partially paralyzed by a political war among themselves?",
  "37819": "But what is worship?",
  "37820": "Why do you not speak to me?",
  "37821": "In arms against me?",
  "37822": "Do you wish for a proof?",
  "37823": "I can't say more than that, can I?",
  "37824": "Where, then?",
  "37825": "Prove?",
  "37826": "Little woman?",
  "37827": "Shall it be said, good reader?",
  "37828": "Are you glad to leave us, dear?",
  "37829": "What had that harsh tyrant of hers done that was good or serviceable for her?",
  "37830": "And the mistress?",
  "37831": "Can one be well while suffering morally?",
  "37832": "Where would be that thrill if I had been as definite as a timetable?",
  "37833": "How long otherwise?",
  "37834": "Tony, where are you going, my charmer?",
  "37835": "What does this tell us?",
  "37836": "How does she use you?",
  "37837": "Have you nothing else to ask him, sir?",
  "37838": "In the nick of time?",
  "37839": "How?",
  "37840": "Mind it?",
  "37841": "How can I help myself?",
  "37842": "Where has he gone?",
  "37843": "That visit not succeeding either, you will go again perhaps?",
  "37844": "Husband, are you as kind and gentle toward your wife as you should be?",
  "37845": "For what is death?",
  "37846": "If I see, clearly see, that ladder leading from plant to man, why should I suppose it breaks off at me and does not go farther and farther?",
  "37847": "Lively?",
  "37848": "Another glass?",
  "37849": "But the great point is, is there a 'Rita' on the list?",
  "37850": "Why should he not try rather to fortify himself, to add to his courtiers, to continually obtain new subsidies, and finally to free himself from dependence on the people, the inevitable goal of all power originating in the people?",
  "37851": "Don't you hear?",
  "37852": "What was the difference whether the alms were given into my hands or into my wife's?",
  "37853": "Do you tell me that the woman is dead?",
  "37854": "Did he take that medicine, men?",
  "37855": "Who would suppose it?",
  "37856": "When was that done which settled the matter?",
  "37857": "What did you say, sir?",
  "37858": "Well and what am I to do now?",
  "37859": "I couldn't do anything better for her than advise her to accept these proposals, could I?",
  "37860": "What would be the result of a total extraction of the nitrogen?",
  "37861": "Do you not suspect?",
  "37862": "Did it keep you awake?",
  "37863": "Did he think that pride or masterful will or physical strength would help him?",
  "37864": "Need any help, officer?",
  "37865": "What's the row now?",
  "37866": "Why are you so bad?",
  "37867": "She never spoke to a soul?",
  "37868": "DO you think race corresponds with nationality?",
  "37869": "Could I ever have believed then that I could come to such humiliation?",
  "37870": "Do you belong to the nobility?",
  "37871": "D'you think they care for us?",
  "37872": "You bring me great news, then, monsieur?",
  "37873": "Did I say above, or seem to imply, that the judge sometimes spoke harshly to his wife?",
  "37874": "Not in health?",
  "37875": "And we have admitted that justice is the excellence of the soul, and injustice the defect of the soul?",
  "37876": "Did you really?",
  "37877": "What was he doing?",
  "37878": "Didn't you know the difference yourself?",
  "37879": "Is he out of his senses?",
  "37880": "Who then?",
  "37881": "Why do I feel so inclined to tease him?",
  "37882": "What monstrous place is this?",
  "37883": "Why can't you leave me alone?",
  "37884": "Where is the use of our reckoning?",
  "37885": "Why isn't it your business?",
  "37886": "Then you don't wish me to, dearest?",
  "37887": "You are AFRAID of it?",
  "37888": "Don't they come after it any more?",
  "37889": "Where is the prisoner?",
  "37890": "Is he generally liked?",
  "37891": "Do you mean write to her myself?",
  "37892": "So soon?",
  "37893": "Will not the guardians be the smallest of all the classes who receive a name from the profession of some kind of knowledge?",
  "37894": "A telegram?",

  "37898": "Which of them do you call her best friend?",
  "37899": "Is sugar always to be produced by vital blood?",
  "37900": "Was it a fear that he should deliver this name to the hazards of another memory than his own?",
  "37901": "You think it's certain he's there?",
  "37902": "Would they not have been as unwilling to part with them as with gold, and have compelled them to stay at home with them?",
  "37903": "Who did you pass on the road?",
  "37904": "What could she do but sob?",
  "37905": "What was that you told me before we left the old house?",
  "37906": "Beautiful and lusty?",
  "37907": "And is not the soul almost or altogether indissoluble?",
  "37908": "Buried amongst them, what met my eye?",
  "37909": "Yes, isn't it extraordinarily fine?",
  "37910": "What is the matter with him?",
  "37911": "Might he not well inform the doctor that he had something to tell him for his advantage?",
  "37912": "But how can we gain your freedom?",
  "37913": "Or is this a subject in which new discoveries can be made?",
  "37914": "Or haven't you pluck enough to go on?",
  "37915": "Has he got to be harnessed up and driven through life like a horse?",
  "37916": "What to do with him?",
  "37917": "If she had died, or if we hadn't caught her, where should we all have been?",
  "37918": "Assuming also, again I say, that physical obstacles can be overcome, is not the time opportune for making a start?",

  "37975": "Well, and what did the lady do?",
  "37976": "This has been done so often, and what good has ever come from it?",
  "37977": "Where do the lord and lady sleep?",
  "37978": "But whither am I wandering?",
  "37979": "With what kind of order?",
  "37980": "Why, then, refuse to follow to the end the road opened by science, and to admit an hypothesis which is the inevitable result of experience itself?",
  "37981": "But do you think we shall find the count at home?",
  "37982": "And what I am, to you my friends, now am I not?",
  "37983": "Do you conceive any thing but merely that perception?",
  "37984": "Don't you wish you may get it?",

  "37995": "Oh, when are you going?",
  "37996": "Why should I care?",
  "37997": "What could you do for a boy like that?",
  "37998": "Does it think?",
  "37999": "Why should we ask what comes after the experience, when the experience is still unknown to us?",
  "38000": "Was he not the prince of men?",
  "38001": "Are not these dread words for a nation bearing in her bosom so mighty an injustice?",
  "38002": "What has happened?",
  "38003": "How is a woman to live if she doesn't know how much she has got to spend?",
  "38004": "On what days?",
  "38005": "Or what hopes have we of deliverance by thus continuing faithful to such wicked wretches?",
  "38006": "Who's accused you?",
  "38007": "What's one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one?",
  "38008": "But the question again recurs, upon what pretense could he be put in possession of a force of that magnitude in time of peace?",

  "38014": "Don't you find, that things fail to materialise?",
  "38015": "Why not let me send for this pleasant lady?",
  "38016": "Where have you come from?",
  "38017": "Will somebody obleege me with a spittoon?",

  "38027": "What was the reply?",
  "38028": "Did business men commonly go into an expenditure of money which could be of no account to them?",
  "38029": "And then, in the next place, was it probable that the dean would act upon such a letter by filling up the vacancy, even if he did get it?",
  "38030": "And if not, WHO IS IN THE ROOM besides you and me?",

  "38047": "Ha, friend?",
  "38048": "And what about his wife and family?",
  "38049": "Is it necessary that a bourgeoisie which stands in such need of you should disown you?",
  "38050": "Suppose he were taken prisoner again?",
  "38051": "Now, my good fellow, how are you?",
  "38052": "She was about to say?",
  "38053": "Do you have a teaching?",
  "38054": "Has labor, once so fecund, likewise become sterile?",
  "38055": "Then what do you talk of?",
  "38056": "A signal for others?",
  "38057": "Who, and what are you?",
  "38058": "What then is that which is able to conduct a man?",
  "38059": "Well, what are these buildings?",
  "38060": "What does he want to go out for again?",
  "38061": "You know that great pause that comes upon things before the dusk?",
  "38062": "You wish me, then, to relate the history of my past sorrows?",
  "38063": "What the charm that floats the bowl?",
  "38064": "When did that happen?",
  "38065": "Are you sure they can be relied on?",
  "38066": "What will come of it all?",
  "38067": "Was there any mention made of my uncle or me?",
  "38068": "In what does it consist?",
  "38069": "Then I am not to be allowed to have anything to do with it officially?",
  "38070": "Can I go, can I go?",
  "38071": "You won't mind my working in your room this afternoon, will you?",
  "38072": "Is she a friend of yours?",
  "38073": "Or will you be my friend, as you have been hitherto, and do what I request?",
  "38074": "Do you mean it?",
  "38075": "What is that queer concern going down the river?",
  "38076": "Are you sure he can't get away?",
  "38077": "Was that all she said I said?",
  "38078": "But how cast off all the superfluous, devilish burden of my outer man?",

  "38090": "Do you suppose I am going to bring my ropes, my windlass, and set it up, and go down there with my boy and let myself be bitten, perhaps, by your cursed dog for the pleasure of giving it back to you?",
  "38091": "What will you do, then?",
  "38092": "What sort of a life could we build on such foundations?",
  "38093": "Ay, said I, but who can help constitution?",
  "38094": "Not chilled, pet, are you?",
  "38095": "Gone?",
  "38096": "Where had you seen me before?",
  "38097": "And if she won't tell?",
  "38098": "And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a fait accompli?",
  "38099": "And to sign the contract in three days?",
  "38100": "Could it be that the unfortunate man had committed suicide, overcome by his troubles?",

  "38113": "Then why did you come here, my dear?",
  "38114": "Why should my courtesie to these knights go all for naught?",
  "38115": "Was I, then, a monster, a blot upon the earth, from which all men fled and whom all men disowned?",
  "38116": "Could the latter for a moment suppose that the son would not offer the best part to the father?",
  "38117": "Why should she be sorry?",
  "38118": "Who, then, has counselled you to take this step, one for which the court is deeply indebted to you, and which is perfectly natural, considering your birth and your misfortunes?",
  "38119": "And so?",
  "38120": "Seek introductions, draw petitions up?",
  "38121": "How do we know what is at the bottom of his sudden interest in you?",
  "38122": "Wherefore?",
  "38123": "How do you account for this?",
  "38124": "And on what occasions have such favors been bestowed upon you?",
  "38125": "Do you think that will be really necessary?",
  "38126": "Any other letters?",
  "38127": "And where the prudence now that awed mankind?",
  "38128": "What will the ladies take for breakfast?",
  "38129": "Where did you learn how I speak of others?",
  "38130": "Does it hurt you so much?",
  "38131": "You are not angry with me?",
  "38132": "What if her interest in him were not so entirely that of a relative as it had formerly been?",

  "38134": "How is he my master?",
  "38135": "What on earth are we to do with him?",
  "38136": "Does it consist in the greater security afforded by a greater variety of parties, against the event of any one party being able to outnumber and oppress the rest?",
  "38137": "Should you like to sleep?",
  "38138": "Why, it may be asked, has the supposed creative force produced bats and no other mammals on remote islands?",
  "38139": "Should he not have a regard for his health and efficiency?",
  "38140": "Shall I tell you each ornament of your toilet?",
  "38141": "How does he get it, then?",
  "38142": "Can it be believed that they would thus act to no purpose during their courtship?",
  "38143": "How know you this man has?",
  "38144": "You aren't angry, are you?",
  "38145": "From whence, I ask, could he gain that knowledge, but from the study of the true theology?",
  "38146": "Was there ever such a sober, sentimental interview?",
  "38147": "And as it is to so go at all events, may we not agree that the sooner the better?",
  "38148": "Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?",
  "38149": "And why were you not willing?",
  "38150": "Are you so and so?",
  "38151": "Come, now, tell me, you want me very much to stay, don't you?",
  "38152": "May I suppose that you have this distinction of the visible and intelligible fixed in your mind?",
  "38153": "What's the good of getting away?",
  "38154": "Is it not adherence to the old and tried, against the new and untried?",
  "38155": "What can I do?",
  "38156": "Are or are not our interests conflicting?",
  "38157": "And by whom were they recommended to you?",
  "38158": "Paid according to the labor that they had performed, of what could they complain?",
  "38159": "And if it is proper to demand proof that justice should be done and the truth spoken, why may one not demand proof that men should be prudent and benevolent?",
  "38160": "What would his guards think if they heard him shout like a madman?",
  "38161": "How about the lion and the lioness?",

  "38183": "Was there an accident?",
  "38184": "May it be?",
  "38185": "Did I not see you trying to tear off another piece?",
  "38186": "Is it common sense, I ask you, to leave up windows which shut out all the daylight, and even confuse the eyes by throwing patches of colour, to which I should be hard put to it to give a name, on a floor in which there are not two slabs on the same level?",
  "38187": "Have you a name, then?",

  "38414": "If you meant no more than this when you first spoke to me, why should you not wish your brother to overhear what you said?",
  "38415": "But what am I to do?",
  "38416": "But for what purpose should ye have your pride in the morning and your resignation in the evening?",
  "38417": "But why did you come to me?",
  "38418": "How then shall we perform it?",
  "38419": "And you know these calculations?",
  "38420": "Is that what I wanted?",
  "38421": "Then why sit there where you oughtn't to?",
  "38422": "And can you ever forgive?",
  "38423": "Of her personal appearance?",
  "38424": "Pray, asked he, what is the true name of all these things in your country language?",
  "38425": "But why inflict unnecessary torture?",
  "38426": "Colia goes to see her often, does he not?",
  "38427": "Open the door, will yer?",
  "38428": "We'll see about that?",
  "38429": "Asia was the first nurse of the world, was she not?",
  "38430": "Kitty, you're not dancing the mazurka?",
  "38431": "Must I beat you?",
  "38432": "I wonder what he's got?",
  "38433": "You advertised a runaway servant, the other day?",
  "38434": "What is our crime?",
  "38435": "Is that long enough?",
  "38436": "Where could he go, then?",
  "38437": "Why should she have done such a thing?",
  "38438": "Up the chimney?",
  "38439": "Why shouldn't I flirt with her daughter?",
  "38440": "Don't, eh?",
  "38441": "You are the day porter, are you not?",
  "38442": "Is it not, indeed, the height of imprudence to grant equality of political rights to men of unequal conditions?",
  "38443": "Whom did it prosper?",
  "38444": "Has not art found that she is beautiful?",
  "38445": "The hopes and dreams so lately come, were they only hopes and dreams?",
  "38446": "But if you feel no indignation or compassion arise in you from this complication of circumstances, you would in vain ask him, in what consists the crime or villainy, which he so vehemently exclaims against?",
  "38447": "Who knows if she is right?",
  "38448": "An allusion to what?",
  "38449": "Do you think, my dear father and mother, there ever was so happy a creature as I?",
  "38450": "From what head could the lock be cut but mine?",
  "38451": "Why can't you be single by yourself, as you are always saying?",
  "38452": "Don't you know it?",
  "38453": "Will you never let us go?",
  "38454": "But what had happened to you?",
  "38455": "Are we quite alone, my friend?",
  "38456": "What is his name, and where do I find him?",
  "38457": "How are things going on at home?",
  "38458": "How are you, old neighbour?",
  "38459": "Do you mind if I come over to this table?",
  "38460": "What would you have done?",
  "38461": "Or must the discoverer of a continent prove a real occupancy, by performing the ridiculous task of the abnormal center of the mythical mathematical infinite circle, by being everywhere at the same time?",
  "38462": "Was it fear of not obtaining that succor I stood in need of, which agitated me to this degree?",
  "38463": "Are you then so little acquainted with your father as not to know that he would destroy us both if we should dare to set at naught his paternal and his royal authority?",
  "38464": "Is this going to suit every one?",
  "38465": "And why don't you take that other person?",
  "38466": "May I go and tell him you are here?",
  "38467": "When shall you be in?",
  "38468": "But he's very queer, isn't he?",
  "38469": "Your women, I believe, were something awful, were they not?",
  "38470": "No use at all?",
  "38471": "For whom?",
  "38472": "Who do you suppose is with me?",
  "38473": "Where did you get the mouth and chin from?",
  "38474": "Has he got her?",
  "38475": "Catherine?",
  "38476": "Will you not take your dispatch hence yet?",
  "38477": "What is generated from the living?",
  "38478": "Is there anything you want that would lessen the hardship of this confinement?",
  "38479": "Should I now?",
  "38480": "Do you not approve of my plan, my friend?",
  "38481": "Die?",
  "38482": "Is this all the distinction of the rich in the grave?",
  "38483": "Some have been served so?",
  "38484": "Shall I see you?",
  "38485": "But what is this, count, only one glass?",
  "38486": "Why should I not give him my heart, since, thanks to your intercession, I am no longer bound to choose a husband of equal birth?",
  "38487": "And for pirates?",
  "38488": "O, THAT'S your errand, is it?",
  "38489": "You weep for my danger?",
  "38490": "Are you the master of the boat?",
  "38491": "And what is easier than for an intelligent government to so manage all industrial transitions?",
  "38492": "Why is it, then, that this interest on capital is not regarded as a sufficient supplement of net product?",
  "38493": "She's not seriously hurt?",
  "38494": "Well, and for whom are you going to look for her?",
  "38495": "No smell?",
  "38496": "Of what tendency is that change?",
  "38497": "The effect of habits left?",
  "38498": "Is it you?",
  "38499": "Are we cannibals, let me ask?",
  "38500": "Which key was used to open it?",
  "38501": "Not to give me a kiss?",
  "38502": "Than any one at all?",
  "38503": "What pillar of security does the landed interest require more than any other interest in the state, or what right has it to a distinct and separate representation from the general interest of a nation?",
  "38504": "You've fed my body and saved my soul, haven't you?",
  "38505": "Something to my advantage?",
  "38506": "What did she really want?",
  "38507": "Have I done anything to you?",
  "38508": "Sermons?",
  "38509": "Didn't I make that interrigation point nice?",
  "38510": "This man?",
  "38511": "And he isn't conceited, is he?",
  "38512": "Forgot?",
  "38513": "How can the way of a superior man be such as to make fools of any of them?",
  "38514": "And did your superior order you to treat me in this way?",
  "38515": "Give me leave to crave your name, sir?",
  "38516": "And what lies beyond?",
  "38517": "Or the knowledge of all other things if we have no knowledge of beauty and goodness?",
  "38518": "How comes it, then, that he is prince of devils?",
  "38519": "Does the injustice or other evil which exists in the soul waste and consume her?",
  "38520": "Have you no sense to devise a system which will make you independent of all efforts, and all wills, but your own?",
  "38521": "Did I intend to insult him?",
  "38522": "And how do you do, sir?",
  "38523": "Have you been here ever since?",
  "38524": "What did I come here to seek?",
  "38525": "What is this business about?",
  "38526": "Where did you start up from?",
  "38527": "You repeated to yourself this morning the brief scene of last night?",
  "38528": "Isn't a girl allowed to change her mind?",
  "38529": "You let the cage alone, and let me wring its neck will you?",
  "38530": "For if he who resolveth bravely oftentimes falleth short, how shall it be with him who resolveth rarely or feebly?",
  "38531": "Which wings must I flop first?",
  "38532": "Will you talk sensibly?",
  "38533": "What time was that?",
  "38534": "Well, if you're happy, why don't you look happy, as we do?",
  "38535": "Are they not grotesquely trying?",
  "38536": "Then he has not returned?",
  "38537": "A worm of the earth in a carriage?",
  "38538": "And if not now, when?",
  "38539": "Is it in your dwelling?",
  "38540": "Did you suppose it wasn't going to rise?",
  "38541": "Would you not choose me rather than the other?",
  "38542": "What shall I say?",
  "38543": "And that running footman who waited at the door, and that carriage with a coachman in grand livery who sat waiting on his seat?",
  "38544": "I have told you, have I not, that you are too late?",
  "38545": "But do you not see that this is what you imply when you say that the soul existed before she took the form and body of man, and was made up of elements which as yet had no existence?",
  "38546": "And how was he to answer this?",
  "38547": "D'you WANT to come away with me?",
  "38548": "Do you think it a good one?",
  "38549": "Would he remember what took place in the relapse?",
  "38550": "And what do you call these?",
  "38551": "Who shall rebuild that building?",
  "38552": "SHALL I wish you good day for the present on the part of myself and the gentleman of the house?",
  "38553": "What kind of insect?",
  "38554": "It rings true, eh?",
  "38555": "Not good enough to stand it?",
  "38556": "How many times are you supposing that she has tried?",
  "38557": "And what similar use or power of acquisition has justice in time of peace?",
  "38558": "Will my bane perhaps come out of it?",
  "38559": "What can you give us for supper?",
  "38560": "Who shall go, then?",
  "38561": "Who was ever more ardently and deeply regretted?",
  "38562": "Who has not had their letters, with the wafers wet, and the announcement that a person is waiting in the hall?",
  "38563": "Expenses of journeys?",
  "38564": "Who said?",
  "38565": "My income?",
  "38566": "What am I to do at all?",
  "38567": "Or, do you mean that I am an atheist simply, and a teacher of atheism?",
  "38568": "Which means that you now hesitate?",
  "38569": "Well, are you going?",
  "38570": "No, but why do you think so?",
  "38571": "Do you wish to know the regulator of a society?",
  "38572": "Do you see any change in the water ?",
  "38573": "It would be very easy if you much wished it?",
  "38574": "Now can't you set aside these notions of yours?",
  "38575": "Did he, indeed?",
  "38576": "Lieutenant in the king's musketeers?",
  "38577": "But is not this his land?",
  "38578": "Mamma, couldn't I speak to her?",
  "38579": "In the left side, was it not, and with a knife?",
  "38580": "Don't you know I'm the soul of honour?",
  "38581": "How can I go and fetch that letter under the fire of the bastion?",
  "38582": "But, uncle, is it true?",
  "38583": "You are sure that is where he was going?",
  "38584": "Is the doctor here?",
  "38585": "Do you think that you wish to see him again?",
  "38586": "Is that a woman in breeches?",
  "38587": "And anybody could call you up at any time and talk?",
  "38588": "Was it not necessary in the end for men to sacrifice everything comforting, holy, healing, all hope, all faith in hidden harmonies, in future blessedness and justice?",
  "38589": "Well, you find it exciting too?",
  "38590": "Then this house does not belong to that tall lady who wears a watch, and who said we were to have some bread and cheese?",
  "38591": "For me?",
  "38592": "Do you think you will ever get to college?",
  "38593": "Aren't you glad I did it?",
  "38594": "Where does that light come from?",
  "38595": "Hasn't their uncle been heard from?",
  "38596": "Or whether we received a fair compensation for the extent of country ceded by these four individuals?",
  "38597": "And he is good in as far as he is wise, and bad in as far as he is foolish?",
  "38598": "Oh, that's what you're after, is it?",
  "38599": "And with her lover?",
  "38600": "Did it bite?",
  "38601": "What would become of her?",
  "38602": "You wonder I didn't go ashore for a howl and a dance?",
  "38603": "Why do you make a scene about it?",
  "38604": "Then you remember everything that went on about you from the time when you were three years old?",
  "38605": "Do you think it was all an illusion?",
  "38606": "But why so many precautions?",
  "38607": "Was ever the like heard, my dear father and mother?",
  "38608": "Mayn't I come too?",
  "38609": "Why not he?",
  "38610": "What is freedom for?",
  "38611": "Do they pretend that he named the man who lent me the money?",
  "38612": "Is that quite a little wish?",
  "38613": "And if not prayers, what then?",
  "38614": "So you'll give her the packet?",
  "38615": "Why are they running?",
  "38616": "What do you think of my situation?",
  "38617": "But where are we all going?",
  "38618": "Am I a sight, that you stand gazing there?",
  "38619": "Why, what is one to think?",
  "38620": "What did they expect of her?",
  "38621": "What would the result be, after marching blindly for so long and over such impossible ground, as we had been doing?",
  "38622": "Shall I then ever see this?",
  "38623": "To walk across the moor?",
  "38624": "Come now, what was this duel about?",
  "38625": "From whom comes this letter?",
  "38626": "What makes you behave so?",
  "38627": "Isn't it a dog?",
  "38628": "These gentlemen are with you?",
  "38629": "And what did you do?",
  "38630": "Hurt I modesty?",
  "38631": "Is there anyone I can write to for a reference?",
  "38632": "How much do you mean to say it wants then?",
  "38633": "In practice here?",
  "38634": "But would the subterranean fires provoke any violent eruption?",
  "38635": "Could it lie?",
  "38636": "Then you pity him?",
  "38637": "Was it hard to be free?",
  "38638": "Has he gone intending not to return?",
  "38639": "Your servant?",
  "38640": "Do bulbs live a long time?",
  "38641": "Ye NEW philosophers?",
  "38642": "Well, how did you get along?",
  "38643": "Were you dancing?",
  "38644": "When was it inhabited?",
  "38645": "Shall I help you?",
  "38646": "And one woman has a turn for gymnastic and military exercises, and another is unwarlike and hates gymnastics?",
  "38647": "What for use?",
  "38648": "Or was it possible that his guardian was anxious to prevent him from marrying from some view of the reversion of the large fortune?",
  "38649": "What is slang?",
  "38650": "There he is, do you see him?",
  "38651": "Just oblige me with that torch again, will you?",
  "38652": "And what classes of chance people come to practise at your gallery?",
  "38653": "Why was the expression of the whole face so cold and severe?",
  "38654": "Well, and was she standing with him, my good girl?",
  "38655": "And anything which is infected by any of these evils is made evil, and at last wholly dissolves and dies?",
  "38656": "And now, where are you going, viscount?",
  "38657": "Gunnar asked if he had ever sailed to other lands?",
  "38658": "How many centuries does a mind require to be understood?",
  "38659": "Did you not say she was dead?",
  "38660": "And she came to you?",
  "38661": "Isn't it?",
  "38662": "Have you really any great news to tell me?",
  "38663": "But you comprehend me?",
  "38664": "Or was it through your hard endurances of cold and hunger?",
  "38665": "Why, yes, didn't you know that?",
  "38666": "You think she wouldn't have run away?",
  "38667": "And what is your name?",
  "38668": "Suppose it should be a serpent?",
  "38669": "Will you give it up?",
  "38670": "Is it not because there would be something egregiously unfashionable in it?",
  "38671": "Is he in?",
  "38672": "How mend matters?",
  "38673": "Ho, ho, ho, ho, my good people, my friends and my faithful servants, must I hinder you from helping me?",
  "38674": "And should you like to fall into that pit, and to be burning there for ever?",
  "38675": "What is the day?",
  "38676": "But do you observe the reason of this?",
  "38677": "Why have them?",
  "38678": "And the heart trouble?",
  "38679": "How many of those?",
  "38680": "Who still wanteth to rule?",
  "38681": "Have we not seen dogs more faithful and intelligent than men, and men who are more stupid and brutal than any animals?",
  "38682": "Surely not?",
  "38683": "How do you know he is not the question now?",
  "38684": "To keep 'em safe, sir, don't you see?",
  "38685": "Can't you make them hear?",
  "38686": "Do you not know that even the men who are beaten with the iron rod of war, the heaviest rod in all the world, may still be ready to fight again, while the victims of terror cannot be brought to look their conquerors in the face, even when they try to comfort them?",
  "38687": "Or was it today, because it was so wet that I couldn't get out?",
  "38688": "That is so, isn't it?",
  "38689": "And why does he say no more?",
  "38690": "Are there not the children for you to mind?",
  "38691": "Are you certainly going tomorrow then?",
  "38692": "Why the devil, then, do we plague ourselves about money, when there is a diamond?",
  "38693": "Is it long since you saw her?",
  "38694": "Might I ask you a question or two?",
  "38695": "And must not an animal be a lover of learning who determines what he likes and dislikes by the test of knowledge and ignorance?",
  "38696": "Do you mean an old beau of hers?",
  "38697": "And how am I to get back?",
  "38698": "Will I join thy band?",

  "38703": "How comes it, father, that you treat me thus?",
  "38704": "How did tha' like th' seeds an' th' garden tools?",
  "38705": "But when?",
  "38706": "On the other and more friendly side, was it true that the vexatious passport system had been abrogated?",
  "38707": "What do you wish me to explain?",
  "38708": "What can you see?",
  "38709": "Have you really committed the crimes of which you are accused?",
  "38710": "Was it not honestly a trial to listen to an argument such as that?",
  "38711": "May he not come up here?",
  "38712": "And why is it your mother's opinion?",
  "38713": "Experience?",
  "38714": "In what legislation do we not find these fictions, which even yet exist, absurd and ridiculous as they are, among the ancient laws of modern nations?",

  "38728": "Will I promise?",
  "38729": "Don't know?",
  "38730": "Esperance?",
  "38731": "Can it be, then, that by that act of physical isolation, he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward worldly ties and connexions?",
  "38732": "Is it likely, if I have any project in hand that I ought to keep secret from you, I should tell you about it?",
  "38733": "And your name?",
  "38734": "He'll come to be scragged, won't he?",
  "38735": "What would he do, then?",
  "38736": "But do they know, at least, how to act circumspectly?",
  "38737": "Isn't she too young?",
  "38738": "Shall I live to get into it?",
  "38739": "Did you ever give him your promise, eh?",
  "38740": "Any affinity to wantonness and intemperance?",
  "38741": "What was to be done with the rebel armies when defeated?",
  "38742": "If he could not come himself, why, in the name of every thing rational, could he not have enclosed me a letter of presentation?",
  "38743": "What does that suggest to your mind?",
  "38744": "How shall I be sure that you will not compromise other persons equally unjustly?",
  "38745": "Shall I ask him to forgive me what I said yesterday?",
  "38746": "What do you say, my child?",
  "38747": "Why does she not come in?",
  "38748": "What thing?",
  "38749": "Is it really for love he is going to marry you?",
  "38750": "And why are they stopping?",
  "38751": "Where's the third?",
  "38752": "Daughters, where are ye?",
  "38753": "Now, I say, who are ye?",
  "38754": "What can this be?",
  "38755": "Could I ever have loved you, had I not known you better than you know yourself?",
  "38756": "Was a mere drudge to be employed?",
  "38757": "You have never gloated over me as the bird of prey gloats over the poor beast that is soon to become carrion beneath its claws?",
  "38758": "Do you suppose,' asked the second one, that you are the only living thing that craves with a hungry longing to hear the cuckoo's note again?",
  "38759": "But can you think of something else at this moment?",
  "38760": "A humourist too?",
  "38761": "What will she do?",
  "38762": "What degree of recognition should be given to the will of each individual, or to the separate volitions and desires in the life of the individual?",
  "38763": "But your family have been with us for several generations, have they not?",
  "38764": "And you too?",
  "38765": "And from being a keeper of the law he is converted into a breaker of it?",
  "38766": "Or why not grow a few extra fancy strawberries in the well cultivated spots about these trees?",
  "38767": "Courage?",
  "38768": "For in what does your strength consist?",
  "38769": "Because experience must have told me that I'm universally pleasing?",
  "38770": "But why not always be my place, if it is my duty now?",
  "38771": "And you wouldn't run away?",
  "38772": "In the first place, what is necessary to make the institution national?",
  "38773": "And his immense riches, whence does he procure them?",
  "38774": "Now, abbe, is everything arranged?",

  "40879": "Ah, truly?",
  "40880": "But what's the use of talking?",
  "40881": "Why the hell didn't you say so before?",
  "40882": "How's the show going?",
  "40883": "Shall we not be justified if we say that the end of physical evolution is the attainment of the perfection of animal form?",

  "41121": "Oh, what can I do for him?",
  "41122": "And how shall I travel, then?",
  "41123": "Oh, you agree, do you?",
  "41124": "Was he by himself?",
  "41125": "And what is it you'll say to me, and I after doing it this time in the face of all?",
  "41126": "And who's he?",
  "41127": "Does it interest you?",
  "41128": "What, my horse?",
  "41129": "But suppose he ISN'T honourable?",
  "41130": "Then he was certainly there?",
  "41131": "Surely your wife knew?",
  "41132": "Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?",
  "41133": "What is the reason of this sudden call?",
  "41134": "Do I find a fault, and nobody repairs it?",
  "41135": "Cried I, who carrieth his ashes unto the mountain?",
  "41136": "Is it a simple matter to keep silence?",
  "41137": "You have no faith in me?",
  "41138": "Is it any wonder that it rests with us now, with a bewildering sense of some power outside ourselves or our comprehension?",
  "41139": "How can you single out angels from among devils?",
  "41140": "Is it so very bad?",
  "41141": "Does that hurt you in any way?",
  "41142": "Shall I send the father to you?",
  "41143": "Are you quite alone, this year?",
  "41144": "Have I not given you to understand that, for a while at least, I would prefer to keep the contents of this epistle to myself?",
  "41145": "Can you say so?",
  "41146": "None of ye has been stealing what didn't belong to him?",
  "41147": "And here he proposed articles to you, I understand?",
  "41148": "The slab which closes the vault?",
  "41149": "How are matches made, except by bringing men and women together?",
  "41150": "Well, anyway, what ARE we going to do?",
  "41151": "But who is to carry you, said she, to your father and mother?",
  "41152": "You have nothing more to say?",
  "41153": "Who counsels best?",
  "41154": "What's the best place to stay at for the night round here?",
  "41155": "But whether made by one side or the other, would each side enjoy equal advantages on the trial?",
  "41156": "Not fear of the thunder, surely?",
  "41157": "Do you know he is a convict, a felon, a common thief?",
  "41158": "Who should know if I don't?",
  "41159": "For what do they commemorate as concerns you and myself?",
  "41160": "Meaning that you saw none?",
  "41161": "Work?",
  "41162": "Were you much hurt?",
  "41163": "Do you still think you found somebody fairer?",
  "41164": "Did he steal?",
  "41165": "Doesn't he feel important?",
  "41166": "What stage have they reached, sir?",
  "41167": "Will no one come?",
  "41168": "Well, what?",
  "41169": "Had he a whip in his hand?",
  "41170": "When was there ever a time when he had experienced happiness, felt a true bliss?",
  "41171": "He hadn't any money, had he?",
  "41172": "But can you not say that, sir?",
  "41173": "Why should I go back?",
  "41174": "Do you know what he did, sir?",
  "41175": "How far now can this negative mode of proceeding be carried?",
  "41176": "Why should you?",
  "41177": "And do you see that other one, who has an eagle and a dragon painted side by side upon his shield?",
  "41178": "Whence then was thy back created?",
  "41179": "Can I speak plainer?",
  "41180": "Who sent it?",
  "41181": "Will not a small body and a large one float the same way under the same influence?",
  "41182": "Can you give us any reason why we should not put you to death?",
  "41183": "Why had no word of any kind come from him?",
  "41184": "Made by whom?",
  "41185": "Have blows passed?",
  "41186": "And why was I so furious about it?",
  "41187": "Now, who was that someone?",
  "41188": "Who told you so?",
  "41189": "And can't we have a good time, too?",
  "41190": "How long is this thing going on like this?",
  "41191": "How much did it cost him?",
  "41192": "How are we today?",
  "41193": "Need I recall either the scene or the national circumstances attending the occasion?",
  "41194": "You're ready, are you?",
  "41195": "Of whom speak you?",
  "41196": "Do you know?",
  "41197": "What am I saying?",
  "41198": "Might not that influence be altogether disastrous?",
  "41199": "What shall I say of this man?",
  "41200": "Why don't you go on?",
  "41201": "Is it not the impiety of the inhabitants?",
  "41202": "Was he carrying a hat?",
  "41203": "Wasn't it, my wife?",
  "41204": "Can't you see you've wiped out everything?",
  "41205": "And the lustful and tyrannical desires are, as we saw, at the greatest distance?",
  "41206": "Who's there?",
  "41207": "When do you desire to go?",
  "41208": "The associate?",
  "41209": "But to whom, then?",
  "41210": "You feel strong enough to walk a little way now?",
  "41211": "What odds in that?",
  "41212": "And do you imagine he realizes all the awfulness of my position?",
  "41213": "Is the world, then, so narrow?",
  "41214": "Didn't you know that?",
  "41215": "When did music come this way?",
  "41216": "And what means have you to suggest, may I ask?",
  "41217": "What have we here?",
  "41218": "A spy?",
  "41219": "What are you worrying for, so long as he has money?",
  "41220": "Why did you ask me?",
  "41221": "What did these sealed mysterious letters bring him?",
  "41222": "How long will it take you to make up your mind?",
  "41223": "How of the window?",
  "41224": "And what did she for you?",
  "41225": "Well, how is your district council doing?",
  "41226": "Ought we not, then, to put our virtue and fortitude to the severest tests?",
  "41227": "May you come to me?",
  "41228": "What was his affair?",
  "41229": "Are you a magician?",
  "41230": "How long is it?",
  "41231": "Should you think all that pleasant enough if I forgave you?",
  "41232": "Were not these madmen common enough in such a prison?",
  "41233": "Of HIM?",
  "41234": "Where yeh hit?",
  "41235": "Is he hurt badly?",
  "41236": "What the devil is it all about?",
  "41237": "Does he now say that he did not make that promise?",
  "41238": "What was his name?",
  "41239": "Ferguson?",
  "41240": "Can it be that he was ashamed of me?",
  "41241": "Is it true, mother?",
  "41242": "Whither?",
  "41243": "But you prefer playing other people's accompaniments, to singing yourself, don't you?",
  "41244": "Shall I open the secretary?",
  "41245": "In what respect, madame?",
  "41246": "But what is an energumen?",
  "41247": "Who is it bids me hold?",
  "41248": "May I ask where you have taken up your quarters?",
  "41249": "Or, indeed, I might perhaps get a clerkship in a merchant's office?",
  "41250": "Are you a merchant?",
  "41251": "What injury?",
  "41252": "Did I startle you?",
  "41253": "The horse?",
  "41254": "Where did you get THAT idea from?",
  "41255": "Have you ever seen a man hanged?",
  "41256": "Not even your aunt?",
  "41257": "How would it be possible to explain all this to a judge and jury, so that they might neither say that he was dishonest, nor yet that he was mad?",
  "41258": "Why did you not tell me?",
  "41259": "Do you recall her features distinctly?",
  "41260": "At such a tender age could he have been conscious of his uncle's superiority to all those who surrounded him?",
  "41261": "She had a son, that unhappy woman?",
  "41262": "What was the occasion of this excited assemblage?",
  "41263": "But at a tremendous discount, of course?",
  "41264": "You wish to speak to me about the circumstance which has just happened?",
  "41265": "Was I not just telling you I despised it?",
  "41266": "How has this been proved?",
  "41267": "Do you mind?",
  "41268": "What does it say?",
  "41269": "Then this table is free?",
  "41270": "Who raised the money?",
  "41271": "And what might you think?",
  "41272": "Perhaps you dislike it?",
  "41273": "You see all these bags at the back of my cart?",
  "41274": "Whether they were a rich or a poor corporation?",
  "41275": "And how does he behave towards travellers?",
  "41276": "Have you kept in touch with the market while you have been out of work?",
  "41277": "I then asked him what he intended to do with the knife which had been found upon him?",
  "41278": "Have you ever noticed how much a thing is heightened in value when we obtain possession of it?",
  "41279": "I wish it would snow, don't you?",
  "41280": "But why should he go through the ceremony if he is not to live with her?",
  "41281": "Oh, is that it?",
  "41282": "I do not know?",
  "41283": "And how could he know that I should be such a simpleton as to believe him?",
  "41284": "Are you so unsociable that you cannot make friends?",
  "41285": "Repeal this statute, my good sir?",
  "41286": "Will you make up your mind at last?",
  "41287": "Do I not know human nature?",
  "41288": "Must I wrap them up?",
  "41289": "Why fear these titles, why this chieftain's strength?",
  "41290": "If he was going to treat her like that why did he ask her to come and live at the flat?",
  "41291": "But how can I send him away, since I have given him a rendezvous?",
  "41292": "H'm?",
  "41293": "Ever so far?",
  "41294": "What are you doing there?",
  "41295": "And how have I broken that treaty, your excellency?",
  "41296": "How are you, old fellow?",
  "41297": "Sister?",
  "41298": "No misfortune has happened to the queen?",
  "41299": "You advise me, then, to be reconciled to the abbe?",
  "41300": "You too come to see them off?",
  "41301": "What is the meaning of yonder singular building?",
  "41302": "Have you brought his indentures with you?",
  "41303": "From whence, then, came this prostration?",
  "41304": "Is not ambition but an endless ladder by which no height is ever climbed till the last unreachable rung is mounted?",
  "41305": "Are you staying to talk?",
  "41306": "In what relation must she salute you as her uncle, or as her husband?",
  "41307": "Do the races or species of men, whichever term may be applied, encroach on and replace one another, so that some finally become extinct?",
  "41308": "Don't you realise that you're enjoying a very rare, a very exquisite privilege?",
  "41309": "Your crime?",
  "41310": "What have I been waiting for?",
  "41311": "Morrel?",
  "41312": "Or what does she mean?",
  "41313": "Has he got the financial basis arranged then?",
  "41314": "A little?",
  "41315": "Who goes there, yourselves?",
  "41316": "Will nothing of it remain?",
  "41317": "What will we get?",
  "41318": "But what's the use of talking of gorgeous rooms?",
  "41319": "Why did you sin?",
  "41320": "What necessity was there to expatiate on her brother's drunkenness?",
  "41321": "Could we lend you anything?",
  "41322": "I hope number two's as good?",
  "41323": "Provided there is no scene, why shouldn't we meet?",
  "41324": "Wasn't the old cat in a rage when she found out?",
  "41325": "Are they weighing the shekels of the tabernacle ?",
  "41326": "Is it all past over?",
  "41327": "My heart, who is there upon earth that I could miss so much?",
  "41328": "If it is I you do love, O how can it be that you look and speak so?",
  "41329": "Shall I clamber across, or will you come to the plank above here?",
  "41330": "Have they calculated upon the inevitable consequences of this abdication?",
  "41331": "Plural?",
  "41332": "Why no king?",
  "41333": "Why had her family cast her off?",
  "41334": "And what will you do in that case?",
  "41335": "Why?",
  "41336": "Were they good to you?",
  "41337": "And why not?",
  "41338": "Whither shall I fly?",
  "41339": "Where is such an education as this to be had?",
  "41340": "Wouldn't you like some russets?",
  "41341": "Have you any more business here?",
  "41342": "You would follow the escort?",
  "41343": "Are you superhuman?",
  "41344": "But what good effect can the latter mode of worship have on the moral conduct of a rational being?",
  "41345": "Why, how, when my money is gone, my complexion gone, my life gone, and my slipper gone?",
  "41346": "Do we desire to make such ruthless combinations and monopolies lawful?",
  "41347": "Whose sword?",
  "41348": "You will go to sleep there, I suppose, won't you?",
  "41349": "There, do you hear?",
  "41350": "You do believe in my grandmother, then?",
  "41351": "Do you feel ill, sir?",
  "41352": "How did that ivory come all this way?",
  "41353": "Hadn't you better get your pistols?",
  "41354": "Is there confusion in the little isle?",
  "41355": "What lay behind it or within it?",
  "41356": "Why have they not been here?",
  "41357": "But, doctor, you are not going to quarrel with us?",
  "41358": "What the devil are you driving at?",
  "41359": "When did it come to your knowledge?",
  "41360": "You do not comprehend ?",
  "41361": "Do you swear it?",
  "41362": "With your lasso you could stop an ox?",
  "41363": "Why, what do you call yourselves?",
  "41364": "And the corpse?",
  "41365": "You will give me your hand, will you not?",
  "41366": "Was it a girl or a boy?",
  "41367": "From whom?",
  "41368": "Why had she bidden him to come early if she was having people to dine?",
  "41369": "Was it yesterday?",
  "41370": "Shall I see something very uncommon?",
  "41371": "Could she see?",
  "41372": "Are those all they've left us?",
  "41373": "All?",
  "41374": "Where was now the dwarf?",
  "41375": "And isn't herself the divil's daughter for locking, and she so fussy after that young gaffer, you might take your death with drought and none to heed you?",
  "41376": "Was that so?",
  "41377": "Edinburgh wouldn't do, I suppose?",
  "41378": "What hideous, furtive hand is that which is slipped into the pocket of victory?",
  "41379": "Do you know who the other is?",
  "41380": "And does the essence of the invariable partake of knowledge in the same degree as of essence?",
  "41381": "And do you wish to behold what is blind and crooked and base, when others will tell you of brightness and beauty?",
  "41382": "And what have master pastrycooks to do with us?",
  "41383": "Why will you ask me to do these things?",
  "41384": "With what view?",
  "41385": "What have you against me?",
  "41386": "Are you going much farther?",
  "41387": "How nothing?",
  "41388": "Were you in that lighter?",
  "41389": "What came of such an event?",
  "41390": "S'pose I don't?",
  "41391": "Why stop?",
  "41392": "And how long has this been going on?",
  "41393": "As soon as may be?",
  "41394": "Are we descending?",
  "41395": "First of all, if he had left it complete, would sixteen years have gone by before it was printed?",
  "41396": "Couldn't dey leave me one?",
  "41397": "Where would you put this?",
  "41398": "Who insists?",
  "41399": "Do they droop and end their lesson, wearied over there beyond the seas?",
  "41400": "Or to do anything?",
  "41401": "Why, is that your name?",
  "41402": "Wherefore ruin so fair a body?",
  "41403": "And who was the first?",
  "41404": "Do you promise?",
  "41405": "She is modest enough to love even you?",
  "41406": "Where then was my guardian angel?",
  "41407": "Didn't he call me a dog?",
  "41408": "You insist on pistols?",
  "41409": "What IS that truck?",
  "41410": "What row?",
  "41411": "Won't he shout when I tell him what those silly things say about us poor children?",
  "41412": "If it had not been for that lucky waggon, who knows what would have happened?",
  "41413": "What is the reason of all this?",
  "41414": "And why did he bob and beat you, sirrah?",
  "41415": "What collection of facts is scanty?",
  "41416": "How shall the government, which by the hypothesis is everything, become an obedient servant, a subordinate organ?",
  "41417": "Corney?",
  "41418": "But you will be at the games?",
  "41419": "Is it really you?",
  "41420": "Love it?",
  "41421": "What shall I do, mamma?",
  "41422": "What's all this about diamonds?",
  "41423": "Why did you come between my love and me?",
  "41424": "When such as I, who have no certain roof but the coffinlid, and no friend in sickness or death but the hospital nurse, set our rotten hearts on any man, and let him fill the place that has been a blank through all our wretched lives, who can hope to cure us?",
  "41425": "He has obtained the decoration for me?",
  "41426": "If that be so, what must she think of me if I stay away from her now?",
  "41427": "Shall it be a week, a month, a year?",
  "41428": "But if they had quarrelled so bitterly, why had her father the very next day urged her to marry him?",
  "41429": "What is to be done?",
  "41430": "Was she paintable?",
  "41431": "And then, whither was he to go?",
  "41432": "How long have I been mad?",
  "41433": "Why have we no father, like other boys?",
  "41434": "Who would recognize him now?",
  "41435": "He would soon present a healthy mind to the world again, and what did he or the world care if he was rotten at the core?",
  "41436": "And when was the engagement actually settled?",
  "41437": "You have never been a companion before, have you?",
  "41438": "How did you hear of him?",
  "41439": "Why should they not do good?",
  "41440": "Where, then, lies the solution of the social problem?",
  "41441": "Then there is no cure for it?",
  "41442": "Does not this appear strange to you?",
  "41443": "And, anyway, how did he know?",
  "41444": "How is it you're only just qualified?",
  "41445": "What book?",
  "41446": "You don't feel angry with him, do you?",
  "41447": "Bobbsey?",
  "41448": "Are you a subject for the mad hospital?",
  "41449": "Left, why did you leave?",
  "41450": "Why did you not say so?",
  "41451": "Whuzzit you wammme do?",
  "41452": "And living in this way we shall have much greater need of physicians than before?",
  "41453": "Why, had they not been sailing persistently to the east?",
  "41454": "Could you raise a flower here, do you reckon?",
  "41455": "Fight our way through?",
  "41456": "Me get married?",
  "41457": "Then you admit you have arrested me?",
  "41458": "Have you made the tour of the mansion?",
  "41459": "What if her fourteen bairns had been resteeped to the hips in poverty by the morbid sentimentality of their father?",
  "41460": "Isn't that grand?",
  "41461": "You are very poor, ain't you?",
  "41462": "You knew the poor lad, then?",
  "41463": "What know you of him, cousin?",
  "41464": "That's why you are going, is it?",
  "41465": "Do you dance?",
  "41466": "Has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant?",
  "41467": "What depth have we?",
  "41468": "Is not this a sale of the right to travel?",
  "41469": "Ain't you got no beer here?",
  "41470": "Isn't that clever?",
  "41471": "Why, what did she mean by that?",
  "41472": "Odorem pudendorum amicæ?",
  "41473": "What will happen if I try to divide this estate decently among decent people?",
  "41474": "That's true, isn't it?",
  "41475": "But I say, you know, what about me?",
  "41476": "When is the war to commence?",
  "41477": "You do not know?",
  "41478": "They who suffer me to remain may in a moment drive me away, and can I hope my persecutors, seeing me happy, will leave me here to continue to be so?",
  "41479": "How do you like your work?",
  "41480": "Steady?",
  "41481": "Was it natural, was it effort?",
  "41482": "Kin you keep awake that long?",
  "41483": "Now, does that signify a jot?",
  "41484": "Are you too harsh and rough?",
  "41485": "Is the fool drunk?",
  "41486": "Shall I strike that?",
  "41487": "When have you found me unmindful of your lessons?",
  "41488": "But I would ask you how did this man know that you lived here, or how to get into your house, or where to hide to get you?",
  "41489": "Did you forbid them to come?",
  "41490": "An old woman?",
  "41491": "And do you?",
  "41492": "You do not, I suppose, want our horses to clamber up on the roof of the carriage in front of us?",
  "41493": "And what was thy mother?",
  "41494": "Where has he gone?",
  "41495": "But d'you think he'll be satisfied with a man who's only just qualified?",
  "41496": "How much have you a year?",
  "41497": "You WILL put it to her yourself then?",
  "41498": "Would he have been doing that?",
  "41499": "What could all this mean?",
  "41500": "With your uncle?",
  "41501": "Has your husband written to you yet?",
  "41502": "At what o'clock did the battle begin?",
  "41503": "Which prison is he from?",
  "41504": "Whom have we got?",
  "41505": "Why do you shake your head and look so glum?",
  "41506": "How long is the coffin?",
  "41507": "What do men usually say to cabmen?",
  "41508": "To whom can they go?",
  "41509": "Can't you fill in the rest yourself?",
  "41510": "Do you smoke, child?",
  "41511": "But had it been bad, why should we pronounce it dishonest?",
  "41512": "What do I lack in your eyes?",
  "41513": "Then what is the theory in your mind?",
  "41514": "Murderers of whom?",
  "41515": "To be put to death by mine own people, and render my memory a disgrace to my family and my nation?",
  "41516": "Why did she bear a grateful heart because they had met, and feel it pain to think that they would shortly part?",
  "41517": "You don't want to stay away from me, do you?",
  "41518": "You have been going often yourself, then, lately?",

  "42664": "You will not eat any of my salmon while I am away?",
  "42665": "What brings you here?",
  "42666": "And will that save my unhappy men?",
  "42667": "This is justum impedimentum, I hope, error personae?",
  "42668": "Well, and to you?",
  "42669": "Could they have made a confidante of the woman?",
  "42670": "What sort of a boy is he?",
  "42671": "What blasphemy is this, dog of a pirate?",
  "42672": "Do you know the name?",
  "42673": "What do they say is the trouble?",
  "42674": "Wherefore cease we, then?",
  "42675": "Your mother's dead, isn't she?",
  "42676": "Why did you go alone?",
  "42677": "My messenger reached you, then?",
  "42678": "Who can compass it?",
  "42679": "Have you ever lived abroad?",
  "42680": "But, after all, who is she?",
  "42681": "George, is it you?",
  "42682": "Do you think mother is abnormal?",
  "42683": "Do you want a drink?",
  "42684": "Did you ever build one when you were a boy?",
  "42685": "What is this man's name?",
  "42686": "But, what do I say?",
  "42687": "Do you know, monsieur, of whom you remind me this evening?",
  "42688": "Are you afraid of him?",
  "42689": "Colour of his eyes?",
  "42690": "Would you believe it that there is not a chart on board?",
  "42691": "How much have we in hand?",
  "42692": "Going aboard?",
  "42693": "Are we again on the surface of the globe?",
  "42694": "I may take my turn in talking a little about myself?",
  "42695": "Under what condition is the will of the people delegated to one person?",
  "42696": "What is that to me?",
  "42697": "Why, what can have happened?",
  "42698": "Have I a chance of getting any of it?",
  "42699": "Are they not quickly told and quickly gone?",
  "42700": "It's come back?",
  "42701": "How did they happen to be so little?",
  "42702": "Is he married?",
  "42703": "But must it not be witnessed?",
  "42704": "Besides, have I no confidence in myself?",
  "42705": "What do you call righting yourself?",
  "42706": "Is that well?",
  "42707": "Is that the way to treat my friends?",
  "42708": "Why did you slip away by stealth like this?",
  "42709": "Then somebody does come?",
  "42710": "No international difficulty ever arise to enable us to declare war against some transatlantic power?",
  "42711": "And how shows this recreant conduct in a man on whom unequal laws are known to have fallen heavy?",
  "42712": "What have you got to say for yourself?",
  "42713": "What if I were to put my melons into their greatcoats?",
  "42714": "How the devil do you keep it up?",
  "42715": "One of those attempts which, as you said at the beginning of this conversation, alters the fate of empires?",
  "42716": "How would it suit you to be a night watchman?",
  "42717": "Have you brought a boat?",
  "42718": "What can we do about it?",
  "42719": "Do you believe that all things were created by him, and that all beings are dependent on him?",
  "42720": "How came you to court her?",
  "42721": "Were you never given any sort of an education?",
  "42722": "Then we may form our opinion?",
  "42723": "Ought I not to begin by describing how the change from timocracy to oligarchy arises?",
  "42724": "Are you for it?",
  "42725": "Snagsby?",
  "42726": "How, and why?",
  "42727": "Well, monsieur, do you know who this great lady is?",
  "42728": "Is it the mere force of life which is determined to be, or the consciousness of self which cannot be got rid of, or the fire of genius which refuses to be extinguished?",
  "42729": "Under my clothes?",
  "42730": "Have you no supper, brother?",
  "42731": "Where are we?",
  "42732": "What did she have to say?",
  "42733": "Wherefore?",
  "42734": "Aye, little brother?",
  "42735": "And when are we to start, your excellency?",
  "42736": "Is she sentenced?",
  "42737": "How is mamma?",
  "42738": "You will, eh?",
  "42739": "Do you, too, agree to his giving away the hay you need for your own flocks, giving it away until you haven't enough for yourselves?",
  "42740": "What's going on up there?",
  "42741": "Isn't it so, mamma?",
  "42742": "Rides well, eh?",
  "42743": "I want to know whether ideals are ever fully realised in language?",
  "42744": "And the business?",
  "42745": "What mausoleum were for such a chief A fitting monument?",
  "42746": "Shall we say so?",
  "42747": "O, pshaw, cousin, what's the use?",
  "42748": "One of the condemned?",
  "42749": "Why didn't you say who YOU were?",
  "42750": "Should I stop the service and make a scene in the church?",
  "42751": "I may count on you, may I not, and quickly?",
  "42752": "But tell me, how should this be possible?",
  "42753": "How much may it come to?",
  "42754": "Ye preach patience with what is earthly?",
  "42755": "And you laid the foundation of your fortune in the midst of all those songs?",
  "42756": "Would it be a very hard lesson, dear?",
  "42757": "But how did you become concerned in this villainous affair?",
  "42758": "What do you say to this, mother?",
  "42759": "What is the result?",
  "42760": "Or else?",
  "42761": "But who are your captains?",
  "42762": "You're not going to marry him, do you hear?",
  "42763": "How are you and your swell friend making it?",
  "42764": "Is that how you look at it?",
  "42765": "Seriously, can that be applied to a man of income, who has no other possession under the sun than the market, and in his pocket his money?",
  "42766": "Whereabouts were his former haunts?",
  "42767": "Will you stop smiling in that inscrutable way and tell me what you mean?",
  "42768": "Whose is that letter of your mistress?",
  "42769": "Isn't your wife going to warm your bed for you?",
  "42770": "Is this not purely good?",
  "42771": "Are you trying to frighten me?",
  "42772": "How, could anyone get into his room?",
  "42773": "I like a booby was crying, can you beat it?",
  "42774": "Did you inquire around for HIM when you got loose?",
  "42775": "Are you, sir, the chief of the people who brought me here?",
  "42776": "Nothing?",
  "42777": "Cannot the war be ended at once?",
  "42778": "Will you do me a favor, queen?",
  "42779": "What was that expression you used?",
  "42780": "Was she, then, so clearly in his mind?",
  "42781": "Snobby's a carpenter, ain't it?",
  "42782": "Dern your skin, ain't the company good enough for you?",
  "42783": "What should one love and what hate?",
  "42784": "If it was true, why was it not writ till five days after the proclamation?",
  "42785": "Or because a man is in good health when he receives pay you would not say that the art of payment is medicine?",
  "42786": "Why are you so glum?",
  "42787": "Even among the poor, who would willingly marry the child of a man who had been hanged?",
  "42788": "Who and what are you, and why are you here?",
  "42789": "And he was guilty?",
  "42790": "Gone out?",
  "42791": "A whole scene?",
  "42792": "Did you have any trouble sneaking them away?",
  "42793": "Earth being so good, would heaven seem best?",
  "42794": "And if that be enchantment, as your worship says, was there no other pair in the world for them to take the likeness of?",
  "42795": "What is a kiss?",
  "42796": "My dear girl, what has he done?",
  "42797": "If it should turn out to be all wrong?",
  "42798": "Is there any external evidence to support this grave accusation?",
  "42799": "Tim, you villain, what do you say to that, sir?",
  "42800": "Why give that?",
  "42801": "Did you ever see anything more perfect than her acting?",
  "42802": "And how long will it take you to reach home?",
  "42803": "And we are pursuing the duke with the very horses he has just left?",
  "42804": "Where was there any proof to the contrary?",
  "42805": "Oh, what's that?",
  "42806": "Did you fall from heaven?",
  "42807": "Is it not a greater service to place souls in heaven than to bury bodies in the earth?",
  "42808": "What the devil do you mean?",
  "42809": "Leave any for him?",
  "42810": "Did you notice the face he pulled when he saw that she wasn't here?",
  "42811": "Your second condition for going, if you please, sister?",
  "42812": "Have you gone out of your wits in your office?",
  "42813": "Who is to know who was everybody's father?",
  "42814": "Don't they heat them at all?",
  "42815": "But would any number of men hare dreamed of resorting to such an expedient?",
  "42816": "Repeal it, my dear sir?",
  "42817": "You know the name I formerly bore, sir?",
  "42818": "Are you satisfied, sir?",
  "42819": "S'pose you're the person we go into camp for, eh?",
  "42820": "A he, is it?",
  "42821": "Whither wanders thy distemper'd mind?",
  "42822": "You surely don't think of mounting a mass like that upon a carriage?",
  "42823": "You don't care to oblige us?",
  "42824": "What was his name?",
  "42825": "How can she write letters to HER, if she's mad?",
  "42826": "You're jealous, is it, of her wedding me?",
  "42827": "Had you no mother?",
  "42828": "And what do you believe?",
  "42829": "My shadow calleth me?",
  "42830": "Not in this place, surely?",
  "42831": "For why should the slaughter of an ox or a sheep be a greater wrong than the felling of a fir or an oak, seeing that a soul is implanted in these trees also?",
  "42832": "Did not your majesty say so?",
  "42833": "Have I your leave to go, dear?",
  "42834": "But are your beliefs, we should ask, based on historical fact?",
  "42835": "Tell me what?",
  "42836": "Well, wouldn't I rather be the fool I am, than that flea downstairs?",
  "42837": "Glory waits our toil?",
  "42838": "Am I queer?",
  "42839": "So much?",
  "42840": "So that you may be avoided?",
  "42841": "Is it a hoax?",
  "42842": "You might have paid it in there?",
  "42843": "May I congratulate you?",
  "42844": "But what conclusion have they come to?",
  "42845": "What IS the matter with your pap?",
  "42846": "Of it?",
  "42847": "But I may come the next day?",
  "42848": "Why do you bother about humanity?",
  "42849": "Quite free, my lady?",
  "42850": "But why was the ship coming there?",
  "42851": "And is not a similar method to be pursued about the virtues, which are also four in number?",
  "42852": "Do you really travel through time?",
  "42853": "Could their fragile boat hold out on a long trip?",
  "42854": "You are going, then?",
  "42855": "Do you object to say at sunrise?",
  "42856": "Where are the shoes?",
  "42857": "Do you not know that it would be better for yourself that you should be married?",
  "42858": "What money is that?",
  "42859": "Did you?",
  "42860": "What sort of a garden is it?",
  "42861": "Now, why do you spend so much of your time before this mirror?",
  "42862": "Shall I call this happy news, or dreadful but profitable?",
  "42863": "Wasn't that exciting?",
  "42864": "He would discover many things in you he could not have expected to find?",
  "42865": "Our lieutenant?",
  "42866": "What you been doing in there?",
  "42867": "Are these cetaceans as large as those of the northern seas?",
  "42868": "Why should anyone laugh at locksmiths?",
  "42869": "And he lives?",
  "42870": "Where's the sail and mast?",
  "42871": "How, it has been asked, can an end, which does not, as yet, exist, be a cause which sets in motion the apparatus that brings about its own existence?",
  "42872": "In the middle of the day?",
  "42873": "What was the name of your old master?",
  "42874": "What do the common people think of me?",
  "42875": "You are not joking with me?",
  "42876": "How can one talk to one's doctor openly and confidentially when one looks upon him as one's worst enemy?",
  "42877": "Is it not clear enough?",
  "42878": "And you will see him before you go?",
  "42879": "Well, my dear, why shouldn't he be?",
  "42880": "Can you cause things to fall off the earth against the law of gravitation?",
  "42881": "Why, don't you know?",
  "42882": "How do you mean to pay the monstrous expenses of this action?",
  "42883": "Is it in safety?",
  "42884": "But do you suppose that I care what you say?",
  "42885": "What is the meaning of this?",
  "42886": "Why should there be?",
  "42887": "Why so pale?",
  "42888": "Yes, and when shall I see you again?",
  "42889": "Who told you about him?",
  "42890": "And where are you going to sleep?",
  "42891": "How can the divine law of causality be so unreasonable?",
  "42892": "She curled her hair and showed her shoulders at him, as much as to say, did ye ever see such jet ringlets and such a complexion?",
  "42893": "What was the noblest life that perished there?",
  "42894": "Isn't it splendid of him?",
  "42895": "Now what shall I do?",
  "42896": "All sorts of mornings are interesting, don't you think?",
  "42897": "Never?",
  "42898": "For example, I said, can the same thing be at rest and in motion at the same time in the same part?",
  "42899": "Think ye it is because of the affection she bears me?",
  "42900": "What was she to do now?",
  "42901": "Where's your intelligent understanding of the daily papers?",
  "42902": "And lives he still, then?",
  "42903": "Why should that be?",
  "42904": "How far is that hut from here?",
  "42905": "If so, why are there only traces of the assassinated girl?",
  "42906": "You remember that view, with its sharp line of demarcation?",
  "42907": "How long have you been suffering like this?",
  "42908": "How is this precipitation to be explained?",
  "42909": "But what are we to conclude with respect to certain birds in which, for instance, the eyes differ slightly in colour in the two sexes?",
  "42910": "Is it, sir?",
  "42911": "Could I not snap the bond?",
  "42912": "What cheese?",
  "42913": "And our share?",
  "42914": "What more could the spirits want?",
  "42915": "Is it to monsieur that you wish to speak?",
  "42916": "Is political and civil inequality just?",
  "42917": "Why, my dear?",
  "42918": "SHE spiritual?",
  "42919": "Then who are you?",
  "42920": "Hey, sir?",
  "42921": "Could you keep a secret, if I told you one?",
  "42922": "Are you going to take this bird with you also?",
  "42923": "Some brandy?",
  "42924": "Did you fear that we should forget it?",
  "42925": "What heavenly particle inspires the clay?",
  "42926": "Is all else bare?",
  "42927": "The question is, how is that object to be attained?",
  "42928": "Or would the sight of it bring recollections calculated to enervate and distress?",
  "42929": "But what is he ferreting for?",
  "42930": "Who dares at my court be a protector of heretics?",
  "42931": "Will we ever get there?",
  "42932": "Is that far, sir?",
  "42933": "Is it thus you perform your charge, monsieur?",
  "42934": "Where I am going to be married?",
  "42935": "But there has been some official investigation?",
  "42936": "Do you not think that they have sent for you, both for the same thing?",
  "42937": "Teeth, you mean?",
  "42938": "Where are that old man and that child you speak of?",
  "42939": "Who's got it now, d'you know?",
  "42940": "What is his crime in its moral aspects, to merit such a judgment?",
  "42941": "Not to one?",
  "42942": "You have a boat of your own, nevertheless?",
  "42943": "And had you been captain, should you have retained him in his employment?",
  "42944": "But what is the meaning of this change?",
  "42945": "Can you really do such wonderful transformations?",
  "42946": "Some new relics?",
  "42947": "At his house?",
  "42948": "Are you very much in love with her?",
  "42949": "Am I not sick?",
  "42950": "Is something the matter?",
  "42951": "What can you do?",
  "42952": "And if the vote be really no infallible talisman for man, why should we expect it to work magical wonders in the hands of woman?",
  "42953": "Ay, is it not?",
  "42954": "Who will lend his cape?",
  "42955": "It should be larceny, I'm thinking?",
  "42956": "Would you go with them?",
  "42957": "Why not?",
  "42958": "How did you manage to get here?",
  "42959": "What are your special sins?",
  "42960": "What's this they tell me?",
  "42961": "Do you say that I am false to you?",
  "42962": "She could not surely still love that other man who had treated her with such vile falsehood?",
  "42963": "Will you bet three to one he is not found guilty?",
  "42964": "Were you stopped?",
  "42965": "Had the twenty years of war worn out the blade as it had worn the scabbard, the soul as well as the body?",
  "42966": "What say you?",
  "42967": "And leave the person to whom one gives the thing, you mean, to discover it?",
  "42968": "In what state was the house when you left?",
  "42969": "Would that make the navigation better or worse?",
  "42970": "Can't I talk with you any more?",
  "42971": "Electricity?",
  "42972": "For, in short, if it were not he, who could it be?",
  "42973": "Do you know him, then?",
  "42974": "If all our institutions are based upon an error in calculation, does it not follow that these institutions are so many shams?",
  "42975": "And how are you, my dear boy?",
  "42976": "Oh, what can I say?",
  "42977": "But is the old min agreeable?",
  "42978": "Does the author promise a second part at all?",
  "42979": "What was it we were talking about?",
  "42980": "And who is to pay him?",
  "42981": "Can you stand?",
  "42982": "Shall I assume that we ourselves are able and experienced judges and have before now met with such a person?",
  "42983": "Will you hazard so desperate a step while there is any possibility that any portion of the ills you fly from have no real existence?",
  "42984": "Isn't it rather dangerous, the way you drive?",
  "42985": "MUST a name mean something?",
  "42986": "What will your mother say?",
  "42987": "Are you a ghost?",
  "42988": "He is greatly changed?",
  "42989": "Mary, do you remember the last time that we were together?",
  "42990": "Was it not you who spoke to me about a certain young man?",
  "42991": "So now, what's to be done?",
  "42992": "But with what shall I reward him?",
  "42993": "Pretty well swelled out, an't he?",
  "42994": "Take it out?",
  "42995": "And how many were there of these linen drapers?",
  "42996": "But will you allow me for one minute to take my supposition for granted?",
  "42997": "How, then?",
  "42998": "And have you not been to bed?",
  "42999": "But what did you do while it was raining?",
  "43000": "And, when the ghost speaks to you, what does he say?",
  "43001": "Pedringano?",
  "43002": "Kept her, on that sweet construction, to be his mistress?",
  "43003": "Did you steal into my confidence, and with scoffing mouth spy out the secrets of my heart, in order to go away and betray them to your paramour?",
  "43004": "Shall I knock?",
  "43005": "A barrowful of WHAT?",
  "43006": "Who is so wise as to have perfect knowledge of all things?",
  "43007": "But what's the matter?",
  "43008": "Perhaps for another reason?",
  "43009": "Are we quite alone, monsieur?",
  "43010": "Ain't they got any necks, then?",
  "43011": "How do you go to work?",
  "43012": "But what has she done?",
  "43013": "A chair?",
  "43014": "Not a first attempt, I take it?",
  "43015": "Go with you, is it?",
  "43016": "Ah, what IS it, now?",
  "43017": "If you're not then, where's your faith?",
  "43018": "Does that suggest anything to you?",
  "43019": "In what?",
  "43020": "Can't ye stay just the same?",
  "43021": "Worked in the yards before?",
  "43022": "Shall I not read now?",
  "43023": "And if once there has been love, if they have been married for love, why should love pass away?",
  "43024": "Why are you so gay, fellow?",
  "43025": "But you do not yourself look upon this as likely?",
  "43026": "Whether she be living?",
  "43027": "They won't take him?",
  "43028": "What possible use is he now?",
  "43029": "Was he afraid of measuring swords with this trained detective?",
  "43030": "Well, and what harm is there in that?",
  "43031": "Not that, either?",
  "43032": "Trow?",
  "43033": "Who was the soundest of their logicians?",
  "43034": "Your mother, then, is quite well?",
  "43035": "Does it take so much time?",
  "43036": "What foolery is this?",
  "43037": "Went very well, did he?",
  "43038": "Why was he kneeling there like a child saying his evening prayers?",
  "43039": "But why did you come, and do this wrong thing, after doing such a right thing as you have done?",
  "43040": "And what do you think about father?",
  "43041": "But what do you expect?",
  "43042": "But why does anybody care about him?",
  "43043": "What do you fear?",
  "43044": "In the first place, you will sup with me, will you not?",
  "43045": "Was he aware, in short, that the entire motions of the terrestrial sphere had undergone a complete modification?",
  "43046": "Wouldn't you have a master for your castle in the air?",
  "43047": "But could anyone possibly eat sixty monks?",
  "43048": "How can I decide?",
  "43049": "Is the king pleased?",
  "43050": "Can you, sir, produce any witnesses to the truth of what you have asserted?",
  "43051": "Did they really?",
  "43052": "What are you saying?",
  "43053": "Do you know the consequence of this recall to me, my old darling?",
  "43054": "Need I ask again whether the eye has an end?",
  "43055": "What was I?",
  "43056": "And why did you show so much joy in reading it?",
  "43057": "Will your worships give me leave to squeeze in a story between these two pages?",

  "43830": "Did you give the letter?",
  "43831": "I suppose you have not heard that one young man levanted last year to save himself from a breach of promise case?",
  "43832": "Well, are we going for the children?",
  "43833": "Is that all?",
  "43834": "Didn't I tell you?",
  "43835": "But who was present?",
  "43836": "Under a pretext of luxury would you like to establish new classes of citizens?",
  "43837": "What else have I that I can think of?",

  "43852": "Oh, that's the trouble is it?",
  "43853": "Has she heard?",
  "43854": "Why do you wish to know?",
  "43855": "Could he not squeeze under the seat of a carriage?",
  "43856": "Or what does he know about anything for that matter?",

  "43912": "Has he ever whaled it any?",
  "43913": "Will master permit me to make a recommendation?",
  "43914": "And, more especially, can he pass unfriendly legislation to violate his oath?",

  "43926": "How well are the machine sheds at the barracks guarded?",
  "43927": "What d'ye say?",
  "43928": "Had you had a row?",
  "43929": "What has it all been about?",
  "43930": "Why did you not darken your light, that he might be stricken with horror at his crime?",
  "43931": "After this?",
  "43932": "Before the boy comes?",
  "43933": "But why need I wear spectacles?",
  "43934": "Where then do you mean to take refuge?",
  "43935": "What are you going to do with him, assuming that you've got him?",
  "43936": "You'll show it to the master?",
  "43937": "But why shouldn't I say I saw something?",
  "43938": "After a pause of several minutes, their silence was broken, by his asking her in a voice of some agitation, when he was to congratulate her on the acquisition of a brother?",
  "43939": "And what did you say to her?",
  "43940": "Hain't you eyes?",
  "43941": "Why mine?",
  "43942": "Did no one examine?",
  "43943": "Would that be right?",

  "43947": "Whither should I go?",
  "43948": "Now tell I tell you something?",
  "43949": "Whose voice was that?",
  "43950": "What will happen, then?",
  "43951": "Did he give his name?",
  "43952": "And where is the consulate?",
  "43953": "Why does he let things be so?",
  "43954": "Singly?",
  "43955": "Mary what, then?",
  "43956": "Are you going?",
  "43957": "Thy breast employ?",
  "43958": "I suppose you were a gentleman, then, as well as now?",
  "43959": "Will you be pleased to hang me?",
  "43960": "Am I not thy brother?",
  "43961": "Camp in a bog, would you?",
  "43962": "Ah what's this I smell?",
  "43963": "And why am I disturbed, for the dispersion of my elements will happen whatever I do?",
  "43964": "Do you doubt it?",
  "43965": "But why not, my dear?",
  "43966": "But how did he account for it?",
  "43967": "Danae means a shower of gold, does it not?",
  "43968": "And in that case they will be right in doing good to the evil and evil to the good?",
  "43969": "Would I reflect on the price?",

  "43974": "How long ago?",
  "43975": "What pickpockets are they who ply their trade in the rear of glory?",
  "43976": "Will not the three men be found?",
  "43977": "What are they doin' THERE, for gracious sakes?",
  "43978": "How is it that that name rises upon all occasions to torment my ears, during the last two or three days?",
  "43979": "Or maybe it is that monsieur does not care to hunt marauders?",
  "43980": "To keep her in?",
  "43981": "And what do you?",
  "43982": "First, you are sorry for what you've done, and you see the folly of it all?",
  "43983": "Are they or their descendants to embrace our faith?",
  "43984": "Where is the church?",
  "43985": "Nor by reason of a knowledge which advises about brazen pots, I said, nor as possessing any other similar knowledge?",
  "43986": "Who shall judge of the continuance of the danger?",
  "43987": "Are you sure we are alone?",
  "43988": "Are you quite sure that this is a man, or that he has ever been one?",
  "43989": "Who said it?",
  "43990": "The queen wears the rosette?",
  "43991": "To give him an opportunity or making some of his severe remarks and moral reflections, and to undo what we had so much trouble in effecting?",

  "44001": "The thing was proven upon him?",
  "44002": "Do you feel rather easier?",
  "44003": "Where are the matches?",
  "44004": "Then, for all your valour, you would save your life?",
  "44005": "Guilty of what?",
  "44006": "Why, is any day old and new?",
  "44007": "Why that day did I to watch give o'er?",

  "45003": "Have you no present interest in any of the company who occupy the sofas and chairs before you?",
  "45004": "What is the lowest you will take for him?",
  "45005": "And why expose his own children in the battle?",
  "45006": "Look here, young man, are you sure you've no idea where your sister is?",
  "45007": "Are there lights in the windows?",
  "45008": "So you've been here a whole hour?",
  "45009": "Now, follow that passage with your eye, and tell me whether it distinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that he was instructed by his legal advisers wholly to reserve his defence?",
  "45010": "How could I live an alien in that house where I had been the child?",
  "45011": "Shall you stay there?",
  "45012": "Who has not heard of the hardest drinker in all the army?",
  "45013": "Wasn't he fed, poor thing?",
  "45014": "Would it be kindness?",
  "45015": "And how shall we manage the period between birth and education, which seems to require the greatest care?",
  "45016": "How do you know she has?",
  "45017": "It was running wild after the girls may be?",
  "45018": "He sent some one?",
  "45019": "Who would know so well as you how to teach the lesson of endurance to others?",
  "45020": "Did I not think so?",
  "45021": "By making them stronger for each other's aid, will you make her less willing to discharge a lighter than a greater responsibility?",
  "45022": "But when your father comes back tomorrow what am I to tell him?",
  "45023": "Oh, do you then know him?",
  "45024": "And you think it quite right?",
  "45025": "Then, again, within the city, how will they exchange their productions?",
  "45026": "Believe what?",
  "45027": "Now, my boy, which house is it?",
  "45028": "Perhaps, concerned only for his imminent doom, he had not had sincere sorrow for his sin?",
  "45029": "How can we help?",
  "45030": "How could a man like him be expected to have any pleasure in such a discovery?",
  "45031": "So it was YOUR cry of distress that I heard?",
  "45032": "But do you suppose that if I had been I should have asked you to let me go and live with him?",
  "45033": "Are you coming?",
  "45034": "You think you're better'n your father, now, don't you, because he can't?",
  "45035": "Is it strife?",
  "45036": "What needs he the defence this arm can make?",
  "45037": "Do I understand it?",
  "45038": "What about the general?",
  "45039": "Your brother was, I believe, unmarried, was he not?",
  "45040": "Why didn't I enter the room?",
  "45041": "What will the archbishop think of that?",
  "45042": "Less pedigree?",
  "45043": "The young fellow whose arms you held, don't you know?",
  "45044": "What was then to be done?",
  "45045": "Why did not you all learn?",
  "45046": "Does it apply well to my suit?",
  "45047": "You mean my mother?",
  "45048": "What does he think I can do with his five francs?",
  "45049": "What lunacy are you talking?",
  "45050": "How could he hope ever to grow up to be as good and wise as they, or even tolerably good and wise?",
  "45051": "Lie down?",
  "45052": "Why not, my love?",
  "45053": "More smart, is it?",
  "45054": "Can it be with me?",
  "45055": "Lord?",
  "45056": "What is the matter with you that you know them?",
  "45057": "What does he mean by using a shotgun when silence was his one chance of escape?",
  "45058": "Is the time ripe now?",
  "45059": "What will be our future condition if he should beget other suns?",
  "45060": "But why are we standing here?",
  "45061": "But who knows, madam, but somebody that shall be nameless would like me best with all my little finery about me?",
  "45062": "How dare you to insinuate that you don't know my character better than your words imply?",
  "45063": "Why had he wasted his time hunting?",
  "45064": "In the hat?",
  "45065": "What is there in your mind?",
  "45066": "You really love, then, no lady at this court?",
  "45067": "Will she be safe over there?",
  "45068": "Why shouldn't we make one fireside of it, and marry each other?",
  "45069": "Have you a mind to teach the beavers to sing?",
  "45070": "Why was this?",
  "45071": "What have you got to say next?",
  "45072": "How soon can he be here?",
  "45073": "Now, what DO you want to buy?",
  "45074": "How you come to fall out?",
  "45075": "Will he come again?",
  "45076": "You're a determined little miss, aren't you?",
  "45077": "Where have you put it?",
  "45078": "Can you provide that they shall be separated at bed and board?",
  "45079": "Did anything happen this time?",
  "45080": "Where does my father get all that iron rust from?",
  "45081": "And you choose that time for grazing?",
  "45082": "Fifteen shillings a week not much, young man?",
  "45083": "If I could do that, simpleton, where would the danger be?",
  "45084": "A natural death is better than an artificial life, surely?",
  "45085": "Children dear, were we long alone?",
  "45086": "Is this number seven?",
  "45087": "Why do you suppose that I should look severely on your affection for that young man?",
  "45088": "Is this a weather to send benevolence?",
  "45089": "Who was the criminal, then?",
  "45090": "And what reason is that?",
  "45091": "Where was the difficulty?",
  "45092": "What do I care about blood?",
  "45093": "What is that stupid fellow troubling himself about?",
  "45094": "You say I can't live but a few hours?",
  "45095": "Is this a preparation for immortality?",
  "45096": "Had I ever seen so much loathing and pale horror on one countenance?",
  "45097": "When shall we start?",
  "45098": "Did I, sir?",
  "45099": "And who can tell when these happy hours may return?",
  "45100": "Don't you remember you and I had it when we were fixing the pipes outside the projectile, when we had the other breakdown?",
  "45101": "We were saying that the parents should be in the prime of life?",
  "45102": "Are these no capital?",
  "45103": "A little of the wine?",
  "45104": "Why did I at once experience a shock?",
  "45105": "Cannot I cut off the part and restore you by a sweat bath?",
  "45106": "Should art be taken seriously?",
  "45107": "But how are you to get that balance?",
  "45108": "Why this hostility of interests?",
  "45109": "What availed the noise and bustle of cheerful morning, which penetrated even there, to him?",
  "45110": "Have we not tramps and beggars enough already to pester us as we sit at meat?",
  "45111": "When shall it be?",
  "45112": "Can you turn a strain to the ladies, sir?",
  "45113": "Over whom?",
  "45114": "Didn't he ask you why you didn't bring him the papers?",
  "45115": "Would not jets of boiling water, constantly injected by the pumps, raise the temperature in this part and stay the congelation?",
  "45116": "What difference would that make?",
  "45117": "Or look you I should play the orator?",
  "45118": "Doth not wealth satiate, and become nauseous, and no longer serve to satisfy or pleasure, or to buy an hour's peace of mind?",
  "45119": "And did you do anything?",
  "45120": "You wouldn't let any enemy hurt me, if you could prevent it?",
  "45121": "You were going to say, thirdly?",
  "45122": "Do they really, you dog?",
  "45123": "Into a new light?",
  "45124": "Did she want to stay at home?",
  "45125": "Which building?",
  "45126": "But why should I consort, I, a brave man, with the abominable?",
  "45127": "Can you guess, now, what this is?",
  "45128": "Suppose you were a foundling and were shown our faith and yours, and asked for which you would decide, which would you choose?",
  "45129": "And how on earth would she ever manage to hold her tongue during school hours?",
  "45130": "Are we afraid of foreign gold?",
  "45131": "Was it a double tooth, hey?",
  "45132": "And how can it all be done by daybreak?",
  "45133": "After these, what resentment can remain in the heart?",
  "45134": "But if she has so absolutely failed, what then had she done?",
  "45135": "And you remember, too, the period when he began to grow fatter?",
  "45136": "I said likely we wouldn't, because I had heard say there warn't but about a dozen houses there, and if they didn't happen to have them lit up, how was we going to know we was passing a town?",
  "45137": "What is nature?",
  "45138": "What was it that was borne in upon my mind when she stood still and looked attentively at me?",
  "45139": "And you're not frightened?",
  "45140": "Are you a politician, friend?",
  "45141": "Have you not got all the plants and stones you want?",
  "45142": "What time was it?",
  "45143": "Is it obeying your husband to disobey him on the wital subject of his business?",
  "45144": "On what grounds?",
  "45145": "What is your address in the country?",
  "45146": "How will he ever know the truth, since I shall not tell him of it?",
  "45147": "It was he who rescued you?",
  "45148": "What de devil you here for, den?",
  "45149": "What, for instance, do you mean by all that humbug about the soul?",
  "45150": "Cannot I answer your purpose?",
  "45151": "Natasha, it's magical, isn't it?",
  "45152": "To whom did he give up his sword?",
  "45153": "Would not that be a sacrifice of higher prospects for you?",
  "45154": "An't you?",
  "45155": "Say, what can cause such impotence of mind?",
  "45156": "But the doctor?",
  "45157": "What business have I with this pipe?",
  "45158": "You have a recipe for it?",
  "45159": "Hang the boy, can't I never learn anything?",
  "45160": "But she?",
  "45161": "Do you know anything about fortifications?",
  "45162": "Is there no merit in repentance?",
  "45163": "What became of you, dear?",
  "45164": "Well, what is to be done, mademoiselle, when so many wills are leagued against me?",
  "45165": "And besides, what is truth to us but the continuous progress of our mind from poetry to prose?",
  "45166": "Is there any point to which you would wish to draw my attention?",
  "45167": "Shall we go in?",
  "45168": "And how would I do it, think you?",
  "45169": "At least we can have a window?",
  "45170": "It was somewhere here?",
  "45171": "Must one die like a dog?",
  "45172": "What does that wagon contain?",
  "45173": "What's the matter with your leg?",
  "45174": "Might not some curious eye fasten on it, and divine its contents?",
  "45175": "What is the difference?",
  "45176": "Who's the other fool?",
  "45177": "Well, do you understand, monsieur?",
  "45178": "You are doing catkins?",
  "45179": "Now, how does a man search a revolving bookcase?",
  "45180": "On what ground do you venture to interfere with me, messieurs?",
  "45181": "What ails ye, man?",
  "45182": "What would be your surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness?",
  "45183": "If you're not coming yourself, give us the cards, will you?",
  "45184": "In the office?",
  "45185": "Ah, precious one, why does your lover live to see you dead?",
  "45186": "Could she be deceived as to the meaning of this?",
  "45187": "Do you really mean to say that that leg of yours is better already?",
  "45188": "Do you not think perhaps that some of the shortcoming lies with yourself?",
  "45189": "Her name?",
  "45190": "How can that be, monsieur?",
  "45191": "What duties?",
  "45192": "And suppose he can obtain his desires, is that so bad as cutting her throat?",
  "45193": "Look here, do you intend to take up you abode with us?",
  "45194": "What do you want to drink now?",
  "45195": "Carey?",
  "45196": "Happy?",
  "45197": "How old are you?",
  "45198": "Is it such as they that we are to follow?",
  "45199": "Do you not think that I also long for forgetfulness?",
  "45200": "What's this?",
  "45201": "What is the captain about?",
  "45202": "Cannot you tell him I will?",
  "45203": "Now, couldn't you swear she was going to get up in a minute?",
  "45204": "Why had he not let them know that he was still working on the case?",
  "45205": "A ghost?",
  "45206": "Will you work?",
  "45207": "Where have you been, this long, long while?",
  "45208": "What might not have happened to men?",
  "45209": "With what color of propriety could the force necessary for defense be limited by those who cannot limit the force of offense?",
  "45210": "Is it bright?",
  "45211": "How could I know he hated him?",
  "45212": "But didn't she say all about it?",
  "45213": "And all this, for what, I pray?",
  "45214": "Who told you that I loved him?",
  "45215": "Is that what you meant?",
  "45216": "And did I do it for my country's sake?",
  "45217": "Why did you get married?",
  "45218": "But what exactly am I to tell you about them?",
  "45219": "Now where will it be agreeable to you that we hold our conference?",
  "45220": "Why does fate play such tricks with poor, helpless worms?",
  "45221": "Have you ever seen a snake rise up on your path?",
  "45222": "Do passive indolent women make the best wives?",
  "45223": "What would you feel, if a man were faithless to you?",
  "45224": "Has a dog money?",
  "45225": "What do you want there?",
  "45226": "Eliza, girl, what ails you today?",
  "45227": "What is there for me to eat this evening?",
  "45228": "Is there fate amongst us still, send down from the pagan world of old, that such things must be, and in such way?",
  "45229": "Then you had some grounds for supposing he might be the culprit?",
  "45230": "How on earth did you manage to become the favorite of the king, you who have never spoken to him more than twice in your life?",
  "45231": "And your second wish?",
  "45232": "If the view from below had been most interesting and singular, how shall I describe its appearance as seen from above?",
  "45233": "What do you think of a brilliant display of fireworks?",
  "45234": "Are you cold?",
  "45235": "Not so dusty, what?",
  "45236": "Till death itself?",
  "45237": "To defend him would be to accuse herself, would it not?",
  "45238": "But do you think it will rise?",
  "45239": "As bad as all that?",
  "45240": "May it not be spoken except in private?",
  "45241": "For the story?",
  "45242": "But not as a CELEBRITY?",
  "45243": "Is it possible that you do not know that comparisons of wit with wit, valour with valour, beauty with beauty, birth with birth, are always odious and unwelcome?",
  "45244": "When did you first begin this mad career?",
  "45245": "May he share your hopes?",
  "45246": "Would she so?",
  "45247": "Do you place it out at interest?",
  "45248": "I suppose that's why you never got married, uncle?",
  "45249": "But do you know why he did not come, papa?",
  "45250": "Then he is on board?",
  "45251": "Do you find the study of the lower orders interesting?",
  "45252": "Can you make any objection?",
  "45253": "It is quite decided, then?",
  "45254": "What shall I pay you for the body?",
  "45255": "Would he not rather say or do the same as his like in the same case?",
  "45256": "Stryver?",
  "45257": "But how do you and your neighbour get on about the disputed right of way?",
  "45258": "It is possible we may meet again,' and 'will it be of any consequence to you whether we do or not?",
  "45259": "Would he have to abdicate his precentorship, as he had his wardenship, and to give up chanting, as he had given up his twelve old bedesmen?",
  "45260": "What is he waiting for?",
  "45261": "Do you remember that's what you used to call them?",
  "45262": "And where is coldness so ugly as between brothers?",
  "45263": "You know you let me call you so?",
  "45264": "Where is he, then?",
  "45265": "Does the cardinal refuse to receive the king?",
  "45266": "Theurgy, magic, and sorcery?",
  "45267": "What can have happened to them all this time?",
  "45268": "What did you talk about?",
  "45269": "Why on earth do you say that?",
  "45270": "Do you know why it's called a whiting?",
  "45271": "Eyebrows?",
  "45272": "Could I forget them?",
  "45273": "Number and date taken, I suppose?",
  "45274": "Have I not borne secrets heavier than this?",
  "45275": "But, then, accidents?",
  "45276": "Do you think it would be any harm?",
  "45277": "Why not add to the first class the pachydermatous indifference to rebuffs which is of such service to the social climber, and, to the second, taste in dress and the habit of not repeating stories?",
  "45278": "Conrad, what is it?",
  "45279": "Is there nobody here who can sing a song to lighten the time?",
  "45280": "Bless me, how shall I behave?",
  "45281": "What harm can I do to you or to her?",
  "45282": "On me, uncle?",
  "45283": "Somebody has stolen a rabbit?",
  "45284": "Why enter into painful details, so easily divined by the intelligent reader?",
  "45285": "How do you come here?",
  "45286": "Does any answer come out of it?",
  "45287": "How can he find out his strength or weakness otherwise?",
  "45288": "Who's talking o' women?",
  "45289": "Have you never made others labor?",
  "45290": "Ist I will be reueng'd?",
  "45291": "Does he give you sharp answers?",
  "45292": "Do we want to contemplate his mercy?",
  "45293": "What is your theory, then, as to those footmarks?",
  "45294": "And how did you find out?",
  "45295": "Are your things sent off?",
  "45296": "Why did they fancy you?",
  "45297": "Will that suit you?",
  "45298": "Feel what, squire?",
  "45299": "So, then, am I her enemy?",
  "45300": "Saturday?",
  "45301": "How do you keep it on?",
  "45302": "Then why don't they give it up?",
  "45303": "Well, what if there is a trial?",
  "45304": "What are you yourself seeking?",
  "45305": "Would I be quiet and talk rationally?",
  "45306": "Well, what can you do?",
  "45307": "But what would grammar matter if he really loved her?",
  "45308": "Has he marked himself?",
  "45309": "I ask by whose authority?",
  "45310": "Master bridegroom, where are you?",
  "45311": "Why need he bother about my tuft?",
  "45312": "Farfrae's?",
  "45313": "Are you turning up your noses?",
  "45314": "What then remained?",
  "45315": "You're getting too proud to own me afore company, are you?",
  "45316": "Your father was fortunate, then?",
  "45317": "Do you really believe that such is our aim?",
  "45318": "Could he, as he asked, stop the sea with his hands?",
  "45319": "Do you suppose THEY don't know, sir?",
  "45320": "What has she done?",
  "45321": "I've fretted my gizzard green about it, maister, but what can I do?",
  "45322": "Could it be possible that even now a remnant of that lost race inhabited the ruined grandeur that had once been their progenitor?",
  "45323": "Quite for ever?",
  "45324": "Why do you keep tramping up and down like an old hen?",
  "45325": "Is it ketching?",
  "45326": "Your opinion, if you please, on this difficult matter?",
  "45327": "As her husband was a man of means, and had doubtless returned by this time, could she not send them the money?",
  "45328": "And dark?",
  "45329": "What name would your friend like to put on it?",
  "45330": "What are you going to tell me?",
  "45331": "Aren't they laughing at me?",
  "45332": "And if you wished to die, you would choose this death, count?",
  "45333": "You hain't seen no towhead?",
  "45334": "Do you think I don't repent?",
  "45335": "What are you doing out of your studio at this hour?",
  "45336": "Is love the only thing?",
  "45337": "Oh, you didn't?",
  "45338": "For that only?",
  "45339": "And I hope you're good children, are you?",
  "45340": "How was it that no one else saw it?",
  "45341": "In our own house?",
  "45342": "Cannot you inform him that it is frightful earnest?",
  "45343": "Well, what shall we do?",
  "45344": "Why shouldn't it be?",
  "45345": "Well, then, are you the brave captain, are you the valiant blade who dispersed those who wished to burn the condemned?",
  "45346": "Will you please look into the case and restore the old man to his home if the public interest will admit?",
  "45347": "Why should we not imagine this the apartment of an honest mother?",
  "45348": "No bid?",
  "45349": "He comes to live with us?",
  "45350": "Have they come from the town?",
  "45351": "But who told you I was inactive?",
  "45352": "Can you remember any breakfast that I've had today?",
  "45353": "And what are they, captain?",
  "45354": "Well, what of it?",
  "45355": "What am I to do?",
  "45356": "Why did you leave there?",
  "45357": "What can you suppose?",
  "45358": "What drawer or tiring do you mean?",
  "45359": "Don't you ever go on an excursion?",
  "45360": "Did he say whether he had any business to speak about?",
  "45361": "Are you 'fraid of bubbles, too?",
  "45362": "I hope you have preserved the unities, sir?",
  "45363": "Martha knew about you all the time?",
  "45364": "Why did you paint him?",
  "45365": "How could you say that its relation to a knower is the only and fundamental relation for the existence of the tree?",
  "45366": "And you say in his leisure moments the worthy man was a poacher?",
  "45367": "Come, who is this man who is in the basket?",
  "45368": "You don't happen to know of any other that would be at liberty?",
  "45369": "Because I like his company?",
  "45370": "How many desperate wretches have I sent to the devil?",
  "45371": "You've got them at last?",
  "45372": "Is there no morsel bread that ye do keep?",
  "45373": "Then why so hurry me?",
  "45374": "Why do you grovel before it?",
  "45375": "Aren't men silly?",
  "45376": "Is it all a quite dead garden?",
  "45377": "Now, do you know what all this means?",
  "45378": "What are the chief sources of expense in every government?",
  "45379": "Can nothing save him?",
  "45380": "You know his guilt?",
  "45381": "What was that miracle?",
  "45382": "And what may you have to say to him?",
  "45383": "Oh, madam, let me bring you a little something?",
  "45384": "Well, now, what are your conditions, if I employ you?",
  "45385": "You have as good as informed me, sir, that you are going shortly to be married?",
  "45386": "Oh, where is there deliverance from the flux of things and from the 'existence' of penalty?",
  "45387": "Do you think he wants to die?",
  "45388": "Wheres thy lady?",
  "45389": "You don't mind my fumigating you?",
  "45390": "The only question was, had she ten or twelve?",
  "45391": "What faces are the most distinct to me in the fleeting crowd?",
  "45392": "What should you prefer?",
  "45393": "Why not, if it amuses him?",
  "45394": "Didn't anybody ever tell you?",
  "45395": "And pray, where do you consider modern music to begin?",
  "45396": "Why do we hate?",
  "45397": "And if she cast it aside, her loyalty, her promise?",
  "45398": "A prisoner?",
  "45399": "But, even relying on his good faith, would be he able to keep his promise?",
  "45400": "Haow soon?",
  "45401": "But what can I do?",
  "45402": "Where th' blazes does he git his stren'th from?",
  "45403": "You cannot say what it was?",
  "45404": "And the walks in the avenues?",
  "45405": "Who shall reveal the burning anxiety with which he throbbed to see beyond that cruel wall?",
  "45406": "What will he do?",
  "45407": "To whom shall I give the list of the children's linen?",
  "45408": "What have you said, but that I am to stay a fortnight longer?",
  "45409": "What do you think of a bite of a mouth like that?",
  "45410": "Shall I rise, madam, and pay my duty to my new aunt?",
  "45411": "Emp'ror?",
  "45412": "What other course could it pursue?",
  "45413": "Where's my ulster?",
  "45414": "What to do next?",
  "45415": "Dreadful apparition, why do you trouble me?",
  "45416": "Is she also taken away from me for ever?",
  "45417": "Would not the general loss be too great to justify such relief?",
  "45418": "How many did you get?",
  "45419": "But you like me in spite of it?",
  "45420": "Have you come from a great distance?",
  "45421": "What right have we to argue?",
  "45422": "Have you ever been there?",
  "45423": "With the king's command?",
  "45424": "And is she possessed with a devil?",
  "45425": "Upon what is opinion settled?",
  "45426": "Was it an accident?",
  "45427": "What is the good of all this romancing?",
  "45428": "Why on earth not?",
  "45429": "Montmartre?",
  "45430": "Hedn't you 'baout's well send the old man aboard?",
  "45431": "What occasions?",
  "45432": "Know not the living that the grave will swallow them up after a life of sadness and cruel misery?",
  "45433": "So, with the springtime, what was more likely than that the wild idea of escaping had come to him?",
  "45434": "He stopped hard by me, and asked if I knew who he was?",
  "45435": "What could be inside it?",
  "45436": "She is your daughter?",
  "45437": "Where could it a come from?",
  "45438": "A murderous attack?",
  "45439": "Has this place any local appellation?",
  "45440": "Shall I strike it, sir?",
  "45441": "Why do you talk to me like this?",
  "45442": "What can he do here?",
  "45443": "You're not racing?",
  "45444": "Shall it lie unproductive in the public vaults?",
  "45445": "What are you looking at now?",
  "45446": "Why went he there?",
  "45447": "Oh, is that all?",
  "45448": "Or is this not true, is there no such thing as pure accident?",
  "45449": "Alas, who shall now comfort the good margrave's wife?",
  "45450": "That book is quite closed?",
  "45451": "What do you expect me to say?",
  "45452": "Am I?",
  "45453": "Are you happy?",
  "45454": "Why all this coldness, O my best beloved?",
  "45455": "Well, but where have you left the ladies?",
  "45456": "Have you come to meet me?",
  "45457": "And suppose that they were to attack the upper part of the balloon, what would you do?",
  "45458": "May I beg your pardon again, if I inquire what you mean, sir?",
  "45459": "Leave?",
  "45460": "Ever, as long as you live?",
  "45461": "Was ever such an account of a dynasty given?",
  "45462": "Don't you think it's pretty rough not to let her go to the picnic when she's so set on it?",
  "45463": "Is the cloth taken?",
  "45464": "Adam?",
  "45465": "How did you receive that wound on your face?",
  "45466": "But what did you do yesterday after you left me?",
  "45467": "And the harmonious soul is both temperate and courageous?",
  "45468": "Now, how should I, that ne'er have squealed in your sty, know all the swine therein?",
  "45469": "But won't that mar the charming effect of my consistent shabbiness?",
  "45470": "And what do you suppose it's made of?",
  "45471": "I wonder what's become of her?",
  "45472": "O see na ye yon bonny bower?",
  "45473": "Would you have your husband constantly at your feet?",
  "45474": "Where shall you be yourself?",
  "45475": "Are not the young people growing up today, really dead before they have a chance to live?",
  "45476": "How many times have I told you to tell me at once?",
  "45477": "Is not that so?",
  "45478": "Is it more afflicting to him to leave the graves of his fathers than it is to our brothers and children?",
  "45479": "Do you think it is nonsense?",
  "45480": "And what of passion, or spirit?",
  "45481": "And will you punish him because he cannot become so?",
  "45482": "To you alone, then, may I confide my sorrows and my hopes?",
  "45483": "Then don't you like them?",
  "45484": "Now, what do you complain of?",
  "45485": "Shall I be believed?",
  "45486": "Well, and what good would that be?",
  "45487": "How do you propose to deal with the case, sir?",
  "45488": "AIN' dat gay?",
  "45489": "It was you, then, that hit me?",
  "45490": "Who is this?",
  "45491": "What amount is wanting?",
  "45492": "Do all your people grow on bushes?",
  "45493": "Were all the infinitely numerous kinds of animals and plants created as eggs or seed, or as full grown?",
  "45494": "And what is one?",
  "45495": "What the deuce are you driving at now?",
  "45496": "To some old hag?",
  "45497": "Who's he?",
  "45498": "Did she?",
  "45499": "Do you think he'll give us a good ride?",
  "45500": "Then how used you it?",
  "45501": "Shall it be the bride or bridegroom?",
  "45502": "Will he be poison'd with a simile?",
  "45503": "Where are we going to now?",
  "45504": "What, CAPITAL?",
  "45505": "But how shall I leave him dreeft?",
  "45506": "Was she, indeed?",
  "45507": "What am I to do, then?",
  "45508": "Why don't you put a heap of stones there and pretend it is a rockery?",
  "45509": "Amicable?",
  "45510": "Oh, why did I not tell you all?",
  "45511": "How, if that be so?",
  "45512": "That she ought to go back?",
  "45513": "Don't you want to be good?",
  "45514": "Possible, my dear?",
  "45515": "Do you want to fight it?",
  "45516": "Have you anything further to say about your friend?",
  "45517": "You are crying, aren't you?",
  "45518": "But what know they more than we ?",
  "45519": "Why do artists, like mechanics, find the means to live?",
  "45520": "Can this be another vengeance of that woman?",
  "45521": "What did he want?",
  "45522": "My new blue coat as I've got on?",
  "45523": "Are you satisfied?",
  "45524": "Was ever such bad luck and such bad management, too?",
  "45525": "What is the fact?",
  "45526": "Wouldn't you like the flower table?",
  "45527": "It isn't one of your jokes, is it?",
  "45528": "Where's that huntsman from?",
  "45529": "Why should he leave the comet?",
  "45530": "You don't care much for oysters, do you?",
  "45531": "But why doesn't the duke come in?",
  "45532": "Would he be in soon?",
  "45533": "Is it her mother you're going to take her to?",
  "45534": "Whatever shall I do?",
  "45535": "What can be the signification of the uneven shrugging of her hulchy shoulders?",
  "45536": "Where is a man's resource and what can he do?",
  "45537": "And had he not moved her?",
  "45538": "But are they fully known?",
  "45539": "Secondly, what will satisfy you for the trouble of producing it?",
  "45540": "My dear cousin, can you be satisfied with such a way of spending your probation?",
  "45541": "D'you want to wash?",
  "45542": "Why, what nonsense are you telling us?",
  "45543": "Do you seek any promise from me?",
  "45544": "Or is he dead?",
  "45545": "Parry, is that all?",
  "45546": "Can't we save?",
  "45547": "What were they about?",
  "45548": "Only a bullet?",
  "45549": "And now that she did own it, what should be her course?",
  "45550": "Now, if competition cannot by itself become the common condition, why should not those for whom it offers nothing but perils, exact guarantees from the barons whom they serve?",
  "45551": "Would its citizens approve of its doing so?",
  "45552": "These relics have a history then?",
  "45553": "This screaming mob, are they, or are they not, my subjects?",
  "45554": "Would it be much out of the way, to take me in, near the great cathedral door between the two towers?",
  "45555": "But how came you to tell me that he was so disagreeable?",
  "45556": "And how did you regulate the matter, let me know?",
  "45557": "Why have you gone out of your mind, like this?",
  "45558": "We may venture on a contest with them, may we not?",
  "45559": "And not talebearers either?",
  "45560": "Is she like him?",
  "45561": "Commission?",
  "45562": "How has he deserved this persecution?",
  "45563": "You will not communicate your letter to me?",
  "45564": "Where the devil can all the shipping be?",
  "45565": "What do you think of that letter?",
  "45566": "What did they say, then, of the disappearance of these gems?",
  "45567": "Everybody?",
  "45568": "Are there many?",
  "45569": "Does preparation advance at all?",
  "45570": "Haven't you just told me all about it?",
  "45571": "Look, did not this stump come from thy shop?",
  "45572": "What have any of you cussed cattle to do with thinking what's right?",
  "45573": "Was it really, was it really necessary to have so fresh and young a face, a forehead so shy and always ready to cover itself with the pink blush of modesty in order to pass in the lonely night, in a carriage and pair, accompanied by a mysterious lover?",
  "45574": "Where's the servant whose business it is to answer the door?",
  "45575": "Have they demolished it stone by stone, and uprooted the soil to the last tree?",
  "45576": "What is it about the sight of sheep that excites one so?",
  "45577": "Well, and what are you doing?",
  "45578": "I say, laddie, would you mind getting me a lemonade?",
  "45579": "Was that affair hot?",
  "45580": "What shall we do for music?",
  "45581": "What is the matter?",
  "45582": "Cosa volete?",
  "45583": "What is the gentlewoman?",
  "45584": "Is it not his duty to tell the truth, and nothing but the truth, in order that his subject may stand out unobstructed and shine forth unclouded?",
  "45585": "Were you asked?",
  "45586": "Where is your shelter?",
  "45587": "And what did the officers do?",
  "45588": "One doesn't know her in five minutes, does one?",
  "45589": "I ask, whether she loves him?",
  "45590": "Besides, what was the use of seeing each other?",
  "45591": "It's a wonderful city for scholarship and religion?",
  "45592": "Come, have you committed some crime, pursued by human justice, from which I can protect you?",
  "45593": "And your old parents, are they still living?",
  "45594": "Were you of them?",
  "45595": "Have I said anything to trouble you?",
  "45596": "Have?",
  "45597": "Still at your books?",
  "45598": "How big is it?",
  "45599": "And ain't that a big enough majority in any town?",
  "45600": "Why are we stopping?",
  "45601": "Your mother hasn't relented?",
  "45602": "More often than what?",
  "45603": "What right have you to be happy?",
  "45604": "And you will find traces of poison?",
  "45605": "Shall I begin, ma'am?",
  "45606": "Whither ?",
  "45607": "Do you not then know, child, how you can make the hyena gentle, and the tiger tame?",
  "45608": "Is it that you have almost all finished, or are you speaking always?",
  "45609": "How will it benefit?",
  "45610": "Whence proceeded the foregoing folly?",
  "45611": "Now what does the king wish?",
  "45612": "Had it been raining all evening?",
  "45613": "Is it possible that not one of all these men will notice me?",
  "45614": "Did you dust this bureau yesterday morning?",
  "45615": "What culpable act have you been guilty of towards me?",
  "45616": "Oh, do you know?",
  "45617": "What were his books to him?",
  "45618": "Do you hear something?",
  "45619": "Does he love you as you deserve to be loved?",
  "45620": "What time might it be?",
  "45621": "What do I mean by that?",
  "45622": "I suppose you are quite a great lawyer?",
  "45623": "All your arrangements were made?",
  "45624": "So this was the game, was it?",
  "45625": "Of what blood are you, young gentleman?",
  "45626": "Upon what point?",
  "45627": "It is impossible?",
  "45628": "How, then, is life sustained there and kept up in continuous birth after birth?",
  "45629": "I think I may ask, why do you trouble me?",
  "45630": "What could she say?",
  "45631": "How CAN'T I, how can't I?",
  "45632": "What does your worship want to strip for?",
  "45633": "Why did you not say 'no' to the king's suit?",
  "45634": "Have you any chamber on the ground floor where these gentlemen can wait near a good fire?",
  "45635": "Is he not here, then?",
  "45636": "Meaning the master you were to be apprenticed to?",
  "45637": "Do you remember you attacked me for seeking enjoyment in life?",
  "45638": "Did I not tell you the lesson I learned over the CHANT HINDOU?",
  "45639": "What marshes?",
  "45640": "I want to know what young man, do you hear?",
  "45641": "Do you mean the gilt cup?",
  "45642": "Where would you have me go?",
  "45643": "To the north or south?",
  "45644": "Why did you think I invited you out here?",
  "45645": "Was each man, of whatever color, entitled to the fruits of his own labor, or could one man live in idle luxury by the sweat of another's brow, whose skin was darker?",
  "45646": "Who's sitting there?",
  "45647": "Where is the mouth that kiss'd me, the breast I laid to my own?",
  "45648": "And where may that be?",
  "45649": "If, as this young man says, the will provides that the proceeds of the property are to be divided into shares, who has the power to alter these provisions?",
  "45650": "They cold?",
  "45651": "What is it more?",
  "45652": "Why, know you what you did by this device?",
  "45653": "Of power superior why should I complain?",
  "45654": "It's you, young ladies, is it?",
  "45655": "How can he know so many dishes, and so fine ones withal?",
  "45656": "What can that be?",
  "45657": "Or shall the magistrates differ as the communities differ?",
  "45658": "Who is?",
  "45659": "Who said I were?",
  "45660": "Now, what did the proletaires wish?",
  "45661": "How old is he?",
  "45662": "And beyond that?",
  "45663": "Was it not well worth my while paying you that slight commission in return for a guarantee of your future silence?",
  "45664": "You are quite happy yourself?",
  "45665": "If she could have been but just created, to discover herself as a spouseless mother, with no experience of life except as the parent of a nameless child, would the position have caused her to despair?",
  "45666": "Will I be in time?",
  "45667": "And how did you find out that they belonged to me?",
  "45668": "And isn't it a great shame when the old and hardened do torment the young?",
  "45669": "Not blows, father?",
  "45670": "Certainly, how is it likely I should know where I should stay?",
  "45671": "I suppose we'd better have dinner?",
  "45672": "And cheerful?",
  "45673": "Whom did you go with?",
  "45674": "Is there not a constant repetition going on of the story of the fable where the storm, blow as it will, cannot tear the cloak from the shoulders of the traveler, while the first warm rays of sunshine make him throw it off immediately?",
  "45675": "Well, what, general?",
  "45676": "Your majesty would condemn me to the lowest, when I have gained the highest?",
  "45677": "Will what suit me, master?",
  "45678": "You don't mean to go?",
  "45679": "The thin, spare man?",
  "45680": "Have you ever met him?",
  "45681": "What's it matter what she says?",
  "45682": "But after that, what did you do, my friend?",
  "45683": "You did not wish to die on the field, you wished to die at home, did you?",
  "45684": "Did he read my letter?",
  "45685": "Do I not know that that is infinite space, and that it is not a round arch?",
  "45686": "And where would they get the money to rescue us if we was to let on we're no worse than other people?",
  "45687": "What will we do, if we get thirsty?",
  "45688": "And win what race?",
  "45689": "Would you ride with me a little way tomorrow morning?",
  "45690": "Tell me, my dear host, if you do not remember this gentleman?",
  "45691": "Should we not feel we had done you wrong, and taken advantage of you?",
  "45692": "Wherefore this desolation of spirit, this anguish of heart?",
  "45693": "And then, no wages, do you hear, my boy?",
  "45694": "But how live in that city?",
  "45695": "Wots is weight?",
  "45696": "Could you?",
  "45697": "How did he get ahead of us?",
  "45698": "But the captain?",
  "45699": "Explain?",
  "45700": "Who is it, I say?",
  "45701": "What news have you brought me?",
  "45702": "Then why was he so overwhelmed now, having seen them as he expected?",
  "45703": "Where then are those people whom you are to have for your auxiliaries?",
  "45704": "Is not all the world against me?",
  "45705": "The gift of a friend?",
  "45706": "What would the subjects of the extracts I should have had to make from books, or even the books themselves, have signified to me?",
  "45707": "Can any reasons be given for the prevalence of any one or all of the methods?",
  "45708": "But do you think as they've done her in, sir?",
  "45709": "Why should he strive?",
  "45710": "If the lady is hurt as bad as you say, who was it that wrote this note?",
  "45711": "Does your mother wash?",
  "45712": "What would you have done if you had had to go into the army, to go and fight beneath the standard?",
  "45713": "Tom, do you believe the man I gave the money to, is really implicated in this crime?",
  "45714": "Is DEATH that woman's mate?",
  "45715": "And whom have you for an advocate?",
  "45716": "What talk is this to the chief hunter of the village?",
  "45717": "Where are you?",
  "45718": "Do innocent men inveigle nameless vagabonds, and prowl with them about the country as idle robbers do?",
  "45719": "Is he coming in?",
  "45720": "Where was the providence of her simple faith?",
  "45721": "Will you be more so when you have sent me away?",
  "45722": "Is't night?",
  "45723": "With my school?",
  "45724": "Would you care for a cup of tea?",
  "45725": "Why should you not?",
  "45726": "Who can say whether we shall ever see them again?",
  "45727": "Well, what am I to do?",
  "45728": "Am I on an island, or is this the sea board of some continent?",
  "45729": "Hadn't we better send for the doctor?",
  "45730": "Then turning about towards me, asked what were my commands?",
  "45731": "Has that there little bill of mine been heerd on?",
  "45732": "Why should she think I would reproach her?",
  "45733": "How, then, are we to find her?",
  "45734": "You don't really care about these things?",
  "45735": "Is it news of my murder?",
  "45736": "As he had a battle to fight, might it not be best to put a bold face upon it?",
  "45737": "And what was the result of those duels?",
  "45738": "Well, who DOES tell you she has?",
  "45739": "Do you mean to say the climate has really any such influence?",
  "45740": "Can you tell?",
  "45741": "May not the same remark be applied to women?",
  "45742": "What so blind as inexperience?",
  "45743": "Roof ever meet, while they are separated by the four walls, that lie in a contrary position?",
  "45744": "Where are the cards?",
  "45745": "And are not her words too true?",
  "45746": "Couldn't we put it on your back?",
  "45747": "Is there not time enough for that?",
  "45748": "You'll have some meat?",
  "45749": "Well, what's the matter?",
  "45750": "Why should they ask us?",
  "45751": "Is it not a greater wonder that they should be kept up anywhere?",
  "45752": "Why did the old folly end now, and no later?",
  "45753": "Have I been asleep?",
  "45754": "Why did I marry?",
  "45755": "Don't you have some place here on purpose for things to be washed?",
  "45756": "Do you not see that the cannibal has commenced the attack?",
  "45757": "Where will you obtain it?",
  "45758": "Why did you turn aside from your pious practices and good works?",
  "45759": "Orlick there?",
  "45760": "Who comes there?",
  "45761": "Why do you do so?",
  "45762": "You did notice it, then?",
  "45763": "But why at such an hour?",
  "45764": "Gisors?",
  "45765": "You don't comprehend that I want you and your three friends to be of use to me?",
  "45766": "Hallo PUSSUM, when did you come back?",
  "45767": "Why this precautionary view, she asked herself afresh, when her father had complained, at the very least, as little as herself?",
  "45768": "Why, what ails you?",
  "45769": "Do you care for me?",
  "45770": "Where to get the money?",
  "45771": "Is it because you are sorry for the professor?",

  "46165": "What then must be the result?",
  "46166": "What is all settled?",
  "46167": "Saw you those meteors?",
  "46168": "And what will that good treatment be?",
  "46169": "Well, but is there any war on record which was carried on successfully by him, or aided by his counsels, when he was alive?",
  "46170": "Do you want a map?",
  "46171": "But what other is there?",
  "46172": "You understand the rest, then?",

  "46252": "Can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws?",
  "46253": "You have nothing more to say?",
  "46254": "And, as he so resolved, he could not but ask himself the question, whether the charge of the parish ought to be left in the hands of such a man?",
  "46255": "You told him that?",
  "46256": "Would you advise me, whilst able to fight, to throw the arms I hold in my hand to the ground?",

  "46271": "Why had he married the eyes in the photograph?",
  "46272": "Ned, my dear fellow, will you mention what we agreed upon?",
  "46273": "Do you know what that is?",

  "46349": "Yet why a second venture try?",
  "46350": "Do you want him to be fond of you?",
  "46351": "Where would you go?",
  "46352": "What advantages had she?",

  "46382": "May I help you off with your helmet?",
  "46383": "Why has she been crying?",
  "46384": "What can they have done with him?",
  "46385": "Do you love me, then?",
  "46386": "Will they neither obey nor make room for those who will?",
  "46387": "At what point shall we expect the approach of danger?",
  "46388": "But shall not we, ourselves, the truth maintain?",
  "46389": "My dear, do you see?",
  "46390": "But, after all, what is this metaphor called a crown, or rather what is monarchy?",
  "46391": "Is the aggregate power of the general government greater than ought to have been vested in it?",
  "46392": "Do you doubt them?",
  "46393": "Would you take a creature that has not a groat in the world?",

  "46399": "It doesn't matter, does it?",
  "46400": "Why didn't you write, my dear, and say you were coming?",
  "46401": "How do you maintain discipline among your men?",
  "46402": "And are you going to have no breakfast or dinner today?",
  "46403": "You won't tell?",
  "46404": "What make do you like?",

  "46421": "Ah, what have you done to me?",
  "46422": "But what in the name of goodness could provoke you to tempt your fate so long?",
  "46423": "What can more exactly answer the rule laid down, to recommend even those representations of things which have so many other just objections leaving against them?",
  "46424": "Has such and such a perfume done anything for me?",
  "46425": "You want big things that you can make your teeth meet in?",
  "46426": "Why did you tell me those things?",
  "46427": "I am not exempt, and ask now, shall I tend the herds?",
  "46428": "Can it be used against me?",
  "46429": "Where have you hurt yourself?",
  "46430": "Isn't it true there's something good and sweet in her?",
  "46431": "Could you believe in the existence of such a colossal dunce?",

  "46436": "How's his heart?",
  "46437": "But what's in this chest?",
  "46438": "Quite a big girl, I expect?",
  "46439": "You think not?",
  "46440": "Did I shoot straight, nurse?",
  "46441": "Agnes, shall I tell you what about?",
  "46442": "Explained nothing?",

  "46558": "You know what artists do?",
  "46559": "Why do you doubt it?",
  "46560": "How make a road, a canal, or clear a greatly obstructed river?",
  "46561": "You have heard from me lately?",
  "46562": "And what had become of them?",
  "46563": "For love?",
  "46564": "And of monsieur le surintendant?",
  "46565": "Had he that sorrow too?",
  "46566": "For two hours, then?",
  "46567": "By delicate attentions?",
  "46568": "What is their value?",
  "46569": "Are you gloomy or cheerful?",

  "46574": "And why not marry her if she really has so much money?",
  "46575": "You never see her dance, sir, did you?",
  "46576": "How will we give the things?",
  "46577": "But how came you to stay out so late, my dear?",
  "46578": "Who have ye there, my lords?",
  "46579": "Well, who but I?",
  "46580": "What has put that into your head?",
  "46581": "Do you comprehend the full meaning of these words?",
  "46582": "Have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?",
  "46583": "Was he portly, bold, outspoken, and hearty?",
  "46584": "It is there, then?",
  "46585": "What's the matter, really?",

  "46620": "Have we anything else to stay for?",
  "46621": "Didn't I?",
  "46622": "And where be our family mansions and estates?",
  "46623": "But am I talking too much?",
  "46624": "Any orders, sir?",
  "46625": "What were you going past for, eh?",
  "46626": "Why do you say all this to me?",
  "46627": "Idleness?",

  "46629": "What does the end look like?",
  "46630": "But where was this water from?",
  "46631": "We can't take any of it with us, indeed?",
  "46632": "You were brought up by an uncle, then?",
  "46633": "Did she say that to me?",
  "46634": "These are, doubtless, your family arms?",
  "46635": "Was it to them an unknown island, ready to become a magazine for stolen cargoes?",
  "46636": "Then why not change it?",
  "46637": "Yours?",
  "46638": "Who can tell of the mending and patching, of the very wearing midnight hours of needlework which were accomplished before the poor girl went, so that she might not reach her friend's house in actual rags?",

  "46643": "But where are you going?",
  "46644": "James sweet on her, hey?",
  "46645": "Did anyone know that these proofs would be there?",
  "46646": "Oh, they was, eh?",
  "46647": "Is it mad yous are?",
  "46648": "WHAT do you think she'd do if she caught us?",
  "46649": "It can't be useless, or why should it be done?",
  "46650": "Who can doubt this?",
  "46651": "Is he her father?",

  "46657": "How could they win him over to rejoin them?",
  "46658": "You lodge me in your house, close to yourself like this?",
  "46659": "Do you want me to help you or not?",
  "46660": "But why do you always grip your lips?",
  "46661": "Or that they, who see different and dissimilar parts, should judge differently from each other?",
  "46662": "But why should one take trouble to insist upon the advance of science and art in the medieval city?",
  "46663": "How should I not be?",
  "46664": "Hannah, is that milk?",
  "46665": "Would you rather have it in your room, or will you join us at our table d'hote?",
  "46666": "And what was his name?",

  "46691": "I came, then, to inquire how monsieur had passed the night, and if monsieur intended to keep this apartment?",
  "46692": "Just now?",
  "46693": "And would not the chamberlains have a right to be vexed by it?",
  "46694": "Your majesty has the plan?",
  "46695": "Who would believe this childish discipline, received at eight years old, from the hands of a woman of thirty, should influence my propensities, my desires, my passions, for the rest of my life, and that in quite a contrary sense from what might naturally have been expected?",

  "46697": "Seen her?",
  "46698": "What was that I was saying about denouncing myself?",
  "46699": "Have you got your divorce then?",
  "46700": "Why, what's the matter, trow?",
  "46701": "Monsieur would wish to see my camp, and witness for himself our numbers, and the impossibility of his resisting them with success?",
  "46702": "My friends, do you know what those creatures use for wads?",
  "46703": "Don't you know she has?",
  "46704": "Was it worth while, I asked myself, to invent such rubbish at such a moment?",
  "46705": "Is that long ago?",
  "46706": "Ernest was annoyed and surprised, for had not his father and mother been wanting him to be more religious all his life?",
  "46707": "What do you want?",
  "46708": "Oh, was it right my asking him to dinner?",
  "46709": "Will you cause that to be done for me?",
  "46710": "Was his whole life to be shown up as a useless sham a second time?",
  "46711": "Does that please you?",
  "46712": "Kingsford?",
  "46713": "What prevented it?",
  "46714": "Of what nature are they?",
  "46715": "Were they then so many?",
  "46716": "The solemn song be sung ?",
  "46717": "How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains?",
  "46718": "What's the matter, my dear?",
  "46719": "Where's the little scamp got to?",
  "46720": "All right?",
  "46721": "They don't throw 'em about in church, do they?",
  "46722": "Pardon for whom?",
  "46723": "What does it ALL mean?",
  "46724": "What are those men in those carts?",
  "46725": "Horrid little bird, why did it eat all my starch?",
  "46726": "Surely I was serious enough?",
  "46727": "But above all things, I am a marvel to you?",
  "46728": "Would you like to see them?",
  "46729": "Were you ever up there?",
  "46730": "Was it then that you found her again?",
  "46731": "Of what sort had been the life of the man who had stood for years at the top of a pillar?",
  "46732": "What do you think is the cause of so strange a sound?",
  "46733": "And, as it is our last evening together under quite the same circumstances as during all these weeks, will you agree to a plan of mine?",
  "46734": "Do you know that you have composed some of the most beautiful music in the world?",
  "46735": "Don't you think so?",
  "46736": "Were the distinction or separation of possessions entirely useless, can any one conceive, that it ever should have obtained in society?",
  "46737": "Yet, after all, what is there in it that should surprise us?",
  "46738": "What would you not tell her?",
  "46739": "Not by his daughter?",
  "46740": "Who wants them?",
  "46741": "Ah, why?",
  "46742": "And when this principle measures and certifies that some things are equal, or that some are greater or less than others, there occurs an apparent contradiction?",
  "46743": "There was a row, was there?",
  "46744": "It's you, is it, who played this trick on me?",
  "46745": "To my sister?",
  "46746": "What do you mean to do for me, old fellow?",
  "46747": "Which way are you walking, my love?",
  "46748": "You have, eh?",
  "46749": "You do not mean to say that I have persecuted her?",
  "46750": "What interest have they in your death?",
  "46751": "Is it you, my dear master?",
  "46752": "What the devil made you stand lingering there, in the wet?",
  "46753": "Oh, that's the name of the song, is it?",
  "46754": "Do you know how to sew?",
  "46755": "How, then, could power take up the defence of that which the law did not foresee or define, of that which is the opposite of the rights recognized by the legislator?",
  "46756": "What do you mean by locking the door when decent people come to call upon us?",
  "46757": "Was a miner a good miner?",
  "46758": "Biscarrat is a prisoner?",
  "46759": "She is very amiable, then, is she not?",
  "46760": "Do we not wish for an outlet for our surplus population, if I may so express myself?",
  "46761": "Then, as this is the case, and as the knight did really die, how comes it that he now moans and sighs from time to time, as if he were still alive?",
  "46762": "Why should she spare others?",
  "46763": "What may that mean now?",
  "46764": "If she looked favorably upon another, do you mean, monsieur?",
  "46765": "Was he to make her over, to make any portion of her over to others, if, by doing so, she might be able to share the wealth, as well as the coarse manners and uncouth society of her at present unknown connexions?",
  "46766": "How is this strange silence to be accounted for?",
  "46767": "But, putting that aside altogether, what would they live on?",
  "46768": "But how and where?",
  "46769": "Come, will you take me as I am?",
  "46770": "And wherefore?",
  "46771": "What is the matter with me?",
  "46772": "But, pray, when you have been pumped dry one day, what have you got the next?",
  "46773": "Thus, for instance, don't you in the first place want a horse?",
  "46774": "Just a thimbleful of this?",
  "46775": "You'd like to see the room, young man?",
  "46776": "Who knows where the winds will carry this case, and in whose hands it will fall?",
  "46777": "Have we not authorized you to give yourself entirely up to this love?",
  "46778": "What do you say you won't have?",
  "46779": "The vault under the altar?",
  "46780": "Did he voluntarily ignite his own funeral pyre?",
  "46781": "Well, when can you?",
  "46782": "Is it his own, do you think?",
  "46783": "Is it dread of the unknown?",
  "46784": "She has a carriage, then, this niece of the doctor?",
  "46785": "What would you do then?",
  "46786": "And do you think you will marry?",
  "46787": "And are they going farther westward?",
  "46788": "But what says the scout?",
  "46789": "Onny children?",
  "46790": "Was it warm out there, sonny?",
  "46791": "Not do it?",
  "46792": "Will you employ that sword to spill my blood?",
  "46793": "But supposing you did?",
  "46794": "Where did it lead to?",
  "46795": "Where are the street cars and the motors?",
  "46796": "Quarrelled?",
  "46797": "Would you care to take it?",
  "46798": "For one thing, what do we know of you?",
  "46799": "How much did it cost?",
  "46800": "Have you ever had any experience upon the stage?",
  "46801": "On the jury, are you?",
  "46802": "Your excellency knows him?",
  "46803": "We know that the first has been here, but where are the signs of the other?",
  "46804": "How many chloral tabloids did you take?",
  "46805": "And what injury would they do to others?",
  "46806": "Why does it stop there?",
  "46807": "Are you getting about again yet, old fellow?",
  "46808": "Have you any means of transport?",
  "46809": "Why should you put things so bitterly, dearie?",
  "46810": "The millionaire's mite, eh?",
  "46811": "Will you direct me to a lawyer who will aid me?",
  "46812": "Are they real?",
  "46813": "And for what purpose?",
  "46814": "Do you suppose the boat will sail promptly?",
  "46815": "What was its standard?",
  "46816": "Do you remember how silent I was on the drive back?",
  "46817": "I ask, therefore, if a man, in this situation, and guilty of these two errors, is to be regarded as vicious and criminal, however unavoidable they might have been?",
  "46818": "Besides, why were they not allowed to escape?",
  "46819": "Were we really there half an hour?",
  "46820": "Does that satisfy you?",
  "46821": "Won't you have something warm to drink?",
  "46822": "Do you see that, my dear?",
  "46823": "The circumstances?",
  "46824": "Would you imagine it?",
  "46825": "O, is't the custom?",
  "46826": "How many had I?",
  "46827": "What does he want me to do, I wonder?",
  "46828": "What, outside our line?",
  "46829": "Is this the way I must return to native dust?",
  "46830": "You think he has run away, do you, sir?",
  "46831": "That he should appear only at that point?",
  "46832": "What are you saying?",
  "46833": "Foolish indeed?",
  "46834": "Quite strong and well, I hope?",
  "46835": "Is his power of speech gone?",
  "46836": "Would he not have done better to have kept the water that he had decomposed in pure loss, in order to sustain him in the air?",
  "46837": "And he might have asked also, where the industry so necessary for such a trade?",
  "46838": "But if I justify it?",
  "46839": "Was he so awfully hot?",
  "46840": "Isn't that your tobacco lying there?",
  "46841": "What is thy name, fellow?",
  "46842": "Where she would be settled?",
  "46843": "Has madame come in yet?",
  "46844": "And which I can have?",
  "46845": "For who would understand the work within him?",
  "46846": "The spider?",
  "46847": "Haven't I told you I won't give them up?",
  "46848": "Where can we be going in such a tiny pool of water?",
  "46849": "Had you heard that?",
  "46850": "But what then, made her so unhappy?",
  "46851": "No brother at all?",
  "46852": "The question I have to ask myself is, shall I marry him?",
  "46853": "Have you been dragging the river all day, gentlemen?",
  "46854": "Perhaps two o'clock will suit you better?",
  "46855": "Anyone in the room could get out?",
  "46856": "A dream?",
  "46857": "And his eminence, the cardinal?",
  "46858": "Did you answer it yourself?",
  "46859": "Put 'em ashore like maroons?",
  "46860": "And what does she come worming herself in here for?",
  "46861": "What comes next?",
  "46862": "This prisoner, who was he?",
  "46863": "Do you recollect me?",
  "46864": "The lieutenant of musketeers?",
  "46865": "And you don't think the patient would object to him?",
  "46866": "You wish to be, according to your tastes or private friendships, free to destroy my plans and save my enemies?",
  "46867": "If I be right in this, how could we make any entirely new improvement by means of tonnage duties?",
  "46868": "Wherein differ the sea and the land, that a miracle upon one is not a miracle upon the other?",
  "46869": "Will you leave that spinning wheel be, you young devils?",
  "46870": "You're wretched, he's wretched, and what good can come of it?",
  "46871": "You have received a regular letter of advice?",
  "46872": "What was that awful noise?",
  "46873": "I asked him where he meant to go?",
  "46874": "And light of foot?",
  "46875": "Do you feel unwell?",
  "46876": "What is a fontis?",
  "46877": "And will not their wives be the best women?",
  "46878": "How, then, did you deduce the telegram?",
  "46879": "Which of them, seeing us together here, will believe that our meeting and dancing at the gipsy party was by chance?",
  "46880": "Why should not my father see him?",
  "46881": "I have heard a party was to leave the encampment this morning for the lake shore?",
  "46882": "What do you call important?",
  "46883": "And, really, what is the result of all this?",
  "46884": "Beg him to come at once, do you hear?",
  "46885": "What do you do in your cottage when it rains like this?",
  "46886": "If so, what we are afraid of, when we but suspect our enemies will inflict it on us, shall we inflict it on ourselves for certain?",
  "46887": "But where are you going really?",
  "46888": "Did not the sun shine upon him with a halo, so that he was bright as an angel?",
  "46889": "No dinner?",
  "46890": "How much does the proprietor increase the utility of his tenant's products?",
  "46891": "You've never worked at anything like this before, have you?",
  "46892": "Did you see us?",
  "46893": "But who could ever repay half the debt we owe you?",
  "46894": "Could he have thrown down the statue after he'd stripped the corpse?",
  "46895": "Shall we say in one hour's time?",
  "46896": "First of all, what did you see?",
  "46897": "Why, where ever did you go?",
  "46898": "You mean the rascals?",
  "46899": "Is it really calling us?",
  "46900": "Do they not think, they will have their own ends, and be truer to themselves, than to them?",
  "46901": "What humour's this?",
  "46902": "How about when you lose?",
  "46903": "But how about the new orbit in which we are moving?",
  "46904": "Shall I lead the way?",
  "46905": "Where was the poor devil to go?",
  "46906": "Would they not willingly sacrifice a little gift in order to obtain everlasting life?",
  "46907": "Where else could he have put it?",
  "46908": "Won't, if he has the chance, turn on me?",
  "46909": "Why are you explaining?",
  "46910": "Why how do you know?",
  "46911": "Well, did he?",
  "46912": "What the deuce have you done with yourself this last month?",
  "46913": "Why should we load ourselves with a useless burden?",
  "46914": "Had he, beneath the childish face, already recognized the passionate, proud woman?",
  "46915": "What is the reward?",
  "46916": "Why, why, why, are there no harbours of refuge for grown men who have not yet lost them?",
  "46917": "To what good?",
  "46918": "Do you know why I came clear out here afoot?",
  "46919": "Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?",
  "46920": "Is he dead?",
  "46921": "Look here, captain, to speak candidly, do you mean to say that there is anything marvelous in the occurrence?",
  "46922": "What was his purpose?",
  "46923": "There were brave men among them, but of what use was courage when their weapons were powerless against the monster?",
  "46924": "Have you any witness on't?",
  "46925": "Is it a bargain?",
  "46926": "And in the common way of his business does he not expect to be paid for his pictures?",
  "46927": "Who is this youth?",
  "46928": "Not named?",
  "46929": "He hain't been a sittin' so all day, has he?",
  "46930": "And where is your young master?",
  "46931": "How can we truly open the doors, and set free the full genius of our people?",
  "46932": "This what?",
  "46933": "We will go up now, shall we?",
  "46934": "But, it will be asked again, can we on these grounds, admit the existence of a wise and omnipotent author of the world?",
  "46935": "You have taken them away?",
  "46936": "Save it?",
  "46937": "To do with you, my lord?",
  "46938": "What boots it to deplore?",
  "46939": "How do you manage yours?",
  "46940": "What other dreadful things may happen, who can tell?",
  "46941": "How now, what noise is that?",

  "47043": "For how is it probable that he would have been tender of his life, when he was so bitter against his memory?",
  "47044": "And why didn't mamma speak to me about him?",
  "47045": "Is it to be some panel of philosophers, some fancied posterity, or some other outside authority?",

  "47075": "Yes, she loved him, or else how could that have happened which had happened?",
  "47076": "Does not the cone of the shadow cast by the earth extend beyond the moon?",
  "47077": "And must it not be looked upon as a sort of warrant for such actions, if I stay after this?",

  "47086": "Why do philosophers infer, with the greatest certainty, that the moon is kept in its orbit by the same force of gravity, that makes bodies fall near the surface of the earth, but because these effects are, upon computation, found similar and equal?",
  "47087": "In search of what?",
  "47088": "I have no doubt of it, but are these your only reasons for this sudden fancy?",
  "47089": "Do you recognize me at all?",
  "47090": "Expected?",
  "47091": "And in the meanwhile?",
  "47092": "Why did you shake your head?",
  "47093": "Wouldn't you like to go to such a beautiful city as that when you die?",
  "47094": "And what good can you do her?",
  "47095": "Who is there?",
  "47096": "Was she just a common girl, one who went to seek among the tombs for men who were in sorrow, haunted by the recollection of some woman, a wife or a sweetheart, and still troubled by the memory of vanished caresses?",
  "47097": "And to what part of it?",

  "47111": "Isn't it fun?",
  "47112": "What signified that disguise?",
  "47113": "But the grave question was, ought she to do this?",
  "47114": "What are you up to?",

  "47133": "What is it, then?",
  "47134": "Who'll get there first?",
  "47135": "Was cupidity, strengthened by habit, to be laid asleep by a few fine sentences about virtue and union?",
  "47136": "But you will be careful, won't you?",
  "47137": "Nothing, aunt?",

  "47514": "Else, why should it be let so cheaply?",
  "47515": "Is it possible that there can be many such people on earth?",
  "47516": "And might a man be thirsty, and yet unwilling to drink?",
  "47517": "What is the secret, then?",
  "47518": "But was it on her own account, or on account of another, that she exposed herself to such hazards?",
  "47519": "Shall I tell YOU?",
  "47520": "Isn't that a pathetic strain?",
  "47521": "Ain't that a funny name?",

  "47549": "For what is it we call a man of birth, but one who is descended from a long succession of rich and powerful ancestors, and who acquires our esteem by his connexion with persons whom we esteem?",
  "47550": "But what about a thing like this?",
  "47551": "Was not that better than taking him prisoner?",
  "47552": "What was the name that he mentioned?",
  "47553": "Are you ready to be tested?",
  "47554": "How could I have exposed myself in their presence?",
  "47555": "Shall I see if we can manage that?",

  "47557": "Done?",
  "47558": "My dear archdeacon, who ever expected to see you?",
  "47559": "Why, have you not got any water?",
  "47560": "I think she must have guessed, in a way, don't you, what I was going to say?",

  "47562": "Here I have served him faithfully for years, and instead of allowing me to end my days comfortably and in peace, he is going to let me be cut up by the butcher, and my poor body is to be roasted and stewed and eaten?",
  "47563": "What is man's responsibility to society, the conception of which results from the conception of freedom?",
  "47564": "Now, how little do I look like being carried away trembling?",
  "47565": "To men who had risked their lives for him, and besides had done him a great service?",
  "47566": "What's the matter now?",
  "47567": "Is it to be so?",
  "47568": "This morning was it?",
  "47569": "And you don't think it's an answer, eh?",
  "47570": "What other thing do you think I could dream of doing?",
  "47571": "Which house is it?",
  "47572": "By whom?",
  "47573": "But has the problem been well put?",
  "47574": "Could any thing in womanhood be so vile?",
  "47575": "There were two parts in our former scheme of education, were there not?",
  "47576": "Shall I tell you what I always think of you and the fortune yet to come for you, my love?",

  "47578": "Pleased to be thus undeceived, I laughed at his consternation, and asked what brought him thither?",
  "47579": "Was he losing his reason and thinking he heard things which were not for human ears?",
  "47580": "How far may the idler take advantage of the laborer?",

  "47584": "Who could attempt to pursue him?",
  "47585": "Genius banished?",
  "47586": "How dare I?",
  "47587": "Well, prince, whom are we to suspect, then?",
  "47588": "I think you had some good reason for giving up the habit of going there?",
  "47589": "What day of the month is it?",
  "47590": "Is he mad, then, that mysterious old fellow?",
  "47591": "But what sort of a sailor are you?",
  "47592": "Of course you, in your position, must think a girl a castaway who isn't going to be married?",

  "47604": "How came you to be here?",
  "47605": "Can they have gone out?",
  "47606": "Is it of being poor, forsaken, wretched, that you accuse me?",
  "47607": "Did it change her much?",
  "47608": "What was jour offence?",
  "47609": "Aren't you cold?",
  "47610": "Who forbade you?",

  "47642": "What have you got, broth, is it?",
  "47643": "Where are my amusements?",
  "47644": "What has a father to do with it?",
  "47645": "Do I take you with me?",

  "47728": "Will he get used to it?",
  "47729": "Look, will this insolence amend thy lot?",
  "47730": "Who may the four be?",
  "47731": "Do I look as if I liked it?",
  "47732": "Well, is it good?",
  "47733": "Then a man may feel for years that he is good solid company, and be wrong about himself after all?",
  "47734": "Did I say you wasn't beautiful?",
  "47735": "Are we only half way up?",
  "47736": "Pray, when, sir, shall I see you at my house?",
  "47737": "But when is this ball to take place?",
  "47738": "Doesn't it look nice, and grand, and patriarchal?",
  "47739": "And my son?",
  "47740": "But will you gi'e me all the ground the goose flew over?",
  "47741": "Who denies you this right?",
  "47742": "What is the rule in such a case?",
  "47743": "You don't find this life very interesting, I dare say?",
  "47744": "How do you mean to live then?",
  "47745": "Can you guess how he will be likely to behave towards his flatterers and his supposed parents, first of all during the period when he is ignorant of the false relation, and then again when he knows?",
  "47746": "If you see us among scores of women, will you look upon us?",
  "47747": "Where does the remainder go?",
  "47748": "Wasn't it here a minute ago?",
  "47749": "Did any of you see him trailing us?",
  "47750": "And was he sure of what he said?",
  "47751": "I wrote to you for some grammars, if you recollect, and you sent them?",
  "47752": "But shall we go down and watch this absorbing match?",
  "47753": "My plans?",
  "47754": "And who had deserved the worst?",
  "47755": "Do you believe in my instinctive feelings?",
  "47756": "Are you sure I can get all the things I want there?",
  "47757": "On the front?",
  "47758": "Do you not see then, sire, that this is a covert and indirect accusation against yourself, and that while he praises pardoning love, he at the same time condemns and accuses your righteous and punitory wrath?",
  "47759": "Why weary, and palsy the arm at the oar, and the iron, and the lance?",
  "47760": "Her father, eh?",
  "47761": "What difference did it make?",
  "47762": "Are my purposes wont to be so shallow?",
  "47763": "Have you had any tea, by the by?",
  "47764": "What promise?",
  "47765": "Who finds them?",
  "47766": "Digby, whence this fire?",
  "47767": "What are you doing there, my friend?",
  "47768": "Did you treat anybody, sir?",
  "47769": "May I?",
  "47770": "Why can't you help it now?",
  "47771": "And why was I running after her?",
  "47772": "What if the acts he had reconciled himself to because they made him a stronger instrument of the divine glory, were to become the pretext of the scoffer, and a darkening of that glory?",
  "47773": "Shall history be blind to such fatality as this?",
  "47774": "Must I ever be on the way?",
  "47775": "But could you BEAR to have it swinging to your boat?",
  "47776": "Won't you hurry yourself?",
  "47777": "Why, what's the reason, sir?",
  "47778": "What might I not get to know, nearly concerning you?",
  "47779": "What do they mean?",
  "47780": "What do they want?",
  "47781": "Don't what?",
  "47782": "What is it like?",
  "47783": "And do you care?",
  "47784": "Count on my assistance?",
  "47785": "Where are they to be found?",
  "47786": "Must I always be the same?",
  "47787": "Why, pray, did you laugh at this?",
  "47788": "You can't run a church that way, can you?",
  "47789": "And were you warm?",
  "47790": "Whence comes that money?",
  "47791": "Where are we?",
  "47792": "If I told her all my fortune is lost?",
  "47793": "Who is a foolish man?",
  "47794": "What matter?",
  "47795": "Have you anything to say to me?",
  "47796": "Who are you?",
  "47797": "What was he doing?",
  "47798": "So you and the cardinal have been talking about me?",
  "47799": "Have we not botanical gardens?",
  "47800": "Why will you increase my distress by this groundless dispute?",
  "47801": "Is that called a funnel?",
  "47802": "Do they look like that sort of thing?",
  "47803": "How shall I ever repay you?",
  "47804": "Are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and reconciliation?",
  "47805": "Fwhat's she doin' outside?",
  "47806": "And what do you know about the state you talk of?",
  "47807": "Can any man of serious reflection hazard his future happiness upon the belief of a story naturally impossible, repugnant to every idea of decency, and related by persons already detected of falsehood?",
  "47808": "And why should I hesitate to betray that monster, sir?",
  "47809": "Nay, what is there that is not open to your very enemies?",
  "47810": "What is she to us?",
  "47811": "What are you?",
  "47812": "Am I to pay the piper?",
  "47813": "Who's up stairs, you dog?",
  "47814": "Who is this beauty and where is she to be seen, when she was not seen before till you saw her, if you did see her?",
  "47815": "Is it to do us some ill turn?",
  "47816": "What is it they're going to play?",
  "47817": "You wretch, eat up your visitors in your own house?",
  "47818": "Well, but that was only when I was a bit on, don't you know?",
  "47819": "Who's she?",
  "47820": "Where and when have you seen me trifle with a friend's heart and a king's life?",
  "47821": "Even when no one can hear us, may I, by no syllable, by none, not the slightest intimation, remind you of our love?",
  "47822": "Yes, it is a child, but who brought it here?",
  "47823": "Has he solved the antinomy of the division of labor, perpetual cause of the workingman's ignorance, immorality, and poverty?",
  "47824": "Eh?",
  "47825": "Have you made anything out of the tangle?",
  "47826": "And you wouldn't leave them any?",
  "47827": "Am I to be left here in my old age, not a rational soul to speak to, and no other place in the village where there's a drop of decent punch to be had?",
  "47828": "What are you making such a fuss about?",
  "47829": "Well, then, whom does it concern?",
  "47830": "Do you not deduce something from that?",
  "47831": "But who could have taken it?",
  "47832": "One figure whose movements you follow with at least curiosity?",
  "47833": "One?",
  "47834": "What's to become of him?",
  "47835": "May I read it over again?",
  "47836": "How shall I ever mourn enough for all my kinsmen?",
  "47837": "Shall a man not come back to the loveliest lady in all the wide world?",
  "47838": "How long will you be with us?",
  "47839": "Does she know it?",
  "47840": "You heard of the duel?",
  "47841": "Can you show me the place as I go back?",
  "47842": "What else could I do?",
  "47843": "And do you think we have nothing to fear if we land?",
  "47844": "And are you going to make a fisherman of him?",
  "47845": "What kind of spectacle would its hidden hemisphere present to our terrestrial spheroid?",
  "47846": "Would you have doomed me, at any time, to the frost and blight that have hardened and spoiled me?",
  "47847": "Couldn't this have been an accident?",
  "47848": "They don't look bad, do they?",
  "47849": "A secret ambassador?",
  "47850": "Do you not constantly argue that this is not the right place to oppose it?",
  "47851": "Then you have some secret hope to buoy you up and please you with whispers of the future?",
  "47852": "But where are you hurrying now?",
  "47853": "Do you mean to pretend that you didn't know it would be injurious to her to meet you here week after week?",
  "47854": "Isn't that music gay?",
  "47855": "You have the same eye to your own interest, that you always had, I doubt not?",
  "47856": "And how should you understand him?",
  "47857": "A coward?",
  "47858": "What have you done about it?",
  "47859": "What could he get by that?",
  "47860": "Do you know whom she reminds me of?",
  "47861": "The accusation?",
  "47862": "Now I ask, what idea do we form of these bodies or objects, to which we suppose solidity to belong?",
  "47863": "But am I in time?",
  "47864": "Will he not utterly hate a lie?",
  "47865": "I had the best of it this time?",
  "47866": "Can you understand the happiness I get out of my absinthe?",
  "47867": "How know you that?",
  "47868": "Now?",
  "47869": "And what kind of fool?",
  "47870": "Casaubon?",
  "47871": "Is it KETCHING?",
  "47872": "Can you wash dishes right?",
  "47873": "But do they not rather demonstrate the absence of a gang?",
  "47874": "Do you think I'm a presumptuous fool?",
  "47875": "Why need I insist further?",
  "47876": "Is he a poet?",
  "47877": "Am I alive and a reality, or am I but a dream?",
  "47878": "Indeed, sir?",
  "47879": "Then the moon was once inhabited?",
  "47880": "Nothing the matter?",
  "47881": "Are we still under the sea?",
  "47882": "Why didn't you tell me before I came home?",
  "47883": "But tell me, how does he produce the appearance of death?",
  "47884": "Know you what such a moment holds for me?",
  "47885": "Don't you think it must be very uncomfortable to be married to a man whose first wife was perfect?",
  "47886": "Now, my ladies, you strike him not?",
  "47887": "What is the matter, D'Artagnan?",
  "47888": "Is that the idea?",
  "47889": "Will that be necessary?",
  "47890": "You're proud of them?",
  "47891": "Why should an exception be made in her favor?",
  "47892": "Gone where?",
  "47893": "What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman?",
  "47894": "Did ever any one see such a fine piece of beef so completely ruined?",
  "47895": "Yea, is it so bad as that?",
  "47896": "Who does me this?",
  "47897": "And people think it so?",
  "47898": "What have I done that you should pass on me so severe a sentence?",
  "47899": "Did the gentleman give a name?",
  "47900": "Were they then so soon to lose him whom they had snatched from an agonizing death?",
  "47901": "And what shall you do?",
  "47902": "But why so?",
  "47903": "He was disposed to interfere too much, was he?",
  "47904": "Hot and moist?",
  "47905": "Any guerrillas?",
  "47906": "Is he goodly enough?",
  "47907": "And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?",
  "47908": "He is a rebel, then?",
  "47909": "Did you ever meet with anything like that man out of this blessed country?",
  "47910": "What were we who had strayed in here?",
  "47911": "Have I not sworn to you that I loved you in return?",
  "47912": "How have you passed the time?",
  "47913": "Why shouldn't she come down?",
  "47914": "Had it struck on a submerged rock, or on an enormous wreck?",
  "47915": "But what if it all had been lost?",
  "47916": "Why had that man taken to flight on the arrival of the police, instead of entering a complaint?",
  "47917": "If it isn't, what are we here for?",
  "47918": "But the light?",
  "47919": "And what happens?",
  "47920": "Kindly?",
  "47921": "But what step would you propose to me?",
  "47922": "Why should you want to spite her?",
  "47923": "Don't you see, my boy, that these things are debits?",
  "47924": "Can men refuse to be pleased with words of gentle advice?",
  "47925": "And just actions cause justice, and unjust actions cause injustice?",
  "47926": "Shall he live?",
  "47927": "What d'ye mean by that?",
  "47928": "Do you think he can last till morning?",
  "47929": "Don't you want to destroy it at ONCE?",
  "47930": "What, if I am steeped in poverty?",
  "47931": "An advice?",
  "47932": "No one?",
  "47933": "Oh, but can't you have the kindness to take me in?",
  "47934": "Is it in this mode that the spirit of mutual support and common effort for the common good, is to be cultivated?",
  "47935": "You will not do that?",
  "47936": "And there, don't you see?",
  "47937": "Did you say?",
  "47938": "Oh, what are you doing?",
  "47939": "Where is the corpse lying?",
  "47940": "Is not this so?",
  "47941": "How many of their friends must have fallen in the struggle?",
  "47942": "Do you see this woman sitting beside me?",
  "47943": "And when you see the same evils in the tyrannical man, what do you say of him?",
  "47944": "Are, however, pleasures and pains strictly commensurable?",
  "47945": "Do you hear me?",
  "47946": "My dear fellow, are you really on such good terms with her as to venture to take me to her box?",
  "47947": "How may I aid in the adventure?",
  "47948": "Yes, who are YOU?",
  "47949": "Not serious, I hope?",
  "47950": "Is he here?",
  "47951": "Louisa turned her eyes to his face, and asked him what fault was that?",
  "47952": "Kutuzov?",
  "47953": "What mysterious results was the future reserving for the investigation of science?",
  "47954": "What do you mean by horrid?",
  "47955": "A horse for your lackey?",
  "47956": "How could one fail to understand?",
  "47957": "How's that?",
  "47958": "How long has he been going on thus?",
  "47959": "And that human virtue is justice?",
  "47960": "Who is on duty?",
  "47961": "Did not I say so?",
  "47962": "Do fine work?",
  "47963": "But why did we teach you that?",
  "47964": "Why did they do it?",
  "47965": "Anybody been beating 'ee?",
  "47966": "A bird of the air?",
  "47967": "It would have been terrible if any cloud had come across a friendship like ours, would it not?",
  "47968": "Did not the royal diadem shine in my hair?",
  "47969": "What doom was his own father's?",
  "47970": "Who shall it be if not he who does this work well?",
  "47971": "How many bedrooms?",
  "47972": "Well, you see the hills beyond?",
  "47973": "And can it be my fault, can I have done anything wrong?",
  "47974": "And what if we came too late?",
  "47975": "You have turned full steam on?",
  "47976": "Have you heard?",
  "47977": "Have the humanistic studies not given to him, as to so many of his contemporaries, a distinctive mental bent?",
  "47978": "What interest, let me ask, have the people in the settlement of this question?",
  "47979": "And how should I, having been a hunter all my life?",
  "47980": "Why, what's the matter with you?",
  "47981": "And why, if you knew me, do you let me die?",
  "47982": "But what is to be done?",
  "47983": "You do not doubt that, I hope?",
  "47984": "Is it interesting?",
  "47985": "Eureka?",
  "47986": "What do they call it, that which maketh them proud?",
  "47987": "Why do you think so?",
  "47988": "What is it, dear one?",
  "47989": "Could I retract my word, and take upon myself the responsibility of compromising the future of my companions?",
  "47990": "And is it any better as it is?",
  "47991": "Answer, what?",
  "47992": "But is there no danger from the bite?",
  "47993": "How could I remember you?",
  "47994": "But do you understand me?",
  "47995": "What are we going to do, i'faith?",
  "47996": "Shall I obtain permission not to do so till I have spoken to the king, sire?",
  "47997": "Linon, have you?",
  "47998": "Would you yield to the thirst for gold?",
  "47999": "At what hour did he leave your hotel?",
  "48000": "Yet, if they ask me why I am not dancing, what am I to say?",
  "48001": "Why should you mind what they call it?",
  "48002": "Because I envy you, eh?",
  "48003": "Are you as bad as that?",
  "48004": "Do you think you would?",
  "48005": "Who is there who is not fifty years old?",
  "48006": "Did you come for your interest?",
  "48007": "How d'ye do?",
  "48008": "You heard him?",
  "48009": "Are not these large enough?",
  "48010": "Is it what you call a breakfast cap?",

  "48016": "No, where?",
  "48017": "Is it so necessary that I should stop to think of manners and customs?",
  "48018": "Oh, wouldn't you?",
  "48019": "And how is the error to be corrected?",
  "48020": "And what did she do?",
  "48021": "Why doesn't he give me a cheque for the money?",
  "48022": "What d'ye mean?",
  "48023": "Then, are your names, gentlemen?",
  "48024": "Sleepy?",
  "48025": "Can it, gentlemen?",
  "48026": "Demmit, you don't mean to say you want me, do you, demmit?",
  "48027": "Why does it make you angry when you are looked at?",
  "48028": "What do you mean by your insinuations, anyhow?",
  "48029": "You've been dull, I expect?",
  "48030": "But I wonder if she would care to?",
  "48031": "And should you mind that?",
  "48032": "Now, what lunacy has been your latest?",
  "48033": "Well, maman, are you perfectly well?",
  "48034": "For what would they risk their rascal carcasses but money?",
  "48035": "Where has she come from?",
  "48036": "Of the principal?",
  "48037": "You haven't it?",
  "48038": "If the frontier line became the sea coast, what might be looked for then?",
  "48039": "Have you ever noticed them?",
  "48040": "Who were the visitors?",
  "48041": "Gentlemen, shall we entreat you to be witnesses?",

  "48046": "How can I get to her castle?",
  "48047": "Are you a man?",
  "48048": "But I was speaking of yourself, you know?",
  "48049": "Why did he throw that paper into the sea?",
  "48050": "Are you going to stay a day or two?",
  "48051": "And you are going to say it now?",
  "48052": "Now, if we are equal in that which makes us men, how can the accidental distribution of secondary faculties detract from our manhood?",
  "48053": "Have I the lady's promise for that?",
  "48054": "And why was I arrested?",
  "48055": "It received us poor and destitute, and now what is wanting to us five fellows who fell on it from the sky?",
  "48056": "What shall I do until then?",
  "48057": "What do you mean by a reception?",
  "48058": "Will you come down?",
  "48059": "How did this happen?",
  "48060": "I now in my turn began to inquire where they were bound?",

  "48071": "Where the devil are they?",
  "48072": "What is the name of this place?",
  "48073": "Don't you think we may say there does not exist a single person so honest that he has never stolen anything whatever in his life?",
  "48074": "What, my child?",
  "48075": "Is there anyone else around here who might take him?",
  "48076": "Am I not hale in wind and limb?",

  "50048": "Ah, indeed?",
  "50049": "Does it exist?",
  "50050": "How many?",
  "50051": "You wouldn't like to be a poet when you grow up?",
  "50052": "Then her life won't be altogether wasted, you think?",
  "50053": "In what manner?",
  "50054": "Will it drive me out of my mind?",
  "50055": "Would she, aunt?",
  "50056": "Pretty?",
  "50057": "Well, have you seen him?",
  "50058": "Is this one also a complementary colour?",
  "50059": "Farebrother?",
  "50060": "I wonder who he was?",
  "50061": "And when can I see this young lady, for whom I already feel so great a sympathy?",
  "50062": "Let him profit by the means as I found out?",
  "50063": "What's that about six pound a year?",
  "50064": "What is it, then, sire?",
  "50065": "You are quite sure that you do not want to sell your land?",
  "50066": "How are delights and miseries to be weighed, and reasonably balanced?",
  "50067": "In exchange for that you refuse me?",
  "50068": "Are you going to tell me that it is impossible?",
  "50069": "May I look?",
  "50070": "Is this the end of all my bursting prayers?",
  "50071": "And what did you learn from him?",
  "50072": "How was the play?",
  "50073": "But does it shut equally well?",
  "50074": "What's yo' name?",
  "50075": "How near do you get to it?",
  "50076": "And who is the magistrate who has reason to complain of the agent?",
  "50077": "Who are you talking of?",
  "50078": "I wonder if I shall ever be happy enough to have real lace on my clothes and bows on my caps?",
  "50079": "Did you think he was too good to go?",
  "50080": "Come, now?",
  "50081": "Marry whom?",
  "50082": "You know his house, don't you?",
  "50083": "Was it not unhealthful?",
  "50084": "What happened during the night?",
  "50085": "If two and two made four when we were happy together, surely they make four now?",
  "50086": "How near to you?",
  "50087": "Has the queen any further commands for me now?",
  "50088": "May it not frighten her terribly?",
  "50089": "And what was the end of this worthy man?",
  "50090": "Are the oysters good?",
  "50091": "Which colour strikes most?",
  "50092": "When the devil would you have a man be afraid but when there is so much cause?",
  "50093": "But what happened ?",
  "50094": "But how came that first note to be inserted in your journal?",
  "50095": "Then addressing herself to me, asked, with ineffable complacency, if I was the person who had been so cruelly used by robbers?",
  "50096": "But why could he not tell you this?",
  "50097": "Unseen then?",
  "50098": "Are you sure you don't mind?",
  "50099": "Will you give me an egg to eat?",
  "50100": "Would she ever live to see it?",
  "50101": "A cart?",
  "50102": "Will you sell your rapier?",
  "50103": "What is the reader's conceived opinion of the duties and labors of a missionary in a heathen land?",
  "50104": "But if his daily death was the theme of the legend, why was it celebrated by an annual ceremony?",
  "50105": "Old fellow, can you let me have thirty pounds?",
  "50106": "How do you manage to get people to talk about it?",
  "50107": "Did not you see me tip you the wink to leave off in time?",
  "50108": "A shilling a leg?",
  "50109": "Rid myself of that nightmare?",
  "50110": "Could there possibly have been a more exact guide?",
  "50111": "Why, do you think I should be any happier if I were to feel disturbed about the excavations you tell me of?",
  "50112": "But how am I to climb?",
  "50113": "What is your love to mine?",
  "50114": "Love covers a multitude of sins, and of whom could you ask more freely than of him?",
  "50115": "Did you observe that man's eyes while he was speaking to us?",
  "50116": "And who is she, this woman that you want to see?",
  "50117": "Still, are they going to do it shortly?",
  "50118": "What do you mean, master of mine?",
  "50119": "And of what other trees?",
  "50120": "May we not conjecture that they belonged to the people who resided in the town, and who were victorious in the engagement?",
  "50121": "Could a man be born to a more perfect glory?",
  "50122": "You are vexed?",
  "50123": "You'll not say anything about it at home, will you?",
  "50124": "To our journey's end?",
  "50125": "Don't you want supper?",
  "50126": "To what unexpected good fortune, to what accident, am I to ascribe this happy meeting?",
  "50127": "How did it fare with the missions in these days of woe and terror?",
  "50128": "And how is everybody?",
  "50129": "Perhaps you'd like to spend a couple of shillings or so, in a bottle of currant wine by and by, up in the bedroom?",
  "50130": "With what object?",
  "50131": "Or is it the matter?",
  "50132": "Do you wish a step, or some place in the government?",
  "50133": "Would it not be better to rest now?",
  "50134": "But what then?",
  "50135": "Am I right or not?",
  "50136": "Why impossible?",
  "50137": "It is agreed, then, that I carry you off with me?",
  "50138": "You don't think one needs the EXPERIENCE of having been married?",
  "50139": "Quite seriously?",
  "50140": "Who should prevent you?",
  "50141": "The vastness of this word?",
  "50142": "Whose horse is waiting at your gate?",
  "50143": "Oh, why should I injure a man both worthy and innocent, who has only done me services and honour?",
  "50144": "Why did you light the thirsty lamp?",
  "50145": "Would he be in time to rescue?",
  "50146": "How did he come to be there?",
  "50147": "Why aren't I good enough to attend her filthy brat?",
  "50148": "The meeting?",
  "50149": "Can't read it?",
  "50150": "Whence doth this aspect horrible proceed?",
  "50151": "Why do you look first on one side and then on the other, as if you were afraid of being arrested yourself, you whose business it is to arrest others?",
  "50152": "Will your majesty deign to excuse me?",
  "50153": "Shall we say it is because we have won an empire?",
  "50154": "What do you talk about?",
  "50155": "How can his readers take on trust his statements concerning the births, marriages, divorces, and deaths of a crowd of people, whose names are scarcely known to this generation?",
  "50156": "Or why should not all the three walk abreast?",
  "50157": "Don't you know how one longs to have something to do for some one who belongs to one?",
  "50158": "And is it so, maidy?",
  "50159": "Were they hungry?",
  "50160": "Won't you stay?",
  "50161": "Has he committed suicide?",
  "50162": "Do your ears tell you that they have traced our retreat?",
  "50163": "What made you sit in such an awkward position?",
  "50164": "Is not this the way in which the large landed proprietors have gradually raised their rents, as fast as they have ascertained by the increase in population and the development of industry how much society can produce from their property?",
  "50165": "Why shouldn't we both be married, instead of sitting through the long winter evenings by our solitary firesides?",
  "50166": "You think me rather parsimonious, don't you?",
  "50167": "Why are you so very shy, and so very sombre?",
  "50168": "Would any one of us be here if we weren't paupers?",
  "50169": "What other initiative, what greater authority, do you ask?",
  "50170": "Why do you serve in this capacity?",
  "50171": "How do you like it?",
  "50172": "What month?",
  "50173": "More than in other years?",
  "50174": "But could he be sure that this was all that was to be said about this enigma, and that he should never arrive at a solution?",
  "50175": "Half a mile, you say?",
  "50176": "Has anything happened, ma'am?",
  "50177": "Where is the man who brought the letter?",
  "50178": "Whither am I going?",
  "50179": "Shall I have it, or shall I not?",
  "50180": "And all my limbs unbroken?",
  "50181": "Why did they?",
  "50182": "Do you know where we could get one?",
  "50183": "Well, and you want your fortune told?",
  "50184": "Was it his wife, or else as like her as any sister could be?",
  "50185": "Does that mean that all men have a right to all property?",
  "50186": "How could she tell where I had got the handkerchief?",
  "50187": "And can bear to have my morsel of bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my cup?",
  "50188": "One thing and another commit?",
  "50189": "Oh, isn't that too bad?",
  "50190": "Can you tell me, this last time, that you feel quite, quite sure, no new affections of mine, and no new duties of mine, will ever interpose between us?",
  "50191": "You remember all this quite clearly, but how is it that your reason calmly accepted all the manifest absurdities and impossibilities that crowded into your dream?",
  "50192": "What troops are these that seem to be passing through the wood?",
  "50193": "You'd never think it to look at me, would you?",
  "50194": "What shall I sing?",
  "50195": "Is there no gentleman or lady of virtue in this neighbourhood, to whom I may fly, only till l can find a way to get to my poor father and mother?",
  "50196": "What object could they have?",
  "50197": "And do you suppose she understands nothing?",
  "50198": "Could I have caused that girl's death and procreated this being?",
  "50199": "What do the women find so impressive in that little brat?",
  "50200": "Well, sir?",
  "50201": "And I must cross it with silver, I suppose?",
  "50202": "A letter?",
  "50203": "Whom follow?",
  "50204": "What means this profession of faith?",
  "50205": "Again, if the uncooling or warm principle were imperishable, the fire when assailed by cold would not have perished or have been extinguished, but would have gone away unaffected?",
  "50206": "His wife?",
  "50207": "What place is that?",
  "50208": "Is not this thing which you advise me to do a little cowardly?",
  "50209": "Who has paid adulation to the nation while claiming for it a sovereignty which it was incapable of exercising?",
  "50210": "Have you not wished to go?",
  "50211": "Died he of sickness or through treachery?",
  "50212": "Isn't this rather sudden?",
  "50213": "To how much?",
  "50214": "Why, why are people all balls of bitter dust?",
  "50215": "You tell me nothing?",
  "50216": "What means this?",
  "50217": "Who calls?",
  "50218": "Why should I deny it?",
  "50219": "What is the matter with them?",
  "50220": "Is it not inconceivable, that a tribune should have power to imprison a consul, and the people have no authority to degrade him when he uses that honor which he received from them, to their detriment?",
  "50221": "Now, children, which is it to be?",
  "50222": "Is the doctrine warranted by FACTS?",
  "50223": "Then what will you do with me then?",
  "50224": "Can anyone grasp what such an offer meant at such a spot, made to a man who, to tell the truth, is very fond of a smoke after meals?",
  "50225": "From whom had they that information?",
  "50226": "Shall I ever see your sister?",
  "50227": "Then your duchess is still at the waters?",
  "50228": "Have you heard anything of the case?",
  "50229": "Do you wish to try to do so?",
  "50230": "After all, he said in his bitterness, what can a woman care about so much as house and furniture?",
  "50231": "What was his devotion worth to her?",
  "50232": "I suppose I could walk with the rest?",
  "50233": "But why waste more words on them?",
  "50234": "What was it fell last night from the evil moon?",
  "50235": "Well, then, I said, why couldn't she tell her husband to fetch a dog?",
  "50236": "Just as she was, in a manner, pretending to listen?",
  "50237": "Two words?",
  "50238": "It was he who told you to invite me to appear with these studs?",
  "50239": "And how were they treated?",
  "50240": "Do you bring me a message from the king, or have you made a bold hit, and wish me to take you again under my protection?",
  "50241": "Isn't it a terrible thing to die so young as that?",
  "50242": "How many times have we seen it?",
  "50243": "Well, then, what possessed you to go down there this time of night?",
  "50244": "And do you know who is his lieutenant?",
  "50245": "Did not you take heed, quoth he, a little before he opened his mouth to speak, what a shogging, shaking, and wagging his head did keep?",
  "50246": "I suppose that's what your humanity would suggest?",
  "50247": "And are you going away, then, really?",
  "50248": "Do you not know that you have been dead this long time?",
  "50249": "How long a delay do you wish for?",
  "50250": "Well, what will you give for it?",
  "50251": "What evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of your senses?",
  "50252": "But should you not interfere?",
  "50253": "It would trouble me sadly to make him unhappy, for I couldn't fall in love with the dear old fellow merely out of gratitude, could I?",
  "50254": "Where were thy senses?",
  "50255": "Mademoiselle, how could you believe that?",
  "50256": "Do you understand what the word pity means?",
  "50257": "You mean it makes you feel that you have nothing?",
  "50258": "But what about women?",
  "50259": "Besides, how could one land on the opposite bank among willows which would scuttle the boat, and with a flood of unknown extent?",
  "50260": "Have I, indeed, said anything you should answer with such a cruel remark?",
  "50261": "What hinders it?",
  "50262": "Would you care fer any one that took all those?",
  "50263": "You haven't breakfasted?",
  "50264": "So what have you done with it?",
  "50265": "You mean when a woman has children?",
  "50266": "What is there to surprise anyone in that?",
  "50267": "If I only had it here, wretch that I am, what more should we want?",
  "50268": "Well, monseigneur?",
  "50269": "Do you wish me to begin admiring the peoples?",
  "50270": "Do I not myself know that I am at this moment in want of a dozen pages, and that I am sick with cudgelling my brains to find them?",
  "50271": "Which do ye choose?",
  "50272": "Did you observe any one during the first act?",
  "50273": "Have you heard the news?",
  "50274": "And what IS this on my head?",
  "50275": "Why deceive us further?",
  "50276": "And by whom are you forbidden?",
  "50277": "Who has done this?",
  "50278": "And who was that man?",
  "50279": "What happened to you?",
  "50280": "What put her up to clearing out?",
  "50281": "To play blindman's bluff?",
  "50282": "Well, sire?",
  "50283": "Any answer?",
  "50284": "How do you do?",
  "50285": "You wouldn't like your relations to be starved, even if they were only third cousins, would you?",
  "50286": "And so, is it quite certain he is coming?",
  "50287": "If nobody were rich, who would employ the poor?",
  "50288": "And what do you expect the king to reply?",
  "50289": "But if she does?",
  "50290": "Where is he who could say it no?",
  "50291": "I have surely not been dreaming, have I?",
  "50292": "Shall we light a fire, so as to signal our presence on the coast?",
  "50293": "Do you think of dying, my lord?",
  "50294": "What does the poetry or the value of the ring signify?",
  "50295": "What do you believe, what do you KNOW?",
  "50296": "How's my poor brother?",
  "50297": "Is he so hard, then?",
  "50298": "Why did you come?",
  "50299": "Oh, mother, what is the matter?",
  "50300": "And what house is this?",
  "50301": "What, no second club?",
  "50302": "Will fish go down with them?",
  "50303": "May it not, theoretically, include as much of the universe as is known to man?",
  "50304": "Is it my affair?",
  "50305": "I, madame?",
  "50306": "What o' devil d'ye mean, cried he, to sit idly here like a pack of loitering sneaksbies, and see us stranded, while you may help us, and tow us off into the current?",
  "50307": "Why should you go about the parish?",
  "50308": "Who is this ancient teacher or who is his prototype if he is an ideal being?",
  "50309": "What could those words mean?",
  "50310": "Did you never do any robbery in your life?",
  "50311": "What devil?",
  "50312": "Why are we less prompt to provide for our own safety than the rest of the citizens?",
  "50313": "I said, do you hear me?",
  "50314": "For what purpose?",
  "50315": "Is his hour past?",
  "50316": "Do you know of any other?",
  "50317": "For how, under different wills, should we find complete unity of ends?",
  "50318": "Did you ever see anything to equal it, as you steam away in the sunset?",
  "50319": "Were you thinking of your birth then?",
  "50320": "Look at a plant in the midst of its range, why does it not double or quadruple its numbers?",
  "50321": "Couldn't he have waited for the good season to increase his chances?",
  "50322": "Am I too heavy?",
  "50323": "Shall we agree to this plan, or not?",
  "50324": "Buy back your wheelbarrow?",
  "50325": "Do they begin by exciting the detestation of the very instruments of their intended usurpations?",
  "50326": "But, surely, if he were convinced that it was absolutely necessary for the vindication of his innocence, he would submit to charge himself with an expense so necessary, not only for himself, but for his family?",
  "50327": "Up so early?",
  "50328": "Do I know you?",
  "50329": "His things and his bag are with him?",
  "50330": "Another shock, eh?",
  "50331": "Can I trust you?",
  "50332": "Other people's?",
  "50333": "And did you see her just now, as she spoke of her father?",
  "50334": "And fought?",
  "50335": "Was there no other who contributed?",
  "50336": "Under what obligation do I lie of making such an abuse of time?",
  "50337": "Could any other man express what they knew so well how to express in tones and in words?",
  "50338": "But what book is that next it?",
  "50339": "It surely cannot be you who made shoes for me at the l'ecole militaire?",
  "50340": "How must I do?",
  "50341": "But how, sir, said I, did you part?",
  "50342": "Where was the first lion?",
  "50343": "When didn't you?",
  "50344": "What is its name?",
  "50345": "That is, you mean that sin keeps him back?",
  "50346": "To whom was this letter addressed?",
  "50347": "Carlo, did I offer any violence?",
  "50348": "Couldn't stand it, eh?",
  "50349": "But if there be anything which is of such a nature as to be and not to be, that will have a place intermediate between pure being and the absolute negation of being?",
  "50350": "Who are your uncles and aunts?",
  "50351": "What was he saying yesterday?",
  "50352": "If much comfort cannot be expected from the friendship of a reformed rake of superior abilities, what is the consequence when he lacketh sense, as well as principles?",
  "50353": "And do you think I ever shall?",
  "50354": "Why do you want me?",
  "50355": "I ask you what year is it?",
  "50356": "What sent you hither?",
  "50357": "Was such a thing ever heard of?",
  "50358": "What had she to do with the justice or injustice of other people?",
  "50359": "Which is it to be, death or life?",
  "50360": "Jule, you won't go, will you?",
  "50361": "How will they proceed?",
  "50362": "Not a cloud?",
  "50363": "What has that boy been about?",
  "50364": "Or any other time?",
  "50365": "Are they not already in the land?",
  "50366": "What did they want there?",
  "50367": "To which?",
  "50368": "The surface of a sphere?",
  "50369": "Are they happy?",
  "50370": "Is it a good road, and how far?",
  "50371": "And the lord chamberlain?",
  "50372": "Mayor?",
  "50373": "Had you ever any reason to complain of him?",
  "50374": "Will you promise me then to be at peace?",
  "50375": "A voyage?",
  "50376": "And they found the child?",
  "50377": "Yet what will the energy of true genius not effect?",
  "50378": "What is there to hinder?",
  "50379": "Is it a lonely farm?",
  "50380": "And can I play with him, too?",
  "50381": "Why do I want to go?",
  "50382": "What business, said she, had you to read my letter?",
  "50383": "Or, if it ought to give any, what are the different parts of education which it ought to attend to in the different orders of the people?",
  "50384": "Why don't he, in such a case, sell his horses, let his house, turn off his servants, and make a thorough reform at once?",
  "50385": "You don't mean to say you have forgotten that you promised to make half a dozen calls with me today?",
  "50386": "What time did he set off for town?",
  "50387": "And are you coming with us?",
  "50388": "When had that question been settled?",
  "50389": "Had he travelled?",
  "50390": "And why have you such an air of sadness aboard?",
  "50391": "And what has become of the business?",
  "50392": "Was it an instant of enchantment only or long hours and years and ages?",
  "50393": "Is the lady so very alarming?",
  "50394": "And how is it possible to help losing a stronghold that is not relieved, above all when surrounded by a host of determined enemies in their own country?",
  "50395": "Your marriage?",
  "50396": "Won't you, young fellow?",
  "50397": "Your aunt?",
  "50398": "By means of what organ?",
  "50399": "What DOES the face matter?",
  "50400": "All of it?",
  "50401": "Is he lost, I wonder, in this desert?",
  "50402": "Can you enlighten me on that point?",
  "50403": "What makes her want to see ye?",
  "50404": "Do you mean to ask this girl to marry you?",
  "50405": "Are you quite well?",
  "50406": "And what this?",
  "50407": "Did not his land produce sufficient of everything?",
  "50408": "When did it break out?",
  "50409": "Why add up the elements of resistance and anarchy?",
  "50410": "And pray, if you are so good, who ventures to affirm that?",
  "50411": "What for?",
  "50412": "What are you thinking of doing?",
  "50413": "How could we live and where could we live?",
  "50414": "Is it so nice as all that?",
  "50415": "But what do I say?",
  "50416": "Or wasn't it meant for my ears?",
  "50417": "Whom does this belong to?",
  "50418": "Who are you, my good man?",
  "50419": "Do they think the prefect will be glad to dine down there under a tent like a gipsy?",
  "50420": "Had I dreamt?",
  "50421": "Why did she so lose courage?",
  "50422": "And can you not understand why I said fortune favours us?",
  "50423": "What's the use of living?",
  "50424": "Are you well and happy?",
  "50425": "What to do?",
  "50426": "Did the sun, which shone so brightly everywhere else, really fall upon him?",
  "50427": "And if there is truth in what has preceded, he will be wedded to an image of pleasure which is thrice removed as to truth from the pleasure of the oligarch?",
  "50428": "What brings you here, dear heart?",
  "50429": "What were they now?",
  "50430": "I suppose you haven't got a brass farthing, have you?",
  "50431": "You understand what I say?",
  "50432": "Will it be said that the opposition between man and the divine being is illusory, and that it arises from the opposition that exists between the individual man and the essence of entire humanity?",
  "50433": "Are they in safety?",
  "50434": "Sneezed, did you?",
  "50435": "I'm not?",
  "50436": "Have you forgotten that a son ought to love and honour his father and mother?",
  "50437": "Had the remembrance of her teaching utterly vanished, and the last trace of her maternal influence quite faded away?",
  "50438": "Don't you know the cawing crow lives five times as long as a man?",
  "50439": "What do you want with me?",
  "50440": "You are staying the whole evening, I hope?",
  "50441": "Why shouldn't she like him?",
  "50442": "What weight would that carry?",
  "50443": "Doesn't she look lovely?",
  "50444": "Good gracious, what noise is that?",
  "50445": "Have you seen the princess?",
  "50446": "Is it because there is no word tender enough to be your name?",
  "50447": "Won't you try and care for me a little?",
  "50448": "So you wanted to get away, my dear, did you?",
  "50449": "Did it not show that he comprehended his relations with her?",
  "50450": "What need of positive law where natural justice is, of itself, a sufficient restraint?",
  "50451": "But how was it settled between you, mamma?",
  "50452": "What means this?",
  "50453": "What is it that is strange?",
  "50454": "Coming in to have a short time?",
  "50455": "Do you reproach me?",
  "50456": "And what do you pick your teeth with, after devouring that fat goose?",
  "50457": "Had not his books taught him that he was a man?",
  "50458": "And will you mention to me the yearly sum which would repay you for managing these affairs which we have discussed together?",
  "50459": "What'll be over?",
  "50460": "But then, what are we here for?",
  "50461": "Why shouldn't I have them all to myself?",
  "50462": "You'll wait and wave your handkerchief when I get to that turn in the road?",
  "50463": "Two years ago, wasn't it?",
  "50464": "Now, what do you think the lawyer making the inquiries wants?",
  "50465": "You have?",
  "50466": "De qui?",
  "50467": "What was it, my dear?",
  "50468": "She was young, you say?",
  "50469": "His effect?",
  "50470": "What is life to you?",
  "50471": "Where are you living now?",
  "50472": "How can I tell whet ye say?",
  "50473": "Have they?",
  "50474": "Shall my messenger, in your name, tell your people to give in?",
  "50475": "And does he still tip you?",
  "50476": "If he forsakes his faith, how doth it profit you?",
  "50477": "Why do you do such a strange thing?",
  "50478": "Why did you think so?",
  "50479": "Does he say so now?",
  "50480": "And both should be in harmony?",
  "50481": "Why, you love him, do you not?",
  "50482": "I hope I am doing nothing wrong in asking it again?",
  "50483": "Had he spoken of himself, of himself as he was or wished to be?",
  "50484": "If he did not, what would she do?",
  "50485": "And ought not the same natures to have the same pursuits?",
  "50486": "What next?",
  "50487": "Won't you come to see mamma?",
  "50488": "Why did it happen?",
  "50489": "But our troop horses?",
  "50490": "Nay, tell me, how many histories are there filled with these marvels?",
  "50491": "It's likely, isn't it, then there would be two girls with a name like that?",
  "50492": "Do you mind my smoking?",
  "50493": "How, then, does this passion for gain, abandoned to itself, turn to the prejudice of society?",
  "50494": "If a kiss had been imprinted?",
  "50495": "Well, do you attend the function tonight?",
  "50496": "Whence the cause of this singular intoxication, the consequences of which might have been very disastrous?",
  "50497": "But they have wisdom, else what is the use of having died?",
  "50498": "Always a muddle?",
  "50499": "Have I given no testimony of my sincerity and of my passion?",
  "50500": "That's everything?",
  "50501": "Is this the same lemonade of which you partook?",
  "50502": "And what does he charge?",
  "50503": "But the horses?",
  "50504": "In summer?",
  "50505": "And what the devil was the matter with his head?",
  "50506": "Why do we love?",
  "50507": "And what do the rulers call the people?",
  "50508": "And how much was the residue?",
  "50509": "What do you think he replied?",
  "50510": "Or is it equally criminal in every body?",
  "50511": "Perhaps you think I shall abandon you, dear grandpapa, and that I shall forget you when I am married?",
  "50512": "What's coming next?",
  "50513": "Suppose we had attained our end, would it not have been better to have found continents in broad daylight than a country plunged in utter darkness?",
  "50514": "Did your father speak of it?",
  "50515": "What was that noise?",
  "50516": "Your father breaks horses, don't he?",
  "50517": "What made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here?",
  "50518": "An old hag who said her son had the plague?",
  "50519": "How then was it closed?",
  "50520": "But, if from their birth men and women are placed in a torrid zone, with the meridian sun of pleasure darting directly upon them, how can they sufficiently brace their minds to discharge the duties of life, or even to relish the affections that carry them out of themselves?",
  "50521": "What is the cause of all this?",
  "50522": "What do I seek on the height?",
  "50523": "Have the enemy called in any foreign help?",
  "50524": "Will you believe that she never said a prayer in her life till tonight?",
  "50525": "Lost her memory, eh?",
  "50526": "And pray who are the persons who exhaust your fortune?",
  "50527": "You did not recognise me?",
  "50528": "How shall I break through them?",
  "50529": "That your own bunk over on that side?",
  "50530": "Is this a fact?",
  "50531": "But where, where was this self, this innermost part, this ultimate part?",
  "50532": "What have I to consider?",
  "50533": "Had she succeeded in extracting the secret, and awakening in that adamant heart a last faint touch of pity?",
  "50534": "And will you transfer me to your brother?",
  "50535": "Indeed formerly you were wont to give us some freely, and will you not now let us have any for our money?",
  "50536": "How did it come about, I wonder, that the elder officers are not here to interfere with anything you do?",
  "50537": "Natasha, what is it about?",
  "50538": "I may turn my back on this town a few hours sooner than I intended, but what of that?",
  "50539": "How are they?",
  "50540": "Divide it by three, and what is the result?",
  "50541": "Would I speak to you if he did?",
  "50542": "Where shall I go to find you?",
  "50543": "And the casks?",
  "50544": "Said I, is there here a new world?",
  "50545": "Hamlet's which?",
  "50546": "And suppose some learned traveller should come across these specimens, eh?",
  "50547": "Dare you pretend to rouse him against me?",
  "50548": "Is it possible that you consider the sea to be greater now than formerly?",
  "50549": "Where are your reindeer?",
  "50550": "Why was it I wanted to tell him and did not tell him?",
  "50551": "Have I not a wife?",
  "50552": "What time are you supposed to return?",
  "50553": "Why, what are these doing, who are bent down so much?",
  "50554": "Five pounds?",
  "50555": "But why do you wish to bind yourself?",
  "50556": "Say, is it possible?",
  "50557": "You've bought our inn?",
  "50558": "If he were not only to sink from his highest resolve, but to sink into the hideous fettering of domestic hate?",
  "50559": "Must one not surrender his right when he is unable to recover it?",
  "50560": "Why are you so careful, so tender, of this one wrong and no other?",
  "50561": "How am I to pay them?",
  "50562": "You hear that?",
  "50563": "I hope you will not object to my remaining at home, sir?",
  "50564": "And you have brought him back here?",
  "50565": "Should he speak to her?",
  "50566": "And the first?",
  "50567": "How can one describe a man?",
  "50568": "Do you know what you look like, all together, as you are armed and guarded by your lackeys?",
  "50569": "Besides, if women are educated for dependence, that is, to act according to the will of another fallible being, and submit, right or wrong, to power, where are we to stop?",
  "50570": "Do you believe him to be implicated?",
  "50571": "Now, what are you waiting for?",
  "50572": "Have you got the pipe?",
  "50573": "Is it surprising, that such a tasteless being should rather caress this dog than her children?",
  "50574": "Of how many does it consist?",
  "50575": "How could they learn, how calculate, in the midst of this night?",
  "50576": "What satisfaction could a woman of delicacy promise herself in a union with such a man, when the very artlessness of her affection might appear insipid?",
  "50577": "Are not the two sexes made for one another?",
  "50578": "Are these bears here?",
  "50579": "No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of mine?",
  "50580": "When will he come?",
  "50581": "What misfortune has happened then?",
  "50582": "Were they TO BE or BORN TO BE?",
  "50583": "We haven't the dust to bother us, as the men have, and whoever heard of a horse stepping on a man?",
  "50584": "And how far from the edge of the wood?",
  "50585": "When you get through working your horses this fall, will you turn them out in the snow?",
  "50586": "If it's all wrong, why does he read them?",
  "50587": "Why, said I, are you afraid I should confederate with them to commit a robbery upon my master?",
  "50588": "This famous invention of yours?",
  "50589": "Don't you want any?",
  "50590": "But what are you shouting for?",
  "50591": "Or what is your name?",
  "50592": "Do you mind him only having two noises?",
  "50593": "Was that poetry?",
  "50594": "Have we done?",
  "50595": "Why take less critical utilitarians as the only exponents of the school?",
  "50596": "And where do you find them?",
  "50597": "Should he, on the very threshold of such an errand, be afraid?",
  "50598": "Are you married, or are you not?",
  "50599": "The lamps are right, are they?",
  "50600": "For what purpose is your question?",
  "50601": "No luck for old fellows, then, my sweet bud of the wilderness?",
  "50602": "But didn't you yesterday wear a beard, and long hair, and dust in your hair?",
  "50603": "Did the other boys do so?",
  "50604": "Is it possible to transmit a projectile up to the moon?",
  "50605": "Would you like my carbine?",
  "50606": "You spent that cent I give ye, eh, an' got so much that it made ye sick?",
  "50607": "So you do remember some things?",
  "50608": "Don't you like eggs?",
  "50609": "Off I go where?",
  "50610": "And would not my four months' silence appear to him a tacit acceptance of our situation?",
  "50611": "Pray is your lodger within?",
  "50612": "What is easier, you know?",
  "50613": "What, you must leave?",
  "50614": "But how can I?",
  "50615": "What is it you want, dear grandpapa?",
  "50616": "Why don't you drink it?",
  "50617": "Shall the air never again be lighted with the glare of our guns?",
  "50618": "Had this sphinx his fore paws in crime and his hind paws in authority?",

  "50620": "Was he sure of his man?",
  "50621": "Where is the villain?",
  "50622": "You have already sworn the oath of secrecy and fidelity, and you are aware that the punishment for any breach of it is instant and inevitable death?",
  "50623": "Now what is this?",
  "50624": "Did they try to fight you when you saw 'em?",
  "50625": "Your excellency, how come you to be here?",
  "50626": "Well, then, a horse?",
  "50627": "As valiant as was that other?",
  "50628": "Alas, but that sentence is a puddle, is it not?",
  "50629": "I really, my dear, described to you a manner?",
  "50630": "You pelief, ten, in te possibilty of te odd ?",
  "50631": "Why is man, who was born for society, not yet associated?",

  "50636": "Might I see you sew it up?",
  "50637": "Is he a deputy?",
  "50638": "Do say something more?",
  "50639": "You're not afraid of the snow melting first?",
  "50640": "But how?",
  "50641": "But won't you have some tea?",
  "50642": "I'd be a nice sight, wouldn't I, rowing down the pond in a flat?",
  "50643": "Is it very late, mother?",
  "50644": "How are ye, lads?",
  "50645": "What next, I mean?",
  "50646": "Well why don't you DO it?",
  "50647": "And now, what must we do?",
  "50648": "Will this closet suit you, my brother?",
  "50649": "How could I answer?",
  "50650": "What of that?",
  "50651": "Yet if it doesn't work?",
  "50652": "Is there any particular and special reason for your being unable to do either?",
  "50653": "Why will not the marechal advance me a portion of my patrimony?",
  "50654": "What were you crying for?",
  "50655": "Will you mount?",
  "50656": "Did you never observe, I said, the effect on the mind itself of exclusive devotion to gymnastic, or the opposite effect of an exclusive devotion to music?",
  "50657": "If you were a regular motorman, and had been treated as we've been, you wouldn't want any one to come in and take your place, would you?",
  "50658": "Still attracts a little, eh?",
  "50659": "Did his spirit sink as he approached his dreary home, oppressed with a dark foreboding of what the future should bring forth?",
  "50660": "So you DID get here, after all?",
  "50661": "Early?",
  "50662": "What is it that really happens?",
  "50663": "Equally?",
  "50664": "Whither, then, shall we turn for our conception of man's nature?",
  "50665": "And now, how can I retrace the impression left upon me by that walk under the waters?",
  "50666": "How can she know how much we think of our darling?",
  "50667": "There was an advertisement of yours in the papers this morning?",
  "50668": "A being?",
  "50669": "Will you not come and choose your own beasts tomorrow?",
  "50670": "What can I say on the matter?",
  "50671": "And how was she to divide the guests between the marquee and the parlour?",
  "50672": "Did you get my note?",
  "50673": "Well, then, what can be done?",
  "50674": "Sell them?",
  "50675": "Can't you stop?",
  "50676": "Well, is the plaid dry?",
  "50677": "Will you not follow 'em?",
  "50678": "Weren't you off racing the hills before I got my breath with the start I had seeing you turn on me at all?",
  "50679": "What wonder was it that this spot exercised a strong attraction upon each of us at the moment when we were to turn our backs upon it for good?",
  "50680": "Are all voters true to their high responsibilities?",
  "50681": "What can that matter to him?",
  "50682": "What do you think of her?",
  "50683": "Did she also see slowly, but surely, increasing traces of those long wrinkles on the forehead, those slender serpents that nothing can check?",
  "50684": "But how can I wear ornaments if you, who are the elder sister, will never wear them?",
  "50685": "But what matters that?",
  "50686": "What kind of country should we have to deal with?",
  "50687": "Had the word lost its power, or could the failing eye and weary sense no longer answer to the touch of that mighty inspiration?",
  "50688": "At their age?",
  "50689": "What would therefore be more open to him than to keep her in love with him?",
  "50690": "Not to your ladyship's knowledge, perhaps?",
  "50691": "I hope you are not angry with him?",
  "50692": "Why do you look at the thing, then?",
  "50693": "McNabbs?",
  "50694": "Do you wish me to lend you some?",
  "50695": "Can you use your sails?",
  "50696": "Towards what?",
  "50697": "Could I say a few words with you in the next box?",
  "50698": "But what shall you do with him?",
  "50699": "But can there be any difficulty in proving, that vice and virtue are not matters of fact, whose existence we can infer by reason?",
  "50700": "Since a puff of tobacco can cloud it, shall I follow the fitful fire?",
  "50701": "Why these endless denunciations of morality, metaphysics, and psychology, when the abuse of these sciences, which they do not understand, constitutes their whole system?",
  "50702": "When was that first hateful moment in which she had been conscious of a feeling that clashed with her truth, affection, and gratitude, and had not shaken it from her with horror, as if it had been a loathsome thing?",
  "50703": "She will not take poison and have horrid pains, will she?",
  "50704": "Is that right?",
  "50705": "And yet you will let me perish with hunger?",
  "50706": "Why cannot I speak out?",
  "50707": "And why YOU?",
  "50708": "Are they and we no longer the same men?",
  "50709": "You feel quite at home here again, I dare say?",
  "50710": "Was I laughing?",
  "50711": "Has any thing happened?",
  "50712": "When went he?",
  "50713": "Gone already?",
  "50714": "Does she not share in the general jubilee?",
  "50715": "Is it rational to favor one's neighbor, to be proud of one's native town, which may be a poor sort of a town?",
  "50716": "Which way?",
  "50717": "And did you give it to him?",
  "50718": "What became of the poor woman?",
  "50719": "How could you send me such reports as these?",
  "50720": "Miss me?",
  "50721": "Oh, ciphers is it?",
  "50722": "Had always the headache?",
  "50723": "Can any of them read?",
  "50724": "Have I the pleasure of seeing that gentleman before me?",
  "50725": "When?",
  "50726": "Why do you want water?",
  "50727": "Is she married?",
  "50728": "Is there any such foolish thing in the world, ha?",
  "50729": "By the way, why doesn't he come?",
  "50730": "Did any one of the thirteen colonies entertain such a design or expectation?",
  "50731": "Why, what has happened?",
  "50732": "What soul his future conduct can foresee?",
  "50733": "What praise shall we bestow?",
  "50734": "Well, sir, and what profession are you meant for?",
  "50735": "What man is that?",
  "50736": "You cannot seriously wish me to stay idling at home all day?",
  "50737": "Could you have believed such a thing possible?",
  "50738": "Is that the man?",
  "50739": "Do they take good care of you?",
  "50740": "What about it?",
  "50741": "Then he is here?",
  "50742": "And what do you say to all this?",
  "50743": "Where were you last night?",
  "50744": "Are all the rest of our men gone?",
  "50745": "What disturbs you?",
  "50746": "Have you given her warning for good?",
  "50747": "Ain't there really?",
  "50748": "Truths?",
  "50749": "And did you not bring me to this cave?",
  "50750": "If you, who are the valet, hope for dispensation to commit a crime, shall not I, the friend of your bishop, have dispensation for eating meat at the call of my stomach?",
  "50751": "Would you do me the favour to look at a few specimens of my portrait painting?",
  "50752": "And what is the revolution that we shall cause?",
  "50753": "What the devil have you seen, then?",
  "50754": "Do you travel far?",
  "50755": "Why should you, for a mere passing pleasure, risk the loss of those great powers with which you have been endowed?",
  "50756": "And where are you off to now?",
  "50757": "And what is a portrait of a woman?",
  "50758": "Do you think that excuses his assaulting his passengers?",
  "50759": "How could she have while living such a rough life as this?",
  "50760": "Could I stand against the two?",
  "50761": "To hear you converse, to witness your resignation, one might almost believe that you liked your imprisonment?",
  "50762": "Would he find any demand on the part of his audience for a long series of statements, which to a modern seem to interrupt the story?",
  "50763": "Messala escaped?",
  "50764": "Is that clear?",
  "50765": "There, you hear that?",
  "50766": "I told you I was going out of town?",
  "50767": "Is there anything more you want?",
  "50768": "To have it reported on all sides and wherever you wished to stand well that you were a man of wit?",
  "50769": "Can it be that they will take me too?",
  "50770": "May we examine some of these articles?",
  "50771": "Don't you want to go, papa?",
  "50772": "Who'll drive it across?",
  "50773": "What wine?",
  "50774": "When?",
  "50775": "Just so what is morality but high intelligence?",
  "50776": "If anybody comes on office business, take their messages, and say that the gentleman who attends to that matter isn't in at present, will you?",
  "50777": "Has he not given you rhymes and verses and tricks?",
  "50778": "Who the plague is hurt with all this nonsense?",
  "50779": "You must have observed this trait of character?",
  "50780": "And this is all?",

  "50782": "You haven't got a sister, have you?",
  "50783": "Do you want to dethrone your own father?",
  "50784": "Won't you ride with us for the last time?",
  "50785": "What should YOU be kept by yourself for?",

  "51582": "And we shall answer?",
  "51583": "Am I keeping you?",
  "51584": "But what happened after my departure?",
  "51585": "Do you mind my putting on my waterproof and going to see if she got in?",
  "51586": "Does the crime consist in that relation?",
  "51587": "Why not then seek in the latter, the happiness which he had vainly dreamed of finding in the former?",
  "51588": "Will you ask him if I can see him for a moment?",
  "51589": "What is it that you advise and counsel me to do?",
  "51590": "Has a government, then, no authority over such as these, because they never consented to it, and would esteem the very attempt of such a free choice a piece of arrogance and impiety?",
  "51591": "What are you doing that for?",
  "51592": "Aeneid that so, doctor?",
  "51593": "Do you speak the truth, monsieur?",
  "51594": "What words?",
  "51595": "In that case you will send me to the prison, perhaps?",

  "51606": "In the night?",
  "51607": "Or why would grandfather have been so angry with you?",
  "51608": "Or was it that they understood the answers science gave to these problems in some different, clearer sense than he did?",
  "51609": "Why funny, what is funny?",
  "51610": "Oh, you naughty boy, fie for shame, what do you do so far away from home?",

  "51633": "How, how am I to tell you what I mean?",
  "51634": "Why shouldn't you suffer?",
  "51635": "Why does he call me a screw?",
  "51636": "But what about birth, mother?",
  "51637": "You don't mind my doing that?",
  "51638": "How shall we cross the river?",
  "51639": "Where do you go, my wife?",
  "51640": "Where has he been living all these years?",
  "51641": "A farm?",

  "51648": "Now tell me, what is this large one for?",
  "51649": "Is there not more at stake for us than for him?",
  "51650": "That is to say you can readily distinguish a fortress from a simple fortification, such as is allowed to chatelains or vassals?",
  "51651": "Where was thy mother?",
  "51652": "Whom have you instructed to represent your pretended uncle?",
  "51653": "Doesn't that sound sort of elegant and rich?",
  "51654": "Do you want to go?",
  "51655": "Where did she do that?",
  "51656": "What do you mean by that, my darling boy?",
  "51657": "Where turn for a companion and for some hope?",
  "51658": "What if we are?",
  "51659": "What was the symbolic signification of a hedgehog?",
  "51660": "Can that be possible?",
  "51661": "Why linger ye?",
  "51662": "Would the search for him be difficult, or long?",
  "51663": "How's that for the first water?",
  "51664": "But don't you never find it a little 'eating?",
  "51665": "The traveler who has a lackey?",
  "51666": "Did he go into a frenzy in order to disguise his weakened powers from himself?",
  "51667": "Do widows carry symbols of their deceased children or husbands, and for how long?",
  "51668": "Well, how are you?",

  "51675": "But will you not go up?",
  "51676": "And what is this tree which resembles a little palm?",
  "51677": "And who was it that brought the tidings that snatched them from the jaws of death?",
  "51678": "Shall I have him?",
  "51679": "How is it you don't see?",
  "51680": "I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?",
  "51681": "How should I recover it?",
  "51682": "They'd need have some money, eh?",
  "51683": "Who is he, and where shall I find him?",
  "51684": "How could he get out of it?",
  "51685": "Why are you telling me these horrible stories?",
  "51686": "How did you come to be so observant?",
  "51687": "Where is the wood?",
  "51688": "For if they come in and look about now, you know, they'll find her, and carry her away, and they'll be asking me questions, and I shall say I did it, and then they'll take me away, too, don't you see?",

  "54687": "What did you say?",
  "54688": "And what would he say to the dragon's cousin the serjeant, if the serjeant should be brought upon the field before he was able to escape from it?",
  "54689": "How do you know where to go to?",
  "54690": "To you and myself?",
  "54691": "Now what does this mean?",
  "54692": "What does it matter to you now, in any case?",
  "54693": "Our father?",
  "54694": "Children, who'd like to race the horses with me?",
  "54695": "Never mind, never mind, what does it matter?",
  "54696": "What o'clock was this?",
  "54697": "And would you just throw in a nod when I seem to ask you for it?",
  "54698": "What was he to say?",
  "54699": "And what is your success?",
  "54700": "Isn't it large?",
  "54701": "That's a most puzzling expression for a natural science man, do you understand?",
  "54702": "Was he not made?",
  "54703": "Would an exchange of name be an exchange of rights?",
  "54704": "And have we, any on us, yet come so low as he come?",
  "54705": "At the same place?",
  "54706": "Have you no longer any kind feeling for your father?",
  "54707": "Out, even to me?",
  "54708": "Do you know?",
  "54709": "The tide?",
  "54710": "Did you receive my little note the day before yesterday?",
  "54711": "What sort of a report would they bring of the result?",
  "54712": "And what are you jawing for like that?",
  "54713": "What did you see?",
  "54714": "Going to see the pictures?",
  "54715": "But who should be the executioner?",
  "54716": "And what was that working?",
  "54717": "What are you going to do about him?",
  "54718": "You are not worse, are you?",
  "54719": "Why not go right down now and fix him?",
  "54720": "If I name one fact you don't know, will you give me back my rifle?",
  "54721": "You may have recognized the fumes?",
  "54722": "Oh, what does that matter?",
  "54723": "From whom did you get this?",
  "54724": "Who do you reckon 't is?",
  "54725": "Why did he not break it there, since it is evident that every yard that he carried it increased the risk of someone meeting him?",
  "54726": "Which I took hold of and was merrily asking him what he would take to have it said for my honour that it was of my getting?",
  "54727": "How did it come to be cut like that?",
  "54728": "On the hypothesis of the essential goodness of man, how then is to be explained the monstrous attempt to change the authority of some into nobility and the obedience of others into plebeianism?",
  "54729": "Why do you trample upon dead bodies in this temple?",
  "54730": "Whence have you come?",
  "54731": "And how did it happen?",
  "54732": "What do you consider to be the greatest blessing which you have reaped from your wealth?",
  "54733": "Where got she the strength to resist the impulse?",
  "54734": "Anything I like?",
  "54735": "Micawber?",
  "54736": "Are you a large party?",
  "54737": "What were our feelings at that moment?",
  "54738": "Where are you running to?",
  "54739": "A document?",
  "54740": "Do you not reckon me?",
  "54741": "MATERIALS?",
  "54742": "Will any antiquarian inform us, if possible, why these bones were placed here?",
  "54743": "And what do you call these, my darling?",
  "54744": "As to you, monseigneur?",
  "54745": "And had he any right to ask her for a revelation of feelings which she had evidently intended to withhold from him?",
  "54746": "Which of the three is it?",
  "54747": "What do I say?",
  "54748": "And you heard what he said?",
  "54749": "Will you give them to me?",
  "54750": "Well, and what have you been doing?",
  "54751": "Why are there no daffodils now?",
  "54752": "Is it not a happy feeling?",
  "54753": "Why sacrifice forty?",
  "54754": "Where's that ten cents?",
  "54755": "And if he left off dreaming about you, where do you suppose you'd be?",
  "54756": "With your brother?",
  "54757": "Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy?",
  "54758": "Now, dear, what are your own?",
  "54759": "I suffer from emotion?",
  "54760": "What laws are there for us?",
  "54761": "And shall she have the head she covets?",
  "54762": "Would she go out to work again?",
  "54763": "Where did I disappear to?",
  "54764": "And you have no way to get news of them?",
  "54765": "Again the law?",
  "54766": "Aunt, will you have some beef?",
  "54767": "Saw her?",
  "54768": "But I must know that you love me, mustn't I?",
  "54769": "Shall we get out and try to find the road?",
  "54770": "You found something compromising?",
  "54771": "Do you see this letter?",
  "54772": "The gentleman who receives us?",
  "54773": "Where de debble did you come frum?",
  "54774": "Has my father asked you for money?",
  "54775": "Who are you, that you should question the judgment of the nations and the ages?",
  "54776": "What would they do in that case?",
  "54777": "You have not counted me out as equal to so much land, and calculated on me as a balance at your banker's?",
  "54778": "Do you know what this plant is?",
  "54779": "Was he awake, or was it but a dream?",
  "54780": "I wonder where we can go next?",
  "54781": "Are you thinking, if I'm drunk itself, I'd leave my daughter living single with a little frisky rascal is the like of you?",
  "54782": "And what awaits you if you remain faithful to your oath, and obey the commands given you?",
  "54783": "Sire, have you in the army one regiment on which you can implicitly rely?",
  "54784": "Will it take long?",
  "54785": "What's that pump stopping for?",
  "54786": "But then, why do you repulse me?",
  "54787": "Are you willing?",
  "54788": "Have I any?",
  "54789": "I wish you'd lend me half a sovereign, will you?",
  "54790": "No, really?",
  "54791": "Can't you see those good people, with a totally strange woman bursting into their house?",
  "54792": "Has he left you for another?",
  "54793": "Can we really affect the adversary's will?",
  "54794": "Shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the sea?",
  "54795": "Do you mean to say that if he had found his way up here instead of me, you wouldn't have been a little more blind, and a little more deaf, and a little less flourishing, than you have been?",
  "54796": "Would you say that these, or any similar impertinences which private individuals are supposed to address to their rulers, whether in verse or prose, are well or ill spoken?",
  "54797": "Was it possible for her to forgive him?",
  "54798": "How did late continuators, familiar with the serpents, lions, bulls' heads, crabs, doves, and so forth, on the contemporary shields, keep such picturesque and attractive details out of their new rhapsodies?",
  "54799": "D'you like all that frilly, bunchy stuff at the throat?",
  "54800": "What purpose do they serve?",
  "54801": "Oh is it?",
  "54802": "Were all those dear, sorrowful, valiant, charming or tragic beings merely dreams?",
  "54803": "Is there anything of the feminine gender among them?",
  "54804": "Lodging?",
  "54805": "Not his brother?",
  "54806": "And which of them made this passage?",
  "54807": "Not more?",
  "54808": "Has he been examined by any synod or council?",
  "54809": "Have you any objection to see him in my presence?",
  "54810": "But what about them at home?",
  "54811": "What is the difference between light and the lustre which is seen on the polished surface of opaque bodies?",
  "54812": "Now, ma'am, am I a fool?",
  "54813": "You know who that is?",
  "54814": "Had she left no friends, no relations behind her?",
  "54815": "What are you doing?",
  "54816": "You will, won't you, dear?",
  "54817": "You'll take me as I am, with nothing?",
  "54818": "Things are all right with you then?",
  "54819": "Ought he to turn to the left or to the right?",
  "54820": "Who dares?",
  "54821": "But how did you manage it, little pa?",
  "54822": "Some what?",
  "54823": "Do you give it to me?",
  "54824": "Tell me, are you human, or are you more than human?",
  "54825": "And you have not made her speak?",
  "54826": "Took hold of you?",
  "54827": "Have you not talked long enough to drink?",
  "54828": "How can you be so cruel to me?",
  "54829": "Are you better?",
  "54830": "Who is it that you have fallen in love with, my poor fellow?",
  "54831": "Come, come, who did you think we were when you ran away from us?",
  "54832": "But what do you require of me, then?",
  "54833": "Do you like roses?",
  "54834": "Not just yet?",
  "54835": "Was there ever a loser content with the loss of the game?",
  "54836": "Going?",
  "54837": "What's the colour of their stockings?",
  "54838": "Why do you look at us like that?",
  "54839": "Does his daughter know of the relapse?",
  "54840": "Is it not a pity that people who are bright and clever should so often be exceedingly improper?",
  "54841": "What did it all mean?",
  "54842": "Would you like a little mash?",
  "54843": "And what salary do you ask?",
  "54844": "I s'pose you'll be starting off for college in a fortnight's time?",
  "54845": "But, can they be expected to inspire independent sentiments, whose conduct must be regulated by the cautious prudence that is ever on the watch for preferment?",
  "54846": "Did you see a young lad passing this way in the early morning or the fall of night?",
  "54847": "How can you say so?",
  "54848": "Could inertia of race, on such a scale, be broken up, or take new form?",
  "54849": "And how did he treat you?",
  "54850": "You, dear mamma?",
  "54851": "What line shall you take, then?",
  "54852": "Towards a new sun?",
  "54853": "May I come in, guardian?",
  "54854": "Has he finished his turn?",
  "54855": "Mahotin?",
  "54856": "Yet why did he come?",
  "54857": "There are those sharks now over the side, don't you see they prefer it tough and rare?",
  "54858": "If you decide to go, why shouldn't you go in the same ship?",
  "54859": "Is it as bad as all that?",
  "54860": "How old are you and what's your name?",
  "54861": "Are the others coming out?",
  "54862": "Are you certain that you can afford to part with so much money, and that it is right that it should be so expended?",
  "54863": "Queer notion, wasn't it?",
  "54864": "Was that last night?",
  "54865": "Is my pa in, do you know?",
  "54866": "Is that all?",
  "54867": "Won't you join us?",
  "54868": "Was this ever possible?",
  "54869": "Their hair?",
  "54870": "Did they leave these two industries to themselves?",
  "54871": "Do they by attaching to the soul and inhering in her at last bring her to death, and so separate her from the body ?",
  "54872": "Have you been slightly dazzled at the sudden fusion of my ingots?",
  "54873": "Perhaps you did not like it?",
  "54874": "Did he look in this way?",
  "54875": "To me?",
  "54876": "But, look here, are you a great hand with the ladies?",
  "54877": "Have you?",
  "54878": "Was he a man or only a crosseyed thief an a loafer?",
  "54879": "Is that all the story?",
  "54880": "None of it at all?",
  "54881": "And how do you find home, now you have come back to it?",
  "54882": "Do you suppose you could find any good in a child by whipping him?",
  "54883": "Is it the secret instinct of decaying nature, or the soul's impulsive throb, as immortality draws on?",
  "54884": "Who was the youth he had adopted and who bore so striking a resemblance to him?",
  "54885": "You wouldn't like to marry a small tradesman or a working man, would you?",
  "54886": "And his offence?",
  "54887": "Are you sure you are not making a mistake?",
  "54888": "You mean your papers?",
  "54889": "It is a poor conclusion, is it not?",
  "54890": "It may also be called temperate, and for the same reasons?",
  "54891": "Don't you think agricultural laborers would rather have three acres and a cow than three acres of printed forms and a committee?",
  "54892": "But surely this is somewhat irrelevant?",
  "54893": "Was it very vile to be dragged back here again?",
  "54894": "Can you break an engagement off slowly?",
  "54895": "Do you wish to ruin us outright?",
  "54896": "Any how does she do?",
  "54897": "You called me a creature of civilization, or something, didn't you?",
  "54898": "Neckett's children?",
  "54899": "Safe?",
  "54900": "My friends, why do I wish for peace?",
  "54901": "Won't you even stay for tea?",
  "54902": "Can he speak?",
  "54903": "And why not with you?",
  "54904": "Well, do you like it?",
  "54905": "What was she to do?",
  "54906": "But can you make any sense out of them?",
  "54907": "He was not playing, then?",
  "54908": "Rosamond a sufferer, a labourer, a female apostle?",
  "54909": "Who could grant them?",
  "54910": "What were you saying about being married?",
  "54911": "That's it, ain't it?",
  "54912": "Was he engaged in a struggle with some animal whose retreat he had disturbed?",
  "54913": "But certain, if execution be remiss or blindfold now, and in this particular, what will it be hereafter and in other books?",
  "54914": "Did he sign, too?",
  "54915": "You're not angry with me any more?",
  "54916": "How long will this fuse burn?",
  "54917": "Why do you hesitate?",
  "54918": "How can I ever describe the charm and picturesqueness of that summer life?",
  "54919": "May I write to you?",
  "54920": "This will be your luggage, I suppose?",
  "54921": "How could that bring you?",
  "54922": "But all our praises why should lords engross?",
  "54923": "And what then would you say?",
  "54924": "What is your opinion on the matter?",
  "54925": "Pictures are like wine, and want age, you think?",
  "54926": "Where is the entrance?",
  "54927": "The barricade?",
  "54928": "What is life at all?",
  "54929": "If you please, sir, should I have no brandy nor nothing to give the poor creetur?",
  "54930": "Is he kind to her?",
  "54931": "Who is conducting the prosecution?",
  "54932": "Is it mingled with anger or hate?",
  "54933": "What had he to do, indeed?",
  "54934": "Why, what, madam, does it signify what I think?",
  "54935": "Will it be believed that the night of so brilliant a day was for me a night of anguish and perplexity?",
  "54936": "Is not this an agreeable surprise?",
  "54937": "What can you not understand?",
  "54938": "Yes, but where?",
  "54939": "What did you burn 'em for?",
  "54940": "But you, messieurs, you whom I think it an honor to call my friends, since you have been willing to accept that title, what will become of you in the meantime?",
  "54941": "But what does that signify?",
  "54942": "Has it indeed?",
  "54943": "What do you want, sir?",
  "54944": "How did that help you?",
  "54945": "Let me hear it?",
  "54946": "But then again, what has the whale to say?",
  "54947": "What power?",
  "54948": "Surely he has some opinion?",
  "54949": "Will it be soon?",
  "54950": "Must I, then?",
  "54951": "Do you call that nourishment?",
  "54952": "What WERE these things?",
  "54953": "Polo?",
  "54954": "Does he like the moor?",
  "54955": "What, dares the villain write in such base terms?",
  "54956": "But what can I do?",
  "54957": "You are quite sure?",
  "54958": "Publish what, you unreasonable man?",
  "54959": "And where do you come from?",
  "54960": "What letter do you mean she returned unopened?",
  "54961": "Why should I not stay here?",
  "54962": "Has any modern state as yet succeeded in incorporating in its civil constitution such provisions as will ensure to all classes of its subjects any considerable share in the common good?",
  "54963": "Whence did our servitude commence?",
  "54964": "You insist?",
  "54965": "What's the motive?",
  "54966": "Could he not hinder that, by persuading her out of her system of privation?",
  "54967": "Well, mon cher, what are you doing personally?",
  "54968": "Do you propose to me to do so, D'Artagnan?",
  "54969": "What did he know of himself?",
  "54970": "What is the young lady's name?",
  "54971": "Shall I adventure?",
  "54972": "You won't go either, will you?",
  "54973": "Is that his child?",
  "54974": "Then, sire?",
  "54975": "Object to in them?",
  "54976": "Have you any thing further?",
  "54977": "Why, what do they want with more?",
  "54978": "You would wish a notary to be sent for then?",
  "54979": "Is HE her uncle?",
  "54980": "And is it really so beautiful as they say?",
  "54981": "Do you not see?",
  "54982": "Look?",
  "54983": "Do you understand, officer?",
  "54984": "From your husband?",
  "54985": "And who are you to teach me?",
  "54986": "Don't you expect to see him?",
  "54987": "You went home?",
  "54988": "Is not that stonework?",
  "54989": "You order me to receive his friends, too, I suppose?",
  "54990": "Have you any?",
  "54991": "Why should I stay here alone?",
  "54992": "Is my lord pleased with his escort?",
  "54993": "Who will lead us through the land?",
  "54994": "Is it a holiday?",
  "54995": "But where did he find it?",
  "54996": "Then I am not like him, am I?",
  "54997": "Have I a friend here?",
  "54998": "On an omnibus?",
  "54999": "And for what reason?",
  "55000": "You don't know I quit the seminary?",
  "55001": "And in our opinion the guardians ought to have both these qualities?",
  "55002": "What have they done to my hair?",
  "55003": "Have you ever slept, my friend, in a grove of orange trees in flower?",
  "55004": "But for air to breathe on the road?",
  "55005": "Is not some idea expressed in the act of exhuming the bones after the flesh is decayed ?",
  "55006": "Can I wipe my face now?",
  "55007": "In a game of tennis?",
  "55008": "With what will you save it?",
  "55009": "Cousin, what's the matter?",
  "55010": "May we talk?",
  "55011": "What were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss?",
  "55012": "So much has been said and sung of beautiful young girls, why don't somebody wake up to the beauty of old women?",
  "55013": "Or is it the master who has not understood his dog?",
  "55014": "Will you be improved?",
  "55015": "Are you rich, that you may pay for courtiers?",
  "55016": "Don't you think you are?",
  "55017": "And has not her own avarice been sufficiently punished by the ruin of her own hopes and the loss of the property by which she set so much store?",
  "55018": "Why do you not go back?",
  "55019": "But tell me all about it?",
  "55020": "And why do you mean to do such a horrible thing?",
  "55021": "What do YOU think of what the prince has just been saying?",
  "55022": "What need you fear?",
  "55023": "You say you fear nothing but death?",
  "55024": "Who would believe, that a childish fault should be productive of such melancholy consequences?",
  "55025": "I may order the motor round, mayn't I?",
  "55026": "And my sisters?",
  "55027": "Could the diplomat hold it?",
  "55028": "Would you, therefore, that your physician heal the bodily evil?",
  "55029": "Will you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine wanderer?",
  "55030": "Had something gone wrong with the bank?",
  "55031": "Suppose, for instance, that he should be imprisoned for two months, should he be allowed to return to his living at the expiration of that term?",
  "55032": "What was this universe?",
  "55033": "What million?",
  "55034": "Will you then, in the presence of these two friends, accept me as your future husband, and plight me your vow of truth and love?",
  "55035": "Why are we to love prejudices, merely because they are prejudices?",
  "55036": "Why won't you marry me?",
  "55037": "D'you remember what you said to me the other day?",
  "55038": "And did he take it?",
  "55039": "Did you ever see a crocodile overcome?",
  "55040": "Did you see the nursing home!?",
  "55041": "My friend deceive me?",
  "55042": "Well, my dear, what is it?",
  "55043": "Would you fear to go, perhaps to your death, for this imperilled man?",
  "55044": "Must I go?",
  "55045": "Why speak, when words cannot express what one feels?",
  "55046": "Who is to prevent me?",
  "55047": "Of what was he in pursuit?",
  "55048": "Can you not recognize something undisturbed and peaceful among disturbance and trouble?",
  "55049": "And you, my lord?",
  "55050": "What was behind their competent stare?",
  "55051": "And how did this despatch reach you?",
  "55052": "But how were they to be got at?",
  "55053": "What should I speak to him for?",
  "55054": "Tabooed?",
  "55055": "Not?",
  "55056": "He can't, eh?",
  "55057": "Nor running a chance of arrest?",
  "55058": "Who said I wanted to?",
  "55059": "Impossible?",
  "55060": "But wherefore do I awake this remembrance?",
  "55061": "But why are you going?",
  "55062": "To the left?",
  "55063": "How can it be that he should think otherwise?",
  "55064": "What drives him to it?",
  "55065": "How in the name of reason can I be asked to eat a mutton chop?",
  "55066": "Who knows whether these opacities will not become transparent?",
  "55067": "Eh, what?",
  "55068": "What on earth are you raving about?",
  "55069": "What is it but the worst and last form of intellectualism, this love of yours for passion and the animal instincts?",
  "55070": "But what do you mean?",
  "55071": "With this conviction, would he have left the head apothecary in that town?",
  "55072": "Theatres, evening parties, dinners in town?",
  "55073": "What atonement shall we offer him?",
  "55074": "Does HE suppose that people will pay him only to come and sit with them and go away again?",
  "55075": "Whence could this noise proceed?",
  "55076": "What have you got?",
  "55077": "Are you coming up there now?",
  "55078": "Have you seen 'em lately?",

  "55867": "Convicts?",
  "55868": "Why, then, are you about to betray it to me?",
  "55869": "But even in that case, may he have no object beyond his present station, to which he may sacrifice his independence?",
  "55870": "And powder, and bullets?",
  "55871": "If your husband thinks fit to keep you in the dark over this matter, is it for me, who has only learned the true facts under the pledge of professional secrecy, to tell what he has withheld?",

  "55910": "What pamphlet is this?",
  "55911": "Was it not for these causes that you send for me when the great trouble came?",
  "55912": "May I live with you, and tend upon you as I used to do?",
  "55913": "Will you unclasp your hand?",
  "55914": "Wasn't you bad enough when you threw all the money away, so you had to go an' do this just when we was in awful trouble?",

  "55929": "What else could I look for, being what I am, and leading such a life as mine?",
  "55930": "Why didn't you come to dinner?",
  "55931": "Where is this poor giant, or this poor wretch of a vanquished knight, to find her?",

  "55937": "My father is well, is he not?",
  "55938": "Was it going farther from, or nearing, the disc?",
  "55939": "How is this?",
  "55940": "Recollect, my lord, if he did not say something a little like that to you?",
  "55941": "Is he really her cousin, as he says?",
  "55942": "Who's to prevent me?",
  "55943": "Why dig up the pestilence from the pit in which it is buried?",

  "55950": "No, why should you?",
  "55951": "What can I do sir?",
  "55952": "Should I have remained in that house, near you and them, if I did not love them?",
  "55953": "And this letter?",
  "55954": "What d'you charge for a ride, boss?",
  "55955": "What is the matter?",
  "55956": "And if it be so, what is it?",
  "55957": "Mother, what are you crying for?",
  "55958": "Were I to allow you to march out, what security can I have that you will not join them, and afterwards fight against me?",
  "55959": "Reinforcements?",
  "55960": "What would it be right to do?",
  "55961": "What's up with you?",
  "55962": "Should it ever be said that he had robbed those old men, whom he so truly and so tenderly loved in his heart of hearts?",
  "55963": "What made you think he'd ceased to take any interest in the case?",
  "55964": "Is it anything I have done that has pulled you down like that?",
  "55965": "What could my father mean by sending me to be an inmate in this strange family?",
  "55966": "You mean you'll have no quarrel with me?",
  "55967": "Was he awake or was he asleep?",
  "55968": "Well, but if I bought the mill, and allowed your husband to act as my manager in the same way, how then?",
  "55969": "What am I to do if I love him and the other one too?",
  "55970": "And have you come from far like this?",
  "55971": "And what did I tell 'ee?",
  "55972": "Could she, who had been so active in the getting up of the funeral triumph, do less than exult?",
  "55973": "Who now will tell the ladies that I would hie me thither?",
  "55974": "What is genius?",
  "55975": "You have taken care, I hope, of the casket I sent you to lock up?",
  "55976": "What evils?",
  "55977": "And is it wounded?",
  "55978": "What recollections of boyhood and innocence might have been flitting across his brain?",
  "55979": "What noise is that?",
  "55980": "No dignity in whaling?",
  "55981": "Why could they not wait a little?",
  "55982": "No apology, I suppose?",
  "55983": "What are you thinking of?",
  "55984": "How have I offended?",
  "55985": "Why should we be unable to preserve a remembrance of them?",
  "55986": "There is something else you wanted to say?",
  "55987": "Was I not right in saying at the outset that, relatively to the tax, we are behind our institutions?",
  "55988": "What charge, sir?",
  "55989": "Did you see no one?",
  "55990": "Ah, now, couldn't you take me with you?",
  "55991": "Oh, may I get this rose?",
  "55992": "He asked me whether I would go with him?",
  "55993": "A'n't you getting all you hoped for, ay, and more than you hoped for?",
  "55994": "Why did you leave him on the road?",
  "55995": "And in such a case what is one to say?",
  "55996": "But as I am not bound to give in to your plans, any more than you are compelled to submit to mine, may I ask to know if you have formed any which depend on my assistance?",
  "55997": "Yes, why?",
  "55998": "To which of us?",
  "55999": "Could we not break it?",
  "56000": "What does he drink?",
  "56001": "But however are you going to race in this mud?",
  "56002": "Is this the part of wise men, engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty?",
  "56003": "Cannot you describe her?",
  "56004": "And that which is not more or less a harmony is not more or less harmonized?",
  "56005": "A joke?",
  "56006": "What is his folly?",
  "56007": "I must, then, remain here?",
  "56008": "Who were they?",
  "56009": "Mercenary, mem?",
  "56010": "Well then, my dear, why don't you praise the neatness and prettiness with which it's kept?",
  "56011": "Have you not read in my eyes that there is nothing but devotion and sympathy in my heart?",
  "56012": "Is that worth talking about and making so much ado?",
  "56013": "When are you starting?",
  "56014": "You want no treasures and no castles?",
  "56015": "You will live on our selection, won't you?",
  "56016": "He wouldn't have so much influence, then, don't you reckon?",
  "56017": "Now then, gentlemen, shall I break the seal or not?",
  "56018": "It must have been on the boulevard?",
  "56019": "Could a statue of marble have been more impassive and more mute?",
  "56020": "Would you like to?",
  "56021": "Do you call yourself a raw country girl?",
  "56022": "And, then, do you think that my stumps are pretty?",
  "56023": "But do you fail to live?",
  "56024": "Sure it's he?",
  "56025": "Whose fault?",
  "56026": "She has formed no other attachment?",
  "56027": "What matter?",
  "56028": "And wherefore has he not been to see me?",
  "56029": "Shall we really try it?",
  "56030": "Doth any praise himself?",
  "56031": "I tried to decline taking the guinea on the first occasion, but with no better effect than causing her to ask me very angrily, if I expected more?",
  "56032": "Now, then, where's the first boy?",
  "56033": "What has age to do with it?",
  "56034": "What besides?",
  "56035": "Separate, my dear?",
  "56036": "Isn't it a most wonderful and extraordinary thing that I can't call at a man's house but I find a piece of this poor surgeon's friend on the staircase?",
  "56037": "Now, why don't you take my advice?",
  "56038": "Do you wish I hadn't come?",
  "56039": "And alone?",
  "56040": "Why should I pull her into it?",
  "56041": "No cheering news, then?",
  "56042": "And with what object?",
  "56043": "Monks would never learn how you knew what you do?",
  "56044": "What do you keep SAYING you will for?",
  "56045": "Was it so?",
  "56046": "But the earl?",
  "56047": "Do you see, now, one reason why I have let you go thus early into the world?",
  "56048": "Will you show me your plan?",

  "56052": "Bast?",
  "56053": "What was it you wanted to ask, sir?",
  "56054": "Did you ever hear such a name?",
  "56055": "Can it attack it beneath the waves?",
  "56056": "Are we to expect nothing but chivalric tenderness and compassion from men who made war on a tolerant government to make more secure their barbaric system of oppression?",
  "56057": "If we had to keep account of our amours, we should be just as embarrassed as this cytisus which you apostrophized would be in counting up his descendants, should we not?",
  "56058": "To those who love as ourselves, in what respect differs a year from an hour?",
  "56059": "And you think that just?",
  "56060": "You will start at once?",
  "56061": "To what point of the continent?",

  "56068": "Her voice when she talked to them?",
  "56069": "Would the militia, in this supposition, be more ready or more able to support the federal authority than in the case of a general union?",
  "56070": "Is he in favor of all these things at once?",
  "56071": "How are they represented, whose very sweat supports the splendid stud of an heir apparent, or varnishes the chariot of some female favourite who looks down on shame?",
  "56072": "Or show you restless, miswandering, misclimbing ones, new and easier footpaths?",
  "56073": "Do you think the thing possible?",
  "56074": "Is the door shut?",
  "56075": "But what will you do?",
  "56076": "Well, then, have you any better plan to propose?",
  "56077": "What, have you a wife, then?",
  "56078": "But does nothing depend on it for them?",
  "56079": "You are well?",
  "56080": "You do love me still?",
  "56081": "Where do your excellencies wish to go?",
  "56082": "Then what the devil brought you here, being a churchman?",
  "56083": "You know what to beautify is, I suppose?",
  "56084": "How can I commit such treachery?",
  "56085": "And what is it doing in the world?",
  "56086": "Do you know, sir?",
  "56087": "And what does it amount to, after all?",
  "56088": "By his son, sir?",
  "56089": "But how, madame?",
  "56090": "What course is that?",
  "56091": "What did the gardener say?",

  "56094": "But what is thy name?",
  "56095": "Ma foi, what rival?",
  "56096": "An't that as nat'ral as walking, and as good for the health?",
  "56097": "Do I then strive after HAPPINESS?",
  "56098": "One should never admit anything in electioneering matters, should one?",
  "56099": "Is she game for that?",
  "56100": "Is it void of understanding?",
  "56101": "And who dictated it?",
  "56102": "Was it not this?",
  "56103": "Who's there?",
  "56104": "What next, I wonder?",

  "56106": "But what of that, so long as it tickles the palate more strongly?",
  "56107": "Is the sea not full of green islands?",
  "56108": "Whence then this obvious DISQUALITY?",
  "56109": "There is a deficit, you say?",

  "56131": "And what will that signify to me?",
  "56132": "Why will you be silent?",
  "56133": "How then stands the case?",
  "56134": "And you think it funny, no doubt?",
  "56135": "What is gentleness?",
  "56136": "Do you wish this change so very much, sir?",
  "56137": "Do you think I can teach a small school?",
  "56138": "What can I do, my son?",

  "56143": "And so the doctor walked, backwards and forwards through the garden, slowly, thinking now with some earnestness what if, after all, he had been wrong about his niece?",
  "56144": "Well, fwiend?",
  "56145": "And papa's written consent?",
  "56146": "How could he have been so forgetful?",
  "56147": "And taking it as a story, what do you think of it?",
  "56148": "Can he be afraid of this boy?",
  "56149": "How about returning?",
  "56150": "Don't you mean the composition pedals?",
  "56151": "Well, what is there surprising in that?",
  "56152": "Do you see any objection?",
  "56153": "I wonder when he got the message?",

  "56163": "So you're in the washing business, ma'am?",
  "56164": "And I am to hide my guilt, as I have done so many years?",
  "56165": "Pray what was his offence?",
  "56166": "Was it possible he had deceived himself so utterly about her?",
  "56167": "What was it you put on that chair near the window?",
  "56168": "Who else is it?",

  "56625": "Well, cousin, are you ready to go to meeting?",
  "56626": "And because we think right to destroy you, do you think that you have any right to destroy us in return, and your country as far as in you lies?",
  "56627": "How long will we be gone?",
  "56628": "Where could they commence a fresh quest?",
  "56629": "We must recollect that the individual in whom the several qualities of his nature do their own work will be just, and will do his own work?",
  "56630": "Who is it?",
  "56631": "And your order?",
  "56632": "Then you do not require me to pay?",
  "56633": "I suppose all these things may remain here?",
  "56634": "Where are you going?",
  "56635": "Who can look on 't, sir, and fairly tell a man 'tis not a muddle?",
  "56636": "I don't bother you, do I?",
  "56637": "Did the veteran make himself disastrously felt in the leader?",
  "56638": "Upon what should he decide?",
  "56639": "Why not do it?",
  "56640": "Are they what?",
  "56641": "Has not this dead man whom you have just helped to bury, taught you the vanity of human affairs?",
  "56642": "And why should he not have this?",
  "56643": "What did he do?",
  "56644": "But was it the candy man?",
  "56645": "This is quite an adventure, isn't it?",
  "56646": "Did you go into these houses with her?",
  "56647": "What is a piece of money, in fact?",
  "56648": "What'll you take for him?",
  "56649": "Are they real existences?",
  "56650": "Remove the eye of authority and where are you?",
  "56651": "And is such a girl to be my nephew's sister?",
  "56652": "What promise?",
  "56653": "Oh, what shall I do?",
  "56654": "The queen asked him if he had forgotten who it was he was speaking to?",
  "56655": "But what would have become of our story and all our friends, then?",
  "56656": "Beg your pardon, sir?",
  "56657": "How can you call it a GOOD night when you know it must be the very worst night I've ever had?",
  "56658": "You don't like the water?",
  "56659": "Then why the devil don't you dine?",
  "56660": "I've provided for men and shipmates times enough, but I'm as ignorant as a child how many glasses of grog a woman, that's not a drinking woman, is expected to consume at these ceremonies?",
  "56661": "Why was some one so anxious to get possession of it?",
  "56662": "Why, child?",
  "56663": "What are the restless wretches doing now?",
  "56664": "What do you feel?",
  "56665": "But why do you copy it?",
  "56666": "Was it you, then, I saw under the willow tree the other night?",
  "56667": "How could you be so cruel?",
  "56668": "And what do you do now, you pernicious villains?",
  "56669": "What will he do with the third?",
  "56670": "What did you ask her?",
  "56671": "You will be satisfied with it?",
  "56672": "Why destroy me?",
  "56673": "What is it, monseigneur?",
  "56674": "Good heavens, what are you telling me?",
  "56675": "Do you remember when he did this?",
  "56676": "Find him?",
  "56677": "Isn't it just a proof of her blessed innocence?",
  "56678": "Is that you, miserable wretch?",
  "56679": "What were we talking about?",
  "56680": "Come, what do they say about the new act I have got passed in the council?",
  "56681": "Where were you last night?",
  "56682": "Is that what you affirm?",
  "56683": "But what could she say or do?",
  "56684": "I hope you want nothing?",
  "56685": "And joy, the joy of the theatre, would that, too, be taken away?",
  "56686": "Why not tonight?",
  "56687": "Was he mad, then, as well as blind, that he talked to himself?",
  "56688": "And is there naught to show that man dwells there?",
  "56689": "Was it to everyone?",
  "56690": "Shall I tell you my guess?",
  "56691": "How do you prepare it for eating?",
  "56692": "And is not this daughter dead?",
  "56693": "Come, what's the matter, old fellow?",
  "56694": "Sblood, let them keep themselves, they are no sheep, are they?",
  "56695": "Do you see that you have given offence?",
  "56696": "Why did you leave them?",
  "56697": "What do you allude to?",
  "56698": "But what is it?",
  "56699": "Have you none of your own?",
  "56700": "But what would induce them to rise in insurrection, when they are so happy and contented as you have described?",
  "56701": "Will you buy it, my dear?",
  "56702": "What more do you want?",
  "56703": "But why?",
  "56704": "If monarchy is a useless thing, why is it kept up anywhere?",
  "56705": "Five?",
  "56706": "Get my note?",
  "56707": "Who could want me?",
  "56708": "Don't look like the sort of one to get any, do he?",
  "56709": "I wish to know whether you desire this arrangement or whether you do not?",
  "56710": "Is it the story he would not understand, or the storyteller?",
  "56711": "Would not one of these have served?",
  "56712": "Are you thinking them's his boots?",
  "56713": "Can't you leave me alone?",
  "56714": "For the purpose of making investigations there?",
  "56715": "I ask you where are you going, you villain?",
  "56716": "And if it is still empty?",
  "56717": "Or in case we prefer neither of them, but successively assent to both, as is usual among philosophers, with what confidence can we afterwards usurp that glorious title, when we thus knowingly embrace a manifest contradiction?",
  "56718": "But are you under the impression that you have so great a mind that you can understand the most profound writer at a first reading?",
  "56719": "Do you like sitting alone?",
  "56720": "Such a revelation, do you say?",
  "56721": "Then why are they sent out?",
  "56722": "But after all, what is it?",
  "56723": "What is the matter with him today?",
  "56724": "Of course, you will stop and take your midday meal with me?",
  "56725": "Why are the bass strings loaded with coils of wire?",
  "56726": "Kryltzoff, it's true that the doctor has prescribed cough mixture for me, is it not?",
  "56727": "If everything's so all right what is there to make up for?",
  "56728": "Cake?",
  "56729": "Was there no one else to pay for you?",
  "56730": "Come, what is your competence?",
  "56731": "And that those who are never improper should so often be dull and heavy?",
  "56732": "Will you speak for me?",
  "56733": "Had not you better sell them?",
  "56734": "How do things go aboard?",
  "56735": "You understand me?",
  "56736": "Too proud?",
  "56737": "Your presentiments?",
  "56738": "Why not?",
  "56739": "Where are your papers?",
  "56740": "Whose fault is that?",
  "56741": "Why, what did you call it yesterday, then, leaving your sister's house in a tantrum?",
  "56742": "Is reason, then, synonymous with intelligence?",
  "56743": "What is there to say to such a question?",
  "56744": "What should be our attitude toward separate schools?",
  "56745": "How is it they don't take proper precautions?",
  "56746": "Don't you want to see it?",
  "56747": "Or is it to be decided by your own laws, by your own rules of judicature?",
  "56748": "Do you see that brooch?",
  "56749": "You were there the next morning about noon?",
  "56750": "Why did you not tell me that you contemplated ambushing those fellows?",
  "56751": "The littlest key?",
  "56752": "Why should he turn like this?",
  "56753": "Now, what call have you to say that?",
  "56754": "You do, do you?",
  "56755": "If it is useless, are they poorer?",
  "56756": "You don't understand?",
  "56757": "Why must you?",
  "56758": "Now, will you?",
  "56759": "But have you tried?",
  "56760": "What more did he ask you?",
  "56761": "Does not this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practical resolution in facing death?",
  "56762": "Everybody liked her, didn't they?",
  "56763": "Appears against the boy, does he?",
  "56764": "Shall I serve them up?",
  "56765": "What hotel is he stopping at?",
  "56766": "You know that your aunt believes you will go back?",
  "56767": "Who are you?",
  "56768": "I hope you don't suppose there's anybody here who is to prevent my talking as I like?",
  "56769": "Can any one doubt as to the reason of it?",
  "56770": "But you will not mind for one evening, dear?",
  "56771": "You have been ill?",
  "56772": "But what could a ball do against the scaly armour with which these enormous beasts were clad?",
  "56773": "Saturday?",
  "56774": "Why may not I take sword and indulge the passion of war?",
  "56775": "Whence can this come to me?",
  "56776": "I suppose the young lady is not up yet?",
  "56777": "WHY DID MAMMA CHANGE HER MIND?",
  "56778": "Why had he been afraid?",
  "56779": "Shall I ask?",
  "56780": "Turn away?",
  "56781": "And in what manner has this congeniality of mind been evinced?",
  "56782": "How can anyone possibly receive such a man as I am?",
  "56783": "The peasants are rioting, and you can't manage them?",
  "56784": "Is it from mere humanity you bid me live?",
  "56785": "Don't you want anything?",
  "56786": "Is it alive?",
  "56787": "You can bear a little more?",
  "56788": "The next question was, who should reign?",
  "56789": "What is there on the reverse side of the picture?",
  "56790": "What can bring her here so often?",
  "56791": "How dare you insult me thus?",
  "56792": "Who was it got them to give him a lift?",
  "56793": "What proof had he of this?",
  "56794": "Escaped?",
  "56795": "Where?",
  "56796": "Any person mentioned?",
  "56797": "Now again, I ask if you have anything to say to me?",
  "56798": "Why should a greater manifestation choose more limited forms in preference to those of others?",
  "56799": "Where'll I hide my poor body from that ghost of hell?",
  "56800": "But are the beasts as wise as the men?",
  "56801": "How can his little head carry all thy long talk?",
  "56802": "Have you forgotten?",
  "56803": "Who, or from whence?",
  "56804": "Do you not think, earl, that this will be an amusing spectacle, and one refreshing to the heart, to see how the tiger and dove struggle with each other?",
  "56805": "But can't we have one last night more?",
  "56806": "If you think it's so lovely, why don't you go and see it yourself?",
  "56807": "You noticed that I didn't breathe a word as to the purpose of our visit?",
  "56808": "How am I?",
  "56809": "And who that considers the weight of the burden on this man's back, will say that the prayer was an improper one?",
  "56810": "What is the good of making him inhale ammonia and all that parcel of drugs?",
  "56811": "Why should you not be there?",
  "56812": "How on earth am I to tell her that I am a respectable, engaged member of society and it's all over between us?",
  "56813": "And you have it still?",
  "56814": "And how do you know it?",
  "56815": "Shall I be baffled thus?",
  "56816": "Should she unclasp it, should she not?",
  "56817": "Why were they keeping him pent up in this narrow crate?",
  "56818": "Wher' you bound for, young man?",
  "56819": "It is ignominious to feel poor, isn't it?",
  "56820": "Shall we?",
  "56821": "Tell you?",
  "56822": "We are going backwards?",
  "56823": "Do you hear me say he struck me?",
  "56824": "Do you call that LESS?",
  "56825": "Can it be he?",
  "56826": "Why do I tell myself lies?",
  "56827": "But does he therefore confer no benefit when he works for nothing?",
  "56828": "Had he not saved her, and was he not entitled to this honour?",
  "56829": "Is it in property?",
  "56830": "But how was I to write?",
  "56831": "We ought to think of it, oughtn't we?",
  "56832": "Couldn't we take a ride on the top of a tram?",
  "56833": "Are you glad, papa?",
  "56834": "Suppose her majesty refuses?",
  "56835": "Oh, you be, be you?",
  "56836": "Tell me, do you think the number of your company is greater than mine?",
  "56837": "Yet, how can boys be expected to treat an usher with respect when the master seems to consider him in the light of a servant, and almost to countenance the ridicule which becomes the chief amusement of the boys during the play hours?",
  "56838": "Sure of what?",
  "56839": "Would you like to give me a kiss for a poem?",
  "56840": "Will you not bring me a little water?",
  "56841": "What are you all thinking about?",
  "56842": "How could a woman be a tower of ivory or a house of gold?",
  "56843": "How is a mere girl, saving your presence, to do this at all?",
  "56844": "About the property?",
  "56845": "Is it possible the king could have condescended so far as to express himself so favorably of me?",
  "56846": "Is there any wrong you consider I've done you?",
  "56847": "Who gave you leave to do so?",
  "56848": "Was I right to play the part, or wrong to play the part?",
  "56849": "Not bad news, I hope?",
  "56850": "Could I seek to woo, and rivet to myself forever, the entire and virgin affections of another while there was a possibility that I might compare and regret?",
  "56851": "Do you think I could suffer more?",
  "56852": "Why are there so many unpaid certificates in almost every man's hands, but from the parsimony of not providing sufficient revenues?",
  "56853": "Could it ever have been imagined that the correspondence of the army, to whom he addressed this proclamation, teemed with accusations against him?",
  "56854": "Can you understand this monstrous punishment, this slow, perpetual laceration of a mother's heart, this abominable, endless waiting?",
  "56855": "Don't you know that all the world is talking about you?",
  "56856": "Of what importance, then, is the materiality of the punishment?",
  "56857": "What can we do to save him?",
  "56858": "Have you experienced it?",
  "56859": "'Twas at that I caught 'ee once, if you can mind?",
  "56860": "What, naturally, in the way of the priceless, hasn't she got?",
  "56861": "Had the hour of adversity come?",
  "56862": "Do you mean to say he has the presumption to hope to pass from intendant to superintendent?",
  "56863": "Tell me how?",
  "56864": "What did it taste like?",
  "56865": "Why should we disappear and give place to others, when we may still, if we choose, remain in the front rank and lead the battle?",
  "56866": "Little one, what is thy name?",
  "56867": "What have you done?",
  "56868": "How will the document read?",
  "56869": "But why in the world do these look upon the ground?",
  "56870": "Mayn't her reasons be a dislike, beautifully founded, of the presence, and thereby of the observation, of persons who perhaps know about her things it's inconvenient to her they should know?",
  "56871": "How do you pig together?",
  "56872": "But what brings you here?",
  "56873": "Am I not a true friend?",
  "56874": "What's the wages?",
  "56875": "You aren't too hot?",
  "56876": "What business?",
  "56877": "Is the spot far from here?",
  "56878": "Smells?",
  "56879": "Don't you like limes?",
  "56880": "Wasn't this consensus literally their only way not to be ungracious?",
  "56881": "Who was it, man or maid, that laid it there?",
  "56882": "What is there yet in a sonne?",
  "56883": "The inevitable?",
  "56884": "And if he was invis'ble, and the bears invis'ble, who knows that they really ate him up?",
  "56885": "What did you mean to complain of today?",
  "56886": "What do you mean by letting any one in here?",
  "56887": "But is it a just idea?",
  "56888": "What if the chains should break under its enormous weight?",
  "56889": "Of wanting to?",
  "56890": "Please, am I to keep it?",
  "56891": "Why hate him, therefore?",
  "56892": "Where is the residence part?",
  "56893": "Who shall have it?",
  "56894": "I could see that the passage was continued, but where did it lead?",
  "56895": "Nor bear thyself the bleeding trophy home?",
  "56896": "Which way is he gone?",
  "56897": "Are you going home?",
  "56898": "And what were the reforms of which we speak?",
  "56899": "It was a good trick you played on us last year?",
  "56900": "How are we to feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even for ourselves?",
  "56901": "Is it doubted that it would restore the national authority and national prosperity and perpetuate both indefinitely?",
  "56902": "You've a mouth, haven't you?",
  "56903": "How much is it worth?",
  "56904": "And do you find it interesting?",
  "56905": "Why can't I 'ave that?",
  "56906": "Where have you been lodged?",
  "56907": "Do any of them seem to care about my not being there?",
  "56908": "Can you?",
  "56909": "To what do you refer?",
  "56910": "What do you say of that young man?",
  "56911": "Of the three individuals, which has the greatest experience of all the pleasures which we enumerated?",
  "56912": "Why did you not wait for me, sir, to escort me downstairs?",
  "56913": "What can you do?",
  "56914": "Would you like to go into my study?",
  "56915": "Have you not taken a bastion?",
  "56916": "You wish to speak to me alone?",
  "56917": "Passepartout?",
  "56918": "Who said that you were to go away?",
  "56919": "And, if he did not assist her, who would do so?",
  "56920": "So you're not afraid of getting fat?",
  "56921": "What regiment is that, and where are you going?",
  "56922": "What science can there be in a matter in which, as in all practical matters, nothing can be defined and everything depends on innumerable conditions, the significance of which is determined at a particular moment which arrives no one knows when?",
  "56923": "Well, and what have you to say to me?",
  "56924": "Did you not?",
  "56925": "Am I taken prisoner or have I taken him prisoner?",
  "56926": "Do you think that a good man and a bad must share the same fate, and alike die, and end?",
  "56927": "Does it matter?",
  "56928": "What do you go for, then?",
  "56929": "It's almost enough to make us get married after all, isn't it?",
  "56930": "How do you feel now, my love?",
  "56931": "What is this, then?",
  "56932": "Did you want him too to go sailing about amid all kinds of hardship while others are eating up his estate?",
  "56933": "Why don't you go to a hospital?",
  "56934": "You do like it?",
  "56935": "Isn't that a perfectly elegant name?",
  "56936": "And now you know all that you want to know, do you not?",
  "56937": "What's the matter with the man that he isn't good enough for you?",
  "56938": "How should he dare to seek the bottom of it?",
  "56939": "Will you do me that favour?",
  "56940": "Will power, which has received numerous complaints upon this subject, intervene to restore competition and prevent monopoly?",
  "56941": "Can anybody lend me a shilling?",
  "56942": "In what way did you go thither?",
  "56943": "Well, what do you want me to do?",
  "56944": "You know something about him, do you not, madame?",
  "56945": "Beastly, isn't it?",
  "56946": "Presumed?",
  "56947": "Is it all right?",
  "56948": "Can they go on, my father?",
  "56949": "Shall we go on upstairs?",
  "56950": "Or is this a season to revel in?",
  "56951": "You've j'ined a college by this time, I suppose?",
  "56952": "And exactly the same thing happened to both of you?",
  "56953": "You don't understand?",
  "56954": "Shall we follow you?",
  "56955": "Why not exclude every man convicted of any degrading legal crime, even petty larceny?",
  "56956": "But advocates and proctors are not one and the same?",
  "56957": "You surely do not mean to let the child dine at eight o'clock?",
  "56958": "Well, what are we to do?",
  "56959": "I hope you won't dislike the trouble of all this?",
  "56960": "By whom can he have been instigated?",
  "56961": "You won't care to stay at home now, perhaps?",
  "56962": "What sort of games are you up to?",
  "56963": "Has he taken off his doublet?",
  "56964": "Have you a sumptuous table, a dashing wife, and gold to scatter, in order to attract them to your suite?",
  "56965": "Did I not understand you to say that, as the consequence of the collision, the character of the comet's orbit has been changed?",
  "56966": "Why, too, should he write a letter now, rather than six years ago?",
  "56967": "All ready?",
  "56968": "Might she have loved me?",
  "56969": "What can you do then?",
  "56970": "Your daughter?",
  "56971": "But where is she?",
  "56972": "But can this be possible?",
  "56973": "No, you do not, do you?",
  "56974": "What help do you want from me?",
  "56975": "Tell me at once that I want to assassinate you?",
  "56976": "Is it not those very persons who mourn for him?",
  "56977": "Did you ever know anybody who was born to it besides myself?",
  "56978": "The first?",
  "56979": "Will he continue, then, to keep our secret?",
  "56980": "Aren't we going to stay here?",
  "56981": "Have I changed so much?",
  "56982": "All your naughty purposes, I make no doubt, were quite changed?",
  "56983": "Despair?",
  "56984": "What does that mean?",
  "56985": "SHALL I TURN THE SCORPION?",
  "56986": "No letter that can possibly have been overlooked?",
  "56987": "Now, father, may I marry my lass?",
  "56988": "Can I, in a theatre, occupy at the same time one place in the pit, another in the boxes, and a third in the gallery?",
  "56989": "Are we not now in her pursuit?",
  "56990": "You will let me help, will you not?",
  "56991": "How can I expect to convince you, if you cannot tell robbery when I show it to you?",
  "56992": "And number three?",
  "56993": "How could I help it?",
  "56994": "What would the minister have said, mother?",
  "56995": "Plague on't, my lord, have you brought me here to get my horoscope out of me?",
  "56996": "Do you suppose that I am afraid to die?",
  "56997": "How many all told?",
  "56998": "What letters?",
  "56999": "Will it not be better that she should keep the resentment of the insult for ever?",
  "57000": "What could be the cause of this phenomenon?",
  "57001": "Or whether it eats and drinks?",
  "57002": "But what would you say in it?",
  "57003": "May I go up and speak to her?",

  "59153": "What's to prevent our having a person that we CAN depend upon, and enjoying the delight of doing a good action at the same time?",
  "59154": "Really, then?",
  "59155": "Practise meditation?",
  "59156": "If you'll forgive my leaving you now?",
  "59157": "Could you have a motive for the trust, that was not honourable and flattering to me?",
  "59158": "How could springs break through such walls as these?",
  "59159": "No, why disturb the old fellow?",
  "59160": "Why shouldn't I go?",
  "59161": "And now did it all end in those ravings of hate, and in that glazing gaze of terror?",
  "59162": "And what about the green mist?",
  "59163": "Where did you put it?",
  "59164": "Now, my friends, are any of you obtuse enough to swallow that?",
  "59165": "Do I perceive the whereabouts of the coach which I hear rattling by my window, or does reasoning play its part in giving me information?",

  "59194": "What was his life?",
  "59195": "Why can't I go?",
  "59196": "What generally?",
  "59197": "Shall the despair of success make me assert, that I am here possest of an idea, which is not preceded by any similar impression?",
  "59198": "But wherefore all this labour, all this strife?",
  "59199": "It is rather, isn't it?",
  "59200": "What is this folly?",
  "59201": "And after that?",

  "59248": "May I ask you to be so good as to leave this room?",
  "59249": "What do you see in her out of the way?",
  "59250": "Do you mean to insinuate I've got toes, you unnatural wretch?",
  "59251": "Do you yet doubt?",
  "59252": "Shall I give you an illustration?",
  "59253": "And have you those excellent receipts, madam, to keep yourselves from bearing of children?",

  "59266": "Of course, sir, you will begin soon to educate your son yourself?",
  "59267": "Did you observe any thing peculiar about it?",
  "59268": "If the act is not repealed, what do you think will be the consequences?",
  "59269": "Is it too late?",
  "59270": "Is it true?",
  "59271": "Would you deal lighter blows rather than heavier ones?",
  "59272": "Will you allow me to live there with them?",
  "59273": "What can you possibly want to know of circuses then?",
  "59274": "Have you got through all your work?",
  "59275": "And now will this attempt, unprecedented in the annals of travels, lead to any practical result?",
  "59276": "What portion awaited those enemies?",

  "59283": "But who may abide the day of his appearing?",
  "59284": "In falsetto?",
  "59285": "Will the best of those we bade come hither to this land?",
  "59286": "Think I'm afraid of such as you?",
  "59287": "But you, gentlemen, then, have never heard the catastrophe of the BRITANNIA, mentioned?",
  "59288": "Yes?",
  "59289": "Are you dying for him?",
  "59290": "You are not so bewitched, ma'am, are you, as to remain with him of your own accord?",
  "59291": "Did it lie in some tangled depth of philosophy?",
  "59292": "Who said that?",
  "59293": "In what place, sir?",
  "59294": "Will you not embrace it?",
  "59295": "Can you tell me where I could get employment of any kind?",
  "59296": "But what is temptation?",

  "59304": "Do you believe that he thinks of it much?",
  "59305": "Is this carriage for me?",
  "59306": "But what about her husband?",
  "59307": "Has the latter a right to prevent D from selling?",
  "59308": "Then, who taught you?",
  "59309": "You are happy?",
  "59310": "Before the end of the week?",
  "59311": "You say?",
  "59312": "How would ye rise high, if your fathers' will should not rise with you?",
  "59313": "Did you really think I was the kind of girl to roll about on the floor and whine for mercy?",
  "59314": "And again I ask, what is all this labor to do for you?",
  "59315": "You didn't suppose you were going away from me, did you?",
  "59316": "Say you so?",

  "60862": "How are you going?",
  "60863": "Shall we preserve and transmit it to posterity?",
  "60864": "And should he, by an impression on the minds of his creatures, think fit to impart to them some event hid in the shades of time, yet unborn, to whom would the secret be revealed by immediate inspiration?",
  "60865": "Then are we to impose all our enactments on men and none of them on women?",
  "60866": "And now what are we to do?",
  "60867": "You want to know how we came here?",
  "60868": "What then are we to understand by the objection which this paper has combated?",
  "60869": "What could he do to move this crowd and definitely to win over public opinion?",
  "60870": "Can we send the child back to the asylum?",
  "60871": "And what plainer than that he treats him then as a beast of burden?",
  "60872": "The patch or the campaign?",
  "60873": "To act?",
  "60874": "Did you, indeed?",
  "60875": "I'll go to 'em tonight and sing a wedding song, hey?",
  "60876": "In the table?",
  "60877": "Did you hear, goodman?",
  "60878": "So he won't have it?",
  "60879": "And you'll stick to it, mother?",
  "60880": "Why talk of me?",
  "60881": "But the quarter's notice?",
  "60882": "But why I had no notice of his ire?",
  "60883": "Or is one soul in the very least degree more or less, or more or less completely, a soul than another?",
  "60884": "Will the marquis honor me by a few moments' private conversation?",
  "60885": "What were they?",
  "60886": "I suppose he's in no immediate danger?",
  "60887": "Who shall regulate all the mixed conversation of our youth, male and female together, as is the fashion of this country?",
  "60888": "Had he, on the other hand, smoked too much?",
  "60889": "What castellan that received him in his castle ever made him pay his shot?",
  "60890": "But the lock?",
  "60891": "Shall I kiss your hand upon the contract?",
  "60892": "Don't you think that's better than subletting?",
  "60893": "May I ask the name?",
  "60894": "What?",
  "60895": "Strangers?",
  "60896": "Or were they there from some ulterior motive?",
  "60897": "Does it?",
  "60898": "But you'll come back to dinner?",
  "60899": "Shall I open a flask?",
  "60900": "Why bother about human relationships?",
  "60901": "And will he bring me back a bear?",
  "60902": "What would that language have been?",
  "60903": "What more can I do?",
  "60904": "Have you cried your grief away?",
  "60905": "Have you picked many of your apples yet?",
  "60906": "What was going to happen to her henceforth?",
  "60907": "I can't out of the bottle, can I?",
  "60908": "Shall my father be informed of your wish?",
  "60909": "To hide, in the nature of how many women?",
  "60910": "You believed in my good fortune in the old days, do you now doubt this true story?",
  "60911": "You've not met since that night?",
  "60912": "Will you try?",
  "60913": "What course do you intend to take?",
  "60914": "Now, how shall we settle this?",
  "60915": "What is it to you?",
  "60916": "Do you think that I was then dead to agony and remorse?",
  "60917": "Any news?",
  "60918": "Is there no end to it?",
  "60919": "But a ricordo of what?",
  "60920": "How many times have we had danger from this question?",
  "60921": "Which is the part in man, which, as he grows fatter, never gains flesh?",
  "60922": "And don't he know me?",
  "60923": "And next, how does he live?",
  "60924": "Am not I here, whom you have made your creature?",
  "60925": "Do you want to hire any men?",
  "60926": "News?",
  "60927": "You are a scholar too, I dare say?",
  "60928": "Did you come here to fetch me?",
  "60929": "In praising his generosity, who can mingle any censure for such manifest prudence?",
  "60930": "Don't you know nothing?",
  "60931": "Have you come to see me or my mother?",
  "60932": "Nelly gave it to him?",
  "60933": "What the devil do I see yonder?",
  "60934": "And your previous dreams, were they real too?",
  "60935": "Do you want to see me?",
  "60936": "Hucky, do you das't to go if I lead?",
  "60937": "Did you get here quickly?",
  "60938": "What was their reply?",
  "60939": "Does one know?",
  "60940": "What's the beadig of this?",
  "60941": "Not one word of comfort?",
  "60942": "May I ask of what breed he is sprung?",
  "60943": "What sort of grim adventure was it on which I had embarked?",
  "60944": "Would you have done it?",
  "60945": "Will you not give up this plan?",
  "60946": "Don't you know who WE are, either?",
  "60947": "D'ye think there's any money hanging by it?",
  "60948": "But could you not be mended?",
  "60949": "Does that seem like too much work?",
  "60950": "Who are these creatures?",
  "60951": "Isn't the sight of him maimed like that enough to melt the heart of a stone?",
  "60952": "What witnesses would support my statements?",
  "60953": "You remember what are the properties of two similar triangles?",
  "60954": "WELL, and how does success taste?",
  "60955": "How in thunder d'ye work that out?",
  "60956": "She would be ashamed of her mother, you mean, and of her mother's brother too, eh?",
  "60957": "Mates, do you hear that?",
  "60958": "Of what do you complain?",
  "60959": "Or come sad tidings from our native land?",
  "60960": "You know what it is to be in love?",
  "60961": "In the smuggling line?",
  "60962": "Do you wish to say anything further to him?",
  "60963": "Hussey?",
  "60964": "Had it not been pity so good a man should have been cast away?",
  "60965": "Why do we prize changing organism more than inorganic matter, unchanging and constant?",
  "60966": "But is this a defence?",
  "60967": "You perceive then the utter impossibility of escaping through your dungeon?",
  "60968": "You like this weather?",
  "60969": "Then, does he write?",
  "60970": "What of it, then?",
  "60971": "Well, are they at home, my good man?",
  "60972": "WAS IT A PARTISAN PROSECUTION?",
  "60973": "When houses are owned by loyal citizens, but are unoccupied?",
  "60974": "Are we really quite lost, your excellency?",
  "60975": "Look here, dear prince, BE so kind, will you?",
  "60976": "Is it not well that such men should be brought low?",
  "60977": "And what is the new one like?",
  "60978": "Do you not see how the old man who drives a cart looks anxiously about?",
  "60979": "What will you eat?",
  "60980": "Is my peace nothing?",
  "60981": "Isn't it acting, my dear, to accept it?",
  "60982": "But what was his share in it that he can't be forgiven for?",
  "60983": "What business is 't of yours?",
  "60984": "Can't we get a special?",
  "60985": "You are right, clearness is what you wish, is it not?",
  "60986": "And you say this young man behaved himself well?",
  "60987": "Are we not to put on our diver's dresses?",
  "60988": "If we couldn't be perfectly frank and dear with each other, it would be ever so much better, wouldn't it?",
  "60989": "But for what purpose is it your idea that they should again so intimately meet?",
  "60990": "Let you steer?",
  "60991": "But, tell me, what do you ask?",
  "60992": "How about opening our letters?",
  "60993": "But what is the cause of this increasing humidity?",
  "60994": "Are you in contentment now?",
  "60995": "And from what?",
  "60996": "How much will that be?",
  "60997": "And in all these cases, the recollection may be derived from things either like or unlike?",
  "60998": "What are you staring at?",
  "60999": "Home?",
  "61000": "How much do I owe you?",
  "61001": "Of my old friends?",
  "61002": "The devil's agents may be of flesh and blood, may they not?",
  "61003": "Did she tell you of this?",
  "61004": "Do I date it?",
  "61005": "Or shall we say, that it is of any service in the conduct of life, and an assistant to prudence?",
  "61006": "What shall I try this time?",
  "61007": "Call you this dying?",
  "61008": "And why weep for this?",
  "61009": "How is it you are on foot?",
  "61010": "So you're a messenger of victory, eh?",
  "61011": "Can you tell me whence I derive this inference?",
  "61012": "Had he eyebrows like that?",
  "61013": "What is there I care for?",
  "61014": "Was it still night?",
  "61015": "Don't you want to read it?",
  "61016": "Who was this almost beardless young man, who was so glacial and so generous, who knew people's names, who knew all their names, and who opened his purse to them, who bullied rascals like a judge, and who paid them like a dupe?",
  "61017": "Why came I here to cast away my life?",
  "61018": "The old gentleman over the way?",
  "61019": "Did you say, four ladies?",
  "61020": "Do you still wish to dispose of all?",
  "61021": "Does he tell lies?",
  "61022": "I wonder what it can be?",
  "61023": "Why should this place lie idle?",
  "61024": "Do you see this little door and little house?",
  "61025": "Do these correspond to the phases of apprehension?",
  "61026": "Don't you think you can smell the smoke here?",
  "61027": "Am I not a member of the consulting commission?",

  "61029": "Who told you so?",
  "61030": "For whom were the soldiers below at the carriage waiting?",
  "61031": "Now won't you give me the tortoise?",
  "61032": "Must the citizen ever for a moment, or in the least degree, resign his conscience to the legislator?",

  "61034": "If you saw me looking out of an upper window, you'd think I was a fine woman, wouldn't you?",
  "61035": "But can this be so confidently said of sexual selection?",
  "61036": "And is there any hope of that, sir?",
  "61037": "Where are you going?",
  "61038": "You will appear at this ball?",
  "61039": "What did I come for?",
  "61040": "Whose?",
  "61041": "This is where he lives, is it?",
  "61042": "But what does all this mean?",
  "61043": "And have you a pale blue dress on?",
  "61044": "And in the course of that month?",
  "61045": "If there were one man who would carry you a medical reform and another who would oppose it, should you inquire which had the better motives or even the better brains?",

  "61048": "Is it true that you received there a man who is your lover?",
  "61049": "Is any man, in these days, sensible, seeing what a racket we have to live among?",
  "61050": "Quis custodiet istos custodes?",
  "61051": "Let's sit here for a bit, shall we?",
  "61052": "How many days would it require to make two studs exactly like them?",
  "61053": "Then is not this test reliable?",
  "61054": "What could it be, once more?",
  "61055": "Have you neglected to obtain information on that point?",
  "61056": "When do the servants go to bed?",
  "61057": "Why take I not my pleasure when I may, seeing that I never need lack for occasions of trouble and vexation of spirit?",
  "61058": "He passes along the same path at the same hour, and to whom should he be going except to the convict?",
  "61059": "Wasn't it a noble chase?",
  "61060": "And the murderer?",
  "61061": "How might it come to pass that we should all die there, through anybody's hate?",
  "61062": "What did he do there?",
  "61063": "But can't I give you a new book?",
  "61064": "Are you not?",
  "61065": "And the queens?",
  "61066": "Where go ye now?",
  "61067": "What are they doing?",
  "61068": "Len, you will make it all right?",

  "61071": "He only peeps?",
  "61072": "When will you come to see me?",
  "61073": "What would you wish for, girls, if you could have a wish granted?",
  "61074": "What can I be?",
  "61075": "Why, what were you going to do?",
  "61076": "How then could you have recognized me, if you have never seen my portrait or my person?",

  "61081": "Why had everybody been in such a frantic hurry in this matter?",
  "61082": "He'd better nip his little passion in the bud, hadn't he?",
  "61083": "How old are they?",
  "61084": "How would a boy like that?",
  "61085": "O was she so?",
  "61086": "Because, if it was so long ago, how could the people about him have made that mistake of putting some of the trouble out of his head, after it was taken off, into mine?",
  "61087": "To place yourself under his protection?",
  "61088": "Ay, do you make a wonder on't?",
  "61089": "Why should I object?",
  "61090": "What but a future of patient labor?",
  "61091": "How is your father getting on?",
  "61092": "These walls are you going, gentlemen?",
  "61093": "Where is such a judge to be found?",
  "61094": "Why, then, is he not indemnified?",
  "61095": "Why did they do it?",
  "61096": "These were the exact words, my beloved husband, were they not?",
  "61097": "Is it for my own pleasure that I am at the farm or in the office from morning to night?",
  "61098": "He is not resident, then?",
  "61099": "Is the swallow in sight?",
  "61100": "What kind of fish?",
  "61101": "Where had she seen those lineaments before?",
  "61102": "Why must he?",
  "61103": "What has she written to me?",
  "61104": "Have you ever been on it?",
  "61105": "What do you mean?",
  "61106": "Are you sure she is safe?",
  "61107": "Can he be inconstant before being happy?",

  "61114": "Think better of what?",
  "61115": "Mayn't I sing them just one LITTLE song?",
  "61116": "Should they end by both getting lost, and by furnishing two skeletons in a nook of that night?",
  "61117": "What is your name, my friend?",
  "61118": "Or could it be that within lay the secret to the treasure stores?",
  "61119": "Are you satisfied, gentlemen?",
  "61120": "The name of your ship?",
  "61121": "Wish to consult me on the matter?",

  "61126": "You have actually seen the members of the legislature?",
  "61127": "And if he wakes up presently, where shall we be?",
  "61128": "And the best hack?",
  "61129": "Why do you not turn round and speak to me properly?",
  "61130": "What's in the bottle, boy?",
  "61131": "Of what was he thinking during this profound depression?",
  "61132": "How is it that it opposed no resistance to the motion of comets which have almost grazed the sun's surface?",

  "61162": "Why did you look at the sunset?",
  "61163": "Why did they insist so strenuously upon this, and incorporate it into their philosophy?",
  "61164": "Shall I ring for candles, sir?",
  "61165": "Oh, why should I be made to worry?",
  "61166": "Have you found your tramp?",
  "61167": "With whom?",
  "61168": "Do you see the joke?",
  "61169": "But why this elaborate deception?",
  "61170": "Should you mind?",

  "61182": "No mental inconvenience, I hope?",
  "61183": "There has been fighting, then?",

  "61211": "Then will you consider about it, neighbour?",
  "61212": "Hurt?",
  "61213": "Swerve me?",

  "61253": "This is what the newspapers call agricultural depression, is it not?",
  "61254": "Is it not natural that the madman, ignorant of his folly, should attempt things beyond his power?",
  "61255": "What do you call succeeding?",
  "61256": "You leave me, then?",
  "61257": "Then you have some new idea?",
  "61258": "And what is that to you?",
  "61259": "Is it the like of that murderer?",
  "61260": "But what can be their aim?",
  "61261": "I suppose there is no doubt that the mark was there yesterday?",
  "61262": "What can this mean?",

  "61264": "Are you the doctor?",
  "61265": "On account of his hay fever?",
  "61266": "Who employed you to assassinate me?",
  "61267": "Can you call up the view to mind?",
  "61268": "How the deuce, my dear, would you have me behave respectfully to such a fool as your brother?",

  "61289": "What on earth do you mean?",
  "61290": "Why don't you say some yourself?",
  "61291": "You like this, do you?",
  "61292": "Of what consequence to you, reader, is my obscure individuality?",
  "61293": "Do such people trouble themselves about the problems of social economy?",
  "61294": "What did I say?",
  "61295": "Did she strike you?",
  "61296": "Why do you not obey my orders to report strength and positions of your command?",
  "61297": "Should not a magistrate be not merely the best administrator of the law, but the most crafty expounder of the chicanery of his profession, a steel probe to search hearts, a touchstone to try the gold which in each soul is mingled with more or less of alloy?",
  "61298": "Then I must wait here, or in the neighborhood?",
  "61299": "Why don't you?",
  "61300": "And what is her name?",
  "61301": "What would you advise me to use in its stead, father?",

  "61312": "I say, just wring out my jacket skirts, will ye?",
  "61313": "Not live with her husband?",
  "61314": "Aren't those gulls splendid?",
  "61315": "Why, what's that?",
  "61316": "Which of us has his desire?",
  "61317": "Have you seen nobody?",

  "61322": "By force?",
  "61323": "How does that hit you?",

  "61335": "Why, papa, what is the matter?",
  "61336": "I may now perhaps mention what I wished to say to you?",
  "61337": "What's gone with that boy, I wonder?",
  "61338": "Is not his authority of power to give our scene approbation?",
  "61339": "And what are this gentleman's commands with me?",
  "61340": "What do you mean by ambitious?",
  "61341": "And if I do it for him, what do you think he's promised me?",
  "61342": "And will moralists pretend to assert, that this is the condition in which one half of the human race should be encouraged to remain with listless inactivity and stupid acquiescence?",
  "61343": "And did you not tell him to go back?",
  "61344": "I hope that I make it all plain?",
  "61345": "And is the soul seen or not seen?",
  "61346": "And was it only fancy which induced me to believe that, with the increase of my own firmness, that of my tormentor underwent a proportional diminution?",
  "61347": "Can you tell me where I am?",

  "61353": "It was real, then?",
  "61354": "Is it a year, or more, or less?",
  "61355": "Can you find in your hearts* to despoil the gentle, trusting creatures of their treasure, or do any thing to strip them of their native robe of virtue?",
  "61356": "Why not possible?",
  "61357": "Would you want to hesitate, do you want to wait any longer?",
  "61358": "What is then left of us?",
  "61359": "Where did he get it?",
  "61360": "And not heard from her, eh?",
  "61361": "I merely say, with quite another view, you are probably aware I have some property to bequeath to my child?",
  "61362": "Yes, do you mean a change of heart?",
  "61363": "Had he not broken the ribs of a gamekeeper who abused him for having, gun in hand, passed through a neighbor's property?",
  "61364": "Surrender her to YOU?",
  "61365": "Who, then, has so correctly informed you?",
  "61366": "Sir, what have I done to dissatisfy you?",
  "61367": "Well, have you heard the great news?",
  "61368": "Do you remember the nights in the bedroom?",
  "61369": "Can't you tell us more about what happened?",

  "61378": "Don't you want some, too?",
  "61379": "Does he think it's manly, to torture a horse?",
  "61380": "What is the matter with you today?",
  "61381": "Why he not help my papa?",
  "61382": "Shall I come for a walk with you tonight when I've put the children to bed?",
  "61383": "What have I deserved for my sins but hell and everlasting fire?",
  "61384": "And how about food?",
  "61385": "Why in good thunderation can't you be more easy?",
  "61386": "What's that for?",
  "61387": "Two?",
  "61388": "But how will you bestow your time, when you will have no visits to receive or pay?",
  "61389": "Then they allow the lackey to remain with him?",
  "61390": "How long ago is it?",
  "61391": "Well, so much being disposed of, what is left?",
  "61392": "But is it him indeed?",
  "61393": "What is it you fear?",
  "61394": "I hope 'tis coming to something?",
  "61395": "How d'ye do, boy?",

  "61399": "Will he have a grain of respect for you?",
  "61400": "How are the rest of your affairs progressing, apart from the business?",
  "61401": "Did master say so his own self?",
  "61402": "For how, sir, shall you be able to learn whether or no I am superior to others of my sex both in goodness of heart and understanding, if I let you dine in my cloisters squalid and ill clad?",
  "61403": "But if you don't know this woman, how do you know her name?",
  "61404": "Sir, are you here?",
  "61405": "Can't we go now?",
  "61406": "But in extreames what patience shall I vse?",
  "61407": "How is my heart still moved when I think of your goodness?",
  "61408": "A lord?",
  "61409": "Do you leave me?",
  "61410": "Whether advocates and orators had liberty to plead in causes manifestly known to be unjust, vexatious, or oppressive?",
  "61411": "Where are you going, marechal?",
  "61412": "Who could hear unmoved of the fall of that which had been so great, and which had stood so long?",
  "61413": "Did he wish to wait until night, and leave the submarine passage secretly?",
  "61414": "Is there anything more?",
  "61415": "Because you're so sure he so really wants my company?",
  "61416": "Do you particularly object to ladies studying?",
  "61417": "And you have given up your cathedral work here?",
  "61418": "Am I to govern by another's will?",
  "61419": "What is it now?",
  "61420": "Why didn't you come in?",
  "61421": "What of this kingdom?",
  "61422": "So we may not enter into transgression?",
  "61423": "He won't be in the way, will he?",
  "61424": "Who dares mock at him?",
  "61425": "And these other people?",
  "61426": "But where are these latter stepping?",
  "61427": "But who made all those worlds, beaming so gloriously above us?",
  "61428": "Again, is not the passionate element wholly set on ruling and conquering and getting fame?",
  "61429": "You're sure it's far enough off?",
  "61430": "Would they live years and years if no one helped them?",
  "61431": "So etherealised by spirit as he was, and so apotheosised by worshipping admirers, did his footsteps, in the procession, really tread upon the dust of earth?",
  "61432": "Both them ar chaps parsons?",
  "61433": "May I depart, monseigneur?",
  "61434": "What, straight from the station to my house?",
  "61435": "How do you think these garments fit me?",
  "61436": "What is all this for?",
  "61437": "Will it seem odd if I ask?",

  "61441": "Will he explain it?",
  "61442": "Was he to be carried back by the wind which had blown him there?",
  "61443": "We shall be sitting down to eat in a minute, and it's a formal occasion, darling, isn't it?",
  "61444": "But shouldn't we feel more compassion for the victims of crime than for those who commit crime?",
  "61445": "What is to be done then?",
  "61446": "Can't I do what I like with him?",
  "61447": "Where is a candle?",
  "61448": "May they not have believed, in fact, that it was a plant fallen from the sky, a gift of the divinity?",
  "61449": "Hearty, I thank you, said he, how be you?",
  "61450": "Whuzya think, hey?",
  "61451": "And why, then, did you not refuse him?",
  "61452": "Are you my friend?",
  "61453": "But the point is, had he money?",
  "61454": "What does he say?",
  "61455": "Am I to go to him and make a deed of conveyance?",
  "61456": "What is its consistency, if it extends many million miles from the sun's surface?",
  "61457": "Have you any one to depend on for assistance?",
  "61458": "What was the meaning of that fatigue, my friend?",
  "61459": "Perhaps it was only a false alarm that troubled you, and the enemy are not advancing?",
  "61460": "But now, how do you arrange your documents?",
  "61461": "Or is it thy dewy hand the daisy tips?",
  "61462": "Jacob's?",

  "61468": "How can I want to quarrel with you?",
  "61469": "I hope the gentleman will understand that it isn't my fault, sir?",
  "61470": "Surely you don't think that it was I?",
  "61471": "Why had he disobeyed his father, who had been always so generous to him?",
  "61472": "Of what are you talking?",
  "61473": "What did you want?",
  "61474": "Beauty?",
  "61475": "Are there women or are there not?",
  "61476": "Set out?",
  "61477": "Yet did I not first roughly kiss her as we danced?",
  "61478": "Well, and what may you have to say against this name?",
  "61479": "How do you like them?",
  "61480": "And he who is not on a voyage has no need of a pilot?",
  "61481": "But who will lead?",
  "61482": "You'll get plenty of fresh air, won't you?",
  "61483": "But, my dear, is not this rather out of character?",
  "61484": "Or a woman?",
  "61485": "Well, if so, why do you object to my doing so?",
  "61486": "Are you the boy I've read of in the papers?",
  "61487": "Oh, what's wrong?",
  "61488": "What's the use?",
  "61489": "And if he let go his hold?",
  "61490": "In what way has it a tendency to prove that?",
  "61491": "Who is at the door other than he?",
  "61492": "Are you still resolved to accompany me?",
  "61493": "She's such a splendid woman, isn't she?",
  "61494": "What does he do?",
  "61495": "Why did you keep me waiting so long?",
  "61496": "Can I say of her innocent and girlish beauty, that it faded, and was no more, when its breath falls on my cheek now, as it fell that night?",
  "61497": "Do you know why?",
  "61498": "Why, what's the MATTER with you?",
  "61499": "My dear friend, what has happened?",
  "61500": "You had no idea of your impending good fortune, in those times?",
  "61501": "Do you think you can better yourselves, on that subject, by leaving us here under no obligation whatever to return those specimens of your movable property that come hither?",
  "61502": "Nice?",
  "61503": "May its poppet come in and talk?",
  "61504": "Yet still I have my uses, uses that vanish in monotony, and still I must ask why should we bury the talent of these bright sensations altogether?",
  "61505": "And what was it this time last year?",
  "61506": "Don't you care for me at all?",
  "61507": "But what is theory?",
  "61508": "Then, sir, you are satisfied?",
  "61509": "And what if he had?",
  "61510": "And why is he here?",
  "61511": "That is your final decision?",
  "61512": "Do you remember what fun it often was when guests came in the evening?",
  "61513": "How long ago?",
  "61514": "Well, how can I he of service to you?",
  "61515": "What was the use of squandering the days of his youth in an office when the world was beautiful?",
  "61516": "But, tell me, have they all one motion, both situ et tempore?",
  "61517": "And you selected it yourself?",
  "61518": "I know it, but in asking for news, I mean, have you done anything for me?",
  "61519": "What on earth have I done now?",
  "61520": "When does it become an idolum specus, the unreasonable pertinacity of a too sceptical mind?",
  "61521": "When will he be here?",
  "61522": "Something extraordinary must await us farther on, but, what?",
  "61523": "When shall I wake?",
  "61524": "And do you really flatter yourself that I shall yield to all your caprices, and quietly and humbly await the time of again being received into your good graces?",
  "61525": "What had he come there to do?",
  "61526": "And how stands the fact?",
  "61527": "Do you ever work, child?",
  "61528": "You hear, sir?",
  "61529": "What would you do if you were in my place?",
  "61530": "The gentleman to whom I had the honour of being introduced?",
  "61531": "Not to see the father?",
  "61532": "Will you overlook it this once and forgive me, and let things go on as before?",
  "61533": "What am I to tell him?",
  "61534": "Won't you find it an awful nuisance to look after a baby?",
  "61535": "Where do you come from?",
  "61536": "And what did you say about it, bishop?",
  "61537": "Then why are we here, my friends?",
  "61538": "Boats in the royal service?",
  "61539": "What is your religion?",
  "61540": "Must it not, indeed, be told to the whole circle of her acquaintance before she could be made to stand all right with them?",
  "61541": "Verily, do I still live?",
  "61542": "All as it should be, is it not?",
  "61543": "Is that strong on him still?",
  "61544": "Do you want to go to all of them?",
  "61545": "What does tha' know about him?",
  "61546": "What shall I think of this?",
  "61547": "Come, now, what do you want?",
  "61548": "Daae not see you come down from your room by the curious road which you selected?",
  "61549": "But as a man of honor should answer another, tell me fairly, shall you pay these with the same punctuality?",
  "61550": "And when doth this take place?",
  "61551": "But his stables had been searched?",
  "61552": "But, it will be asked further, can I make any use of this conception and hypothesis in my investigations into the world and nature?",
  "61553": "Of his own desire?",
  "61554": "Why should anyone pay?",
  "61555": "What do you wish of me?",
  "61556": "Such work is healthy, isn't it, sir?",
  "61557": "Pay?",
  "61558": "Home?",
  "61559": "And when?",
  "61560": "Then why should he be persecuted?",
  "61561": "Does aught lie on it?",
  "61562": "That's frank, isn't it?",
  "61563": "Where have you sprung up from?",
  "61564": "To what class of society does he belong?",
  "61565": "How come?",
  "61566": "Where now are all your high resolves at last?",
  "61567": "And will no murmurs fill the courts above?",
  "61568": "When?",
  "61569": "Marriage?",
  "61570": "Then that is all quite settled, is it not?",
  "61571": "Have you told master that you heard a laugh?",
  "61572": "Or cometh it in person?",
  "61573": "What more can we do?",
  "61574": "What in the world does the man mean?",
  "61575": "What does anybody want here?",
  "61576": "Why, do you know how pretty you are, child?",
  "61577": "Will you not allow that I have as much of the spirit of prophecy in me as the swans?",
  "61578": "Shall we wait, or shall we charge?",
  "61579": "Ere I was old?",
  "61580": "What is this dim and ambiguous consciousness which, after a certain time, becomes purified, rectified, and, instead of taking itself for another, definitively apprehends itself as such?",
  "61581": "Do you know his man?",
  "61582": "Will you so?",
  "61583": "Who are the true martyrs, of those who are slain on my side, or on that of my enemies?",
  "61584": "Well, what hinders your sleeping?",
  "61585": "And you'll be my friend?",
  "61586": "May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?",
  "61587": "What do you mean to say?",
  "61588": "Ain't I a crow?",
  "61589": "How about prying?",
  "61590": "Then he could not have retreated down the road, and you say that there are no side roads?",
  "61591": "Qui est ton pere?",
  "61592": "Yea, why should his father let him, if it come to that?",
  "61593": "Briefly, what did you glean?",
  "61594": "Didn't you see the look in his eyes when he talked about her?",
  "61595": "Gone, you say she is?",
  "61596": "Why does there come an hour when one emerges from this azure, and why does life go on afterwards?",
  "61597": "What has broken your heart?",
  "61598": "Do you think you will find that spring soon?",
  "61599": "How was I?",
  "61600": "Why doesn't he come to the house?",
  "61601": "And why do the children, the grandchildren, all the descendants of the first parents always return here?",

  "61608": "Do ye not feel the thirst and the hot breath of her love?",
  "61609": "So that you may both get tipsy, is that it, and stay here gabbing all day?",
  "61610": "Why was she brought here?",
  "61611": "I, my lord?",
  "61612": "And don't you know that you are prettier than you ever were?",
  "61613": "Am I really wonderful?",
  "61614": "Well, was there?",
  "61615": "What is she sentenced to?",
  "61616": "And how much for one that's all chewed up like this one?",
  "61617": "The curate?",
  "61618": "Were you alone during this conversation?",
  "61619": "Shall I have a nurse?",
  "61620": "Do you want to drown yourselves, or dash yourselves to pieces among these wheels?",
  "61621": "Was he anywhere near the big shed where we build the machines?",
  "61622": "But have we hydrogen enough to inflate a balloon?",
  "61623": "Has it a copper leg?",
  "61624": "What had she better do, or how was it expedient that she should treat him?",
  "61625": "The door key?",
  "61626": "Looked?",
  "61627": "What of that?",
  "61628": "Shall we let him in or not, if you are asleep?",
  "61629": "Repellently and stunningly clever?",
  "61630": "Where could you keep it?",
  "61631": "It's all sand here, ain't it?",
  "61632": "And that of a fluid body?",
  "61633": "Had HE his idea, and has he now, with you, anything more?",
  "61634": "Who took any?",
  "61635": "Was he true to them?",

  "62599": "Is it not a canonical and authentic exception, worthy to be premised to all our undertakings?",
  "62600": "Ah, friends, what shall I do?",
  "62601": "Do we not both take from the poor people that which they can ill spare?",

  "62615": "Swinging by the chain?",
  "62616": "What put it into your head, little mother?",
  "62617": "You don't mean to say he's here?",
  "62618": "Then it is very thin wine?",
  "62619": "Did I offer to hit him or did I not?",
  "62620": "And what temperature may that be?",
  "62621": "Have you a pair of silent shoes?",
  "62622": "Who else should do so?",
  "62623": "And to what effect?",
  "62624": "I shall meet them there, and who knows what future advantages may result from the interview?",
  "62625": "Could it have been aught but a shipwreck which had drawn it under the water?",

  "62645": "Do you find the answer?",
  "62646": "At last she is dead?",
  "62647": "Do you mean to say you couldn't love me then?",
  "62648": "Don't you hear to what soft whispers the wind has fallen?",
  "62649": "Time to start?",
  "62650": "Wasn't it as good as a marriage?",
  "62651": "You understand?",
  "62652": "But how did you know that I was a prisoner back there?",
  "62653": "Wherein?",
  "62654": "Which do you prefer?",
  "62655": "What can be more gratifying than such a retrospect as this?",
  "62656": "What did she say?",
  "62657": "Oh, indeed?",
  "62658": "Besides, which am I to choose?",
  "62659": "Instead, then, of consecrating monopolies from which the holders are to derive no privilege save that of straightway losing, with the income, all the enjoyment thereof, why not decree the agrarian law at once?",
  "62660": "Go to?",
  "62661": "But how could I, a poor dazed village lad, avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best and wisest of men fall every day?",
  "62662": "Well, why not?",
  "62663": "What does it all mean?",
  "62664": "I may assume that there is a second to be mentioned?",
  "62665": "And it's a very pretty name, don't you think?",
  "62666": "Your father is dead?",
  "62667": "Of whom?",
  "62668": "Natasha, you would not deceive me?",
  "62669": "What were you doing in the battle, my friend?",
  "62670": "But does not this expose himself more than me?",
  "62671": "And is not this the reason why of old love has been called a tyrant?",
  "62672": "What are you doing here?",
  "62673": "Why not take a number of banths and set them loose before us above ground?",
  "62674": "How long did he wear it?",
  "62675": "Is he not a prey which will always be within your grasp?",
  "62676": "What instructing do you think I should do?",
  "62677": "What took her away?",
  "62678": "Yes, how long?",
  "62679": "Is it not the separation of soul and body?",
  "62680": "It is said to have been a congestion of the brain, or apoplexy, which is the same thing, is it not?",
  "62681": "Executions?",
  "62682": "Have commissioned you to tell me what you have just stated?",
  "62683": "Remorse or regret?",
  "62684": "How am I to describe it?",
  "62685": "Tulkinghorn?",
  "62686": "Why are you smiling, prince?",
  "62687": "And if he had not, why did he take her again?",
  "62688": "That is your intention, is it not?",
  "62689": "Will it pass?",
  "62690": "Why did you pick him?",
  "62691": "Do you suppose these stoneless mounds hide no dust of what were men just as good?",
  "62692": "Where are those passionate eyes that appeal'd to my eyes in passion?",
  "62693": "What is it that you say you are going to do?",
  "62694": "What did she send?",
  "62695": "Should he find him at all?",
  "62696": "Why should I meddle?",
  "62697": "The earlier it might be, would it not be better?",
  "62698": "The theories say that, do they?",
  "62699": "And what hope was there that these designs would fail?",
  "62700": "Not from the photos I have showed you?",
  "62701": "Have you ever noticed that the ones we would love the most distractedly are those whom we never meet to know?",
  "62702": "Well, then, my lord, say, are you satisfied?",
  "62703": "Gentlemen, do you stare?",
  "62704": "Well, what do you want?",
  "62705": "Why, monsieur, what secret can you expect to find in the hollow head of a soldier?",
  "62706": "Are you going to return there?",
  "62707": "What need has it of exaggeration?",
  "62708": "What if she loves you now better than anyone?",
  "62709": "Do you happen to know any one in this neighbourhood who would receive him for a while on my paying for him beforehand?",
  "62710": "He has done his best, but what does a fish's best come to when the fish is out of water?",
  "62711": "You are a reactionary, then?",
  "62712": "What's up, anyhow?",
  "62713": "Will there, indeed?",
  "62714": "Who drove you to it?",
  "62715": "We being strangers here, how dare you trust so great a charge from your own custody?",
  "62716": "You are a wheelwright?",
  "62717": "Does that suit you?",
  "62718": "Is anything the matter, aunt?",
  "62719": "And shall we just carelessly allow children to hear any casual tales which may be devised by casual persons, and to receive into their minds ideas for the most part the very opposite of those which we should wish them to have when they are grown up?",
  "62720": "But did be profess any attachment?",
  "62721": "Who are you, madame?",
  "62722": "Did you ever taste beer?",
  "62723": "Boomer?",

  "62729": "I say, did you mean it the other day that you wouldn't marry me if I asked you?",
  "62730": "And what would their parents think of me, if they saw or heard the children rioting, hatless, bonnetless, gloveless, and bootless, in the deep soft snow?",
  "62731": "Is anyone up in your house?",
  "62732": "Will that suit you?",
  "62733": "Have I not explained your wishes, grandpapa?",
  "62734": "Did you see it?",
  "62735": "And, to be frank, my lord, was I wrong?",
  "62736": "From what?",
  "62737": "How was he to meet his lawyer?",
  "62738": "Herod?",
  "62739": "Cautious, why so?",
  "62740": "Was it the better to deceive them both?",
  "62741": "Why can't I?",
  "62742": "Did you tell us?",
  "62743": "Do you understand what you have done to me?",
  "62744": "Nor church?",
  "62745": "Does it end with just our two selves?",
  "62746": "Will there be beds for me and all who seek?",
  "62747": "But it's SOMEBODY'S plates, ain't it?",
  "62748": "What virtue will there be then, said the monk, in their bullets of concupiscence, their habits and their bodies?",
  "62749": "How do I know?",

  "62764": "Did you see him come out on us?",
  "62765": "Why lie awake nights worrying about this?",
  "62766": "And if I did not obey his call, who could answer for what might happen?",
  "62767": "Or worse than the parts they acted require?",
  "62768": "What did you go out for?",
  "62769": "Well, then, what's the sense in wasting the plates?",
  "62770": "Can we not, then, men of common sense, while awaiting the solution which the future will undoubtedly bring forth, prepare ourselves for this great transition by an analysis of the struggling powers, as well as their positive and negative qualities?",
  "62771": "Have you not lately renewed your promise?",
  "62772": "Whose are these beautiful green meadows?",
  "62773": "And why do we set our soul and body, which are such dear companions, at such variance?",
  "62774": "Living together?",
  "62775": "Did you never hear it?",
  "62776": "You don't remember me?",
  "62777": "And what else is paper currency?",
  "62778": "And do you propose to make this journey very shortly?",

  "62784": "And what explanation is given of the girl's death?",
  "62785": "What was the dreadful thing I dreamed?",
  "62786": "I should think it was a very pleasant life, the married one, eh?",
  "62787": "But what shall we reply to the medals, undoubtedly genuine, which reckon the fifth year of his tribunitian power?",
  "62788": "Have we either of us ever rubbed thumbs over honestly gained farthings?",
  "62789": "Ah, you are the young woman come to look after my birds?",
  "62790": "Why could not I, going up to bed with my basket of keys, stop to sit down by her fire and accommodate myself for a little while to her, at least as well as to anybody else, and not trouble myself about the harmless things she said to me?",
  "62791": "There ain't nothing wrong?",
  "62792": "In order, perhaps, to give countenance to the objection at any rate, it may be asked, is there not danger of an opposite bias in the national government, which may dispose it to endeavor to secure a monopoly of the federal administration to the landed class?",
  "62793": "How can we help it?",
  "62794": "Why do you ask such a question, I said, when you ought rather to be answering?",

  "62802": "Yes, why did I not steal?",
  "62803": "Will you say it is because the body is the medium of suffering in this life?",
  "62804": "Haven't you no manners?",
  "62805": "Now you will be able to go home and tell your friends that you have personally seen and heard the southern lights, for I suppose you have no doubt that you have really done so?",
  "62806": "And are who what?",
  "62807": "You are of my opinion?",
  "62808": "Could it be possible that the squire was going to make a fool of himself and get married?",
  "62809": "Funny, ain't it, that you and me both had the same idea about spending our vacation?",
  "62810": "But you will?",
  "62811": "Then why didn't you say so?",
  "62812": "How much is it?",
  "62813": "You will permit me to consider him an invalid?",
  "62814": "Where is he concealed?",
  "62815": "But was it his fault?",
  "62816": "You spoke to my coachman, then?",
  "62817": "Was the photograph a cabinet?",
  "62818": "Who's go dar?",
  "62819": "Didn't you hear us calling you?",
  "62820": "For the commission, is it not my whole future?",
  "62821": "Why all this excitement?",
  "62822": "Do you know the numbers?",
  "62823": "Do you wish you may die if you do know, hey?",
  "62824": "Why then should he repine when the hour of separation arrives?",
  "62825": "She had no reason for walking elsewhere, and why should she not go that way?",
  "62826": "Where is the knave?",
  "62827": "Any news, father?",
  "62828": "When did you see him last?",
  "62829": "Why, pray, did he add the old day?",
  "62830": "You think he went off just by chance?",
  "62831": "Is the cause of my soreness such a mystery that there's any need to tell me I am sore everywhere the staff hit me?",
  "62832": "Couldn't ye ha' said soa, at onst?",
  "62833": "What be these two, signior?",
  "62834": "Can anyone here play the drum?",
  "62835": "Shall you like to have such a brother?",
  "62836": "And what is better than woman?",
  "62837": "Ye much hurt?",
  "62838": "How shall I ever look this man in the face again?",
  "62839": "Yes?",
  "62840": "You think there may be fighting?",
  "62841": "Could it be that by some neglect in the preparations, the substitution perhaps of the wrong brandy, the astralization could not be effected?",
  "62842": "Was this to her doom after all?",
  "62843": "How agreed?",
  "62844": "And those papers?",
  "62845": "How is the gentleman called?",
  "62846": "What do you mean, you minx?",
  "62847": "What can be done?",
  "62848": "And why are we here?",
  "62849": "How do you know I can't?",
  "62850": "Amontillado ?",
  "62851": "A coffin?",
  "62852": "Does it suggest anything to your mind?",
  "62853": "Is the second floor at home?",
  "62854": "Could I forget that last autumn at this same day of the month and at this same place you lighted exactly such a fire as a signal for me to come and see you?",
  "62855": "You are certain?",
  "62856": "Why, did you not hear all we said?",
  "62857": "How, how?",
  "62858": "Is this statement true?",
  "62859": "How would you find experimentally the relative quantities of heat given off when equal weights of sulphur, phosphorus, and carbon are thoroughly burned?",
  "62860": "Then it is my place to ask you what you are going to do about it?",
  "62861": "Won't you come in again, and stay as long as you like?",
  "62862": "Why are you up so early, my dear?",
  "62863": "Who will tell her?",
  "62864": "Guilty, of course?",
  "62865": "Do you laugh, you unfeeling brute, as if you enjoyed my distress?",
  "62866": "What enjoyment is there in making love to a woman who belongs to nobody and yet belongs to any one?",
  "62867": "Have you not a word to say to me?",
  "62868": "Two drunken men, eh?",
  "62869": "What need they torture their heads with that which others have taken so strictly and so unalterably into their own purveying?",
  "62870": "What can be more natural and characteristic?",
  "62871": "Is there anything particular?",
  "62872": "What are you upset about?",
  "62873": "But the bogus inspector?",
  "62874": "And where are the children?",
  "62875": "There are then people who inhabit it?",
  "62876": "But where is thy son now?",
  "62877": "Her happiness?",
  "62878": "Please, ma'am, could I inquire if this highly instructive and charming institution is a new one?",
  "62879": "Is it not conceivable, at least, that obedience to an unselfish impulse may result even in the sacrifice of the opportunities of moral culture in general?",
  "62880": "But why not?",
  "62881": "How would they address us?",
  "62882": "Is there any thing new in this doctrine?",
  "62883": "What was she to say to him?",
  "62884": "You doubt it then?",
  "62885": "What sort of mischief?",
  "62886": "What sense is there in murdering a man in order to define one's relation to a guilty wife and son?",
  "62887": "And what are the comforts or the education which a race of beings corrupted from their infancy, and unacquainted with all the duties of life, are fitted to bestow?",
  "62888": "Then this new kind of knowledge must have an additional quality?",
  "62889": "Lads, haven't you a sack?",
  "62890": "How do you mean, bold?",
  "62891": "They taught you that?",
  "62892": "But you, critic, the reader undoubtedly will ask, what is your solution?",
  "62893": "But the heat developed by the rapidity of the projectile in crossing the strata of air?",
  "62894": "Well, are you trying to make out that I've said you have?",
  "62895": "Three days ago?",
  "62896": "What is it, a man?",
  "62897": "Whom do you think that is to?",
  "62898": "The lighted window, right up there?",
  "62899": "An' you don't seem to have done any great things for yourself by going away?",
  "62900": "But if I lose?",
  "62901": "There, who are you?",
  "62902": "Or, perhaps, you may have the precious object she wants in your collection?",
  "62903": "Who do you think should be sent there?",
  "62904": "And what for?",
  "62905": "But, my dear fellow, in that case, why didn't you get him a pauper's funeral?",
  "62906": "Should he place his catastrophe as a third associate in their felicity?",
  "62907": "Can you speak, lady?",
  "62908": "He has extensive house property in the city and three places of business and isn't it to his own advantage to keep down the rates?",
  "62909": "Do what?",
  "62910": "That so?",
  "62911": "And you followed the business of a tailor?",
  "62912": "But how did you gain them?",
  "62913": "Whither should they go, and where should be the new seat of the mission?",
  "62914": "Why can't you let me alone?",
  "62915": "How does his apoplex?",
  "62916": "Ca vous amuse, la vie?",
  "62917": "You would throw over one that has stood by you this five years in favour of a man that you never saw before in your life?",
  "62918": "Ceremonies then are a subsequent thing?",
  "62919": "What can be keeping him?",
  "62920": "Some intrigue, D'Herblay?",
  "62921": "Why do you laugh, sir?",
  "62922": "Should she speak to her?",
  "62923": "Should she open the door or should she not?",
  "62924": "Now, while you have tyranny in so great a degree walled in, and see your enemies over your heads, to what purpose is it to take counsel?",
  "62925": "But don't you know the higher you climb, the colder it gets?",
  "62926": "You do not know that you love me?",
  "62927": "What in thunder has that to do with you?",
  "62928": "No one at home?",
  "62929": "How is it over?",
  "62930": "Is it business?",
  "62931": "What's a ball through the chest?",
  "62932": "Has he found time to tell you scandal about me?",
  "62933": "Well how can I help it?",
  "62934": "Is my master not here, sir?",
  "62935": "What has our providential rescue to do with altering your feelings toward me?",
  "62936": "Where is it now, the glory and the dream?",
  "62937": "When is one pleasure twice as great as another?",
  "62938": "Is marriage so demoralising as that?",
  "62939": "Did he take any luggage?",
  "62940": "Seeing the old man?",
  "62941": "But there were three races, were there not?",
  "62942": "Was it the effect of the balmy climate alone which recalled him to health?",
  "62943": "Is it paid for?",
  "62944": "Were you speaking of me?",
  "62945": "An emancipator?",
  "62946": "These are the orders, are they?",
  "62947": "Does SHE look like the mother of six?",
  "62948": "Who is the agent?",
  "62949": "What tilbury?",
  "62950": "How can we ever thank you?",
  "62951": "Is it probable?",
  "62952": "Kitchens?",
  "62953": "And then should not the charity be all the more profound, in proportion as the fall is great?",
  "62954": "How was he to get through his present difficulty?",
  "62955": "What have you to say?",
  "62956": "You know?",
  "62957": "Is there any place at liberty that you know of now, uncle, that I should do for?",
  "62958": "But, why should I conceal my sentiments?",
  "62959": "But won't you join me at supper, now 'tis waiting and all?",
  "62960": "Whom do you mean by THEY?",
  "62961": "Their graces?",
  "62962": "Shall I call him?",
  "62963": "How and why could it be mistaken?",
  "62964": "What the devil do you mean by this?",
  "62965": "If a man in selecting a residence, do not fix on one where such prevail, how can he be wise?",
  "62966": "Are you sure you don't hurt your hand, doing that?",
  "62967": "Well, mon cher, have you got the manifesto?",
  "62968": "How, you are going soon?",
  "62969": "So saying, he fixed his eyes upon me, and asked if I had seen him tremble?",
  "62970": "Isn't she enormous?",
  "62971": "But the man who was under him?",
  "62972": "Did he still cherish hope?",
  "62973": "Isn't it a dreadful feeling?",
  "62974": "Why funny?",
  "62975": "What have I done?",
  "62976": "Do you know much of him?",
  "62977": "Are you quite ready, gentlemen?",
  "62978": "To get what's left me sold by auction?",
  "62979": "What is to be done in these circumstances?",
  "62980": "Could he be sure that he was not their accomplice?",
  "62981": "Did the people shout at all?",
  "62982": "Excuse me,' and you believe that is sufficient?",
  "62983": "You aren't taking hoboes, are you?",
  "62984": "I daresay you've heard of her?",
  "62985": "Perhaps you'd care to come in and have a drink on your way?",
  "62986": "Must I receive it, or leave it in the hands of the notary?",
  "62987": "What is the meaning of that?",
  "62988": "Oh, you know him?",
  "62989": "Sir, have you finished supper?",
  "62990": "What did I get by that?",
  "62991": "What has become of the faith which has hitherto carried you so bravely through all our difficulties?",
  "62992": "Then what will you have me say?",
  "62993": "Missus's?",
  "62994": "How, then, am I mad?",
  "62995": "Could you possibly wish for a more favorable conjunction of circumstances?",
  "62996": "How should I know?",
  "62997": "What had been his object?",
  "62998": "And would that be all?",
  "62999": "Do you remember that after less than a year of married life you stood on the verge of an abyss?",
  "63000": "Aren't they really terrifying?",
  "63001": "Don't you see, now, what's the matter with that ha'nted room?",
  "63002": "Why should I die, then, or basely despair?",
  "63003": "And anyone else?",
  "63004": "And what did he tell 'ee next?",
  "63005": "Do you never feel sick of it?",
  "63006": "Was this precaution or humility?",
  "63007": "Any men on it?",
  "63008": "Was it possible they heard not?",
  "63009": "Why do men halt between two opinions, and expect impossibilities?",
  "63010": "What are you wanting?",
  "63011": "Why aren't you in bed?",
  "63012": "Will not the good people respond to a united and earnest appeal from us?",
  "63013": "Who could be suspected of this mischief?",
  "63014": "But why should I not receive her?",
  "63015": "But from whom is that letter?",
  "63016": "Have you them?",
  "63017": "What, gentlemen, is your verdict?",
  "63018": "What's a tall man unless he fight?",
  "63019": "Did that person not come back, then?",
  "63020": "Was there any other spirit but rum in the room?",
  "63021": "Do you wish to know clearly celestial matters, what they rightly are?",
  "63022": "Heavily?",
  "63023": "Do you want me to tear out my hair in handfuls?",
  "63024": "If the officer be accused of dishonesty, how shall it be made out?",
  "63025": "Where is the cure?",
  "63026": "Are you on the ground?",
  "63027": "You mentioned a fowl, I think?",
  "63028": "Upon what?",
  "63029": "Is not this an extraordinary tale?",
  "63030": "What are you meddling with my deeds for?",
  "63031": "Who is it, then, that you want to see?",
  "63032": "Is it to be yes at last?",
  "63033": "What made you think she would be here?",
  "63034": "WHO is in the room?",
  "63035": "What was there to be seen there?",
  "63036": "Was there left now nothing but to break off from the happy creative being, was the time up?",
  "63037": "You are not going out, uncle?",
  "63038": "What does it matter where it comes from?",
  "63039": "You are determined, then, to push your fortune in other lands?",
  "63040": "Ain't he played me tricks enough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time?",
  "63041": "Why should I be ashamed of myself?",
  "63042": "And there are four of you?",
  "63043": "How will it do, how will it do?",
  "63044": "Did you see the libraries and schools!?",
  "63045": "I should like to know whether you have the same notion which I have of this study?",
  "63046": "Who is going to dress me?",
  "63047": "Think of who?",
  "63048": "What is it you want to distract you?",
  "63049": "Whose beneficence was like his?",
  "63050": "Who taught her?",
  "63051": "It was not he, then, you came to seek?",
  "63052": "Who'll have her?",
  "63053": "Did you speak to him?",
  "63054": "Have you seen fifty frightful men pass down from the cliffs into this forest, my children?",
  "63055": "Will your ladyship stay the night?",
  "63056": "What can he be picking up?",
  "63057": "Then why on earth does she do it?",
  "63058": "How could this be, sir?",
  "63059": "Shall I tell you why?",
  "63060": "What is the day of the month?",
  "63061": "What shall become of me?",
  "63062": "Hasn't she come back yet?",
  "63063": "Well, have you made up your mind to this journey?",
  "63064": "And him you found?",
  "63065": "Did he get his brain fever, and then write all those terrible things, or had he some cause for it all?",
  "63066": "Was she young?",
  "63067": "Cosette?",
  "63068": "Have you seen?",
  "63069": "Where shall we go?",
  "63070": "Or what is this?",
  "63071": "Have you, indeed, my boy?",
  "63072": "Have you seen the general?",
  "63073": "But how should they know when the projectile had reached this neutral point situated at that distance, especially when neither themselves, nor the objects enclosed in the projectile, would be any longer subject to the laws of weight?",
  "63074": "What have you been doing during my absence?",
  "63075": "To you, eh?",
  "63076": "But can the musician by his art make men unmusical?",
  "63077": "Yet, when the sensibility is thus increased at the expense of reason, and even the imagination, why do philosophical men complain of their fickleness?",
  "63078": "Am I to suppose that you intend to lower yourself by marrying a young woman who cannot possibly have enjoyed any of the advantages of a lady's education?",
  "63079": "Well, and your guardian must be brave if he is to fight well?",
  "63080": "Has my girl any objection?",
  "63081": "Now, when the restriction is removed, what is to prevent it from going still farther?",
  "63082": "But, I say, do you make any progress in it?",
  "63083": "But who should less expect from you?",
  "63084": "Then how d'you know that we have the truth now?",
  "63085": "I would have you consider seriously of it?",
  "63086": "And what money 'ud he want?",
  "63087": "What would you have, sir?",
  "63088": "Were they asleep?",
  "63089": "Yet if he is not the maker, what is he in relation to the bed?",
  "63090": "Of complexion and brown hair?",
  "63091": "Have they contributed to encourage the diligence, and to improve the abilities, of the teachers?",
  "63092": "What about marriage?",
  "63093": "My friend, whom, then, will you serve?",
  "63094": "Did I forbid myself to think of him in any other light than as a paymaster?",
  "63095": "How is it that justice and isolation always accompany each other?",
  "63096": "And how is it to be parried?",
  "63097": "The rabbit?",
  "63098": "What could he have wanted there?",
  "63099": "Rob?",
  "63100": "So there is a hole?",
  "63101": "Why pay rent?",
  "63102": "Should he try to catch her eye, and then raise his hat?",
  "63103": "The first question is, whether music is or is not to make a part of education?",
  "63104": "Will you do me the favor to explain this enigma to me?",
  "63105": "Is there any other point which you would like to ask about?",
  "63106": "The bed might have been let down by some artificial means?",
  "63107": "But what are you up to?",
  "63108": "But what about you, and the rowing?",
  "63109": "Oh, why wasn't somebody kind to her?",
  "63110": "May I have a grill for dinner?",
  "63111": "What need he add to such a desperate proof in figures?",
  "63112": "Did you promise to marry her?",
  "63113": "Did you speculate any more?",
  "63114": "Haven't you your power of attorney?",
  "63115": "What, let me ask, is a man in and of himself?",
  "63116": "Why so much beating about the bush?",
  "63117": "Or am I not to know?",
  "63118": "What does your chamber open on?",
  "63119": "Come to where four roads meet?",
  "63120": "What's this round your neck?",
  "63121": "And which?",
  "63122": "Why do you want to do that at this particular time, when at every previous time that I have proposed it you have refused?",
  "63123": "What gallows?",
  "63124": "Do you think you can help me, dear grandpapa?",
  "63125": "Why do you sit out here all alone?",
  "63126": "O why was that so?",
  "63127": "You know what they say of my lodger?",
  "63128": "I wonder who 'tis?",
  "63129": "But if he gives you?",
  "63130": "What money is this?",
  "63131": "And would it be indiscreet to ask you the name of this powerful protector?",
  "63132": "I beg your pardon?",
  "63133": "What do you call liberty, monsieur?",
  "63134": "You'll mention that I called, perhaps?",
  "63135": "You notice my ring?",
  "63136": "What revenge?",
  "63137": "Won't you have an egg beaten up in a glass of milk while you're waiting?",
  "63138": "What say ye?",
  "63139": "Against your father?",
  "63140": "Is it all right in the new way?",
  "63141": "Are those horrid creatures gone?",
  "63142": "Why does he then exceed all bounds at once?",
  "63143": "How are you sure?",
  "63144": "Does any one live, who knows what set purposes you have, half as well as I do?",
  "63145": "Could it be that these were four words, and that they were intended to carry a message to me?",
  "63146": "There is nothing you desire?",
  "63147": "Will you let me make the tea?",
  "63148": "What else did he say to you?",
  "63149": "What is there in all that for me to think about?",
  "63150": "By pulling out a bar and pushing down a door?",
  "63151": "Aye?",
  "63152": "Well, miss?",
  "63153": "But what was to be done?",
  "63154": "Was the projectile under some foreign influence?",
  "63155": "Will you begin, if you please, and put in the thatch again, just as if you were doing it for your mother's cabin?",
  "63156": "Shall we not set forth?",
  "63157": "Do you, sir?",
  "63158": "Do you think this does?",
  "63159": "Do you think you could hustle something in the way of a little lunch, old man?",
  "63160": "What could this NN be?",
  "63161": "And how did he behave, madam?",
  "63162": "How much do you require for my ransom?",
  "63163": "If the possibility of passing the limits of experience be admitted, by means of the dynamical law of the relation of an effect to its cause, what kind of conception shall we obtain by this procedure?",
  "63164": "Wouldn't you like him to dribble into the great flood?",
  "63165": "But are your relatives so very poor?",
  "63166": "What is all this dancing up and down?",
  "63167": "If all were only vanity, who would mind it?",
  "63168": "Would I not give my life to secure it?",
  "63169": "But will his warriors consent?",
  "63170": "Why then should you expect me to pen this kind of affidavit, which has no object but to keep up a foolish partiality and secure a foolish bequest?",
  "63171": "But how did you proceed?",
  "63172": "What was it placed there for?",
  "63173": "Are YOU there?",
  "63174": "Or perhaps it is the pale morning light which takes your colour away?",
  "63175": "Why did you not bring it at once?",
  "63176": "The messenger that brought it, said would you be so good as read it by my lantern?",
  "63177": "If anyone arrives in my absence, do the honors for me, will you not?",
  "63178": "Has the breakfast been all right?",
  "63179": "Of what day?",
  "63180": "Has anyone?",
  "63181": "I trust you are in good health, and that your families are all well?",
  "63182": "Don't you see them, in that box far back?",
  "63183": "Was it the fall of some mighty pillar of the globe?",
  "63184": "Well, what now?",
  "63185": "Think?",
  "63186": "And the youth repented, and became a good man?",

  "66262": "What do you mean by that?",
  "66263": "What shall we learn from THAT stuff?",
  "66264": "Is it nearly finished?",
  "66265": "And where is my wife?",
  "66266": "Well, then, you made the boating man believe that he was the father, did you not?",
  "66267": "If society is binding on the boat, is it also binding on the provisions?",
  "66268": "But tell me, do you think I am so beautiful?",
  "66269": "What finer retinue could be expected for his funeral?",
  "66270": "And is it not the very diagnostic of true salvation that it shall overcome the fear of death?",
  "66271": "You do not mean to ride, gentlemen?",
  "66272": "May I mention something?",
  "66273": "Why don't you leave me alone?",
  "66274": "You understand how those things are managed?",
  "66275": "But what would become of this human imago in a state of perfect bliss?",
  "66276": "What are all systems, religious, political, or scientific, but opinions resting on evidence more or less satisfactory?",
  "66277": "Perhaps that you're searching far too much?",
  "66278": "And do you know whither he went?",
  "66279": "Did some marine monster come from time to time, to breathe at the bottom of this well?",
  "66280": "Then, of course, you can read and write quite correctly?",
  "66281": "Have we any of us any friends there?",
  "66282": "You wouldn't want any one to do you out of your chance to get your rights, would you?",
  "66283": "Then I shall be of no use to your majesty?",
  "66284": "When men are sore with the sense of oppressions, and menaced with the prospects of new ones, is the calmness of philosophy or the palsy of insensibility to be looked for?",
  "66285": "What did I care about paradise?",
  "66286": "And now how was I to proceed to reconstruct this midnight drama?",
  "66287": "It is, is it, sir?",
  "66288": "It doesn't seem likely she'd stop having them all at once when she's been so in the habit of it, does it?",
  "66289": "Wasn't it awful?",
  "66290": "Shall we try to catch it?",
  "66291": "Ah, could I then think that it is in that second nature that the soul is ordained to seek its trials, and that the elements of human virtue find their harmonious place?",
  "66292": "Where could she find it?",
  "66293": "Well, what have you proved?",
  "66294": "Don't the very greatest ladies of all talk about that small clique of persons to whom they belong?",
  "66295": "This way, or that way?",
  "66296": "Don't you think the fowl may have come out of the country, aunt?",
  "66297": "How did he strike you, prince?",
  "66298": "Have not your fathers taught you this, I say, whilst as yet ye were but children?",
  "66299": "Bounderby?",
  "66300": "But, it will be said, is this all that pure reason can effect, in opening up prospects beyond the limits of experience?",
  "66301": "Isn't that strange?",
  "66302": "Why cannot man be content to live alone and be happy, and let the women live alone and be happy too?",
  "66303": "Can equality, by the right of succession, be preserved between citizens, as well as between cousins and brothers?",
  "66304": "Ay, and ashamed of it too?",
  "66305": "Cadby's death was from drowning, you say?",
  "66306": "Where's this young lady I've been hearing such a lot about?",
  "66307": "Why, then, didn't you reply?",
  "66308": "And how did it happen?",
  "66309": "And you?",
  "66310": "Lor, if the devil don't get them, what's he good for?",
  "66311": "Do you think they are dead?",
  "66312": "Has it ever been done before?",
  "66313": "Who's that boy?",
  "66314": "Or do you know some reason why it suits your father's book to amalgamate as well as it suits mine?",
  "66315": "Had you not better light a candle?",
  "66316": "Do you know where he lives?",
  "66317": "Is there ony country where they talk i' that way?",
  "66318": "What did that mean, to kiss?",
  "66319": "And how was she to punish her?",
  "66320": "Tyler appointed him?",
  "66321": "Had the nervous strain resulted in a hallucination, or did the door really move?",
  "66322": "Could she not be brought for just one little instant?",
  "66323": "Can you see me?",
  "66324": "Then to put the question is to solve the problem?",
  "66325": "Can you row up?",
  "66326": "Holding up a bank?",
  "66327": "To meet you in this way, on the sly?",
  "66328": "And what's a sonne?",
  "66329": "What am I to say to him?",
  "66330": "And in the first place, he will honour studies which impress these qualities on his soul and disregard others?",
  "66331": "And you couldn't remember?",
  "66332": "Would I come and look at it?",
  "66333": "Did you remark the postmarks of those letters?",
  "66334": "Do you see what I meant about the clothes falling off?",
  "66335": "Where is your escort?",
  "66336": "Is it necessary, pray, to illustrate a remark in so practical a style?",
  "66337": "Would he go and describe his rough reception, or recount his exploit?",
  "66338": "What, in the name of everything hideous, did this mean?",
  "66339": "Are you going somewhere?",
  "66340": "Do you know her?",
  "66341": "What can have happened?",
  "66342": "I presume you know, gentlemen, to whom my friend is indebted for this piece of patronage?",
  "66343": "Among them odd heaps of old papers, this gentleman, when he comes into the property, naturally begins to rummage, don't you see?",
  "66344": "Why are you distressed?",
  "66345": "Are you going to have lunch too?",
  "66346": "And what is the means?",
  "66347": "And if I did know them now, what would it avail me?",
  "66348": "What would you have?",
  "66349": "Revels?",
  "66350": "Now will you believe I'm in earnest?",
  "66351": "Is the sun up?",
  "66352": "Oh, what's that?",
  "66353": "Is it the immediate object of this confidence, that you may at once ascertain that, with my knowledge?",
  "66354": "How large was it?",
  "66355": "Then had I not best send him about his business?",
  "66356": "What does it matter?",
  "66357": "Don't your store people trust you?",
  "66358": "Shall we invite him into our hearts?",
  "66359": "What have you done with her, then, if you have her no longer?",
  "66360": "Then you'll not be wanting me any more tonight, ma'am?",
  "66361": "Jane, do you hear that nightingale singing in the wood?",
  "66362": "Where could they be going?",
  "66363": "Won't you?",
  "66364": "Not in regular government pay and employment, to lay traps?",
  "66365": "But who could affirm, who would dare to say, that the amiable fellow did not really see that which his two companions would not see?",
  "66366": "You can't recommend anything for the boy, I suppose?",
  "66367": "What was it that she wanted of him?",
  "66368": "Where are the nearest?",
  "66369": "How has he drawn you to himself?",
  "66370": "Not even of sending me a scrap of stuff for a new dress?",
  "66371": "If he cuts off one of his own toes, or one of his assistants', would you be very much astonished?",
  "66372": "Was the weather hot or cold?",
  "66373": "Where was my baggage?",
  "66374": "Authority?",
  "66375": "Tell him or not tell him?",
  "66376": "O you will let me hold your brave hand, stranger?",
  "66377": "You think so, my lord?",
  "66378": "In your left ear?",
  "66379": "Am I a soothsayer?",
  "66380": "Who shall live up to the great trust?",
  "66381": "Are we there already?",
  "66382": "And my council dares to temper and negotiate?",
  "66383": "How are you?",
  "66384": "But what?",
  "66385": "It was you, was it not?",
  "66386": "Am I not by?",
  "66387": "Have you given up loving her altogether?",
  "66388": "What good does it do?",
  "66389": "You have never heard her nephew play?",
  "66390": "And what is thy want?",
  "66391": "What sin, mademoiselle?",
  "66392": "Or that it is impossible to draw more than one right line betwixt any two points?",
  "66393": "Do you think I could ever skip like that?",
  "66394": "Can you send me to the station?",
  "66395": "When did you leave service?",
  "66396": "Well, what do you think of that?",
  "66397": "What DO you know of him?",
  "66398": "What good will he be to the tribe?",
  "66399": "What, did you come digging here entirely because of me?",
  "66400": "Do you feel that you have lost her?",
  "66401": "What, senor?",
  "66402": "Or the raspberry?",
  "66403": "What is there?",
  "66404": "What have you been after?",
  "66405": "You don't mean to say he stole money, do you?",
  "66406": "But who are all these?",
  "66407": "Well, what d'you think of it?",
  "66408": "Oh, I?",
  "66409": "You couldn't write?",
  "66410": "You here again?",
  "66411": "You have no trouble, I hope, to keep you waking?",
  "66412": "What is, or was, their address?",
  "66413": "But of what disease, then, did she die?",
  "66414": "Trodden upon by whom?",
  "66415": "Mighty men?",
  "66416": "No, but what do you mean?",
  "66417": "Yes, I am out of temper, and do you know why?",
  "66418": "Did you ever hear anything like your brother's eloquence?",
  "66419": "And what is the use of a fellow having a little money if it does not make him independent?",
  "66420": "Why have you no pride?",
  "66421": "Who are you, that you are to play with two young people's affections and break their hearts at your will?",
  "66422": "Yes?",
  "66423": "You mean, will it be prudent?",
  "66424": "What is justice?",
  "66425": "How so?",
  "66426": "Weren't you listening to me?",
  "66427": "What's in it?",
  "66428": "Did he himself find no cause for laughter on the earth?",
  "66429": "And who completed it as it now is?"
