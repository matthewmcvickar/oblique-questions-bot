  "1501": "What does it contain?",
  "1502": "Why should it break three inches from the top, as this one has done?",
  "1503": "Was it last evening that you came on board this vessel?",
  "1504": "And why not a bowl of rack punch as well as any other cause?",
  "1505": "Would it be some young man or other whom she takes an interest in?",
  "1506": "Is it absolutely necessary to go on with the letter, darling?",
  "1507": "Is that a genuine letter you are reading?",
  "1508": "What could be better?",
  "1509": "What has she been telling you?",
  "1510": "Why is that little, and the little freedom they enjoy, to be infringed?",

  "1512": "Will she recover?",
  "1513": "Is that what you mean?",
  "1514": "But now that virtue has become to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into bitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy?",

  "1527": "So that I need not make use of this petition?",
  "1528": "But what do you conclude from that, father?",

  "1558": "Lost confidence?",
  "1559": "How could he have chosen a better friend in whom to trust?",
  "1560": "In the same way?",
  "1561": "What was your remark, my dear friend?",
  "1562": "Why do you answer me so roughly?",
  "1563": "What's going to become of us now?",

  "4606": "Where do you want him?",
  "4607": "Why did I bind myself to her?",
  "4608": "What, then, is there surprising in that?",
  "4609": "Did he die?",
  "4610": "How was she?",
  "4611": "Now about tonight?",
  "4612": "You went there in obedience to a letter of instructions?",
  "4613": "Who is he?",
  "4614": "Why do you return so early?",
  "4615": "Lots of tin, I suppose, eh?",
  "4616": "At the anvil?",
  "4617": "Asked him for?",
  "4618": "But what has this to do with the picture?",
  "4619": "What's the matter with you girls?",
  "4620": "Then why do they quarrel?",
  "4621": "Can we then for a moment believe that, if this had been so, tradition would have been absolutely silent on the matter?",
  "4622": "Is the power of declaring war necessary?",
  "4623": "Even if he enjoys peace and a truce with you and all your men, what matters that to me?",
  "4624": "The last governess?",
  "4625": "I wonder if that will have a good effect?",
  "4626": "What horrible place are we in?",
  "4627": "Then there is no revenge?",
  "4628": "Do you imagine such a thing?",
  "4629": "You will do for me what you have done for the queen?",
  "4630": "Have you lived with the family long?",
  "4631": "Want to break up the line?",
  "4632": "Mercy, did you say?",
  "4633": "How is SHE?",
  "4634": "You saw me, perhaps, on the night of the convict hunt, when I was so imprudent as to allow the moon to rise behind me?",
  "4635": "Where are the gloves?",
  "4636": "Am I to understand that you say you love me?",
  "4637": "Is that clear?",
  "4638": "How be ye?",
  "4639": "Ah, by my crown, what's that?",
  "4640": "Are you glad to see me?",
  "4641": "What is our life but the very worst life?",
  "4642": "Well, what is to be done?",
  "4643": "Badly made up?",
  "4644": "What would happen?",
  "4645": "But, once more, how is that my fault?",
  "4646": "Until now?",
  "4647": "Is he an old offender?",
  "4648": "Which of these do we take?",
  "4649": "What old cove?",
  "4650": "Do you want us to fling ourselves headlong down these rocks?",
  "4651": "How long shall they wield unlawful power?",

  "4653": "In what figure shall I give his heart the first impression?",
  "4654": "The inquiry being only into the circumstances touching the death of the deceased, it's not necessary to go beyond these facts, I suppose you'll agree?",
  "4655": "Have you knocked at that one?",
  "4656": "Today, this moment?",
  "4657": "Or had he in reality always been like this, commonplace and prosaic, and was it merely in her imagination that he had been wonderful?",
  "4658": "Have you only just come?",
  "4659": "What man?",
  "4660": "Why do the women wear these things?",
  "4661": "Given the laboratories, how are the investigators to be maintained?",
  "4662": "All ready there?",
  "4663": "Why should we not leave together?",
  "4664": "What did you do then, sir?",
  "4665": "What was the ebb and flow of this tragic meditation?",
  "4666": "Then you want me to go back there?",
  "4667": "But do they do right in ignoring the existence of violence and bloodshed in resistance to constituted authority?",
  "4668": "Harness, but how can I harness everything?",
  "4669": "How cruel is your goodness?",
  "4670": "But what good will it do?",
  "4671": "What will protect him?",
  "4672": "How can I be sure of this?",
  "4673": "What's death?",
  "4674": "What was amiss?",
  "4675": "Where are you going to dine then?",
  "4676": "What could you do?",
  "4677": "If he could not do it, and if, nevertheless, it behoved them to break off this match, by whom was it to be done if not by her?",
  "4678": "A monkey, then?",
  "4679": "Have you any idea who did?",
  "4680": "Who made the lemonade?",
  "4681": "How shall he stop all the holes and deliver himself from the vipers?",
  "4682": "And why should that particular hole in the ground have anything to do with it?",
  "4683": "Why did the doctor's wife give the clerk presents?",
  "4684": "Am I doing anything?",
  "4685": "What did you think?",
  "4686": "Is it all you expected of it?",
  "4687": "What is it that you know?",
  "4688": "Do you not think so?",
  "4689": "Is, then, the crown too heavy that I wear?",
  "4690": "Does he want to protect himself, or does he think I would not go alone?",
  "4691": "Has law and order come down to this?",
  "4692": "And have you had a good bonfire up there?",
  "4693": "What is the economical meaning of wages?",
  "4694": "What do we want of a saw?",
  "4695": "Shall I sew, read, cone, draw, or do all at once?",
  "4696": "How call you the fountain?",
  "4697": "Yea?",
  "4698": "Who would be left?",
  "4699": "And, if so, how far into the future should we look?",
  "4700": "You have seen inside, then?",
  "4701": "And what did I do?",
  "4702": "What good will it do?",
  "4703": "Would you let me fetch another pat of butter, ma'am?",
  "4704": "Where's some brandy?",
  "4705": "Do you think he'll do it?",
  "4706": "Or will a not fail when he does come?",
  "4707": "Has there been any mistake, has she been buried alive?",
  "4708": "Yes, why was it that he had not married?",
  "4709": "Have I not indeed been living in a dream?",
  "4710": "But you, my poor child?",
  "4711": "Who could resist the pleading of so wise and compassionate a judge?",
  "4712": "How long are you staying?",
  "4713": "What on earth is the matter with the boy?",
  "4714": "I said just now, what good could come of it?",
  "4715": "May be a fraud?",
  "4716": "What's an engagement made of, do you suppose?",
  "4717": "I suppose you will be glad of variety and admiration?",
  "4718": "Do you think you can recover your lord by giving away thus to your grief?",
  "4719": "But where is the use?",
  "4720": "You're not going?",
  "4721": "With no work to do, nobody to worry us, and nobody to compete with?",
  "4722": "I know I've had it a long time, but where did I get it?",
  "4723": "Is she alone?",
  "4724": "What had taken place during this long sleep?",
  "4725": "When, finally, he was graduated a captain as well as a soldier, to what object should he address his efforts?",
  "4726": "Am I, or am I not, the queen?",
  "4727": "Could he do what he wanted to with the dollar?",
  "4728": "Because they give fevers?",
  "4729": "Where is she that I loved, the woman with eyes like stars?",
  "4730": "Now, then, mum?",
  "4731": "Who by?",
  "4732": "How can they laugh, or even live at all here?",
  "4733": "Who came here the last time?",
  "4734": "But what color can the objection have, when a specification of the objects alluded to by these general terms immediately follows, and is not even separated by a longer pause than a semicolon?",
  "4735": "What about poaching eggs?",
  "4736": "You know not the subject of their conversation?",
  "4737": "You would not fight a duel?",
  "4738": "Worth it, the little sacrifice, for whom?",
  "4739": "Is my son dead or unhorsed or so wounded that he cannot help himself?",
  "4740": "What about those rings you told me of?",
  "4741": "Little bamboos that creak together, tell me where he ran?",
  "4742": "Want a pilot, captain?",
  "4743": "There, what do you think now of the affair?",
  "4744": "Was there anything in your letter which might have unbalanced him or induced him to take such a step?",
  "4745": "How long was I what they called out of my senses?",
  "4746": "I am having a great holiday, am I not?",
  "4747": "In what strain should he do so?",
  "4748": "What was their case?",
  "4749": "Was your sister dressed?",
  "4750": "Where has he gone?",
  "4751": "What does it signify?",
  "4752": "And what did he do the rest of his time?",
  "4753": "What do you mean, then?",
  "4754": "You're not angry that I sent for you?",
  "4755": "Might I have a word with your lordship?",
  "4756": "But what had been in the box?",
  "4757": "May I prove my gratitude by explaining for once where my difficulty lies?",
  "4758": "And do you suppose, madam, that he would have no money left?",
  "4759": "Do you not see that all these soldiers of ours have been raised by us to the pitch of expectation?",
  "4760": "I afraid?",
  "4761": "Did you ever love such an one?",
  "4762": "And will the head's being bare cure the madness of yours?",
  "4763": "Is it worth while?",
  "4764": "Will you be good enough to come and see me?",
  "4765": "She is ready, is she?",
  "4766": "From whom else could they come?",
  "4767": "You do not need that name in order to live?",
  "4768": "What has he done?",
  "4769": "Have you done this?",
  "4770": "Was he one of those two passengers?",
  "4771": "What is to become of us?",
  "4772": "Give every one their due, eh?",
  "4773": "What stone wall?",
  "4774": "How could I adore her more if I were married to one of the people you speak of?",
  "4775": "Do you think so?",
  "4776": "By what oaths can he bind himself?",
  "4777": "Will monseigneur have the kindness to say for what purpose?",
  "4778": "Of what burden is she?",
  "4779": "Do I amuse you?",
  "4780": "Come, is that enough, mamma, or do you intend to put any more questions?",
  "4781": "A lost art?",
  "4782": "Are you one of his men?",
  "4783": "Criminals?",
  "4784": "Who was the he?",
  "4785": "Why did you wish to stop my ears?",
  "4786": "Have you forgiven me?",
  "4787": "Will you refuse to do as I wish?",
  "4788": "Well, what did he talk about with you?",
  "4789": "Where is the forest man who went to rescue you?",
  "4790": "And what is the time limit for such reactions?",
  "4791": "But if, in the dawn of life, we could soberly survey the scenes before us as in perspective, and see every thing in its true colours, how could the passions gain sufficient strength to unfold the faculties?",
  "4792": "Will you not speak to me?",
  "4793": "What hour?",
  "4794": "What has brought him here at this time?",
  "4795": "I think I saw you in the park riding?",
  "4796": "Are we not?",
  "4797": "Why should love be a bond?",
  "4798": "And if you found him deserting to your enemies, what would you do?",
  "4799": "Who could have told you that?",
  "4800": "Why do we not arrive?",
  "4801": "Then, after all, it was given to me by the dean?",
  "4802": "May I have her at my party?",
  "4803": "But who said it was buried alive?",
  "4804": "May I call tomorrow?",
  "4805": "What was that?",
  "4806": "My wish?",
  "4807": "What's to do naow?",
  "4808": "I ask you, sir, how dare you do it?",
  "4809": "What have you gained?",
  "4810": "How have we handled our national finances?",
  "4811": "But if he be willing to accept my offers, will you oppose them?",
  "4812": "The next question of anxiety was, where would the balloon alight?",
  "4813": "She?",
  "4814": "How could you sing, sing like that while crying?",
  "4815": "My line?",
  "4816": "But will it hurt me?",
  "4817": "So you want to marry?",
  "4818": "How is that, my friend?",
  "4819": "Can destiny, then, be as malicious as an intelligent being, and become as monstrous as the human heart?",
  "4820": "What difference does that make?",
  "4821": "Would you be able to recognize that man again?",
  "4822": "And who the devil gave YOU leave to touch a stick about the place?",
  "4823": "You supposed he should have hung himself indeed?",
  "4824": "Of what kind were they?",
  "4825": "Have you a brother?",
  "4826": "Can you tell how?",
  "4827": "What the devil do you come in between me and my dog for?",
  "4828": "Did you see?",
  "4829": "I presume then that you are going to make one of the interdicted answers?",
  "4830": "And I?",
  "4831": "And good counsel is clearly a kind of knowledge, for not by ignorance, but by knowledge, do men counsel well?",
  "4832": "Do you understand me?",
  "4833": "Have not almost all the governments in the world always been in the wrong on religious subjects?",
  "4834": "Why do you make so much noise?",
  "4835": "Against whom?",
  "4836": "What was to be done in the rural districts?",
  "4837": "Ah, how many inhabitants could it support?",
  "4838": "And which to the mortal?",
  "4839": "But what do you make of the grandmother?",
  "4840": "How have we offended?",
  "4841": "And what about her?",
  "4842": "What business have you here?",
  "4843": "Is it just?",
  "4844": "What is that you say, my friend?",
  "4845": "Do you really?",
  "4846": "But what sort of a man was he?",
  "4847": "No use?",
  "4848": "Your real name you will not give?",
  "4849": "Has he not compounded a riddle, thinking to try me?",
  "4850": "And what shall we say about men?",
  "4851": "Have you no shame?",
  "4852": "Why weep you not to think upon my wrongs?",
  "4853": "Stranger, what is it?",
  "4854": "What shall I suffer and endure?",
  "4855": "Maybe you'll be very lonely, ma'am?",
  "4856": "What is it, little girl?",
  "4857": "But may not the tradition of it have descended from the discovery of comparatively late remains, by primitive man, of the winged saurians that crawled, swam, dived, or flew, lingering on till the later geologic period?",
  "4858": "The lady, sir?",
  "4859": "Oats?",
  "4860": "How long could they keep the pace?",
  "4861": "His uncle had deceived him, and might he not consign her to some miserable place where her youth and beauty would prove a far greater curse than ugliness and decrepitude?",
  "4862": "Who do you wish to see?",
  "4863": "How long is this for?",
  "4864": "What conceivable motive had they for doing so?",
  "4865": "Which way is the business part?",
  "4866": "And dressed?",
  "4867": "Why, cousin?",
  "4868": "Make you feel rotten?",
  "4869": "Do I ever take pains to have any secrets?",
  "4870": "Did you ever see her?",
  "4871": "How do you like my entrance?",
  "4872": "Can you rest here?",
  "4873": "Cruel?",
  "4874": "Will you never do anything?",
  "4875": "Beneath it?",
  "4876": "Is such a thing possible?",
  "4877": "Sorry for whom?",
  "4878": "Your leagues concluded, your engagements past?",
  "4879": "Why does he not come himself?",
  "4880": "Is anything the matter?",
  "4881": "Of what misdemeanor do you accuse him?",
  "4882": "And who did it?",
  "4883": "Only think what you are giving up here?",
  "4884": "And what would you call her?",
  "4885": "The boy is out, you say?",
  "4886": "What can make her amends for this privation, or where is she to seek for a fresh employment?",
  "4887": "But what's the southern army to do?",
  "4888": "What was passing in that brain, so loaded with dreadful secrets?",
  "4889": "Are you sure she said that?",
  "4890": "I do not know whether you have heard the whole story?",
  "4891": "How near were you?",
  "4892": "Surprise?",
  "4893": "And why should you object?",
  "4894": "But what are men?",
  "4895": "It that noble?",
  "4896": "Oh, what shall I call you?",
  "4897": "Will you come out with me again one evening?",
  "4898": "Then who is supporting you there?",
  "4899": "What is the difference, then, between the two customs?",
  "4900": "I wonder, captain, what they will say of my going away, ha?",
  "4901": "In such a world as this, what is the use of the enjoyment of pleasures, if he who has fed on them is to return to this world again and again?",
  "4902": "Why did you introduce a defective bill?",
  "4903": "And why then have you tempted me?",
  "4904": "And his name?",
  "4905": "Did he get well?",
  "4906": "Lend me a hanky, will you?",
  "4907": "Would you know how to buy it, my darling?",
  "4908": "When the tongue of an advocate once gets in motion, who can tell where it will stop?",
  "4909": "What was this?",
  "4910": "Is there any enjoyment in it, if his opinion is that he is aggrieved?",
  "4911": "Was it not the strongest wish of his heart that I should adopt his own career?",
  "4912": "Of what consequence?",
  "4913": "Would you like me to get out the books now that your grandmother is going to give you for your birthday?",
  "4914": "What is it, then?",
  "4915": "Well, how are you?",
  "4916": "You've come back, have you?",
  "4917": "Now, if I grant that they cannot be employed in the sphere of experience, as constitutive principles, how shall I secure for them employment and objective validity as regulative principles, and in what way can they be so employed?",
  "4918": "How long have you had that cough ?",
  "4919": "Would you turn their distress into a malediction?",
  "4920": "Of what did the plebeians complain?",
  "4921": "Giry, do you know what is in this envelope?",
  "4922": "Are you sure of this?",
  "4923": "Or five?",
  "4924": "But how about the wine?",
  "4925": "Must I go in immediately?",
  "4926": "BROWN?",
  "4927": "See, now, my jealous lord, do I address such questions to you?",
  "4928": "What are laborers in relation to each other?",
  "4929": "What scoundrel struck that blow?",
  "4930": "I mean, would you have wished to paint her?",
  "4931": "You receive stolen goods, do you?",
  "4932": "What had he, a family man, to do with ventures beyond sea?",
  "4933": "Will you please tell him that a lady wishes to see him?",
  "4934": "A wa'at for me?",
  "4935": "Was there enough ice?",
  "4936": "But where will they lead us to?",
  "4937": "A fright?",
  "4938": "How can I help that, my boy?",
  "4939": "Can you have become untrue to your own heart?",
  "4940": "How then, sir, can I act, but by shewing my abhorrence of every step that makes towards my undoing?",
  "4941": "And you will not turn aside as you did just now?",
  "4942": "How is it?",
  "4943": "Said he, what's the matter?",
  "4944": "And was it not the manly thing for him to do?",
  "4945": "Was that kind?",
  "4946": "Is ever disaster nearer than when each solider thinks about his private safety only?",
  "4947": "Are you all clear, you, aft there?",
  "4948": "That is perhaps true, but what of it?",
  "4949": "Where may he be at present?",
  "4950": "Menneville, what do you want to do?",
  "4951": "But this coffer?",
  "4952": "The main question is, which of the two parents is more to be had in honour?",
  "4953": "We were too rich, were we?",
  "4954": "Are we not bound to carry our investigations to extremity?",
  "4955": "Can you read?",
  "4956": "What were we the worse for the former folly?",
  "4957": "Could I speak to you alone for a moment?",
  "4958": "Oh, you're the new articled clerk?",
  "4959": "What right thing?",
  "4960": "Stendhal?",
  "4961": "Will you go?",
  "4962": "Why, then, do you fear them?",
  "4963": "O how shall I know this?",
  "4964": "You want to see who they are?",
  "4965": "What stayed them?",
  "4966": "And I've got a tremendous will, have I?",
  "4967": "Oh, something in a philanthropic way?",
  "4968": "Oh, but how was it?",
  "4969": "But where are we drifting?",
  "4970": "But what were our managers doing?",
  "4971": "You are come to tell us it is time to be gone, have you not?",
  "4972": "Was the man a magician?",
  "4973": "Her brother?",
  "4974": "Do you not see what feigned prices, are set upon little stones and rarities?",
  "4975": "What, are there any greater still?",
  "4976": "Is she your cousin?",
  "4977": "What mystery could be hidden under this sign?",
  "4978": "To the cottage of her sister?",
  "4979": "A pipe ?",
  "4980": "Do I delight to die, or life desire?",
  "4981": "Why are you in low spirits?",
  "4982": "And you will leave me then?",
  "4983": "Was it an illusion, a mistake, an optical illusion?",
  "4984": "What principle of good faith, then, was violated?",
  "4985": "Looking toward our house?",
  "4986": "Will you be quiet, then?",
  "4987": "Who am I?",
  "4988": "Is it for you, who keep an inn, to treat passengers at this rate?",
  "4989": "And did you see him?",
  "4990": "Supposing, for instance, that they should suddenly hail a taxi?",
  "4991": "Have you anything interesting there?",
  "4992": "And you found yourselves suddenly on a mountain side?",
  "4993": "Why do you ever come back, then, at all?",
  "4994": "Will that be all?",
  "4995": "But what did I want crawling forward to scorch my understanding at her flaming brow?",
  "4996": "But if there were somewhere a being strong and beautiful, a valiant nature, full at once of exaltation and refinement, a poet's heart in an angel's form, a lyre with sounding chords ringing out elegiac epithalamia to heaven, why, perchance, should she not find him?",
  "4997": "You have only lately arrived?",
  "4998": "I shall have the comte's letter in eight hours?",
  "4999": "How can we with mortal eyes contemplate this image, whose celestial splendor the host of heaven presumes not to behold?",
  "5000": "How can it affect them?",
  "5001": "Ever seen one like it?",
  "5002": "How have I done what I have done?",
  "5003": "Do you see that bath behind you?",
  "5004": "Knight, will you suffer this?",
  "5005": "That which is on high at the summit, at the crest, at the zenith, that which sends down so much light on the earth, sees but little, sees badly, sees not at all?",
  "5006": "What length was it?",
  "5007": "What are we all miserable for, when everything might be so happy?",
  "5008": "What did he say to me?",
  "5009": "I'm afraid you are ill?",
  "5010": "Why should she have been less prone to love than he was?",
  "5011": "In what time?",
  "5012": "How was it known that these letters were from me?",
  "5013": "Surely I never led you to expect such a thing?",
  "5014": "And is he aware of the danger he has been in?",
  "5015": "But why had his father taken up the board?",
  "5016": "What has become of him?",
  "5017": "And are not your own very lives in my hands?",
  "5018": "But we shall see you soon again, shall we not?",
  "5019": "I missed again?",
  "5020": "Am I boring you with all this?",
  "5021": "Are they, do you think?",
  "5022": "Do you realize that it's all your fault?",
  "5023": "My dear fellow, how are you?",
  "5024": "What does he appear to be?",
  "5025": "What were you doing?",
  "5026": "What is the relative age of this hymn?",
  "5027": "But if your honor knew this man?",
  "5028": "Do you think the lemon juice did any good?",
  "5029": "Am I to believe that?",
  "5030": "But your writing?",
  "5031": "Well, do you hear, sirrah?",
  "5032": "Was it in this room that you gave your instructions as to the copying of the document?",
  "5033": "How comes it that a true and cordial fraternity has not arrested on the one side and on the other the effects of pride and labor?",
  "5034": "What do you mean, sir?",
  "5035": "Do you wish this to live?",
  "5036": "What more can they pretend?",
  "5037": "Has anything escaped me?",
  "5038": "Ever kicked downstairs?",
  "5039": "Is it possible to abolish property in land in our age?",
  "5040": "Now how in the world did it get here?",
  "5041": "And what will you say to him, beloved?",
  "5042": "Then the just is happy, and the unjust miserable?",
  "5043": "In favour of the temperate men?",
  "5044": "Why not like that?",
  "5045": "Did you not hear me?",
  "5046": "Indeed, how can he, when they but follow his own vile example?",
  "5047": "Now, what must we conclude with respect to such sexual differences as these?",
  "5048": "What boots it singing on?",
  "5049": "Why do you start and look pale at my words?",
  "5050": "Cannot I serve you as a waiting maid?",
  "5051": "Was it mere fancy?",
  "5052": "Were you not saying that he too makes, not the idea which, according to our view, is the essence of the bed, but only a particular bed?",
  "5053": "Why, what are they thinking upon, sir?",
  "5054": "Shall we go forward?",
  "5055": "I suppose you quite agree with them, prince?",
  "5056": "Am I not right?",
  "5057": "And after the police?",
  "5058": "Have you a place you would like to put him in?",
  "5059": "Well, then, how am I free?",
  "5060": "A mere drudge?",
  "5061": "And who put the torpedo there?",
  "5062": "This is the triumph I was to have, is it?",
  "5063": "What new conditions?",
  "5064": "Are we wrong?",
  "5065": "How can we help loving and dwelling upon its recollections?",
  "5066": "Do you not know him?",
  "5067": "My good sir, is this man a hero, or a criminal?",
  "5068": "You would not change your lot for that of a king?",
  "5069": "Well, you will not tell us?",
  "5070": "She could hardly believe as much, but why did he not write?",
  "5071": "If so, state all he said, as nearly as you can?",
  "5072": "A race?",
  "5073": "The question suggests itself, may there not be present, even in blindly impulsive action, something faintly corresponding to desire and will?",
  "5074": "Would you like to see him?",
  "5075": "Or did they interpret our spurts of fire, the sudden stinging of our shells, our steady investment of their encampment, as we should the furious unanimity of onslaught in a disturbed hive of bees?",
  "5076": "And how are you?",
  "5077": "Why send it away?",
  "5078": "What's the hurry?",
  "5079": "How should you know that?",
  "5080": "Very handsome still?",
  "5081": "Would you like to see a little of it?",
  "5082": "May I presume to ask whether you have long possessed it?",
  "5083": "Well, waiving that, as she is nothing to me, and virtuously married to another man, why should she come troubling us?",
  "5084": "And what on earth are you going to do with it?",
  "5085": "Why so hard?",
  "5086": "Have they loved me?",
  "5087": "Ah, but you mean here, at your own home?",
  "5088": "How am I to get in?",
  "5089": "Then he who is a good keeper of anything is also a good thief?",
  "5090": "Will you ask him what kind was his son?",
  "5091": "Ey?",
  "5092": "The one in blue?",
  "5093": "Lordy, what did you do?",
  "5094": "So you'll not tell, will you?",
  "5095": "Why did he not bring it to me here?",
  "5096": "What is all that noise?",
  "5097": "Has he escaped?",
  "5098": "Have you got him?",
  "5099": "Has he a mother?",
  "5100": "Would he carry him on with him?",
  "5101": "You mean that you think there was no accident?",
  "5102": "Why, dear?",
  "5103": "How badly?",
  "5104": "Why should he not go to the home of his fathers?",
  "5105": "Is that all he does?",
  "5106": "Ah, where in the world have there been greater follies than with the pitiful?",
  "5107": "But what is the latest news of him?",
  "5108": "You know we want some help in the servant staff of the hospital?",
  "5109": "Of money?",
  "5110": "Who will plant the flag on the barricade again?",
  "5111": "Was the fire wholly extinct there?",
  "5112": "Why did you originally go away from me?",
  "5113": "How did this come about?",
  "5114": "What do I know about arms or supports?",
  "5115": "What does she make a sham for, and pretend to give me money, and take it away again?",
  "5116": "And was this conference arranged beforehand?",
  "5117": "Yet, to show my ingenuity rather than wit, would not a less model have given a full representation of that subject, not by diminution but by contraction of parts?",
  "5118": "Wherefore should I hold, good fellow?",
  "5119": "What have you done with your fur?",
  "5120": "Is not that true?",
  "5121": "And do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to her daughters, than to us?",
  "5122": "But why must I promise that?",
  "5123": "And what do you know?",
  "5124": "Will you have it so, or will you share your lover's punishment?",
  "5125": "How could a readiness for war in time of peace be safely prohibited, unless we could prohibit, in like manner, the preparations and establishments of every hostile nation?",
  "5126": "And why on earth does she want to speak to me at all?",
  "5127": "What did you do it for?",
  "5128": "What can I do to serve you?",
  "5129": "What reason had you to strike the man who won my daughter?",
  "5130": "What good is arguments to me?",
  "5131": "And who escapes his lot?",
  "5132": "How is she looking?",
  "5133": "Why so?",
  "5134": "What did he wish for?",
  "5135": "Would she take it as a joke?",
  "5136": "And is she not effectually degraded?",
  "5137": "Final for couples?",
  "5138": "They must be sold, I suppose?",
  "5139": "But what shall I do?",
  "5140": "Who can tell what a dark, dreary, hopeless life I have dragged on for months past?",
  "5141": "What could be the trouble in that quarter?",
  "5142": "What does it matter, after all?",
  "5143": "What is the result of it?",
  "5144": "Did you hear that cry?",
  "5145": "Did you ever see such a large peach in all your life?",
  "5146": "How much are you to give him?",
  "5147": "How many?",
  "5148": "Everything as it used to be?",
  "5149": "And how may that be?",
  "5150": "Are you comfortable?",
  "5151": "Can there be a rational adjustment of the claims of each?",
  "5152": "Father, that money is mine, why should I speak to you about that?",
  "5153": "Surely, sweet, it shall never be our dwelling?",
  "5154": "If he is it's not much good my coming, is it?",
  "5155": "Would those stiff trees that had outlived the eagle, turn young and airy pages to him, to skip on his errands when he bade them?",
  "5156": "What is their story?",
  "5157": "At what hour shall we come?",
  "5158": "Have you any tips to give us before we clear out?",
  "5159": "Which is the principal aim of these three?",
  "5160": "Does not the word express more than the fact, and must not the actual, whatever a man may think, always, in the nature of things, fall short of the truth?",
  "5161": "That's to you, I suppose, child?",
  "5162": "How must I arrange it, then?",
  "5163": "Is it really?",
  "5164": "Do you want any assistance?",
  "5165": "Yes, and is there a rope handy?",
  "5166": "Do you think it would be good for you?",
  "5167": "Suppose I handed you over to the police?",
  "5168": "And is the art of war one of those arts in which she can or can not share?",
  "5169": "And when did you arrive here?",
  "5170": "But how did he procure his books?",
  "5171": "You know her only son died eight years ago?",
  "5172": "How far do you purpose to extend your walk?",
  "5173": "At once?",
  "5174": "You do not like it, then?",
  "5175": "Non es eques, quare?",
  "5176": "Boys, ma'am?",
  "5177": "Has he asked you to give me the message?",
  "5178": "Some holy book, no doubt?",
  "5179": "Is it possible that one can forget and forsake what he once loved?",
  "5180": "Shall I put myself into the harness to be worn out like an old horse?",
  "5181": "You come from the contractor, you say?",
  "5182": "Why do you do it?",
  "5183": "Am I never to hear the last of this?",
  "5184": "You say that these thirteen millions are found to be wanting in the accounts?",
  "5185": "Then why not admit that these may be replaced some day by other moral intuitions to be evolved in an unknown future?",
  "5186": "What of yourself?",
  "5187": "Surely there must be someone among all of you here who will turn this shameless creature out of the room?",
  "5188": "What on earth is the use of time to a fellow who has twice as much of it as he knows what to do with?",
  "5189": "Or had he found something he wished to keep to himself?",
  "5190": "And how do these wiseacres know that man wants a normal, a virtuous choice?",
  "5191": "Why not furnish an unequivocal explanation of its object?",
  "5192": "Do you see that mainmast there?",
  "5193": "Any letters for me?",
  "5194": "Why are you so upset?",
  "5195": "Have you never felt the romance of that love?",
  "5196": "An explanation, pray, of what?",
  "5197": "And how on earth do they get at it?",
  "5198": "Do they get you bairns?",
  "5199": "Cannot one find friends among the animals, and choose some tame kid or eloquent parrot or amiable monkey?",
  "5200": "You wish to exchange crosses?",
  "5201": "Well, and did you like it very much?",
  "5202": "Would you mind describing him to me?",
  "5203": "But do you understand the mission you are fulfilling?",
  "5204": "What do YOU mean, mother?",
  "5205": "How about accidents?",
  "5206": "Do you think this is the end?",
  "5207": "Doing well, I suppose?",
  "5208": "What doth it profit to argue about hidden and dark things, concerning which we shall not be even reproved in the judgment, because we knew them not?",
  "5209": "Where 'bouts do you live?",
  "5210": "And then, mother?",
  "5211": "Do you sometimes think that I took an unfair advantage of your weakness?",
  "5212": "In what way did you mean it, sir?",
  "5213": "What did the gentleman say to her, my sonny?",
  "5214": "Did he name no one in his passion?",
  "5215": "What kind of political ambition was to result from this destructive political education?",
  "5216": "He knows them, then?",
  "5217": "Could narrow passages spread from it through the foundations of the island?",
  "5218": "Suppose we were to meet any of them?",
  "5219": "Have you anything?",
  "5220": "And what is the cause of this?",
  "5221": "Or flatter sorry bunglers?",
  "5222": "By my orders?",
  "5223": "So you do not plead guilty?",
  "5224": "Now, are not you fancying, gentlemen, that I am expressing remorse for something now, that I am asking your forgiveness for something?",
  "5225": "Would a man grow weary of such a look turned on him, of such arms held out?",
  "5226": "Why does she give me notice when it's too late?",
  "5227": "Why then do we not follow his example, doing as he did in the countries through which we pass?",
  "5228": "Cancel?",
  "5229": "And have you forgiven her for all she has made you suffer?",
  "5230": "Which of us is there can tell how much vanity lurks in our warmest regard for others, and how selfish our love is?",
  "5231": "Has the owner many ships?",
  "5232": "To a distance?",
  "5233": "This house?",
  "5234": "You think it would?",
  "5235": "Are you having a good time?",
  "5236": "Have you heard this?",
  "5237": "Why, where have you been?",
  "5238": "But now who will relieve me of the dread?",
  "5239": "Have the which?",
  "5240": "Is it not obvious?",
  "5241": "Why did you come to tell me yourself, instead of sending my man?",
  "5242": "Holidays?",
  "5243": "I mean did you see the statue fall?",
  "5244": "And she refused you as she says?",
  "5245": "Durbeyfield?",
  "5246": "Can I see the letter?",
  "5247": "In what then, pray, shall I obey you?",
  "5248": "Why should you make a principle out of what you yourselves are, and must be?",
  "5249": "Why should we imagine that the precious metals are likely to do so?",
  "5250": "And what did he answer?",
  "5251": "What IS the matter?",
  "5252": "Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?",
  "5253": "What could he say to her now, after all he had said formerly, when he held her hands as he kissed her hair beside her cheeks?",
  "5254": "No female nurses?",
  "5255": "How did you happen to think of it?",
  "5256": "And what can I do but obey their commands?",
  "5257": "Would it, indeed, have been better if we had loved each other as a boy and a girl, and forgotten it?",
  "5258": "What social and political rights have women?",
  "5259": "And are they arrested?",
  "5260": "Puffs?",
  "5261": "Where do they come from, then?",
  "5262": "Marriage?",
  "5263": "Now, sir, why are you late again, as usual?",
  "5264": "Might anybody ask what their brother has been saying?",
  "5265": "Well, my children, what is going on now?",
  "5266": "What death?",
  "5267": "To what party did he belong?",
  "5268": "Does that suggest nothing to you?",
  "5269": "Where away?",
  "5270": "How did you penetrate hither?",
  "5271": "Caught cold in the grottos, at night, perhaps?",
  "5272": "You are sure?",
  "5273": "Well, and what did the last one say to ye?",
  "5274": "Did you come in the gig?",
  "5275": "And the DISENCHANTMENT of woman is in progress?",
  "5276": "Had your breakfast yet?",
  "5277": "Could he write something original?",
  "5278": "Breakfast?",
  "5279": "Now what does this imply?",
  "5280": "What possessed him to turn listener?",
  "5281": "Is this not a quite unusual politeness?",
  "5282": "Whatever have you done now?",
  "5283": "Are these things nothing?",
  "5284": "Did my sons get power and money?",
  "5285": "If they are such a happy class of people, how was it that you had such a time of punishing and hanging them within the last two years?",
  "5286": "And I have no doubt she loves you like a brother?",
  "5287": "And what have you been thinking about THEM, my busy bee?",
  "5288": "But how will it be?",
  "5289": "Could anything exceed the picture he gives one of scientific ardour?",
  "5290": "There is no exit that way?",
  "5291": "But was he worse?",
  "5292": "Yet how long before it was unsettled again?",
  "5293": "Philanthropy's sake?",
  "5294": "Or are they late because they have had a lovers' meeting?",
  "5295": "Is he very ill?",
  "5296": "Did he know them before?",
  "5297": "Cranly asked softly, happier than you are now, for instance?",
  "5298": "Why, what on earth does she do here?",
  "5299": "What does it matter to me whether the prince is to be what the late king was?",
  "5300": "How can I urge my daughters now to go and raise large families?",
  "5301": "And what did it matter?",
  "5302": "What are you meddling with, stupid?",
  "5303": "Why do you specify the fox?",
  "5304": "Who said that?",
  "5305": "But you have found out something for yourself?",
  "5306": "What is filled with more real existence, and actually has a more real existence, is more really filled than that which is filled with less real existence and is less real?",
  "5307": "Well, what if I could?",
  "5308": "Did you bet?",
  "5309": "Are you not weary of that stupid, meaningless, constantly repeated fraud?",
  "5310": "I say, you're not putting off a party tonight, are you?",
  "5311": "Well, then, what'll we make him the ink out of?",
  "5312": "But, bishop, the question is, who has the power to settle it?",
  "5313": "What does friendship mean if it not so?",
  "5314": "Well, what time for repayment do you wish me to take?",
  "5315": "Whuzzis?",
  "5316": "Why is the hawk so hated by birds?",
  "5317": "About measures, or rhythms, or verses?",
  "5318": "What sort of young woman?",
  "5319": "Do you know where I shall find him?",
  "5320": "I sprung out of bed, and asked, what wreck?",
  "5321": "Are you sure this time?",
  "5322": "Would he have drawn back?",
  "5323": "Why must he go around hunting for some one who is supporting me or has supported me at some time in his life, and who has said something at some time contrary to that platform?",
  "5324": "Had ever a queen such a throne before?",
  "5325": "And what do YOU want?",
  "5326": "Or was he a debtor or a debtor's son?",
  "5327": "Not quite so far, I hope?",
  "5328": "You are not angry with me?",
  "5329": "For what is maintenance?",
  "5330": "What will you?",
  "5331": "What does this mean?",
  "5332": "Go whither?",
  "5333": "Does he not set me at defiance?",
  "5334": "But, after the ball, why had he not returned?",
  "5335": "And where did you hear it?",
  "5336": "What data could he expect from an uncleaned watch?",
  "5337": "But what is all this about?",
  "5338": "And destroy their lives, when they've helped me to remake mine?",
  "5339": "But need we fear anything beyond a momentary anger?",
  "5340": "And which are these two sorts?",
  "5341": "To drink?",
  "5342": "What shall we do, then, to push this great war of freedom and justice to its righteous conclusion?",
  "5343": "Will you get the mail, dear?",
  "5344": "Yes, very noble?",
  "5345": "Do you know where I am leading you?",
  "5346": "Did we notify them of this sage view of ours when we borrowed their money?",
  "5347": "Why did you form a monster so hideous that even YOU turned from me in disgust?",
  "5348": "Atone for a fault by paying money?",
  "5349": "How can you build on such a quicksand?",
  "5350": "The proper determination of these relations rests on the question, to what faculty of cognition they subjectively belong, whether to sensibility or understanding?",
  "5351": "Is that cough of his better?",
  "5352": "Why does he not look at me?",
  "5353": "From what house does the young noble come?",
  "5354": "But now how stands the wind?",
  "5355": "You promise me that frankness?",
  "5356": "And are you building?",
  "5357": "Would his uncle give him a place in the bank?",
  "5358": "Hearken to me, will you?",
  "5359": "What do you think, would they give us anything for it?",
  "5360": "Do you not know?",
  "5361": "How far does one of these little revolvers carry?",
  "5362": "Shall I seal the door?",
  "5363": "What did you take her?",
  "5364": "Yea, and what work, king's daughter?",
  "5365": "You're going to keep open the proposition, so to speak?",
  "5366": "How long will the air in the reservoirs last for us to breathe on board?",
  "5367": "What have you to offer to me, my friend?",
  "5368": "No doubt you felt this yourself?",
  "5369": "Would he take her back to the beach or would he keep her here?",
  "5370": "Coom, wakken oop, will 'ee?",
  "5371": "And that principle which repels the musical, or the just?",
  "5372": "Why had he withheld life from her?",
  "5373": "Is life grievous to you?",
  "5374": "And are we to be carried on far and away into remote distance, and never, never to return?",
  "5375": "Why do you speak so?",
  "5376": "As for what you do me the honor to say, I presume you mean I was afraid?",
  "5377": "So, why not accept these sports as legitimate expressions of a normal and wholesome human nature?",
  "5378": "Whose camp are you in, those who bless or those who curse?",
  "5379": "Is it my mother?",
  "5380": "What is your opinion of it?",
  "5381": "How in the world did you deduce that?",
  "5382": "Now guess what the young one did?",
  "5383": "What money is there to be made here in any other way?",
  "5384": "But suppose she does come there?",
  "5385": "And was this not to be obtained?",
  "5386": "Your reason, your reason for this?",
  "5387": "And silent all?",
  "5388": "What keeps them dancing till five o'clock in the morning through a whole mortal season?",
  "5389": "Why is it not seen that these ideas are mutually repellent, and that, if, by some impossibility, the proletaire could reach a certain degree of intelligence, he would make use of it in the first place to revolutionize society and change all civil and industrial relations?",
  "5390": "What can it be, then?",
  "5391": "Are you aware what you are saying, my lord?",
  "5392": "So much per man?",
  "5393": "What made you go away with him?",
  "5394": "Will all things be set right in the nation?",
  "5395": "Have you informed him of it?",
  "5396": "What is this vessel?",
  "5397": "Devotion which is weary, heroism which has grown old, ambitions which are sated, fortunes which are made, seek, demand, implore, solicit, what?",
  "5398": "Would you venture to so consider them had they been committed by any nation on earth against the humblest of our people?",
  "5399": "He?",
  "5400": "But who had made her tell it?",
  "5401": "To get her out of my bride's way, who might otherwise walk over her rather too emphatically?",
  "5402": "What is the best way of living for us monks?",
  "5403": "Was that the reason why you quitted the service, monsieur le chevalier?",
  "5404": "Where were you meaning to spend the evening?",
  "5405": "Come at last where your duty calls you, eh?",
  "5406": "Who will push a drum hither for me?",
  "5407": "Who has a right to strike her dead?",
  "5408": "Could it be well that she should sacrifice the happiness of two persons to a theoretic love of pure blood?",
  "5409": "But how is it that you know so much of these matters?",
  "5410": "And what is the faculty in man to which imitation is addressed?",
  "5411": "But where do you come from not to know what every coachman in the town knows?",
  "5412": "What is that pain like?",
  "5413": "Drop me in the park, will you?",
  "5414": "When do you wish the carriage to be here?",
  "5415": "Any one dead?",
  "5416": "Have you lost it?",
  "5417": "But if you have a genius for painting, would it not be right to take that as a guide?",
  "5418": "Is that the question?",
  "5419": "A philosopher, perhaps?",
  "5420": "Is it likely?",
  "5421": "May I count upon your assistance?",
  "5422": "Are the eggs nice?",
  "5423": "Of tea with me over the fire?",
  "5424": "And now, my friend, as you cannot come to me, may I come to you?",
  "5425": "Why not today?",
  "5426": "What?",
  "5427": "Will you render me a little help?",

  "5835": "Whose praises can we speak, when we know not what your name may be?",
  "5836": "Am I not understood?",
  "5837": "Are there other rudimental thinking beings than man ?",
  "5838": "How would it do if we had liver and bacon?",
  "5839": "What are you doing with that?",
  "5840": "Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance by lying supinely on our backs and hugging the delusive phantom of hope, until our enemies shall have bound us hand and foot?",
  "5841": "And the lady?",
  "5842": "What'll she be saying to me now?",
  "5843": "Might I ask her age then?",
  "5844": "But what's that to us?",

  "5873": "Should any one go against it?",
  "5874": "What adventure, what tragedy did this souvenir conceal?",
  "5875": "But how could I bear to be a secondary person with her to whom I had been everything, and who could never cease being such to me?",
  "5876": "And if it came to that, would any of them survive the voyage round the formidable promontory?",
  "5877": "But what do you advise, then?",
  "5878": "Nothing to do with me?",
  "5879": "Whose loot is this, if it is not ours?",
  "5880": "But when shall I see him?",
  "5881": "If that be so, do you see what, on the other hand, is involved in it?",
  "5882": "But have you any grave doubts on the subject?",
  "5883": "And for what were our shields intended?",
  "5884": "How much do you suppose he possesses?",
  "5885": "And is it not?",
  "5886": "Is your sword bewitched, or under the influence of some imperial charm?",
  "5887": "Sister must have taken her, or else where can she be?",

  "5937": "What o' devil has he swallowed?",
  "5938": "What good has it done me to mourn for you eternally in the secret recesses of my heart?",
  "5939": "Do you fear he will not understand?",
  "5940": "Why should I bestow all my tediousness upon you, because I have you in my power, and have ink, paper, and time before me?",
  "5941": "But may not there be some occasions, where this may be a little dispensed with?",
  "5942": "My fault, my heart's joy?",
  "5943": "What chance have we now to overtake or even to trace it?",
  "5944": "But who, in sooth, could resist a freshly broiled venison streak eaten out in the open air to the tune of jest and good fellowship?",
  "5945": "Why should one halt on the way?",
  "5946": "Jellyband?",
  "5947": "Have you?",
  "5948": "Is not that a falsehood?",
  "5949": "I suppose you despise me dreadfully, prince, eh?",
  "5950": "What more does the position admit of?",
  "5951": "Expect to get anything by this evidence?",
  "5952": "How would you like to have it?",

  "5977": "As to this case, if you will have scratches, we say that, for anything we know, you may have accounted for them, assuming for the sake of argument that you have not invented them?",
  "5978": "And on this oddness, of which the number three has the impress, the opposite idea will never intrude?",
  "5979": "What now?",
  "5980": "Have you gone mad, my dear friend?",
  "5981": "And, if it has no proper place of its own, like the earth, in the midst of its elements, why does it not fall to the centre of our elements?",

  "6458": "Do you then make nothing at all of her having been so ready to leave us?",
  "6459": "For what do good men who make the best soldiers fight?",
  "6460": "What is your last name again, say you?",
  "6461": "He was not the first that had played away a few trifles, and of what use were birth and fortune if they would not admit some sallies and expenses?",
  "6462": "Would not a peer who, by chance of fortune, might suddenly be driven to herd among the navvies be as afraid of the jeers of his companions, as would any navvy suddenly exalted to a seat among the peers?",

  "6659": "Is that so much that he deserves this praise?",
  "6660": "How did he get there with a child?",
  "6661": "And you reply?",
  "6662": "Do you not admire her?",
  "6663": "Bids she not to be wary?",
  "6664": "Is it not enough to render twin children unwelcome?",
  "6665": "How dare you say he is dishonorable?",
  "6666": "You will take me on board, count, will you not?",
  "6667": "What's he doing here?",
  "6668": "Is there one of my brethren in whom you have equal confidence with myself?",
  "6669": "What's the rent?",
  "6670": "What for, sire?",
  "6671": "And do you mean, by living away from me, living by yourself?",
  "6672": "Does the just man try to gain any advantage over the just?",
  "6673": "Do you hear how they sleep?",
  "6674": "Why should she want another?",
  "6675": "A duplicate?",
  "6676": "What has he done, madame?",
  "6677": "Who's got the key?",
  "6678": "And why, he asked, should the people of your race be colonized, and where?",
  "6679": "Shifts she thus?",
  "6680": "Pay him?",
  "6681": "What flood?",
  "6682": "Is it a man you seen?",
  "6683": "Do you believe that?",
  "6684": "But how does that come about?",
  "6685": "Can we do aught to assist the wretched man?",
  "6686": "Did he say when the battles are to begin?",
  "6687": "How can I find her?",
  "6688": "How do you know?",
  "6689": "What greater luck could he have than to be brought safely home to his father?",
  "6690": "Or is your brain really unhinged?",
  "6691": "And what was then his conduct?",
  "6692": "So you've come, you rascal?",
  "6693": "Is it not truly to ransom prisoners?",
  "6694": "But does that part of the body understand or what?",
  "6695": "Did you mark my words?",
  "6696": "Do you despair now?",
  "6697": "What, I say, is to become of those wretches?",
  "6698": "Do you know that I am growing old?",
  "6699": "How then is it that those people pretend to reject reason?",
  "6700": "Did I say, a few days since, that I had nothing to do with him but to receive my salary at his hands?",
  "6701": "And to what end can it serve either for the service of mankind, or for my own private interest?",
  "6702": "In the few hours that I can possibly allow to elapse before I publish the truth, how is he to be found by us, and only by us?",
  "6703": "Will you have a glass of brandy?",
  "6704": "And fetch him where?",
  "6705": "You know?",
  "6706": "Not crush that accursed race?",
  "6707": "Our conversation yesterday?",
  "6708": "Williams?",
  "6709": "Why did she not wait till the morrow?",
  "6710": "Where did she pick up this companion?",
  "6711": "Then it's NOT postponed?",
  "6712": "Now are you both ready?",
  "6713": "And those hands, pale and inert, lying on the coverlet before him, could they be his own?",
  "6714": "Oh, is he going to take you for a nice drive?",
  "6715": "Surely not let them go unpunished?",
  "6716": "Is that true?",
  "6717": "You know, monseigneur, we set out in search of our comrades?",
  "6718": "Yes, miss?",
  "6719": "If our asteroid has carried with it a portion of the old earth's atmosphere, why should it not likewise retain something of its central fire?",
  "6720": "And this assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice or gesture, is the imitation of the person whose character he assumes?",
  "6721": "Somebody else?",
  "6722": "In the king's service?",
  "6723": "Why, what is important?",
  "6724": "Where are you living?",
  "6725": "But what is straightforward?",
  "6726": "Have you left your liver behind you?",
  "6727": "Was he not holy enough or why could he not catch up on the others?",
  "6728": "Does that mean you'll come?",
  "6729": "Please do this for me, will you?",
  "6730": "What's amiss?",
  "6731": "Was it imbecility or craft?",
  "6732": "Did its orbit correspond with the orbit of the ecliptic?",
  "6733": "The one to the joint venture?",
  "6734": "Again?",
  "6735": "Beautiful?",
  "6736": "How the devil can you expect to digest food, that you neither take the trouble to dissect, nor time to masticate?",
  "6737": "What would you have, my dear fellow?",
  "6738": "What is the process?",
  "6739": "Who could speak to him?",
  "6740": "But who perpetrated that joke, let me ask?",
  "6741": "Is there any difficulty in the way?",
  "6742": "Where will their insolence stop?",
  "6743": "Is this aggression?",
  "6744": "Which of the two will hurl the other over?",
  "6745": "Did she ever talk of revisiting the place?",
  "6746": "You suspect some one?",
  "6747": "What has been decided?",
  "6748": "You shall stay here, do you hear?",
  "6749": "What's become of the boy?",
  "6750": "Where could he?",
  "6751": "Was it even a union in love and goodness?",
  "6752": "And what's six weeks of it?",
  "6753": "Why must you needs go up and change your coat like that?",
  "6754": "What greater misery could heaven inflict?",
  "6755": "I suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers?",
  "6756": "What are the circumstances?",
  "6757": "Am I to wait in the court, sir?",
  "6758": "After you first came to me to get your precious grandson packed off to sea?",
  "6759": "How's this now, kimmer?",
  "6760": "Is there anything the matter?",
  "6761": "A warning for himself?",
  "6762": "To sit?",
  "6763": "What was she being tried for?",
  "6764": "What are those two words, and what is their meaning?",
  "6765": "Do you admire that sort of woman, prince?",
  "6766": "Would this afternoon be inconvenient?",
  "6767": "When are we going to have the marriage?",
  "6768": "Is I ME, or who IS I?",
  "6769": "Does not the boar break cover just when you're lighting a weed?",
  "6770": "And have you had any shooting yet this year?",
  "6771": "Wait a minute, would you mind?",
  "6772": "What evil memory is this?",
  "6773": "For what is bombast but a force of expression too great for the magnitude of the ideas embodied?",
  "6774": "At what hour?",
  "6775": "About how much?",
  "6776": "May we inquire what is this recipe?",
  "6777": "Now, darling, what shall we do?",
  "6778": "You have quite turned his head, and why?",
  "6779": "Has it been proved?",
  "6780": "And do you often go out?",
  "6781": "What will break the enchantment of animation?",
  "6782": "What's that you are saying to me?",
  "6783": "What, are you no longer in possession of your senses?",
  "6784": "With what sang froid artful trains of corruption bring lucrative commissions into particular hands, disregarding the relative situation of different countries, and can much common honesty be expected in the discharge of trusts obtained by fraud?",
  "6785": "Is it a note?",
  "6786": "Now, what sum have you about you?",
  "6787": "Is it your bashfulness, said he, or your obstinacy, that makes you not choose I should read it before you?",
  "6788": "But how, then, could he have known my reply if it had been in the negative?",
  "6789": "Might I ask in which direction you are going?",
  "6790": "But tell me where is he?",
  "6791": "Do the days when you sat at your mother's knee, seem days of very long ago?",
  "6792": "And before hunting them mercilessly, you would not wait until they had committed some fresh act of hostility against us?",
  "6793": "How could things have taken such a violent turn, and so quickly?",
  "6794": "Where does she live?",
  "6795": "What's the strength of the enemy behind that ridge?",
  "6796": "Why stand you distant, nor attempt a deed?",
  "6797": "Are our lackeys sufficiently devoted to us to risk their lives for us?",
  "6798": "Has your majesty nothing else to say to me?",
  "6799": "How do you feed him?",
  "6800": "Because I want to know in which of the three classes you would place justice?",
  "6801": "Had he not gained a great victory, and was it not fit that he should step into his cab with triumph?",
  "6802": "You have news to impart?",
  "6803": "What becomes of the noblest field ever opened for the advancement of our race in religion, in government, in the arts, and in all that dignifies and adorns mankind?",
  "6804": "And wheres the duke?",
  "6805": "But what is the use of asking a jellyfish to sit up straight?",
  "6806": "What does he like then?",
  "6807": "Why is this the goal of life?",
  "6808": "What's the name?",
  "6809": "What could I say?",
  "6810": "If there is any better place for such things, where is it?",
  "6811": "I wonder what we'll do when we get to the moon?",
  "6812": "What do you desire about it?",
  "6813": "How does it feel to be going away?",
  "6814": "Are you afraid of one man?",
  "6815": "You mean that someone waded across the moat?",
  "6816": "But have we any right to assume that things have thus remained from eternity?",
  "6817": "How should we do?",
  "6818": "How do you expect to manage the balloon?",
  "6819": "Who is coming here so early in the morning?",
  "6820": "Why, surely he has not changed his mind about marrying?",
  "6821": "I should like to know upon what occasion?",
  "6822": "Am I falling?",
  "6823": "But what is it, CHERIE?",
  "6824": "What's the use of my getting well?",
  "6825": "What is the use of that?",
  "6826": "He had great confidence in my opinion, and what did I think?",
  "6827": "Joy?",
  "6828": "Do I perceive the man whom I see, when I look into a mirror, to be behind the mirror or in front of it?",
  "6829": "Where's your aunt, miss?",
  "6830": "Then you prefer to go to the temples?",
  "6831": "Is he on his own or is he entirely in with them?",
  "6832": "How many of the elements contained in the object chosen, or so bound up with it that they must be accepted along with it, may fairly be said to fall within the intention of the chooser?",
  "6833": "Why grieve?",
  "6834": "Did you recognize your coachman?",
  "6835": "And this is the little girl you have adopted, I suppose?",
  "6836": "Hear ye?",
  "6837": "What's the next?",
  "6838": "Were you waiting for me?",
  "6839": "This very instant?",
  "6840": "But who can endure to be wedded to a dish?",
  "6841": "Go and where shall I find you?",
  "6842": "Will he return this evening?",
  "6843": "Not when you are with me?",
  "6844": "Is he at home?",
  "6845": "Shall I e'er forget it, mun?",
  "6846": "And that mysterious staircase, the passage through which, not to disturb their sleep, the doctor and nurse pass, or even the father carrying the sleeping child?",
  "6847": "Do you hate it?",
  "6848": "How a wedding present?",
  "6849": "What else?",
  "6850": "And he was alone in achieving an enterprise like that?",
  "6851": "Why has she refused him?",
  "6852": "Why is there an allusion to that cursed 'poor knight' in the anonymous letter?",
  "6853": "And what sort of young lady is she?",
  "6854": "Has a duplicate key been found in his possession?",
  "6855": "How will you travel?",
  "6856": "How many did they say?",
  "6857": "You are not convinced yet?",
  "6858": "Have you provided yourself with money?",
  "6859": "I'm rather on the spot this evening, eh?",
  "6860": "Did she see you?",
  "6861": "Do people die of it?",
  "6862": "I suppose there is nothing to prevent it?",
  "6863": "Did not my neck glitter with diamonds?",
  "6864": "How comes it?",
  "6865": "How otherwise should I have been bad enough?",
  "6866": "You do not reply?",
  "6867": "Then would you call injustice malignity?",
  "6868": "Which will conquer?",
  "6869": "Well, what did the king say?",
  "6870": "Are you sure you're quite so much as six foot three?",
  "6871": "And why, may I ask?",
  "6872": "But we have grain belonging to my brother?",
  "6873": "Is that so, sir?",
  "6874": "What course would then have been left to him?",
  "6875": "Do you hear that baggage?",
  "6876": "Must believe?",
  "6877": "How should I know, my dear?",
  "6878": "Why should its existence be prolonged one hour?",
  "6879": "If the prince knew propriety, who does not know it?",
  "6880": "Now, we ask, what was there in this cave to cause a departure from the ordinary course of nature?",
  "6881": "What's the matter aloft there?",
  "6882": "Should war break out in any of those countries who can foretell the extent to which it may be carried or the desolation which it may spread?",
  "6883": "Quite certain?",
  "6884": "Well?",
  "6885": "And what sort of revenge would you take?",
  "6886": "Is it a time of war?",
  "6887": "I suppose that there has been no answer from my cabman advertisement?",
  "6888": "At this hour who would pass now?",
  "6889": "And what the devil do you wake me for?",
  "6890": "So you've got back?",
  "6891": "Why should he go to a play if he enjoys it so little?",
  "6892": "Was it an angel's voice?",
  "6893": "Why, then, had he come hither?",
  "6894": "What was his version?",
  "6895": "Is it not perfectly clear, that this argument applies with exactly as much force to every combination of human beings for a common purpose, as to governments?",
  "6896": "Yet what good end can all this superficial counsel produce?",
  "6897": "What's the report of this boy?",
  "6898": "Take a glass of wine?",
  "6899": "And what has become of that scoundrel?",
  "6900": "But, what will you do?",
  "6901": "Are you coming down and fight fair?",
  "6902": "But what is the meaning of all this?",
  "6903": "Where be the dogs?",
  "6904": "Well, what have I learned since?",
  "6905": "Would it bore you if I came in for a quarter of an hour?",
  "6906": "But if I disagree with his lordship's views?",
  "6907": "What can they mean?",
  "6908": "He has had punch already, has he not, sir?",
  "6909": "Shall you come down in the world for want of this letter about your son?",
  "6910": "Why, instead of fascinating us with contradictory opinions, did he not reverse experience by causing us to reach the antinomies by the path of analysis of synthetic ideas, instead of leaving us to painfully clamber up the steeps of antinomy to synthesis?",
  "6911": "So, then, you must leave us?",
  "6912": "But at any rate I have shown, have I not, that there is a certain element of improbability about the lady's story?",
  "6913": "And do you use this often?",
  "6914": "Has he got any?",
  "6915": "Are they friendly to us, do you think?",
  "6916": "Me alone?",
  "6917": "And you allow then, sir, that spheres exist, and that these marked and invisible beings mingle amongst us?",
  "6918": "Who knows if they will not manage to restore to me my pension?",
  "6919": "Who would not, when there was the pretext of casting disgrace upon him, confound his whole life and the truths he had espoused, in one heap of obloquy?",
  "6920": "Poodle?",
  "6921": "Is she dead?",
  "6922": "But were you not on horseback?",
  "6923": "Is the countess up yet?",
  "6924": "Then this young man escaped with you?",
  "6925": "Where are my armies, my troops, my treasures?",
  "6926": "Canler?",
  "6927": "Do you belong to the number of the happy or of the miserable?",
  "6928": "Will you promise to be quiet, and not kick up a fuss if I get you something to eat?",
  "6929": "And they not rich?",
  "6930": "In the rouge way?",
  "6931": "She did not resist, for what could she do?",
  "6932": "I shall hear from you?",
  "6933": "What what is, my dear?",
  "6934": "What did you do yesterday afternoon?",
  "6935": "Exploring or what?",
  "6936": "Why was he carried in a cart?",
  "6937": "Why surprised?",
  "6938": "What are you kicking up this row for?",
  "6939": "Yet are you not sorry for fellows of that stamp?",
  "6940": "What if he turns against the others?",
  "6941": "For is not my lord the son of a king?",
  "6942": "Why is it so long?",
  "6943": "Will he even pay me for his lodging?",
  "6944": "A mistake?",
  "6945": "Shall any man hate me?",
  "6946": "Two figures?",
  "6947": "What will dart out presently?",
  "6948": "Does he regret me a little?",
  "6949": "How do you look at the question?",
  "6950": "You remember?",
  "6951": "Then why are there different faiths?",
  "6952": "What be they?",
  "6953": "Have you any further commands for me?",
  "6954": "Is this your pupil?",
  "6955": "And what, pray, WAS the price?",
  "6956": "How is it with you?",
  "6957": "What o'clock is it?",
  "6958": "How could you go to live in a street like that, which is sickly, which is disagreeable, which is ugly, which has a barrier at one end, where one is cold, and into which one cannot enter?",
  "6959": "Surely the writer does not mean that a pleasant or delectable island would not be fit for breeding horses?",
  "6960": "You are a good temper?",
  "6961": "Had the crew seen me disappear?",
  "6962": "Now, do you understand me?",
  "6963": "How many times will I have to speak of this matter?",
  "6964": "On your arm?",
  "6965": "I understand, however, from the inquest that there were some objects which you failed to overlook?",
  "6966": "Where are the graces of my soul?",
  "6967": "Do you know, sir, said she, that her ladyship intends to be down here with you in a few days?",
  "6968": "What is the meaning of this hunt, skipper?",
  "6969": "Why, had you no unicorn's horn, nor bezoar's stone about you, ha?",
  "6970": "What if in this interval the race had lost its manliness and had developed into something inhuman, unsympathetic, and overwhelmingly powerful?",
  "6971": "Had he ever lost his heart so much to something, had he ever loved any person thus, thus blindly, thus sufferingly, thus unsuccessfully, and yet thus happily?",
  "6972": "Did you really think me capable of that?",
  "6973": "How do you like her, my dear?",
  "6974": "Shall I sure?",
  "6975": "Bobby?",
  "6976": "Is she sorry for her shameful conduct?",
  "6977": "Whose portraits are those?",
  "6978": "What was the subject of these singular conversations?",
  "6979": "Is it a check to the action of the individual?",
  "6980": "She is melancholy, then?",
  "6981": "Is is a bargain?",
  "6982": "Would not your excellency like a little refreshment?",
  "6983": "So, then, they have paid my ransom?",
  "6984": "Well, mademoiselle, what are you thinking about, standing there like a statue?",
  "6985": "Will you undertake the task?",
  "6986": "Tell me, will you do this for me, and cease to weep?",
  "6987": "Come, how much?",
  "6988": "Do you know, sir, that you are asking me very strange questions, and that I am very foolish to answer them?",
  "6989": "There is a principle of law and reason in him which bids him resist, as well as a feeling of his misfortune which is forcing him to indulge his sorrow?",
  "6990": "Shall I climb the magnolia?",
  "6991": "What becomes of them?",
  "6992": "Eh, madame, who knows?",
  "6993": "The ghost?",
  "6994": "Gwendolen, will you marry me?",
  "6995": "Will you not rest here?",
  "6996": "What were you thinking of?",
  "6997": "You let my mother alone, will you?",
  "6998": "But what are you going to do?",
  "6999": "What proof may there be that you can do your part in the compact?",
  "7000": "Does he play well?",
  "7001": "Then what?",
  "7002": "Do you mean to say you have had my cigarette case all this time?",
  "7003": "What shall we do then?",
  "7004": "Jean, do you think that I am quite mad?",
  "7005": "Why is not her joy complete?",
  "7006": "Do you know his abode?",
  "7007": "And who was this uncle?",
  "7008": "And will not such things sharpen your souls to revenge?",
  "7009": "Oh, what do you want?",
  "7010": "Who asked after a day or two?",
  "7011": "How could she have been so blind?",
  "7012": "Is this our previous understanding?",
  "7013": "Certainly, why not?",
  "7014": "What orders, your excellency?",
  "7015": "Suppose the worst?",
  "7016": "Then you will not resign, under any circumstances?",
  "7017": "What was the fist?",
  "7018": "My pretty lady, are you come to stay with us?",
  "7019": "What is their object?",
  "7020": "Do I know myself?",
  "7021": "Is he alone?",
  "7022": "And is there not a species of deceit in this to which the honesty of the present age should lend no countenance?",
  "7023": "You who never interest yourself in politics?",
  "7024": "Was it because I wished to give you pain?",
  "7025": "Have WE horns on our heads?",
  "7026": "What on earth do you mean?",
  "7027": "And what about it after all?",
  "7028": "Do you fancy that you can deceive him?",
  "7029": "But, pardon me, have you heard anything of that son?",
  "7030": "Is there any principle in these things?",
  "7031": "A convert to what?",
  "7032": "Who ever did?",
  "7033": "That is an important point, do you understand?",
  "7034": "And what do you mean by your look?",
  "7035": "Guleesh, you clown, you thief, that no good may happen you, why did you play that trick on us?",
  "7036": "Then may I telegraph to the advocate?",
  "7037": "Break off all intercourse with him?",
  "7038": "How do we discover that, in an isosceles triangle, the sides which subtend the equal angles are equal?",
  "7039": "Am I so unlike my countrymen?",
  "7040": "Did you ever know men rise by their own merit under kings?",
  "7041": "And the woman?",
  "7042": "And how do you like being your own mistress?",
  "7043": "But, indeed, what can you expect, monseigneur?",
  "7044": "But can you stay till tomowwow?",
  "7045": "Where shall I meet you?",
  "7046": "You have to confess something?",
  "7047": "And the name of the third?",
  "7048": "Did she say anything more?",
  "7049": "If I am guilty, why am I more fit for a second consulship than I was for my first one?",
  "7050": "Was it not rather because his life was full of bliss that he found strength to live?",
  "7051": "Is it possible that he can have lived at the bottom of the sea?",
  "7052": "If not, why should you come to consult me?",
  "7053": "Lassitude would have come to us, and who knows if I should not even have had the atrocious pain of witnessing your remorse, of sharing it myself, since I should have been its cause?",
  "7054": "Why, where did you leave her?",
  "7055": "How did he hurt himself?",
  "7056": "What shall he be called by us?",
  "7057": "Shall I travel?",
  "7058": "BUT WHAT NEXT?",
  "7059": "You with an old father, and you with pleasant and playful ways?",
  "7060": "Why have your companions deserted you?",
  "7061": "You have promised him that I shall live?",
  "7062": "When shall we two walk together?",
  "7063": "How am I to believe you at present?",
  "7064": "What dress would you like?",
  "7065": "Will you ask me to call it, being for me?",
  "7066": "To whom else could she in such plight look for love?",

  "7475": "Why did he not speak?",
  "7476": "Jarvie?",
  "7477": "I wonder why you ever fell in love with me?",
  "7478": "Tell us then boldly, what we must do for you?",
  "7479": "It will not scratch and claw, but pet and comfort?",
  "7480": "Doth it not strike you as being passing strange that the land is not filled with couriers and proclamations describing my person and making search for me?",
  "7481": "How does she live?",
  "7482": "Who stole my bread?",
  "7483": "Were we to die as he had done?",
  "7484": "Is it then surprising, that when the sole ambition of woman centres in beauty, and interest gives vanity additional force, perpetual rivalships should ensue?",
  "7485": "Then what on earth are they up to?",
  "7486": "Why do I come to you thus?",
  "7487": "You will ask me why I did not dispose of it?",
  "7488": "What have you to say now?",
  "7489": "Do you mean, were we talking about diamonds?",
  "7490": "Shall I carry no message, madame?",
  "7491": "Would any man weary of it, or wish to turn away his eyes?",
  "7492": "What am I to say to him?",
  "7493": "What more can he do?",
  "7494": "But who can be angry at those assiduities which are meant to please him?",
  "7495": "Does that kind go smoothly?",
  "7496": "Does it hurt?",
  "7497": "Where are you, old fellow?",
  "7498": "And have quite forgiven me?",
  "7499": "Did I say a word when he came and took me away, for no earthly reason, from the place where everybody was kind to me?",
  "7500": "How did you know it, then?",
  "7501": "Burning up your awld aunt's rubbidge, I suppose?",
  "7502": "Which room shall we do first?",
  "7503": "Mine?",
  "7504": "You would not make him a cuckold?",
  "7505": "Has he brought back the prisoners?",
  "7506": "For what does reason discover, when it pronounces any action vicious?",
  "7507": "But why should you want to paint me?",
  "7508": "What do you wish?",
  "7509": "Why is the workingman prohibited from charging a like interest for his capital, which is himself?",
  "7510": "Are you ashamed of it?",
  "7511": "But you expected some one then?",
  "7512": "And did he spring clean from the mark or had he to get off with a push?",
  "7513": "You did not see her?",
  "7514": "Tell me what should you say, darling?",
  "7515": "But, in the name of heaven, man, where did you get these extraordinary clothes?",
  "7516": "You say you heard a knocking?",
  "7517": "But what is to be done now?",
  "7518": "But how did you feel when you were loved by a servant?",
  "7519": "Dobbin?",
  "7520": "Will you set them fighting still further, or will you make peace between them?",
  "7521": "Think we're liable to have much trouble?",
  "7522": "You've brought it, have you?",
  "7523": "What think you my friend did?",
  "7524": "And what imports this?",
  "7525": "Biribi?",
  "7526": "What more did I want?",
  "7527": "In the middle of the performance?",
  "7528": "What in the world can be more ridiculous than commercial laws carried out to one's own detriment?",
  "7529": "With THEM?",
  "7530": "And why do we fuss and fume sometimes?",
  "7531": "But why would you return to face again the fierce banth, or whatever other form of destruction they have loosed within that awful trap?",
  "7532": "Do you know what my private and candid opinion is about some of those little jokers?",
  "7533": "What'll he do with it?",
  "7534": "But what next?",
  "7535": "The letter about the mortgage has come, has it?",
  "7536": "You like it so, I suppose?",
  "7537": "A robber maybe?",
  "7538": "And why do you serve?",
  "7539": "Must he see, must he know?",
  "7540": "Do they denote or connote anything?",
  "7541": "Do you, then, really return?",
  "7542": "What a temptin lookin critter you'd be among the galls, would'nt you?",
  "7543": "Think only, what are my children to be?",
  "7544": "You were not content to hear me, eh?",
  "7545": "What have I done that this burden should be laid on me?",
  "7546": "Will you bet?",
  "7547": "What did he give for that picture upstairs which the young man painted?",
  "7548": "Is not our fortune famous, brave, and great?",
  "7549": "Are you so daintily brought up, you cannot eat your own flesh?",
  "7550": "Did you see that one?",
  "7551": "Why shall I not tell the rabbis on you?",
  "7552": "Will you come up?",
  "7553": "How can you show me that you are telling the truth?",
  "7554": "What do you call it?",
  "7555": "Where is your sash, my dear?",
  "7556": "And to whom?",
  "7557": "How long would he be left uneducated?",
  "7558": "Only you here?",
  "7559": "Do you wish me to beg pardon of this creature because she has come here to insult our mother and disgrace the whole household, you low, base wretch?",
  "7560": "And the desire which goes beyond this, or more delicate food, or other luxuries, which might generally be got rid of, if controlled and trained in youth, and is hurtful to the body, and hurtful to the soul in the pursuit of wisdom and virtue, may be rightly called unnecessary?",
  "7561": "Ah, naughty, naughty, would you take a nip at the gentleman?",
  "7562": "What does the presence do?",
  "7563": "Who would not suffer amid perfumed tapestries, cushioned furniture, and liveried servants?",
  "7564": "Well, and how are you?",
  "7565": "Yet who else in all the world was there with the strength and agility to do what this man was now doing?",
  "7566": "Why be uneasy?",
  "7567": "So you are going to sell the place?",
  "7568": "Is he still in a fit?",
  "7569": "But heavens, why?",
  "7570": "What might you be able to do?",
  "7571": "Music?",
  "7572": "There is then more than one who might await you there?",
  "7573": "What's the matter with your tooth?",
  "7574": "Can she have it today?",
  "7575": "Well, who is my benefactor?",
  "7576": "Why so, if you please?",
  "7577": "Where is the man who was here?",
  "7578": "Who again was his closest ally?",
  "7579": "What is your history?",
  "7580": "Is he ill?",
  "7581": "Are you coming tomorrow?",
  "7582": "How now?",
  "7583": "For the best?",
  "7584": "Count 'em?",
  "7585": "And did you convey this answer to your guest?",
  "7586": "By after 'all' you mean after she's in love with somebody else?",
  "7587": "Did you ever see such a den, my dear?",
  "7588": "Yet why are those names disgraceful?",
  "7589": "Not damn the sharper, but the dice?",
  "7590": "And what IS her idea?",
  "7591": "Do you feel inclined to make the monks' acquaintance once more?",
  "7592": "What do you find to attract you in this poor drab little country?",
  "7593": "Are they little, then?",
  "7594": "What are you thinking about, doctor?",
  "7595": "Is it that the poets are deliberately trying to present the conditions of an age anterior to their own?",
  "7596": "What do you want me for, sir?",
  "7597": "Who spoke of such a thing?",
  "7598": "Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?",
  "7599": "What, my rival?",
  "7600": "My little lady, where are you going to?",
  "7601": "What can it mean?",
  "7602": "Would you counsel him to do so?",
  "7603": "Shall I also smite them dead?",
  "7604": "Bah, really?",
  "7605": "You dispute me?",
  "7606": "May I ask what led to this change?",
  "7607": "Why not a fortnight from now?",
  "7608": "What means this shouting in the house?",
  "7609": "And shall disaffection only be rewarded with security?",
  "7610": "Where else will one find a more happy union of magnificence and comfort, where better arrangements to facilitate commerce?",
  "7611": "May I ask why that date?",
  "7612": "Did you get him?",
  "7613": "Is conduct everything?",
  "7614": "You have, then, a repugnance to your profession?",
  "7615": "What could be the matter?",
  "7616": "Where is the doctor?",
  "7617": "Who'll stop me?",
  "7618": "Then will you not forgive me?",
  "7619": "Would you like to speak to him?",
  "7620": "Well, how is he?",
  "7621": "Why not own your own home?",
  "7622": "Was he angry, or pleased?",
  "7623": "But how discover what demands are just?",
  "7624": "Snow?",
  "7625": "How many miles?",
  "7626": "What sort of legislators were they?",
  "7627": "As he was to finish reading there, why not set out at once?",
  "7628": "Does she love me?",
  "7629": "Then, why did you think of giving your daughter to him?",
  "7630": "Are they out beanfeasting?",
  "7631": "Is it not that we may enjoy our liberty?",
  "7632": "Whither else?",
  "7633": "How then shall I take away these opinions?",
  "7634": "You are hurt?",
  "7635": "Any occasion to show my papers?",
  "7636": "What are you laughing at, husband?",
  "7637": "And what could he say to her?",
  "7638": "What does it matter to me?",
  "7639": "But surely you would not wish to offend the bishop?",
  "7640": "Can this be my whole purpose?",
  "7641": "What did she know of this strange creature at her side?",
  "7642": "Pyramids?",
  "7643": "What is ther to do, now?",
  "7644": "How did you begin?",
  "7645": "When I heard her dismiss the footman, I stepped up to him and asked him, what little lady that was?",
  "7646": "You may ask, by what authority do I venture, being a person not concerned in the practice of medicine, to meddle with that subject?",
  "7647": "And what do you wonder?",
  "7648": "So I's to gouge out all their eyes, eh?",
  "7649": "What was it about?",
  "7650": "And the hyperbola?",
  "7651": "And in what city did you live?",
  "7652": "Are you not ashamed to speak to a wretch lying on the stones?",
  "7653": "Can I do anything for you?",
  "7654": "Yet how many people have I hated in my life?",
  "7655": "Will you take a chair?",
  "7656": "And straightway hereupon, arose the natural question of cui bono?",
  "7657": "Could that girl have been playing off any of her coquettish tricks?",
  "7658": "What was I to say?",
  "7659": "Where are you damn'd?",
  "7660": "Do you care to pursue further?",
  "7661": "You take me?",
  "7662": "What could I do but follow him?",
  "7663": "So why was she surprised?",
  "7664": "Will they be here long?",
  "7665": "What means this violence in my house?",
  "7666": "You are quite aware of that?",
  "7667": "There is to be no doubt about that, is there?",
  "7668": "What mean you?",
  "7669": "The first question is, whether a government, proposing to itself the propagation of religious truth as one of its principal ends, is more likely to lead the people right than to lead them wrong?",
  "7670": "And what if they were friends, brethren, countrymen?",
  "7671": "Have we not thieves enow among us already?",
  "7672": "Shall I ring for them to carry you down?",
  "7673": "Is it a blaspheming clause or reserve any way scandalous unto the world?",
  "7674": "And who is this woman?",
  "7675": "What are we to fight about?",
  "7676": "And how then?",
  "7677": "Where's he going to?",

  "7679": "Would you like to go to school?",
  "7680": "What's a ransom?",
  "7681": "Anything wanting to the bonnet?",
  "7682": "Indeed, even apart from an analogy, is it not mighty interesting to narrate, anyway?",
  "7683": "But was I free to claim this liberty?",
  "7684": "Is he hanging somewhere?",
  "7685": "The bear?",
  "7686": "What time is it?",
  "7687": "Straker?",
  "7688": "Oh, he is, is he?",
  "7689": "Do you know the depth of the ocean?",
  "7690": "What can I do for you?",
  "7691": "Do you dare to die?",
  "7692": "Long from home?",
  "7693": "What have you done, indeed?",
  "7694": "Would the gentleman like this room?",
  "7695": "Can I drop you anywhere?",
  "7696": "Was it some midnight assassin who had come to carry out the murderous orders of the secret tribunal?",
  "7697": "But is this all that is known?",
  "7698": "Did you see?",
  "7699": "Now, maiden, before this wedding continues, whom will you have to husband?",
  "7700": "Why that word virtuous, said he, I pray you?",
  "7701": "What was it you did say to the archbishop?",
  "7702": "Is that letter for me?",
  "7703": "To set off to see her again?",
  "7704": "Ought I to be angry with her for being faithful to him?",
  "7705": "And the waiters, yea, and the inns at which they waited, and the cold rounds of beef inside, and the stunted ostler, with his blue nose and clinking pail, where is he, and where is his generation?",
  "7706": "Will not the reasons which indicate the propriety of this arrangement strongly plead for an admission of the other branch of that body to a share of the inquiry?",
  "7707": "Before I close may I say a few words upon two topics, much discussed out of doors, upon which it is highly important that our judgment should be clear, definite, and steadfast?",
  "7708": "What shall I do?",
  "7709": "What would you say, sir squire, to my having such a great natural instinct in judging wines that you have only to let me smell one and I can tell positively its country, its kind, its flavour and soundness, the changes it will undergo, and everything that appertains to a wine?",
  "7710": "Do you know this girl that your friend has made himself a fool about?",
  "7711": "Did you get my hedgehog?",
  "7712": "And what would you do?",
  "7713": "Do you know that he loves YOU, yet?",
  "7714": "Whither so fast?",
  "7715": "Sonya, what is the matter with you?",
  "7716": "Why should he die?",
  "7717": "Are you off?",
  "7718": "How like you him?",
  "7719": "Who, in the situation in which the world has placed me, has a right to require more at my hands?",
  "7720": "Why do you ask with such alarm?",
  "7721": "Where could he hope to find this powerful help?",
  "7722": "Will you come out with me?",
  "7723": "Who did that there?",
  "7724": "What would you that I should reply?",
  "7725": "And are you trying to keep it from me?",
  "7726": "Will you go to the ship in the boat?",
  "7727": "Does that satisfy you?",
  "7728": "The horrible punishment to which you have condemned me for the last six years?",
  "7729": "She had asked him whether the tyrant was soon to pass that way?",
  "7730": "Men in this place?",
  "7731": "To whom did you say?",
  "7732": "To make your will?",
  "7733": "What's the use of making mysteries?",
  "7734": "Do you take a middle course?",
  "7735": "And are you going to run away before you have fairly taught or learned whether they are true or not?",

  "7737": "And pray what IS my position, madame?",
  "7738": "What has he against me?",
  "7739": "What can a fellow do with a fellow like that?",
  "7740": "Attentive?",
  "7741": "Are you in a great hurry?",
  "7742": "But that I feare?",
  "7743": "Corky around?",
  "7744": "Gone?",
  "7745": "Was I convinced of the truth of what I had heard?",
  "7746": "How would the papers talk about it?",
  "7747": "She could pity, or sacrifice herself, or have instincts, but had she ever loved in the noblest way, where man and woman, having lost themselves in sex, desire to lose sex itself in comradeship?",
  "7748": "Now, what theory could justify these perpetual hecatombs?",
  "7749": "A family gathering, is it not, with these old fellows under us here?",
  "7750": "And can therefore neither be ignorance nor knowledge?",
  "7751": "Does the night arise?",
  "7752": "Do you like the position of it?",
  "7753": "May it not have been, that some species of insect upon which they fed had likewise migrated, and that certain noxious animalcules, which had been kept down by this class, had thus multiplied within the atmosphere until their numbers caused disease?",
  "7754": "But why should I not?",
  "7755": "Is it sooth?",
  "7756": "What right have you, monseigneur, to demand an account of my attachments and friendships?",
  "7757": "Can you think that that active brain was at rest during all those weary centuries, whilst her free soul was flitting from world to world amongst the boundless regions of the stars?",
  "7758": "Who the devil's that?",
  "7759": "Good?",
  "7760": "Officers, do you hear?",
  "7761": "Shall I guess?",
  "7762": "What has brought you here?",
  "7763": "Where can all the strength of those medicines go, my dear?",
  "7764": "Did you ever see such a binding?",
  "7765": "And shall we proceed to get rid of the weepings and wailings of famous men?",
  "7766": "Why, have you got into a scrape and want to know how he'll take it?",
  "7767": "Watch in hand?",
  "7768": "How do you find them?",
  "7769": "Are you going to read the paper next?",
  "7770": "Until I die?",
  "7771": "Why do you not work?",
  "7772": "Was there no other cheaper house to seek?",
  "7773": "How is this ?",
  "7774": "If we are drowned, will it not be drowned too?",
  "7775": "Or a fulfiller?",
  "7776": "Did you hear?",
  "7777": "And what are strength and courage?",
  "7778": "You are a brave people and you love bravery, but where was your mighty jeddak during the fighting today?",
  "7779": "Why are the people here?",
  "7780": "Who was the anonymous person, eh?",
  "7781": "Why are you laid up again?",
  "7782": "Single or married?",
  "7783": "What remained for her, but to train her children in her own views and sentiments?",
  "7784": "What brings you here, man?",
  "7785": "Was this a saner point of view than the one she had felt constrained to take when she arrived, through so much agony of renunciation, at her decision?",
  "7786": "But what is the truth?",
  "7787": "You give me the lie and will not draw your sword?",
  "7788": "And where do you live?",
  "7789": "Had she given up to heaven the pure soul of an old maid, the calm soul of a spouse, the tender one of a mother, or one moved by love?",
  "7790": "Can anyone who reads these lines form an idea of the effect this had upon us?",
  "7791": "Why, how came you to be so well acquainted with all this?",
  "7792": "Why should he respect any but himself?",
  "7793": "Will you eat a pudding?",
  "7794": "Will you wake me, before departing?",
  "7795": "What did you tell me?",
  "7796": "But if you have why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures?",
  "7797": "What end would that answer?",
  "7798": "What have you done to me?",
  "7799": "Why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them?",
  "7800": "Laurie, when are you going to your grandfather?",
  "7801": "Is the circumstance strange or novel?",
  "7802": "Do you call this a wedding?",
  "7803": "And it's that you'd call sport, is it, to be abroad in the darkness with yourself alone?",
  "7804": "Who could rescue him from that powerful pressure?",
  "7805": "What happened to her?",
  "7806": "Were the bulls short, with crooked legs?",
  "7807": "Already?",
  "7808": "Will he not also require natural aptitude for his calling?",
  "7809": "And does your ingratitude upbraid me for this?",
  "7810": "And you, you mountebank, what are you laughing at?",
  "7811": "Would she like it?",
  "7812": "Beak's order, eh?",
  "7813": "You suppose that I would ever accept the price of your life?",
  "7814": "What on earth am I going to do?",
  "7815": "What occasion could there be for moonlight in the daytime, and that too whilst the sun shined?",
  "7816": "So it was you, was it?",
  "7817": "And your handwriting?",
  "7818": "Have you any old elms?",
  "7819": "But what would your mamma say?",
  "7820": "In short, how do you know that such a reformation will be a benefit to man?",
  "7821": "New name?",
  "7822": "A comedie?",
  "7823": "Mine honorable freend?",
  "7824": "Surely it's not possible that you've begun to take anything seriously?",
  "7825": "What did he do with the case in his hands?",

  "7830": "What should he choose?",
  "7831": "May I come in?",
  "7832": "Have you quite made up your mind?",
  "7833": "What'll you give?",
  "7834": "Is this truth?",
  "7835": "How do THEY get them?",
  "7836": "How should a repetition of it be treated?",
  "7837": "The count's things?",
  "7838": "And what do they call your friend who is coming this evening?",
  "7839": "But how did the accident happen?",
  "7840": "D'you think the values are all right?",
  "7841": "Are all men like this?",
  "7842": "Is there anything else I can assist you in discovering, besides the villany of your friends?",
  "7843": "What do they come bothering for?",
  "7844": "Is it possible it can be he?",
  "7845": "What have we here?",
  "7846": "You heard nothing yourself last night?",
  "7847": "How much do you think I do?",
  "7848": "Or do they seem to imagine, that to them, as to other men, it must be the purchase either of sweat or of blood?",

  "7857": "Say, shall she go?",
  "7858": "Or was it madness that was creeping upon him and seizing upon his brain, and deceiving him with fantasies so enchanting?",
  "7859": "No epithalamium?",
  "7860": "Was she?",
  "7861": "Yes, and where do you put the others?",
  "7862": "Have you come far?",
  "7863": "Do you hear?",
  "7864": "Is that a reminder, in case you should forget to call?",
  "7865": "Why will you make a crime of that?",
  "7866": "Is what here, child?",
  "7867": "Eh, is she pretty?",
  "7868": "Where was he to draw the line?",
  "7869": "My lords, do you know the news I bring?",

  "9448": "But how did I explain existence?",
  "9449": "We say that we are against arbitrary rule and despotism, and is this not the most awful despotism?",
  "9450": "Has your excellency found our defense so feeble as to believe the measure necessary?",
  "9451": "For why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do?",

  "9977": "You would not inform?",
  "9978": "There is such a person, then?",
  "9979": "Who in this universe?",
  "9980": "Or who would with any patience hear his friends, if they should presume to defend his government as not arbitrary and tyrannical?",
  "9981": "Once more, he said, what ruler is there of the elements of human nature other than the soul, and especially the wise soul?",
  "9982": "Then why not be more careful than him?",

  "9991": "On the contrary, does he not evidently perceive, that from the union of these points there results an object, which is compounded and divisible, and may be distinguished into two parts, of which each preserves its existence distinct and separate, notwithstanding its contiguity to the other?",
  "9992": "What part would they want me to take?",
  "9993": "And has your business been attended to in your absence?",
  "9994": "He's there, is he?",
  "9995": "I may use that freedom with your name?",
  "9996": "Chops, eh?",
  "9997": "But if you saw him so seldom and wrote so seldom, how did he know enough about your affairs to be able to help you, as you say that he has done?",
  "9998": "Postponed for good, I hope?",
  "9999": "His former lackey?",

  "10024": "What is NOT the matter?",
  "10025": "I understand that it was on a professional matter that you wished to speak to me?",
  "10026": "Who says so?",
  "10027": "How about your letters?",
  "10028": "Are you there?",
  "10029": "You mean that you want to get away from me, after I've been to all the trouble and expense of teaching you the business?",
  "10030": "Moreover, what is an obscure corner in such a submersion of joy?",
  "10031": "And who told you?",
  "10032": "What do we know about what she feels?",
  "10033": "Will he know from use whether or no his drawing is correct or beautiful?",
  "10034": "What could the weddineers do?",
  "10035": "I an impostor?",
  "10036": "How do you explain it?",
  "10037": "Why did he not tell them his name?",
  "10038": "Are you deaf?",
  "10039": "Do you think you will be able to guide the bubble?",
  "10040": "Short or tall?",
  "10041": "A mason ?",
  "10042": "What made you get up so early?",
  "10043": "Have you told him that you think him so?",
  "10044": "But I want her to be here within an hour, do you hear?",
  "10045": "How does she look at it, do you think?",
  "10046": "Why are we brought here to answer to such nonsense as this?",
  "10047": "Their names?",
  "10048": "Then you disapprove of duelling?",
  "10049": "Did I give you this?",
  "10050": "Had the boy a bicycle?",
  "10051": "What do you want with it?",
  "10052": "And the maker's name?",
  "10053": "For my father?",
  "10054": "And you are aware too that the latter cannot explain what they mean by knowledge, but are obliged after all to say knowledge of the good?",

  "10058": "What do you say hangs about you?",
  "10059": "Poulter?",
  "10060": "Why were things always mismanaged in her house?",
  "10061": "Is it irrational for the larger group to set such influences to work by holding the lesser group responsible in its collective capacity?",
  "10062": "Will any man try it?",
  "10063": "My den?",
  "10064": "Well, and what more?",
  "10065": "How long are you going to stay?",
  "10066": "But suppose you do not come back?",

  "10069": "Then it's a panel, eh?",
  "10070": "Where else, madame?",
  "10071": "How, I reveal it?",
  "10072": "And be good to her, do you hear?",
  "10073": "Must this melancholy parallelism be yet more completely verified?",
  "10074": "Monotonous?",
  "10075": "But who has handsomer, better children than ours?",
  "10076": "Is it not a beautiful name?",
  "10077": "In what way can I have been made a prisoner?",
  "10078": "Did I say that?",
  "10079": "What were YOU expecting we'd found?",

  "10093": "Then they had your orders for what they do?",
  "10094": "That gentleman, sir?",
  "10095": "Could we not both speak at the same time?",
  "10096": "What tale are you telling me?",

  "10103": "Suppose they do take up a case what does it amount to?",
  "10104": "Why, in naming the most amiable, cannot I recall them and myself also to that happy age in which our moments, pleasing as innocent, were passed with such happiness together?",
  "10105": "May I see to it?",
  "10106": "Then where you are is, of all places, the one he will avoid?",
  "10107": "Who is at the door, other than he?",
  "10108": "Are you sleepy?",
  "10109": "AGUARAS?",
  "10110": "What inn?",
  "10111": "You have been back a month, have you not?",

  "10170": "Then do they not love each other now?",
  "10171": "Shall I open it?",
  "10172": "Which dress am I to get ready?",
  "10173": "It would be an impertinence elsewhere, but it is not so here, to ask your name and condition?",
  "10174": "Does she go far?",
  "10175": "Why not choose one among the many paths to distinction which untried life held out so temptingly, and take his chance of success as others had done before him?",
  "10176": "Besides, are we ever obliged?",
  "10177": "Why are you always puttering?",
  "10178": "What is the character of the addresses?",
  "10179": "That, then, is your opinion?",

  "10182": "Are you going to be my servant?",
  "10183": "What other name does she go by?",
  "10184": "What is its duty?",
  "10185": "But, peradventure, it may be sagaciously urged, how is this?",
  "10186": "And yet how many might I not have been guilty of?",
  "10187": "Do not I tell you she will be your sister?",
  "10188": "So he was not there?",
  "10189": "What are you thinking of, eh?",
  "10190": "However, did I find you out?",
  "10191": "Whither now would they goad him?",
  "10192": "But is the thing settled between you or not?",
  "10193": "So it does not please you to work?",
  "10194": "Your savings?",
  "10195": "If you do not return, how does it concern you?",
  "10196": "How much is a plate of peas?",
  "10197": "Would you like to come for a walk?",
  "10198": "Before?",
  "10199": "Would you not try to save her from suffering more even ifor would you?",
  "10200": "Why spoil such pleasant relations?",
  "10201": "Straker was brought back here, I presume?",
  "10202": "The only ones?",
  "10203": "Would he never get a good job?",
  "10204": "I fire first?",
  "10205": "Who has called?",
  "10206": "But why were they to suffer for what fellows in the higher line did?",
  "10207": "But why is my grandfather allowed to live?",
  "10208": "How was it that two guns were abandoned in the center?",
  "10209": "And how is it possible for me to do so?",
  "10210": "Did a minute suffice for all this?",
  "10211": "And of what room was it the key?",
  "10212": "And whose was the sixteenth?",
  "10213": "How can YOU be dull at a ball?",
  "10214": "Could I, tell me, do with such weak instruments the great things I meditate?",
  "10215": "My dear friend, will you shake me up a little?",
  "10216": "Is a bill of rights essential to liberty?",

  "10578": "Look?",
  "10579": "Is he asleep?",
  "10580": "And if each is one, and both are two, she will conceive the two as in a state of division, for if there were undivided they could only be conceived of as one?",
  "10581": "What could they do, did she think?",
  "10582": "Can I help you now?",
  "10583": "How do they live?",
  "10584": "This beast, I rather conclude, friend, is not of home raising, but is from foreign lands, or perhaps from the little island itself over the blue water?",
  "10585": "Do they hop?",
  "10586": "What's wrong with me?",
  "10587": "Would it not then have been the same if he had died of a fever or of the small pox, of old age, or of anything else?",
  "10588": "In order not to involve the social wealth in an unlimited and consequently disastrous solidarity, will they content themselves with imposing rules upon the spirit of invention and enterprise?",
  "10589": "Is not that a perfect and lofty love?",
  "10590": "But was she here when the lady came?",

  "10601": "Would you be good enough to turn your face to the window?",
  "10602": "And why had I these aspirations and these regrets?",
  "10603": "So you have a lodging?",
  "10604": "Go away with you?",
  "10605": "This is not your writing?",
  "10606": "For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?",
  "10607": "Who told me to love her?",
  "10608": "And is that all you can say for him?",
  "10609": "Do you think it would be worth a week's wages?",
  "10610": "When is the time?",
  "10611": "What is this, my dear?",
  "10612": "What if I were to try such and such a thing?",
  "10613": "Do you think the countess would mind my having or two of them here if I were to ask her?",
  "10614": "How can she conceal the intrigue from other people's eyes?",
  "10615": "And the persons whose property is taken from them are compelled to defend themselves before the people as they best can?",
  "10616": "Do they, when they put to flight, as it is said, disorders that have baffled the powers of medicine, work in conformity to the light of reason?",
  "10617": "Have you the keys to those two doors?",
  "10618": "You understand that, I hope?",

  "10622": "Can they be saved when the army has gone?",
  "10623": "Can it harm my lover for me to live on after he is dead, if I take no pleasure in anything but in the woe I bear for him?",
  "10624": "Will you only say that you have been mistaken, and that I may depend on your not acting secretly in future?",
  "10625": "Was it for this, however, that his visits to the farm formed a delightful exception to the meagre occupations of his life?",
  "10626": "An instance?",
  "10627": "But will you go with me to gain the pardons?",
  "10628": "Will you stand upon your legs, you young devil?",
  "10629": "Did she object to it?",
  "10630": "And if her ships are not to be admitted into our harbours, I would ask, how is she to protect us?",
  "10631": "May I hope it?",
  "10632": "Must you really go now?",
  "10633": "And the more detestable his actions are to the citizens the more satellites and the greater devotion in them will he require?",
  "10634": "I suppose it could be managed somehow?",
  "10635": "Have you made him any promise that I must ratify?",
  "10636": "Am I not interrupting your conversation?",
  "10637": "Have you no fears lest your conduct should be misinterpreted?",
  "10638": "The big cake or the little deadlies?",
  "10639": "Will you swear to sacrifice even your lives in their defense, and to keep them always by your valor in the path to victory?",
  "10640": "Anything moving in the old place, mid I ask?",
  "10641": "Are you going to leave me?",
  "10642": "Surely you are mistaken about his trade?",
  "10643": "Can this be it?",
  "10644": "Lemonade, sir?",
  "10645": "Have I not shown my power?",
  "10646": "And how can she do so if, up to this minute, by your own statement, she is herself in ignorance of your knowledge?",
  "10647": "What do we know of the beauty they replace?",
  "10648": "Am I still superintendent?",
  "10649": "Why, what is there so terrific in the cavern?",
  "10650": "Then where did papa get it?",
  "10651": "Then, it is your opinion that our friend has perished in the waves?",
  "10652": "Do you really forgive me?",
  "10653": "What do I say?",
  "10654": "Did I frighten you so much?",
  "10655": "Are you here before me?",
  "10656": "But ought we to attempt to construct one?",
  "10657": "And she knows nothing of it?",
  "10658": "Have you seen a ooser?",
  "10659": "How do you know that?",
  "10660": "What, are you ready there?",
  "10661": "What do you want with her, boy?",
  "10662": "You know the hunt and chase?",
  "10663": "You at last?",
  "10664": "On your word, now?",
  "10665": "But, it will be asked, what kind of a treasure is this that we propose to bequeath to posterity?",
  "10666": "How do you get at that?",
  "10667": "Frank?",
  "10668": "Are you strong enough?",
  "10669": "Now, I want to hear you swear that you are not married to that woman?",
  "10670": "But what, then, is the noise?",
  "10671": "How did you conceive that idea?",
  "10672": "Now, do it look like it?",
  "10673": "Where can they be?",
  "10674": "Was he considering what pallet, what brushes, what canvas he must use, to introduce them into visible life through his art?",
  "10675": "Can you spare me a very few minutes?",
  "10676": "Has the sly old fox made his fortune then, and gone to live in a tranquil cot in a pleasant spot with a distant view of the changing sea?",
  "10677": "What man would marry a girl so placed?",
  "10678": "To what end?",
  "10679": "Do you know?",
  "10680": "Or is it by the law courts and the judge?",
  "10681": "Whom had we to deal with?",
  "10682": "And yet there was one thing wanting in order to complete your happiness?",
  "10683": "I hope there's nothing wrong?",
  "10684": "Have the private emotions also their gutter press?",
  "10685": "Yes, but how came you here again?",
  "10686": "Do you think there is a single person in the county who will not know that his doing is a sign that he has quarrelled with me?",
  "10687": "Are your doubts on that point too strong?",
  "10688": "Who you gwine to take to jail now?",
  "10689": "You, my lord?",
  "10690": "But who could help loving her?",
  "10691": "How so, if he love her?",
  "10692": "Was there anything unusual about the bodies?",
  "10693": "Would you be so good as tell us?",
  "10694": "Now, is it possible to reconstruct the series from which money seems to have been detached, and, consequently, restore the latter to its true principle?",
  "10695": "Have you been studying much law lately?",
  "10696": "You told her that?",
  "10697": "And is it your cook who prepares these pills?",
  "10698": "What infatuation is it, what obstinate prepossession, that blinds you to that?",
  "10699": "Or do I have to hit you again?",
  "10700": "Suppose he should become blind, or, at all events, never recover sufficient strength of sight to engage in an occupation which would be congenial to her feelings, and conduce to her removal from this lonely dwelling among the hills?",

  "10707": "Are you still sure to close up?",
  "10708": "You'll know our light porter again?",
  "10709": "Is it a good road?",
  "10710": "Am I to let the troops have the oats, and to take a receipt for them?",
  "10711": "Had he in his turn succumbed?",
  "10712": "Anna, what is it for, why will you?",
  "10713": "Philanthropic?",
  "10714": "You remember what people say when they are sick?",
  "10715": "Do you often have this housewarming?",
  "10716": "There are forty years of work in me yet, and why should you despair?",
  "10717": "A tree?",

  "10719": "Would you like some nice little part with the infant?",
  "10720": "And is it not needed whenever it helps us and hurts the enemy?",
  "10721": "If you put a question to a person in a right way, he will give a true answer of himself, but how could he do this unless there were knowledge and right reason already in him?",
  "10722": "Was he here this morning?",
  "10723": "Have you posts of profitable pecuniary emolument?",
  "10724": "How could such a state of things be kept secret?",
  "10725": "And do you still deem it a part of valor to die?",
  "10726": "But not about all?",

  "13556": "What at?",
  "13557": "Something that you would like done, is it not?",
  "13558": "Was that all?",
  "13559": "Will you not let me look at it also?",

  "13626": "Do you think he had planned this robbery, when he went with you to the lodging?",
  "13627": "O, is your bundle ready?",
  "13628": "It was a cunning device, for, apart from the chance of driving your victim to his death, what peasant would venture to inquire too closely into such a creature should he get sight of it, as many have done, upon the moor?",

  "13638": "But where will we be tomorrow?",
  "13639": "What advice?",
  "13640": "Who told her?",
  "13641": "Remarkable for what?",
  "13642": "Is it not what happens to every one?",
  "13643": "But how is it she does not think of it herself?",
  "13644": "Who may it be for?",
  "13645": "What makes you weep, mama?",
  "13646": "Where is his office?",
  "13647": "What do you mean by that question?",
  "13648": "If this is the great evil of being alone, then what is good and what is evil?",
  "13649": "Have you any arms?",

  "13662": "Will you take up our ivory and return in peace to our village, or shall we follow along your trail toward the north as we have followed for the past three days?",
  "13663": "How can there be any secrecy, when everything is known to all of us?",
  "13664": "Why did he so?",
  "13665": "What was it, my own mother?",
  "13666": "But when you held her in your power, why did you not drown her, strangle her, hang her?",
  "13667": "But by whom will Z be paid for the loss caused him by the profit charged by A in the beginning?",
  "13668": "Do you think I'd let him imagine for a minute that anything he said could influence me in my public duty?",
  "13669": "Is she safe?",

  "13684": "What is the result at present?",
  "13685": "Well, said he, who next?",
  "13686": "But what if he were mistaken in his views, and there were no necessity that his own absolute separation from her should be involved in the incident of her marriage?",
  "13687": "Is it suppression?",
  "13688": "Then they will quarrel as those who intend some day to be reconciled?",
  "13689": "Where is the pain?",
  "13690": "Why did you take the axe along?",
  "13691": "How was it done?",
  "13692": "And why are you all alone?",
  "13693": "The scene which followed, who can describe?",
  "13694": "Where does he expect me to get it?",
  "13695": "Did you call, sir?",
  "13696": "Where, then, is your enthusiasm?",
  "13697": "Do you wish it?",

  "14015": "Then, why in the world do you pretend not to be willing to come?",
  "14016": "Is it by permission that he remains there?",
  "14017": "Will you tell him also why I drove you out?",
  "14018": "Are you going to lead me to liberty?",

  "14028": "Would she please you as a wife?",
  "14029": "How should you have liked making sermons?",
  "14030": "Why did she pity me?",
  "14031": "One of your boarders?",
  "14032": "If so, how?",
  "14033": "Is there anything new in the wind?",
  "14034": "Is not this marvellous?",
  "14035": "Whatever the motive, you want the best?",

  "14051": "Why are you hindering us?",
  "14052": "Crupp?",
  "14053": "Would you like some breakfast?",
  "14054": "You will not be afraid?",

  "14057": "Yes, and what of that?",
  "14058": "What boy, friend?",
  "14059": "Does he travel in state?",
  "14060": "Your vision of you and me together?",
  "14061": "Do you think so, sir?",

  "14080": "Why, dear child, what has made your poor little heart so sad?",
  "14081": "You mean she'll make it out her own fault?",
  "14082": "Is there anything else?",
  "14083": "And if she had been dissolved into earth, or worse, what would you have dreamt of then?",
  "14084": "He who had in former days known all the roads to triumph, and who, from the summit of his chariot of lightning, pointed them out with a sovereign finger, had he now reached that state of sinister amazement when he could lead his tumultuous legions harnessed to it, to the precipice?",
  "14085": "Has he got wind of some host approaching, and does he wish to warn us, or would he speak upon some other matter of public moment?",
  "14086": "If we're lads, what does he call himself?",
  "14087": "Why threepence?",
  "14088": "But do you care about them?",
  "14089": "I now know you are all right, and what can I wish for more?",
  "14090": "But if this indemnity is refused me, what do I, a proletaire, care for the tranquillity and security of the rich?",
  "14091": "Why may not our country at some time average as many?",
  "14092": "Does it hurt?",
  "14093": "And what, after all, is the security which this training gives to governments?",
  "14094": "Now what are you going to do?",
  "14095": "How was what done?",
  "14096": "Do you know it?",
  "14097": "Now was she to begin?",
  "14098": "And understand them?",
  "14099": "What could her heart want more, better, more beautiful, more rich than such a love as this?",
  "14100": "Now how did this odious stigma originate?",
  "14101": "And who will weigh it for you?",
  "14102": "Does any one know?",
  "14103": "What settlement is he to make?",
  "14104": "How could I be that?",
  "14105": "You know my studio at the top of the house?",
  "14106": "How far might you call yourselves from the marshes, hereabouts?",
  "14107": "He being the heir?",
  "14108": "Thomas, you have returned, then, and your first act is again an indiscretion and a piece of foolhardy rashness?",
  "14109": "What caused it?",
  "14110": "How then could I unite with this wild idolator in worshipping his piece of wood?",
  "14111": "Have not some of the intriguers put it into his head that I regard him with jealousy?",
  "14112": "I hope he's not vicious?",
  "14113": "In his glance?",
  "14114": "Who will go and cut wood in the forest?",
  "14115": "What, has he purchased arms, then?",
  "14116": "Now, what is the value of this product?",
  "14117": "Will you?",
  "14118": "Because we are bidden to feast with them, because we are bidden to rejoice with them, because we are bidden to play the lute with them, because we are bidden to dance with them?",
  "14119": "Yes, well?",
  "14120": "And why did you refuse, my son?",
  "14121": "Is that what they think of relationships nowadays?",
  "14122": "Why did I do that?",
  "14123": "Then you have some other motive unknown to us?",
  "14124": "Old?",
  "14125": "Then you would infer that opinion is intermediate?",
  "14126": "What other course was left to take?",
  "14127": "If the dream is not the same as the things dreamed, in what other form does it appear to you?",
  "14128": "Do you not know it?",
  "14129": "But have you not received my notes?",
  "14130": "Are the preparations for the games complete?",
  "14131": "Where do you wish me to go, madame?",
  "14132": "And who may this be?",
  "14133": "What if she's marrying me simply to be married?",
  "14134": "Which way?",
  "14135": "What about them?",
  "14136": "Would you like to know the opinion of a chronicler of the fourteenth century?",
  "14137": "Well, is he?",
  "14138": "What shall we do?",
  "14139": "Should he abandon his friends who were expecting him?",
  "14140": "Clever?",
  "14141": "And when's the wedding to be?",
  "14142": "What is all that about?",
  "14143": "For of what other common political community will any one say that the whole human race are members?",
  "14144": "When we had walked about a mile by moonlight, we perceived a horseman behind us, who coming up, wished us good even, and asked which way we went?",
  "14145": "Now, then, what did you do to your hair?",
  "14146": "Why do you pish, captain?",
  "14147": "And what would be the use of behaving otherwise?",
  "14148": "Cousin, will you any tobacco?",
  "14149": "Why not think much about this mansion?",
  "14150": "Is it his child?",
  "14151": "How do you say it?",
  "14152": "Who's been telling you that?",
  "14153": "How like you this?",
  "14154": "Have you got a pistol?",
  "14155": "Then the cowardly and mean nature has no part in true philosophy?",
  "14156": "That you believe there's nothing I'm afraid of?",
  "14157": "Now are you content?",
  "14158": "Three what?",
  "14159": "What is there in heaven or on earth which it does not embrace, and with so much facility, with so much gracefulness, as if there were scarcely an effort in it, or as if self was charmed away, and might not mingle to distract it?",
  "14160": "Is it really only negative?",
  "14161": "HIS father?",
  "14162": "Of what sort could a woman be who wrote such a letter as that?",
  "14163": "You acknowledge that as your conviction on the subject?",
  "14164": "And why should I?",
  "14165": "And is it just to assail, condemn, or despise them for doing so?",
  "14166": "Could her mother own it if she did?",
  "14167": "Now, can you?",
  "14168": "Well, what is there so astonishing in that?",
  "14169": "What, will he deal upon such quantities of wine, alone?",
  "14170": "Why, it may be asked, have all the most eminent living naturalists and geologists rejected this view of the mutability of species?",
  "14171": "Besides, what's the good of criticism?",
  "14172": "Do you think a woman could go alone at that hour to a bachelor's house?",
  "14173": "A very unpleasant line of character, I should think?",
  "14174": "Should I find down there a whole colony of exiles who, weary of the miseries of this earth, had sought and found independence in the deep ocean?",
  "14175": "I presume we are going to pass the night here?",
  "14176": "Do you know that seventeen bottles of rye whiskey were sent out from the town this afternoon to that innocent and unsuspecting school house?",
  "14177": "Is it death?",
  "14178": "Why, indeed, am I still here?",

  "14180": "From what part of the world did it rise?",
  "14181": "Do you wish to see him?",
  "14182": "Is not your father living?",
  "14183": "Well, you do not reply?",

  "14227": "Where shall I ever find a friend, when these three are my enemies, belonging to me, yet putting me to death?",
  "14228": "Besides, what is danger in comparison with the right?",
  "14229": "How is it, then, I repeat, that a wholly external accident has changed the nature of man, which is supposed to be good and gentle and social?",
  "14230": "Surely not, and why is it that they are not willing, as they formerly were willing, to sacrifice the interests of their country to the interests of their religious persuasion?",
  "14231": "Then when am I to have it?",
  "14232": "I may sacrifice my soul, but what matters it?",
  "14233": "Did SHE make 'em, now?",

  "14502": "Say he need not lose his children and his wife, will he love you for that more than one who knows he well deserved the loss?",
  "14503": "Or had it transformed itself into this man, and what did the whole thing mean?",
  "14504": "Do you know anything of the commissionnaire?",
  "14505": "Through marriage?",
  "14506": "And do you impute it to either of those?",

  "15636": "You are going away tomorrow?",
  "15637": "How are you all?",
  "15638": "And what brings you here, you jade?",
  "15639": "Could you pull a little stronger?",
  "15640": "About the dean?",
  "15641": "Do you think you've 'known' me?",
  "15642": "May I ask your name?",
  "15643": "But what's the use?",
  "15644": "Think I was going to stop on now I'm a gentleman of property?",
  "15645": "Why had she come out?",
  "15646": "For who would want to choose by rule?",
  "15647": "What do you say?",
  "15648": "After all, I'm not the first one to have a baby, am I?",
  "15649": "Not yet?",
  "15650": "Have you finished your repast, friend?",
  "15651": "But can we ever be in love with the former?",
  "15652": "Is it not strange compensation?",
  "15653": "Where did he go?",
  "15654": "For camping?",
  "15655": "Hall?",
  "15656": "Do you know what the result of that would be?",
  "15657": "Pray, what virtue do you attribute to a letter, which your speech might not possess?",
  "15658": "Can we fly, my friends?",
  "15659": "What should they fear?",
  "15660": "Was he about to learn at last who it was that he loved, who that young girl was?",
  "15661": "Some unique chaplet?",
  "15662": "Who is it that speaks?",
  "15663": "And where are you going?",
  "15664": "The one loves and embraces the subjects of knowledge, the other those of opinion?",
  "15665": "How can that ever be, father?",
  "15666": "Are you mad?",
  "15667": "Would there be any objection to my taking leave of any one I know, about here, before I go away?",
  "15668": "Why, where was you raised?",
  "15669": "Soon, sir?",
  "15670": "Had he hidden some of his magic tools underneath the floor?",
  "15671": "So late, is it?",
  "15672": "Would not the people start up in their seats, by a simultaneous impulse, and tear him down out of the pulpit which he defiled?",
  "15673": "Have you tried to drive a harpoon through a body?",
  "15674": "Did I perhaps learn from it the long clear silence?",
  "15675": "Have men, collectively, no whims, no prejudices?",
  "15676": "What did you pay for that meat?",
  "15677": "Or was it sensible?",
  "15678": "Well, what can I do for you this morning?",
  "15679": "You have money for them, for those loafers?",
  "15680": "Among those which grow lean which is that which grows leanest?",
  "15681": "Who's that grunting?",
  "15682": "What could we care about in the whole world beside, if we belonged to each other?",
  "15683": "To be in love is folly?",
  "15684": "Discarding punctilio and maxims adapted to more manageable times, and looking only to the unprecedentedly stern facts of our case, can you do better in any possible event?",

  "15692": "Please, uncle, may I go on the river, then, if I'm not to go into the street?",
  "15693": "You probably know what I am going to tell you, or do you not?",
  "15694": "What do you mean by that?",
  "15695": "And you, monsieur, you were to obtain conditions for us, I think?",
  "15696": "Could you give me something to do for a few days?",
  "15697": "You like that style?",
  "15698": "D'you believe me?",
  "15699": "It was a troubled dream?",
  "15700": "Pain?",

  "15719": "Which of them will nationalize the other?",
  "15720": "Your reverence, whither away so quickly?",
  "15721": "If so, where is it?",
  "15722": "Have they heard anything against her?",
  "15723": "Is she very clever?",

  "15735": "Have we not here a picture of his way of life?",
  "15736": "What is it made of?",
  "15737": "Did you strike golden guineas out of solder, young fellow, or shilling coins itself?",
  "15738": "How shall we get down?",
  "15739": "Does it take long to get a nose, now?",
  "15740": "Otherwise, what would become of society?",
  "15741": "Surely now they would find a document which would throw some light upon all the mysteries that had happened?",
  "15742": "To listen, say I?",
  "15743": "You say yes?",
  "15744": "Pray tell me how it happened?",
  "15745": "Now the question is, after what manner this utility and importance operate upon us?",
  "15746": "What makes you a coward?",
  "15747": "But, do you know?",
  "15748": "Can you dispute the boundary?",
  "15749": "And now tell me, I conjure you, has not imitation been shown by us to be concerned with that which is thrice removed from the truth?",
  "15750": "But what use can I make of it, if it lies in your cabinet?",
  "15751": "Are you going to try to go around it, and land on the side turned away from us?",
  "15752": "And pray what am I charged with?",
  "15753": "What matter?",
  "15754": "What would you do, tell me, if your sister listened to such a proposition?",
  "15755": "How is this to be accounted for?",

  "15762": "Who is it, I said, whom you are refusing to let off?",
  "15763": "But tell me how is my mother?",
  "15764": "You do not admit the conceivability at all?",
  "15765": "Is it only a piatak that I am worth?",
  "15766": "But who lighted it?",
  "15767": "Had you never noticed them before?",
  "15768": "How will we mark that passage?",
  "15769": "Do you not comprehend?",
  "15770": "You knew, then?",
  "15771": "Yes, sir?",
  "15772": "And what is your theory of this poor fellow's death?",

  "15793": "Are you glad to go?",
  "15794": "Who, then, can calculate the course of a molecule?",
  "15795": "What does it mean?",
  "15796": "When shall you send your invitations?",

  "15798": "Where does that wedding come from?",
  "15799": "Has he at last concluded?",
  "15800": "To what young lady?",
  "15801": "How could he be otherwise?",
  "15802": "But which one?",

  "15809": "Have you seen anything of them?",
  "15810": "And you approve of such a union?",
  "15811": "Did you look at these papers on the table?",
  "15812": "After the performance?",
  "15813": "Is it fear or is it anger now?",

  "16594": "You do not love me, then?",
  "16595": "Where have you come from, my dear count?",
  "16596": "Why then, as I perused them, did the hairs of my head erect themselves on end, and the blood of my body become congealed within my veins?",
  "16597": "And will you not so much honour me and so help me as to read it for me?",
  "16598": "And I shall not see her before you start?",
  "16599": "Or is his gravity only in appearance?",
  "16600": "How can that be done?",
  "16601": "How can we keep company with you?",
  "16602": "Oliver, what's the news?",
  "16603": "Are you?",
  "16604": "If we come soon can you go a piece wid us?",
  "16605": "What rank did he hold on board?",
  "16606": "Do I show it?",
  "16607": "What will but felt the fleshly screen?",
  "16608": "If a superior man abandon virtue, how can he fulfil the requirements of that name?",
  "16609": "Hopes hovering in the near future as well as sorrows born of the past?",
  "16610": "But what ails you, father?",
  "16611": "Where are you going, wife?",
  "16612": "On business?",
  "16613": "Do you smell this little marsh?",
  "16614": "And reasoning is peculiarly his instrument?",
  "16615": "How the devil is one to get the intention of the soul except by painting exactly what one sees?",
  "16616": "None of my knaves there?",
  "16617": "Have you been waiting long?",
  "16618": "Or evil expectations?",
  "16619": "By the way, papa, where do you make the explosives?",
  "16620": "But who is this that breaks upon me?",
  "16621": "Why do you shout so?",
  "16622": "What must I promise?",
  "16623": "And you have accepted him?",
  "16624": "And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?",
  "16625": "Do you mean the bo'sun?",
  "16626": "To its address, my lord?",
  "16627": "What made you think it was she?",
  "16628": "What shall I say, madam?",
  "16629": "I believe I've only had the honour of seeing you once myself?",
  "16630": "I told him, and he was attentive until I had finished, and then burst out laughing again, and asked me if I was sore afterwards?",
  "16631": "Has the proud young lady gone?",
  "16632": "And did you also discover a bitter taste?",
  "16633": "Should he find that place in this city if he could get there?",
  "16634": "Must I give up my place to your eminence, or shall I continue?",
  "16635": "Shall I be fatal to your happiness?",
  "16636": "Then why not come to it?",
  "16637": "Who in the dance so fleet?",
  "16638": "What are you reading now?",
  "16639": "You saw the captain?",
  "16640": "What say you to that?",
  "16641": "If the question is put, why do men desire to deposit their life outside their bodies?",
  "16642": "Well, but shall we not meet again?",
  "16643": "When you said that, did you mean that it seemed to you to be louder than the second one?",
  "16644": "We are almost drowned here amongst these lettuce, shall we speak?",
  "16645": "But it is long ago?",
  "16646": "How can I explain that infatuation?",
  "16647": "Well, what did he say about me?",
  "16648": "Are they boys?",
  "16649": "Do you affirm that?",
  "16650": "And who is to pursue him?",
  "16651": "May we not then conjecture that these rules are in fact the very safeguards which we should expect to find adopted for the protection of the king's life?",
  "16652": "Are you really sad?",
  "16653": "And where are your sisters?",
  "16654": "Well, what have you got to say to me?",
  "16655": "Has there been any inconsistency on his side to create alarm?",
  "16656": "How does it differ from soul?",
  "16657": "And what effect did this discourse produce?",
  "16658": "Rather a good marriage this, I believe?",
  "16659": "Which way is not despair?",
  "16660": "And what brings you up here under somebody else's name?",
  "16661": "May it not be that the utopists find it easier to expatiate upon these grand words than to seriously study social manifestations?",
  "16662": "Are you looking for anything?",
  "16663": "Did she perform any ceremony befitting it, or what did she do?",
  "16664": "Let me see, what harvest shall we have?",
  "16665": "To us forever are the gates of heaven shut, for who shall open them to us again?",
  "16666": "And now what is to be done?",
  "16667": "You say that she must have come back this way?",
  "16668": "There, NOW do you understand?",
  "16669": "What is the matter with you, you fool?",
  "16670": "Could he trust himself to come down to breakfast a free man in the morning?",
  "16671": "Could she make that sacrifice?",
  "16672": "Now, what in the world ailed the creature?",
  "16673": "Will they never bring that emetic?",
  "16674": "What have we to do?",
  "16675": "He did not marry this accomplished young lady?",
  "16676": "Who says man and wife are bad company?",
  "16677": "Who is to dance?",
  "16678": "That's all you know of him?",
  "16679": "But what business had rushes there, or I among them?",
  "16680": "And in what part of it?",
  "16681": "What have you been doing since I last saw you?",
  "16682": "Did she suffer from heart complaint?",
  "16683": "Could you come?",
  "16684": "Where are these papers, then?",
  "16685": "Yes, but where's your special world?",
  "16686": "Shall you not need an instrument similar to the one which you used yesterday?",
  "16687": "And you've no security?",
  "16688": "And you were his comfort through everything?",
  "16689": "But will he then live for ever?",
  "16690": "When is it likely to come to an end?",
  "16691": "In which, sir?",
  "16692": "At school?",
  "16693": "Greshamsbury?",
  "16694": "Shall I repent of it?",
  "16695": "And do well, I am sure?",
  "16696": "Who brought me here?",
  "16697": "To what extent?",
  "16698": "But whom send I to judge them?",
  "16699": "Now I am sure that you would not be too proud to earn the price of a new dress, would you?",
  "16700": "Where is the key?",
  "16701": "Shall we go together?",
  "16702": "What cable?",
  "16703": "Does he make any conditions?",
  "16704": "Does he say the quotations from his own speech are forgeries?",
  "16705": "Was it a sarpent?",
  "16706": "In different states shall the magistrates be different or the same?",
  "16707": "May not my love, my life, my duty, try to repay the confidence you have shown me?",
  "16708": "You want a pretext, do you not?",
  "16709": "What would the enemy say?",
  "16710": "To whom do you desire to leave this fortune?",
  "16711": "Have you anything to say at all?",
  "16712": "But tell me, is it a civilized country?",
  "16713": "Did you never hear that?",
  "16714": "You mean when money is not wanted, but allowed to lie?",
  "16715": "Perhaps you cannot talk now?",
  "16716": "What do you intend?",
  "16717": "Or do you decline and dissent from this?",
  "16718": "And we have lost an opportunity to get back to our country?",
  "16719": "What, mother?",
  "16720": "And what's this?",
  "16721": "How could you mistake me so?",
  "16722": "What is the matter, gentlemen?",
  "16723": "Are we softened a little?",
  "16724": "How are you getting on with your woman?",
  "16725": "Socrates, what do you mean?",
  "16726": "Six children, sir?",
  "16727": "D'you mean to say you can look at the painting of that flesh and say it's not good?",
  "16728": "Are you not ashamed of yourself?",
  "16729": "Does she know where he has gone to?",
  "16730": "No friends?",
  "16731": "Are they yoked?",
  "16732": "Besides, why should I die?",
  "16733": "How should the bells be rung?",
  "16734": "What sort of a lady is she?",
  "16735": "But am I to remain always alone in this vast and dismal chamber?",
  "16736": "Do you know she is a very virtuous woman?",
  "16737": "Canst drink the waters of the crisped spring?",
  "16738": "What's that you've got?",
  "16739": "What is the difference?",
  "16740": "Will you look at them?",
  "16741": "How shall the mother summon courage to bid him adieu?",
  "16742": "What sort of night was it?",
  "16743": "Your younger sisters must be very young?",
  "16744": "So soon as that?",
  "16745": "My dear, how am I to say?",
  "16746": "Why, what would you do with them?",
  "16747": "Would she have him fire off real guns, and have his hair cut, and his whiskers shaved, and his eyes turned right and left, and his trousers pipeclayed?",
  "16748": "And after all, what did it matter to me, and why did it matter to me?",
  "16749": "But, if you love me you would like me to be your husband?",
  "16750": "And their names?",
  "16751": "Why did you not ask for me at my room if you were in the hotel?",
  "16752": "Ilyin?",
  "16753": "Should not their custom be to spare them, considering the danger which there is that the whole race may one day fall under the yoke of the barbarians?",
  "16754": "Had he been dreaming?",
  "16755": "MacCallum who, sir?",
  "16756": "Why deprive myself of the actual charm of my enjoyments to inform others what I enjoyed?",
  "16757": "My hay for the district?",
  "16758": "What is your proposal?",
  "16759": "And then you heard nothing until you read the reports of the death in the paper?",
  "16760": "How, go then?",
  "16761": "Is he ALWAYS hungry?",
  "16762": "Are you sure it was me?",
  "16763": "Why not history?",
  "16764": "Why do you ask such an unnecessary question?",
  "16765": "Who were his parents?",
  "16766": "Come to see the old man, hay?",
  "16767": "We have the resources, but are we fully ready to use them?",
  "16768": "What shall I do to him, sahib?",
  "16769": "Do you wish to come in?",
  "16770": "Pray, how came you to know that men were formerly fools?",
  "16771": "Oh, is this true what you say?",
  "16772": "You call THAT something to lend?",
  "16773": "Shall we condescend to legislate on any of these particulars?",
  "16774": "Meanwhile, what are you going to do?",
  "16775": "But where was his mind?",
  "16776": "And the matter seems serious to you?",
  "16777": "What's sov'rin, and what's c'u'nity?",
  "16778": "What is it that once or twice they have quarreled with the governor, and because they would not yield have been proclaimed?",
  "16779": "How do you find yourself today?",
  "16780": "When would they return, and how?",
  "16781": "What business had he to talk to her about being taken away from uncles and aunts?",
  "16782": "What is there in the tents?",
  "16783": "Where were you going now?",
  "16784": "His blankets?",
  "16785": "Why not let me take a farm?",
  "16786": "Dare you answer me thus?",
  "16787": "Why, but do you speak this seriously?",
  "16788": "You have nothing else to tell us?",
  "16789": "Could it have lived an hour as happily?",
  "16790": "Would it degrade me as much as to break my faith with the helpless?",
  "16791": "Whom will you send for?",
  "16792": "Now, could she do it?",
  "16793": "All safe inside?",
  "16794": "Well, boys, how does it feel to be in space once more?",
  "16795": "What do you mean by making such a racket?",
  "16796": "But if I accept the appointment, and yet disagree with the bishop, what then?",
  "16797": "Where should she live?",
  "16798": "Have I not tended that dear couch for years?",
  "16799": "Are we not as much so as you?",
  "16800": "Will you meet me there?",
  "16801": "What have I to do, to free myself for ever of your visits, but to abandon you to your deserts?",
  "16802": "Fusion, fusion, this horrible fusion of two beings, which every woman and most men insisted on, was it not nauseous and horrible anyhow, whether it was a fusion of the spirit or of the emotional body?",
  "16803": "What could be the meaning of it?",
  "16804": "Good news, then?",
  "16805": "What is it called, dear guardian?",
  "16806": "Two leagues beyond the summit of the hill?",
  "16807": "Whose for choice?",
  "16808": "Has the rain wrecked the road?",
  "16809": "I ask you now, is such a theory tenable?",
  "16810": "How are you feeling this morning?",
  "16811": "Canoeing?",
  "16812": "How would it be from now on?",
  "16813": "How could he, poor boy?",
  "16814": "Well, on the road itself?",
  "16815": "And how should he know them?",
  "16816": "You will do all you can do, your excellency?",
  "16817": "Where was I?",
  "16818": "Into what room did you take him?",
  "16819": "He hesitated to give it to you?",
  "16820": "Or is it only your good luck?",
  "16821": "Where and when?",
  "16822": "What do you expect me to do?",
  "16823": "Much here else?",
  "16824": "Do you think it will be long before he comes in?",
  "16825": "The father's?",
  "16826": "Did he not lunch with you, cousin?",

  "16834": "Would you like to go into the parlor?",
  "16835": "While his soul had passed from ecstasy to languor where had she been?",
  "16836": "Aint dis here my lef eye for sartain?",
  "16837": "What does it matter whether he does or not?",
  "16838": "Is this nothing?",
  "16839": "Whither go you now?",
  "16840": "Moliere?",
  "16841": "I think only one of your rooms is engaged as yet, is it not?",
  "16842": "Should I not desire its prosperity and its happiness?",
  "16843": "And from what country?",
  "16844": "How did he look?",
  "16845": "Will you be more happy at home?",
  "16846": "What is it, deary?",
  "16847": "But, after all, in order to see, the light must exceed the darkness, and in the midst of the darkness in the water, how can you see?",
  "16848": "Do her friends know my story also?",
  "16849": "You refuse to answer?",
  "16850": "To send a gentleman after him?",
  "16851": "Get over what?",
  "16852": "What have you got to do?",
  "16853": "Was it?",
  "16854": "Does your excellency happen to be hungry?",
  "16855": "Can two passengers in yonder street be more unlike each other than the soul is to the soul after an interval of twenty years?",

  "16858": "Is he going to make it manslaughter, or what's he going to make of it?",
  "16859": "And even to this are there not exceptions?",
  "16860": "Do you never search your heart and shudder at the horrible degradation which you have brought on yourself by sheer weakness of will?",
  "16861": "I am to remain minister, then?",
  "16862": "In a year?",
  "16863": "What does her clever stepfather do then?",
  "16864": "What story can I invent?",
  "16865": "Have you not managed to get out of it?",
  "16866": "Veteran, you must have been often wounded?",

  "16868": "You're there, are you?",
  "16869": "Who is your district ruler?",
  "16870": "What have they to show for their famous conservatories?",
  "16871": "Offensively so?",
  "16872": "Where shall we put it?",
  "16873": "How have you come to know of this?",
  "16874": "Had they tried to get a doctor?",
  "16875": "Where do they get the feathers?",
  "16876": "I hope your father is quite well?",
  "16877": "What's that to you?",
  "16878": "And why do you not go with him?",
  "16879": "And these beings, composed of such noble materials of thinking and feeling, have they only melted into the elements to keep in motion the grand mass of life?",
  "16880": "Do you prefer reading to cards?",
  "16881": "Stay, who nurses him?",
  "16882": "Shall we excuse the desertion of his standard, a treacherous desertion which abandoned the victory to the enemies of his benefactor?",
  "16883": "Will you not answer?",
  "16884": "But what name?",
  "16885": "Has any one ever heard it alleged that, from our complete and necessary ignorance of the conditions, it is uncertain what exact relation the diameter of a circle bears to the circle in rational or irrational numbers?",
  "16886": "Did I see it?",
  "16887": "Have you not then told me that you loved me?",
  "16888": "What else do you want of me?",
  "16889": "How can it ever be otherwise?",

  "16958": "How did you like my reading of the character, gentlemen?",
  "16959": "When would some paper think her photo worth while?",
  "16960": "How are we to explain that fact?",
  "16961": "Do you not believe it is the truth?",

  "16964": "What do you mean, my lord?",
  "16965": "Your husband, aunt?",
  "16966": "Do you really believe that, were this maiden's cause a just one, no knight would have been found for her?",

  "16977": "Shall I intreat a word with you?",
  "16978": "And do you say no more nor that?",
  "16979": "Was the lady looking well?",
  "16980": "Are they working people?",
  "16981": "My own letters, is it possible?",

  "18975": "Will you please lead the way?",
  "18976": "And do you want to?",
  "18977": "Or how can the soul be united with the body and still be independent?",
  "18978": "Where are your companions?",
  "18979": "No interference in the case of desperate intentions, for instance?",
  "18980": "And what of the reading?",
  "18981": "Perhaps they have not heard yet of all that happened here during the night?",
  "18982": "Do you think I have no heart?",
  "18983": "Whats that?",
  "18984": "Then what do you see?",

  "18991": "Which of us has spoken truly?",
  "18992": "In these circumstances, I ask of all honest men, what could I do, and what would they have done in my place?",
  "18993": "Was there any woman who could talk, or sing, or do anything like her?",
  "18994": "Is this state then established according to perfect democratical justice, or rather that which is guided by numbers only?",
  "18995": "And, if that is not just, is it not proper to refuse literary property to every author holding public offices, and receiving pensions or sinecures?",

  "19001": "Who would furnish the money to move?",
  "19002": "Do you suppose it possible that a nation ever will voluntarily emancipate?",
  "19003": "Who cut off your head?",
  "19004": "Who denies that?",
  "19005": "What is it you want to know?",
  "19006": "For some time, is it?",
  "19007": "Yes, who told you?",
  "19008": "He told you himself, I'll be bound, my dear?",
  "19009": "Have I made myself understood?",
  "19010": "In trouble, are you?",
  "19011": "What kept you free?",
  "19012": "Why, aunty, what'll you do now?",
  "19013": "Your defenses are not impregnable, after all, then?",
  "19014": "How can one talk here?",
  "19015": "What had they done with his body afterward?",
  "19016": "Believe that tex?",
  "19017": "Who could have expected such an error in calculation?",
  "19018": "What, for instance?",
  "19019": "What do you want with me?",
  "19020": "What would happen now?",
  "19021": "What has he done to be thus treated?",
  "19022": "Is it a child celestial?",
  "19023": "Who on earth can it be?",
  "19024": "Have you seen anything?",
  "19025": "Related to the family?",
  "19026": "Was so terrible a sacrifice to be the result of my selfish exile?",
  "19027": "What was there to be said?",
  "19028": "The fields?",
  "19029": "Have you ever seen a reaping machine?",
  "19030": "Where was one?",

  "19032": "Not yours?",
  "19033": "What chum of mine could have done it?",
  "19034": "Are you, indeed?",
  "19035": "Who could expect such a people to comprehend the new and strange events of foreign places?",
  "19036": "Besides, where was he to go?",
  "19037": "Will you condescend to do a few sums in simple addition today?",
  "19038": "Then why did he deserve such a whipping as the little girl was giving him?",
  "19039": "What should she come for?",
  "19040": "Did you find that story of mine a good one?",
  "19041": "What's the amount altogether?",
  "19042": "May I ask the cause?",
  "19043": "In the pauses of your work at your city desk, where you have grown rich and avaricious, does it never rise before your mind's eye, the quiet old homestead that knew you as a boy before your greed of gold tore you away from it?",
  "19044": "Have you seen the new helmets?",
  "19045": "What do you want with that?",
  "19046": "We are to turn to the right, did you say?",
  "19047": "Simply in the end of the world, and grass?",

  "19054": "Oh, why?",
  "19055": "Can we not lower the boat?",
  "19056": "Is this well?",
  "19057": "But who shall cuckold me?",
  "19058": "Well, what say you?",
  "19059": "Where have you been, you young monkey?",
  "19060": "Where did you pick up the creature?",
  "19061": "No reports of any stranger seen?",
  "19062": "Are you not feeling well today?",
  "19063": "Have you no choice?",
  "19064": "Will you first let me speak half a word with this gentleman in private?",
  "19065": "Then what made her do it?",
  "19066": "But who am I to speak of the mysteries in the soul of a great woman?",
  "19067": "Should it here be pretended, that the view of convenience may be the source of all the right of succession, and that men gladly take advantage of any rule, by which they can fix the successor of their late sovereign, and prevent that anarchy and confusion, which attends all new elections?",
  "19068": "A pretty woman?",
  "19069": "Where are we going, dear?",
  "19070": "Rich, eh?",
  "19071": "Lasting?",
  "19072": "Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?",
  "19073": "But why do you expect that he will leave us anything?",
  "19074": "Is there anything at all on your mind now?",
  "19075": "Just for convenience' sake?",
  "19076": "What are you doing that you have to lie to me?",
  "19077": "Pray what more could I do?",
  "19078": "Why should I hint, and beat about the bush?",
  "19079": "Why did you come here, anyway?",
  "19080": "And what is better than wisdom?",
  "19081": "You do not believe me?",
  "19082": "But, as he said to himself now very often, what right had he to condemn her if she did nothing that was really wrong?",
  "19083": "What kind of beings existed in this strange boat?",
  "19084": "Do you like it then?",
  "19085": "Even in the last few years what changes can most of you not remember?",
  "19086": "What has he to do with my affairs?",
  "19087": "This a genial room?",
  "19088": "What is that sum, gossip?",
  "19089": "That is to say, that he accepts it?",
  "19090": "How can we know the exact names of everything?",
  "19091": "Leaf's restoration?",
  "19092": "How is he to live?",
  "19093": "Truly, sir?",
  "19094": "Did you speak to her?",
  "19095": "Will you allow me to thank you at least?",
  "19096": "Is it a promise?",
  "19097": "Shall I tell you?",
  "19098": "Why then was this forbid?",
  "19099": "Have you had coffee?",
  "19100": "Whoever heard of anybody becoming so base as that all at once?",
  "19101": "Well, then, the place?",
  "19102": "Is that the truth?",
  "19103": "Or cross the stream, and meet him in the field?",
  "19104": "Why was the court decision held up?",
  "19105": "Who is to hang these three poor wretches?",
  "19106": "What more was there that could be said between them?",

  "19108": "What my commands are?",
  "19109": "Do you find it in our platform, our speeches, our conventions, or anywhere?",
  "19110": "Shall we look upon the match as made, then?",
  "19111": "What is to be said to him, lady?",
  "19112": "What is the rope for?",
  "19113": "Not even your liberty?",
  "19114": "Do not great crimes and the spirit of pure evil spring out of a fulness of nature ruined by education rather than from any inferiority, whereas weak natures are scarcely capable of any very great good or very great evil?",
  "19115": "How many families that would board them?",
  "19116": "By the fruit?",
  "19117": "And you think him capable of being exact?",
  "19118": "Do you pretend to fight against the impossible?",
  "19119": "For what had happened only a few days before?",
  "19120": "Convicts, sergeant?",
  "19121": "Who may that be?",
  "19122": "Are you deaf?",

  "19127": "What is the exact distance which separates the earth from its satellite?",
  "19128": "But what happened?",
  "19129": "Haughty nobleman stuff, eh?",
  "19130": "Ay, ay?",
  "19131": "Whose head?",
  "19132": "I wonder why he has not come to tell me?",
  "19133": "What is he up to, anyway?",
  "19134": "Bourrienne, are we not old comrades?",
  "19135": "Is it objected that it is proposed to authorize the agencies to deal in bills of exchange?",
  "19136": "No damage?",
  "19137": "Where are you, you dirty scamp?",
  "19138": "When we sum up all the useful truths which we owe to that philosophy, to what do they amount?",
  "19139": "Why, I said, what was ever great in a short time?",
  "19140": "Are you an officer?",
  "19141": "The university degree you never obtained?",
  "19142": "I wonder who could have put it there?",
  "19143": "Oh, that's what you are after?",
  "19144": "Gone the least bit beyond sniff and snaff at all?",
  "19145": "What is the news he brings?",
  "19146": "What is he, then?",
  "19147": "Am I to answer, then?",
  "19148": "Then what on earth are you playing at?",
  "19149": "But what is meant by this system?",
  "19150": "What sort of creature is that which approaches us?",
  "19151": "And you say that the same fate is in store for the earth?",
  "19152": "Would you give me the time?",
  "19153": "Well, I suppose it is time we were at table?",
  "19154": "What may that be?",
  "19155": "You consent then?",
  "19156": "It is a man, then, who expects you?",
  "19157": "And would it not be foolish to mourn a calamity above twenty years beforehand?",
  "19158": "What are you dissatisfied with?",
  "19159": "And their souls?",
  "19160": "What surprises you in that?",
  "19161": "Ah, so you know that house too?",
  "19162": "When that bunch got interested and planned to float the company?",
  "19163": "For what is the memory but a faculty, by which we raise up the images of past perceptions?",
  "19164": "You'll put your horse in?",
  "19165": "Was there no other way?",
  "19166": "Then I have leave?",
  "19167": "Why have you disregarded my request?",
  "19168": "The blue room is it not?",
  "19169": "Ambition?",
  "19170": "But I can hardly suppose that you have heard of my name before?",
  "19171": "Who made you?",
  "19172": "Are they only to be met with in the towns or cities?",
  "19173": "And what led you to form such a resolution?",
  "19174": "Why are you accompanying the army?",
  "19175": "Tell me, now, can you deny all this?",
  "19176": "What do they want?",
  "19177": "Well now, well, what's your own theory?",
  "19178": "What is there to declare?",
  "19179": "Can you tell us why?",
  "19180": "Who could have penned them?",
  "19181": "Who buzzeth in mine ears I am a spirit?",
  "19182": "What have you here?",
  "19183": "Why, then, do the supposed late continuators represent tools, not weapons, as of iron?",
  "19184": "Did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism?",
  "19185": "And what prompted your heart, my fair sweet friend?",
  "19186": "What did all this matter to her?",
  "19187": "Do you know what he has done, this child?",
  "19188": "Well, why not, if you're not afraid?",
  "19189": "Where do you expect to go to?",
  "19190": "And you've changed your mind?",
  "19191": "What man would oppose a girl, or dare to harm her?",
  "19192": "Sixteen hours in all?",
  "19193": "But who, sir, makes the trader?",
  "19194": "Is it that the level way through the desert is closed?",
  "19195": "What air?",
  "19196": "How can you let such things alone?",
  "19197": "But do you not think that the best thing to be done now is to openly give chase to these wretches?",

  "19205": "Excommunicated you, my son?",
  "19206": "Why do you not rally, and get to your work like a man?",
  "19207": "What more simple?",
  "19208": "Who wanted them?",
  "19209": "And who told you I had no affair with a lover?",
  "19210": "But are you really so attached to this place as to see no defect in it?",
  "19211": "Do they do?",
  "19212": "Could you do better?",
  "19213": "When, when was this terrible affair decided?",
  "19214": "Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as my sister, how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray?",
  "19215": "And how am I to become his wife unless I love him well enough myself?",

  "19235": "Yes, of course, but which rules?",
  "19236": "Have they, by some miraculous instinct or foresight, set apart in each of them a common place of residence?",
  "19237": "But still, papa, you'll have the dear old house and garden?",
  "19238": "Shall we meet again?",

  "19254": "What bargain are you talking about?",
  "19255": "What is nobler than to succour those we love?",
  "19256": "How do you defend them?",
  "19257": "Colbert?",
  "19258": "How have I?",
  "19259": "It's very ingenious, and she says several pretty things in the process, but what's gained, I'd like to know?",
  "19260": "But who else was there?",
  "19261": "Do I look a sight?",
  "19262": "How can you talk about being like a book, when it makes even me, an outsider, feel sick?",
  "19263": "Did you know him well?",
  "19264": "Who should take the heads off the knot but the man that put the heads on?",

  "19276": "Why are you so unhappy, mother?",
  "19277": "And did you give me tobacco yesterday?",
  "19278": "For the last time, I ask you, will you reply to my questions?",
  "19279": "I wonder if he has forgotten the many unanswerable questions which he propounded to me so fluently on the day when I gave him my last lecture?",
  "19280": "Who is this?",
  "19281": "Suppose he did all this, what then?",
  "19282": "How is it with you?",
  "19283": "Who is that girl?",
  "19284": "What can she have said?",
  "19285": "Must I see my poor chile' go after all my hope to save her?",
  "19286": "Someone else?",
  "19287": "That conveys nothing to you?",
  "19288": "And how was he to meet her again on this very day?",
  "19289": "Who the devil prevents you?",
  "19290": "Then why will you not be my wife?",
  "19291": "In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?",
  "19292": "But who else COULD it be, my very dear prince?",
  "19293": "Do you think it would be unfriendly of me if I said I was busy?",
  "19294": "How old is she?",
  "19295": "WILL you shake hands?",
  "19296": "Did you ever hear of a dog running up a curtain?",
  "19297": "What is all my world after?",
  "19298": "And suppose he should say all he knows?",
  "19299": "Whether they are going to convict, or whatever it is, that dreadful soldier?",
  "19300": "Do you see this diamond?",
  "19301": "Why did he not go?",
  "19302": "Who was this man who held in his finger these curiously variegated links of an unknown chain?",
  "19303": "How much may not a few months do?",
  "19304": "What would this chamber of justice do?",
  "19305": "Well, yes, you are right, I am a fool, why not simply remain here?",
  "19306": "Are you going to shoot me?",
  "19307": "Oh, do you know that it is cruel never to name the name of the loved one?",
  "19308": "Is he quiet?",
  "19309": "A girl, is it?",
  "19310": "Shall a curiosity, which seems to lead nowhere, be satisfied?",
  "19311": "Was there no injustice in this?",
  "19312": "A dead dog, or rabbits, or what?",
  "19313": "Have you plotted to drown me?",
  "19314": "Oh, where was he?",
  "19315": "If I might make a suggestion, sir?",
  "19316": "What decision?",
  "19317": "Have you a mind to go ashore there?",
  "19318": "From number sixty?",
  "19319": "Or was the projectile nothing now but a metal coffin, bearing three corpses into space?",
  "19320": "What is the difficulty?",
  "19321": "How could you shut me out, bear it all alone?",
  "19322": "Would it be an indiscretion to ask to see those precious pills?",
  "19323": "And who is the cause of all this annoyance?",
  "19324": "After this, what more can be wanted?",
  "19325": "Tame?",
  "19326": "Will you take these mementos to him?",
  "19327": "And WHERE has he gone?",
  "19328": "But what is the point of it?",
  "19329": "Might it not be possible that the cheque having thus fallen into her husband's hands, he had come, after a while, to think that it had been sent to him by his friend, the dean?",
  "19330": "And what good is it to the bubble while it holds together, or what harm when it is burst?",
  "19331": "What are you going to do with yourselves after you get settled?",
  "19332": "Is that it, my dear?",
  "19333": "If one is not to get into a rage sometimes, what is the good of being friends?",
  "19334": "Where shall I put all this treasure, and which way shall I go?",
  "19335": "Why not mention these almost divinely childish sayings of kindness?",
  "19336": "Awake?",
  "19337": "Bucket?",
  "19338": "Is any rule more plain than this, that whoever voluntarily gives to another irresistible power over human beings is bound to take order that such power shall not be barbarously abused?",

  "19340": "WHICH one is the poet?",
  "19341": "What if her nerve had given way under the strain?",
  "19342": "What are you up to, little man?",
  "19343": "More powerful than my mother, then?",
  "19344": "You are convinced?",
  "19345": "Yes, why?",
  "19346": "Where did she live?",
  "19347": "Good?",
  "19348": "You love me?",
  "19349": "Why are you so impatient?",
  "19350": "Well, what if it is?",
  "19351": "Shall I ever forget the triple horror of that spectacle?",
  "19352": "Do you deny that?",
  "19353": "Will you turn the hay over to us, the hay in the old stack?",
  "19354": "But that way of arguing by imaginary instances is not supposed to be genuine, is it?",
  "19355": "Or am I going mad?",
  "19356": "What is the price?",
  "19357": "On what shall I reflect?",
  "19358": "So near, are we?",
  "19359": "And will it cost much?",
  "19360": "We are not wrong therefore in calling them necessary?",
  "19361": "Gentlemen, did you ever see a scorpion pinned to a wall?",
  "19362": "But what about the lamps?",
  "19363": "But then?",
  "19364": "And me, too?",
  "19365": "I suppose you gave a goodish figure for him?",
  "19366": "A surprise?",

  "19371": "Absolutely?",
  "19372": "Is this the recompense you had in store for me?",
  "19373": "Shall I go and see if I can find them?",
  "19374": "Will you let me try to mend it for you?",
  "19375": "And for ever?",
  "19376": "You whom I regard as the last word, the last charming and delightful word, in modern womanhood?",
  "19377": "To avoid this dilemma what is proposed?",
  "19378": "Well, have there been reviews of your book?",
  "19379": "Kiss any of them?",
  "19380": "Would he really be permitted to lean on his father's broad breast once more?",
  "19381": "Have you had board and lodging too?",
  "19382": "Frequently?",
  "19383": "What might the staying of my blood portend?",
  "19384": "Mother, do you see this?",
  "19385": "Have you so soon forgotten from whom you received the foolish instrument you hold in your hand?",
  "19386": "Are periodical visits made to the grave?",
  "19387": "Well, now then, the count?",
  "19388": "Whether he had any accomplices, or whatever the thing is called in the law?",
  "19389": "You think it will come to that?",
  "19390": "Cut a man?",
  "19391": "But is there no mitigating circumstance?",
  "19392": "Who are these gentlemen whom you have brought with you?",
  "19393": "Anything down there about your souls?",
  "19394": "What can she do?",
  "19395": "Is there no remedy for this?",
  "19396": "Is this small saving or frugality?",
  "19397": "In danger from you?",
  "19398": "Was the veil about to be rent?",
  "19399": "What were you saying to this youngster?",
  "19400": "Where have you been hiding yourself, you naughty boy?",
  "19401": "How dare you call me flimsy?",
  "19402": "For if the living spring from any other things, and they too die, must not all things at last be swallowed up in death?",
  "19403": "Had she betrayed him?",
  "19404": "Heart, what will you say if this be the appendix or label to both you indentures?",
  "19405": "Witty?",
  "19406": "Did I tell you to come around to day?",
  "19407": "You remember that fellow who came upon the evening before you left us?",
  "19408": "And you did not believe him when he said that?",
  "19409": "How can they?",
  "19410": "And always with the same lady?",
  "19411": "Have you read his article?",
  "19412": "So, then, they drew up the indictments before the king was taken?",
  "19413": "But eternal justice?",
  "19414": "Can you wonder I'm lonesome?",
  "19415": "Is it us?",
  "19416": "Then what do you hope for?",
  "19417": "Is it sweetening yet?",
  "19418": "Should he give to his cowardice the pretext of patriotism?",
  "19419": "What did you let her bring you for?",
  "19420": "At what solution should he arrive?",
  "19421": "Shall I call up our men from beyond the hill?",
  "19422": "My marriage?",
  "19423": "When did such a massacre occur?",
  "19424": "Do you know the town at all?",
  "19425": "Is it because you love her so passionately?",
  "19426": "What is he after?",
  "19427": "Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison?",
  "19428": "Does this oath satisfy you?",
  "19429": "Do you know what you fear most?",
  "19430": "And nothing but them?",
  "19431": "And what did you there?",
  "19432": "Then the guilty person is absolutely in custody?",
  "19433": "For whom the labor?",
  "19434": "What, how, why?",
  "19435": "How am I to know, madam, that in your selection of lovers, you are not equally eccentric?",
  "19436": "Any other point, sir?",
  "19437": "What's the odds?",
  "19438": "What are they?",
  "19439": "What vial and what balsam is that?",

  "19444": "Will you let me have another cup?",
  "19445": "Is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think?",
  "19446": "What are you up to, now?",
  "19447": "Shall I have my son a stager now?",
  "19448": "Whither did he go?",
  "19449": "Pratt?",
  "19450": "Would she?",
  "19451": "Am I insulting?",
  "19452": "How could he order his public execution, and yet, in his letters to the senate, exculpate himself from the guilt of his death?",
  "19453": "And why are you glad?",
  "19454": "Has she told you?",
  "19455": "Are we to go?",
  "19456": "Can one get married as quickly as that?",
  "19457": "By the way, am I your cousin, or am I not?",
  "19458": "Whose opinion is to decide who are the wisest and best?",
  "19459": "What is it to exclude?",
  "19460": "He has agents, then, throughout the world?",
  "19461": "Have you relied on the fidelity of your confederates?",
  "19462": "How is it you're defending him?",
  "19463": "A stranger in these parts?",
  "19464": "Was my uncle beside himself?",
  "19465": "Do you find, sir, said I, that I encouraged his proposal, or do you not?",
  "19466": "Now, governor, the sum?",
  "19467": "But do you know who rescued her?",
  "19468": "Finally, what still remained to be sacrificed?",
  "19469": "Where are you from?",
  "19470": "I wonder who it can be?",
  "19471": "His duty?",
  "19472": "Change the sir to one less poignant?",
  "19473": "What's the use of writing at all if nobody can understand it?",
  "19474": "Another enemy to harass me in my misery?",
  "19475": "Do none suggest themselves?",
  "19476": "And where does one take the air in this island?",
  "19477": "What is that dim outline?",
  "19478": "You have no further doubt, captain, of the nature of the animal?",
  "19479": "Shall we leave the cart in the wood?",
  "19480": "Where, in what manner, was your prisoner found?",
  "19481": "How long has this been going on?",
  "19482": "Have you anything to say to us, my friend, or what do you want?",
  "19483": "General, why have we not had any ices?",
  "19484": "But what have I done?",
  "19485": "Shall we go there?",
  "19486": "Mirabell, did you take exceptions last night?",
  "19487": "What did he think?",
  "19488": "Whom do they hate most?",
  "19489": "Come, now, what are your conditions?",
  "19490": "Was any other bicycle missing?",
  "19491": "What's the good of denying it, my dear?",
  "19492": "Do you think, then, monsieur, that we shall travel faster with two horses apiece?",
  "19493": "A nonentity, sir?",
  "19494": "Did they lose their provisions and starve in the desert?",
  "19495": "But how could she reach it?",
  "19496": "Those who recommend a contempt of mankind, and those who inculcate a reverence for humanity?",
  "19497": "How slowly do the houres theyr numbers spend?",
  "19498": "Do I understand that you will take her with you?",
  "19499": "Great statesmen err, and why not small medical men?",
  "19500": "And none of your people had by chance been to see you?",
  "19501": "Do you not perceive that it would be an agent of safety instead of destruction?",
  "19502": "You see no difficulty, heh?",
  "19503": "Will that do?",
  "19504": "For what sin, or for what crime?",
  "19505": "Like any warm water?",
  "19506": "To reflect?",
  "19507": "How does this bear on the case?",
  "19508": "Well, supposing I and the others refused to serve, as you are doing?",
  "19509": "We?",
  "19510": "Which is worse?",
  "19511": "Well, then, what are they FOR?",
  "19512": "Why did you bring me away?",
  "19513": "You've just come?",
  "19514": "She has a pretty face, has she not?",
  "19515": "But would it make his life harder if we were to see each other sometimes?",
  "19516": "You wished to see me, your lordship?",
  "19517": "By the way, DID he beat you?",
  "19518": "How did the man give it you?",
  "19519": "Who lost it?",
  "19520": "Nothing of what?",
  "19521": "Do you imagine that the convicts will not see you leave it, that they will not allow you to enter the forest, and that they will not attack it during your absence, knowing that there is no one here but a wounded boy and a man?",
  "19522": "And what did these two sovereigns give you in exchange for these magnificent presents?",
  "19523": "If there be no unchanging mirror, bright and clean, bow can there be the various images, unreal and temporary, reflected in it?",
  "19524": "Who are all these people?",
  "19525": "What is it, sir?",
  "19526": "But has she told you nothing?",
  "19527": "Have you no wish in reference to your case?",
  "19528": "That was the way, was it?",
  "19529": "Nothing shall stay me now short of death, and should I die, my friends, will you take oath to prosecute the search for her and bring her back in safety to her grandfather's court?",
  "19530": "Does she refuse me?",
  "19531": "And now tell me, father, while we are still in friendly country, if you know of any resources that I could make my own?",
  "19532": "What's the matter, are you asleep?",
  "19533": "Was my maternal parent aware, in a word, of my absence from the domiciliary residence?",
  "19534": "As we are imagining what is impossible and absurd, suppose we change the subject?",
  "19535": "Is that what he rang for?",
  "19536": "Where will she go?",
  "19537": "Charley does?",
  "19538": "Do you think they have recognized us?",
  "19539": "Do you release her from her promise?",
  "19540": "Why a battle, in the first place?",
  "19541": "When will you go?",
  "19542": "They have in view practice only, and are always speaking?",
  "19543": "She has told you?",
  "19544": "What then is become of that friendship and confidence, and by what means have I lost them?",
  "19545": "Is it a bargain, or is it not?",
  "19546": "Heldar?",
  "19547": "Never even hinted, for instance, that your patron might have views as to your marriage ultimately?",
  "19548": "Do you know of whom I mean to speak?",
  "19549": "So much the worse, is it?",
  "19550": "You would accept?",
  "19551": "They do very well here?",
  "19552": "What was the reason?",
  "19553": "How many have you?",
  "19554": "Shall it be brandy and water?",
  "19555": "How was it, when I saw the personal, the selfish point of view of the voice, that I did not suspect some impostor?",
  "19556": "What should I stay for?",
  "19557": "Do you see this russet?",
  "19558": "What aim, what purpose, what ambition in life have you now?",
  "19559": "How are we to distinguish those that are always valid from others?",
  "19560": "What would that other channel probably be?",
  "19561": "Have you not retained an hotel?",
  "19562": "Was it not very extraordinary that you should do this on the very day when there were these papers inside?",
  "19563": "But would you have any objections to my laying down before the fire?",
  "19564": "How many are of your party?",
  "19565": "Percerin?",
  "19566": "Are you in fear of me still?",
  "19567": "Do I know her?",
  "19568": "Did you know?",
  "19569": "Tell me, are you this young fellow's father?",
  "19570": "Does it?",
  "19571": "Is that far?",
  "19572": "Do you suppose, for a moment, he will not recognise that?",
  "19573": "Have you indeed?",
  "19574": "And his address?",
  "19575": "And yet, what could have happened?",
  "19576": "Will it not, sir?",
  "19577": "Now, why need you do it?",
  "19578": "You have got out insurances on our lives and want to give way with their oars, and pocket the proceeds, do ye?",
  "19579": "If these be the effects of friendship, what are those of enmity?",
  "19580": "How then, upon what conditions, in what sense, can a principle which is its own denial enter into science?",
  "19581": "Come, when do you wish our marriage to be signed in a vestry?",
  "19582": "The name of this creek, my friends?",
  "19583": "About those three or four gentlemen whom you wish to invite here?",
  "19584": "Why do you want the rest?",
  "19585": "Do your people talk about that too?",
  "19586": "Tulliver?",
  "19587": "What do you do instead?",
  "19588": "Why does your ladyship ask?",
  "19589": "Would they be naughty then?",
  "19590": "Was it a bet?",
  "19591": "How dare you come in so?",
  "19592": "But who was to lead the men?",
  "19593": "Or a sausage or something?",
  "19594": "Or was it some one who was with the thief who did it in order to prevent the crime?",
  "19595": "What period?",
  "19596": "Or are we going to hell for orders?",
  "19597": "How could you begin?",
  "19598": "How do you know I am old?",
  "19599": "Why this craving for change?",
  "19600": "But in what way?",
  "19601": "Had he come on board alone?",
  "19602": "How many skates you reckon we'll need?",
  "19603": "Do you ever plant things here?",
  "19604": "And when shall we arrive?",
  "19605": "It's a secret, then?",
  "19606": "Were you in the room when he protested so vehemently that he did not know where he got the money?",
  "19607": "Is it possible that I liked to do what I might not, simply and for no other reason than because I might not?",
  "19608": "What would become of me, if I tried to escape from pain?",
  "19609": "And now?",
  "19610": "Here?",
  "19611": "What have you done, then?",
  "19612": "Supposing we escape on foot?",
  "19613": "When will this organ of popular interests and the electoral reform cease to hire sceptics and spread doubt?",
  "19614": "Not for money?",
  "19615": "And how would you set about it?",
  "19616": "How, then, may you accomplish the impossible?",
  "19617": "And then, sir, do you wish me to speak freely to you?",
  "19618": "Really, have you had a vision of the seven fat kine and the seven lean kine?",
  "19619": "What light then does our new material throw upon traditional origins of civilization?",
  "19620": "Do you know that you are quite rude?",
  "19621": "Why not call it then frankly his complete success?",
  "19622": "In my house?",
  "19623": "Then where will you be?",
  "19624": "But how in the world can it be done?",
  "19625": "And what shall I do now?",
  "19626": "How was it, then?",
  "19627": "By intuition?",
  "19628": "What is the letter that she holds?",
  "19629": "Whose tongue is music now?",
  "19630": "How interpret you that passage?",
  "19631": "Were not they very careful to entertain them well, punctually to look unto them, and to attend them faithfully and circumspectly?",
  "19632": "In what way can I be of service to you?",
  "19633": "HAS he been hiding ever since?",
  "19634": "Much hurt?",
  "19635": "In fear of what?",
  "19636": "Who called me?",
  "19637": "No friend but you?",
  "19638": "Then you're a wizard?",
  "19639": "Are we enthralled with material things, less appreciative of the nobility of work and sacrifice?",
  "19640": "It makes no difference about those four crowns, but why did you get up like this?",
  "19641": "Well, well?",
  "19642": "How began the quarrel betwixt you, ha?",
  "19643": "Why did not you place her on my bed against the moment of my waking?",
  "19644": "What happened there?",
  "19645": "What, then, must other tracts be, more desert than this desert?",
  "19646": "Now, what's that for?",
  "19647": "With what object?",
  "19648": "Did you not get my telegram?",
  "19649": "For what purpose could the enumeration of particular powers be inserted, if these and all others were meant to be included in the preceding general power?",
  "19650": "Then how can you believe anything at all?",
  "19651": "Will you complete me, and let me complete you?",
  "19652": "Nothing?",
  "19653": "How much of futurity did he see?",
  "19654": "What are you thinking of?",

  "19656": "What do you ask me to do?",
  "19657": "She has never behaved like this before, then?",
  "19658": "Are you not satisfied with your own?",
  "19659": "Do you think it necessary to write it?",
  "19660": "And who is it, uncle?",
  "19661": "What now to her was the archdeacon's arrogance, her sister's coldness, or her dear father's weakness?",
  "19662": "Did they, when in the throes of such competition, send formal notice to their rivals of their plans to get the better of them in commerce?",
  "19663": "And must he be more earnest to seduce me, because I dread of all things to be seduced, and would rather lose my life than my honesty?",
  "19664": "Is there not also a second class of goods, such as knowledge, sight, health, which are desirable not only in themselves, but also for their results?",
  "19665": "Why was that?",
  "19666": "What was the population?",
  "19667": "What is the difference between eternal life, fixed and constant, and eternal death?",
  "19668": "Children?",

  "19683": "Then keep quiet, will you?",
  "19684": "How will you do this bloody work?",
  "19685": "S death?",
  "19686": "Did she say where she was going?",
  "19687": "Well, pray, is there anything to be so surprised at?",
  "19688": "Were you asked to tea?",
  "19689": "Is it not better and more honourable to perish in fighting valiantly than to live in disgrace by a cowardly running away?",

  "19700": "Do you recollect the lady's voice?",
  "19701": "And what will you do next, grandmother?",
  "19702": "It must have been the devil who taught it you, was it not?",
  "19703": "You think I'm not capable of opening this packet, do you?",
  "19704": "How long will he last, do you think?",
  "19705": "Is there nothing you can tell me if you will?",

  "19727": "She did not reply, for what could she say?",
  "19728": "Strange, is it not?",
  "19729": "Get rid of something?",
  "19730": "What are you staring at?",
  "19731": "No answer?",
  "19732": "Are you sure this is the place?",

  "20552": "Am I in the habit of seeing such charming people, that I should be very difficult to please?",
  "20553": "Do you think that I can sit in friendship with those who have spoken of her as you have now spoken?",
  "20554": "Why should not I imitate him, and go in by his window?",
  "20555": "What are we looking at, at this moment?",
  "20556": "Why, where can they still find any ground for objection?",
  "20557": "But you know he is now our friend?",
  "20558": "Is not this the case?",
  "20559": "She asked me if ever I had found her tattling to me of other people's affairs, and how could I suspect her?",
  "20560": "Had you not better go and dress?",
  "20561": "What is our sin, after all?",
  "20562": "Is it a good country?",
  "20563": "Possibly you mean that I am one?",
  "20564": "What's the good of thinking about that now?",
  "20565": "Did he speak of sending me to our father?",
  "20566": "And how do you suppose they do this?",
  "20567": "What tidings?",
  "20568": "What possible chance is there for such as you?",
  "20569": "Did you come here, sir, to see the telegraph?",
  "20570": "A political one?",
  "20571": "How can you speak so cruelly?",
  "20572": "Is that you?",
  "20573": "What rascal was it who said that man was a featherless biped?",
  "20574": "D'you want me to?",
  "20575": "Whatever did your wife say?",
  "20576": "What wrong had he done you?",
  "20577": "I wonder what that fellow is looking for?",
  "20578": "What man?",
  "20579": "What would you have, ha?",
  "20580": "And why should I not be turned away, and there's an end of it?",
  "20581": "What would she once have given to have known that her condition at this day should be what it now is?",
  "20582": "Are the miseries of continued possession less horrible than the struggles of the tremendous exorcism?",
  "20583": "What are you thinking of?",
  "20584": "How was she?",
  "20585": "What was on the needle?",
  "20586": "What flavoring did you use?",
  "20587": "So then there's no reason to speak of it?",
  "20588": "And when is the wedding to be?",
  "20589": "Would it not be criminal, were some islanders to repulse, in the name of property, the unfortunate victims of a shipwreck struggling to reach the shore?",
  "20590": "Well, and can the eyes fulfil their end if they are wanting in their own proper excellence and have a defect instead?",
  "20591": "And what is the name of the new commissioner?",
  "20592": "Leave the combat out?",
  "20593": "Must you always adorn every statement with your alleged humor?",
  "20594": "Well, is the grand affair over?",
  "20595": "Does it cease to be wealth, because there is the security of a written acknowledgment for it?",
  "20596": "Do you hear me?",
  "20597": "Pray, madam, do you pin up your hair with all your letters?",
  "20598": "The question now is, what shall we do with this poor wretch's body?",
  "20599": "Does he still live?",
  "20600": "What happens?",
  "20601": "What have you done for your neighbor?",
  "20602": "How could I know it did trouble you, this question, when you never told me so, never spoke of it at all?",
  "20603": "Why is not my heart as independent as his?",
  "20604": "Will you see father?",
  "20605": "Then do you want to see your parents?",
  "20606": "Is that ALL?",
  "20607": "How the devil can she be cuckolded who never yet was married?",
  "20608": "Should she take laudanum, and end it, to have done with all hopes, schemes, debts, and triumphs?",
  "20609": "Doth not the light comfort all the world?",
  "20610": "And what could you say to her?",
  "20611": "How can you tell me that?",
  "20612": "Why are you like this?",
  "20613": "And knows lansquenet?",
  "20614": "Well, do you get a good salary?",
  "20615": "Can you not combine the progressive tendency with a respect for punctuality?",
  "20616": "Have you been locked up?",
  "20617": "Are any plans abandoned?",
  "20618": "How old are you now?",
  "20619": "Do not orders issue from the ministers?",
  "20620": "But on what then?",
  "20621": "Tell me, are grapes and honey lawful or unlawful?",
  "20622": "She is not qulte prostrated by fatigue?",
  "20623": "It is so?",
  "20624": "Tell me what I've said to grieve him?",
  "20625": "And what did I come here for?",
  "20626": "How can you name that superannuated lubber?",
  "20627": "Our position?",
  "20628": "What were you doing there?",
  "20629": "Oh, where will be the end?",
  "20630": "Was that not enough, and more than enough?",
  "20631": "Is therefore that most honorable and most natural of our passions utterly lost, I mean the desire of liberty?",
  "20632": "How long since?",
  "20633": "But how is it conceivable that a nation should find its market clogged because of having got rid of its useless mouths?",
  "20634": "Have you it?",
  "20635": "What did you drive in for?",
  "20636": "What are you laughing at?",
  "20637": "How then did he measure this?",
  "20638": "Gold, really gold?",
  "20639": "What could he have to be conceited about?",
  "20640": "Do you think you could I love him as I did?",
  "20641": "Or was he determined to examine this passage to its farthest extremity?",
  "20642": "The stable lane?",
  "20643": "What have they been doing?",
  "20644": "Are they paid?",
  "20645": "What are all the fittings of my rooms worth?",
  "20646": "Besides, when were your legs known to fail?",
  "20647": "Is there a peculiar flavour in what you sprinkle from your torch?",
  "20648": "Simmonds?",
  "20649": "What makes you want to ask it?",
  "20650": "Agnes?",
  "20651": "What is your line, then?",
  "20652": "Do you expect me to pay for what I did not take?",
  "20653": "And why, pray, does it draggle in this fashion?",
  "20654": "And this sign?",
  "20655": "Did you not hear me?",
  "20656": "How is one to have an opinion if one does not get it by looking at the things that happen around us?",
  "20657": "How can such an immense superiority of numbers be indefinitely resisted?",
  "20658": "I ask you, then, what you mean by this liberty?",
  "20659": "Besides, how could the administration of justice, which rests on fixed, rigid, and unchangeable bases, proceed hand in hand with another administration placed on the quicksand of instantaneous decisions, and surrounded by stratagems and deceptions?",
  "20660": "Make allowances?",
  "20661": "What sense is there in acting like that?",
  "20662": "What shall I do with it?",
  "20663": "You have no family, sir?",
  "20664": "Always from a distance?",
  "20665": "What WAS the letter?",
  "20666": "A specially loud part?",
  "20667": "But where was she left?",
  "20668": "How can I write the check if you'll not speak?",
  "20669": "How is your mother?",
  "20670": "What is the meaning of such strange things?",
  "20671": "Given their vast internal base of operations, and their agents in foreign lands, what are the communist rulers trying to do?",
  "20672": "What are you doing?",
  "20673": "Is she come now?",
  "20674": "Why did you intrude here?",
  "20675": "Will you lend the money?",
  "20676": "Why should it be on this?",
  "20677": "How can she have, if the previous argument holds?",
  "20678": "Have you seen something?",
  "20679": "Was the islet invaded?",
  "20680": "Anne, whatever are you thinking of?",
  "20681": "And what became of them?",
  "20682": "Where is that written?",
  "20683": "At which noise the enemies awaked, but can you tell how?",
  "20684": "Who's he?",
  "20685": "What have you found out?",
  "20686": "And yet, why should my heart be so heavy?",
  "20687": "That weakness in the legs?",
  "20688": "What is there to be afraid of?",
  "20689": "And you see the candles?",
  "20690": "Do you understand, father?",
  "20691": "What way?",
  "20692": "What madness is this?",
  "20693": "What are you going to do, sir?",
  "20694": "Then he can hardly be compelled by external influence to take many shapes?",
  "20695": "You say that man will never put off the body ?",
  "20696": "The secret of which they made an evil use against me?",
  "20697": "Then do you think that the line I take is all wrong?",
  "20698": "Think m' leg is made of iron?",
  "20699": "Why are you in this passion?",
  "20700": "You admit that the vivisected human being, as you called it, is, after all, only the puma?",
  "20701": "Could it have been him?",
  "20702": "When they've even used, how are they?",
  "20703": "Now, does he do too much?",
  "20704": "Who can tell, who can understand, who can even faintly guess, what will be the anguish of longing which shall consume our very being?",
  "20705": "Door kept shut, did you say?",
  "20706": "You know who sent it?",
  "20707": "Our friends?",
  "20708": "Who'd you give the baggage to?",
  "20709": "Who breaks a butterfly upon a wheel?",
  "20710": "And all your servants gone to bed?",
  "20711": "What is the meaning of all these preparations?",
  "20712": "Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?",
  "20713": "He wanted you to marry him?",
  "20714": "What happens to them, then?",
  "20715": "If they are dead by violence, shall the murderers escape?",
  "20716": "Are you not?",
  "20717": "Who might you be wanting?",
  "20718": "Will you be so good?",
  "20719": "How should I know anything of it, sir?",
  "20720": "Is it a great treasure, aunt?",
  "20721": "Then I ask the original question, if each of the pieces of testimony is true, how is it possible that the whole is a falsehood?",
  "20722": "What is slang, properly speaking?",
  "20723": "How did that happen?",
  "20724": "Do you regard the condition as hers then that you spoke of a minute ago?",
  "20725": "Is not the thing feasible?",
  "20726": "Officer?",
  "20727": "What's the good of making us both unhappy?",
  "20728": "And what do you suppose is the count's age?",
  "20729": "Now what is it you ask for?",
  "20730": "Have not names and tones been given unto things that man may refresh himself with them?",
  "20731": "Was it not all true?",
  "20732": "Is it so odd that I should love your brother, whom I have known almost all my life?",
  "20733": "And what do you mean by an epidemic?",
  "20734": "I wonder if you really love me, after all?",
  "20735": "And have you settled it, as you call it, in opposition to the wishes of all your friends?",
  "20736": "Feeling better?",
  "20737": "Pray, sir, what man was that, with whom I saw you in the street last night?",
  "20738": "To come to the point, can we have a word with you in private?",
  "20739": "How should one best advance to meet him, keeping the ranks?",
  "20740": "So many?",
  "20741": "He is your man, do you say?",
  "20742": "Which of these positions has the most of true elevation connected with it?",
  "20743": "Where yo' all been?",
  "20744": "You have been to school?",
  "20745": "Oswald, what is the matter with you?",
  "20746": "What has happened here?",
  "20747": "Would you have tears for him?",
  "20748": "Our lady enters this room, and what does she do?",
  "20749": "Where is human fraternity?",
  "20750": "Why should I be afraid?",
  "20751": "WHAT are you?",
  "20752": "Can you tell me what imitation is?",
  "20753": "Have you ever been employed in a shoe factory before?",
  "20754": "What WILL become of me?",
  "20755": "You mean geometry?",
  "20756": "How do you know he was there?",
  "20757": "To the police?",
  "20758": "May they not rather be described as almost always changing and hardly ever the same, either with themselves or with one another?",
  "20759": "What is longing?",
  "20760": "Is not that enough?",
  "20761": "How is family to avail the wife of a man who has to rough it as I have, and shall have to do?",
  "20762": "Ye will not forget me?",
  "20763": "Why did I not know it?",
  "20764": "And how many men had he with him?",
  "20765": "Well, but if they are ever to run a risk should they not do so on some occasion when, if they escape disaster, they will be the better for it?",
  "20766": "Who can console a heart that has lost all it possessed?",
  "20767": "He believed in himself?",
  "20768": "Now, my sons, doth this ordinance please you?",
  "20769": "Still no better?",
  "20770": "This?",
  "20771": "Who did send for you?",
  "20772": "When would it become a reality?",
  "20773": "Do you hold with a man sacrificing his life for his country?",
  "20774": "Dalmain?",
  "20775": "Why did you leave the surface of the earth?",
  "20776": "We can steer a course, but who's to set one?",
  "20777": "What will you do with me then?",
  "20778": "What references could he give?",
  "20779": "But whither am I bound?",
  "20780": "How very many are not here to listen?",
  "20781": "And what does talking ever do you know?",
  "20782": "Go home?",
  "20783": "Does one ask why she did not make an end to her sufferings?",
  "20784": "Am I the cause of your sin?",
  "20785": "Burdovsky?",
  "20786": "Why should he not one day be lifted above the shoulders of the crowd, and feel that he had won that eminence well?",
  "20787": "Oh, what is the matter?",
  "20788": "If not, what did he feel?",
  "20789": "What the devil can this mean?",
  "20790": "What became of you?",
  "20791": "Is it a toy?",
  "20792": "Where does your nest of robbers hang?",
  "20793": "Rest?",
  "20794": "Did any one else see him?",
  "20795": "Or stupid enough?",
  "20796": "Why should it strive to attain to new conquests, to awaken in its members new wants and strain to satisfy them?",
  "20797": "If we had but a single soul, how could she be at once evil and good?",
  "20798": "Could not you direct the course?",
  "20799": "Where can I go now?",
  "20800": "With no one else?",
  "20801": "I ask you whether I was right in maintaining this?",
  "20802": "And where does he reside?",
  "20803": "Who, then, was this person, and what was the enterprise that he proposed?",
  "20804": "You would like a hero of the road then?",
  "20805": "You're in a hurry?",
  "20806": "Who did you want?",
  "20807": "I suppose there is no other way of fording the river?",
  "20808": "What did you do next?",
  "20809": "What knights?",
  "20810": "Besides, admitting that I pay this time, how can I do so on another occasion?",
  "20811": "Have they foreseen the consequences, calculated the difficulties?",
  "20812": "Our arms?",
  "20813": "And father?",
  "20814": "Have you quite given yourself up to the pleasures of the court?",
  "20815": "If then it is the former, why do I desire to tarry in a fortuitous combination of things and such a disorder?",
  "20816": "Then at eight tomorrow I may go up in the car?",
  "20817": "My motive?",
  "20818": "Is a prison the fit place?",
  "20819": "How could they be so sure that the sound of it would not bring someone on to them?",
  "20820": "And indeed, what is better than to sit by one's fireside in the evening with a book, while the wind beats against the window and the lamp is burning?",
  "20821": "What else is there to do with it?",
  "20822": "Had she seen any example of it in the hordes of purchasers?",
  "20823": "What shall we do when night comes on?",
  "20824": "Whom do you want?",
  "20825": "Is it egoism that leads the young mother to give herself the exquisite pleasure of feeding and caring for her babes?",
  "20826": "Is she a young lady inclined for adventures?",
  "20827": "Aye, my dear?",
  "20828": "Rachael, am I wakin' or dreamin' this dreadfo' night?",
  "20829": "How is the young lady?",
  "20830": "If so, upon what?",
  "20831": "Must we not assent?",
  "20832": "Did you ever see a fellow set out to take possession?",
  "20833": "And how do you like my wine?",
  "20834": "Is there anybody at home?",
  "20835": "Swear what?",

  "20839": "Where can retirement be so complete as here?",
  "20840": "The question was, what would those two do when at last they had come up with their sledges?",
  "20841": "Have you an exact idea of the amount of your fortune?",
  "20842": "Why take that money?",
  "20843": "What is in her heart?",
  "20844": "But what is your purpose?",
  "20845": "Who is the other?",
  "20846": "Was it, in truth, within the bounds of human possibility, that what I now saw was the result, merely, of the habitual practice of this sarcastic imitation?",
  "20847": "Never had any mother?",
  "20848": "Ask me not?",
  "20849": "Why should he mind saying anything of that sort to her now?",
  "20850": "Bury it again and leave them to come and see the ground disturbed?",
  "20851": "And what have you done with your ecclesiastics?",
  "20852": "No more theses, no more glosses upon the fingers or upon benedictions, hey?",
  "20853": "Have medicinal drugs been produced?",
  "20854": "But wherein?",
  "20855": "Something seen, but indescribable, which filled him with dreadful presentiments?",

  "20858": "Any chickens?",
  "20859": "Should he flee from danger after having approached it?",
  "20860": "Whose team is it?",
  "20861": "Do you comprehend the imaginary case?",
  "20862": "What do we want with servants?",
  "20863": "And how did you discover that, my boy?",
  "20864": "Is there any good objection?",
  "20865": "She knows nothing of it?",
  "20866": "Would he hear of that fact which made her cheeks burn as they never used to do?",
  "20867": "What does he want to ask me about this at confession for?",
  "20868": "Is he in bed?",
  "20869": "But if it was threatened by any other influence, would not all men say that the best thing that could be done, if we could not or ought not to destroy it, would be at least to keep it from growing any larger?",
  "20870": "Why especially now?",
  "20871": "Is there any place where they feed one decently?",
  "20872": "Or do you mean that I shall strike you dead?",
  "20873": "Will you allow me to ask why you want to see the captain's hand, in the case that I could find any specimen of it?",
  "20874": "Soda?",
  "20875": "Not more than that?",
  "20876": "Are you willing that I should this evening pass with you the time I generally spend with your mistress?",
  "20877": "SHE pretty?",

  "20888": "What does that mean, dear father?",
  "20889": "Want MORE money?",
  "20890": "But then, what could there be that could produce such an effect?",
  "20891": "Are you aware that she writes to me almost every day?",
  "20892": "Is the young gentleman to come too, sir?",
  "20893": "Or think we that the bond, which unites soul and body is stronger in us than in others, so that there is no blow that may light upon it, of which we need be apprehensive?",
  "20894": "And, by the way, about that door, my friend, I should like to ask you, who know everything, why these wretches of architects, who ought to have the compasses run into them, just to remind them, came to make doorways through which nobody but thin people can pass?",

  "20902": "Is it good news, pleasant news, news to make a man skip and snap his fingers?",
  "20903": "And no one waiting for you outside?",
  "20904": "And an absolute beauty and absolute good?",
  "20905": "Are you her ladyship's property, or somebody else's?",
  "20906": "Does it strike you as dangerous?",
  "20907": "Upon fifty soldiers?",
  "20908": "Who is to drink that?",
  "20909": "Have you got it?",
  "20910": "She will pass here?",
  "20911": "What are you looking at me for?",
  "20912": "Would it not humiliate her to make her ask me twice?",
  "20913": "Told you what?",
  "20914": "How are you when you shake?",
  "20915": "May I say that I became acquainted at an early stage with the trouble which your lordship is unfortunately 'aving with a certain party?",
  "20916": "What's the meaning of that?",
  "20917": "Is your friendship broken off?",
  "20918": "Why wait my luckless hap to see A fault at unawares to ruin me?",
  "20919": "And who do you think they were?",
  "20920": "And where is this man?",
  "20921": "Could they have found a calmer or more peaceful spot to sleep in?",
  "20922": "You see that?",

  "20928": "Why not get yourself a nice little jacket?",
  "20929": "What do you think of it?",
  "20930": "Do you mean aware of HIM?",
  "20931": "Could it be that he had absolutely made up his mind to foster and encourage this odious match?",
  "20932": "Are you afraid of enemies?",
  "20933": "When is it to be done?",
  "20934": "Is he coming toward you or going farther off?",
  "20935": "Where is he going to?",
  "20936": "Davy, do you know where she is?",

  "22134": "What are you thumping the table for?",
  "22135": "Well, supposing I do love him?",
  "22136": "Quid feci?",
  "22137": "Is he alive?",
  "22138": "Does your majesty consent?",
  "22139": "How could I give her up, perhaps to stand her trial for murder?",
  "22140": "But what did my independence avail me, when I had bound myself in new fetters?",
  "22141": "What were these affrighted, shrieking voices calling?",
  "22142": "Did you ever see a man there who is accustomed to walk about with a ruler in his hand?",
  "22143": "Once more, then, what stops you?",
  "22144": "Was I a fool?",
  "22145": "How does he for the bells?",
  "22146": "Why is it that when you awake to the world of realities you nearly always feel, sometimes very vividly, that the vanished dream has carried with it some enigma which you have failed to solve?",
  "22147": "What is stronger?",
  "22148": "After all, what is there for us to fear in this house?",
  "22149": "But did it ever speak thus?",
  "22150": "How much is that?",
  "22151": "You will see him, if he comes up?",
  "22152": "But what was this portion of the globe which had been swallowed by cataclysms?",
  "22153": "What shall I do to him?",
  "22154": "Will you be as frank?",
  "22155": "Who among the people here could possibly think it worth his while to have his head done into marble?",
  "22156": "What shall we say to her?",
  "22157": "Why, what can you earn?",
  "22158": "Where will you meet?",
  "22159": "Today, almost for the first time, I set to work seriously, and what happened?",
  "22160": "You are there, are you, my friend?",
  "22161": "Who could hope ever to do anything to the satisfaction of the press?",
  "22162": "What's the matter naow?",
  "22163": "Now, about the honest hands?",
  "22164": "Would you like to be a gull?",
  "22165": "Why did they want out?",
  "22166": "What are the uses of decisions of courts?",
  "22167": "Oh, that was it?",
  "22168": "How can I be bribed?",
  "22169": "To him or to me?",
  "22170": "Why did you not dissuade him from it?",
  "22171": "Have you anything more to say?",
  "22172": "Any trade?",
  "22173": "What should I do with beans?",
  "22174": "I shall see you again, then, my lord?",
  "22175": "What then shall be done?",
  "22176": "What regulates them?",
  "22177": "Quite sure you can stand it?",
  "22178": "You would not give her pain?",
  "22179": "Tell us, shall we tell her now?",
  "22180": "What am I to call you?",
  "22181": "What do you mean by a struggle?",
  "22182": "How do you do?",
  "22183": "Where'd you get him ?",
  "22184": "Do you wish to take it, and what price will you pay if I let you have the whole of it?",
  "22185": "Is this man in town?",
  "22186": "Any mail?",
  "22187": "D'you ever try it?",
  "22188": "You're playing secretaire?",
  "22189": "And was it really possible and true, that her last darling was to be torn from her?",
  "22190": "What did he care that his aunts were only two ignorant old women?",
  "22191": "Can your name be RUMPELSTILTSKIN?",
  "22192": "Are you not going in, sir?",
  "22193": "Ah, what is that?",
  "22194": "Can you not trust me as a physician when I tell you so?",
  "22195": "Then what, exactly, is your plan for us?",
  "22196": "How did you do that?",
  "22197": "If so, what news?",
  "22198": "Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as his father did before him?",
  "22199": "But when and where had I seen them?",
  "22200": "Did any see it after?",
  "22201": "Lithia?",
  "22202": "Why should not the same sort of thing happen to me?",
  "22203": "Do you think so, really?",
  "22204": "And you would say the same sort of thing of the physician?",
  "22205": "But was it cast after all?",
  "22206": "Both lost?",
  "22207": "Is he so haughty?",
  "22208": "How then can I know, my dear?",
  "22209": "Will not?",
  "22210": "Will it not slap and pinch the envious dowager, that dares to reflect upon its own delicious?",
  "22211": "Can you still lie?",
  "22212": "You wished me to know the reasons?",
  "22213": "Or else, why did she not go out of the neighborhood, and get a situation where she was not known?",
  "22214": "Do you know that he holds terrestrial beings under his control?",
  "22215": "Has she been with you long?",
  "22216": "Or shall we say that they are in harmony with the apparent social will only, and really stand condemned?",
  "22217": "An explanation?",
  "22218": "What shall I be next?",
  "22219": "Where's the larder?",
  "22220": "Suppose a boy sauced you back when you told him to do something?",
  "22221": "Putting ourselves out of the question, what would you think of a girl who could engage herself to any man under such circumstances?",
  "22222": "As at present?",
  "22223": "What is your name?",
  "22224": "Whom have I hurt?",
  "22225": "Do you mean if you give in?",
  "22226": "Or have tasted the bag of the bee?",
  "22227": "For rich caparisons or trapping gay?",
  "22228": "Would you have it?",
  "22229": "What hotel did you manage?",
  "22230": "Where falls the balance of freedoms here?",
  "22231": "What sauce are they most dainty for?",
  "22232": "What will have gained by telling me all this?",
  "22233": "Is there not love in my heart, and constancy in my resolves?",
  "22234": "Were not the odds the other way?",
  "22235": "Did he keep any record of his cases?",
  "22236": "How often have I asked you not to take my things?",
  "22237": "Rank?",
  "22238": "How did it begin, when did it all come about?",
  "22239": "Where do you go?",
  "22240": "Well, what is to be done?",
  "22241": "Can you hear a mewing cat?",
  "22242": "Have you any opinion to offer, count?",
  "22243": "How long must we stay, do you think?",
  "22244": "What, gossip?",
  "22245": "What is the matter with it?",
  "22246": "But may I be allowed to place the mark for the second shooting?",
  "22247": "Have you ever noticed that all little children are blond?",
  "22248": "And that cavalier, that guest, that nobleman who arrived before she came?",
  "22249": "When am I to wear it?",
  "22250": "What made you go blind that sudden?",
  "22251": "How do you communicate?",
  "22252": "Have you enemies, then?",
  "22253": "Which of them will you test?",
  "22254": "Would you really do that?",
  "22255": "How is your old fellow?",
  "22256": "What bottles?",
  "22257": "Could we not keep it as a secret?",
  "22258": "But proportional to what?",
  "22259": "How did you come here?",
  "22260": "What would these insects eat, if we did not pass this way?",
  "22261": "Your advice, then?",
  "22262": "From the monastery?",
  "22263": "Are you not meditating?",
  "22264": "Would you compel such a state of affairs?",
  "22265": "Then how do you know?",
  "22266": "Where must I sleep, then?",
  "22267": "Supposing nobody should ever fetch me, how long would they consent to keep me there?",
  "22268": "And I?",
  "22269": "Are you alone, madam?",
  "22270": "Vulgar?",
  "22271": "Is not this change wrought in your minds a very important change?",
  "22272": "True?",
  "22273": "Shall I run on and stop them?",
  "22274": "What sort of road would that be?",
  "22275": "Is it your intention to go to an hotel, sir?",
  "22276": "Agree with what?",
  "22277": "Shall we go this high very long?",
  "22278": "Up?",
  "22279": "Was it this room?",
  "22280": "Anyone shot a fox?",
  "22281": "Then what business is it of yours?",
  "22282": "Dishonorable?",
  "22283": "What is the steamer's name?",
  "22284": "Do you often go to see it?",
  "22285": "How is it that the convicts are lying yonder dead, in the middle of the enclosure?",
  "22286": "But where should she go?",
  "22287": "You would be afraid to draw such an inference, would you not?",
  "22288": "Why, instead of a revolution, did they not content themselves with a reform?",
  "22289": "Why should you say that?",
  "22290": "And had it ready a nice little pinch of salt to put upon his tail?",
  "22291": "In what direction?",
  "22292": "And why was this?",
  "22293": "Now, did it strike your ladyship that she was like anybody?",
  "22294": "What do you mean to do with him?",
  "22295": "Not caring for their lives, is it?",
  "22296": "Will you promise to sit up with me to bear me company?",
  "22297": "What are you waiting for?",
  "22298": "What bell was that?",
  "22299": "And with you, governor?",
  "22300": "How came the words forth from her?",
  "22301": "Have I not always fought for your glory and interests?",
  "22302": "What, after all, was this blood of which she had taught herself to think so much?",
  "22303": "How do you do?",
  "22304": "But could it be otherwise?",
  "22305": "Must I compel men to render her fitting honor?",
  "22306": "For who gets wealth, that puts not from the shore?",
  "22307": "You feel, in other words, that she lies to you?",
  "22308": "Who has?",
  "22309": "And what crime has he committed?",
  "22310": "And whom are you waiting for?",
  "22311": "Why not say so?",
  "22312": "Nine, ten, eleven?",
  "22313": "And it was a fierce one?",
  "22314": "What is it they 'ad of you, sir?",
  "22315": "What have you been doing all this time, eh?",
  "22316": "Well, what does that lead up to?",
  "22317": "To whom did he call?",
  "22318": "And what are you?",
  "22319": "Could he be dead?",
  "22320": "Will you be willing to leave your present situation and try?",
  "22321": "What else can we do?",
  "22322": "Had he fallen during the attack on his rider, or was he straying in the bush, or had the convicts carried him off?",
  "22323": "How can he tell?",
  "22324": "Is it with me or for me that you are angry?",
  "22325": "Then how is it that I seem to understand them myself?",
  "22326": "What am I to DO with this?",
  "22327": "Where dwell we now?",
  "22328": "Why are they always anxious?",
  "22329": "What man has authority over himself?",
  "22330": "Who attends to them?",
  "22331": "And now, monseigneur, your answer to this proposition?",
  "22332": "And that caused his sister to refuse my brother?",
  "22333": "And you think she would be angry?",
  "22334": "What news have you?",
  "22335": "And have you not seen any of our other friends?",
  "22336": "All I'd done?",
  "22337": "If there are other causes of poverty than competition, does that prevent it from contributing its share?",
  "22338": "Why should I deceive you?",
  "22339": "What is it you fear?",
  "22340": "Faithful to whom?",
  "22341": "Ah, but if you got nothing to eat for ever so long?",
  "22342": "A horror?",
  "22343": "Do you think I was sorry?",
  "22344": "What's the matter?",
  "22345": "What about the chair?",
  "22346": "I suppose you will live with her now?",
  "22347": "Of what consequence is it to me, then, whether he be grateful or not?",
  "22348": "And why should the goblins mind you, pray?",
  "22349": "What villainy is this?",
  "22350": "Blewett?",
  "22351": "At home?",
  "22352": "Why, instead of transports that should have intoxicated me with their deliciousness, did I experience only fears and repugnance?",
  "22353": "Whats he?",
  "22354": "Well, he took that icon home with him for a few days and what did he do?",
  "22355": "Why, we must ask, do you trouble yourself so much about death?",
  "22356": "How does your lady, and how thrives your love?",
  "22357": "The greatest affection of which he is capable?",
  "22358": "Wife?",
  "22359": "A pox, is this your inns o' court breeding, not to know your friends and your relations, your elders, and your betters?",
  "22360": "And what's her name?",
  "22361": "What are those we know?",
  "22362": "Now do you want me to tell you who you are?",
  "22363": "Are you dissatisfied with my service, say?",
  "22364": "What is the object of slaying the spirit of vegetation at any time and above all in spring, when his services are most wanted?",
  "22365": "What is there in your son's face?",
  "22366": "Gone where?",
  "22367": "What length of course do you propose, dear heart?",
  "22368": "In what manner was I protected by him?",
  "22369": "What do you like best?",
  "22370": "Is it customary, I ask you, to help to tenderloin with one's fingers?",
  "22371": "Do you imagine that a person can die like this?",
  "22372": "Have you received the orders, and will you act upon them?",
  "22373": "How are they called who follow others in spite of them?",
  "22374": "Do you mean that you saw the murder?",
  "22375": "Was it not then a man like you and me, who first proposed this law, and by speaking persuaded the ancients?",
  "22376": "A political one, I suppose?",
  "22377": "What, I ask, in that case, would have been your conduct towards her?",
  "22378": "Do I turn to the right, or to the left hand?",
  "22379": "And suppose he falls?",
  "22380": "An expedition, sir?",
  "22381": "Is it not enough to set him thinking about it?",
  "22382": "What am I?",
  "22383": "Do you believe they're his own?",
  "22384": "And if I obtain this son, the object of my most cherished wishes, this son who is so necessary to me, who will take my place with him when I shall be absent?",
  "22385": "But you're not making a mistake?",
  "22386": "Was you a party in anything, ma'am?",
  "22387": "The knight they went to?",
  "22388": "Ask him what?",
  "22389": "Have I done something for the general interest?",
  "22390": "Have they legs and chops?",
  "22391": "What do you mean by this conduct?",
  "22392": "You're not a skater, I suppose?",
  "22393": "With him, aunt?",
  "22394": "Why does he not come to me?",
  "22395": "Among all the unfathomable precipices which surrounded him, which was his choice?",
  "22396": "Mais, monsieur, is it not time to begin to take more counsel of humanity, and less of your courage?",
  "22397": "How shall I requite you?",
  "22398": "Or when he chew'd it?",
  "22399": "How do I know, my dear, what young men do?",
  "22400": "How can I regret when what I did was inevitable?",
  "22401": "Can you have the heart to do it?",
  "22402": "Was not death infinitely more lovely and noble than such a life?",
  "22403": "When shall I set out?",
  "22404": "But what is this on the chest?",
  "22405": "Where's mother?",
  "22406": "Shall we turn?",
  "22407": "And now, do you wish to attend to your letters?",
  "22408": "May it be that, in some fashion or other, you want me?",
  "22409": "Do you know that the least garrison is of twenty companies of infantry?",
  "22410": "Have these confessed?",
  "22411": "Do you suppose I've asked him for an assurance?",
  "22412": "Are you sure it was my house she was coming to?",
  "22413": "And what are those hatfuls of pence and halfpence?",
  "22414": "What does the change mean?",
  "22415": "Monsieur le comte had an enemy there, then?",
  "22416": "Where are you off to?",
  "22417": "Why should this be so?",
  "22418": "His son?",
  "22419": "Well, and what next?",
  "22420": "What, you're on his track?",
  "22421": "Do you expect them today?",
  "22422": "A parson?",
  "22423": "Now, in what sign will the sun then be?",
  "22424": "Is that the way you love your neighbor as yourself?",
  "22425": "If they hear of this, will they let it pass?",
  "22426": "But where are you going,' that you talk about bidding goodbye?",
  "22427": "So you hate each other?",
  "22428": "Do you go home to dinner?",
  "22429": "Tell me how and why am I again a prisoner?",
  "22430": "You intend to look after me, then?",
  "22431": "Is not my husband here?",
  "22432": "And is she gone?",
  "22433": "If he had been your own boy, you would have put him to it, just the same, I suppose?",
  "22434": "We asked who they were?",
  "22435": "Is there not one among them who has seen it all, and who knows it to be true?",
  "22436": "Or cold?",
  "22437": "Are you cold?",
  "22438": "What were the joy of man, what else could give him pleasure, but pretty maids and noble dames?",
  "22439": "Can you not be more definite?",
  "22440": "Who is she, or how did you get her?",
  "22441": "Tell me why you came?",
  "22442": "Or, shall we continue on our way?",
  "22443": "Do you hear the dog?",
  "22444": "Is his dog dead?",
  "22445": "With our business, how can we get away?",
  "22446": "And what is this?",
  "22447": "What will then become of me?",
  "22448": "Even in the midst of joy, may he not be permitted to be gloomy and oppressed?",
  "22449": "And what does his eminence think of this love, which is, by the bye, no secret to anybody?",
  "22450": "How do they act?",
  "22451": "Which do you like best?",
  "22452": "Have you seen the army?",
  "22453": "But what have I here said, that reflections very refined and metaphysical have little or no influence upon us?",
  "22454": "Fwhat?",
  "22455": "They grow out of our knowledge, ma'am?",
  "22456": "But could you think, because the nodding husband would not wake, that e'er the watchful lover slept?",
  "22457": "And the papers?",
  "22458": "Can you not come to me now, at once, before anything terrible happens?",
  "22459": "My card?",
  "22460": "Tell me, I beseech you, what ails you?",
  "22461": "Of what race could these people be?",
  "22462": "Nevyedovsky?",
  "22463": "Where does your highness wish to go?",
  "22464": "Will not you, as well as your brother, intercede with your uncle in our behalf?",
  "22465": "Is SHE coming?",
  "22466": "Did you see her face?",
  "22467": "To love me, perhaps?",
  "22468": "In the first place, what proof have we of the fact?",
  "22469": "What are you trying to do?",
  "22470": "I strive to engage my uncle in my projects for the repair of the ruins, for the culture of those wide bogs and moorlands why is it that he turns away and looks down embarrassed?",
  "22471": "No right to be warden of the hospital, papa?",
  "22472": "When are we to discover them?",
  "22473": "Diamonds on the moon?",
  "22474": "What is your errand, then, with me, sir?",
  "22475": "Why is it that the dogs have failed to bark?",
  "22476": "And yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him?",
  "22477": "And do you think your power as great with the fraternity as monsieur le cure told me it was just now?",
  "22478": "And whose room is this, my dear child?",
  "22479": "And me?",
  "22480": "If that is the case, why wait till evening?",
  "22481": "What children?",
  "22482": "Lemme go with you?",
  "22483": "Is there any other point which I can make clear?",
  "22484": "ITS DECISION WHAT is a battle?",
  "22485": "Do you mean to say it's not of importance?",
  "22486": "Must I speak again?",
  "22487": "You are not laughing?",
  "22488": "Is there any news today?",
  "22489": "Or a fairy in disguise?",
  "22490": "Bingley?",
  "22491": "Let's see it?",
  "22492": "How, got the start?",
  "22493": "How many of such feelings were preserved from that subtle evaporation which robs them of their perfume, that gradually increasing inconstancy which lulls us until we forget to call the dying emotions to account?",
  "22494": "You are going to leave us?",
  "22495": "Wherefore should we linger upon it now?",
  "22496": "But you'll do it?",
  "22497": "Which of my friends, my lord?",
  "22498": "Are you going for a walk?",
  "22499": "What am I going to say?",
  "22500": "What, monsieur, will you leave us so soon?",
  "22501": "It not the blood in your veins as warm as his?",
  "22502": "Why was it useless to try to win any one's favour?",
  "22503": "But in the face of all of them, whose voice appeals unto me?",
  "22504": "Imprimis, he is older than my father?",
  "22505": "What has been the result of the first war?",
  "22506": "And you have promised?",
  "22507": "Have you the money with you?",
  "22508": "So you were at the races, baron?",
  "22509": "Dolly, why have you disobeyed me?",
  "22510": "So, that's it, is it?",
  "22511": "Do?",
  "22512": "Do you not see them doing the same?",
  "22513": "Does the lady go with us, my father?",
  "22514": "Never seen anchor weighed before?",
  "22515": "Do you burrow, or live in a tree?",
  "22516": "Where had he obtained that blouse?",
  "22517": "Sith then mine evil fortune would have it so, pray tell me, are any of the strangers still alive?",
  "22518": "Where's that?",
  "22519": "Some herb vodka?",
  "22520": "Nay?",
  "22521": "You hailed me, I think?",
  "22522": "And what do you want here?",
  "22523": "Is it a door with a lock to it?",
  "22524": "Is that honestly said?",
  "22525": "How could that be?",
  "22526": "And why should they not say so?",
  "22527": "Have you the diamond?",
  "22528": "Or the eastern?",
  "22529": "Is he aiming at doing anything, or simply undoing what's been done?",
  "22530": "Might he be called perfectly virtuous?",
  "22531": "But what else could she do?",
  "22532": "How ken I?",

  "23335": "If we had no war out of it when thus placed, wherein is the ground of belief that we shall have war out of it if we return to that policy?",
  "23336": "Why do you ask me such a question?",
  "23337": "Who was speaking?",
  "23338": "And, if you will let me for a moment speak of the very highest forms of literature, do we not regard them as highest simply because the more we know the truer they seem, and the more competent we are to appreciate beauty the more beautiful they are?",
  "23339": "What defect?",
  "23340": "You're sure about the money?",

  "24854": "What CAN all that green stuff be?",
  "24855": "Do you recognize your quondam pupil, professor?",
  "24856": "I require to be let alone?",
  "24857": "Can he even see the feature?",
  "24858": "Well, why have I worried him, for five years, and never let him go free?",
  "24859": "But meantime, how am I to get on with my washing?",
  "24860": "Are there then chains for two which are forged on high?",
  "24861": "How could you have gone away and left me?",
  "24862": "How many kingdoms are there at present in the world, and how many more do we find in history, whose governors have no better foundation for their authority than that of present possession?",
  "24863": "Is any better than experience and wisdom and reason?",
  "24864": "But can that which is neither become both?",
  "24865": "But he really is disinterested, and above small jealousy and spite, I have heard?",
  "24866": "And he rests now, near his companions, in the coral cemetery?",
  "24867": "What are we to do, now?",
  "24868": "And now, where is he gone?",
  "24869": "Do you not need to mitigate the struggle for existence more sanguine than the war of weapons?",
  "24870": "When will he come back?",
  "24871": "And why should I not dare?",
  "24872": "And is he in love perchance?",
  "24873": "Surely, this was not the only cause of estrangement?",
  "24874": "Where had he heard the name before?",
  "24875": "Where's my mother?",
  "24876": "Were you looking for us?",
  "24877": "But tell me, and tell me true, what is the meaning of all this feasting, and who are these people?",
  "24878": "Has it begun?",
  "24879": "Where are you taking me?",
  "24880": "What's all this?",
  "24881": "Shall you be present in the reception room?",
  "24882": "What was the matter?",
  "24883": "What magazine, or treasury of bliss?",
  "24884": "What do I think?",
  "24885": "Ah, why DID he?",
  "24886": "How could I ask you to gif up so much for a poor old fellow, who has no fortune but a little learning?",
  "24887": "Is it quite certain?",
  "24888": "Clayton?",
  "24889": "Why do you not think so?",
  "24890": "And you will permit me to accompany you?",
  "24891": "And you can refuse, you mean, eh?",
  "24892": "What, then, was there left to do?",
  "24893": "What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed?",
  "24894": "Are you so sure?",
  "24895": "Is that too simple a source of pleasure for some to prize?",
  "24896": "Then you knew her before?",
  "24897": "Have you not asked papa for money?",
  "24898": "Is there anything whimsical about me?",
  "24899": "Is this ingratitude, however?",
  "24900": "For nothing?",
  "24901": "The winch, you say?",
  "24902": "Was ever a man in such a fearful fool's position?",
  "24903": "But this kind man who has done so much will, I am sure, take you right on to my house?",
  "24904": "But if no one among us is capable of governing himself, then who among us has the capacity to govern someone else?",
  "24905": "Was personal happiness the aim and object of their ambition?",
  "24906": "Have you ever seen a wire jacket?",
  "24907": "Cranmer awaits us in the private chapel?",
  "24908": "And how about today's telegram?",
  "24909": "Where had that daring singer got to?",
  "24910": "Was it he who threw us that bottle, when the vessel made her first cruise?",
  "24911": "Brilliant?",
  "24912": "Now, what is competition?",
  "24913": "Do you know that you are speaking to me quite as a friend?",
  "24914": "What do you do then?",
  "24915": "Do you think we live as cheaply as we might?",
  "24916": "Surely there are classified lists?",
  "24917": "Why ride into the middle of the battalion?",
  "24918": "May I ask if you can confirm these statements?",
  "24919": "Is not this an infallible and sovereign antidote?",
  "24920": "Well, what's this now?",
  "24921": "Now, what have we a right to possess?",
  "24922": "A cigarette?",
  "24923": "But what did he do, my dear?",
  "24924": "What act?",
  "24925": "What in thunder is it?",
  "24926": "And the man?",
  "24927": "How am I to understand you, mon pere?",
  "24928": "Why dilate upon what everybody knows?",
  "24929": "Might this be for you, sir?",
  "24930": "How can you learn lessons in here?",
  "24931": "Who be these?",
  "24932": "Do you love my son?",
  "24933": "What follows that angel?",
  "24934": "Will it strengthen our families and support our children?",
  "24935": "Why where should I leave them but where I found them?",
  "24936": "Shall he now be arrested in his desolating career?",
  "24937": "Do you know what that means?",
  "24938": "But why should I make a long story of it?",
  "24939": "Are you not jealous at all?",
  "24940": "And do you believe it to be so?",
  "24941": "Do you take milk in yours?",
  "24942": "What fiend is this?",
  "24943": "Where are they?",
  "24944": "Would any one believe it?",
  "24945": "What if I've accepted too passively the funny form of our life?",
  "24946": "What, indeed, can tend to deprave the character more than outward submission and inward contempt?",
  "24947": "If they bite and kick?",
  "24948": "Is there that about me that should affright a man?",
  "24949": "For how can any experience be adequate with an idea?",
  "24950": "What is this I hear about you?",
  "24951": "How old are you, dear?",
  "24952": "I wonder if they made that fearful sound I heard just before you came?",
  "24953": "What made them kick you out?",
  "24954": "Am I allowed to repeat it?",
  "24955": "I think that this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with me for six o'clock?",
  "24956": "Have you any dice in your pocket?",
  "24957": "What on earth put such a notion into your head?",
  "24958": "None belonging to your father?",
  "24959": "What had he to say?",
  "24960": "Owing to him?",
  "24961": "To me, sir?",
  "24962": "What do you suppose she wants to talk about tomorrow?",
  "24963": "Would he say a lie?",
  "24964": "How much money had these men fraudulently obtained?",
  "24965": "How many have you loved?",
  "24966": "Then why, when you were able to run away, did you go back to him?",
  "24967": "You are alone?",
  "24968": "What are your favourite flowers?",
  "24969": "By your misfortune?",
  "24970": "Now are you satisfied?",
  "24971": "Who is your lady friend with the big grey envelope and the fat monogram outside?",
  "24972": "How many millions upon millions of centuries would pass before that bird had carried away even a square foot of that mountain, how many eons upon eons of ages before it had carried away all?",
  "24973": "Have you got them?",
  "24974": "Did you get lost?",
  "24975": "I wonder how he felt when he heard it?",
  "24976": "What need for weapon?",
  "24977": "Weevle?",
  "24978": "Are we falling?",
  "24979": "And by character?",
  "24980": "And would not a really good education furnish the best safeguard?",
  "24981": "What manner of man are you?",
  "24982": "And that one?",
  "24983": "Has he ever taken from the rich that he did not give again to the poor?",
  "24984": "Has your mother relented at last?",
  "24985": "What do you want to do?",
  "24986": "Is this all your spinning, grandmother?",
  "24987": "What sort of ship?",
  "24988": "And do they not share?",
  "24989": "Shall I meet strange, heavenly things?",
  "24990": "What is that thing?",
  "24991": "But who else?",
  "24992": "Why, how?",
  "24993": "Do you hear, my children?",
  "24994": "Can you deny that all that was craft and deceit and fraud and greed?",
  "24995": "How shall we set about it?",
  "24996": "Not too difficult?",
  "24997": "Were his father's religious devotion, his teachers warnings, his own knowledge, his own search able to keep him safe?",
  "24998": "Should they be embarked?",
  "24999": "Is my experience but of yesterday?",
  "25000": "Can I trust in you?",
  "25001": "Are you in earnest?",
  "25002": "Where are you to go?",
  "25003": "Do you want to earn half a crown?",
  "25004": "Wilcox?",
  "25005": "What do I mean?",
  "25006": "But will no one remain in the house, my lord?",
  "25007": "How, then, with these variations and with revenues so uncertain, can we establish even distribution and uniform wages for laborers?",
  "25008": "Of the hearses?",
  "25009": "But will you not drink with me, sir?",
  "25010": "What avail is it?",
  "25011": "Oh, I must, hey?",
  "25012": "What more natural than to imagine that the violets and the hyacinths, the roses and the anemones, sprang from their dust, were empurpled or incarnadined by their blood, and contained some portion of their spirit?",
  "25013": "Or are they both in this their own reward?",
  "25014": "What do we do?",
  "25015": "How will you live?",
  "25016": "Will you remember that, if you please?",
  "25017": "Does he read ee very long zermons, my dear?",
  "25018": "What is a passport?",
  "25019": "How long do you remain in town?",
  "25020": "Where shall I see the head of him which contrived to murder his father, which I will tear to pieces with my own hands?",
  "25021": "Why this absence of mind, and sweet irresolution?",
  "25022": "We better than you?",
  "25023": "Did this mad wife of his carry it off with her?",
  "25024": "Had the man seen through him?",
  "25025": "But will you promise to have me took there, sir, and laid along with him?",
  "25026": "But if I do not marry?",
  "25027": "Why did he interfere with me, and fill your mind with such falsehood?",
  "25028": "But when one has no experience, how can one tell what is sickness and what is health?",
  "25029": "How can you tell who is poor?",
  "25030": "Is it so precious?",
  "25031": "Why am I to be disturbed?",
  "25032": "Will you take my advice?",
  "25033": "Something important?",
  "25034": "Perhaps you think I am mad, eh?",
  "25035": "Shall you have the courage?",
  "25036": "Will you forget him?",
  "25037": "Wait for you?",
  "25038": "Now, what fault can you point out in him?",
  "25039": "CUI BONO?",
  "25040": "Where had the dragon gone in such a short space of time?",
  "25041": "You've got a friend here?",
  "25042": "What has he made you?",
  "25043": "You keep the registers of entries and departures?",
  "25044": "To what tribe do they belong?",
  "25045": "And then?",
  "25046": "What does your wife want?",
  "25047": "It was his life or mine, but far more than that, it was his life or hers, for how could I leave her in the power of this madman?",
  "25048": "How did I get hold of that?",
  "25049": "Whatever is the matter?",
  "25050": "And it is true that you did not set it on fire?",
  "25051": "Has anything unpleasant happened since I saw you?",
  "25052": "Is it believed that axioms in metaphysics, declarations of right, harangues from the tribune, will put a stop to the disbanding of an army?",
  "25053": "What does not a man undergo for the sake of a cure?",
  "25054": "You a member here?",
  "25055": "What is your own experience of him?",
  "25056": "Me, young ladies?",
  "25057": "What are these corruptions?",
  "25058": "Why must he look farther than their platform when he claims himself to stand by his platform?",
  "25059": "Now, surely, if he takes so warmly to people who are not related to him at all, may he not take as warmly to his own kin?",
  "25060": "Not since the humour of gentility was upon you, did you?",
  "25061": "Governor come round?",
  "25062": "That boy's tutor?",
  "25063": "What is a soul?",
  "25064": "And with our wives?",
  "25065": "Who would think of plotting with a poor little weak creature like me?",
  "25066": "What is his exact kin to us, mother?",
  "25067": "Is this a new brand of humour?",
  "25068": "Yes, what were we talking about?",
  "25069": "Do I know them?",
  "25070": "And what business have you here?",
  "25071": "You know who bricks and mortar is, I suppose, sir?",
  "25072": "Oh, what's the use of me saying anything?",
  "25073": "I make the first advances?",
  "25074": "Why strive for the knowledge of things if we become more cowardly thereby?",
  "25075": "Why, how do you come to be here?",
  "25076": "What the devil is he doing here?",
  "25077": "What's he to do with the lassie?",
  "25078": "Why must people kneel down to pray?",
  "25079": "Do you like him?",
  "25080": "First tell the boys, what we have decided?",
  "25081": "What is it to be?",
  "25082": "Tell us, dear, what do the creatures look like?",
  "25083": "Do you see that whale now?",
  "25084": "How is it that there are birds enough ready to replace immediately a lost mate of either sex?",
  "25085": "You admit, I hope, that I have a right to speak about what concerns the dignity of my wife's sister?",
  "25086": "Will somebody hand me anything hard and bruising to pelt at her?",
  "25087": "Is he industrious at his work and respectful to you?",
  "25088": "Could her face inspire passion at all now?",
  "25089": "Why ought I to know?",
  "25090": "And you are not furious?",
  "25091": "Will you let me go away?",
  "25092": "Or at some public school, perhaps?",
  "25093": "They do, do they?",
  "25094": "Is not the night mournful, sad, and melancholic?",
  "25095": "I asked them, if they were at liberty to tell me the truth of what they were to do with me?",
  "25096": "Why are you sorry, sir?",
  "25097": "What prison is he in?",
  "25098": "Shall we go on, your excellency, fine champagne?",
  "25099": "Leave our brother to come to us?",
  "25100": "Will you really not have tea?",
  "25101": "Whom do you expect to find here?",
  "25102": "Have you no other to propose?",
  "25103": "What can a writer, who professes scepticism, have in common with radical views?",
  "25104": "See that blue dory behind him?",
  "25105": "But is an education which ignores them all a liberal education?",
  "25106": "What upon?",
  "25107": "But who has told you?",
  "25108": "Where are my priwileges?",
  "25109": "Well, did she say what she was coming for?",
  "25110": "How can I ever thank you?",
  "25111": "You own the name and renounce the alias?",
  "25112": "Is he of noble family, and rich?",
  "25113": "How then are we to begin our strike to destroy him?",
  "25114": "Who is this boy?",
  "25115": "And who hit you at all?",
  "25116": "What are these men's leading principles, and about what kind of things are they busy, and for what kind of reasons do they love and honor?",
  "25117": "Thornfield?",
  "25118": "May I ask if you are very busy just now?",
  "25119": "How can it concern him to learn how the self came to be what it is, or what it will be in the distant future?",
  "25120": "You think it will?",
  "25121": "But why should I weary you with details?",
  "25122": "So you kept him after all?",
  "25123": "And the queen?",
  "25124": "That we see before our noses?",
  "25125": "Can I never tell my story in a plain, straightforward way?",
  "25126": "Can competition in labor be abolished?",
  "25127": "You cannot help us?",
  "25128": "But what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance?",
  "25129": "What was the use of his being somewhere in the neighbourhood if she had no means of knowing where she could find him?",
  "25130": "You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?",
  "25131": "You will protect me from him?",
  "25132": "Had you heard?",
  "25133": "Can you remember that?",
  "25134": "Ever live by cheating at play?",
  "25135": "Why do you permit such a surgeon to have the care of the sick, wounded, and dying soldiers?",
  "25136": "And is that why he hits her?",
  "25137": "Why, what is there to understand?",
  "25138": "Yet you have a large establishment, too, I am told?",
  "25139": "And you think that I am going to send you back to that world which must know me no more?",
  "25140": "What is done to infanticides in this country?",
  "25141": "And did you see anyone?",
  "25142": "Well, then, what makes you talk so wild?",
  "25143": "You have formed one, then?",
  "25144": "Will you please pardon my rudeness?",
  "25145": "My dear father, may I beg you to prepare your mind for what I am going to say?",
  "25146": "With what my father said just now?",
  "25147": "What did you think of that, sir?",
  "25148": "Would you like me to sit down for a minute or two?",
  "25149": "He is going with you, is he not?",
  "25150": "Of what disposition is he?",
  "25151": "What is it, then?",
  "25152": "Where did you really get them?",
  "25153": "What did you expect to gain by that?",
  "25154": "What heart can hold?",
  "25155": "Had he left her there to her fate in the lonely jungle?",
  "25156": "How do you do, all of you?",
  "25157": "Do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not talk as fast, and admire what she admires as rapturously as herself?",
  "25158": "Curious?",
  "25159": "Do you intend to sit up for me?",
  "25160": "But would the man acknowledge the relation?",
  "25161": "What are you doing now?",
  "25162": "Do you suppose that if I had made such a revelation to the king, I should have been alive now?",
  "25163": "He had a passion for pictures, and why should he not be able to paint as well as anybody else?",
  "25164": "Are you the gentleman who caused the accident?",
  "25165": "And the pay?",
  "25166": "Husband?",
  "25167": "I know what everyone would say is the right thing to do, but what do you say?",
  "25168": "What difference can it make to you?",
  "25169": "Was he a proprietor, or only a usufructuary?",
  "25170": "You have sold all your clothes?",
  "25171": "Surely you learnt that too?",
  "25172": "WHAT is it?",
  "25173": "But at this moment who knows if we may not be frightfully crushed between the two glassy surfaces?",
  "25174": "We must take care that that affair comes off all right, must we not?",
  "25175": "Why do you shake me like that?",
  "25176": "Now really should a cock be brought into a tragic play?",
  "25177": "Is his thread spun?",
  "25178": "Is it, then, impossible that, in the present condition of society, the workshop with its hierarchical organization, and machinery, instead of serving exclusively the interests of the least numerous, the least industrious, and the wealthiest class, should be employed for the benefit of all?",
  "25179": "Have not you an intimate friend?",
  "25180": "But how, and wherewith?",
  "25181": "That was a very different account of matters, was it not?",
  "25182": "What laws mean you?",
  "25183": "And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps?",
  "25184": "And on what will you sleep?",
  "25185": "That is what comes of your gospel of love, is it?",
  "25186": "Beautiful?",
  "25187": "Is it really possible that perfectly innocent people are kept here?",
  "25188": "You know the road?",
  "25189": "So if I say they're gone, you'll bear me witness, will you?",
  "25190": "Why should you not mention the sum?",
  "25191": "To what a devil, then, said he, serve so many paltry heaps and bundles of papers and copies which you give me?",
  "25192": "How did you get such small small legs?",
  "25193": "What is that news?",
  "25194": "His nieces accompany him, no doubt?",
  "25195": "Well, but whom are you attacking?",
  "25196": "Am I fool?",
  "25197": "What should hinder it?",
  "25198": "Is this true, my pulse?",
  "25199": "Have you given in your resignation, mademoiselle?",
  "25200": "How can you make yourself so inferior to me, as to show such a bad spirit?",
  "25201": "How can that be managed?",
  "25202": "When shall we be able to fish again?",
  "25203": "And what may your purpose be, most lofty lady?",
  "25204": "And when the better part of their products are consumed by others at the play, do you assure me that their families are not in want?",
  "25205": "Do I combine?",
  "25206": "What good was there in doing that?",
  "25207": "How can you do it seriously?",
  "25208": "Read?",
  "25209": "Was I absurd?",
  "25210": "Live like this?",
  "25211": "And if I could, what comfort to me?",
  "25212": "Aglaya, may I kiss YOUR prince?",
  "25213": "You mean to ask, I said, what will be our answer?",
  "25214": "You do not mean to inherit that infamous crotchet my brother has got into his head?",
  "25215": "Not a circus?",
  "25216": "Well, what have you got in your ear?",
  "25217": "What came of it?",
  "25218": "What makes it smell so funny?",
  "25219": "Which way are you going?",
  "25220": "Sure, little woman?",
  "25221": "The boy's, then?",
  "25222": "Why do you delay?",
  "25223": "Proud, eh?",
  "25224": "Since no man has aught of what he leaves, what is't to leave betimes?",
  "25225": "How is he?",
  "25226": "Were there not the brilliant particles of a halo in the air about his head?",
  "25227": "I therefore turned towards him with a stern countenance, and asked, who he called fool?",
  "25228": "You want me to swear?",
  "25229": "What you standing there for?",
  "25230": "Perhaps he is just as fond of suffering?",
  "25231": "What's the matter with you, old man?",
  "25232": "Married woman, I believe?",
  "25233": "Will you grant it to me?",
  "25234": "And the chin, with its dimples, as in health, might it not be hers?",
  "25235": "What will happen then?",
  "25236": "You mean that the thing is supernatural?",
  "25237": "And if I do speak to her, my lord, what then?",
  "25238": "Was it sufficient?",
  "25239": "Have you ever committed a sin?",
  "25240": "Presented to whom?",
  "25241": "Not for myself?",
  "25242": "Well, sir, will you go?",
  "25243": "Where did you go?",
  "25244": "What have we done?",
  "25245": "Do you jog hither, wagging your tails, to pant at my wine, and bepiss my barrel?",

  "25250": "Outspoken, is she?",
  "25251": "Is it honouring your husband to dishonour his business?",
  "25252": "To whom resort for relief?",
  "25253": "What must be done then?",
  "25254": "Are yours like that?",
  "25255": "And now, are you aware of one thing, monsieur?",
  "25256": "Is he on this farm?",
  "25257": "Now, did you not think so?",
  "25258": "What do men know about women's martyrdoms?",
  "25259": "What can be done?",
  "25260": "Is the room to be got ready upstairs?",
  "25261": "Will you be silent?",
  "25262": "But how could she?",
  "25263": "How shall I bring forth my wife?",
  "25264": "And the greater the interval which separates them from philosophy and reason, the more strange and illusive will be the pleasure?",
  "25265": "Does he also desire his archic man to be got up in a manner befitting royalty at a certain date?",
  "25266": "What can I do for you, my child?",
  "25267": "Well, the question is, what do you know about her?",
  "25268": "Suppose that she coulde pittie me, what then?",
  "25269": "Where is the child?",
  "25270": "What will you take?",
  "25271": "But who could have foreseen such an attention as this?",
  "25272": "Do you know I have entrusted him with our secret?",
  "25273": "Your sister is dead, then?",
  "25274": "What have I done to displease you?",
  "25275": "How begot, how nourished?",
  "25276": "What was the good of playing?",
  "25277": "Would she not be marvellously fair to look upon when in happy mood, seeing that she is so fair in her displeasure?",
  "25278": "Any youngsters?",
  "25279": "Can a man who possesses the slightest common sense be so unreasonable?",
  "25280": "Have you kept him in the cellar all this time?",
  "25281": "Did either of you boys touch it?",
  "25282": "Why has HE done nothing?",
  "25283": "Arrest you, my most faithful servant?",
  "25284": "Why did she betray the two of them so terribly, in embracing the glow of the evening?",
  "25285": "Are you a missionary?",
  "25286": "And in what condition?",
  "25287": "Did they have any repinings because of their course?",

  "25296": "His blushes, his stumbles, his awkwardness, and the number of feet which he crushed as he went back to his place, who shall describe or calculate?",
  "25297": "So what does it matter?",
  "25298": "Or whether we should hold that cowardice makes no difference in the end, seeing that we all must share alike?",
  "25299": "You probably are not aware that I am here on a public kind of business, preposterous enough in itself, but which I have gone in for, and sworn by, and am supposed to be devoted to in quite a desperate manner?",
  "25300": "Now, do you find the business good, and the investment advantageous?",
  "25301": "And I dare say you sing a little, too?",
  "25302": "Was she normal?",
  "25303": "Are their heads off?",
  "25304": "This page or this page?",
  "25305": "What kind of a man is he?",
  "25306": "Will you tell me how that came about?",
  "25307": "For how can we know all the possible cases that may arise?",
  "25308": "Unfortunately, my lord, I am acquainted with nobody here but your grace, and if I should no longer find you, or if you should have forgotten me in your greatness?",
  "25309": "And why should she expect her brother to do that which her brother's guests would decline to do?",
  "25310": "What was there in the young girl's glance on this occasion?",
  "25311": "And then, why did he not at least answer it?",
  "25312": "But where are they, then?",
  "25313": "And then he can write back to my address, and I can smuggle the letter to you?",
  "25314": "Won what, ma'am?",
  "25315": "What dreadful thing drives her to say this, father, when it is such a pain to her?",
  "25316": "How long would the race endure if the parental instinct were wholly lacking?",
  "25317": "What then, my gentle sister?",
  "25318": "Which of the two will be the first to fall?",
  "25319": "Was this the right corner to turn?",
  "25320": "What are we?",

  "25322": "Get it?",
  "25323": "Whose hand's out?",
  "25324": "Alas, do you love nothing else in me?",
  "25325": "Shall we send the watch there?",
  "25326": "Would you mind my taking 'em out and looking at 'em for a minute, to see how they are made?",
  "25327": "Would you believe it?",
  "25328": "But you were married?",
  "25329": "Jespersen?",
  "25330": "Is papa alive?",
  "25331": "How is she?",
  "25332": "What do the overhanging warehouses make of that?",
  "25333": "Mathematics?",
  "25334": "And is not the creation of justice the institution of a natural order and government of one by another in the parts of the soul, and the creation of injustice the production of a state of things at variance with the natural order?",
  "25335": "But is it so?",
  "25336": "And with whom?",
  "25337": "What has it turned to, then?",
  "25338": "What would she say if she knew the truth?",
  "25339": "You loved your mother, then?",
  "25340": "I wonder what we both did that for?",
  "25341": "Damn you, sir, will you let me look inside that cab?",
  "25342": "Is there no voice in your mother's heart that forbids you to destroy your son's ideals?",
  "25343": "Been havin' a snooze, ole boy?",
  "25344": "Have you the tact?",
  "25345": "I could even go with you now?",
  "25346": "What shall you wear?",
  "25347": "How large is the garland?",
  "25348": "You are wrong, and what can you do better with your leisure hours?",
  "25349": "What did you do next?",
  "25350": "Well, where are you taking me, then?",
  "25351": "What was it he talked about?",
  "25352": "Will it hold water?",
  "25353": "Is this the missis?",
  "25354": "How shall the lots be drawn?",
  "25355": "Cannot make you understand WHAT?",
  "25356": "What'll they think of us?",
  "25357": "Who would have believed it?",
  "25358": "What means this woman?",
  "25359": "And turn all the people of the villages against us?",
  "25360": "What's the matter with the old man attending to him personally?",
  "25361": "Would you like supper?",
  "25362": "What do you say, monsieur?",
  "25363": "Do you want to know what it is in him?",
  "25364": "And why would you either?",
  "25365": "Will you wait here?",
  "25366": "Doctor seen them?",
  "25367": "Talk about men who deserve the name, can any man deserving the name waste his time in that effeminate way, when he sees half the world going to ruin for want of somebody to buckle to and teach them how to breast the misery they are born to?",
  "25368": "So there's nothing?",
  "25369": "And shall we eat bread?",
  "25370": "Ankle all right, eh?",
  "25371": "But who was she?",
  "25372": "Why should there often be so great a difference in the result of a reciprocal cross between the same two species?",
  "25373": "Is there any better or equal hope in the world?",
  "25374": "But I wanted to ask you directly what you think of me, of my life?",
  "25375": "Are you quite impervious to good advice?",
  "25376": "What is the matter with me?",
  "25377": "Did you see herself?",
  "25378": "Are we lovers?",
  "25379": "And how could you think o' going to the pond, and taking your sister where there was dirt?",
  "25380": "What lineage, what lineage?",
  "25381": "Did you post that letter yourself?",
  "25382": "But is it a kind heart?",
  "25383": "Shall we descend to the party at all?",
  "25384": "You are not playing with us?",
  "25385": "What other view could he have?",
  "25386": "And because you fear that it may be?",
  "25387": "Such a thing as a what?",
  "25388": "Are you trying to find out something bad about me?",
  "25389": "You lost your school and good income through her, did you not?",
  "25390": "Shall I take her to a coach?",
  "25391": "Was it his profile that was seen on the blind two nights before?",
  "25392": "When you became engaged to the young lady whom you have just mentioned, did you make a regular proposal to her family?",
  "25393": "Do all astronomers admit the existence of this satellite?",
  "25394": "What were we created for?",
  "25395": "I well know, that let you do as you will you will have in your favor the testimony of your conscience, but will this alone be sufficient, and is it permitted to neglect to a certain degree that which is necessary to acquire the approbation of others?",
  "25396": "Is there any drinkable wine in your tavern?",
  "25397": "To my lady's?",
  "25398": "Society?",
  "25399": "Was he the only passenger who came on board at that untimely hour?",
  "25400": "Did you take part in the campaign?",
  "25401": "Alone?",
  "25402": "Did you groan?",
  "25403": "Is he not a handsome man?",
  "25404": "Why pique all mortals, yet affect a name?",
  "25405": "Can you come directly?",
  "25406": "Have you never heard these respectable men, when they got home again, talking about the way in which immorality runs rampant abroad?",
  "25407": "Did I think she was alive?",
  "25408": "About the way in which we've treated that angel of a girl?",
  "25409": "By nothing?",
  "25410": "You watch while I sleep and you have come to bring me some news?",
  "25411": "And what object or consideration more pleasing than this can be presented to the human mind?",
  "25412": "Where did you go to school?",
  "25413": "Did you see the exquisite old lace she sent me?",
  "25414": "Which was first, thirst or drinking?",
  "25415": "What had become of him?",
  "25416": "Expectations?",
  "25417": "You are?",
  "25418": "Lan?",
  "25419": "Shall she giggle or grin?",
  "25420": "How can we not always think of her?",
  "25421": "YOU of importance to him in any way?",
  "25422": "Nor sold him anything, perhaps?",
  "25423": "Do you wish me to tell you it is good?",
  "25424": "Will you excuse me if I leave you for half an hour?",
  "25425": "What is to do?",
  "25426": "Who told you that?",
  "25427": "Does your majesty wish for your attendants at once?",
  "25428": "Will your business take long to state?",
  "25429": "Yes, dear boy?",
  "25430": "If we jest at them, what will our servants do?",
  "25431": "Have you tried him on the subject?",
  "25432": "Some of you gentlemen going to play for me this evening?",
  "25433": "May he, mother?",
  "25434": "Were?",
  "25435": "Why hush?",
  "25436": "Where are you off to now?",
  "25437": "Who nailed him?",
  "25438": "Have you no clue, can you suggest no clue, to their recovery?",
  "25439": "What may be your calling?",
  "25440": "What the value of those literary charms which are absolutely destroyed by their enjoyment?",
  "25441": "Has not that fire, that lies harmless and unseen in the sticks, the power to consume the whole country?",
  "25442": "You would often see him?",
  "25443": "How must I quit her?",
  "25444": "Can it be that it is all over?",
  "25445": "And, he will come presently?",
  "25446": "What did he say to you?",
  "25447": "Old frippery?",
  "25448": "Shall I tell him you're here?",
  "25449": "If his purpose were innocent, why did he not say so?",
  "25450": "Why did you keep me standing there in the cold?",
  "25451": "Now, the means of realizing these contradictory characteristics?",
  "25452": "What do you make of all this?",
  "25453": "What was the consequence?",
  "25454": "Have we not raised it?",
  "25455": "Do you think, then, that any harm can have happened to him?",
  "25456": "Have these birds come to contend for the double stadium prize?",
  "25457": "You think, then, that the case is hopeful?",
  "25458": "And if they are not, but these should be in the same situation with respect to their property which they are in other cities, what sort of a community will there be?",
  "25459": "Then why did you say you had business with the general?",
  "25460": "What was the extraordinary catastrophe that had transformed her?",
  "25461": "But what is that in the distance?",
  "25462": "Are we not here?",
  "25463": "Then how doth one know there was poison given at all?",
  "25464": "Why, bless you, child, what are you thinking of?",
  "25465": "It may well be asked, could such artistically shaded ornaments have been formed by means of sexual selection?",
  "25466": "What business has a pick and a shovel here?",
  "25467": "You'd have come here?",
  "25468": "After all, who among you will be in a position to guarantee payment if all the flocks die?",
  "25469": "So now, sir mechanic, the terms?",
  "25470": "Is the dear old lady dead?",
  "25471": "You have not put out your whole venture yet, have you?",
  "25472": "Suppose that some enemy of his old life had tracked him down and committed this crime, what possible reason could he have for taking his wedding ring?",
  "25473": "Why, what do you mean by this?",
  "25474": "Of what years is the knight, fair damsel?",
  "25475": "When is a man to be safe from such wit, if age and infirmity will not protect him?",
  "25476": "Have you seen the old lady?",
  "25477": "Even when I am alone with you, shall I never be allowed to address you otherwise than with that reverence and restrain which is due the queen?",
  "25478": "Permit me to ask, sir, from where do you know my name?",
  "25479": "What the anvil?",
  "25480": "What place will the moon occupy in the heavens at the moment of the projectile's departure?",
  "25481": "How was it that this delightful crisis did not secure our mutual felicity for the remainder of her life and mine?",
  "25482": "But what can they now do?",
  "25483": "Does it hurt your sense of the family dignity?",
  "25484": "What is it you mean?",
  "25485": "Shall I give him a pass for that object?",
  "25486": "Bunburyist?",
  "25487": "Are you satisfied then that the quality which makes such men and such states is justice, or do you hope to discover some other?",
  "25488": "But what do you want them for, for decoration, or to send away, or what?",
  "25489": "The wind?",
  "25490": "But you will be left alone?",
  "25491": "You have solved it already?",
  "25492": "Implacable theorists of authority, what then do you propose which the government upon which you make war cannot accomplish in a fashion more tolerable than yours?",
  "25493": "What is your father's name?",
  "25494": "Does it not well become the economists who devise such reforms to laugh at the reformers?",
  "25495": "Where were you born, cook?",
  "25496": "An old friend of mine?",
  "25497": "Then three has no part in the even?",
  "25498": "Understand?",
  "25499": "But past who can recall, or done undo?",
  "25500": "Who said you had?",
  "25501": "Bagnet?",
  "25502": "What do you wish me to say?",
  "25503": "Can he take her in?",
  "25504": "Will you not, for me, take that place?",
  "25505": "On the highroad?",
  "25506": "Why handsome?",
  "25507": "And where does she live?",
  "25508": "And which way may you be travelling?",
  "25509": "Do you say she makes a good living out of stories like this?",
  "25510": "Are you fond of the theatre?",
  "25511": "But is it not I that speed him hence, my liege?",
  "25512": "Was it so terrible?",
  "25513": "Oh, was he there?",
  "25514": "What do I mean, more than I know?",
  "25515": "And did he answer forcibly or feebly?",
  "25516": "Well, what did you see?",
  "25517": "What can we do to expedite matters?",
  "25518": "At what time was he coming?",
  "25519": "How's your project of painting the hall coming on?",
  "25520": "Hair?",
  "25521": "But would he?",
  "25522": "For what crime?",
  "25523": "And the spot?",
  "25524": "What have you done to him?",
  "25525": "Because of the divorce, I suppose?",
  "25526": "Why are you doing that at the gate?",
  "25527": "Has this hermit any hens, do you think?",
  "25528": "So I can be of no use to you?",
  "25529": "What are you doing, then?",
  "25530": "Why are you not merry then?",
  "25531": "Bankers' safes had been forced before now, and why should not mine be?",
  "25532": "Why do you not do what I tell you?",
  "25533": "Does your cruelty withhold my fate?",
  "25534": "What made her die, then?",
  "25535": "Shall we see you again to give us any information?",
  "25536": "In what, then, have you deceived me, tell me?",

  "25545": "Where to now, your excellency?",
  "25546": "There it is again, do you hear?",
  "25547": "With what degree of impartiality?",
  "25548": "Have you had dinner yet?",
  "25549": "What are my servants?",
  "25550": "Who is able to tell if the world shall last yet three years?",
  "25551": "What then, when you've made a real fair start with your material things?",
  "25552": "Why do you talk in such a changed way?",
  "25553": "What defence can we make?",
  "25554": "It's not pleasant, but what's to be done, my dear fellow?",
  "25555": "Do fingerprints show racial characteristics?",
  "25556": "Gone deaf in an hour?",

  "25559": "Did you see nothing there?",
  "25560": "Do you steal fur?",
  "25561": "What do I touch?",
  "25562": "Do we see them or hear of them?",
  "25563": "But why, then, should there not be a tariff for farmers as well as for bakers?",
  "25564": "Have not all railings and gangways fallen into the water?",
  "25565": "Sir, will your bounty know no limits?",
  "25566": "Do you desire clearer evidence than this?",
  "25567": "Well, sir, I suppose you wanted to make me look ridiculous?",
  "25568": "What do I want with yours?",
  "25569": "When was you married, then?",
  "25570": "What doctor?",
  "25571": "WHAT, THEN, IS THE TRUTH IN RELATION TO US, AND WHAT IS THE CHARACTER OF CERTAINTY?",
  "25572": "Count, what am I bound to do, being in possession of this secret?",
  "25573": "What about the shotgun?",
  "25574": "What was it that poor old man tried once or twice in vain to say?",
  "25575": "What, is he gone?",
  "25576": "Soft, who is this?",
  "25577": "How like you that, sir king?",
  "25578": "And how can they be expected to relish in a lover what they do not, or very imperfectly, possess themselves?",
  "25579": "What is all this?",
  "25580": "You're not satisfied, are you?",
  "25581": "What is there to explain?",
  "25582": "But, surely, you said that it was a new brown boot?",
  "25583": "Did you, sir?",
  "25584": "He is enamour'd of the fashion, is he?",
  "25585": "Reborn, then, in what form?",
  "25586": "And what if you should?",
  "25587": "Are you only just up?",
  "25588": "And how will she get it?",
  "25589": "Are not the very poor with you there as elsewhere?",
  "25590": "But what was the meaning of it all?",
  "25591": "Cannot you understand how nearly it touches me?",
  "25592": "Dressed as you are?",
  "25593": "Has it never struck you that the way to catch that man was to find out where he got his food, and so trace it to him?",
  "25594": "How then, sir?",
  "25595": "Can it be that extremes meet, and that the very excess and splendour of her mind led her by means of some strange physical reaction to worship at the shrine of matter?",
  "25596": "What shall she say?",
  "25597": "In what way?",
  "25598": "Was it not enough that you should waste so much good property of mine while I was yet a boy?",
  "25599": "Do I really belong to them?",
  "25600": "Which shall I tell you first?",
  "25601": "Why serious?",
  "25602": "Do you think he really likes me?",
  "25603": "How are my friends faring?",
  "25604": "How should she not be known if she were walking about these streets?",
  "25605": "And, if so, to whom would the right of trover belong?",
  "25606": "Somebody incautiously asked, what from?",
  "25607": "Why did you come to me?",
  "25608": "But then, how got you away at last?",
  "25609": "If the acts of the poet have sometimes denied the spirit of his song, have not his songs still more powerfully denied his acts?",
  "25610": "Have you nothing to say to me?",
  "25611": "How's that, young lady?",
  "25612": "And have you long held this faith?",
  "25613": "Was not she at this very moment quite alone?",
  "25614": "Shall we take him now?",
  "25615": "Who gave you leave to prowl about?",
  "25616": "And how old are you?",

  "25618": "What does a dead person look like?",
  "25619": "If violent winds, raging fires, and icy cold, lend their influence to the torments of hell, why may not milder sufferings be derived from the song of the nightingale, from the fragrance of flowers, from the murmur of the brook, or from the moral affections themselves?",
  "25620": "He is within that house?",
  "25621": "I'll tell you now if you promise?",
  "25622": "But why has monsieur le cardinal given all this money at once?",
  "25623": "You'll shake hands with them and so forth?",
  "25624": "As what?",
  "25625": "You imagine him capable of writing the letter?",

  "27186": "Would they not rather boldly resolve to perpetuate themselves in office by one decisive act of usurpation, than to trust to precarious expedients which, in spite of all the precautions that might accompany them, might terminate in the dismission, disgrace, and ruin of their authors?",
  "27187": "We have to ask, in what respects does the interrelation between mind and body resemble the relation between a coat and a nail?",
  "27188": "What is the matter?",
  "27189": "And the steamboat?",
  "27190": "She went back to that place?",
  "27191": "Have you sufficiently observed the wonders it covers, its fishes, its zoophytes, its parterres of sponges, and its forests of coral?",
  "27192": "Why do you run so, mamma?",
  "27193": "Who wants your love, man?",
  "27194": "Rather out of condition still, hey?",
  "27195": "Was it outside, in the air?",
  "27196": "What would he think?",
  "27197": "That charming young woman with her is her daughter?",
  "27198": "Found your way up here?",
  "27199": "You can read?",
  "27200": "How can you let her?",
  "27201": "What is all this about?",
  "27202": "Why have you hated him?",
  "27203": "Is not this a marvellous thing, that he has forced a passage here?",
  "27204": "Now then, ladies and gentlemen, where are your congratulations?",
  "27205": "When you might be doing decent work among us out there?",
  "27206": "How could she serve me?",
  "27207": "But why have two of each sort?",
  "27208": "Does he not call the other pleasures necessary, under the idea that if there were no necessity for them, he would rather not have them?",
  "27209": "You'd like her for your honeymoon?",
  "27210": "For what are you, my young friend?",
  "27211": "And yet you come here, and tell me such a dreadful lie as you did just now, eh?",
  "27212": "Well, sir, what of this?",
  "27213": "Will you?",
  "27214": "Whither would they first go when they turned their back upon the door inside which there had at any rate been shelter for them for so many years?",
  "27215": "Do you hear me, some of you?",
  "27216": "If I flee from her, there's a law to punish me?",
  "27217": "Can you not guess?",
  "27218": "Who knows what will come in sight round the bend of the valley there?",
  "27219": "What's the last joke?",
  "27220": "How then do service which offends his shade?",
  "27221": "Then you were not engaged to marry him?",
  "27222": "Can it be laid down as a general rule that the movement of political and religious truth is rather downwards from the government to the people than upwards from the people to the government?",
  "27223": "Did not you ask it for anything?",
  "27224": "Can I speak with him?",
  "27225": "And to feel not exactly dull, but sad?",
  "27226": "Was it near, was it far?",
  "27227": "Neither, I said, can there be any question that the guardian who is to keep anything should have eyes rather than no eyes?",
  "27228": "Damn it, did you then take me along with you for your chaplain, to sing mass and shrive you?",
  "27229": "What is the liberty of the press?",
  "27230": "Would she throw away the inestimable advantage of royal protection?",
  "27231": "In whom can we trust?",
  "27232": "Then how is it that you did not go?",
  "27233": "And what reward have they?",
  "27234": "Would you care to try it?",
  "27235": "See what, sir?",
  "27236": "What else could I say when he asked me?",
  "27237": "Are you willing to carry us through the air wherever we wish to go?",
  "27238": "Suppose it was all a gigantic mistake?",
  "27239": "Why out of the question?",
  "27240": "Is your secret of enough importance to me to spare your life for it?",
  "27241": "Oh?",
  "27242": "What more can I desire?",
  "27243": "What would he say then?",
  "27244": "Where are these lamps?",
  "27245": "Who, mother?",
  "27246": "You are studying topography?",
  "27247": "What rent do you pay here?",
  "27248": "Now, do you want any more?",
  "27249": "Is there anything wrong?",
  "27250": "How could that be possible?",
  "27251": "How could angels bear the sight?",
  "27252": "What's the answer?",
  "27253": "What do you mean by the proposal you made just now?",
  "27254": "I surmise you also are quits?",
  "27255": "What sort of wood is't?",
  "27256": "Do you consider me so?",
  "27257": "How do I know what I was before?",
  "27258": "Shall I see you again ere my departure?",
  "27259": "Am I alarmed?",
  "27260": "And ought not the rational principle, which is wise, and has the care of the whole soul, to rule, and the passionate or spirited principle to be the subject and ally?",
  "27261": "How long a start have they?",
  "27262": "What, monsieur?",
  "27263": "Till at last he be?",
  "27264": "And what was there in a simple curl of fair hair to appall that brutal man, familiar with every form of cruelty?",
  "27265": "In love with HER?",
  "27266": "But we would agree to make him rich enough to live, I suppose?",
  "27267": "But why do I say, in this case?",
  "27268": "He will be superintendent?",
  "27269": "Your sentence of death, if any soul hears you?",
  "27270": "What embarrassment?",
  "27271": "How do you do, dear friend?",
  "27272": "Have you got the key, auntie?",
  "27273": "What's a captive?",
  "27274": "Can that, with any sort of justice, be styled a blunder?",
  "27275": "But may I not write a note to tell him why I cannot come?",
  "27276": "Meanin' aour packets?",
  "27277": "Why did he do it?",
  "27278": "Has his housekeeper gone too?",
  "27279": "What do you like?",
  "27280": "You have observed that?",
  "27281": "She and I were like sisters, and now she is gone, will you not let me be like a sister to you in your trouble?",
  "27282": "And is there any opposite to life?",
  "27283": "Well?",
  "27284": "What am I to do if I love nothing but fame and men's esteem?",
  "27285": "What do you see there?",
  "27286": "How should a man tell you who knows everything?",
  "27287": "Of what did he die?",
  "27288": "The convicts?",
  "27289": "Who was ever successful in true love?",
  "27290": "Does he?",
  "27291": "Why should we not get him?",
  "27292": "But when the poet speaks in the person of another, may we not say that he assimilates his style to that of the person who, as he informs you, is going to speak?",

  "27295": "Could it be possible that she should her have to encounter another amorous swain?",
  "27296": "If I catch him there again, shall I have the right to thrash him and her also?",
  "27297": "Is not this the time for us to go back?",
  "27298": "Ha, what?",
  "27299": "If so, whose?",
  "27300": "And what do you want to do now?",
  "27301": "And the windows too?",
  "27302": "Is there anything the matter, father?",
  "27303": "How do you cure the shivers?",
  "27304": "You have lost one of your boots?",
  "27305": "How comes it that he is unknown?",
  "27306": "What sort of a man is that?",
  "27307": "You have been into the church?",
  "27308": "Is it so beautiful as all that?",
  "27309": "Well, what are you doing there, then?",
  "27310": "Are you used to burglary, may I ask?",
  "27311": "And you are NOT, I presume, eh?",
  "27312": "I wonder why?",
  "27313": "Would he come and see her in spite of his mother?",
  "27314": "And what did they see?",
  "27315": "What sort of lives do the majority of folk lead?",
  "27316": "What in the act of offering?",

  "27320": "Then the soul is immortal?",
  "27321": "Yes, yes, it's your sting, and you are a wasp, that's what you are, a wasp, do you hear?",
  "27322": "Can a man be too cruel to his mother's enemy?",
  "27323": "What child can that be?",
  "27324": "We are to meet as usual?",
  "27325": "Why can I not, on the contrary, say ill enough of her to prevent your going to her?",
  "27326": "Shall we say that they represent the actual social will of the community until such time as they are done away with by a successful revolution?",
  "27327": "But there's good art in me?",
  "27328": "And how do you like it?",
  "27329": "And higher still?",
  "27330": "What does that matter to me?",

  "27342": "Alas, what would become of me who can only atone for evil by doing good?",

  "27370": "Have I any time to spare?",
  "27371": "Well, what does she want now?",
  "27372": "But do you know why I am saying all this?",
  "27373": "Do you not come in the king's name?",

  "27379": "What meaneth this restless wagging of her slouchy chaps?",
  "27380": "And anything else?",
  "27381": "How do I know it?",
  "27382": "But what's to be done?",
  "27383": "And why did you never meet the lion or the bear or the leopard in fair fight on equal terms, but were always trying to steal some advantage over them?",
  "27384": "What is a trousseau?",
  "27385": "Where's the burnisher?",

  "27394": "No, never?",
  "27395": "Has the whelp been playing that game long?",
  "27396": "And what has he said to that?",
  "27397": "And your friend still longs to be made a baron?",
  "27398": "Would you tell me, please?",
  "27399": "Did you put any thing particular in it?",
  "27400": "But would the end really be his own convenience?",
  "27401": "I suppose I'd better not come back with him?",

  "27436": "On what subject shall I converse with her?",
  "27437": "Have you taken any precautions?",
  "27438": "You have unmasked this false prince also?",
  "27439": "Were you walking in your sleep?",
  "27440": "Are you aware, sir, that we have gone to enormous expense to resist this iniquitous attempt of yours?",
  "27441": "Will you hold the horse while I stick them on?",
  "27442": "Well, then, I must go?",
  "27443": "Is it the solitary cell you want?",
  "27444": "Have you anything to say?",
  "27445": "You were not surprised, I dare say?",
  "27446": "How can I help laws?",
  "27447": "You could not tell vs if his sonne were there?",
  "27448": "No garters?",

  "27458": "What is he going to do?",
  "27459": "Now what was the colonel to do?",
  "27460": "May I ask what is the cause of this unseemly noise?",
  "27461": "If it should break forth into a storm, who can insure us that in its progress a part of its fury would not be spent upon us?",

  "27463": "Might I come some other day?",
  "27464": "Go for a soldier, do you mean?",
  "27465": "But what did the mere reckoning of years matter when he felt as young in heart as he had been twenty years ago?",
  "27466": "How could a garden be shut up?",
  "27467": "Your wife or your daughter?",
  "27468": "So that you could see he knew what was between the two wretches?",
  "27469": "But who is there in the world that can boast of having fathomed or understood the wavering mind and unstable nature of a woman?",
  "27470": "Did you ever behold streets so insufferably narrow, or houses so miraculously tall?",
  "27471": "How can they know?",

  "27483": "How could you possibly know that?",
  "27484": "Why so insensible to my uncle's interests?",
  "27485": "And the possibility has been acknowledged?",
  "27486": "Your ruin?",
  "27487": "Do you mean in point of reward?",
  "27488": "But how long have you been here that you are ignorant of all this?",
  "27489": "Would there ever come to him a time of freedom?",
  "27490": "Will you bear, therefore, will you bear to see your sanctuary trampled on?",
  "27491": "Even if the squire should afterwards hear of his having been there, what would it matter?",
  "27492": "She said I was prudent and virtuous?",
  "27493": "How are you to get away from here?",
  "27494": "You are confident that the thief came in a cab?",
  "27495": "What could he want?",
  "27496": "Why not have kept hold of it with both hands, with both knees, when it was about to flee from her?",
  "27497": "But to what does all this lead?",
  "27498": "How do the bass chords run?",
  "27499": "Does it mean that the risk is not so great as we who have seen the abnormal and not the normal side of taking risks with icebergs might suppose?",

  "27508": "How did you fare?",
  "27509": "Who does it come from?",
  "27510": "What happened within her?",
  "27511": "Whom had he to consult but himself now?",

  "27513": "Are they going to sacrifice the children who seek the learning, or the sick who need medical care, or the families who dwell in squalor now brightened by the hope of home?",
  "27514": "What stable?",
  "27515": "Do I look ugly?",
  "27516": "Can you lift me into that tree and put a rifle in my hands?",
  "27517": "Shall I tell you what you were thinking to yourself just then?",

  "27526": "Are you likely to be more humane to me than others were yesterday?",
  "27527": "Was it my imagination that there was an undertone of fear rather than of hope in the question?",
  "27528": "What could have caused it?",
  "27529": "Is he a scholar, or a soldier?",
  "27530": "And to confer upon me the favour of your distinguished recommendation?",
  "27531": "How can he keep him?",
  "27532": "Surely you have felt that it is so?",
  "27533": "Could there be a development of knowledge in the absence of curiosity?",
  "27534": "Do the old fellows bother you?",
  "27535": "If what?",
  "27536": "And how have you been getting on?",

  "27545": "Who's here?",
  "27546": "Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring?",
  "27547": "And it is asked by what authority this bold and radical innovation was undertaken?",
  "27548": "I asked him upon this if he ever disputed with his wife?",
  "27549": "Sirrah, who gave you a commission to lie in my lordship?",
  "27550": "How can I tell?",
  "27551": "How could I let him?",
  "27552": "What hand and brain went ever pair'd?",
  "27553": "Why did you write me such a horrid letter, you naughty boy?",
  "27554": "Or can I ever see one?",
  "27555": "Quite?",
  "27556": "What is she vexed with him about?",
  "27557": "Has it not happened to all of us, in certain supreme conjunctures, to stop our ears in order that we may not hear the reply, after we have asked a question?",
  "27558": "To do that, my joy?",
  "27559": "And later?",
  "27560": "But what language is it?",
  "27561": "Lucy dear, do you know why I tell you all this?",
  "27562": "How did they come to love each other?",
  "27563": "But what are you going to do to repay us for the past?",
  "27564": "Got any views on the subject?",

  "28353": "Do you understand this feeling?",
  "28354": "Where does that man live?",
  "28355": "Would you be willing to sell your inn?",
  "28356": "What do you want to do with him?",
  "28357": "Then you ARE going to be married, sir?",
  "28358": "What means your ladyship?",
  "28359": "What, then, is a race?",
  "28360": "To whom does it belong?",
  "28361": "But why is this man absent?",
  "28362": "What sundial?",
  "28363": "A fine room, is it not?",
  "28364": "Do I?",
  "28365": "If there is no love, what is there?",
  "28366": "Will you kiss me on it then?",
  "28367": "What do you think is the point his negotiations put most forward?",
  "28368": "And then what do you do?",
  "28369": "Is being in love conspiring?",
  "28370": "What do you think he will do?",
  "28371": "Yes or no?",
  "28372": "Do you not see these men still fear you, go in dread of you?",
  "28373": "What do you here on my land?",
  "28374": "Do you care for taters?",
  "28375": "Have you loved many women before me?",
  "28376": "Can you reconstruct the real face from them?",
  "28377": "Shall I?",
  "28378": "Can you ask it?",
  "28379": "Is he a farmer?",
  "28380": "No, how could she?",
  "28381": "Will you forget me?",
  "28382": "Are little things more subtle than big things?",
  "28383": "In what part of the house?",
  "28384": "My purse?",
  "28385": "What could I do but bow acceptance?",
  "28386": "Is there anyone with her?",
  "28387": "Replied I, what can I say?",
  "28388": "And your tongue does not refuse to utter this, and your heart does not shrink with shame while you do it?",
  "28389": "What am I to do myself?",
  "28390": "What does it strike you is the inference?",
  "28391": "On your honor is that true?",
  "28392": "And did he go home?",
  "28393": "But, comte tell me a reason for it?",
  "28394": "What objection could be made to him?",
  "28395": "Brought you down from whar?",
  "28396": "Why so, my dear child?",
  "28397": "What was he to say to her?",
  "28398": "And where are you going?",
  "28399": "What is yours?",
  "28400": "And what devil made me go to that wat?",
  "28401": "You tell me he burned the letter?",
  "28402": "And you have corresponded with her all this while?",
  "28403": "What brought it to pass?",
  "28404": "Why sit we not?",
  "28405": "What do you bewail, then, and why do you weep?",
  "28406": "Do you know what's going to become of YOU?",
  "28407": "Why, why' have I made this evening such a point of our not all dining together?",
  "28408": "Falling?",
  "28409": "Was he going to rebuild?",
  "28410": "What could he be dreaming of?",
  "28411": "Have you heard if he was much hurt?",
  "28412": "And how so?",
  "28413": "What do I make of it?",
  "28414": "All that tempest, all that cloud, that war, then that peace?",
  "28415": "But what motive had they in advising, from which so great a disaster was the result?",
  "28416": "What is the news?",
  "28417": "Well, then, what does the rest of 'em do?",
  "28418": "How else do you think I could educate them at all?",
  "28419": "How far is it now to the inn?",
  "28420": "Why do you feel so bad about that affair of this morning?",
  "28421": "Do you know the relief that my disappearance will be?",
  "28422": "Do you think so now?",
  "28423": "Or will he be carried away by the stream?",
  "28424": "Have you forgotten that when you were in trouble I did everything for you?",
  "28425": "But what is it, then, that I am accused of?",
  "28426": "Have you ever really loved anybody?",
  "28427": "Or that night, when I frowned at him?",
  "28428": "With the prince still?",
  "28429": "And a young lover come and carried off the bride, eh?",
  "28430": "If a man had stolen a pound in his youth and had used that pound to amass a huge fortune how much was he obliged to give back, the pound he had stolen only or the pound together with the compound interest accruing upon it or all his huge fortune?",
  "28431": "Do you recognize that, miss?",
  "28432": "Had not all the other places refused her because she did not know something or other?",
  "28433": "What could be the trouble?",
  "28434": "Sparsit, ma'am?",
  "28435": "Oh, is that it?",
  "28436": "Well, then, how is it that your eminence complained just now of want of information?",
  "28437": "What would they say, who made so light of money, if they could know how I had scraped my halfpence together, for the purchase of my daily saveloy and beer, or my slices of pudding?",
  "28438": "Had he the right to compel this sacrifice, knowing, realizing, as he did, that his child had based all the happiness of her life on the career she was now voluntarily giving up for his sake?",
  "28439": "Here, on the verandah?",
  "28440": "And how could this be properly explained to the young lady in gentle terms?",
  "28441": "Do you think it's because I'm really bad and unregenerate?",
  "28442": "Are you not?",
  "28443": "Then how about our position?",
  "28444": "And will he not?",
  "28445": "What recompense can we present?",
  "28446": "The principle is the same, I think?",
  "28447": "What happens in so many cases?",
  "28448": "Then we must have known equality previously to the time when we first saw the material equals, and reflected that all these apparent equals strive to attain absolute equality, but fall short of it?",
  "28449": "And since then?",
  "28450": "And as to her face, could it inspire nothing but passion?",
  "28451": "What was it then, and how had it affected his fate?",
  "28452": "Manager to a diamond merchant, or some such thing, is he not?",
  "28453": "And he does forgive?",
  "28454": "When all that failed, he boldly accosted him, and asked him, whether he did not remember him?",
  "28455": "Or, whither he should go?",
  "28456": "But we shall see you at the musicale this afternoon, shall we not?",
  "28457": "Should possibilities be worse to bear than certainties?",
  "28458": "Has the post come in?",
  "28459": "And when is this to be consummated?",
  "28460": "And what did they say?",
  "28461": "Is there a single sentiment it does not condemn?",
  "28462": "What are you stopping for?",
  "28463": "Do you want to work?",
  "28464": "Why are we now in the mansions of the rich and great, my friends?",
  "28465": "Are there many more?",
  "28466": "You can stay some time?",
  "28467": "The other side of WHAT?",
  "28468": "And you swim?",
  "28469": "Was he commencing to suspect?",
  "28470": "And in like manner does the touch adequately perceive the qualities of thickness or thinness, or softness or hardness?",
  "28471": "When you came in at the gate and asked the watchman the way here, had you any one with you?",
  "28472": "Where did your instructions come from?",
  "28473": "Why, then, monseigneur does not know?",
  "28474": "But, gentlemen, why are you getting angry again?",
  "28475": "And now it is you who have brought them together again?",
  "28476": "Was there not a spirit in him which, silent as it was, burned on him like the fires of perdition?",
  "28477": "Hurt you?",
  "28478": "What visions, they asked, could one but read them, must lie behind the quiet, dreaming eyes of that inscrutable face?",
  "28479": "What resources could they expect to find upon that scene of desolation?",
  "28480": "May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?",
  "28481": "Are you reconciled?",
  "28482": "Are you nothing?",
  "28483": "But what could have frightened the creatures so, and driven them from their haunts, when they ought to have been quietly sleeping?",
  "28484": "Or would you include the mixed?",
  "28485": "Was it a screw or thrust?",
  "28486": "Ah, then, is THAT what you've stayed over for?",
  "28487": "Do you know that he's the honestest and faithfullest fellow that ever lived, and that he has an irreproachable good name?",
  "28488": "What do you think of it, now?",
  "28489": "Why not?",
  "28490": "Always busy at what?",
  "28491": "How is it possible for him to be attained to?",
  "28492": "Is it finished?",
  "28493": "What do you mean?",
  "28494": "Do you hesitate?",
  "28495": "Is there any one in the lobby?",
  "28496": "I like the baron, but what better gifts can marriage bestow, than I already possess?",
  "28497": "Is not that saying illustrated by this?",
  "28498": "What's he?",
  "28499": "Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?",
  "28500": "Silver?",
  "28501": "Are we going to continue this pace all night?",
  "28502": "Can I be so lucky as to find what everybody is seeking for?",
  "28503": "Face?",
  "28504": "What else have you done?",
  "28505": "It stung you up a bit when I spoke of your game leg, young fellow?",
  "28506": "Sire, will you allow me to speak frankly as befits a loyal soldier?",
  "28507": "Then why speak to me about it?",
  "28508": "What the devil do I do?",
  "28509": "Who would ever know?",
  "28510": "Was I very gleeful, settled, content, during the hours I passed in yonder bare, humble schoolroom this morning and afternoon?",
  "28511": "Who will shrive the poor wretch, if you have come away from him?",
  "28512": "Why should I do so?",
  "28513": "And then she could not help remembering that he had passed some time with her under like circumstances, so why should there be any unfitness in the fact?",
  "28514": "Is there no mistake?",
  "28515": "Must he not have the qualities of a sage?",
  "28516": "Why is the sycophant thus added to the hypocrite, and the man who pretends to govern, sunk into the humble and submissive memorialist?",
  "28517": "Well, have we attained our end there also?",
  "28518": "From the dry rock who bade the waters flow?",
  "28519": "Do you observe that we were not far wrong in our guess that temperance was a sort of harmony?",
  "28520": "Whatever her sins, they were not sins of intention, but of inadvertence, and why should she have been punished so persistently?",
  "28521": "What was the bargain?",
  "28522": "And his dog also?",
  "28523": "Must I call you a liar as well as a thief?",
  "28524": "Why did you bring me here?",
  "28525": "If he could not speak, how was she to do so?",
  "28526": "And he will accomplish the trip?",
  "28527": "Is he mad?",
  "28528": "What is she there for?",
  "28529": "YOU insulted ME?",
  "28530": "And now, matey, did that doctor say how long I was to lie here in this old berth?",
  "28531": "My companion?",
  "28532": "For how can one?",
  "28533": "Game for a morning drive?",
  "28534": "You know where you left the team?",
  "28535": "How much have you lost?",
  "28536": "The boy's name?",
  "28537": "Why do you want to start on that again?",
  "28538": "And you yourself, what do you think about it?",
  "28539": "Why do you say I do not regard it?",
  "28540": "Must we, then, give up to despair?",
  "28541": "But where the devil are you?",
  "28542": "Living?",
  "28543": "Do you know what you have said?",
  "28544": "Well, and what has she been doing?",
  "28545": "Shall we not spend our immortal life together?",
  "28546": "Would this political deterrence prove acceptable to allies and to our own public?",
  "28547": "Should not all they be called mercenary who are always seeking consolations?",
  "28548": "Where is it, then?",
  "28549": "Do you really mean that?",
  "28550": "How could you get across?",
  "28551": "Can I take her into the spare room to lay off her hat when she comes?",
  "28552": "In case of doubt, shall it award the property to the first occupant?",
  "28553": "And the sago?",
  "28554": "You have not wanted for anything, vicomte, in my absence, have you?",
  "28555": "Who knows the will of heaven?",
  "28556": "What's that?",
  "28557": "Who's the object of your meditation, sir?",
  "28558": "Would you not say that he is entirely concerned with the soul and not with the body?",
  "28559": "Have we not?",
  "28560": "What does she think herself about him?",
  "28561": "Do you hate me so much as all that?",
  "28562": "Is not this to be rich?",
  "28563": "Should you like to retire at once?",
  "28564": "Will you ever go back?",
  "28565": "Why conceal your real feelings?",
  "28566": "In a hospital?",
  "28567": "Have you no information as to his abiding place?",
  "28568": "What is come of the troops that were encamped beside my palace?",
  "28569": "What's your names?",
  "28570": "For what reason is all this fume and fury?",
  "28571": "Of the painter we say that he will paint reins, and he will paint a bit?",
  "28572": "Will you ride on a few paces with the princess?",
  "28573": "Can you wash your own hands, or shall I wash them for you?",
  "28574": "And when shall we have the honor of seeing you again, your excellency?",
  "28575": "Are you interested in the sugar question?",
  "28576": "And they will go in three days now?",
  "28577": "But what good could he have done if he had?",
  "28578": "And what probability was there that a mere drudge would be able to manage a large and stormy assembly, abounding with able and experienced men?",
  "28579": "Gave him leave?",
  "28580": "You have, then, overheard our conversation?",
  "28581": "Will they sacrifice opportunity for the distressed, the beauty of our land, the hope of our poor?",
  "28582": "Esther, will you forgive me?",
  "28583": "Was this not preventing any inquiry, and, at the same time, assuming a higher ground through this pretended fascination exercised over a man who must have been of warlike nature and accustomed to receive homage?",
  "28584": "For what end are her fair complexities, her changes of soil, her sinuous coast?",
  "28585": "What was to be done with them?",
  "28586": "What must I know?",
  "28587": "Is it good?",
  "28588": "Would you four stand up for a moment?",
  "28589": "Is it not on this order of release?",
  "28590": "And, still further, I am tempted to inquire what has become of the indigent scholars, the sons of the masses of the people whose daily labour just suffices to meet their daily wants, for whose benefit these rich foundations were largely, if not mainly, instituted?",
  "28591": "There is nothing in my house for you, do you hear?",
  "28592": "On what ground shall we persuade the contented egoist, who has but a handful of commonplace desires and finds it possible to satisfy most of them, that it is better to call into being a multitude of wants many of which will probably remain unrealized?",
  "28593": "Do you hear now?",
  "28594": "What fog?",
  "28595": "Who was there present?",
  "28596": "What interest, I say, what interest do you ask?",
  "28597": "Not sick, are you?",
  "28598": "But what if I were mistaken?",
  "28599": "Then do you yourself know?",
  "28600": "Why should you, of all people, be so passionate about it?",
  "28601": "Would YOU like cats if you were me?",
  "28602": "Fifty cents a pound, was it?",
  "28603": "Do you acknowledge your faults?",
  "28604": "How can its error, being universal, be capable of correction?",
  "28605": "What had fate in store for these daring adventurers?",
  "28606": "Who do these three cavaliers appear to you to be?",
  "28607": "How did you know?",
  "28608": "And how could I do that, unless so be I was there myself?",
  "28609": "Are you still intimate with her?",
  "28610": "Or I my brains?",
  "28611": "Has anyone assaulted you?",
  "28612": "Whose?",
  "28613": "Is it in vain our conquering arms subdue?",
  "28614": "That idea is your own, and yours solely?",
  "28615": "Why have you never told me?",
  "28616": "Where are you going now?",
  "28617": "You will not say it?",
  "28618": "What are we going to do?",
  "28619": "How about these papers?",
  "28620": "Will nobody say what is the matter?",
  "28621": "But why should I repine?",
  "28622": "I must be trembling, does it not show in my writing?",
  "28623": "How had it come to pass that matters which with others are so private, should with her have become the public property of so large a circle?",
  "28624": "Where is the man who can say the fault, in part, has not been his?",
  "28625": "You would allow, I said, that there is in nature an upper and lower and middle region?",
  "28626": "Well, and what do you think?",
  "28627": "Have we lost the power of rendering you happy?",
  "28628": "Why not, sire?",
  "28629": "Are you sure that you do not falter or fear?",
  "28630": "And what can we do there?",
  "28631": "Want money?",
  "28632": "You're not going to be silly about it, are you?",
  "28633": "And have you ever seen her by any chance?",
  "28634": "You have heard nothing to the contrary, have you?",
  "28635": "Did you find him, gossip?",
  "28636": "Is it all over?",
  "28637": "What's that, sir?",
  "28638": "That you fled from your husband?",
  "28639": "Remember where he said the book was?",
  "28640": "And now, when shall we meet again?",
  "28641": "Did I say anything that was inconsistent with his having seen it before?",
  "28642": "Iron what?",
  "28643": "Can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than laws can among friends?",
  "28644": "Why contend?",
  "28645": "But may not this inference be presumptuous?",
  "28646": "What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant?",
  "28647": "And how have you wriggled onto the staff?",
  "28648": "Counting from when?",
  "28649": "What's the matter, then?",
  "28650": "Does he know you are going to be married?",
  "28651": "Are they not lovely?",
  "28652": "What would you do, then?",
  "28653": "You remember, I was proclaimed four years ago?",
  "28654": "I suppose you'd be above sittin' down and 'avin' a bit of dinner with us?",
  "28655": "Was he bent, then, upon ruining me?",
  "28656": "Why scare people?",
  "28657": "Where am I to let you know to?",
  "28658": "Any fault there?",
  "28659": "Where did you get that donkey head?",
  "28660": "Was anybody here just now?",
  "28661": "From whom and what about?",
  "28662": "Barkis?",
  "28663": "Who would these be?",
  "28664": "Of her character?",
  "28665": "Like my father?",
  "28666": "Yes, and why did you go in?",
  "28667": "In which world?",
  "28668": "You have arms, I suppose?",
  "28669": "Where are you bound for?",
  "28670": "And of what kind of trees?",
  "28671": "Going to college, I suppose?",
  "28672": "What's gone of your father and your mother, eh?",
  "28673": "Do you suppose they'll ever dance together?",
  "28674": "Do they imagine at home that I am so inexpert in the theory of drama as not to know this?",
  "28675": "What did you cut it off for, then?",
  "28676": "Johnson?",
  "28677": "What good is it then for the ball to be thrown up, or harm for it to come down, or even to have fallen?",
  "28678": "But would it be so?",
  "28679": "Do you play much?",
  "28680": "How do you know it is not too late?",
  "28681": "Do you know what my great grandfather's name was?",
  "28682": "Can man breathe this polluted air and live?",
  "28683": "WHY DIED I NOT FROM THE WOMB?",
  "28684": "What else could it be that made me pass such a terrible night?",
  "28685": "Is he in the house now?",
  "28686": "Have you nothing to add?",
  "28687": "Does the straw bother you, mate?",
  "28688": "My footprint, I presume?",
  "28689": "Would you like it again?",
  "28690": "Where is he going?",
  "28691": "And what did you do in the matter, bishop?",
  "28692": "Give me what you took from me, will you?",
  "28693": "Are you going to marry him?",
  "28694": "But she's got her faults, you mean to say?",
  "28695": "Is he a good workman?",
  "28696": "Who might have done that, I wonder?",
  "28697": "How long do you remain here, prince?",
  "28698": "But did you never win?",
  "28699": "Since I've been away?",
  "28700": "Ruined?",
  "28701": "Is the law of universal gravitation the law of universal nonsense?",
  "28702": "Will you give a man with this much information a vote?",

  "28707": "Do you see anything else?",
  "28708": "How could I after all the fuss?",
  "28709": "Perhaps it was not quite wise of you to come home?",

  "28723": "How shall I ever bring round to my adventurous views those whom I propose to desert?",
  "28724": "Did I have a father and mother?",

  "29175": "And what did he find?",
  "29176": "Is it sure promised?",
  "29177": "What is the trial for, when he is not here and will never return?",
  "29178": "What a shameful disorder in nature, is it not, to make war against women?",
  "29179": "Whereabouts will she be?",
  "29180": "Am I not your comrade?",

  "29396": "Oh, my king, say yourself, did I not owe it to this poor girl to try everything in order to save her?",
  "29397": "What could I become with these surroundings?",
  "29398": "May I see?",
  "29399": "And why was that, do you suppose?",
  "29400": "Have you anything to ask this witness, boy?",

  "29676": "How did he do?",
  "29677": "What's your lay?",
  "29678": "Who at this court is so audacious as to wish to injure those whom the queen loves?",
  "29679": "Merciful heavens?",
  "29680": "Have you only just come?",
  "29681": "Over there, do you see, where the pools are?",
  "29682": "Let me ask you why you deceived me?",
  "29683": "Shall you keep it or send it back?",
  "29684": "To what do you refer?",
  "29685": "If there be no life in earth, how could life come out of it?",
  "29686": "Is the money, then, ready?",

  "29690": "Would he not one day make you pay for keeping this terrible secret?",
  "29691": "Will there ever be an end to these fooleries?",
  "29692": "But, then, why should he smile so kindly upon you?",
  "29693": "What misfortune?",
  "29694": "How could I wish to make anything hard to you either by my words or conduct?",
  "29695": "What was the meaning of this?",
  "29696": "Would he never come back?",
  "29697": "Are you staying at the flat?",
  "29698": "How could I be expected to know?",
  "29699": "Have you chased them away, too?",
  "29700": "Is he one of your men?",
  "29701": "Everything?",
  "29702": "What have you been doing?",
  "29703": "After all, what could it matter to her whether he were here or there, on this ship or another, ashore or not?",
  "29704": "Are you not near me?",
  "29705": "It is not your business, is it?",
  "29706": "In three days?",
  "29707": "Well then, do you think I am awake?",
  "29708": "Is she ill, or only famished?",
  "29709": "Have you any more notions?",
  "29710": "You are not well?",
  "29711": "Cohan?",
  "29712": "Has he committed a sin?",
  "29713": "Do you want to see it?",
  "29714": "You are still with us, I presume?",
  "29715": "And where is he gone to?",
  "29716": "What means had been employed to kidnap this innocent creature, and with what object?",
  "29717": "How can I hope to save her?",
  "29718": "What is't you do?",
  "29719": "What was?",
  "29720": "Well, will you go?",
  "29721": "And your grandparents?",
  "29722": "What, that child?",
  "29723": "I suppose you would hardly know me again now I've got a pair of whiskers?",
  "29724": "Your wife?",
  "29725": "If he be ever so improper, how can I help his having written to me?",
  "29726": "What jars to our preconceptions will he and I receive here?",
  "29727": "How could there be any good in a woman that everybody spoke ill of?",
  "29728": "What call shall I send?",
  "29729": "How do you name yourself?",
  "29730": "Did you understand that sign?",
  "29731": "Will you come in?",
  "29732": "Cost?",
  "29733": "Why, man, what are you talking about?",
  "29734": "But do you know where?",
  "29735": "Was it because she was bareheaded, was it merely her natural expression?",
  "29736": "Have you shadowed her?",
  "29737": "Will you come back?",
  "29738": "And what else can he be after?",
  "29739": "Then how do you come to be going there?",
  "29740": "Well, if war is a terrible thing, what about patriotism, which is the idea at the base of it?",
  "29741": "Does it please your honor that I should accompany you?",
  "29742": "Why, is not here your cloak?",
  "29743": "Are all the cranes and pulleys sure?",
  "29744": "She is in prison?",
  "29745": "But there is nothing comforting in having your hair cut off because you've dyed it a dreadful color, is there?",
  "29746": "It is not like her, you say?",
  "29747": "And who is he?",
  "29748": "What letter is it?",
  "29749": "And you, what the devil do you want here?",
  "29750": "Suppose we have a little game of euchre?",
  "29751": "What does it all mean?",
  "29752": "But when you leave him, for instance?",
  "29753": "Only slightly touched?",
  "29754": "Was it for so petty a thing that he had done all that he had done?",
  "29755": "Perhaps this incident was connected with that of the bullet?",
  "29756": "Conway, what are you going to do?",
  "29757": "Are limes the fashion now?",
  "29758": "Rebecca, may I give you a wing?",
  "29759": "What were the defects of this remarkable man?",
  "29760": "But how were we to get him into his clothes again?",
  "29761": "I hope I was not the trouble, guardian?",
  "29762": "Where is beauty?",
  "29763": "Where has he gone?",
  "29764": "Well, then, how if we were to begin with oysters, and so change the whole program?",
  "29765": "The face he pulled?",
  "29766": "Can they govern a family, or take care of the poor babes whom they bring into the world?",
  "29767": "Is it, then, stretching our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the occasion of the change?",
  "29768": "Neither gold nor rank?",
  "29769": "But was he alone or accompanied?",
  "29770": "WHY, you dear delightful woman, did you like it?",
  "29771": "Who is knocking?",
  "29772": "How can you speak of it in that way?",
  "29773": "Do you mean that we are going to die too?",
  "29774": "Why not stay here now and be quiet?",
  "29775": "You have since reflected?",
  "29776": "Do you think your hotel man will open his hotel this month?",
  "29777": "Is that all, gentlemen?",
  "29778": "Why should you be inconvenienced?",
  "29779": "Thed what are you?",
  "29780": "Did anyone ever hear the like?",
  "29781": "Is there too much vanity in what I have just said?",
  "29782": "What is that?",
  "29783": "You would not marry him, now that he is free?",
  "29784": "And the unjust is good and wise, and the just is neither?",
  "29785": "Who wrote it?",
  "29786": "Now, was that somebody brother to the prisoner at the bar?",
  "29787": "Well, does the colonel treat you well?",
  "29788": "How long are we to endure it?",
  "29789": "What is it that I manage?",
  "29790": "Quite so, but it seems rather an absurd blind, does it not?",
  "29791": "You made paper, pens and ink?",
  "29792": "But why talk now?",
  "29793": "Is it a renewal of the former proposition or what?",
  "29794": "But what to do?",
  "29795": "Shall we charge them or no?",
  "29796": "Why should I tire you with particulars of my consequence?",
  "29797": "Then why do you apply to me?",
  "29798": "And have they appointed the matron?",
  "29799": "And why not?",
  "29800": "Has a girl of fourteen a heart large enough, vigorous enough, to hold the swelling spring of pure, full, fervid eloquence?",
  "29801": "I understand you to say that there are three students who use this stair, and are in the habit of passing your door?",
  "29802": "Our neighbor?",
  "29803": "Where would they meet?",
  "29804": "How was it I noticed nothing?",
  "29805": "Where are you going, bandit?",
  "29806": "You do not doubt his affection?",
  "29807": "What orders?",
  "29808": "Can you walk?",
  "29809": "If he had been positively in earnest, with downright manly earnestness, would he have allowed the thing to drag itself with a weak uncertain life, as it had done for the last two or three years?",
  "29810": "Even allowing that she does not love him, that she pays no heed to her vows and promises, how can she give herself to another man?",
  "29811": "Who gave her away?",
  "29812": "To what had he brought himself?",
  "29813": "What can be done for it?",
  "29814": "Is everything as it should be?",
  "29815": "I trust he does not suffer?",
  "29816": "How do you mean, the general?",
  "29817": "And how many hours a day did you do lessons?",
  "29818": "Is it a very wicked place?",
  "29819": "Why had our incomprehensible guide led us to the bottom of this submarine crypt?",
  "29820": "What are you doing tonight?",
  "29821": "Will you take me away with you?",
  "29822": "I hope we are not to part as enemies?",
  "29823": "Ah, dear sister, how can I answer this question?",
  "29824": "Why will you think so?",
  "29825": "What could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as it dropped on her work?",
  "29826": "Do you mean me, sir?",
  "29827": "Did he not pretend to go back to his tribe, who had treated him ill, and driven him from their wigwams like a dog?",
  "29828": "But how can we find the way in this fog?",
  "29829": "In a decadent society, to come nearer to the problems which concern us in ethics, must a man strive to realize the social will expressed in progressive decadence?",
  "29830": "Had he noticed that the days had been only six hours long, and that the weight of the atmosphere was so much diminished?",
  "29831": "What was the man doing when you saw him?",
  "29832": "What does all this knowing mean to me?",
  "29833": "Might not that person by patient waiting be covering silent preparation, and proving his fitness for the glorious task before him?",
  "29834": "But what if it's worse than this?",
  "29835": "Not HE?",
  "29836": "Do I try and catch them?",
  "29837": "Still inquisitive?",
  "29838": "Is it my fault if fortune, which has frowned on you, has been kind to me?",
  "29839": "You haf not got something to drink, hey?",
  "29840": "Yes, dear?",
  "29841": "Art shod with lead?",
  "29842": "Wherein have I hurt you?",
  "29843": "Will our help come from you?",
  "29844": "How should there be eighteen copies, all different from the original, and from one another, in minor matters?",
  "29845": "In the meantime, who can foretell what would be the sufferings and privations of the people during its existence?",
  "29846": "What is it, grandmother?",
  "29847": "If we could get a drink?",
  "29848": "Is it not the duty of the nations to combine and to relieve suffering humanity?",
  "29849": "Then that is not the knowledge which we are seeking to discover?",
  "29850": "You met a monk, did you not?",
  "29851": "Can I not read your heart?",
  "29852": "Now, then, the difference between property and possession being well established, and it being settled that the former, for the reasons which I have just given, must necessarily disappear, is it best, for the slight advantage of restoring an etymology, to retain the word PROPERTY?",
  "29853": "What, it seems I do not drink but by an attorney?",
  "29854": "What was the cause of this flaw?",
  "29855": "Shall I give her?",
  "29856": "Was it right to be frightened already?",
  "29857": "At what hour would you wish the ceremony performed?",
  "29858": "Do you mean a compliment?",
  "29859": "Do you not know that there is a spirit within you different from flesh?",
  "29860": "In this painful moment can the best of fathers wish to destroy my domestic happiness, the only kind which now remains to me?",
  "29861": "What struggle was going on within him?",
  "29862": "So that he still expects his money?",
  "29863": "What will become of us if she dies, as I always fear when her face is like that?",
  "29864": "And if not, is he a devil?",
  "29865": "You your command, and I my title?",
  "29866": "Why has she not written to me, then?",
  "29867": "By this train?",
  "29868": "Are they good to eat?",
  "29869": "Will we trample again upon that torn and mangled corpse?",
  "29870": "And who can wonder if it be so, mother?",
  "29871": "Are you comfortable now, sir?",
  "29872": "Swear it was not true?",
  "29873": "What good was moral support in providing a million and a half?",
  "29874": "But can you restore him back to life?",
  "29875": "I hope you're well?",
  "29876": "Did he designedly conceal some incident of his captivity?",
  "29877": "You remember that young fellow mother wanted me to have?",
  "29878": "So there are fashions, nowadays, in illness, are there?",
  "29879": "Then, sir, you are a favourite, I find, among the ladies?",
  "29880": "Do he rave about his mother just the same, poor fellow?",
  "29881": "Where is it?",
  "29882": "Yours then are rather here?",
  "29883": "Are you in a position to quit the post of superintendent at this moment?",
  "29884": "Do you observe anything remarkable about that?",
  "29885": "How was this to be done?",
  "29886": "Have you never heard talk of a certain secret?",
  "29887": "Did he come here voluntarily?",
  "29888": "What do you really think of her?",
  "29889": "When did he give it you?",
  "29890": "Unintentionally?",
  "29891": "Harry?",
  "29892": "Am I to come home?",
  "29893": "Now if this tenderness for the dead is such an exercise of these three theological virtues, and if, again, even heroic sanctity consists principally in their exercise, what store ought we not to set upon this touching and beautiful devotion?",
  "29894": "And the result of the examination?",
  "29895": "His ELDER brother?",
  "29896": "Perhaps he was expected to utter certain words?",
  "29897": "Supposing he is loyal, can any of his requests be granted, and if any, which of them?",
  "29898": "Are you sure you are more reasonable?",
  "29899": "Shall I go in first?",
  "29900": "What will you warm yourself with this winter?",

  "29920": "We sent you wine?",
  "29921": "When did you get the letter?",
  "29922": "What is indispensable to you?",
  "29923": "What have I said?",
  "29924": "But how could you be sure I would know it?",
  "29925": "Tell me, I entreat of you, who and what you are?",
  "29926": "Had he not seduced his sisters, one after the other?",
  "29927": "Might I speak to you with regard to that matter of his grace, sir?",
  "29928": "Must I close this?",
  "29929": "The world is surely not worth living in now, is it?",
  "29930": "And was this the man?",
  "29931": "What's the time?",
  "29932": "What's queer?",
  "29933": "What house will they take?",
  "29934": "May the man who denies it rest his assertion upon such general considerations as that satisfaction presupposes desire, and that desire implies a lack, and, hence, pain?",
  "29935": "Was it well?",
  "29936": "Could it be done?",
  "29937": "Why should I stand in a comrade's way?",
  "29938": "What have you done with that gentleman against whom you had the audacity, about twelve days ago, to make an accusation of passing false money?",
  "29939": "What else should I stay on for?",
  "29940": "What beings surround me?",
  "29941": "What judgment?",
  "29942": "How could I offend a man who was charitable enough to sit at my bedside a good hour, and talk on some other subject than pills and draughts, blisters and leeches?",
  "29943": "D'Epinay?",
  "29944": "Are you certain of what you say, monsieur?",
  "29945": "And the reason is that each part of him is doing its own business, whether in ruling or being ruled?",
  "29946": "You want it, I expect?",
  "29947": "Had he been fooled once more?",
  "29948": "Do you seriously believe that that machine has travelled into time?",
  "29949": "What says our graver sister?",
  "29950": "But when these different reflections and observations concur in establishing the same conclusion, must they not bestow an undisputed evidence upon it?",
  "29951": "Can I do anything?",
  "29952": "What passage is that?",
  "29953": "But does she now dissolve the union?",
  "29954": "Any way out of that yard, now?",
  "29955": "Have those who have had their share in oligarchies been peculiarly wise and peculiarly devoted to the common good?",
  "29956": "What was there to be done in the village?",
  "29957": "What should I tell?",
  "29958": "Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad?",
  "29959": "To what purpose?",
  "29960": "And if it is labor that creates wealth and legitimates property, how explain the consumption of the idler?",
  "29961": "What did you mean by that?",
  "29962": "Well, what do YOU make of it?",
  "29963": "Are there any?",
  "29964": "And if I refuse to retract, you wish to fight, do you?",
  "29965": "Dora, what has happened to you?",
  "29966": "Where have you been sleeping all this week?",
  "29967": "But what do you gather from it?",
  "29968": "Then how could you know?",
  "29969": "Are you much hurt?",
  "29970": "Daunted?",
  "29971": "And why should you try to deceive me by telling a tale?",
  "29972": "Can I come, with my doll?",
  "29973": "Yes my boy?",
  "29974": "Had it not been for this utter stranger, they had succeeded, for who would have accepted my unsupported word against the damning evidence of those cards hidden on my person?",
  "29975": "Why this man saved and that man lost?",
  "29976": "How has my judgment wander'd?",
  "29977": "And is not all true virtue the companion of wisdom, no matter what fears or pleasures or other similar goods or evils may or may not attend her?",
  "29978": "You know what I mean?",
  "29979": "What, sweetheart?",
  "29980": "What sort of a place is it?",
  "29981": "Well, I vow, that's what the sea folks call sailing UNDER BARE POLES, come true, aint it?",
  "29982": "Who took his hands out of mine?",
  "29983": "I insist upon your living, do you hear?",
  "29984": "Why on earth did you ask him to dine with us?",
  "29985": "Was she sheering off?",
  "29986": "What say your old men?",
  "29987": "Are not the quail, the pigeon and the partridge the natural prey of the hawk?",
  "29988": "From the country, I see, sir?",
  "29989": "Would prudence or gratitude allow the pontiffs to renounce their benefactor?",
  "29990": "Why must their ruffs be always crinkled like endive leaves, and not crimped with a crimping iron?",
  "29991": "To whom is it they should have recourse?",
  "29992": "But who is there that ever heard of such an instinct?",
  "29993": "Well, but what am I to do?",
  "29994": "Subdivide?",
  "29995": "What is the colour of the men?",
  "29996": "What's the pay?",
  "29997": "Because I sigh when thinking of some one I am leaving?",
  "29998": "Whom did you play with?",
  "29999": "Do they work worse?",
  "30000": "You're not worried about anything?",
  "30001": "Are you sure you know the way?",
  "30002": "Why not make him a doctor like his father?",
  "30003": "But what was that to her, or to any one but myself?",
  "30004": "A little fancy work?",
  "30005": "Then again, if a woman and her lover conspire to murder a husband, are they going to advertise their guilt by ostentatiously removing his wedding ring after his death?",
  "30006": "Where are you off to?",
  "30007": "What's set you a snivelling now?",
  "30008": "And who is to do the parish work?",
  "30009": "Are you well fed?",
  "30010": "How many years do you mean to live after I am gone?",
  "30011": "What could these people do?",
  "30012": "Do you think I would leave you?",
  "30013": "And what do you call all this?",
  "30014": "Is it anything bad?",
  "30015": "Is it of course?",
  "30016": "But now what?",
  "30017": "Where is it?",
  "30018": "Would these two travellers make much difference to the horses, if we took them with us?",
  "30019": "Shall we not bear the trials of life a little longer in patience?",
  "30020": "How can they recognize you, if you act in such a manner that no one can recognize you?",
  "30021": "What is it you smell of?",
  "30022": "Forgotten, indeed?",
  "30023": "Were you at the performance last evening?",
  "30024": "How have you got on?",
  "30025": "Paying the money, I suppose?",
  "30026": "May one venture to ask you, monsieur, on what you have reflected?",
  "30027": "Are you, then, a coward?",
  "30028": "Would it not be safer and more certain if I should ask him his name and tell him yours?",
  "30029": "Why, how did he come here, mother?",
  "30030": "Why do you say that, when you are going to this terrible war, and he is so old?",
  "30031": "Under what law, and for what offence?",
  "30032": "Easily?",
  "30033": "Why did he not take her in his arms and swear that he would never leave her?",
  "30034": "DID you hear that?",
  "30035": "Is the committee willing to hear this witness?",
  "30036": "Would you care for it?",
  "30037": "Who will be waiting for me beyond the ditch?",
  "30038": "May I?",
  "30039": "What is the stone called?",
  "30040": "Now, sir, tell me who and what that woman was?",
  "30041": "Are you one?",
  "30042": "Married?",
  "30043": "Will that do now?",
  "30044": "How shall I put it on?",
  "30045": "And to what purpose?",
  "30046": "Mouston?",
  "30047": "How is your dear mother getting on?",
  "30048": "Why did we choose it, this foolish task?",
  "30049": "Are you an alienist?",
  "30050": "Cannot ate it?",
  "30051": "You are, I imagine, still of the same opinion?",
  "30052": "Or not you so much, perhaps, as your friend in the city?",
  "30053": "Did you ask her how much?",
  "30054": "Is there no force on this side of the creek?",
  "30055": "If I guess rightly, will you confess it?",
  "30056": "Did you ever hear a definition of fame, sir?",
  "30057": "Ay, but how shall we know the catchpole?",
  "30058": "What harm is there in that?",
  "30059": "Why are there men and women that while they are nigh me the sunlight expands my blood?",
  "30060": "Why, according to popular belief is it rather characterised by the very contrary?",
  "30061": "Shall we hold it as a province and govern it by despotic power?",
  "30062": "My dear doctor, what is my wife's complaint?",
  "30063": "Do we go all the way today?",
  "30064": "Oh, what does that matter?",
  "30065": "What place was there in her mind for a remonstrance to lodge in?",
  "30066": "Really and truly?",
  "30067": "If that were so, what had become of my father?",
  "30068": "But where is the last year's snow?",
  "30069": "How much will you ask to stay with her till the end?",
  "30070": "Can the heart become misshapen and contract incurable deformities and infirmities under the oppression of a disproportionate unhappiness, as the vertebral column beneath too low a vault?",
  "30071": "What can it be?",
  "30072": "Of whom are you jealous, now?",
  "30073": "What was the sense of that?",
  "30074": "I felt very ignorant, but what could I do?",
  "30075": "And what are you going to do with yourself now, if I may ask?",
  "30076": "What interest of hers was affected by the treaty?",
  "30077": "An order to who?",
  "30078": "Which is the stronger, the small stick that first PRODUCES the fire, or the fire itself?",
  "30079": "So you've been at the club?",
  "30080": "Has he been a good soldier except the desertion?",
  "30081": "Do you think not?",
  "30082": "What you mought call me?",
  "30083": "Full of hope?",
  "30084": "And who will go?",
  "30085": "Farther?",
  "30086": "Should he slip away after having come and peeped into the barricade?",
  "30087": "Perhaps?",
  "30088": "Very well, my dear sir, and how does that concern us?",
  "30089": "But will the wild ass submit to the bonds?",
  "30090": "Where is the count?",
  "30091": "A whole one, and in a candlestick?",
  "30092": "Are you?",
  "30093": "Are you going to remain as you are, dear princess?",
  "30094": "What might have been your opinion of the place?",
  "30095": "Who defeated it?",
  "30096": "Plantation hand?",
  "30097": "For us, also?",
  "30098": "What is to be done with them?",
  "30099": "What would the life of a man be if he could feel no fear or repulsion?",
  "30100": "Is it really so that I may understand you, sir?",
  "30101": "Well, dad, what do you say about it?",
  "30102": "Why did she love everything so tenderly and so passionately, everything living that was not a man?",
  "30103": "In favor of some member of your family?",
  "30104": "You are angry, monsieur?",
  "30105": "What, he told you so, I suppose?",
  "30106": "What, have they buried him in honour for his services to them?",
  "30107": "To stand from fear set free?",
  "30108": "You are aware, I suppose, that all mythology and poetry is a narration of events, either past, present, or to come?",
  "30109": "Why do you go, sir?",
  "30110": "You called my father 'Michael' as if you knew him well?",
  "30111": "This DETOUR has been entirely for our benefit, then?",
  "30112": "What do you tell me?",
  "30113": "What was she like now?",
  "30114": "Call the captain, and heave the ship aback?",
  "30115": "And did you observe any change in her then?",
  "30116": "Flee alone, and leave you here?",
  "30117": "Can I have lost it?",
  "30118": "Are the sacrifices I have made of honour and modesty to you no proof of my being tied to you in bonds too strong to be broken?",
  "30119": "But what makes you so much out of sorts?",
  "30120": "Why, wherefore stay you?",
  "30121": "Who asked him while I was away?",
  "30122": "Jarndyce?",
  "30123": "Why, what's the matter?",
  "30124": "What does it depend upon?",
  "30125": "Now will you learn not to answer back when I speak to you?",
  "30126": "And what you think of it?",
  "30127": "But, on the other hand, did not the people evince decided obstinacy and insubordination?",
  "30128": "And my making it easy for you to see the child?",
  "30129": "Has anyone an interest in preventing your arrival there?",
  "30130": "Do you abuse your teacher?",
  "30131": "Has it struck you that we may not now choose to give over?",
  "30132": "And how do you like the place?",
  "30133": "Why do you not sit by his side and begin talking to him and asking him questions?",
  "30134": "What have you got to be afraid of?",
  "30135": "What used he to say?",
  "30136": "Where the devil is mine?",
  "30137": "How do you feel yourself?",
  "30138": "That millions of others still exist, which are too minute for any observation?",
  "30139": "I suppose we might call her that?",
  "30140": "What's that to me?",
  "30141": "But you are sure you can act your part, and disguise your voice so that he may mistake that, as he has already mistaken your person?",
  "30142": "What would it matter if you smashed to smithereens at the end of the run, after a bust like that?",
  "30143": "Can someone have guessed our secret and dug up the watch?",
  "30144": "But what could he do but just let her see that he would make anything, everything, for her, as honourably easy as possible?",
  "30145": "How many cartridges did you say you had left?",
  "30146": "What then is worth being valued?",
  "30147": "What does this avail?",
  "30148": "This, then, was his father's residence?",
  "30149": "Fisher?",
  "30150": "How like you that answer?",
  "30151": "But what shall we do?",
  "30152": "If it is a friend, why does he not show himself?",
  "30153": "Who then must decide?",
  "30154": "Can we with propriety suffer them to be rulers?",
  "30155": "Have you been here long?",
  "30156": "How can they suit each other?",
  "30157": "Do you see these?",
  "30158": "How do you prove that?",
  "30159": "Arsenic?",
  "30160": "Now, sir, what have you to say to me?",
  "30161": "I suppose we're going to have a talk about this?",
  "30162": "Let 'em both wait?",
  "30163": "Perhaps you would not mind walking to town with me?",
  "30164": "Love had bandaged his eyes, in order to lead him whither?",
  "30165": "It is not my intention to detain the reader by expa?",
  "30166": "Why ask?",
  "30167": "Am I to read this?",
  "30168": "Who are you then?",
  "30169": "Was there nothing to fear?",
  "30170": "But did this man hope to conceal himself effectually behind that heap of rubbish, which one need but skirt?",
  "30171": "Then it all depends on that object that you regard, for your reasons, as evidence?",
  "30172": "What if there was no rank of life in which she could now properly attach herself?",
  "30173": "Why then do philosophers look for public spirit?",
  "30174": "How many would he have?",
  "30175": "But do you know this mysterious count is a bachelor?",
  "30176": "Why strive for a coherent, satisfied life?",
  "30177": "Intelligent you call yourselves, do you?",
  "30178": "Did men eat men?",
  "30179": "That is, he was not a boy at all, I suppose?",
  "30180": "Who knew what would have saved him?",
  "30181": "Could he not annul the verdict?",
  "30182": "How can something come out of nothing?",
  "30183": "And now, he said, what did we just now call that principle which repels the even?",
  "30184": "What is that error?",
  "30185": "I hurriedly made him a reply to the effect, that I hoped the error into which I had been betrayed by the desperate nature of my love, did not induce him to think me mercenary too?",
  "30186": "What is this place?",
  "30187": "Guy, is this amount of confidence to be our stock to start the new life on?",
  "30188": "How is your head, better?",
  "30189": "What matters that?",
  "30190": "The opportunity is a good one, then?",
  "30191": "But if, in spite of all my precautions, I am at last obliged to fight, will you not be my second?",
  "30192": "May I ask you to be so kind as to inquire of all your subjects if any of them have seen a fishing hook lost in the sea?",
  "30193": "And what is your business?",
  "30194": "Had I better wait till it's three o'clock?",
  "30195": "Why are you not eating anything, gentlemen?",
  "30196": "Does this not amount to your stealing the annual salary from your lord?",
  "30197": "Who'd you reckon?",
  "30198": "WILL IT BE COMMUNISM?",
  "30199": "Are you a married man, sir?",
  "30200": "What dream we of?",
  "30201": "What's the good of taking it in hand now?",
  "30202": "But if he does not come?",
  "30203": "Have you any idea what became of them?",
  "30204": "And why this ABSOLUTISM in the relations of capitalist and laborer?",
  "30205": "Is any man termed a gentleman, that is not always in the fashion?",
  "30206": "Do I ever leave you?",
  "30207": "Are you all of the same opinion?",
  "30208": "Whose was this mighty personality?",
  "30209": "Perhaps you could name the figures of a few wiolincellers of a good tone?",
  "30210": "To marrying whom?",
  "30211": "Am I wrong to come up here to see her?",
  "30212": "You heard my question?",
  "30213": "Why now should I be tempted?",
  "30214": "Where's my maid?",
  "30215": "You're able to read?",
  "30216": "What has he lived on since?",
  "30217": "And you resent it?",
  "30218": "Kennedy was preparing to discharge all his batteries into the middle of the ascending multitude, but what could he have done against such a numberless army?",
  "30219": "Was it not rather a service and a kindly act?",
  "30220": "How could there be when it's barely ten o'clock yet?",
  "30221": "And have you got a paper?",
  "30222": "Where is the girl who promised to marry any one who would release her brother?",
  "30223": "And all arithmetic and calculation have to do with number?",
  "30224": "How do you happen to be here?",
  "30225": "And what is the result?",
  "30226": "And for what have you ruined your life, if you come to think of it?",
  "30227": "Who talks of cadeaux?",
  "30228": "But did you not read that I must be alone?",
  "30229": "Do you find the prisoner guilty or not guilty?",
  "30230": "And he who does not possess and is therefore unable to impart this conception, in whatever degree he fails, may in that degree also be said to fail in intelligence?",
  "30231": "But what's happened to you?",
  "30232": "Are you lost or have the wolves eaten you?",
  "30233": "Yet why do tears blind my eyes?",
  "30234": "Why should I still be subject to these visitations of the devil, when I try so hard to keep him away?",
  "30235": "How do you know what I think?",
  "30236": "But why was the tear in her eye?",
  "30237": "Are you lonesome because you're a magician?",
  "30238": "What had taken place during those ten months?",
  "30239": "You accuse him, then?",
  "30240": "What has anybody to do with that?",
  "30241": "Was I wrong in claiming that confusion reigned among legists, and ought I to be legally prosecuted for having said that their science henceforth stood convicted of falsehood, its glory eclipsed?",
  "30242": "John, which way must we now turn?",
  "30243": "Was I not right?",
  "30244": "Why so breathless a start?",
  "30245": "And have we, at our age, been earnestly discoursing with one another all our life long only to discover that we are no better than children?",
  "30246": "Do you want to go with us?",
  "30247": "Who had taken the letters, if letters there were?",
  "30248": "At any rate, they are all reconciled to it now, I hope?",
  "30249": "And they will place them under the command of experienced veterans who will be their leaders and teachers?",
  "30250": "Even the spiritual vision, is it not at all points arrested by the continuous golden walls of the universe?",
  "30251": "What can you be dreaming of?",
  "30252": "You say again you are quite sure that it was the prisoner?",
  "30253": "Is it any new trouble?",
  "30254": "And talking about the hospital?",
  "30255": "Amid what elegancies of carved furniture, decorated walls, elaborate tapestries did they move?",
  "30256": "If they are really qualified for the task, will not their own hearts be the first to inform them of it?",
  "30257": "What sort of life were that to live?",
  "30258": "What's your trade?",
  "30259": "How could I have been so beguiled?",
  "30260": "How does I talk wild?",
  "30261": "Would we be done for?",
  "30262": "Come, now, my learned friend, what makes you hesitate?",
  "30263": "You have come far?",
  "30264": "But is she not awfully rich?",
  "30265": "Who can make good coffee?",
  "30266": "So we had better leave you?",
  "30267": "Is the downstairs door fast?",
  "30268": "Or if he is to be governed, how can he be governed well?",
  "30269": "Will you have tea here then, or go across to the house, where there's a tent on the lawn?",
  "30270": "Did you observe the colour?",
  "30271": "Can it be?",
  "30272": "Will this assist in explaining the difficulty?",
  "30273": "Is not my son hungry?",
  "30274": "You are sure of your enterprise?",
  "30275": "Have you been at the concert?",
  "30276": "What about her horse?",
  "30277": "Mamma, what am I to say to him?",
  "30278": "When is your turn to come?",
  "30279": "Had I thus come in vain into these forests and mountains?",
  "30280": "Do you call that nothing?",
  "30281": "What is it, then, which does judge about them?",
  "30282": "Shall I lend you a hand here?",
  "30283": "Damn you, what do you mean by that?",
  "30284": "And who's that tall chap standing beside her?",
  "30285": "Would any one deny this?",
  "30286": "Did they impose on each industry a proportional tax, so as to preserve a balance in the market?",
  "30287": "What should you do in my place?",
  "30288": "What more could one ask for?",
  "30289": "For who can change men's opinions?",
  "30290": "Would a painter be any the worse because, after having delineated with consummate art an ideal of a perfectly beautiful man, he was unable to show that any such man could ever have existed?",
  "30291": "Have you decided?",
  "30292": "How is your father getting on?",
  "30293": "Were those great, stony cliffs the gates of paradise?",
  "30294": "Shall our rivers and harbors be improved?",
  "30295": "But how do you make it shine through the walls?",
  "30296": "What, do you want to leave us?",
  "30297": "Do you stand me out, mistress?",
  "30298": "How is the poor woman?",
  "30299": "Or, that she should prefer the rant of flattery to the simple accents of sincerity?",
  "30300": "Are you a gentleman?",
  "30301": "Did you speak?",
  "30302": "Shall I see you again before your departure?",
  "30303": "And how are the other people getting on?",
  "30304": "Why should I not go?",
  "30305": "And if they are not fortifying, sire?",
  "30306": "But hark, what music is that?",
  "30307": "What do you suppose they would do to a man disarmed like me?",
  "30308": "Are you really frightened, madame?",
  "30309": "What are you doing, you stupid creature?",
  "30310": "Who will undertake it, if it be not also a service of honour?",
  "30311": "What have you heard?",
  "30312": "But as for me, what solace had I when the days of my fighting were done?",
  "30313": "You were not unfortunate, and yet you are an orphan, fatherless and motherless?",
  "30314": "Would not that have been better evidence?",
  "30315": "Where was my head when I made that grant?",
  "30316": "How will she take it?",
  "30317": "And you order me to announce you to the duchess?",
  "30318": "What more has happened?",
  "30319": "Why did you not tell me, instead of teasing me like this?",
  "30320": "Judah told you?",
  "30321": "So far we are within the bounds of possibility, are we not?",
  "30322": "Will the train soon be in?",
  "30323": "What is your opinion?",
  "30324": "How was it, having so little in reality to conceal, that I always DID feel as if this man were finding me out?",
  "30325": "What I wanted, who can say?",
  "30326": "And pray how do I and these my friends around me seem to you?",
  "30327": "Ah, are you composing poetry, queen?",
  "30328": "What is the use of being exquisite if you are not seen by the best judges?",
  "30329": "Then what was the use of our coming?",
  "30330": "Why do you disappoint me so?",
  "30331": "Are you a child or a teetotum?",
  "30332": "Take head?",
  "30333": "The date?",
  "30334": "Would I do him this favour?",
  "30335": "Do you mind if I go in and tell this man to come on to us when he's finished here?",
  "30336": "Is it in this particular part, or in that other?",
  "30337": "Are you ready to get back the trade on those terms?",
  "30338": "To what does your ambition aspire?",
  "30339": "And all complaining, accusing?",
  "30340": "Is she like me?",
  "30341": "What, none of you?",
  "30342": "You will fulfill your promise to me?",
  "30343": "What sort of animal is this interest?",
  "30344": "You must have known that?",
  "30345": "Was it not I?",
  "30346": "And am I dishonest?",
  "30347": "What's the letter?",
  "30348": "Would it please you to accompany her upon the lake?",
  "30349": "Ladies and gentlemen, what is your opinion on the subject?",
  "30350": "What do you want, sir?",
  "30351": "And where can a man seek ends of any sort beyond this broad field?",
  "30352": "How came you to make such a mistake as this?",
  "30353": "Is it too late?",
  "30354": "How do you feel now?",
  "30355": "Anne, did YOU put sugar in these peas?",
  "30356": "That is to say, justice is useful when money is useless?",
  "30357": "Is not this second infinite, so to speak, subjacent to the first?",
  "30358": "And he said nothing as he died?",
  "30359": "WHO forbade you?",
  "30360": "Gallia out of place?",
  "30361": "And am I not ready to do so again?",
  "30362": "Frightened of what?",
  "30363": "Where do we go first?",
  "30364": "Where are you?",
  "30365": "How did you get yourself into this mess?",
  "30366": "It is not in your possession?",
  "30367": "Will your excellency give your name, or remain incognito?",
  "30368": "Legal proceedings to prevent payment?",
  "30369": "Have you any sort of conveyance?",
  "30370": "I suppose you kissed his hand?",
  "30371": "What's in it?",
  "30372": "How dare you look into this garden?",
  "30373": "How find a straight road of progress, you men of science, of industry, of cooperation, of trades unions, and all the rest?",
  "30374": "Really?",
  "30375": "Is this gentle and lovely being lost forever?",
  "30376": "Weigh out tragedy, like butcher's meat?",
  "30377": "Happy?",
  "30378": "What mingles in the strain?",
  "30379": "What can that be, monsieur le chevalier?",
  "30380": "Why do you seek me?",
  "30381": "What, to buy gingerbread?",
  "30382": "Have the fugitives been pursued?",
  "30383": "Is he likely to marry, uncle?",
  "30384": "Not even a sou?",
  "30385": "What did he want?",
  "30386": "Of course it is very different here, but who knows how long it will last?",
  "30387": "Do you ever try to read your own face?",
  "30388": "No accident has happened to him?",
  "30389": "What have you to do with us?",
  "30390": "What's his name?",
  "30391": "Why, then, I would ask, do we see these lengthened shadows, which follow in the course of our political day?",
  "30392": "And how are they all?",
  "30393": "Larrey?",
  "30394": "Is this his house?",
  "30395": "Who is the man that seeks another man?",
  "30396": "Why, do you smoke?",
  "30397": "Will you have it now?",
  "30398": "When shall we get away?",
  "30399": "Good gracious, what's that?",
  "30400": "Have you been there?",
  "30401": "But why have you come the back way?",
  "30402": "What would you like to have?",
  "30403": "But does the painter know the right form of the bit and reins?",
  "30404": "Indeed?",
  "30405": "Why this jealousy of our advancement?",
  "30406": "With HER?",
  "30407": "And what is justice?",
  "30408": "But how if you and I had married legally, as we were on the point of doing?",
  "30409": "What millions, father?",
  "30410": "WHEREFORE IS LIGHT GIVEN TO HIM THAT IS IN MISERY, AND LIFE UNTO THE BITTER IN SOUL?",
  "30411": "Married him?",
  "30412": "How 't happens?",
  "30413": "Why these splendid buskins?",
  "30414": "Better than what?",
  "30415": "And may I escape by the door, sir, when I have opened it?",
  "30416": "But why with melancholy?",
  "30417": "Do you think that I deserve a recompense?",
  "30418": "Can I take the apple blossoms with me for company?",
  "30419": "How could any vanquish such a mighty antagonist?",
  "30420": "What are you dreaming of?",
  "30421": "Like whom?",
  "30422": "Why did I not fall in love with her then and propose to her?",
  "30423": "I suppose you've got your thumbs?",
  "30424": "Just's?",
  "30425": "And how long were you in the hole?",
  "30426": "What, all sons of silence, no spirit?",
  "30427": "If he fears me, why come hither?",
  "30428": "What do you reckon we better do, now?",
  "30429": "Was it for happiness they wept?",
  "30430": "Mother, may I sit on the sofa beside you?",
  "30431": "False?",
  "30432": "Babies?",
  "30433": "Where did you address your letters, then?",
  "30434": "You know what they say?",
  "30435": "The first question is, of what nature was her communication?",
  "30436": "Why are you wandering about like an outcast?",
  "30437": "But, miss, you will hear one word?",
  "30438": "And to go to the root of the matter, why are you so positively convinced that not to act against his real normal interests guaranteed by the conclusions of reason and arithmetic is certainly always advantageous for man and must always be a law for mankind?",
  "30439": "Does the count know what answer you received?",
  "30440": "Is, then, the woman, who holds out to the bitter end in her desire to have the last word, in so far virtuous?",
  "30441": "Shall we return to the camp?",
  "30442": "Query, ought it not, in strict grammar, to be injecerit, instead of infecit?",
  "30443": "Then you are giving it up?",
  "30444": "Is there anything else that puzzles you?",
  "30445": "Would you leave our village, desert our homes and fly before an enemy approaches?",
  "30446": "What are you to her?",
  "30447": "I expect you're feeling very 'appy today, sir?",
  "30448": "What could your ladyship propose by it?",
  "30449": "Who, then, has more luck than I have?",
  "30450": "When did they cease to be so?",
  "30451": "And what did you detect, if not gratitude?",
  "30452": "Speak I soothly, men of greenwood?",
  "30453": "And do you mean to tell me that I should have been the same man if I had not from a boy associated that old tower with all ideas of what its owners were, and should be, as knights and gentlemen?",
  "30454": "But what made her do that?",
  "30455": "But where will he touch?",
  "30456": "Now what will you take?",
  "30457": "Rupert?",
  "30458": "Do you think to overawe us by this?",
  "30459": "Can you understand it?",
  "30460": "That makes in all?",
  "30461": "Where's your leg?",
  "30462": "Or morn or weary even?",
  "30463": "But will the imitator have either?",
  "30464": "Are you an angel?",
  "30465": "A flash in the pan or a shot?",
  "30466": "Is it the last occupant's furniture?",
  "30467": "But if I were to die, what would you do then?",
  "30468": "That being so, what did it mean?",
  "30469": "Could I believe my eyes?",
  "30470": "You mean all's lost?",
  "30471": "Is what true, madame?",
  "30472": "And pray why?",
  "30473": "Do you know for certain that he was at home last night?",
  "30474": "And who'll manage the matron?",
  "30475": "Through what?",
  "30476": "How does it come about at all?",
  "30477": "How was that, uncle?",
  "30478": "Laugh?",
  "30479": "Are not these very simple truths?",
  "30480": "Is this then an actual force?",
  "30481": "What can she want more?",
  "30482": "What schoolboy of fourteen is ignorant of this remarkable circumstance?",
  "30483": "Whether or not I was properly dressed?",
  "30484": "Quanti per inane volatus?",
  "30485": "Is that what you did at school?",
  "30486": "Perhaps you will think, sir, that prosperity has spoiled me?",
  "30487": "How much do you want?",
  "30488": "What king did not seat him at his table?",
  "30489": "But 'Who, even now, would ever believe it?",
  "30490": "What's to be done?",
  "30491": "You are sure you are not mistaken?",
  "30492": "Do you want to spend anything now?",
  "30493": "Has the girl said anything to you to make you feel thus?",
  "30494": "Do you recollect him?",
  "30495": "If so, what are the key enabling technologies?",
  "30496": "Is this to insult me?",
  "30497": "What side of oneself does one display in evasions?",
  "30498": "And was it a fine baby?",
  "30499": "What are you stopping here for?",
  "30500": "Can you guess why I did that?",
  "30501": "Or what great danger dwells upon my suit?",
  "30502": "My genus, is that you?",
  "30503": "Would you so fain have her as you pretend?",
  "30504": "What is the good of the ear if it tells you the same as the eye?",
  "30505": "Perhaps you do not wish to accept my proposition?",
  "30506": "And you repent already?",
  "30507": "An answer?",
  "30508": "Come now, that's the great thing?",
  "30509": "Was it to be in church?",
  "30510": "What do you intend to ask him?",
  "30511": "Vat I mean?",
  "30512": "Would you like to see the pawnbroker himself?",
  "30513": "Could he, too, write like that, express the melancholy of his soul in verse?",
  "30514": "So the question was, what to do?",
  "30515": "Well enough to question him in that language?",
  "30516": "But what's the meaning of it all?",
  "30517": "Then do you know what I did?",
  "30518": "Might I crave your favour to carry my name to him, and say I beg to say a word in his ear?",
  "30519": "Ah kin you tell wether I've a soul or not?",
  "30520": "What money?",
  "30521": "Is your tobacco perfumed, servant, that you swear by the sweet smoke?",
  "30522": "Could any thing worse be said of property?",
  "30523": "How could it be any other way?",
  "30524": "It is then so near the end?",
  "30525": "Do you know this gentleman?",
  "30526": "May I submit your theory of managing soldiers to a slight test?",
  "30527": "And you mean to tell me that I have been wrong?",
  "30528": "Did she think she was going to have all the money, and to marry somebody she liked?",
  "30529": "Who nails up the coffin?",
  "30530": "Would he, too, weep for him?",
  "30531": "Next?",
  "30532": "You have heard of my dear father, then?",
  "30533": "What does he want?",
  "30534": "Why, is there no cause?",
  "30535": "Shall I assist you in repairing your negligence?",
  "30536": "What's it all about?",
  "30537": "Who would understand their various languages, or direct their stranger and incompatible manners?",
  "30538": "Might she not have to grow used to me and to begin all over again?",
  "30539": "What has your life been, so far?",
  "30540": "Are you strong enough to face it alone?",
  "30541": "HOW WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT A SUPERFICIES TERMINATES IN A POINT?",
  "30542": "Do you talk of a sacrifice?",
  "30543": "Then he sent them a herald asking if they wished to be cut to pieces for the sake of those who had betrayed them, or save their lives and keep their reputation for gallantry?",
  "30544": "But what was the reason of this indignation?",
  "30545": "Had he lacked an opportunity?",
  "30546": "Why do you speak of the unhappiness of your father's wife?",
  "30547": "Where is your father's place of business?",
  "30548": "What profits that?",
  "30549": "Hear me, sir?",
  "30550": "Ah, you will tell all I have said, will you not, reverend sir?",

  "30557": "But how can they think so?",
  "30558": "What think you of that, my daughter?",
  "30559": "Seems you have been out after such?",
  "30560": "Was it not a direct menace against the work which he and his companions had till now conducted so successfully?",
  "30561": "For which side?",
  "30562": "Do you remember what I told you last time?",
  "30563": "What further commands has my lord?",
  "30564": "What have you seen?",
  "30565": "Not play?",

  "30567": "Every word?",
  "30568": "Reproaching you for what?",
  "30569": "And then?",
  "30570": "Do you care for him?",
  "30571": "Do you think that I would tell you a falsehood about it?",
  "30572": "Will that do, or is it too genteel?",
  "30573": "Is there no devil to help me?",
  "30574": "You think it's possible?",
  "30575": "The hanging?",
  "30576": "How can he go about making acquaintances?",
  "30577": "But now what are your plans?",
  "30578": "Will you, I ask once more, show your belief in me by letting me clasp you with my arm?",
  "30579": "Kiesewetter?",
  "30580": "Hope he'll see her?",
  "30581": "Is it, then important?",
  "30582": "Did you really?",
  "30583": "What reason?",
  "30584": "I wonder what's the reason?",
  "30585": "How could they fail to see how they were ruining themselves, lowering their prestige by this appointment?",
  "30586": "Will he continue to give lectures in virtue?",
  "30587": "Why do you flee?",
  "30588": "They ask me, are they to light the candles that have been lighted before or candles that have never been lighted?",

  "30590": "On whom did it depend?",
  "30591": "What is it, gentlemen?",
  "30592": "Suppose I refuse?",
  "30593": "That young girl whom they were abducting was not to be brought back?",
  "30594": "Would that be your way of speaking?",

  "30608": "What can I do better in the interval between this and the setting of the sun?",
  "30609": "Do personal relations lead to sloppiness in the end?",
  "30610": "And you, being a good man, can pass it as such, and forgive and pity the dreamer, and be lenient and encouraging when he wakes?",
  "30611": "What means the woman?",
  "30612": "Should he descend and make a race for the distant cliffs, or should he hide here until night?",
  "30613": "But what are your intentions?",
  "30614": "Would that make his fortune?",

  "30652": "How has all that been done?",
  "30653": "When is the next rehearsal?",
  "30654": "What has been the matter?",
  "30655": "Where's the flax?",
  "30656": "And what shall we make of him, now we've got him?",
  "30657": "But why does anyone object to his being a dirty fellow?",
  "30658": "To be probable?",

  "30702": "Oh, did you?",
  "30703": "And for your sons?",
  "30704": "Shall not I be a cuckold?",
  "30705": "Whose fault was it?",
  "30706": "Who's interfering with which?",
  "30707": "He certainly likes the child, but will he love me less as his affection grows for her?",
  "30708": "What odds, dear boy?",
  "30709": "What order could be maintained?",
  "30710": "But would you wish your vengeance to do you harm instead of good?",
  "30711": "When there were no people in the bungalow, did we have any mongoose in the garden?",
  "30712": "What are all those good people laughing at over there?",
  "30713": "To arrest you?",
  "30714": "The singers?",
  "30715": "And if it were so, would it be possible to make others so believe?",
  "30716": "But property on what condition?",
  "30717": "How would you like it?",
  "30718": "But has she made you any less discontented with me?",
  "30719": "When's the wedding to be?",
  "30720": "Have you noticed his clothes?",
  "30721": "Has the moon been inhabited?",
  "30722": "You find it too much for you?",
  "30723": "Well, and how shall I receive him?",
  "30724": "What else can we do, what in all the world else?",
  "30725": "You, gentle brother, forged this for my sake?",
  "30726": "That's all you have come for, is it?",
  "30727": "What's a bar sinister?",
  "30728": "What says it?",
  "30729": "I beg your pardon, sir, but I think those gentlemen are military?",
  "30730": "Should I tell him or should I not tell him?",
  "30731": "And who stands safest?",
  "30732": "Lieutenant?",
  "30733": "A sailor, I believe?",
  "30734": "What was the difference between that gallant that's gone and you, sir?",
  "30735": "Are you quite sure of that?",
  "30736": "How can you bear to speak so lightly?",
  "30737": "It is now my turn to ask you 'why?",
  "30738": "Not even got a pencil on you?",
  "30739": "Where, for instance?",
  "30740": "Well, what did he do?",
  "30741": "Why should a man hold a match to the side of his pipe?",
  "30742": "What is it?",
  "30743": "And there it ended?",
  "30744": "Why must I be kept forever muffled up in a scarf and padded boots?",
  "30745": "What in creation made you call him a thief?",
  "30746": "That village a few miles off?",
  "30747": "But why do I not find this rest for this weary heart?",
  "30748": "Why not do something original?",
  "30749": "What are you thinking about?",
  "30750": "How would wild horses drag a secret from a person anyhow?",
  "30751": "But what is the use of it?",
  "30752": "And did he go?",
  "30753": "Is there no way by which I can get it?",
  "30754": "And if any, what?",
  "30755": "Carstone?",
  "30756": "Do you know how to stitch caps?",
  "30757": "And all only for sport?",
  "30758": "Why are we perverse and ask for something else?",
  "30759": "And did he think amiss?",
  "30760": "Is he stupid?",
  "30761": "Was it to end with me?",
  "30762": "What faculty?",
  "30763": "I hope, prince, that you are too progressive to deny this?",
  "30764": "Zaccone?",
  "30765": "How do you do again?",
  "30766": "The race?",
  "30767": "What became of you?",
  "30768": "O why?",
  "30769": "Shall we slay him with our pikes?",
  "30770": "A wedding?",
  "30771": "Deserted you?",
  "30772": "Can any here give a name to such a cry?",
  "30773": "What means this outrage?",
  "30774": "Have you been enjoying yourself?",
  "30775": "And nobody called respecting it?",
  "30776": "When one will have defeated the other, of whom can he complain who has the worst of it?",
  "30777": "By the by, my dear friend, do you not think it would have puzzled these ancient dogmaticians to have determined by which of their two roads it was that the most important and most sublime of all their truths was, in effect, attained?",
  "30778": "Then whom, ARE you talking about?",
  "30779": "You mean that this demands explanation, do you not?",
  "30780": "Can it be a song of joy?",
  "30781": "Did it move, did it float on the surface of the ocean, or did it dive into its depths?",
  "30782": "Reasonable well, I give you thanks, wont you alight?",
  "30783": "Do the gentlemen say so?",
  "30784": "Beasts, did you say?",
  "30785": "Who is coming to tea?",
  "30786": "Put an end?",
  "30787": "How can I tell him to be sober when I have been a beast all my life?",
  "30788": "If free, would he attempt to fly, or would he remain?",
  "30789": "They're not far from here, then?",
  "30790": "Were you a steward or a stoker in those days?",
  "30791": "Is it true that force and right are necessarily on the same side in republican governments?",
  "30792": "Are you aware how small his means are, and of the straitened circumstances of his widow?",
  "30793": "My own?",
  "30794": "It was to meet him here that you came?",
  "30795": "Had he not cause for triumph?",
  "30796": "Will you hear me?",
  "30797": "Never more to be separated?",
  "30798": "What disguise do you propose to adopt?",
  "30799": "How was that managed?",
  "30800": "Is it not so, my friends?",
  "30801": "And he has accepted the call?",
  "30802": "How long have you been cooling your eye there?",
  "30803": "What name go you by?",
  "30804": "And what truth?",
  "30805": "Yes, where is this letter?",
  "30806": "Where away, cook?",
  "30807": "And with regard to the past?",
  "30808": "A deanery for her brother in the church?",
  "30809": "What shall we have, said he, to drink in these deserts?",
  "30810": "Is there any collective action which cannot find its justification in political unity, in patriotism, in the balance of power, or in civilization?",
  "30811": "Lady, when was it that your heart was there?",
  "30812": "Where is humanity?",
  "30813": "Where did he live, then?",
  "30814": "What have I done?",
  "30815": "Whom do you wish to speak about?",
  "30816": "You remain near this part?",
  "30817": "Pray what is your own theory as to what took place?",
  "30818": "What?",
  "30819": "She would smile on me, she would say a word to me, would that do any harm to any one?",
  "30820": "How are you, dear child?",
  "30821": "What origin do they attribute to these rifts?",
  "30822": "Do you think I am not grateful?",
  "30823": "WHAT did you see her doing?",
  "30824": "Under these circumstances, was it perfectly certain that no danger could accrue?",
  "30825": "Why should society work out an extraordinary system of rewards for those whom it is already rewarding automatically?",
  "30826": "If, secondly, the question is asked whether this being is substance, whether it is of the greatest reality, whether it is necessary, and so forth?",
  "30827": "How could I wait so long?",
  "30828": "Well, have I convinced you?",
  "30829": "Oh, where am I to go?",
  "30830": "You will not let me speak?",
  "30831": "Nothing, I suppose?",
  "30832": "And if they were pleased, would that make them immortal?",
  "30833": "What do they say to this?",
  "30834": "What design has the cardinal upon you to make him so generous?",
  "30835": "Is it indeed so?",
  "30836": "How came you to be walking here?",
  "30837": "There is the other service, the old one, that which belonged to my husband?",
  "30838": "A room just above?",
  "30839": "Will their successors falter and plead organic impotency in the nation?",
  "30840": "Now what do you think?",
  "30841": "It is in my power, think you, to make such a change at demand?",
  "30842": "It will have pity?",
  "30843": "What can I propose?",
  "30844": "Should I not be disingenuously serving my own ends?",
  "30845": "How is bread made?",
  "30846": "Do you recall him?",
  "30847": "Landlords?",
  "30848": "Should they ever again find themselves in the midst of their friends, or seated at the domestic hearth?",
  "30849": "To lead me to my death, is that enough?",
  "30850": "What use am I to make of your instruction?",
  "30851": "Where?",
  "30852": "Shall we, then, establish it for a general maxim, that no refined or elaborate reasoning is ever to be received?",
  "30853": "How did you get such big big hips?",
  "30854": "How about me?",
  "30855": "Oh?",
  "30856": "Is it deemed a holy place in the land, then?",
  "30857": "The king has not signed, however?",
  "30858": "Why the delay of a reargument?",
  "30859": "But how do you know?",
  "30860": "Should I ever meet you there?",
  "30861": "But if he did marry her in spite of the threat?",
  "30862": "Did I say a peach?",
  "30863": "What has happened since then to give you a completely new idea of the case?",
  "30864": "Has a young man, such as I am, gone through this morning, then?",
  "30865": "What am I to say, indoors?",
  "30866": "How did he evolve his ethics?",
  "30867": "Have you seen the thief?",
  "30868": "Do virtuous men, in so far as they are virtuous, stand in each other's light?",
  "30869": "Shall we bathe this morning?",
  "30870": "What's the matter now, ma'am?",
  "30871": "And is no allowance to be made for inadvertence, or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment?",
  "30872": "Or is it actual?",
  "30873": "How does she look?",
  "30874": "Married another?",
  "30875": "Do with him?",
  "30876": "And what may his name be, coptain?",
  "30877": "You might have stayed away, I suppose, if you would?",
  "30878": "Brown, convicted of mutinous conduct and sentenced to death?",
  "30879": "Who will become the sharer of this dangerous secret?",
  "30880": "What is the gift of conquest but safety?",
  "30881": "French, eh?",
  "30882": "Is he too so very remarkable?",
  "30883": "Who do you think is going to be married tomorrow?",
  "30884": "Both, on the other hand, had joined pretty gaily in the conversation, for why should they interrupt it?",
  "30885": "I regulate my watch?",
  "30886": "Do you hear, sir?",
  "30887": "How can girls like to have lovers and refuse them?",
  "30888": "Have you finished tea?",
  "30889": "What like was she?",
  "30890": "Has anything extraordinary happened to you?",
  "30891": "Who made this gruel here?",
  "30892": "And where are they?",
  "30893": "If you had been born such, would you have been here now?",
  "30894": "But how do you come here?",
  "30895": "But I wonder is it so very nice?",
  "30896": "Did it hurt you much?",
  "30897": "On what principle, then, shall we any longer choose justice rather than the worst injustice?",
  "30898": "Do you reckon YOU can learn 'em anything?",
  "30899": "What do I read here?",
  "30900": "What woman can before her husband?",
  "30901": "Who has the right to dictate to my conscience, and where did he get that right?",
  "30902": "Is she coming, and open, free?",
  "30903": "By your orders?",
  "30904": "To dig the foundations out from under that cabin with?",
  "30905": "My dear child, how can I help minding?",
  "30906": "Is this so?",
  "30907": "You'll make up for it by making another?",
  "30908": "Bubbles?",
  "30909": "Are you willing to endure to the last, and not once attempt a repayment?",
  "30910": "What are they, my dear friend?",
  "30911": "I hope you think so?",
  "30912": "But why on earth should it bother him?",
  "30913": "I wonder whether I've done well in advising that amusement?",
  "30914": "Had I?",
  "30915": "Jack?",
  "30916": "What means can I take to introduce it to the world?",
  "30917": "And so it came about that the young rat did see a good deal of the world, but how?",
  "30918": "But they will contest the will after your death?",
  "30919": "Walks by night, does she?",
  "30920": "And who is it to belong to?",
  "30921": "Is that enough?",
  "30922": "What about souls?",
  "30923": "But what have you been doing?",
  "30924": "Do we need common sense and fairness in our regulations?",
  "30925": "Oh, who does not desire to dwell forever and forever in that city of love and light when the pains and sorrows, the trials and tears, of this weary life are over?",
  "30926": "Have you let your lodgings, ma'am?",
  "30927": "Ought we to rank this one species with bears, and what should we do with the other species?",
  "30928": "Were you not engaged in it then?",
  "30929": "How do you know that, sir?",
  "30930": "Is it conscious?",
  "30931": "What do you know on the subject?",
  "30932": "And what, pray, is your idea of the duties of a devoted friend?",
  "30933": "Who can desire it more than I?",
  "30934": "What would you propose doing?",
  "30935": "What chance have I?",
  "30936": "What were his charms?",
  "30937": "Why should they not work for a uniform minimum of labour conditions through all their communities?",
  "30938": "So he has turned you out?",
  "30939": "Come for long?",
  "30940": "By the way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from?",
  "30941": "Why should he be so mean now?",
  "30942": "DO with it?",
  "30943": "Ask you what provocation I have had?",
  "30944": "Not know the thing which my own eyes beheld?",
  "30945": "Anything else?",
  "30946": "Will you taste for yourself?",
  "30947": "It's not a very nice night to be out, is it?",
  "30948": "You'll come and meet me as usual, girls?",
  "30949": "Now, had I come upon a hopeless incompatibility?",
  "30950": "Do you know what you're doing?",
  "30951": "Quite a vineyard, hey?",
  "30952": "Do I flatter myself if I allow myself to look at it in that way?",
  "30953": "Have I done right?",
  "30954": "He's all right?",
  "30955": "How can I ever thank you for all the deep obligations you impose upon me every day?",
  "30956": "Ought we not to make something great out of a youth, under twenty, who has, in the highest degree, quickness to conceive and courage to execute?",
  "30957": "Was there no loophole of escape?",
  "30958": "I suppose we must take the shapes of beasts?",
  "30959": "What are you surprised at?",
  "30960": "What did they matter when he played divinely?",
  "30961": "Tell me the why of this?",
  "30962": "But is it that makes you go?",
  "30963": "Will you graciously let me kiss your hand?",
  "30964": "Who are you to ask me my business?",
  "30965": "But does not this question make a disturbance outside of political circles?",
  "30966": "What influence can I possibly have over a bandit?",
  "30967": "Is there a carriage at the door?",
  "30968": "Do you still wish to do so?",
  "30969": "At all events, what use was there in delaying?",
  "30970": "And what right had she to be cross?",
  "30971": "What's the good, if you're sick with love for him?",
  "30972": "How should you?",
  "30973": "Is that fine, keen edge upon your soul that gives such avidity for holy things?",
  "30974": "What of the resemblance?",
  "30975": "Why a locksmiths' association in a village?",
  "30976": "Or must I fly the country altogether?",
  "30977": "What would have been the result?",
  "30978": "Back at last?",
  "30979": "What else could this fragment be but the sole surviving remnant of some sumptuous mansion that once had stood on this unrivaled site?",
  "30980": "In relation to what objects?",
  "30981": "You WERE afraid?",
  "30982": "Do you think I am deceiving you?",
  "30983": "How can you know what he is?",
  "30984": "What were you eating there all by yourself for your dinner?",
  "30985": "Are you going to sail in?",
  "30986": "Wonder if you'll ever drag me up there?",
  "30987": "Is there any need to hurry, sir?",
  "30988": "Still I ask you, what is this to me?",
  "30989": "And leave the litter as it is?",
  "30990": "Do you advance with him?",
  "30991": "So perhaps I shall rub on?",
  "30992": "In front or behind?",
  "30993": "And by what authority?",
  "30994": "Yea, what then?",
  "30995": "I really could not say?",
  "30996": "And does he imagine that the coadjutor will put himself out for him?",
  "30997": "Do you think she will ever forget that her son is her safeguard, her shield, the pledge for her dignity, for her fortune and her life?",
  "30998": "You said prince, did you not?",
  "30999": "Was it worth it?",
  "31000": "What young ladies?",
  "31001": "Shall we turn back?",
  "31002": "At the end of your name stands for?",
  "31003": "Is it not time to decide finally the meaning of the gift of the great fortune now all in your hand, and growing?",
  "31004": "Well, are we going to stand here all day?",
  "31005": "Who would not acknowledge that a poor man or woman, fain to earn daily bread by the sweat of the brow, is far more reprehensible in yielding to the solicitations of love, than a rich lady, whose life is lapped in ease and unrestricted luxury?",
  "31006": "Have we reached the limits of what reason can supply?",
  "31007": "What should I say?",
  "31008": "Did you ever, O king, hear a cat purring over a bowl of broth, or the buzzing of beetles in the twilight, or a shrill tongued old woman scolding your head off?",
  "31009": "What will gladden your heart?",
  "31010": "Are you sure it will be the last time?",
  "31011": "What is that for a man to do?",
  "31012": "Since when?",
  "31013": "Why, soldiers, why?",
  "31014": "How came you to read some of those queerer ones?",
  "31015": "Did you not love your husband either?",
  "31016": "Where is true peace or true glory?",
  "31017": "How is it now?",
  "31018": "Durys?",
  "31019": "Has the reality of them ever been perceived by you through the bodily organs?",
  "31020": "Which girls should love?",
  "31021": "When was it?",
  "31022": "Does it belong to anybody in the neighbourhood?",
  "31023": "Has anything happened?",
  "31024": "Did you hit her?",
  "31025": "Is there any signal for the general rally?",
  "31026": "About what age is he?",
  "31027": "And why did I come here?",
  "31028": "What mercy can you expect from the man whom you have wronged?",
  "31029": "Have I taken an oath of some sort, then?",
  "31030": "Shall we say, in such a case, that the will of the majority was for the ultimate end?",
  "31031": "Where what?",
  "31032": "You say?",
  "31033": "Do you no longer like to think of your mother?",
  "31034": "What are you doing?",
  "31035": "May I understand, sir, that you threat is withdrawn, and that my income is secure?",
  "31036": "Are the two so deeply separated in this town, that there is no place whatever for an honest workman between them?",
  "31037": "Why then should a man cling to a longer stay here?",
  "31038": "The symptoms are marked, do you see?",
  "31039": "Whether fate, whose circle surrounds us, exercises a control over our liberty so imperious and compulsory that infractions of the law, committed under the dominion of antinomies, cease to be imputable to us?",
  "31040": "But supposing we had the authority, I would ask what good can result from the examination?",
  "31041": "What am I coming for?",
  "31042": "But settled?",
  "31043": "Did I like his voice?",
  "31044": "How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor?",
  "31045": "Who to?",
  "31046": "And the girl?",
  "31047": "Well, have you had a good hunt, have you botanised successfully?",
  "31048": "And why should you want to spite her?",
  "31049": "What did you pick me up for?",
  "31050": "And what does 'in my name' mean?",
  "31051": "Have you ever seen it?",
  "31052": "When, then, did father and son exchange shields, and why?",
  "31053": "Would he have been justified in sacrificing his own child, even if he could thereby save another's?",
  "31054": "Why are you only laying one place?",
  "31055": "Loves him?",
  "31056": "Yet who are the folk whom you find HERE?",
  "31057": "Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?",
  "31058": "Who is coming in here?",
  "31059": "What was she going to say, and what reply would she get?",
  "31060": "Can you tell me how to go about getting on the stage?",
  "31061": "What was your idea, then?",
  "31062": "Running from what?",
  "31063": "Valdemar?",
  "31064": "How are you going to manage to get out?",
  "31065": "Have you a portmanteau?",
  "31066": "What does it matter?",
  "31067": "What depth have we now reached?",
  "31068": "What the deuse do we men go to school for?",
  "31069": "If it be called swamp or sky?",
  "31070": "How the devil is he so like?",
  "31071": "Once more, will you undertake it?",
  "31072": "Are not these functions proper to the soul, and can they rightly be assigned to any other?",
  "31073": "Was it sheer blind force of passion that would satisfy her now?",
  "31074": "How's this, dear niece?",
  "31075": "Do you know who that was?",
  "31076": "Was SHE at the ball too?",
  "31077": "And what made you ask it of me?",
  "31078": "Do you know that if we should ship, it would serve you quite right?",
  "31079": "Where are your wits?",
  "31080": "Is it possible, dear, that what I hear is true?",
  "31081": "No clue?",
  "31082": "Will you give me as far from the river as you can distinguish the belly of a horse?",
  "31083": "So what if he died, how did this concern the boy?",
  "31084": "Build I in the winds my dwelling?",
  "31085": "And what more free than he that desireth nothing upon earth?",
  "31086": "And you have them?",
  "31087": "Did I indeed, sir?",
  "31088": "And are greater miracles to be performed by those who do not follow his footsteps, who healed the body to reach the mind?",
  "31089": "And did I say there was any difficulty?",
  "31090": "Have I not got a brave determination of all my doubts, and a response in all things agreeable to the oracle that gave it?",
  "31091": "Could I leave the lady alone?",
  "31092": "Is it really?",
  "31093": "Do you think I'm not sufficiently ruining my health living here amid the continual emanations of the pharmacy?",
  "31094": "How should she be able to compose herself when she should first see him?",
  "31095": "But tell me, what would you have done?",
  "31096": "Confused?",
  "31097": "Wherefrom do they acquire these tendencies, these peculiarities?",
  "31098": "Who first seduced them to that foul revolt?",
  "31099": "If they want to jump down, now, and get into trouble, who objects?",
  "31100": "Do you regard that meaning as offensive?",
  "31101": "And why does the former operation end exactly when the latter commences?",
  "31102": "What is your notion?",
  "31103": "What now was my plain duty?",
  "31104": "But where can one jump to?",
  "31105": "And how were they?",
  "31106": "Who told you his name?",
  "31107": "Who and where is he?",
  "31108": "Shall we then raise cuckolds?",
  "31109": "But that I make no admissions?",
  "31110": "Am I deceived?",
  "31111": "What's the good of daylight now?",
  "31112": "Does any man ask himself what profit he has gained from the fulfilment of his dreams, if he must still endure, still undergo hunger and thirst and toil and trouble and care?",
  "31113": "What are the facts?",
  "31114": "Have you nothing to say to us?",
  "31115": "Can you tell when there is a good fire?",
  "31116": "What on earth will she say to me, I wonder?",
  "31117": "Did you anticipate the accident which has happened to your granddaughter?",
  "31118": "What cause had you to make discoveries of his pretended passion?",
  "31119": "Elopement?",
  "31120": "How shall I be able to endure life for thirteen years?",
  "31121": "How deeply sir, you apprehend it?",
  "31122": "Cake or bread and butter?",
  "31123": "Or might you have only travelled for your amusement?",
  "31124": "Who has not seen poor birds caught by their feet in the lime?",
  "31125": "I have seen you before, I think?",
  "31126": "Does not the practice of despoiling an enemy afford an excuse for not facing the battle?",
  "31127": "The place is then, as you know, determined on rebellion?",
  "31128": "And was that the upshot of my life's hardest battle?",
  "31129": "When did you shed tears over lost souls?",
  "31130": "Is it not horrible?",
  "31131": "On plantation?",
  "31132": "When you say it that way it sounds comical, does it not?",
  "31133": "What did you do with the girl?",
  "31134": "Who would want to injure us, or damage the projectile?",
  "31135": "How do you distinguish them?",
  "31136": "Haidee, would it please you not to leave me?",
  "31137": "In the name of the ninth day, what manner of creature are you?",
  "31138": "It is then a service which you propose to render us, count?",
  "31139": "Why a blue coat?",
  "31140": "Are you here for good?",
  "31141": "What was I telling you?",
  "31142": "Snakes?",
  "31143": "Ought she to shrink in this way from the long penance of life, which was all the possibility she had of lightening the load to some other sufferers, and so changing that passionate error into a new force of unselfish human love?",
  "31144": "May I ask you a question?",
  "31145": "And yet does not your honor fear to compromise yourself by allowing such a sum to be carried away for the service of your enemy?",
  "31146": "Then have we got to part?",
  "31147": "But what do you want to do with these chickens?",
  "31148": "Do you suggest that I should do that to a similarly garbed female?",
  "31149": "And if I do not read it, what shall you do, mamma?",
  "31150": "What is going on here?",
  "31151": "Can I see her first?",
  "31152": "And the profits are large?",
  "31153": "You let him go?",
  "31154": "How can he save them?",
  "31155": "Barkis, do you mean?",
  "31156": "All right, is it?",
  "31157": "Is that the sort of fellow?",
  "31158": "And that's all you want?",
  "31159": "Number of what, child?",
  "31160": "Well, now, when you orators get that off next year, and, may be, this very year, how would you like some old grizzled farmer to get up in the grove and deny it?",
  "31161": "Fluffed in his lines, did he?",
  "31162": "But was resistance and, in the last place, victory possible?",
  "31163": "Ought not a son to love his father, whatever happens?",
  "31164": "Why, you wished to have a talk with me when the others left?",
  "31165": "Have you ever heard anything particular respecting his birth?",
  "31166": "But how did we become engaged?",
  "31167": "Did this man belong to the double enigma of order and disorder?",
  "31168": "Then he has travelled?",
  "31169": "Will you not take my word?",
  "31170": "I pray you say, what would you ask?",
  "31171": "What is the name of this obliging youth?",
  "31172": "Have they sentenced you?",
  "31173": "I am the ghost's accomplice?",
  "31174": "And has not this been our own case in the matter of equals and of absolute equality?",
  "31175": "And if I do my duty and do right, you will sustain me, will you not?",
  "31176": "Do not you also?",
  "31177": "His race, his form, his name almost unknown?",
  "31178": "But you will see him yourself?",
  "31179": "And yet they say that war is like a game of chess?",
  "31180": "But what does he want of them?",
  "31181": "But what's your real name?",
  "31182": "Then why did you stay with us, and blast your prospects?",
  "31183": "And the salary?",
  "31184": "Have you heard the news, sir?",
  "31185": "Or to what port are we bound?",
  "31186": "Why, then, is it, when neither law nor justice forbids it, that we are asked to spend our time and money in inquiring into its truth?",
  "31187": "And what will all her learning and her daintiness do for her, now?",
  "31188": "How has this terrible past been recalled?",
  "31189": "Am I to feed upon wisdom like a dog?",
  "31190": "Indeed, why not?",
  "31191": "Could not you, sir, estimate their maximum?",
  "31192": "Is this the fact?",
  "31193": "Barsad?",
  "31194": "And our poor cactuses, where are they?",
  "31195": "What muscles he had?",
  "31196": "Why, what do you mean?",
  "31197": "No, but what can I do?",
  "31198": "Have they allowed the headsman to escape?",
  "31199": "Is perseverance a virtue?",
  "31200": "Can you ever forgive me?",
  "31201": "You really think that your solution must be correct?",
  "31202": "Have we not already seen enough of the fallacy and extravagance of those idle theories which have amused us with promises of an exemption from the imperfections, weaknesses and evils incident to society in every shape?",
  "31203": "You have nothing further to say to me?",
  "31204": "Shall I cut away?",
  "31205": "Has he asked you to be his wife?",
  "31206": "Now, what's up?",
  "31207": "PISTHETAERUS I?",
  "31208": "Is there anything you dislike in me that you act so contrarily to my wishes?",
  "31209": "Anger?",
  "31210": "Is it not some bad affair?",
  "31211": "Will you do it?",
  "31212": "I wonder how many I shall meet going back?",
  "31213": "Could it be possible that they had escaped?",
  "31214": "Are you SURE you were quite comfortable?",
  "31215": "Had he any weapons?",
  "31216": "Was there no way by which I might have enjoyed in freedom comforts even greater than those which I now earn by servitude?",
  "31217": "What is spirit?",
  "31218": "Then why were you taught to shoot?",
  "31219": "What good comes of it?",
  "31220": "What happened to me?",
  "31221": "What was it that set our two hearts eternally apart and made hope impossible?",
  "31222": "The captain?",
  "31223": "Ruinous, why?",
  "31224": "Was she really a stenographer?",
  "31225": "Is it possible that he died in the bitter frame of mind he was then in?",
  "31226": "And what do you reckon your outfit will cost?",
  "31227": "Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?",
  "31228": "But, by the holy city, why does he make me pay for what anybody else could have for nothing?",
  "31229": "What did he talk about?",
  "31230": "I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your sleep?",
  "31231": "Who was it you were talking with over there?",
  "31232": "You mean that you forget?",
  "31233": "You have a chamber?",
  "31234": "What was I doing with the lady?",
  "31235": "What did they understand by it?",
  "31236": "What does he wish to gain by it, I wonder?",
  "31237": "Is it not a beautiful language and admirable?",
  "31238": "You do not add imagination to your other great qualities, but if you could for one moment put yourself in the place of this young man, would you choose the very night after the will had been made to commit your crime?",
  "31239": "Sdeath, what's this to me?",
  "31240": "Why, what other strangers are coming in?",
  "31241": "Why does the parent turn away from his child, and forbid him his presence for a time?",
  "31242": "What is a shame?",
  "31243": "And you ask me, whether I am an adherent of that church which maligns and damns you?",
  "31244": "You are rich?",
  "31245": "Do you know him still?",
  "31246": "Not understand it, sir?",
  "31247": "If they were all bad, who had made them so?",
  "31248": "What encouraged me not to become your surety, but to patronize you?",
  "31249": "Who ever gave again the breath of a life lost?",
  "31250": "Did he say when he would be back?",
  "31251": "Yes or no, is it an honorable indemnity?",
  "31252": "As how?",
  "31253": "Do you imagine that this anaemic youth was capable of so frightful an assault?",
  "31254": "How many would you have?",
  "31255": "Otherwise why should she thus have concealed herself, fled from the face of others?",
  "31256": "Any money?",
  "31257": "Where stand his coursers?",
  "31258": "What are we coming to?",
  "31259": "And why is one person to be singled out from among millions, and arraigned before posterity as a traitor to his opinions only because events produced on him the effect which they produced on a whole generation?",
  "31260": "But the real cause was heart disease?",
  "31261": "But does he know this secret, then?",
  "31262": "Is he liked for himself?",
  "31263": "What should it be?",
  "31264": "Anybody gone in for her?",
  "31265": "We are overheard, then?",
  "31266": "You other two belong to this division?",
  "31267": "All or one?",
  "31268": "Are you really a connoisseur, now?",
  "31269": "Did he tell you so?",
  "31270": "You have an order signed by the cardinal?",
  "31271": "Why should the degree of sterility be innately variable in the individuals of the same species?",
  "31272": "YOU think so, do you?",
  "31273": "Will you have chains, gold, tablets, rings?",
  "31274": "Where will you begin and where end?",
  "31275": "And what if he does not give in?",
  "31276": "Are you the musical girl?",
  "31277": "A quarrel, and what for, gentlemen?",
  "31278": "I mean your future does?",
  "31279": "Name, sir?",
  "31280": "How will the national workshop, which owes ITS WORKMEN GOOD WAGES, make up this deficit?",
  "31281": "Can I explain it?",
  "31282": "What have you been about?",
  "31283": "Do you want to be grabbed, stupid?",
  "31284": "Toys?",
  "31285": "To your father?",
  "31286": "Mary?",
  "31287": "Meanwhile, what of the enemy?",
  "31288": "Or if there were any so precious as to be able to support this expense, with what safety could they be transported through the territories of so many barbarous nations?",
  "31289": "And what are these?",
  "31290": "Gering is her husband, eh?",
  "31291": "Why had he lived?",
  "31292": "Do you take for philosophy this twaddle, this intolerable pettifoggery adorned with a few scholastic trimmings?",
  "31293": "Suppose a watchman should pass?",
  "31294": "Who was fool enough to occasion this delay?",
  "31295": "They could be sold, then?",
  "31296": "Can you play anything?",
  "31297": "Ought I to have written?",
  "31298": "What have you in the bundle?",
  "31299": "Do you care for that young fellow?",
  "31300": "Well, old lady?",
  "31301": "But you want to speak to me, I suppose?",
  "31302": "Where have you been?",
  "31303": "To compete with phrasemongers, incapable of thinking consecutively for sixty seconds?",
  "31304": "Have I the time?",
  "31305": "Tea?",
  "31306": "What did you begin to tell me about the prince?",
  "31307": "Did anybody ever ask you?",
  "31308": "YOU think so?",
  "31309": "Can you give me no other weapon?",
  "31310": "Is that the moon?",
  "31311": "Nothing but saddles?",
  "31312": "Or would I have all the daughters at once in a perfect nosegay?",
  "31313": "Shall our eyes gaze on and on, and feast themselves on that sight for all eternity?",
  "31314": "What are you making such a noise about over there?",
  "31315": "What is your opinion of the gentlemen with the silk caps who thrive along the boulevard's on the delightful traffic which you know, and who make a living out of it?",
  "31316": "And your home?",
  "31317": "But perhaps you need not now?",
  "31318": "Of what colour is the tip?",
  "31319": "And now tell me what dress will you have?",
  "31320": "What would he be?",
  "31321": "Lorry?",
  "31322": "WHAT'S better?",

  "31326": "Do you see this, monster?",
  "31327": "And how left you mine uncle?",
  "31328": "What necessity was there to seek this situation, and expose myself to misfortunes, affronts and remorse, for the sake of pleasures whose greatest charm was already exhausted?",
  "31329": "Were there no legitimate sons?",
  "31330": "But is it true that the country does wail?",
  "31331": "Our plans for the journey, do you remember?",
  "31332": "Will you tell me?",
  "31333": "Why could he not simply leave the monks alone, and go into the desert to repent?",
  "31334": "Oh, what was that?",
  "31335": "And a pair of oxen?",
  "31336": "Do you think that I felt easy in my mind about you, gentlemen?",
  "31337": "Why not apply the law to human groups, or nations?",
  "31338": "How could it go so far?",
  "31339": "Which is he?",
  "31340": "What would you have said about us then?",
  "31341": "But tell me, how did he?",
  "31342": "What do you demand from me?",

  "31345": "Who can it be?",
  "31346": "Is it particularly dangerous to give the keys of the treasury, and the command of the army, into the same hands?",
  "31347": "Then I suppose I can go?",
  "31348": "Are you absolutely obliged to straighten at once what is crooked?",
  "31349": "What is your pleasure now?",
  "31350": "Has anybody got anything to tell?",
  "31351": "What do you wish, sir?",
  "31352": "And how can they be fortified by habits when they are proved to be fallacious by example?",
  "31353": "THE KING?",
  "31354": "Then what am I to tell him?",
  "31355": "For?",
  "31356": "What can that have to do with my marriage?",
  "31357": "But why do you ask that?",
  "31358": "Is everything ready?",
  "31359": "How did you know?",
  "31360": "Might I have not known that into the pit it was the object of the burning iron to urge me?",

  "31370": "Sit down, will you?",
  "31371": "Who was he?",
  "31372": "Did I not know the process?",
  "31373": "What for, mademoiselle?",
  "31374": "But what will you do?",
  "31375": "Believe ye, men, in the things called omens?",
  "31376": "When will they be here?",
  "31377": "How far is the nearest village from here?",
  "31378": "It is very terrible, is it not, to be like that?",
  "31379": "What's it?",
  "31380": "When two knights have met in an affray of arms and when one has beaten the other, which of the two do you think is the better?",
  "31381": "And where are these four men?",
  "31382": "And what have you gained?",
  "31383": "Was this possible?",
  "31384": "May I look at it?",
  "31385": "Why should it be of any importance to me?",
  "31386": "Did you get shook up much?",

  "31395": "Is there nobody in the house to cheer or help him?",
  "31396": "And the cardinal?",
  "31397": "Why should he not throw over his own people altogether, money, position, society, and all, and give himself up to love?",
  "31398": "Are you at all superstitious?",
  "31399": "But if they die?",
  "31400": "Rascal, eh?",
  "31401": "You approve of him?",
  "31402": "And what was it that had suggested the tremendous tumult?",
  "31403": "Who subscribes?",
  "31404": "There is a room for me?",
  "31405": "Tom, you naughty boy, where's your sister?",

  "31407": "And you are to go down at twelve?",
  "31408": "When again shall such infantile transparency be mine?",
  "31409": "But, first, how would you have 'em served here?",
  "31410": "But what was the matter with the old lumber nag?",
  "31411": "Or why is it suggested that three or four confederacies would be better than one?",
  "31412": "And you climb up?",
  "31413": "Who else could compare my brother's baby with your boy?",
  "31414": "Will it not be more safe, as well as more simple, to dismiss such vague and uncertain calculations, to examine each power by itself, and to decide, on general principles, where it may be deposited with most advantage and least inconvenience?",
  "31415": "As upon her lips, does she mean?",
  "31416": "You ?",
  "31417": "Why not be casual, drifting along, taking all for what it was worth?",

  "31460": "How do you need money?",
  "31461": "And you are not a pining outcast amongst strangers?",
  "31462": "And why should you not do it?",
  "31463": "May we wait again to talk of it till she has done so?",
  "31464": "And what position will you adopt toward the government?",
  "31465": "Conscientiously?",
  "31466": "At what place?",
  "31467": "Or take revenge?",
  "31468": "So you intend to hinder us in our work, my daughter?",
  "31469": "And you know that, do you?",
  "31470": "Do you dance, count?",
  "31471": "Your pardon?",

  "31480": "Tell me whose daughter she is, and of what lineage?",
  "31481": "What is to come of it all?",
  "31482": "Until you come to me I must not try to come to you?",
  "31483": "So it seems you're a hero, eh?",
  "31484": "Where were the traces of her early cares, her sufferings, and fatigues?",
  "31485": "What, my love, is the bearing of your remark?",
  "31486": "What is absorbing you?",
  "31487": "Have you ever seen a woman going mad, monsieur?",
  "31488": "Will you do this?",

  "32273": "Would exasperation, however, if relief had longer been postponed, finally have betrayed me?",
  "32274": "What did I mean by asking questions?",
  "32275": "Will you dance with me?",
  "32276": "Can you dive?",
  "32277": "More rabbits?",
  "32278": "For this?",
  "32279": "Was there any connection between the commotion of the atmosphere and that of the interior of the earth?",
  "32280": "A merry going forth bringeth often a sorrowful return, and a merry evening maketh a sad morning?",
  "32281": "And even of what he knew, how much could he make his untravelled friend either apprehend or believe?",
  "32282": "When did you enter the room?",
  "32283": "Whom have I to live for?",
  "32284": "Going to lose her?",
  "32285": "And may we be so bold as to affirm that there are also many criminals to be found in them, rogues who have stings, and whom the authorities are careful to restrain by force?",
  "32286": "For such matters?",
  "32287": "And do you object to going through the village?",
  "32288": "What do you think of that figure there?",
  "32289": "To how many people can any one tell all?",
  "32290": "Could a body hypocritically take there a small hypocritical touch?",
  "32291": "How have they made me a victim?",
  "32292": "But where can he be?",
  "32293": "How am I?",

  "32301": "Was it not necessary for the good of the state and the interests of the young king, that you should live in good intelligence with the queen?",
  "32302": "What could be the meaning of his sudden change toward me?",
  "32303": "He warned you to abandon your visit?",
  "32304": "Did you really come to propose to me?",
  "32305": "And then, you ungrateful being, you are not pleased to see an old friend?",
  "32306": "Will you return to this gang of robbers, and to this man, when a word can save you?",
  "32307": "Because of the money?",
  "32308": "Who could place my feet on the right path, and bring me back to my company?",
  "32309": "Why did you pull the curtain over the place to make me think you were still there?",

  "32311": "What is the reason?",
  "32312": "Money is no object?",
  "32313": "Where, then, could the driver be, unless he were inside the house?",
  "32314": "Nay, has not a little rationality exposed many women to the severest censure?",
  "32315": "Was that all right?",
  "32316": "What is it?",
  "32317": "Why is the ardour of youth thus to be damped, and the luxuriancy of fancy cut to the quick?",
  "32318": "If there be no distinction between the pleasing and the disgusting, why does it accept the one or reject the other?",
  "32319": "How is that?",
  "32320": "What consolation does the poor suffering soul find in the superb coffin, in the splendid funeral?",
  "32321": "And what am I myself?",

  "32333": "Ye higher men, what think ye?",
  "32334": "Are there many of them?",
  "32335": "I am now among princes like myself, am I not?",
  "32336": "What do you mean by tetragones?",
  "32337": "And you have been in the choir in pursuance of your duties?",
  "32338": "If all is well, why go to the lodge?",
  "32339": "None?",
  "32340": "In displaying anxiety for the breath of which he was at present so willing to get rid, might I not lay myself open to the exactions of his avarice?",
  "32341": "By what path did you get thither?",
  "32342": "Can we get behind his track so that they may smell it?",
  "32343": "You have how many new suits?",
  "32344": "How far mus go up, massa?",
  "32345": "Where's that?",
  "32346": "Is she discouraged, does she drag herself about the house and find fault with everything?",
  "32347": "What whole thing?",
  "32348": "Since it was your intention to live alone, why did you throw into the sea the document which put us on your track?",
  "32349": "If this were human life, if these were human beings, living in a complete world, then what was her own world, outside?",
  "32350": "We are at peace and, why then, should they harm us?",
  "32351": "Then you believe the papers?",
  "32352": "What must I do, officer?",
  "32353": "What do you like to talk about?",
  "32354": "Getting a bit hot, eh?",
  "32355": "If she had wished it, would she not have sent to me by this time?",
  "32356": "Or whom oppose?",
  "32357": "Was it, when he set his heart upon it?",
  "32358": "You, who refuse to tell me the slightest thing?",
  "32359": "Where's mama?",
  "32360": "Are we in any great danger?",
  "32361": "Or will a reaction set in which may arrest progress and even undo much that has been done?",
  "32362": "You are only responsible for my body, is it not so?",
  "32363": "But for this imaginary resistance, officially announced, how would it have been possible to justify the spoliations and exactions which ensued?",
  "32364": "How can you deliberately get up such paltry falsehoods?",
  "32365": "Afterwards to me?",
  "32366": "Carries a bag?",
  "32367": "Shall you not all help me?",
  "32368": "What signified the terms to them, so long as we obtained the actual surrender of people who only wanted a good opportunity to give up gracefully?",
  "32369": "Shall I cut it out?",
  "32370": "Would not the doing of this be your best mode of counteracting his raid on your communications?",
  "32371": "After dinner, eh?",
  "32372": "Well, what, my dear girl?",
  "32373": "What would they say if I did not go?",
  "32374": "But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?",
  "32375": "But to what in the world?",
  "32376": "By your leave, do you know me, sir?",
  "32377": "He will be ruined, you mean?",
  "32378": "What of the prisoner?",
  "32379": "Do you not see that by its solidification, it would burst through this field of ice that imprisons us, as, when it freezes, it bursts the hardest stones?",
  "32380": "Then it appears there will be an opposition, and the enterprise will be disputed?",

  "32382": "Will you dine with me?",
  "32383": "Does he ever come back to this neighborhood?",
  "32384": "And, if ignorance of everything which it is needful a ruler should know is likely to do so much harm in the governing classes of the future, why is it, they ask reasonably enough, that such ignorance in the governing classes of the past has not been viewed with equal horror?",

  "32386": "Do you fear their finding it here, should they come to search?",
  "32387": "Whither are they going?",
  "32388": "What is it, now?",
  "32389": "Was it a thicket?",
  "32390": "Was this the beginning of a happy change?",
  "32391": "Sir, may I have a few words with you concerning some business I have just decided upon?",
  "32392": "But where are you really going?",
  "32393": "What am dat?",
  "32394": "I hope there is no reason to distrust his fidelity?",
  "32395": "Of twelve rowers?",

  "32398": "How does it happen that the presence of a woman overwhelms us so?",
  "32399": "Which do you know?",
  "32400": "You ask me what I will do?",
  "32401": "Then, surely, you will not object to lend it to us?",
  "32402": "What of him?",
  "32403": "And do you know what has become of him?",
  "32404": "Can you tell me, please, who is his favourite actor?",
  "32405": "What more could I hope to do by prolonging the interview?",
  "32406": "Pierced?",
  "32407": "What do you expect to get?",
  "32408": "Besides, was he not in the secret?",
  "32409": "Was it of any use to explain?",
  "32410": "How's the rheumatics?",
  "32411": "But where can one go?",
  "32412": "Where am I?",
  "32413": "Was it after all true that she had been conducting herself in a way that justified the world in thinking that she liked the man?",
  "32414": "And, pray, who are you yourself?",
  "32415": "Is it possible for such a reason?",
  "32416": "Oh, how could we, on your money?",
  "32417": "Why should I give you courage?",
  "32418": "And how much have you got?",
  "32419": "How are you, young man?",
  "32420": "Chillip?",
  "32421": "I say, why are you so late?",
  "32422": "Will the job suit you?",
  "32423": "And who charges me with this, monseigneur?",
  "32424": "Shall I go on?",
  "32425": "To what do they seem to you to be like?",
  "32426": "And how stands the total?",
  "32427": "And did they not leave him on the south side of the river, with their prisoners, while they have gone foolishly on the north?",
  "32428": "Or spiders?",
  "32429": "But you receive him at your house?",
  "32430": "Was there a human agency in the matter?",
  "32431": "And what is the coachman like?",
  "32432": "Have we beheld demons?",
  "32433": "What is his religious doctrine to me, if he carries some good notions along with it?",
  "32434": "And when will that be, father?",
  "32435": "Who could have told her?",
  "32436": "That's it?",
  "32437": "How can I describe my sensations on beholding it?",
  "32438": "What can it be that has this double power?",
  "32439": "And yet you have sent for me?",
  "32440": "Why does a chicken cross the road?",
  "32441": "Who's got the job?",
  "32442": "Is she pretty?",

  "32444": "Shall I fire my rifle off and scare him?",
  "32445": "Have you ever told a lie?",
  "32446": "You have seen it on dozens of girls, and you never found out that it was pretty till now?",
  "32447": "What, the whole property there?",
  "32448": "Is it so important to you?",
  "32449": "What fiend possesses you to stare back at me, continually, with those infernal eyes?",
  "32450": "Even in the country do we get any rest?",
  "32451": "What is it, my friend?",
  "32452": "Why calls my friend?",
  "32453": "Were you examined at an inquest?",
  "32454": "How do they love it dressed?",
  "32455": "How can they get loose when there's a guard over them, ready to shoot them down if they move a peg?",
  "32456": "Your husband, then, is at last dead?",
  "32457": "Pillage?",
  "32458": "Is everyone all right?",
  "32459": "What do you say of this?",
  "32460": "Which do YOU think it was?",
  "32461": "Why is that gendarme there?",
  "32462": "Is it because I am not clean, and my clothes are all in rags, and because I am obliged to go begging about after the manner of tramps and beggars generally?",

  "32469": "You are not going out, I hope?",
  "32470": "If a man with a broad basis of popular support like that was proposing to entertain a duke, surely there could be no doubt about his motives?",
  "32471": "Was he blind?",
  "32472": "Does your majesty grant me this?",
  "32473": "Where was the horse?",

  "32478": "I hoped it was true?",
  "32479": "After?",
  "32480": "Why will you not grant my last wish?",
  "32481": "Do you pay taxes to an agent that he may destroy your property?",
  "32482": "He would have to fly, and where?",
  "32483": "In a figurative sense, how far, and to what offences, may it be extended?",
  "32484": "And what do you think of him?",
  "32485": "The register of my child's birth?",
  "32486": "Was there one exception, and that one he who needed to have been most happy?",

  "32489": "The peasants are ruined?",
  "32490": "Who but a billionaire could say what was fair exchange for a billion?",
  "32491": "Two pounds, and you bring it back?",
  "32492": "What natural force could have produced such plants, and what must have been the appearance of the earth in the first ages of its formation, when, under the action of heat and moisture, the vegetable kingdom alone was developing on its surface?",
  "32493": "You love me just a little, then, marquise?",
  "32494": "Why are you virtuous?",
  "32495": "Are you far gone with a fool?",
  "32496": "How can a man conceal his character?",
  "32497": "What should I do?",
  "32498": "Is that all?",
  "32499": "Who, sire?",
  "32500": "I think I am a philosopher, perhaps, and who knows, perhaps I do wish to teach my views of things to those I meet with?",
  "32501": "Do I seem one to fear for myself?",
  "32502": "But suppose you've bitten a specky bit by accident?",
  "32503": "But where do they sleep?",
  "32504": "You have seen him, then?",
  "32505": "But, just what did the genewal tell you?",
  "32506": "There's nothing to keep you, is there?",
  "32507": "Nicholas, when when did you break your cameo?",
  "32508": "D'you remember the last time we met?",
  "32509": "What hope could there have been for him then?",
  "32510": "You have no mother?",
  "32511": "Outside of a private car?",
  "32512": "And what was this spring of the floor under his feet to the dizzy eccentric lurch with which in the old time the trembling ship yielded to the beat of staggering billows, drunk with their power?",
  "32513": "How is she ever to do better?",
  "32514": "You had heard that there was an execution in the house?",
  "32515": "Can you see where he has put his rifle or his bow?",
  "32516": "But who the deuce is he following?",
  "32517": "Are not necessary pleasures those of which we cannot get rid, and of which the satisfaction is a benefit to us?",
  "32518": "Can they understand or explain even their own characters?",
  "32519": "And why so?",
  "32520": "Is he a good doctor, my love?",
  "32521": "And where is your lodging?",
  "32522": "I hope, my dear friend, you will carry out your father's wish?",
  "32523": "You have knocked at all doors?",
  "32524": "Old man, how goes?",
  "32525": "But what could he have to do with this old family custom of ours, and what does this rigmarole mean?",
  "32526": "Will you take my arm, sir?",
  "32527": "Is it in my character?",
  "32528": "Uncle, what wood is this?",
  "32529": "Well, what did he say then?",
  "32530": "There they were, the words, and what did she want more?",

  "32533": "How dare you grin at me like that?",
  "32534": "Who will make me that summons?",
  "32535": "Especially with copper toes?",
  "32536": "Was it the effect of the lunar rays?",
  "32537": "What have you said?",
  "32538": "You never find he slights his work when your back is turned?",
  "32539": "Perhaps you would like to pay interest?",
  "32540": "Which is she?",
  "32541": "Is that any reason why we should propose to preserve it for ever in a condition of tutelage?",
  "32542": "And my walking up and down for three hours from the table to the stove?",
  "32543": "Not chops?",
  "32544": "Would he choose the peers, for example?",
  "32545": "Why, how are you?",
  "32546": "Who persuaded them into letting him see if he could drive?",
  "32547": "Do you think you can behead me with a single blow?",
  "32548": "Where is the letter?",
  "32549": "Poor old who?",
  "32550": "Me?",
  "32551": "Do you know this person?",

  "32554": "Your birthday?",
  "32555": "What have your family got to do with it?",
  "32556": "How much do I get?",
  "32557": "But may he not change and transform himself?",
  "32558": "It is not so?",
  "32559": "Then I shall really have them?",
  "32560": "So you go back from your promise?",
  "32561": "May she?",
  "32562": "Do you remember what I said when you asked me what I should do if I won all the pots I set my heart on and came through alive?",
  "32563": "Is it too great?",
  "32564": "At it again, hey?",
  "32565": "Which was it?",
  "32566": "Do you believe in presentiments and superstitions?",
  "32567": "Are you now satisfied?",
  "32568": "Your success too?",
  "32569": "The bandits whom the abbe keeps in pay and drink have their useful side, have they?",
  "32570": "Can a man who listens to these three counsellors be sure that he is right in a given decision?",
  "32571": "Have we not perfectly understood each other?",
  "32572": "There is a good postal service, I suppose?",
  "32573": "Comes it in there?",
  "32574": "Tell us now, at once, what you made of the present?",
  "32575": "What is popular sovereignty?",
  "32576": "Do you think we are sure to come out of the wilderness?",
  "32577": "How hang your pouches?",
  "32578": "Should you like to be her boatman?",
  "32579": "How did I survive and surmount such wounds?",
  "32580": "How often we sin, how much we deceive, and all for what?",
  "32581": "Will soon what?",
  "32582": "And we recognize also that this absolute equality has only been known, and can only be known, through the medium of sight or touch, or of some other of the senses, which are all alike in this respect?",
  "32583": "Know you anything of your own family at that time?",
  "32584": "And from a noble client?",
  "32585": "So that, in fact, you have never learned or heard anything in particular?",
  "32586": "What was said or done?",
  "32587": "And where will your worship drink?",
  "32588": "How is it that you have no friends in your prosperity when you had many in adversity?",
  "32589": "King's attorney?",
  "32590": "What could they think indeed?",
  "32591": "HERE?",
  "32592": "If he were in love with the lady?",
  "32593": "Why does she come so close?",
  "32594": "And will he be the better for that?",
  "32595": "What's the matter with your nose, there?",
  "32596": "Now I ax what have they to show for their three months' setting?",
  "32597": "Cherries?",
  "32598": "How are we to know them if we do find them?",
  "32599": "What about the other girl, the one you decoyed away over a week ago?",
  "32600": "How could she not be happy?",
  "32601": "It has been a delightful evening, has it not?",
  "32602": "And now, doctor, what are we to do about money?",
  "32603": "Had they not searched exactly where the document stated?",
  "32604": "How you like it, hey, ole sport?",
  "32605": "But what human language can adequately portray that astonishment, that horror which possessed me at the spectacle then presented to view?",
  "32606": "At best, might not a man in the water lose all his power of direction, and so move in an endless circle until he sank exhausted?",
  "32607": "Does his wife know of it?",
  "32608": "And what is the solar heat?",
  "32609": "If any one were to come in, my dear boy?",
  "32610": "Has your grace taken the precaution to come out in a good stout pair of boots?",

  "32629": "The one in the dark blue coat?",
  "32630": "Want any?",
  "32631": "But why?",
  "32632": "And could it be believed that it at last seems to us as if the problem had never been propounded before, as if we were the first to discern it, get a sight of it, and RISK RAISING it?",
  "32633": "If you come to that, it's hardly my place to be flung out of the flat like this and have to go to an hotel, what?",
  "32634": "Will you open, yes or no?",
  "32635": "If so, on what does your constitution rest?",

  "32651": "Do the footmen kiss her?",
  "32652": "But why does she lie on a sofa?",
  "32653": "What answer was sent?",
  "32654": "What, billing, exchanging stolen glances and broken murmurs?",
  "32655": "Who would not prefer that possibility to the unceasing agitations and frequent revolutions which are the continual scourges of petty republics?",
  "32656": "But what's this?",
  "32657": "What vapour is that?",
  "32658": "Look at that medder, beant it lovely?",
  "32659": "Who would undertake to feed such an enormous multitude?",
  "32660": "By the way, would you mind lending me your matches?",
  "32661": "How could she, a woman, not yet bereft of youth or charms, live alone in the forest, among a troop of soldiers?",
  "32662": "Could he expect that her friends would not step forward?",
  "32663": "Where's my cousin?",
  "32664": "What's the price?",
  "32665": "Fur lined?",
  "32666": "What are they to do?",
  "32667": "Why, how can it be just to beat a father?",
  "32668": "What, are you crossing of yourself?",
  "32669": "But are you not afraid to leave the horse in his power now, since he has every interest in injuring it?",
  "32670": "Why did you come, then?",
  "32671": "What was the abbe's name?",
  "32672": "Never see you again?",
  "32673": "Would the lock click at the end of those seemingly interminable intervals of time?",
  "32674": "Comes he not?",
  "32675": "Why am I left here alone?",
  "32676": "Do you mean to say you think we are going to have bad weather?",
  "32677": "But who attributes to the animals a belief that the phenomena of nature are worked by a multitude of invisible animals or by one enormous and prodigiously strong animal behind the scenes?",
  "32678": "Why were these prisoners not disarmed?",
  "32679": "Why is there this difference?",
  "32680": "You must surely also have been married?",
  "32681": "Why did not he attack at once?",
  "32682": "Were the shutters closed?",
  "32683": "Camels?",
  "32684": "What are you afraid of, prince?",
  "32685": "What more COULD it be?",
  "32686": "Carmarthen?",
  "32687": "Cannot we do anything to put an end to it?",
  "32688": "Do you find me of sufficient rank to do me the honor of crossing swords with me?",
  "32689": "And what shall I say of his virtues?",
  "32690": "What can you expect?",
  "32691": "Are you a patriot?",
  "32692": "Whom do you speak of?",
  "32693": "You will write to her in a day or two?",
  "32694": "Ha, lady?",
  "32695": "Do you want to be let in?",
  "32696": "Was it her character, or her mind, or her nature?",
  "32697": "What is the matter, love?",
  "32698": "What could he be looking for on that immense expanse?",
  "32699": "And how the deuce could I, even if I knew every girl in the place?",
  "32700": "But would she pass on, or would she put into port?",
  "32701": "You looked into the cellars?",
  "32702": "How could you be so rude, so mean, and cruel to us both?",
  "32703": "Was not the selection of the male guardians determined by differences of this sort?",
  "32704": "Why, who do you think this is?",
  "32705": "Is that his design in settling here?",
  "32706": "You teach in it yourself?",
  "32707": "But how did it originate?",
  "32708": "What in the world, between them, ever took place?",
  "32709": "Where does the needle and thread come from?",
  "32710": "But what was that?",
  "32711": "Do you not think that, in putting it as you have done, you have been unjust?",
  "32712": "Do you wish to assassinate a man who, in the eyes of heaven, is a brother?",
  "32713": "Did she know where her husband was?",
  "32714": "Then you'll go?",
  "32715": "Under the bed, are you, hussy?",
  "32716": "Have no society, no neighbors?",
  "32717": "And if I do my duty and do right, you will sustain me, will you not?",
  "32718": "Perhaps he condoles with me, does he?",
  "32719": "Who are these builded for, my son?",
  "32720": "Affords this art no greater miracle?",
  "32721": "Well, then, what do you propose to do?",
  "32722": "You saw the lady fall?",
  "32723": "Do you think as it could be a rabbit?",
  "32724": "But how did you get to work again?",
  "32725": "Would it not, moreover, be much more easy for him to gain his daughter, if he did all in his power to forward his father's views?",
  "32726": "And in what way does he who thinks that wisdom is the discernment of the tempers and tastes of the motley multitude, whether in painting or music, or, finally, in politics, differ from him whom I have been describing?",
  "32727": "What man could be more lovable than such a man as would grow from such a boy?",
  "32728": "Why should not we also enjoy an original relation to the universe?",
  "32729": "Are you thinking I'm safe?",
  "32730": "Well, what of it?",
  "32731": "What's he up to now, I wonder?",
  "32732": "What do you keep on doing it for?",
  "32733": "Did you receive the despatch?",
  "32734": "He is living?",
  "32735": "Shall I really tell you?",
  "32736": "What will our friends think of us, who may chance to be upon the street and witness our frivolous antics?",
  "32737": "Or a subjugator?",
  "32738": "How long have you been married?",
  "32739": "Yet who is there does not sometimes hazard it for the enjoyment of an hour?",
  "32740": "Now for what, my dear friend?",
  "32741": "You will promise me that, at any rate?",
  "32742": "What was their languid grace but the softness of chambering?",
  "32743": "Was it not natural that, in the indignation excited by their wrongs, they should turn to the man who had laid the axe to the root of the tree which bore such fruit, and at least consider the possibility of profiting by his work?",
  "32744": "Could I count them on my fingers?",
  "32745": "May I come in?",
  "32746": "Are you for the rich or for the poor?",
  "32747": "Whose is he?",
  "32748": "Who has been telling you about him?",
  "32749": "Have you nothing else to tell him?",
  "32750": "Worse?",
  "32751": "What would the best of us be if he were suddenly placed at war with the whole world?",
  "32752": "Who is your man?",
  "32753": "Where is he now?",
  "32754": "What are you bothering for?",
  "32755": "Do you seek any guidance from me?",
  "32756": "How on earth should she talk of any one else as long as you are here?",
  "32757": "And a narrative it remains both in the speeches which the poet recites from time to time and in the intermediate passages?",
  "32758": "And others say even that the external world is the work of our organs?",
  "32759": "Am I sorry?",
  "32760": "And, indeed, unless this shoal had a machine in its stomach, how could it change its position with such astonishing rapidity?",
  "32761": "Could the prisoners see each other?",
  "32762": "But why do you ask?",
  "32763": "Are you quite sure, then, that you WILL come to see him often?",
  "32764": "Till then, will you be one, sir?",
  "32765": "And will you undertake to deliver it?",
  "32766": "Well, did you like it?",
  "32767": "Where is my aunt?",
  "32768": "You are horrified?",
  "32769": "Who can say where the dominion of mind over matter ceases?",
  "32770": "But if you think all servitude intolerable, to what purpose serve your complaint against your particular governors?",
  "32771": "If he were so delighted by my visit, why had he not crossed the lawn at once as soon as he saw the car?",
  "32772": "What odds then?",
  "32773": "But what shall it be?",
  "32774": "What do you think of that for a kite?",
  "32775": "Oh, it comes out, then, in the photograph?",
  "32776": "Who denies it?",
  "32777": "Will you give me some money?",
  "32778": "Do you love me so much, then?",
  "32779": "Were you there?",
  "32780": "Why so dull and mute, young sinner?",
  "32781": "But he paid your ransom?",
  "32782": "And how is your sister?",
  "32783": "Whear the divil?",
  "32784": "When you shall have taken this money back to your prince, what advice will you give him?",
  "32785": "Is that the way you talk?",
  "32786": "Where the baker who, retiring from business, leaves his customers and his establishment to his assistants?",
  "32787": "Well what is WHOM?",
  "32788": "No bad?",
  "32789": "How can they be helped, mama?",
  "32790": "And is not their humanity to the condemned in some cases quite charming?",
  "32791": "Is it not because they have not enough at home wherewith to fill their bellies and their pokes?",
  "32792": "You suppose they really TALK of them?",
  "32793": "Do you know, my husband, why I came here?",
  "32794": "What, was it conscience then?",
  "32795": "Why has fate given you two such splendid children?",
  "32796": "It is a good sight to see, I suppose?",
  "32797": "Salted them on me?",
  "32798": "What are you by trade?",
  "32799": "Now, are you ready?",
  "32800": "I wanted to know if, loving her and wishing her happiness, you would consider it good for her to marry me?",
  "32801": "Where are you bound?",
  "32802": "Has he been moved?",
  "32803": "Or shall we not establish our equality in this manner?",
  "32804": "Why had he come to this house?",
  "32805": "What are you going on in this way at me for?",
  "32806": "And if that is true, what sort of general must he have been?",
  "32807": "What's the case now?",
  "32808": "Why may I not rest me from this restlessness and sleep from this wide waking?",
  "32809": "And do you know this gentleman, monsieur?",
  "32810": "Presently?",
  "32811": "Then I have been your property, have I?",
  "32812": "Is that really the case?",
  "32813": "Are the passes open?",
  "32814": "To go to the bottom?",
  "32815": "If you are going into the operations of commerce who will look after the government?",
  "32816": "What strength had I to dart retaliation at my antagonist?",
  "32817": "Have you seen him?",
  "32818": "And why should we have done it?",
  "32819": "Do you hear that flourish of trumpets?",
  "32820": "How long shall I be your victim?",
  "32821": "What on earth put that into her head?",
  "32822": "And when shall you come back again?",
  "32823": "You say the affair was decisive?",
  "32824": "And how did he make his money?",
  "32825": "Mamma?",
  "32826": "What do you expect me to do?",
  "32827": "Who do you suppose, my dear?",
  "32828": "About my what?",
  "32829": "So you understand the whole position of our troops?",
  "32830": "How want of love tormenteth?",

  "32834": "Are you going to sit snoring there, all day?",
  "32835": "Does he mean that?",
  "32836": "But what do we do?",
  "32837": "You have no doubt of their reality?",
  "32838": "Is my father here?",
  "32839": "You still bear in mind what it means?",
  "32840": "And there you sit, I suppose, all the day long, eh?",
  "32841": "Why, as to improvements, magnify the evil, and stoutly refuse to see any good in them?",
  "32842": "From the earth, in the sky?",
  "32843": "If you shall be a cuckold?",
  "32844": "And the unjust man will strive and struggle to obtain more than the unjust man or action, in order that he may have more than all?",
  "32845": "Why did not you kick him out, and let her in, and say I'll be an honest wife and a noble woman from this hour?",
  "32846": "What, all five out at once?",
  "32847": "Do you think that there is anything so very unnatural or inexcusable in their case?",
  "32848": "What else should I have done?",
  "32849": "And know you the news?",
  "32850": "As lovely as WHO?",
  "32851": "What route must we take?",
  "32852": "And not play too?",
  "32853": "What did she say?",
  "32854": "Was the skull nailed to the limb with the face outwards, or with the face to the limb?",
  "32855": "Could you decide now?",
  "32856": "Made to be amused only?",
  "32857": "And what other wretchedness would come to him?",
  "32858": "You have never heard of papa, I suppose?",
  "32859": "What's to become of you out here?",
  "32860": "Where is he then?",
  "32861": "Now what horrible thing can have happened?",
  "32862": "What has he heard?",
  "32863": "We are both undone, and what better are we for our being reconciled together, seeing we have nothing to live on?",
  "32864": "Should he sacrifice more men, with so few chances of saving those already sacrificed?",
  "32865": "Have you not yourself already had the same fear?",
  "32866": "Have the men taken cover?",
  "32867": "Does he weep?",
  "32868": "Are they all brothers, sir?",
  "32869": "Should he find an issue?",
  "32870": "What's the use of our trying to do anything, trying to know anything, trying to be anything?",
  "32871": "What could be better than to combine these accounts, and make up a complete narrative from them all?",
  "32872": "You pledge yourself to that, marshal?",

  "32874": "Say, does my arrow miss or hit the mark?",
  "32875": "From whom did he inherit them?",
  "32876": "What did you say her address was?",
  "32877": "How can we be reconciled?",
  "32878": "Shall I marry and settle down?",
  "32879": "But was he ill?",
  "32880": "How, indeed, could a lasting concord be maintained by two such disparate characters?",
  "32881": "Is THAT spiritual, her bullying, her conceit, her sordid materialism?",
  "32882": "Is?",
  "32883": "Would he be regarded as any the less a renegade from all parties?",
  "32884": "Parley?",
  "32885": "Would the discovery not facilitate immensely our dealings with our fellows, suggesting new possibilities of control?",
  "32886": "You think this house pretty, do you not?",
  "32887": "Often, in the midst of his gravest souvenirs, after a day of conflict with the whole diplomacy of the continent, he returned at night to his apartments, and there, exhausted with fatigue, overwhelmed with sleep, what did he do?",
  "32888": "Unreservedly?",
  "32889": "Where does discretion end, and avarice begin?",
  "32890": "And why not you?",
  "32891": "Is it not evident that this gallery was once the way open to the course of the lava, and that at that time there must have been a free passage?",
  "32892": "Why would you?",
  "32893": "And who is the man?",
  "32894": "If we are a bane, why do you marry us?",
  "32895": "Who plucks the bud before one leaf put forth?",

  "32901": "Why, how the deuce can I be more explicit?",
  "32902": "I go out?",
  "32903": "Where was this coach, in the name of gracious?",
  "32904": "With what day shall I begin?",
  "32905": "Horrible to you?",
  "32906": "Was that a command to him to go?",
  "32907": "What should social, intelligent, and free beings have learned from this uncertainty of value?",
  "32908": "What has that got to do with it?",
  "32909": "Will gratitude be sufficient for a heart which knows not two manners of bestowing its affections, and feels itself incapable of everything except friendship?",
  "32910": "Is that so much amiss?",
  "32911": "You adhere to that resolution?",
  "32912": "Did you ever hear any woman speak like her?",
  "32913": "Would your honor let me make another turning?",
  "32914": "Do you keep plate in the house, or anything to attract burglars?",
  "32915": "Can we repair the injuries which it may have done to individuals?",
  "32916": "And is this all?",
  "32917": "What do you ask?",

  "32931": "What did you think the vittles was for?",
  "32932": "Your patronymic?",
  "32933": "Do my ears tell me true?",
  "32934": "Did I mean to say any thing against his character?",
  "32935": "And you would agree that to conceive things as they are is to possess the truth?",
  "32936": "Is it like a whale?",
  "32937": "What use do you make of these men?",
  "32938": "After all, who would have looked for such bitter satire from a creature so young, and so exquisitely beautiful?",
  "32939": "But if we cannot live here any longer, father?",
  "32940": "Who could tell you that?",
  "32941": "But why not?",
  "32942": "Could the hope of being king do it?",
  "32943": "Am I not always to be so?",
  "32944": "Shall we start?",
  "32945": "You laugh, child?",
  "32946": "Tell me then, what part of the world is it that you will sacrifice for my charms?",
  "32947": "But must we go through them?",
  "32948": "The reason for that?",
  "32949": "Were the relations between father and son very friendly?",

  "32956": "But this rascal?",
  "32957": "And you will protect us, who are your children, against the will of my father?",
  "32958": "That was encouraging, you know?",
  "32959": "You will help me to see him if you can?",
  "32960": "Now, why should the whale thus insist upon having his spoutings out, unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air, ere descending for good?",
  "32961": "You do a good deal of business here, I suppose, at this time of the year?",
  "32962": "Can people please each other too much?",
  "32963": "What, you know him, do you?",
  "32964": "Under it, have I said?",
  "32965": "And is not that the commonest infirmity of declining life?",
  "32966": "Trelawney?",
  "32967": "What will get me into trouble?",
  "32968": "That is amiable, is it not?",
  "32969": "But shall you at least get your money back?",
  "32970": "Shall we find a respectable hotel there?",
  "32971": "Confining our discussion to the present moment of existence, let us see how such weak creatures perform their part?",

  "33007": "Does nobody overhear us?",
  "33008": "Whose then?",
  "33009": "Is it not significant that a contact with new ways of thinking has a tendency, at least, to make men broaden their horizon and to revise some of their views?",
  "33010": "Was it respect?",
  "33011": "Do you want my medicine rubbed all over your body?",

  "33036": "How does the fellow manage to love two of them?",
  "33037": "Why cannot we walk outside like the meteor?",
  "33038": "Did perhaps their hearts despond, because lonesomeness had swallowed me like a whale?",
  "33039": "Can there be no mistake?",
  "33040": "Is it something I am not to repeat?",
  "33041": "And the teal, with what shall we cut that up?",
  "33042": "While we are adjusting our relations with the rest of the world is it not of capital importance that we should clear away all grounds of misunderstanding with our immediate neighbors and give proof of the friendship we really feel?",
  "33043": "How is it possible to extort a meaning from all this jargon about 'devil's seats,' 'death's heads,' and 'bishop's hotels?",
  "33044": "When shall I see you again?",
  "33045": "And what may be the ages of these two, ma'am?",
  "33046": "Who, then, would not imagine that such conduct as will inevitably destroy what all are thus labouring to acquire, must generally be avoided?",
  "33047": "Was she going to try to bulldoze him into submission?",
  "33048": "But what about you?",
  "33049": "What's your pleasure, gentlemen?",
  "33050": "Was he as innocent as he looked?",
  "33051": "What did she look like?",
  "33052": "Shall this class of legislation just now beginning with us be general or special?",
  "33053": "Who, my dear?",
  "33054": "And how long will the case last?",
  "33055": "Did he come quiet?",
  "33056": "But ten?",
  "33057": "You surely would not desert her?",
  "33058": "The great stake?",
  "33059": "Are they not our most mortal foes?",
  "33060": "How do you mean to settle this affair?",
  "33061": "Would this misery last for ever?",
  "33062": "Are you really throwing us all over, little mother?",
  "33063": "Someone in a novel, was he not?",
  "33064": "Then why is it done?",
  "33065": "Who can undertake to say that he is not a sham in anything?",
  "33066": "Was it possible for me to proclaim a deficiency in that one sense which in my case ought to have been more perfect than in all others, which I had once possessed in greatest perfection, to a degree of perfection, indeed, which few of my profession have ever enjoyed?",
  "33067": "How are you now?",
  "33068": "Did he understand all those mysterious murmurs which warn or importune the spirit at certain moments of life?",
  "33069": "Has she been presented?",
  "33070": "Is the shipwreck due to the pilot?",
  "33071": "It is all over, is it not?",
  "33072": "He's nice?",
  "33073": "Pretended?",
  "33074": "Are you mixing that other bowl of punch?",
  "33075": "Am I grown?",
  "33076": "What a horrible vision affronted my eyes?",
  "33077": "Would she not allow him to go and wade in the mud?",
  "33078": "The rickety rafters?",
  "33079": "No son?",
  "33080": "Or what are they ornamented with?",
  "33081": "And they are all in for this examination?",
  "33082": "And the ear has an end and an excellence also?",
  "33083": "But why shall we go there?",
  "33084": "You are not angry with me for coming?",
  "33085": "Did you ever see the like of it in your life?",
  "33086": "I trust and hope you never repeated to the count all the foolish remarks we used to make about him?",
  "33087": "Why, let me see, how old are you?",
  "33088": "What else could he do?",
  "33089": "That voice?",
  "33090": "And these men were your friends?",
  "33091": "What better issues could a man want?",
  "33092": "Not to be afraid really to speak?",
  "33093": "I call it a very serious thing, eh?",
  "33094": "Have you any more conditions to offer?",
  "33095": "What time did you start?",
  "33096": "And with what result?",
  "33097": "And now you will be our companion?",
  "33098": "And what is this way?",
  "33099": "Because?",
  "33100": "Which route must I take?",
  "33101": "Now, what is it you say?",
  "33102": "And do you dare look in my face, after that shameful deed?",
  "33103": "Let me ask, sir, what great exploits have you performed?",
  "33104": "Why have you come?",
  "33105": "What wages do you ask?",
  "33106": "But where are they taking her?",
  "33107": "Doing anything now, are you?",
  "33108": "It relates to some great event, then?",
  "33109": "Have you any letters of hers?",
  "33110": "How should any one coming from a wider world not feel the difference and be attracted by it?",
  "33111": "And how is it she has not pride enough to see it?",
  "33112": "Is she feeling the same as I?",
  "33113": "What is his extent?",
  "33114": "Then the truth is too bad to tell?",
  "33115": "Can this be, then?",
  "33116": "Which is your house?",
  "33117": "Where else can he be?",
  "33118": "What should I be but for you?",
  "33119": "Ah, then, you do not love me?",
  "33120": "Many of them?",
  "33121": "Oh, you do, do you?",
  "33122": "And this is a letter, is it?",
  "33123": "How do you get your dinner, then?",
  "33124": "Where shall I find you?",
  "33125": "Will you fight me?",
  "33126": "What do you suppose he meant?",
  "33127": "Do you love me still?",
  "33128": "Which is the way out, please?",
  "33129": "Now, what's your name?",
  "33130": "How can it, by coming quickly into the eyes and ears, distinguish the pleasing from the disgusting in external objects?",
  "33131": "You love it, do you?",
  "33132": "And, yet, how could it be otherwise?",
  "33133": "Why had this agent preserved silence?",
  "33134": "They include, I presume, correspondence?",
  "33135": "How can you not know?",
  "33136": "But how came he to be there?",
  "33137": "Do you wish to destroy me?",
  "33138": "And he who is most skilful in preventing or escaping from a disease is best able to create one?",
  "33139": "What remained to her of primitive virtue?",
  "33140": "This, sir?",
  "33141": "Jo, dear, what is it?",
  "33142": "How would you like to have some tableaux in here?",
  "33143": "With this boy?",
  "33144": "Do you know who I am?",
  "33145": "When I spoke in confidence to your brother, could I regard him as an inquisitor?",
  "33146": "Did you court her for her wealth?",
  "33147": "Have I met you and passed you already, unknowing, unthinking and blind?",
  "33148": "You are acquainted?",
  "33149": "But what would be the use of new continents?",
  "33150": "Have I kept my promise, yes or no?",
  "33151": "There used to be a certain amount of solidity in all things, but now what happens?",
  "33152": "Because I love the court?",
  "33153": "Can one ever tell anyone what one is feeling?",
  "33154": "Who knows how easy it is for ambition to call itself vocation?",
  "33155": "Was it my mother's or my father's act?",
  "33156": "Is this a carelessness, or what?",
  "33157": "Weak?",
  "33158": "Might they not hang him at once, and inquire into his case afterward?",
  "33159": "What do they say?",
  "33160": "Had she really any life of her own behind all her propagandism?",
  "33161": "Do you think this would be the first time a woman had repented of an infidelity?",
  "33162": "Do you think our little girl here need be afraid?",
  "33163": "Can you tell me why you foster the cruel deception?",
  "33164": "What else has the world given me for all that I have done for it?",
  "33165": "And what good will it do you?",
  "33166": "Why joke?",
  "33167": "What is he like, uncle?",
  "33168": "And is not the truest pity, when a man has a sore point, not to touch it at all?",
  "33169": "Are you satisfied?",
  "33170": "Who would hear her?",
  "33171": "Do you not see that they are all giving me the wink, and wanting me to turn you out by force, only I do not like to do so?",
  "33172": "And are you glad to see me?",
  "33173": "And what is the pay?",
  "33174": "Has he now some disciples?",
  "33175": "To sleep?",
  "33176": "What'll it be?",
  "33177": "But a little rakish, hey?",
  "33178": "With friends like that, who needs enemies?",
  "33179": "A bride?",
  "33180": "Or what is become of them?",
  "33181": "Is he indeed, sir?",
  "33182": "He will not talk to me about it, so why should I trouble him?",
  "33183": "But is not your eminence going to the queen?",
  "33184": "At once?",
  "33185": "Will it be long first?",
  "33186": "But am I sure?",
  "33187": "Rita?",
  "33188": "Who took that step?",
  "33189": "What's better in him?",
  "33190": "But why should I make a long story?",
  "33191": "If error is possible there, why not here?",
  "33192": "Nothing else?",
  "33193": "You say 'What are they regarding?",
  "33194": "Have you not left off your impudent pretensions there yet?",
  "33195": "That is all true, then, is it?",
  "33196": "Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary clothes on?",
  "33197": "May we see it now?",
  "33198": "What's to be done?",
  "33199": "Was he the only applicant?",
  "33200": "A man who has paid every penalty for wrong, if wrong there was?",
  "33201": "You surely will not do that, my dear count?",
  "33202": "What did this mean?",
  "33203": "What mysterious thing can this be?",
  "33204": "Well, sir, what is it?",
  "33205": "In what place, captain?",
  "33206": "Then where are the other people?",
  "33207": "Very bad, eh?",
  "33208": "What do you think of this?",
  "33209": "Where is your justification for inflicting all this pain?",
  "33210": "Why should we consider ourselves, men and women, as broken fragments of one whole?",
  "33211": "Is a man who has a sudden attack of pain in tooth or stomach not to be permitted to go to the nearest druggist's shop and ask for something that will relieve him?",
  "33212": "Then, is she dying?",
  "33213": "Are you all right now?",
  "33214": "Where've you hid your letters?",
  "33215": "What is the matter with her?",
  "33216": "And what favor, pray?",
  "33217": "What do you want to have me here for?",
  "33218": "What mad pursuit?",
  "33219": "Why not?",
  "33220": "But what would you have me do, child?",
  "33221": "Had she tried her strength again, what had that availed?",
  "33222": "Do you hear what I say?",
  "33223": "Of what complexion?",
  "33224": "Is she to be shown up to your room?",
  "33225": "And, if I said so, to whom would the place belong?",
  "33226": "If they are not, with what propriety can the like power justify such a charge against the national government, or even be urged as an obstacle to its adoption?",
  "33227": "Is no one about who can get in?",
  "33228": "Will you have brilliants, or a castle by the sea, or, perhaps, a yacht?",
  "33229": "Do they follow us so far?",
  "33230": "But even if one might, what feeling except veneration could such a man as my father evoke?",
  "33231": "Who will give it to me?",
  "33232": "Who is so bold as to do it?",
  "33233": "Why did you come here to find me, then?",
  "33234": "English?",
  "33235": "Can I be always by your side?",
  "33236": "Auntie, what have I done?",
  "33237": "Where's your shells?",
  "33238": "Is it your business, eh?",
  "33239": "Do you see that island?",
  "33240": "You think that she would refuse me?",
  "33241": "Did you sleep badly?",
  "33242": "Is it because we are invited?",
  "33243": "Will you walk a little bit with me?",
  "33244": "Do you deny that you were listening at that door?",
  "33245": "How soon may we hope to get back?",
  "33246": "Is the wind north or south?",
  "33247": "Yet how could he think her capable of deliberately wishing to renew their assignations now?",
  "33248": "Aluminum?",
  "33249": "How could it have been me?",
  "33250": "What makes you say that?",
  "33251": "And who will be the warden of the hospital?",
  "33252": "What's that that has fallen?",
  "33253": "Has judgment been pronounced?",
  "33254": "And who is the criminal?",
  "33255": "Can you row?",
  "33256": "Can he spare you?",
  "33257": "Shall we ever know?",
  "33258": "But who the devil has fortified this paltry little place in this manner?",
  "33259": "Do you remember any case at all like it?",

  "33261": "About me?",
  "33262": "It is then the interest of the enemies of this potentate to secure and publish this letter, so as to make a breach between his country and ours?",
  "33263": "Brooke?",
  "33264": "Is it funny?",
  "33265": "But if so, where was the girl, and what had she done with the papers?",
  "33266": "And you did not know any one else on the train?",
  "33267": "You intend to remain?",
  "33268": "No guarantee?",
  "33269": "Are you asking for a lodger?",
  "33270": "And if it knew, would it dare?",
  "33271": "And what do you call that little metal ruler?",
  "33272": "What is advantage?",
  "33273": "You are not going, papa?",
  "33274": "Is that what you have been trying?",
  "33275": "My little woman, why do you look at me in that way?",
  "33276": "What do you want to say?",
  "33277": "Is yours a long part?",
  "33278": "Gentle?",
  "33279": "What is POLITICS?",
  "33280": "What did their tears imply?",
  "33281": "What shall the court do?",
  "33282": "But what do YOU think?",
  "33283": "If he had not lost his balance, why should he have launched into an almost passionate defence of the physical coward?",
  "33284": "And is it not very rational to conclude, that the women who have not been taught to respect the human nature of their own sex, in these particulars, will not long respect the mere difference of sex, in their husbands?",
  "33285": "What is the object of these questions?",
  "33286": "Oh you're there, are you?",
  "33287": "How much may it amount to?",
  "33288": "Shall I tell him all, then, openly?",
  "33289": "Oswald, have you not your mother to come to the rescue?",
  "33290": "O, do you know me, man?",
  "33291": "And how do you get on with the officers?",
  "33292": "How dare you come when you're not wanted?",
  "33293": "Is it certainly accursed?",
  "33294": "But to do this he must have spoken?",
  "33295": "Have you ever died yet?",
  "33296": "Who would ever suspect me, me, me, especially if I should choose a being I had no interest in doing away with?",
  "33297": "Trust to the sword the fortunes of the world?",
  "33298": "Where is your crown, then?",
  "33299": "And even if there's a delay, how can it alter the end?",
  "33300": "It will not be opened when the hearing is resumed?",
  "33301": "Then what does he do?",
  "33302": "Have the rebels been successful up to this time?",
  "33303": "You saw this?",
  "33304": "You want a serious duel?",
  "33305": "Are not your people dead?",
  "33306": "Will you lose by him, then?",
  "33307": "Kenneth?",
  "33308": "Who could have taken it out?",
  "33309": "Your little share?",
  "33310": "Are you hurt?",
  "33311": "And why be at the charge of providing logic of the best quality, when a very inferior article will be equally acceptable?",
  "33312": "Or rather at what he said?",
  "33313": "Then in what do you intend to be married, unnatural girl?",
  "33314": "Have you nearly concluded your argument?",
  "33315": "What, in short, is his character?",
  "33316": "What's the matter?",
  "33317": "Where can she have come from?",
  "33318": "What's his trade?",
  "33319": "Yet why not?",
  "33320": "Does he not perceive us?",
  "33321": "Has she?",
  "33322": "Who is entitled to the rent of the land?",
  "33323": "Would it not be wise for us to make a change?",
  "33324": "How might he be more brave?",
  "33325": "As, indeed, how should any of those prim and reputable virgins?",
  "33326": "What was that noise about?",
  "33327": "Have you watched?",
  "33328": "Twas shameful, was it not?",
  "33329": "Or is it only because you must?",
  "33330": "Had a bath this morning?",
  "33331": "What shall I say or do?",
  "33332": "Are you then pressed for this money?",
  "33333": "What's that you got?",
  "33334": "Pardon this rascal?",
  "33335": "The sound of the spur?",
  "33336": "Not a civil list?",
  "33337": "Now you laugh?",

  "33346": "The exact sum?",
  "33347": "I JUSTICE, WHETHER A NATURAL OR ARTIFICIAL VIRTUE?",

  "33354": "And if that's the case, what do they mean by wanting me to believe that he is enchanted?",
  "33355": "What are you saying about the militia?",
  "33356": "A horse and two men?",
  "33357": "You will say nothing to me?",

  "33432": "And did it hurt much?",
  "33433": "Do you hear the cracking?",
  "33434": "And who shall silence all the airs and madrigals that whisper softness in chambers?",
  "33435": "Ought I before giving him the slap to say a few words by way of preface?",
  "33436": "And is it settled?",
  "33437": "Where do you get your information from?",
  "33438": "Are you warm, darling?",
  "33439": "What officers?",
  "33440": "Do you intend parting with the little ones, madam?",
  "33441": "But the mark in your hand?",
  "33442": "What right have we human beings to happiness?",
  "33443": "What are you hiding?",
  "33444": "I hope you are pretty well?",
  "33445": "But what did you take?",
  "33446": "What are you trying to suggest?",
  "33447": "So I see, but does it follow that he is your property?",
  "33448": "How dare you stay here when you heard me call?",
  "33449": "But what guarantee have I?",
  "33450": "And why should one ask for advice, who does not expect to gain his health?",
  "33451": "What did you say your name was?",
  "33452": "Who are you?",
  "33453": "Do we?",
  "33454": "What do you mean, sir?",
  "33455": "What else could I think?",
  "33456": "But ask not, to what doctors I apply?",
  "33457": "But does he care for her?",
  "33458": "Are you sure you're well enough?",
  "33459": "What assures me, sir?",
  "33460": "What harm, then, could a man do in the moat?",
  "33461": "Smallweed?",
  "33462": "Does not your heart feel that they imply great earnestness in life?",
  "33463": "Do you ever dream of me?",
  "33464": "Why should you wish to force me to do what I'll willingly do of myself?",
  "33465": "Do you think people, if they had received no injury, would come such a journey only to calumniate your father?",
  "33466": "And do you know how pretty you are, child?",
  "33467": "You are sure of that?",
  "33468": "Why did the five fellows out of the higher line run away for that?",
  "33469": "Was this not indeed a veritable hell, peopled by lost souls, dead and damned beyond all hope?",
  "33470": "Oh, suppose we did, and had to stay out all night?",
  "33471": "A young man?",
  "33472": "Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught?",
  "33473": "Whose prisoner was she?",
  "33474": "Anything more, sir?",
  "33475": "Who can have robbed it of the beauty that gladdened it, of the grace and gaiety that charmed it, of the modesty that shed a lustre upon it?",
  "33476": "But you be glad that you 'm going to marry a gentleman?",
  "33477": "And indeed what does the price matter, if the trick be well done?",
  "33478": "Confound you, have you been rummaging round among my clothes, then?",
  "33479": "Is it wrong to see the beauty of the almond blossoms, wrong to taste the scented wind?",
  "33480": "Do you know how long it would take for an express train to reach the moon?",
  "33481": "Will you tell me how long you have loved him?",
  "33482": "It's breakfast you want, is it?",
  "33483": "You saw the ventilator, too?",
  "33484": "Then you never believed in the principality?",
  "33485": "And is not my brother dead?",
  "33486": "Where is the green door?",
  "33487": "So now we are friends again, are we not?",
  "33488": "Will you three months hence be in a situation to perform the journey more at your ease than at present?",
  "33489": "But is that case could I have expected more from him than from my own brother?",
  "33490": "You say that I am safe and sound?",
  "33491": "How can one think of him as bad?",
  "33492": "How much might that be?",
  "33493": "Is not 'loves' the truer tense?",
  "33494": "Will I not guard, and cherish, and solace her?",
  "33495": "Why did he hesitate?",
  "33496": "You had my note?",
  "33497": "What sorrows?",
  "33498": "The seen is the changing, and the unseen is the unchanging?",
  "33499": "Hope?",
  "33500": "Than follow one who merely withdraws from this one and that one, had you not better follow those who have withdrawn from the world altogether?",
  "33501": "And who has struck the blow?",
  "33502": "Have yo been sowing wheat long?",
  "33503": "Why should one not explore everything, and study everything?",
  "33504": "How long will it take?",
  "33505": "You have heard of the magi, perhaps?",
  "33506": "What does he do for a living?",
  "33507": "What toast?",
  "33508": "Will you bear that in mind, my dear, and always say that it was me that was your friend?",
  "33509": "HOW do you do?",
  "33510": "Why to a poor one most?",
  "33511": "And why would you be so fond to overcome the famous wrestler?",
  "33512": "Will you write a book?",
  "33513": "Was it some incident, some sorrow, that led you to take life vows?",
  "33514": "Are you there?",
  "33515": "Why should he?",
  "33516": "Why make all these excuses?",
  "33517": "How do you like us?",
  "33518": "What make you here?",
  "33519": "Is he quite gone away?",
  "33520": "Well, what do you say, are we going shooting tomorrow?",
  "33521": "Consoled?",
  "33522": "Do you suppose I want to be told where to go?",
  "33523": "Just you and the river, and no one else to pass a word with?",
  "33524": "But did there not exist in the island some animal which might supply the place of the horse, ass, or ox?",
  "33525": "Shall I?",
  "33526": "Did she speak of the man?",
  "33527": "What was to be done?",
  "33528": "You do not care if he does?",
  "33529": "Who was the unknown companion of her dream?",
  "33530": "And what a devil is become of them?",
  "33531": "I wonder whether you remember what I said to you then?",
  "33532": "Did you never hear that from the young girls where you come from in the west or south?",
  "33533": "The night porter saw nothing, I suppose?",
  "33534": "For who can guess?",
  "33535": "And so you think that I ought to answer your indictment as if I were in a court?",
  "33536": "What need they?",
  "33537": "Who?",
  "33538": "Regular people who get you a place?",
  "33539": "Is this a practical joke?",
  "33540": "Why should they ever be afraid to dash up and harry us, when they know full well that they run no greater risk at our hands than if we were stumps in their orchards?",
  "33541": "How do you mean?",
  "33542": "But what's the use of tapping?",
  "33543": "Sweeter unpossess'd, have I said of her my sweetest?",
  "33544": "Could you give my boy and me a lift as far as there?",
  "33545": "Has this cruelly treated girl been able to walk home?",
  "33546": "But you'll keep your word true?",
  "33547": "It really is rather like me, is it not?",
  "33548": "What did he know about its value, or what did any one know?",
  "33549": "Is this second infinity intelligent also?",
  "33550": "What is the good of keeping it?",
  "33551": "And to which?",
  "33552": "But things are mending, perhaps?",
  "33553": "You like them, then?",
  "33554": "Will they establish a censorship to distinguish between men of genius and fools?",
  "33555": "What should I speak?",
  "33556": "How am I to know?",
  "33557": "Well, and what then?",
  "33558": "But who is she?",
  "33559": "What is that, madame?",
  "33560": "And when is he to be married?",
  "33561": "And what are the other teachers called?",
  "33562": "You have had nothing to eat, my pet?",
  "33563": "When do you expect to be here?",
  "33564": "One asked him if he was going to be married?",
  "33565": "What light is that on the hill?",
  "33566": "But where is the girl who owns the throne, and what is her name?",
  "33567": "What have I been cruel to you in?",
  "33568": "What does the hedgehog mean?",
  "33569": "Would your ransom be large enough to cover the cost of a broken church window?",
  "33570": "Is not that wrong?",
  "33571": "Lock?",
  "33572": "How if she will not come?",
  "33573": "What's that you're reading?",
  "33574": "Why have you set upon me in the dark?",
  "33575": "That is your father, is it not?",
  "33576": "What is the voice of history?",
  "33577": "You are setting off, then?",
  "33578": "And he really succeeded?",
  "33579": "You have not heard then of what they are accused?",
  "33580": "Why should he come again?",
  "33581": "What sort of a figure would he make if he escaped?",
  "33582": "Can it be possible?",
  "33583": "How you must have hated me after THAT evening?",
  "33584": "Mary, to me?",
  "33585": "And YOUR cheese, your excellency?",
  "33586": "And yet you saw how she thanked me, with her so beautiful dying eyes, her voice, too, so weak, and she kiss my rough old hand and bless me?",
  "33587": "In what respects?",
  "33588": "Had I caught her off her guard?",
  "33589": "And why does the weight know how to find it by so short a line?",
  "33590": "Can you have any difference with your father?",
  "33591": "Going away, sir?",
  "33592": "What's it about?",
  "33593": "Then it is he whom you suspect?",
  "33594": "What is your rank?",
  "33595": "And ruined her character?",
  "33596": "Why wish to fly till you have got your wings?",
  "33597": "Pretty well?",
  "33598": "The executioner, in short?",
  "33599": "Where the deuce can they have gone?",
  "33600": "A merchant?",
  "33601": "What that you say?",
  "33602": "Does it now only exist in my memory?",
  "33603": "What can I say to him?",
  "33604": "How do I pay my rent?",
  "33605": "Which did she choose?",
  "33606": "May I ask what position she holds in your household?",
  "33607": "What right have we to say that this is the people's will?",
  "33608": "If he was his confederate, why should he carry his photograph?",
  "33609": "Are beauties there as proud as here they be?",
  "33610": "Why, when the body is putrefying?",
  "33611": "And if not, what else did she imagine?",
  "33612": "Were you not, gentlemen, both in the musketeers of the late king?",
  "33613": "How long his he been there?",
  "33614": "What is this oven for?",
  "33615": "Nay, will not such a one often rejoice more than any other in the rich show of outer apparel?",
  "33616": "What does that nonsense mean?",
  "33617": "Would the selfish and the cowardly ever lack reasons for yielding to the enemy?",
  "33618": "Is he at home now?",
  "33619": "Do you see any inconvenience in having an army at the end of a year, instead of two regiments?",
  "33620": "Forgiveness?",
  "33621": "Well, in what case is it just that the tax should take the form of a levy on polls?",
  "33622": "Are they dead or alive?",
  "33623": "Do you know anything of it, fellow?",
  "33624": "What preservation can you now desire after the destruction of your temple?",
  "33625": "And what she said to you?",
  "33626": "Did you want a coffin, sir?",
  "33627": "Did you ever suppose you'd see the day when you'd be adopting an orphan girl?",
  "33628": "I wonder if this can be the person we're looking for?",
  "33629": "First, then, they resemble one another in the value which they set upon wealth?",
  "33630": "What did he repeat to us all the day?",
  "33631": "What are you saying to her?",
  "33632": "You're dancing, are you?",
  "33633": "Hate you, sir?",
  "33634": "Would you know him again?",
  "33635": "If I consent to announce you, may I at least know whom to announce, monsieur?",
  "33636": "What's wrong with my face?",
  "33637": "Had that begun in your time?",
  "33638": "Never been there?",
  "33639": "Is he not in love?",
  "33640": "What did she answer?",
  "33641": "Do you dare to say that I am not right?",
  "33642": "What are the facts?",
  "33643": "Somebody has called?",
  "33644": "What use will peace be when he is no longer here?",
  "33645": "Unable to grasp any thing great, is it surprising that they find the reading of history a very dry task, and disquisitions addressed to the understanding, intolerably tedious, and almost unintelligible?",
  "33646": "The inhabitants of the island and the sailors?",
  "33647": "You've got a mark upon you somewheres or another, I suppose?",
  "33648": "Where are all the listeners and spies who accompany the queen?",
  "33649": "What is this gnawing of conscience I am feeling now?",
  "33650": "What, are they gone, sirs?",
  "33651": "Whom the deuce can it be from?",
  "33652": "Need there now be any secrets between us?",
  "33653": "Was not he sent for?",
  "33654": "When was it received?",
  "33655": "But why on earth should you be pursued with such animosity?",
  "33656": "Further, there can be no doubt that a work is spoilt when not done at the right time?",
  "33657": "What is it in your hand?",
  "33658": "What arrangement, squire?",
  "33659": "Do you remember that I paid it you ten days later, and you put it at the bottom of the tobacco?",
  "33660": "Did he mention the precise order of occupation to which he would addict himself?",
  "33661": "But be seated, and tell us now what is the cause of your docility?",
  "33662": "What the devil right have you to interfere?",
  "33663": "Has he decided to do so?",
  "33664": "And with how many fingers does he bless?",
  "33665": "Do you think I cannot see?",
  "33666": "If I preserve my purity in the society of the trees, why should he who would have me preserve it among men, seek to rob me of it?",
  "33667": "What had happened to bring this shocking change about?",
  "33668": "DID you see all the diamonds those ladies wore?",
  "33669": "How is that?",
  "33670": "With that?",
  "33671": "Did you recognize?",
  "33672": "What have we done, what has this poor thing done, that we are so sore beset?",
  "33673": "Must hate and death return?",
  "33674": "Why not view it often by faith?",
  "33675": "They are not fit for me, are they?",
  "33676": "Any lazy idle loafers that want flogging in this class?",
  "33677": "Why, then, do I not hear them?",
  "33678": "Do you accept my solution of the mystery?",
  "33679": "Not one year, madame?",
  "33680": "Was it right or wrong?",
  "33681": "Have you understood how our dog was so strangely thrown up out of the water of the lake, after his struggle with the dugong?",
  "33682": "How have you defended me?",
  "33683": "What are their sufferings?",
  "33684": "How about the widows and orphans confided to you?",
  "33685": "What have you got to do with the dew, ma'am?",
  "33686": "Is life to be purchased by such a sacrifice?",
  "33687": "What tell you me of fasting days?",
  "33688": "And have the children looked after themselves at all, sir?",
  "33689": "A dress for you, also, is it not, my friend?",
  "33690": "Coavinses?",
  "33691": "Had we a river, a lake, a sea to depend upon?",
  "33692": "But nobody possesses it, so what would you have?",
  "33693": "You have made it up?",
  "33694": "When is it to be done?",
  "33695": "How, then, could they provide for themselves, and when had they time to plough and sow their fields?",
  "33696": "Was her husband, to whom it legally belonged, to make it over to her as a free gift?",
  "33697": "Is what you hear at church, religion?",
  "33698": "And what enlargement do you expect to obtain in this way?",
  "33699": "Plans?",
  "33700": "What might be the consequences?",
  "33701": "Would she have pitied him had she seen him?",
  "33702": "Aronnax?",
  "33703": "In your own heart, do you feel quite certain?",
  "33704": "Or you, my lords, to be my followers?",
  "33705": "It is true?",
  "33706": "Then in time of peace justice will be of no use?",
  "33707": "But how could you guess what the motive was?",
  "33708": "What did you think of that?",
  "33709": "When will you come?",
  "33710": "Is it possible, then, to love, if you are not loved?",
  "33711": "Will you be her servants?",
  "33712": "Would she never issue from it?",
  "33713": "There's nothing wrong?",
  "33714": "NOT a party in anything, ma'am?",
  "33715": "Have I cut my heart into a demd extraordinary number of little pieces, and given them all away, one after another, to the same little engrossing demnition captivater, and can I live to be suspected by her?",
  "33716": "Then what?",
  "33717": "Supper?",
  "33718": "Can anyone do much for anyone else unless by making a will in his favour and dying then and there?",
  "33719": "Did we not leave her, but just now?",
  "33720": "Then?",
  "33721": "Has anything worried you?",
  "33722": "And who shall then stick closest to ye, and excite others?",
  "33723": "Can I rely upon you?",
  "33724": "Oh, you are the young feller who did that poster?",
  "33725": "Do you know of any houses?",
  "33726": "Do you mean to say that this slip of paper will help us?",
  "33727": "What identity?",
  "33728": "Did you bring the things I mentioned?",
  "33729": "But, my lord, if there be no secret of penitence, will the director consent to my being here?",
  "33730": "Do you have a faith, or a knowledge, you follow, which helps you to live and to do right?",
  "33731": "Is not this what we would have all men do to us?",
  "33732": "You hussy, how dare you talk in that way?",
  "33733": "Now, what shall we do?",
  "33734": "Which should it be?",
  "33735": "Will you follow me?",
  "33736": "What else can I do?",
  "33737": "How would you like to come into a house and find everyone muttering to themselves?",
  "33738": "And can the just by justice make men unjust, or speaking general can the good by virtue make them bad?",
  "33739": "You're sure?",
  "33740": "Are we to see profound wisdom in this?",
  "33741": "Is it not, said she, whispering her husband in his ear, is it not a noble nose?",
  "33742": "Who'll keep THEM quiet?",
  "33743": "Had any difference arisen between him and her papa?",
  "33744": "And what shall I?",
  "33745": "Not so much so?",
  "33746": "You are fond of it?",
  "33747": "May I see it?",
  "33748": "Tell me, do you know what the countess, for whose pardon you are beseeching me, has done?",
  "33749": "Had she not openly avowed her intention of marrying for money if she ever had the chance?",
  "33750": "That the boy may sink and perish?",
  "33751": "Whose there?",
  "33752": "Been there long?",
  "33753": "Which is the way?",
  "33754": "Or his starch'd beard?",
  "33755": "Who knows what may be in store for you yet?",
  "33756": "By this?",
  "33757": "And not long?",
  "33758": "Is that certain?",
  "33759": "Are you asleep?",
  "33760": "Any ideas?",
  "33761": "Have we been deceived by an illusion?",
  "33762": "Was it physical?",
  "33763": "Caution?",
  "33764": "Did not you know that, my dear lord?",
  "33765": "Did not your friend here look like me?",
  "33766": "What are you rattling in there?",
  "33767": "But again, will they tell us that such a nature, placed under favourable circumstances, will not be perfectly good and wise if any ever was?",
  "33768": "Has not one of you a cross?",
  "33769": "And what does the judge affirm to be the life which is next, and the pleasure which is next?",
  "33770": "Was my uncle stark mad?",
  "33771": "Or have we found angels in the forms of kings to govern him?",
  "33772": "More in your brains than in your pocket, eh?",
  "33773": "He has come, then, as they told me?",
  "33774": "The only unofficial detective?",
  "33775": "Have you had lunch yet?",
  "33776": "Far from here?",
  "33777": "Whither is it carrying me?",
  "33778": "And where are they looking for her?",
  "33779": "Who told you this?",
  "33780": "Of what was he thinking?",
  "33781": "Do you think it is too much?",
  "33782": "D'you remember you were rather sniffy about meeting him?",
  "33783": "Is that what you wished to say?",
  "33784": "How much of the ballast of conservatism and of loyalty to tradition is it well to throw overboard in the interest of accelerated motion?",
  "33785": "Shall a similar end be pursued for the ethical purpose of widening the circle of those who shall live and be happy?",
  "33786": "Why have they not seized me?",
  "33787": "When did it happen and what has happened?",
  "33788": "You see?",
  "33789": "How could we like a people who treated us so unjustly?",
  "33790": "When shall the day come when we shall lift our hands?",
  "33791": "Are you then making a thesis?",
  "33792": "Would you like me to bring some rice?",
  "33793": "Who do you want?",
  "33794": "How did he get 'em?",
  "33795": "And is my life to be forfeit, is some terrible punishment to come on my poor old head for that which I cannot help?",
  "33796": "You will be frank with me?",
  "33797": "And was that the head and front of his offending?",
  "33798": "And must he not be represented as such?",
  "33799": "But what's he doing here?",
  "33800": "While he indulged himself in this state, amidst a profound silence, the curate, approaching him with great reverence, asked him if he would not be pleased to honour him with his company at dinner?",
  "33801": "He said nothing more?",
  "33802": "And even if he has done wrong, how do I know that he has not condemned himself?",
  "33803": "And do they give you frogs to eat, so's to make you limber?",
  "33804": "A doctor?",
  "33805": "What did you do?",
  "33806": "Would he allow imitation to be the ruling principle of his life, as if he had nothing higher in him?",
  "33807": "That's what you tell this gentleman too, is it?",
  "33808": "He's your husband, eh?",
  "33809": "Can I spare him?",
  "33810": "What now?",
  "33811": "Armed?",
  "33812": "Or may not all three be properly allotted to it?",
  "33813": "Anything up?",
  "33814": "Is that so?",
  "33815": "You do not wish to hear it, perhaps?",
  "33816": "What does it matter to me?",
  "33817": "And will not a true astronomer have the same feeling when he looks at the movements of the stars?",
  "33818": "Why, what else are they?",
  "33819": "And s'pose he steps in here any minute, and sings out my name before I can throw him a wink to keep quiet?",
  "33820": "And the just is the good?",
  "33821": "How have I deviated from those principles, monsieur?",
  "33822": "But why FOUR pounds?",
  "33823": "And what did you find?",
  "33824": "What has he come here for?",
  "33825": "Are you inside?",
  "33826": "Downright?",
  "33827": "Do you think she'll miss you?",
  "33828": "Why was it necessary to weave the queen into this gloomy web of guilt and crime?",
  "33829": "I suppose that is why you live in town?",
  "33830": "What was the result of that memorable expedition?",
  "33831": "What, then, is the defence?",
  "33832": "What do you mean by risk?",
  "33833": "What would be the use?",
  "33834": "How could she make such nails work?",
  "33835": "Am I not the wife of my husband?",
  "33836": "What came after?",
  "33837": "Supposing her to be as good a woman as any you can find, which she certainly is not, why do you wish to connect yourself with anybody at present?",
  "33838": "What is the proposition?",
  "33839": "So?",
  "33840": "How is the snatchblatch?",
  "33841": "Just?",
  "33842": "Did you hear anything of it when you were in those parts?",
  "33843": "What is in this?",
  "33844": "And through what deplorable madness had she thus ruined her life by continual sacrifices?",
  "33845": "Where are the marks of its fangs?",
  "33846": "Who was this novice in war with the effrontery of a luminary?",
  "33847": "In my precinct?",
  "33848": "Is she, my lord?",
  "33849": "May this young lady go with us?",
  "33850": "Has no one come to seek her in this land?",
  "33851": "Then you'll be free?",
  "33852": "Monseigneur?",
  "33853": "Is it not sad?",
  "33854": "Can people enchant each other too much, cajole each other too much, charm each other too much?",
  "33855": "Why do they grease the axles of the wheels?",
  "33856": "If there be doubt as to which of our divisions will get our candidate, is there no doubt as to which of your candidates will get your party?",
  "33857": "What did you take me to your mother for?",
  "33858": "And did they ask you to make a speech?",
  "33859": "Some such object it was, that induced you to call on me?",
  "33860": "But how about money?",
  "33861": "You here at this hour?",
  "33862": "Well, then, was it this eye or that through which you dropped the beetle?",
  "33863": "What did your excellency say?",
  "33864": "Will you then swear to me, that you will never, under any pretext, and from any motive whatsoever, betray to anybody, so much as a single word of what I am now about to tell you?",
  "33865": "Where are you going, you rascal?",
  "33866": "Do you know, my friends, what that plain, seen from the height we are at, resembles?",
  "33867": "What was the good of bringing him?",
  "33868": "Where was it?",
  "33869": "Would she be decent to him, or would she scold him?",
  "33870": "Which is the best wish to wish him?",
  "33871": "How CAN you say 'I am happier,' and nothing changed?",
  "33872": "Why sadden the poor children, and damp their newly cherished hopes?",
  "33873": "And you feel convinced that you must break with him?",
  "33874": "Alone, where?",
  "33875": "And you saw him frequently?",
  "33876": "Why is she so glad?",
  "33877": "But why do you ask?",
  "33878": "What new treasures lay here for science to unfold?",
  "33879": "Rochester?",
  "33880": "What's coming on?",
  "33881": "Are we to wonder, then, if here and there we find in his works an offensive expression?",
  "33882": "Why not cut it?",
  "33883": "What does the letter mean, mother?",
  "33884": "Are we rising into a fiery furnace?",
  "33885": "What substances will you proscribe?",
  "33886": "And what method of surveillance do you employ?",
  "33887": "Oh, well, as it were, what?",
  "33888": "You think so?",
  "33889": "Of how much?",
  "33890": "But we could not prevent it, could we?",
  "33891": "You get your percentage out o' the purchase, I suppose?",
  "33892": "Food enough for all?",
  "33893": "Has she told you she likes me much?",
  "33894": "Why should I envy them?",
  "33895": "What did he say to you?",
  "33896": "But if he were taken back again he would imagine, and truly imagine, that he was descending?",
  "33897": "My friend, my friend, why thus grieve me?",
  "33898": "How does that strike you?",
  "33899": "Forty pounds?",
  "33900": "But I mean another piece?",
  "33901": "Are all voters enlightened?",
  "33902": "And his level, whether higher or lower, could it possibly be the same as hers?",
  "33903": "What makes you so sure?",
  "33904": "What is it in the nature of the oak that causes it to send its root down into the soil and to drink up of its substance?",
  "33905": "What's he going to read?",
  "33906": "Where shall I go?",
  "33907": "Are then at this time the revolutions of the heavens, the constellations of the firmament, and aspects of the planets such, that whosoever shall lose a hatchet shall immediately grow rich?",
  "33908": "What was the primitive tissue?",
  "33909": "How much do you pay a week?",
  "33910": "And he is named?",
  "33911": "How came you by the knowledge?",
  "33912": "Why not win to freedom?",
  "33913": "Does he?",
  "33914": "And if not in the worst, why is it to follow at all?",
  "33915": "What, pray?",
  "33916": "Wherefore?",
  "33917": "Shall I be that?",
  "33918": "And what shall we say of such things as religious duties, of cheerfulness, of good manners, of personal cleanliness?",
  "33919": "Or, have you been a bad steward to yourself, and wasted your property in lawsuits and the like?",
  "33920": "Ah, who put it up?",
  "33921": "But light?",
  "33922": "What has opened her eyes?",
  "33923": "Do you want him?",
  "33924": "And would you indeed damn your precious soul?",
  "33925": "Well, did you see her safely off?",
  "33926": "But is he engaged to her?",
  "33927": "Why, how are all the folks at home?",
  "33928": "Are these persons, then, so rich and powerful?",
  "33929": "Can it give heat to a dead body?",
  "33930": "Where's the use of looking nice, when no one sees me but those cross midgets, and no one cares whether I'm pretty or not?",
  "33931": "And the king has seen the cardinal?",
  "33932": "Detain him?",
  "33933": "And return to life, if there be such a thing, is the birth of the dead into the world of the living?",
  "33934": "Or do you also hate the duke your husband?",
  "33935": "Do you know who it is from?",
  "33936": "Have you been to the opera?",
  "33937": "Not a word to your loving mother, who was growing older too?",
  "33938": "Would you be at ease, and feel that you had played an open part?",
  "33939": "Has your majesty no other orders to give me?",
  "33940": "But what are you going to do with him, now he is alive?",
  "33941": "And what shall I do when papa and you leave me, and I am by myself?",
  "33942": "Why is he sleeping there?",
  "33943": "Had he not told her, yes, told her to make a list, and not to admit anyone who was not on that list?",
  "33944": "Were her fears realized?",
  "33945": "I suppose it bowled the poor blighter over absolutely?",
  "33946": "Who introduced this innovation?",
  "33947": "You are perhaps a tulip fancier?",
  "33948": "May I go in and look?",
  "33949": "When will we be married?",
  "33950": "You're in the habit of shaking hands?",
  "33951": "And which is wise and which is foolish?",
  "33952": "But then he had the woman he loved still remaining?",
  "33953": "Shall I then?",
  "33954": "All ready forward?",
  "33955": "Is there any one here?",
  "33956": "But can such a head be found?",
  "33957": "And ten?",
  "33958": "Do you think if I drink water it would take off this hiccup?",
  "33959": "And this one opposite, who is this?",
  "33960": "Neither may they imitate smiths or other artificers, or oarsmen, or boatswains, or the like?",
  "33961": "You'll be ready this day week, will you?",
  "33962": "How was it possible for one poor tongue, so reviled and persecuted, so humbled, insulted, and triumphed over, to resist three tongues in league against it?",
  "33963": "What was become of them?",
  "33964": "Shall we gather strength but irresolution and inaction?",
  "33965": "And what was in the sealed iron chest?",
  "33966": "Shall I put a little more tea in the pot afore I go, ma'am?",
  "33967": "And what can you conceive more deadly?",
  "33968": "Why did you do it?",
  "33969": "What does she want?",
  "33970": "How do you know about it, and who are you, anyhow?",
  "33971": "What next?",
  "33972": "Deserted?",
  "33973": "When did you get in?",
  "33974": "Will it hit us?",
  "33975": "Do you want to be doing the same?",
  "33976": "Who will bring us bread?",
  "33977": "My friend, what do you tell me?",
  "33978": "Their whistle?",
  "33979": "Where in the world did you get that song?",
  "33980": "Is he very clever?",
  "33981": "Who did I get the statues from?",
  "33982": "Will you have some whiskey and water?",
  "33983": "What news?",
  "33984": "Struck me?",
  "33985": "And you are up?",
  "33986": "What point?",
  "33987": "What is the use of one horse for us two?",
  "33988": "The cardinal was your protector?",
  "33989": "Are the other camels better or worse than that?",
  "33990": "What two lines?",
  "33991": "At twenty minutes to nine?",
  "33992": "Whom have I to love?",
  "33993": "And the rocks with their various strata?",
  "33994": "Did I not say right?",
  "33995": "What could he, an old man, do?",
  "33996": "And now what does he do?",
  "33997": "Is he so?",
  "33998": "Then, at all events, he DID sleep here, did he?",
  "33999": "But do they really believe that at innumerable periods in the earth's history certain elemental atoms have been commanded suddenly to flash into living tissues?",
  "34000": "My name?",
  "34001": "And why should I not?",
  "34002": "How could I escape from this situation?",
  "34003": "Which was the more important, which the less important part?",
  "34004": "You call them that, too?",
  "34005": "But by what means?",
  "34006": "Not come yet?",
  "34007": "Ever hear of lones the packer, hey, ole chappie?",
  "34008": "Is it quite original?",
  "34009": "Did he do that?",
  "34010": "Why should he trust himself to a balloon, that would blaze up like a piece of paper?",
  "34011": "You saw it?",
  "34012": "Like him?",
  "34013": "Would you take a seat, sir?",
  "34014": "And yet what else am I to do?",
  "34015": "Well, have you heard from your husband lately, my dear?",
  "34016": "You refused him?",
  "34017": "How did you know that?",
  "34018": "Can she make your real flecky paste, as melts in your mouth, and lies all up like a puff?",
  "34019": "Yes, what is it?",
  "34020": "Should he stay at home with her, her mother and her sisters?",
  "34021": "What can I do to prevent it?",
  "34022": "Have been brought together, eh?",
  "34023": "Would you like to come up and see her?",
  "34024": "What would you like to do tomorrow?",
  "34025": "Will that arrangement suit you?",
  "34026": "And you shall be included in it, in our happiness, do you hear, father?",
  "34027": "FLOATED?",
  "34028": "Have you eaten anything?",
  "34029": "Did she feel as he did?",
  "34030": "Water to drink?",
  "34031": "You will not serve me, sir, will you?",
  "34032": "How should he be?",
  "34033": "Again, has he greater experience of the pleasures of honour, or the lover of honour of the pleasures of wisdom?",
  "34034": "Is it nothing to hold one's peace?",
  "34035": "And you can do nothing until then?",
  "34036": "When, where?",
  "34037": "Is there generally?",
  "34038": "Yes, but still all this has to be looked after, and who is there to look after it?",
  "34039": "How much will you give me for it?",
  "34040": "What have I to say to them?",
  "34041": "When are you coming back?",
  "34042": "Can anyone be surprised if one gets fond of such a ship?",
  "34043": "Oh, not her?",
  "34044": "If the loyal people united were put to the utmost of their strength by the rebellion, must they not fail when divided and partially paralyzed by a political war among themselves?",
  "34045": "But what is worship?",
  "34046": "Why do you not speak to me?",
  "34047": "In arms against me?",
  "34048": "Do you wish for a proof?",
  "34049": "Where, then?",
  "34050": "Prove?",
  "34051": "Little woman?",
  "34052": "Shall it be said, good reader?",
  "34053": "Are you glad to leave us, dear?",
  "34054": "What had that harsh tyrant of hers done that was good or serviceable for her?",
  "34055": "And the mistress?",
  "34056": "Can one be well while suffering morally?",
  "34057": "Where would be that thrill if I had been as definite as a timetable?",
  "34058": "How long otherwise?",
  "34059": "Tony, where are you going, my charmer?",
  "34060": "What does this tell us?",
  "34061": "How does she use you?",
  "34062": "Have you nothing else to ask him, sir?",
  "34063": "In the nick of time?",
  "34064": "How?",
  "34065": "Mind it?",
  "34066": "How can I help myself?",
  "34067": "Where has he gone?",
  "34068": "That visit not succeeding either, you will go again perhaps?",
  "34069": "Husband, are you as kind and gentle toward your wife as you should be?",
  "34070": "For what is death?",
  "34071": "If I see, clearly see, that ladder leading from plant to man, why should I suppose it breaks off at me and does not go farther and farther?",
  "34072": "Lively?",
  "34073": "Another glass?",
  "34074": "But the great point is, is there a 'Rita' on the list?",
  "34075": "Why should he not try rather to fortify himself, to add to his courtiers, to continually obtain new subsidies, and finally to free himself from dependence on the people, the inevitable goal of all power originating in the people?",
  "34076": "What was the difference whether the alms were given into my hands or into my wife's?",
  "34077": "Do you tell me that the woman is dead?",
  "34078": "Did he take that medicine, men?",
  "34079": "Who would suppose it?",
  "34080": "When was that done which settled the matter?",
  "34081": "What did you say, sir?",
  "34082": "Well and what am I to do now?",
  "34083": "What would be the result of a total extraction of the nitrogen?",
  "34084": "Do you not suspect?",
  "34085": "Did it keep you awake?",
  "34086": "Need any help, officer?",
  "34087": "What's the row now?",
  "34088": "Why are you so bad?",
  "34089": "She never spoke to a soul?",
  "34090": "DO you think race corresponds with nationality?",
  "34091": "Could I ever have believed then that I could come to such humiliation?",
  "34092": "Do you belong to the nobility?",
  "34093": "D'you think they care for us?",
  "34094": "You bring me great news, then, monsieur?",
  "34095": "Did I say above, or seem to imply, that the judge sometimes spoke harshly to his wife?",
  "34096": "Not in health?",
  "34097": "And we have admitted that justice is the excellence of the soul, and injustice the defect of the soul?",
  "34098": "Did you really?",
  "34099": "What was he doing?",
  "34100": "Is he out of his senses?",
  "34101": "Who then?",
  "34102": "Why do I feel so inclined to tease him?",
  "34103": "What monstrous place is this?",
  "34104": "Where is the use of our reckoning?",
  "34105": "You are AFRAID of it?",
  "34106": "Where is the prisoner?",
  "34107": "Is he generally liked?",
  "34108": "Do you mean write to her myself?",
  "34109": "So soon?",
  "34110": "Genius, or insanity, who can say?",
  "34111": "Will not the guardians be the smallest of all the classes who receive a name from the profession of some kind of knowledge?",
  "34112": "A telegram?",
  "34113": "That's the boy, is it?",
  "34114": "At whose house?",
  "34115": "Is this possible, count?",
  "34116": "Which of them do you call her best friend?",
  "34117": "Is sugar always to be produced by vital blood?",
  "34118": "Was it a fear that he should deliver this name to the hazards of another memory than his own?",
  "34119": "You think it's certain he's there?",
  "34120": "Would they not have been as unwilling to part with them as with gold, and have compelled them to stay at home with them?",
  "34121": "Who did you pass on the road?",
  "34122": "What could she do but sob?",
  "34123": "What was that you told me before we left the old house?",
  "34124": "Beautiful and lusty?",
  "34125": "And is not the soul almost or altogether indissoluble?",
  "34126": "Buried amongst them, what met my eye?",
  "34127": "What is the matter with him?",
  "34128": "Might he not well inform the doctor that he had something to tell him for his advantage?",
  "34129": "But how can we gain your freedom?",
  "34130": "Or is this a subject in which new discoveries can be made?",
  "34131": "Has he got to be harnessed up and driven through life like a horse?",
  "34132": "What to do with him?",
  "34133": "Assuming also, again I say, that physical obstacles can be overcome, is not the time opportune for making a start?",
  "34134": "Why should it?",
  "34135": "Are you badly hurt?",
  "34136": "Has he many men, then?",
  "34137": "Will there be mercy for me there?",
  "34138": "I hope your father is well?",
  "34139": "Why then am I dissatisfied if I am going to do the things for which I exist and for which I was brought into the world?",
  "34140": "I tell you?",
  "34141": "You are no longer my father?",
  "34142": "And why, my young friend?",
  "34143": "If we were jurymen, what would we do with this parricide?",
  "34144": "What did they do it for then?",
  "34145": "Can you rely on his word?",
  "34146": "Why the coal country?",
  "34147": "Is that possible?",
  "34148": "What the prime cause of all my woe doth prove?",
  "34149": "Well, brigadier, what is he charged with?",
  "34150": "Look here, what does this mean?",
  "34151": "Liver?",
  "34152": "Will you not speak to them?",
  "34153": "Why, who are you, bold fellow, to range so boldly here?",
  "34154": "You want to speak to me, do you?",
  "34155": "And where is the wounded officer?",
  "34156": "And afterwards?",
  "34157": "What is your illustration?",
  "34158": "He has still hope, but what is it he hopes?",
  "34159": "In a tree?",
  "34160": "The question is, whether it procures most pain or pleasure?",
  "34161": "What's the matter with your legs?",
  "34162": "Who says that?",
  "34163": "How can I play a trick on a monkey?",
  "34164": "What kind of a bird is he?",
  "34165": "But how did you come here?",
  "34166": "Then it is settled?",
  "34167": "Where am I to die?",
  "34168": "What ought to be done?",
  "34169": "How now?",
  "34170": "But will you tell me?",
  "34171": "And do the enchanted sleep, now, senor?",
  "34172": "Is there anything else you would like?",
  "34173": "And you DO think something better of me than you did?",
  "34174": "Shall I not visit for these things?",
  "34175": "And how did it go so fast, so straight ahead, with such staring, staring eyes?",
  "34176": "Should I have to hand over?",
  "34177": "Do they love?",
  "34178": "What should be done with the elephant, which had been so dearly purchased?",
  "34179": "Was he not handsome?",
  "34180": "In making him a duke?",
  "34181": "How can you dare to speak to me like that?",
  "34182": "Whose was it?",
  "34183": "How did I lose her?",
  "34184": "Well, and what did the lady do?",
  "34185": "This has been done so often, and what good has ever come from it?",
  "34186": "Where do the lord and lady sleep?",
  "34187": "But whither am I wandering?",
  "34188": "With what kind of order?",
  "34189": "Why, then, refuse to follow to the end the road opened by science, and to admit an hypothesis which is the inevitable result of experience itself?",
  "34190": "But do you think we shall find the count at home?",
  "34191": "And what I am, to you my friends, now am I not?",
  "34192": "Do you conceive any thing but merely that perception?",
  "34193": "Who are these men you have brought before us?",
  "34194": "Some one holds you in restraint?",
  "34195": "Did you think he came directly from town?",
  "34196": "Will you breakfast with me tomorrow morning?",
  "34197": "Dearest, what?",
  "34198": "What's the news?",
  "34199": "And had you made up your mind what to say to him?",
  "34200": "Is not the president's shoulder still bleeding from the blow it has received?",
  "34201": "Wiggins?",
  "34202": "Oh, when are you going?",
  "34203": "Why should I care?",
  "34204": "What could you do for a boy like that?",
  "34205": "Does it think?",
  "34206": "Why should we ask what comes after the experience, when the experience is still unknown to us?",
  "34207": "Was he not the prince of men?",
  "34208": "Are not these dread words for a nation bearing in her bosom so mighty an injustice?",
  "34209": "What has happened?",
  "34210": "On what days?",
  "34211": "Or what hopes have we of deliverance by thus continuing faithful to such wicked wretches?",
  "34212": "Who's accused you?",
  "34213": "What's one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one?",
  "34214": "But the question again recurs, upon what pretense could he be put in possession of a force of that magnitude in time of peace?",
  "34215": "What can I do for the son?",
  "34216": "What, after the last?",
  "34217": "That I might lose them?",
  "34218": "Who is my mother?",

  "34224": "Had she no tears for the rough friend who laughed at the silk shoes, and taught her how to hold the reins and never fear that the old pony would run away with her?",
  "34225": "Where could my uncle be at that moment?",
  "34226": "Does he not want anything else?",
  "34227": "Why should I guard me?",
  "34228": "What am I to say or to do to make you understand that my only idea of happiness is the idea that sooner or later I may get you to be my wife?",

  "34230": "What was the reply?",
  "34231": "Did business men commonly go into an expenditure of money which could be of no account to them?",
  "34232": "And then, in the next place, was it probable that the dean would act upon such a letter by filling up the vacancy, even if he did get it?",
  "34233": "And if not, WHO IS IN THE ROOM besides you and me?",
  "34234": "Must it of necessity be admitted that this power is infringed, so long as a part of the old articles remain?",
  "34235": "Had any papers been handed about among them, similar to these lists?",
  "34236": "Shall I go?",
  "34237": "On what charge do you expect to be arrested?",
  "34238": "But what can we expect from a turnip?",
  "34239": "And what am I now?",
  "34240": "A widow, ma'am?",
  "34241": "Well, what happened when you did get there?",
  "34242": "You say two faces were familiar to you?",
  "34243": "You opened the letter?",
  "34244": "But what are all these birds doing in heaven?",
  "34245": "Is this, also, some enchanted person?",
  "34246": "But what was it?",
  "34247": "I mean to say, what?",
  "34248": "Ha, friend?",
  "34249": "And what about his wife and family?",
  "34250": "Is it necessary that a bourgeoisie which stands in such need of you should disown you?",

  "34252": "Now, my good fellow, how are you?",
  "34253": "She was about to say?",
  "34254": "Do you have a teaching?",
  "34255": "Has labor, once so fecund, likewise become sterile?",
  "34256": "Then what do you talk of?",
  "34257": "A signal for others?",
  "34258": "Who, and what are you?",

  "34270": "Then I am not to be allowed to have anything to do with it officially?",
  "34271": "Can I go, can I go?",
  "34272": "Is she a friend of yours?",
  "34273": "Or will you be my friend, as you have been hitherto, and do what I request?",
  "34274": "Do you mean it?",
  "34275": "What is that queer concern going down the river?",
  "34276": "Was that all she said I said?",
  "34277": "But how cast off all the superfluous, devilish burden of my outer man?",
  "34278": "Why then is that rather a misfortune than this a good fortune?",
  "34279": "There now, what is it?",
  "34280": "Anything in the gruff and grumble way?",
  "34281": "Oh, my father, must your past career always interfere with my successes?",
  "34282": "Have I furnished it nicely?",
  "34283": "What am I doing here, anyway?",
  "34284": "From what causes do I derive my existence, and to what condition shall I return?",
  "34285": "Who put that paper there?",
  "34286": "Will you tell me what you're going to do with the skin?",
  "34287": "Do you suppose I am going to bring my ropes, my windlass, and set it up, and go down there with my boy and let myself be bitten, perhaps, by your cursed dog for the pleasure of giving it back to you?",
  "34288": "What will you do, then?",
  "34289": "What sort of a life could we build on such foundations?",
  "34290": "Ay, said I, but who can help constitution?",
  "34291": "Not chilled, pet, are you?",
  "34292": "Gone?",
  "34293": "Where had you seen me before?",
  "34294": "And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a fait accompli?",
  "34295": "And to sign the contract in three days?",
  "34296": "And that is your opinion?",
  "34297": "Can one?",
  "34298": "Was it wonderful that I was misanthropic and sullen?",
  "34299": "Who compels me to this?",
  "34300": "What had she done?",
  "34301": "Do you love him?",
  "34302": "Not even by lightening it, as they lighten an overloaded vessel?",
  "34303": "Is there any other witness?",
  "34304": "Do you think I am so poor and short of clothes, or that I have so few cloaks and as to be unable to find comfortable beds both for myself and for my guests?",
  "34305": "Meg, shall we ever learn to talk less?",
  "34306": "What then, when that's once done?",
  "34307": "Then why did you come here, my dear?",
  "34308": "Why should my courtesie to these knights go all for naught?",
  "34309": "Was I, then, a monster, a blot upon the earth, from which all men fled and whom all men disowned?",
  "34310": "Could the latter for a moment suppose that the son would not offer the best part to the father?",
  "34311": "Why should she be sorry?",
  "34312": "Who, then, has counselled you to take this step, one for which the court is deeply indebted to you, and which is perfectly natural, considering your birth and your misfortunes?",
  "34313": "And so?",
  "34314": "Seek introductions, draw petitions up?",
  "34315": "How do we know what is at the bottom of his sudden interest in you?",
  "34316": "Wherefore?",
  "34317": "How do you account for this?",
  "34318": "And on what occasions have such favors been bestowed upon you?",
  "34319": "Do you think that will be really necessary?",
  "34320": "Any other letters?",
  "34321": "And where the prudence now that awed mankind?",
  "34322": "What will the ladies take for breakfast?",
  "34323": "Where did you learn how I speak of others?",
  "34324": "Does it hurt you so much?",
  "34325": "You are not angry with me?",
  "34326": "What if her interest in him were not so entirely that of a relative as it had formerly been?",
  "34327": "Did you see them off, before you came away?",
  "34328": "What on earth are we to do with him?",
  "34329": "Does it consist in the greater security afforded by a greater variety of parties, against the event of any one party being able to outnumber and oppress the rest?",
  "34330": "Should you like to sleep?",
  "34331": "Why, it may be asked, has the supposed creative force produced bats and no other mammals on remote islands?",
  "34332": "Should he not have a regard for his health and efficiency?",
  "34333": "Shall I tell you each ornament of your toilet?",
  "34334": "How does he get it, then?",
  "34335": "Can it be believed that they would thus act to no purpose during their courtship?",
  "34336": "How know you this man has?",
  "34337": "Was there ever such a sober, sentimental interview?",
  "34338": "And as it is to so go at all events, may we not agree that the sooner the better?",
  "34339": "Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?",
  "34340": "And why were you not willing?",
  "34341": "Are you so and so?",
  "34342": "May I suppose that you have this distinction of the visible and intelligible fixed in your mind?",
  "34343": "What's the good of getting away?",
  "34344": "Is it not adherence to the old and tried, against the new and untried?",
  "34345": "What can I do?",
  "34346": "Are or are not our interests conflicting?",
  "34347": "And by whom were they recommended to you?",
  "34348": "Paid according to the labor that they had performed, of what could they complain?",
  "34349": "And if it is proper to demand proof that justice should be done and the truth spoken, why may one not demand proof that men should be prudent and benevolent?",
  "34350": "What would his guards think if they heard him shout like a madman?",
  "34351": "How about the lion and the lioness?",
  "34352": "Does the reader wish to know where the majority of the songs of the galleys, those refrains called in the special vocabulary lirlonfa, have had their birth?",
  "34353": "Had they been heard?",
  "34354": "You are pleased it is a girl?",
  "34355": "Why should not schools be established, a comfortable hotel be erected, a church be built?",
  "34356": "What the devil is the meaning of all this?",
  "34357": "I suppose your people will be here to meet you?",
  "34358": "What could hinder the poor canoe, followed by sea and watched from the shore, from succumbing before the end of the day?",

  "34360": "When will he be able to be moved?",
  "34361": "What is the matter, then?",
  "34362": "Then this child is not yours?",
  "34363": "What is to be done, then?",

  "34370": "Was there an accident?",
  "34371": "May it be?",
  "34372": "Did I not see you trying to tear off another piece?",
  "34373": "Is it common sense, I ask you, to leave up windows which shut out all the daylight, and even confuse the eyes by throwing patches of colour, to which I should be hard put to it to give a name, on a floor in which there are not two slabs on the same level?",
  "34374": "Have you a name, then?",
  "34375": "You're not getting into a state, are you?",
  "34376": "That's the boy, is it?",
  "34377": "But did you ever like knocking about in such discomfort?",

  "34381": "What can we do for you?",
  "34382": "What commission is this you give me, and what do you charge me to tell his majesty, monsieur?",
  "34383": "It's capital for us here, but what of him?",
  "34384": "Where, where?",
  "34385": "Why are you not so now?",
  "34386": "I should?",
  "34387": "What does it matter where my body happens to be?",

  "34436": "Where would he make himself a prisoner and how?",
  "34437": "Did ever anybody hear the like ?",
  "34438": "How did it come about?",

  "34441": "Have you recognised him, monsieur?",
  "34442": "Must one then curse immediately, when one doth not love?",
  "34443": "And why is that?",
  "34444": "What of the hunting, hunter bold?",
  "34445": "Shall I do wrong because I am unhappy?",
  "34446": "Who's equal to the place?",
  "34447": "What is this, my dear?",
  "34448": "Was it not foolish?",
  "34449": "What would my good father say, who so strongly pointed out to me the respect due to the cardinal, if he knew I was in the society of such pagans?",

  "34452": "Do you know what your wife wants?",
  "34453": "If she be not fair to me, what care I how fair she be?",

  "34474": "Or in what language shall we speak of that house, once celebrated for its rare attractions to the furthest ends of the civilised world, and now silent and desolate as the grave?",
  "34475": "Are we disposed to be of the number of those who, having eyes, see not, and, having ears, hear not, the things which so nearly concern their temporal salvation?",
  "34476": "For what have we to do on earth but faithfully to exercise charity towards each other?",
  "34477": "Are my books, then, heretics or phlegmaties that you want to burn them?",
  "34478": "Is there no mistake on your part?",
  "34479": "What name did they give the child?",

  "34486": "And what did you see?",
  "34487": "What is your real name?",
  "34488": "Is that tender sensibility of spiritual things filling your heart?",
  "34489": "And you would not say that the percentage of sodium bicarbonate was too great for the ordinary taste?",
  "34490": "Ah, yes, but could so fantastic a pauper get admission to the august presence of a monarch?",
  "34491": "Might it not prove a little worse than she expected?",
  "34492": "And then it will all come out?",
  "34493": "Am I not as good a lady as she?",

  "34593": "You advertised a runaway servant, the other day?",
  "34594": "What is our crime?",
  "34595": "Is that long enough?",
  "34596": "Where could he go, then?",
  "34597": "Why should she have done such a thing?",
  "34598": "Up the chimney?",
  "34599": "You are the day porter, are you not?",
  "34600": "Is it not, indeed, the height of imprudence to grant equality of political rights to men of unequal conditions?",
  "34601": "Whom did it prosper?",
  "34602": "Has not art found that she is beautiful?",
  "34603": "The hopes and dreams so lately come, were they only hopes and dreams?",
  "34604": "But if you feel no indignation or compassion arise in you from this complication of circumstances, you would in vain ask him, in what consists the crime or villainy, which he so vehemently exclaims against?",
  "34605": "Who knows if she is right?",
  "34606": "An allusion to what?",
  "34607": "Do you think, my dear father and mother, there ever was so happy a creature as I?",
  "34608": "From what head could the lock be cut but mine?",
  "34609": "Will you never let us go?",
  "34610": "But what had happened to you?",
  "34611": "Are we quite alone, my friend?",
  "34612": "What is his name, and where do I find him?",
  "34613": "How are things going on at home?",
  "34614": "How are you, old neighbour?",
  "34615": "Do you mind if I come over to this table?",
  "34616": "What would you have done?",
  "34617": "Or must the discoverer of a continent prove a real occupancy, by performing the ridiculous task of the abnormal center of the mythical mathematical infinite circle, by being everywhere at the same time?",
  "34618": "Was it fear of not obtaining that succor I stood in need of, which agitated me to this degree?",
  "34619": "Are you then so little acquainted with your father as not to know that he would destroy us both if we should dare to set at naught his paternal and his royal authority?",
  "34620": "Is this going to suit every one?",
  "34621": "May I go and tell him you are here?",
  "34622": "When shall you be in?",
  "34623": "Your women, I believe, were something awful, were they not?",
  "34624": "No use at all?",
  "34625": "For whom?",
  "34626": "Who do you suppose is with me?",
  "34627": "Where did you get the mouth and chin from?",

  "34633": "Should I now?",
  "34634": "Do you not approve of my plan, my friend?",
  "34635": "Die?",
  "34636": "Is this all the distinction of the rich in the grave?",
  "34637": "Some have been served so?",
  "34638": "Shall I see you?",
  "34639": "But what is this, count, only one glass?",
  "34640": "Why should I not give him my heart, since, thanks to your intercession, I am no longer bound to choose a husband of equal birth?",
  "34641": "And for pirates?",
  "34642": "O, THAT'S your errand, is it?",
  "34643": "You weep for my danger?",
  "34644": "And what is easier than for an intelligent government to so manage all industrial transitions?",
  "34645": "Why is it, then, that this interest on capital is not regarded as a sufficient supplement of net product?",
  "34646": "She's not seriously hurt?",
  "34647": "Well, and for whom are you going to look for her?",
  "34648": "No smell?",
  "34649": "Of what tendency is that change?",
  "34650": "The effect of habits left?",
  "34651": "Is it you?",
  "34652": "Are we cannibals, let me ask?",

  "34654": "Not to give me a kiss?",
  "34655": "Than any one at all?",
  "34656": "What pillar of security does the landed interest require more than any other interest in the state, or what right has it to a distinct and separate representation from the general interest of a nation?",
  "34657": "Something to my advantage?",
  "34658": "What did she really want?",
  "34659": "Have I done anything to you?",
  "34660": "Sermons?",
  "34661": "This man?",
  "34662": "Forgot?",
  "34663": "How can the way of a superior man be such as to make fools of any of them?",
  "34664": "And did your superior order you to treat me in this way?",
  "34665": "Give me leave to crave your name, sir?",
  "34666": "And what lies beyond?",
  "34667": "Or the knowledge of all other things if we have no knowledge of beauty and goodness?",
  "34668": "How comes it, then, that he is prince of devils?",
  "34669": "Does the injustice or other evil which exists in the soul waste and consume her?",
  "34670": "Have you no sense to devise a system which will make you independent of all efforts, and all wills, but your own?",
  "34671": "Did I intend to insult him?",
  "34672": "And how do you do, sir?",
  "34673": "Have you been here ever since?",
  "34674": "What did I come here to seek?",
  "34675": "What is this business about?",
  "34676": "Where did you start up from?",
  "34677": "You repeated to yourself this morning the brief scene of last night?",
  "34678": "You let the cage alone, and let me wring its neck will you?",
  "34679": "For if he who resolveth bravely oftentimes falleth short, how shall it be with him who resolveth rarely or feebly?",
  "34680": "Which wings must I flop first?",
  "34681": "Will you talk sensibly?",
  "34682": "What time was that?",
  "34683": "Are they not grotesquely trying?",
  "34684": "Then he has not returned?",
  "34685": "A worm of the earth in a carriage?",
  "34686": "And if not now, when?",
  "34687": "Is it in your dwelling?",
  "34688": "Would you not choose me rather than the other?",
  "34689": "What shall I say?",
  "34690": "And that running footman who waited at the door, and that carriage with a coachman in grand livery who sat waiting on his seat?",
  "34691": "I have told you, have I not, that you are too late?",
  "34692": "But do you not see that this is what you imply when you say that the soul existed before she took the form and body of man, and was made up of elements which as yet had no existence?",
  "34693": "And how was he to answer this?",
  "34694": "D'you WANT to come away with me?",
  "34695": "Do you think it a good one?",
  "34696": "Would he remember what took place in the relapse?",
  "34697": "And what do you call these?",
  "34698": "Who shall rebuild that building?",
  "34699": "SHALL I wish you good day for the present on the part of myself and the gentleman of the house?",
  "34700": "What kind of insect?",
  "34701": "It rings true, eh?",
  "34702": "Not good enough to stand it?",
  "34703": "How many times are you supposing that she has tried?",
  "34704": "And what similar use or power of acquisition has justice in time of peace?",
  "34705": "Will my bane perhaps come out of it?",
  "34706": "What can you give us for supper?",
  "34707": "Who shall go, then?",
  "34708": "Who was ever more ardently and deeply regretted?",
  "34709": "Who has not had their letters, with the wafers wet, and the announcement that a person is waiting in the hall?",
  "34710": "Expenses of journeys?",
  "34711": "Who said?",
  "34712": "My income?",
  "34713": "What am I to do at all?",
  "34714": "Or, do you mean that I am an atheist simply, and a teacher of atheism?",
  "34715": "Which means that you now hesitate?",
  "34716": "Well, are you going?",
  "34717": "No, but why do you think so?",
  "34718": "Do you wish to know the regulator of a society?",

  "34728": "Is the doctor here?",
  "34729": "Do you think that you wish to see him again?",
  "34730": "Is that a woman in breeches?",
  "34731": "And anybody could call you up at any time and talk?",
  "34732": "Was it not necessary in the end for men to sacrifice everything comforting, holy, healing, all hope, all faith in hidden harmonies, in future blessedness and justice?",
  "34733": "Well, you find it exciting too?",
  "34734": "Then this house does not belong to that tall lady who wears a watch, and who said we were to have some bread and cheese?",
  "34735": "For me?",
  "34736": "Do you think you will ever get to college?",
  "34737": "Where does that light come from?",
  "34738": "Or whether we received a fair compensation for the extent of country ceded by these four individuals?",
  "34739": "And he is good in as far as he is wise, and bad in as far as he is foolish?",
  "34740": "Oh, that's what you're after, is it?",
  "34741": "And with her lover?",
  "34742": "Did it bite?",
  "34743": "What would become of her?",
  "34744": "Why do you make a scene about it?",
  "34745": "Then you remember everything that went on about you from the time when you were three years old?",
  "34746": "Do you think it was all an illusion?",
  "34747": "But why so many precautions?",
  "34748": "Was ever the like heard, my dear father and mother?",
  "34749": "Why not he?",
  "34750": "What is freedom for?",
  "34751": "Do they pretend that he named the man who lent me the money?",
  "34752": "Is that quite a little wish?",
  "34753": "So you'll give her the packet?",
  "34754": "Why are they running?",
  "34755": "What do you think of my situation?",
  "34756": "But where are we all going?",
  "34757": "Am I a sight, that you stand gazing there?",
  "34758": "Why, what is one to think?",
  "34759": "What did they expect of her?",
  "34760": "What would the result be, after marching blindly for so long and over such impossible ground, as we had been doing?",
  "34761": "Shall I then ever see this?",
  "34762": "To walk across the moor?",
  "34763": "Come now, what was this duel about?",
  "34764": "From whom comes this letter?",
  "34765": "What makes you behave so?",
  "34766": "These gentlemen are with you?",
  "34767": "And what did you do?",
  "34768": "Hurt I modesty?",
  "34769": "Is there anyone I can write to for a reference?",
  "34770": "How much do you mean to say it wants then?",
  "34771": "In practice here?",
  "34772": "But would the subterranean fires provoke any violent eruption?",
  "34773": "Could it lie?",
  "34774": "Then you pity him?",

  "34785": "What for use?",
  "34786": "Or was it possible that his guardian was anxious to prevent him from marrying from some view of the reversion of the large fortune?",
  "34787": "What is slang?",
  "34788": "There he is, do you see him?",
  "34789": "Just oblige me with that torch again, will you?",
  "34790": "And what classes of chance people come to practise at your gallery?",
  "34791": "Why was the expression of the whole face so cold and severe?",
  "34792": "Well, and was she standing with him, my good girl?",

  "34801": "Or was it through your hard endurances of cold and hunger?",
  "34802": "And what is your name?",
  "34803": "Suppose it should be a serpent?",
  "34804": "Will you give it up?",
  "34805": "Is it not because there would be something egregiously unfashionable in it?",

  "34807": "How mend matters?",
  "34808": "Ho, ho, ho, ho, my good people, my friends and my faithful servants, must I hinder you from helping me?",
  "34809": "And should you like to fall into that pit, and to be burning there for ever?",
  "34810": "What is the day?",

  "34828": "And how am I to get back?",
  "34829": "Do you consider him in present danger, sir?",
  "34830": "And what did you do?",
  "34831": "When do they get up?",
  "34832": "How comes it, father, that you treat me thus?",
  "34833": "But when?",
  "34834": "On the other and more friendly side, was it true that the vexatious passport system had been abrogated?",
  "34835": "What do you wish me to explain?",
  "34836": "What can you see?",
  "34837": "Have you really committed the crimes of which you are accused?",
  "34838": "Was it not honestly a trial to listen to an argument such as that?",

  "34854": "Esperance?",
  "34855": "Can it be, then, that by that act of physical isolation, he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward worldly ties and connexions?",
  "34856": "Is it likely, if I have any project in hand that I ought to keep secret from you, I should tell you about it?",
  "34857": "And your name?",
  "34858": "What would he do, then?",
  "34859": "But do they know, at least, how to act circumspectly?",
  "34860": "Shall I live to get into it?",
  "34861": "Did you ever give him your promise, eh?",
  "34862": "Any affinity to wantonness and intemperance?",
  "34863": "What was to be done with the rebel armies when defeated?",

  "34876": "What can this be?",
  "34877": "Could I ever have loved you, had I not known you better than you know yourself?",
  "34878": "Was a mere drudge to be employed?",
  "34879": "You have never gloated over me as the bird of prey gloats over the poor beast that is soon to become carrion beneath its claws?",
  "34880": "Do you suppose,' asked the second one, that you are the only living thing that craves with a hungry longing to hear the cuckoo's note again?",
  "34881": "But can you think of something else at this moment?",
  "34882": "A humourist too?",
  "34883": "What will she do?",
  "34884": "What degree of recognition should be given to the will of each individual, or to the separate volitions and desires in the life of the individual?",
  "34885": "But your family have been with us for several generations, have they not?",
  "34886": "And you too?",
  "34887": "And from being a keeper of the law he is converted into a breaker of it?",
  "34888": "Or why not grow a few extra fancy strawberries in the well cultivated spots about these trees?",
  "34889": "Courage?",
  "34890": "For in what does your strength consist?",

  "34895": "At which hotel?",
  "34896": "And who is with madame?",
  "34897": "Thinks I you are a pretty blade, aint you?",
  "34898": "You're there, are you?",
  "34899": "Would she not have proved her devotion better by bringing the mutual pail safely to the bottom of the hill, and there attending to the wounds of her fallen hero?",
  "34900": "Have you ever heard of any tutor whom you would prefer to another?",
  "34901": "Are you awake?",
  "34902": "But what do you allow that we should do about it?",
  "34903": "But where in the world is she?",

  "36935": "Your four pair of stockings, one silk, three worsted?",
  "36936": "Who could have foreseen such a terrible catastrophe?",
  "36937": "Where in your world have you seen papers like this?",
  "36938": "Will the queen deign to follow my advice?",
  "36939": "Need we any other proof of their wretched management, than the excess of debts and taxes with which every nation groans, and the quarrels into which they have precipitated the world?",
  "36940": "What did you please to say, sir?",
  "36941": "Which is the child?",
  "36942": "And are we two the only folk here?",
  "36943": "Dear guardian, how could I object to your writing anything for ME to read?",
  "36944": "How's this passage of yours going to help us?",
  "36945": "You have no occasion to come here to learn that, I suppose?",
  "36946": "Brabazon?",
  "36947": "And do you like it here?",
  "36948": "Shall we settle ourselves here?",
  "36949": "But of what consequence is the subject?",
  "36950": "Yes, dear?",
  "36951": "Do you mean to say that she does not love me?",
  "36952": "What do you say of this, for example?",
  "36953": "Was she full of them when you saw her?",
  "36954": "And for the whole day?",
  "36955": "Not go as I have said?",
  "36956": "Will that suffice?",
  "36957": "How could you know anything of the matter?",
  "36958": "What body?",
  "36959": "What do you know against him?",
  "36960": "Who could help laughing at a king hunkering on a branch and his army roosting around him like hens?",
  "36961": "Have you seen a pimp outface his own wants better?",
  "36962": "Where is she?",
  "36963": "How can one expect it?",
  "36964": "For what else are all these things, except exercises for the reason, when it has viewed carefully and by examination into their nature the things which happen in life?",
  "36965": "Where's the kid?",
  "36966": "My father?",
  "36967": "Is there an answer?",
  "36968": "I only wish to know whether you will employ this courage for your queen?",
  "36969": "What are hysterics?",
  "36970": "Were you ever there, my lord?",
  "36971": "But what are the relations, I ask, of which you here talk?",
  "36972": "But could you not compromise matters, and give up a portion of your fortune to her son?",
  "36973": "Well, what conclusion have you reached?",
  "36974": "My father, what is this you crave?",
  "36975": "How do you feel, my dear?",
  "36976": "Your daughter?",
  "36977": "What in the world has happened?",
  "36978": "Can you give me any circumstances or particulars?",
  "36979": "What was he waiting for?",
  "36980": "Is it good news?",
  "36981": "Besides, what object could the creature have for this extraordinary deception?",
  "36982": "Cut?",
  "36983": "But are you SURE?",
  "36984": "Shall we see you tomorrow to dinner?",
  "36985": "You live in their milieu?",
  "36986": "What have I to strive and toil for?",
  "36987": "And will you call it being against you, if the queen does not choose you for her confessor?",
  "36988": "Oh, that's this missionary?",
  "36989": "Will you disclose the whole?",
  "36990": "What's all this fuss?",
  "36991": "What ails you?",
  "36992": "How shall I moil 'em?",
  "36993": "What could sadden him thus?",
  "36994": "But could he trust himself?",
  "36995": "Is this country good for cattle?",
  "36996": "What say I?",
  "36997": "Why did they lure me there?",
  "36998": "Does he say that, papa?",
  "36999": "Do you not think that, as a daughter, I am right?",
  "37000": "How shall I go about in quest of a wight whom I know not and whom, if I saw him face to face, I should not know?",
  "37001": "Are you trying to, play pranks on an old man?",
  "37002": "Their virtue, their justice, their power?",
  "37003": "What honor has the khansamah?",
  "37004": "What, always the same ditty?",
  "37005": "Will you take advantage of this reconciliation to put down or restrain me?",
  "37006": "Can sowing begin?",
  "37007": "How am I duped?",
  "37008": "Where in this vicinity will you go and not meet some monument to inspire such sentiments?",
  "37009": "Right?",
  "37010": "And how's your friend, sir?",
  "37011": "Who are you angry with?",
  "37012": "Got stung, I daresay?",
  "37013": "And where is he now?",
  "37014": "Yes, what makes you ask?",
  "37015": "Shall we go into dinner?",
  "37016": "How did you hear that?",
  "37017": "Lynde?",
  "37018": "For of what use would this precaution be, if there were nothing to gain by it?",
  "37019": "Was she now to be as light, as foolish, as easy, as in those former days from which she had learned her wisdom?",
  "37020": "Do you think it will do?",
  "37021": "Is he glad of it or not?",
  "37022": "Oh, what can I do for him?",
  "37023": "And how shall I travel, then?",
  "37024": "Oh, you agree, do you?",
  "37025": "Was he by himself?",
  "37026": "And what is it you'll say to me, and I after doing it this time in the face of all?",
  "37027": "And who's he?",
  "37028": "Does it interest you?",
  "37029": "What, my horse?",
  "37030": "Then he was certainly there?",
  "37031": "Surely your wife knew?",
  "37032": "Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?",
  "37033": "What is the reason of this sudden call?",
  "37034": "Do I find a fault, and nobody repairs it?",
  "37035": "Cried I, who carrieth his ashes unto the mountain?",
  "37036": "Is it a simple matter to keep silence?",
  "37037": "You have no faith in me?",
  "37038": "Is it any wonder that it rests with us now, with a bewildering sense of some power outside ourselves or our comprehension?",
  "37039": "How can you single out angels from among devils?",
  "37040": "Is it so very bad?",
  "37041": "Does that hurt you in any way?",
  "37042": "Shall I send the father to you?",
  "37043": "Are you quite alone, this year?",
  "37044": "Have I not given you to understand that, for a while at least, I would prefer to keep the contents of this epistle to myself?",
  "37045": "Can you say so?",
  "37046": "And here he proposed articles to you, I understand?",
  "37047": "The slab which closes the vault?",
  "37048": "How are matches made, except by bringing men and women together?",
  "37049": "Well, anyway, what ARE we going to do?",
  "37050": "But who is to carry you, said she, to your father and mother?",
  "37051": "You have nothing more to say?",
  "37052": "Who counsels best?",
  "37053": "What's the best place to stay at for the night round here?",
  "37054": "But whether made by one side or the other, would each side enjoy equal advantages on the trial?",
  "37055": "Not fear of the thunder, surely?",
  "37056": "Do you know he is a convict, a felon, a common thief?",
  "37057": "For what do they commemorate as concerns you and myself?",
  "37058": "Meaning that you saw none?",
  "37059": "Work?",
  "37060": "Were you much hurt?",
  "37061": "Do you still think you found somebody fairer?",
  "37062": "Did he steal?",
  "37063": "What stage have they reached, sir?",
  "37064": "Will no one come?",
  "37065": "Well, what?",
  "37066": "Had he a whip in his hand?",
  "37067": "When was there ever a time when he had experienced happiness, felt a true bliss?",
  "37068": "But can you not say that, sir?",
  "37069": "Why should I go back?",
  "37070": "Do you know what he did, sir?",
  "37071": "How far now can this negative mode of proceeding be carried?",
  "37072": "Why should you?",
  "37073": "And do you see that other one, who has an eagle and a dragon painted side by side upon his shield?",
  "37074": "Can I speak plainer?",
  "37075": "Who sent it?",
  "37076": "Will not a small body and a large one float the same way under the same influence?",
  "37077": "Can you give us any reason why we should not put you to death?",
  "37078": "Why had no word of any kind come from him?",
  "37079": "Made by whom?",
  "37080": "Have blows passed?",
  "37081": "And why was I so furious about it?",
  "37082": "Now, who was that someone?",
  "37083": "Who told you so?",
  "37084": "How long is this thing going on like this?",
  "37085": "How much did it cost him?",
  "37086": "How are we today?",
  "37087": "Need I recall either the scene or the national circumstances attending the occasion?",
  "37088": "You're ready, are you?",
  "37089": "Of whom speak you?",
  "37090": "Do you know?",
  "37091": "What am I saying?",
  "37092": "Might not that influence be altogether disastrous?",
  "37093": "What shall I say of this man?",
  "37094": "Is it not the impiety of the inhabitants?",
  "37095": "Was he carrying a hat?",
  "37096": "And the lustful and tyrannical desires are, as we saw, at the greatest distance?",
  "37097": "Who's there?",
  "37098": "When do you desire to go?",
  "37099": "The associate?",
  "37100": "But to whom, then?",
  "37101": "You feel strong enough to walk a little way now?",
  "37102": "What odds in that?",
  "37103": "And do you imagine he realizes all the awfulness of my position?",
  "37104": "Is the world, then, so narrow?",
  "37105": "When did music come this way?",
  "37106": "And what means have you to suggest, may I ask?",
  "37107": "What have we here?",
  "37108": "A spy?",
  "37109": "What are you worrying for, so long as he has money?",
  "37110": "Why did you ask me?",
  "37111": "What did these sealed mysterious letters bring him?",
  "37112": "How long will it take you to make up your mind?",
  "37113": "How of the window?",
  "37114": "And what did she for you?",
  "37115": "Well, how is your district council doing?",
  "37116": "Ought we not, then, to put our virtue and fortitude to the severest tests?",
  "37117": "May you come to me?",
  "37118": "What was his affair?",
  "37119": "Are you a magician?",
  "37120": "How long is it?",
  "37121": "Should you think all that pleasant enough if I forgave you?",
  "37122": "Were not these madmen common enough in such a prison?",
  "37123": "Of HIM?",
  "37124": "Is he hurt badly?",
  "37125": "What the devil is it all about?",
  "37126": "Does he now say that he did not make that promise?",
  "37127": "What was his name?",
  "37128": "Ferguson?",
  "37129": "Can it be that he was ashamed of me?",
  "37130": "Is it true, mother?",
  "37131": "Whither?",
  "37132": "Shall I open the secretary?",
  "37133": "In what respect, madame?",
  "37134": "But what is an energumen?",
  "37135": "Who is it bids me hold?",
  "37136": "May I ask where you have taken up your quarters?",
  "37137": "Or, indeed, I might perhaps get a clerkship in a merchant's office?",
  "37138": "Are you a merchant?",
  "37139": "What injury?",
  "37140": "Did I startle you?",
  "37141": "The horse?",
  "37142": "Where did you get THAT idea from?",
  "37143": "Have you ever seen a man hanged?",
  "37144": "Not even your aunt?",
  "37145": "How would it be possible to explain all this to a judge and jury, so that they might neither say that he was dishonest, nor yet that he was mad?",
  "37146": "Why did you not tell me?",
  "37147": "Do you recall her features distinctly?",
  "37148": "At such a tender age could he have been conscious of his uncle's superiority to all those who surrounded him?",
  "37149": "She had a son, that unhappy woman?",
  "37150": "What was the occasion of this excited assemblage?",
  "37151": "But at a tremendous discount, of course?",
  "37152": "You wish to speak to me about the circumstance which has just happened?",
  "37153": "Was I not just telling you I despised it?",
  "37154": "How has this been proved?",
  "37155": "Do you mind?",
  "37156": "What does it say?",
  "37157": "Then this table is free?",
  "37158": "Who raised the money?",
  "37159": "And what might you think?",
  "37160": "Perhaps you dislike it?",
  "37161": "You see all these bags at the back of my cart?",
  "37162": "Whether they were a rich or a poor corporation?",
  "37163": "And how does he behave towards travellers?",
  "37164": "Have you kept in touch with the market while you have been out of work?",
  "37165": "I then asked him what he intended to do with the knife which had been found upon him?",
  "37166": "Have you ever noticed how much a thing is heightened in value when we obtain possession of it?",
  "37167": "But why should he go through the ceremony if he is not to live with her?",
  "37168": "Oh, is that it?",
  "37169": "I do not know?",
  "37170": "And how could he know that I should be such a simpleton as to believe him?",
  "37171": "Are you so unsociable that you cannot make friends?",
  "37172": "Repeal this statute, my good sir?",
  "37173": "Will you make up your mind at last?",
  "37174": "Do I not know human nature?",
  "37175": "Must I wrap them up?",
  "37176": "If he was going to treat her like that why did he ask her to come and live at the flat?",
  "37177": "But how can I send him away, since I have given him a rendezvous?",
  "37178": "H'm?",
  "37179": "Ever so far?",
  "37180": "What are you doing there?",
  "37181": "And how have I broken that treaty, your excellency?",
  "37182": "How are you, old fellow?",
  "37183": "Sister?",
  "37184": "No misfortune has happened to the queen?",
  "37185": "You advise me, then, to be reconciled to the abbe?",
  "37186": "You too come to see them off?",
  "37187": "What is the meaning of yonder singular building?",
  "37188": "Have you brought his indentures with you?",
  "37189": "Is not ambition but an endless ladder by which no height is ever climbed till the last unreachable rung is mounted?",
  "37190": "Are you staying to talk?",
  "37191": "In what relation must she salute you as her uncle, or as her husband?",
  "37192": "Do the races or species of men, whichever term may be applied, encroach on and replace one another, so that some finally become extinct?",
  "37193": "Your crime?",
  "37194": "What have I been waiting for?",
  "37195": "Morrel?",
  "37196": "Or what does she mean?",
  "37197": "Has he got the financial basis arranged then?",
  "37198": "A little?",
  "37199": "Who goes there, yourselves?",
  "37200": "Will nothing of it remain?",
  "37201": "What will we get?",
  "37202": "But what's the use of talking of gorgeous rooms?",
  "37203": "Why did you sin?",
  "37204": "What necessity was there to expatiate on her brother's drunkenness?",
  "37205": "Could we lend you anything?",
  "37206": "I hope number two's as good?",
  "37207": "Are they weighing the shekels of the tabernacle ?",
  "37208": "Is it all past over?",
  "37209": "My heart, who is there upon earth that I could miss so much?",
  "37210": "If it is I you do love, O how can it be that you look and speak so?",
  "37211": "Shall I clamber across, or will you come to the plank above here?",
  "37212": "Have they calculated upon the inevitable consequences of this abdication?",
  "37213": "Plural?",
  "37214": "Why no king?",
  "37215": "Why had her family cast her off?",
  "37216": "And what will you do in that case?",
  "37217": "Why?",
  "37218": "Were they good to you?",
  "37219": "And why not?",
  "37220": "Whither shall I fly?",
  "37221": "Where is such an education as this to be had?",
  "37222": "Have you any more business here?",
  "37223": "You would follow the escort?",
  "37224": "Are you superhuman?",
  "37225": "But what good effect can the latter mode of worship have on the moral conduct of a rational being?",
  "37226": "Why, how, when my money is gone, my complexion gone, my life gone, and my slipper gone?",
  "37227": "Do we desire to make such ruthless combinations and monopolies lawful?",
  "37228": "Whose sword?",
  "37229": "There, do you hear?",
  "37230": "You do believe in my grandmother, then?",
  "37231": "Do you feel ill, sir?",
  "37232": "How did that ivory come all this way?",
  "37233": "Is there confusion in the little isle?",
  "37234": "What lay behind it or within it?",
  "37235": "Why have they not been here?",
  "37236": "But, doctor, you are not going to quarrel with us?",
  "37237": "What the devil are you driving at?",
  "37238": "When did it come to your knowledge?",
  "37239": "You do not comprehend ?",
  "37240": "Do you swear it?",
  "37241": "With your lasso you could stop an ox?",
  "37242": "Why, what do you call yourselves?",
  "37243": "And the corpse?",
  "37244": "You will give me your hand, will you not?",
  "37245": "Was it a girl or a boy?",
  "37246": "From whom?",
  "37247": "Why had she bidden him to come early if she was having people to dine?",
  "37248": "Was it yesterday?",
  "37249": "Shall I see something very uncommon?",
  "37250": "Could she see?",
  "37251": "Are those all they've left us?",
  "37252": "All?",
  "37253": "Where was now the dwarf?",
  "37254": "Was that so?",
  "37255": "What hideous, furtive hand is that which is slipped into the pocket of victory?",
  "37256": "Do you know who the other is?",
  "37257": "And does the essence of the invariable partake of knowledge in the same degree as of essence?",
  "37258": "And do you wish to behold what is blind and crooked and base, when others will tell you of brightness and beauty?",
  "37259": "Why will you ask me to do these things?",
  "37260": "With what view?",
  "37261": "What have you against me?",
  "37262": "Are you going much farther?",
  "37263": "How nothing?",
  "37264": "Were you in that lighter?",
  "37265": "What came of such an event?",
  "37266": "Why stop?",
  "37267": "And how long has this been going on?",
  "37268": "As soon as may be?",
  "37269": "Are we descending?",
  "37270": "First of all, if he had left it complete, would sixteen years have gone by before it was printed?",
  "37271": "Where would you put this?",
  "37272": "Who insists?",
  "37273": "Do they droop and end their lesson, wearied over there beyond the seas?",
  "37274": "Or to do anything?",
  "37275": "Why, is that your name?",
  "37276": "Wherefore ruin so fair a body?",
  "37277": "And who was the first?",
  "37278": "Do you promise?",
  "37279": "She is modest enough to love even you?",
  "37280": "Where then was my guardian angel?",
  "37281": "You insist on pistols?",
  "37282": "What IS that truck?",
  "37283": "What row?",
  "37284": "If it had not been for that lucky waggon, who knows what would have happened?",
  "37285": "What is the reason of all this?",
  "37286": "And why did he bob and beat you, sirrah?",
  "37287": "What collection of facts is scanty?",
  "37288": "How shall the government, which by the hypothesis is everything, become an obedient servant, a subordinate organ?",
  "37289": "Corney?",
  "37290": "But you will be at the games?",
  "37291": "Is it really you?",
  "37292": "Love it?",
  "37293": "What shall I do, mamma?",
  "37294": "What's all this about diamonds?",
  "37295": "Why did you come between my love and me?",
  "37296": "When such as I, who have no certain roof but the coffinlid, and no friend in sickness or death but the hospital nurse, set our rotten hearts on any man, and let him fill the place that has been a blank through all our wretched lives, who can hope to cure us?",
  "37297": "He has obtained the decoration for me?",
  "37298": "If that be so, what must she think of me if I stay away from her now?",
  "37299": "Shall it be a week, a month, a year?",
  "37300": "But if they had quarrelled so bitterly, why had her father the very next day urged her to marry him?",
  "37301": "What is to be done?",
  "37302": "Was she paintable?",
  "37303": "And then, whither was he to go?",
  "37304": "How long have I been mad?",
  "37305": "Why have we no father, like other boys?",
  "37306": "Who would recognize him now?",
  "37307": "And when was the engagement actually settled?",
  "37308": "You have never been a companion before, have you?",
  "37309": "How did you hear of him?",
  "37310": "Why should they not do good?",
  "37311": "Where, then, lies the solution of the social problem?",
  "37312": "Then there is no cure for it?",
  "37313": "Does not this appear strange to you?",
  "37314": "And, anyway, how did he know?",
  "37315": "How is it you're only just qualified?",
  "37316": "What book?",
  "37317": "Bobbsey?",
  "37318": "Are you a subject for the mad hospital?",
  "37319": "Left, why did you leave?",
  "37320": "Why did you not say so?",
  "37321": "Whuzzit you wammme do?",
  "37322": "And living in this way we shall have much greater need of physicians than before?",
  "37323": "Why, had they not been sailing persistently to the east?",
  "37324": "Could you raise a flower here, do you reckon?",
  "37325": "Fight our way through?",
  "37326": "Me get married?",

  "37328": "Have you made the tour of the mansion?",
  "37329": "What if her fourteen bairns had been resteeped to the hips in poverty by the morbid sentimentality of their father?",
  "37330": "You knew the poor lad, then?",

  "37332": "That's why you are going, is it?",
  "37333": "Do you dance?",
  "37334": "Has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant?",
  "37335": "What depth have we?",

  "38215": "I have already recorded sentence of death, five or six times, against the movers of political conspiracies, and who can say how many daggers may be ready sharpened, and only waiting a favorable opportunity to be buried in my heart?",
  "38216": "Then it was not till your return to the ship that you put the letter in the portfolio?",
  "38217": "Are my children all there?",
  "38218": "It seems he addressed the young man first, threatening him with his vengeance for having trespassed on his demesnes, and asking him if he knew in whose presence he stood?",

  "38245": "But the willow bark?",
  "38246": "Can it have been only a momentary mood, and will it pass and leave no trace?",
  "38247": "Why did he not tell them he knew nothing about this affair?",
  "38248": "Was it true what that man said?",
  "38249": "Well, how am I so?",
  "38250": "Tell me also about my father, and the son whom I left behind me, is my property still in their hands, or has some one else got hold of it, who thinks that I shall not return to claim it?",
  "38251": "Does he not look like a clown?",
  "38252": "Would you have acted differently, captain?",
  "38253": "But you'll come back here after the races, I suppose?",
  "38254": "We get on very well together, you and I, and I've not behaved badly to you, have I?",

  "38258": "Did it not measure about six yards?",
  "38259": "This is the church where she attends mass, is it not?",
  "38260": "Now that I feel nothing, it has stopped, has perhaps gone down again into its darkness, from which who can say whether it will ever rise?",
  "38261": "Do you wish to turn her out of your home?",
  "38262": "Are you making fun of me?",
  "38263": "What is it that I can do then?",
  "38264": "And why, sire?",
  "38265": "Is the ocean spread above our heads?",
  "38266": "And why presently?",

  "38282": "Could I behold this and live?",
  "38283": "What document?",
  "38284": "What could she say?",
  "38285": "Is it as bad as that?",
  "38286": "Was that all that prevented you?",

  "38306": "Do you never catch cold?",
  "38307": "At it again?",
  "38308": "I married?",
  "38309": "In this flowing stream then, on which there is no abiding, what is there of the things which hurry by on which a man would set a high price?",
  "38310": "If this be so, how can I, who love you, wish for such a marriage?",
  "38311": "What has happened, dear lady?",
  "38312": "Why is all this, except from the utter ignorance as to the simplest laws of their own animal life, which prevails among even the most highly educated persons in this country?",

  "38317": "And why not, captain?",
  "38318": "What do you mean by using the will properly?",
  "38319": "How, then, shall we find the relation between two unknowns which, according to political economy, cannot be determined?",
  "38320": "Where are you taking him at that speed?",
  "38321": "Where are the other papers?",
  "38322": "Can he box?",
  "38323": "And why had she made it so cold?",

  "38325": "Do you remember your promise yesterday to give me a kiss?",
  "38326": "What is a guardian for?",
  "38327": "You swear to me, my father, that no danger threatens him if he comes?",
  "38328": "Do you not think that there are things which you cannot understand, and yet which are, that some people see things that others cannot?",
  "38329": "How could that be, if the cost of the national workshops is higher than that of the free workshops?",
  "38330": "Well then, you must know I mean have you had any desire to do what cannot be avoided?",
  "38331": "On what, then, have you relied, legislators?",
  "38332": "Have you never felt one little bit of what you used to feel when we were at the dairy?",
  "38333": "Is no distinction to be made in the intensity of desires?",
  "38334": "Willoughby, where was your heart when you wrote those words?",
  "38335": "And now I'm all right again?",

  "38376": "Professor, are you in earnest, or is it some monstrous joke?",
  "38377": "Not even you?",
  "38378": "Whether the punishment will be greater on him, who, in this case, innocently dies, or on him whom sad necessity forces to retaliate, is, in the nicety of sensation, an undecided question?",

  "38507": "How much may it come to?",
  "38508": "Ye preach patience with what is earthly?",
  "38509": "And you laid the foundation of your fortune in the midst of all those songs?",
  "38510": "Would it be a very hard lesson, dear?",
  "38511": "But how did you become concerned in this villainous affair?",

  "38520": "Whereabouts were his former haunts?",
  "38521": "Will you stop smiling in that inscrutable way and tell me what you mean?",
  "38522": "Whose is that letter of your mistress?",

  "38576": "Not in this place, surely?",
  "38577": "For why should the slaughter of an ox or a sheep be a greater wrong than the felling of a fir or an oak, seeing that a soul is implanted in these trees also?",
  "38578": "Did not your majesty say so?",
  "38579": "Have I your leave to go, dear?",
  "38580": "But are your beliefs, we should ask, based on historical fact?",
  "38581": "Tell me what?",
  "38582": "Glory waits our toil?",
  "38583": "Am I queer?",
  "38584": "So much?",
  "38585": "So that you may be avoided?",

  "38748": "Ah, what IS it, now?",
  "38749": "If you're not then, where's your faith?",
  "38750": "Does that suggest anything to you?",
  "38751": "In what?",
  "38752": "Worked in the yards before?",
  "38753": "Shall I not read now?",
  "38754": "And if once there has been love, if they have been married for love, why should love pass away?",

  "38815": "Here is a fellow, who, infected by the most pestilent and blasphemous code of devilry that ever was known, abandoned his property to the vilest scum of the earth that ever did murder by wholesale, and you ask me why I am sorry that a man who instructs youth knows him?",
  "38816": "Heh?",
  "38817": "Was she kinder, now?",
  "38818": "Then let me ask you to consider further whether the world will ever be induced to believe in the existence of absolute beauty rather than of the many beautiful, or of the absolute in each kind rather than of the many in each kind?",

  "38827": "Shall I call on him as I pass?",
  "38828": "Have you not much more?",
  "38829": "Then the world cannot possibly be a philosopher?",
  "38830": "Must we not ask who are to be rulers and who subjects?",
  "38831": "My dear girl, would it not be carrying the experiment unnecessarily far?",

  "39356": "What danger?",
  "39357": "I wonder where I shall find a glass retort large enough to contain such a vast quantity of tinder, the consumption of which must, undoubtedly, raise the price of paper, or where shall I find animal heat sufficient even to warm such a mass?",

  "39451": "What is it you depend on?",
  "39452": "And how am I to do so?",
  "39453": "And what do you make of it?",
  "39454": "But could a child of that age have a soul like that?",
  "39455": "Let him slip through our hands?",
  "39456": "Maggie only worst then?",

  "39486": "Have you never loved ANYBODY in all your life, uncle?",
  "39487": "Will you pay me, sir?",
  "39488": "Is she gone?",
  "39489": "Tom?",
  "39490": "Who was the better for it?",
  "39491": "How long is it since I rented your house?",
  "39492": "Oh, that's the trouble is it?",
  "39493": "Has she heard?",
  "39494": "Why do you wish to know?",
  "39495": "Could he not squeeze under the seat of a carriage?",
  "39496": "Or what does he know about anything for that matter?",
  "39497": "Do you mean to refuse me altogether?",
  "39498": "Why do you ask?",
  "39499": "Is not death in my house?",
  "39500": "There is not room for one more?",
  "39501": "Has your debt been paid you?",
  "39502": "Then what brought you among our enemies?",
  "39503": "Have I at least convinced you, sire?",
  "39504": "A crook?",
  "39505": "What am I to say to her?",
  "39506": "All this time?",
  "39507": "Do you admit that education is a benefit for the people?",
  "39508": "So will you, PLEASE will you, keep from questioning me?",
  "39509": "And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose?",
  "39510": "The murderer?",
  "39511": "And to attend the court no more?",
  "39512": "And have you been here long?",
  "39513": "What have I done, and what could I do?",
  "39514": "Who is mourning for the daughter?",
  "39515": "Will it hurt?",
  "39516": "Has there been any paramour who disgraced himself that lie might help his neighbours?",
  "39517": "But, comrades, what shall we do now?",
  "39518": "About what, mother?",
  "39519": "If this assertion be true, is it not a useless task to educate man with the purpose of making him better and nobler?",
  "39520": "Where was it?",
  "39521": "In such cases, who is to decide, the living or the dead?",
  "39522": "How did that come about?",
  "39523": "Not going at all?",
  "39524": "Did you say those words to her?",
  "39525": "Whuzzamatter whiz you?",
  "39526": "Gentle count, brave soldier, where are you?",
  "39527": "But why this question?",
  "39528": "Was it not too horrible?",
  "39529": "You really think so?",
  "39530": "Had you doubted it, then?",
  "39531": "Do you hear how he's walking?",
  "39532": "But why do I argue thus?",
  "39533": "A letter?",
  "39534": "You mean of family ties?",
  "39535": "Did she eat or drink here?",
  "39536": "What in the devil is the matter with you, my friend?",
  "39537": "How then?",
  "39538": "Do you know it or not?",
  "39539": "You see, I destroy it?",
  "39540": "Will you not wait and breakfast?",
  "39541": "To refresh me?",
  "39542": "Are you supporting them also?",
  "39543": "This varnish?",
  "39544": "And on what floor does he live?",
  "39545": "Why so positive?",
  "39546": "Has he ever whaled it any?",
  "39547": "And, more especially, can he pass unfriendly legislation to violate his oath?",
  "39548": "Who's here?",
  "39549": "Now, when he is in this state of mind, if some one gently comes to him and tells him that he is a fool and must get understanding, which can only be got by slaving for it, do you think that, under such adverse circumstances, he will be easily induced to listen?",
  "39550": "What shall be said of these?",
  "39551": "You cannot tell me?",
  "39552": "Where'd you get the blue ticket?",
  "39553": "Surely will my last night's dream be realised?",
  "39554": "Where was he going?",
  "39555": "Stoepel?",
  "39556": "But why should I be there rather than in this beautiful room?",
  "39557": "How well are the machine sheds at the barracks guarded?",
  "39558": "Had you had a row?",
  "39559": "What has it all been about?",
  "39560": "Why did you not darken your light, that he might be stricken with horror at his crime?",
  "39561": "After this?",
  "39562": "Before the boy comes?",
  "39563": "But why need I wear spectacles?",
  "39564": "Where then do you mean to take refuge?",
  "39565": "What are you going to do with him, assuming that you've got him?",
  "39566": "After a pause of several minutes, their silence was broken, by his asking her in a voice of some agitation, when he was to congratulate her on the acquisition of a brother?",
  "39567": "And what did you say to her?",
  "39568": "Why mine?",
  "39569": "Did no one examine?",
  "39570": "Would that be right?",
  "39571": "And how did you verify them?",
  "39572": "Will you be frank, very frank with me?",
  "39573": "Whither should I go?",
  "39574": "Now tell I tell you something?",
  "39575": "Whose voice was that?",
  "39576": "What will happen, then?",
  "39577": "Did he give his name?",
  "39578": "And where is the consulate?",
  "39579": "Why does he let things be so?",
  "39580": "Singly?",
  "39581": "Mary what, then?",
  "39582": "Are you going?",
  "39583": "I suppose you were a gentleman, then, as well as now?",
  "39584": "Will you be pleased to hang me?",
  "39585": "Camp in a bog, would you?",
  "39586": "Ah what's this I smell?",
  "39587": "And why am I disturbed, for the dispersion of my elements will happen whatever I do?",
  "39588": "Do you doubt it?",
  "39589": "But why not, my dear?",
  "39590": "But how did he account for it?",
  "39591": "Danae means a shower of gold, does it not?",
  "39592": "And in that case they will be right in doing good to the evil and evil to the good?",
  "39593": "Would I reflect on the price?",
  "39594": "Does anyone know where it is?",
  "39595": "Perhaps, gentlemen, if he had not said this in your presence and I had reported it, you'd have held this to be impossible likewise, eh?",
  "39596": "As to arming them, how is that to be done?",
  "39597": "How long ago?",
  "39598": "What pickpockets are they who ply their trade in the rear of glory?",
  "39599": "Will not the three men be found?",
  "39600": "What are they doin' THERE, for gracious sakes?",
  "39601": "How is it that that name rises upon all occasions to torment my ears, during the last two or three days?",
  "39602": "Or maybe it is that monsieur does not care to hunt marauders?",
  "39603": "To keep her in?",
  "39604": "And what do you?",
  "39605": "First, you are sorry for what you've done, and you see the folly of it all?",
  "39606": "Are they or their descendants to embrace our faith?",
  "39607": "Where is the church?",
  "39608": "Nor by reason of a knowledge which advises about brazen pots, I said, nor as possessing any other similar knowledge?",
  "39609": "Who shall judge of the continuance of the danger?",
  "39610": "Are you sure we are alone?",
  "39611": "Are you quite sure that this is a man, or that he has ever been one?",
  "39612": "Who said it?",
  "39613": "The queen wears the rosette?",
  "39614": "To give him an opportunity or making some of his severe remarks and moral reflections, and to undo what we had so much trouble in effecting?",
  "39615": "Pannus, pro quo supponit?",
  "39616": "Swann?",
  "39617": "But is there any doubt as to what he will do on the prominent questions if elected?",
  "39618": "Do you count that as nothing?",
  "39619": "Was it religion that prompted him to cannibalism?",
  "39620": "But do you say he will marry you?",
  "39621": "Their feet?",
  "39622": "Wha will bind up the brags of weir?",
  "39623": "Is he still here?",
  "39624": "The thing was proven upon him?",
  "39625": "Do you feel rather easier?",
  "39626": "Where are the matches?",
  "39627": "Then, for all your valour, you would save your life?",
  "39628": "Guilty of what?",
  "39629": "Why, is any day old and new?",
  "39630": "Nor would you say that medicine is the art of receiving pay because a man takes fees when he is engaged in healing?",
  "39631": "You have, at least, money to receive, as you have an order?",
  "39632": "How she does?",
  "39633": "What does he feel?",
  "39634": "Why are they turned out?",
  "39635": "Very decided character there, sir?",
  "39636": "Remain here?",
  "39637": "Where is he?",
  "39638": "How long have you been here?",
  "39639": "Can he hear my word?",
  "39640": "Where is it then?",
  "39641": "Which would you like best for me to make you, a little cake and bless you, or a big cake and curse you?",
  "39642": "His flatterers?",
  "39643": "Reward?",
  "39644": "How shall I bear it?",
  "39645": "Shall we go up and join my mother?",
  "39646": "What made you suppose we should be?",
  "39647": "In gold, silver, or notes?",
  "39648": "But the sympathies of the latter were with the mother?",
  "39649": "What money have we?",
  "39650": "The election came, and what was the result?",
  "39651": "There is no exit?",
  "39652": "You know what a file is?",
  "39653": "A very strange one?",
  "39654": "Did you know that I have a son?",
  "39655": "You are the cure, are you not?",
  "39656": "You see this foot?",
  "39657": "A rabbit?",
  "39658": "Direct?",
  "39659": "Where have you been so long?",
  "39660": "But is it possible that we are not all associated?",
  "39661": "Who can it be?",
  "39662": "Can you say the person who fought many a sanguinary battle, who got through many cunning negotiations with enemies and friends, who personally experienced the troubles of polygamy, was a person sinless and divine?",
  "39663": "Quite well?",
  "39664": "Which makes in my coffers?",
  "39665": "My dear boy, I hope you are not worn out?",
  "39666": "You do not think we would harm you?",
  "39667": "Hempseed?",
  "39668": "But you will go to heaven, mamma, and why should I not speak of it?",
  "39669": "How could a little chap like me hurt so many people?",
  "39670": "And who served under an assumed name?",
  "39671": "Have you another as good?",
  "39672": "Are you sleepy, darling?",
  "39673": "How was he dressed?",
  "39674": "Why ask this grace?",
  "39675": "But, my dear child, do you mean to say you could not love me if I had some other name?",
  "39676": "I will do well?",
  "39677": "Are you not going to wait until we bring the hostages?",
  "39678": "Sit down in your presence?",
  "39679": "I trouble YOU?",
  "39680": "You dismiss me, monsieur?",
  "39681": "Your father's not at home, I think, is he?",
  "39682": "And do you want to know where I found it?",
  "39683": "Do you mean the sorrel horse?",
  "39684": "Do you like me at all?",
  "39685": "Why these cries?",

  "40475": "What would you have, my friend?",
  "40476": "Will they attack, do you think?",
  "40477": "Do you wish, in order to prevent business stagnation, to limit production strictly to the necessary amount?",
  "40478": "To see fashions?",
  "40479": "This plan was all very well, but how was it to be put into execution ?",
  "40480": "Should his request be granted, who would you like as his successor?",
  "40481": "What for?",
  "40482": "If a ship had passed near by us what would the sailors have said?",
  "40483": "Anna, why distress yourself and me so?",
  "40484": "You admit attacking the plaintiff?",
  "40485": "Who would employ a boy of my age on a farm or in a factory?",
  "40486": "And what sort of a picture would that make?",
  "40487": "What is the matter with you, my dear?",
  "40488": "But why should I be amused?",
  "40489": "What are these warnings?",
  "40490": "Is it so terrible to be old?",
  "40491": "Will you tell me where you are going, you wretch?",
  "40492": "Did I make a contract with him in the forest, and sign it with my blood?",
  "40493": "Ah, she likes to be liked?",
  "40494": "What makes you talk like that?",
  "40495": "Where can I go?",
  "40496": "Where is MY home?",
  "40497": "Did you hear that?",
  "40498": "Whom shall I announce?",
  "40499": "Said I not rightly that we are a wonderful people?",
  "40500": "To whom is she to be married?",
  "40501": "And are suits decided on any other ground but that a man may neither take what is another's, nor be deprived of what is his own?",
  "40502": "How did you bear your disappointment?",
  "40503": "And you have learned nothing from any other quarter?",
  "40504": "But in what consists this preference?",
  "40505": "And the prince was pleased with you?",
  "40506": "How do we learn anything at all?",
  "40507": "But what about this interminable war?",
  "40508": "And the spider?",
  "40509": "What were they?",
  "40510": "Now what do you think of that?",
  "40511": "Can he bring a suit against him to recover his business and property?",

  "40513": "Where was she?",
  "40514": "Am I rude?",
  "40515": "Will you admit so much?",
  "40516": "Well, are you having a pleasant journey?",
  "40517": "Have you no present interest in any of the company who occupy the sofas and chairs before you?",
  "40518": "What is the lowest you will take for him?",
  "40519": "And why expose his own children in the battle?",
  "40520": "Look here, young man, are you sure you've no idea where your sister is?",
  "40521": "Are there lights in the windows?",
  "40522": "So you've been here a whole hour?",
  "40523": "Now, follow that passage with your eye, and tell me whether it distinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that he was instructed by his legal advisers wholly to reserve his defence?",
  "40524": "How could I live an alien in that house where I had been the child?",
  "40525": "Shall you stay there?",
  "40526": "Who has not heard of the hardest drinker in all the army?",
  "40527": "Would it be kindness?",
  "40528": "And how shall we manage the period between birth and education, which seems to require the greatest care?",
  "40529": "How do you know she has?",
  "40530": "It was running wild after the girls may be?",
  "40531": "He sent some one?",
  "40532": "Who would know so well as you how to teach the lesson of endurance to others?",
  "40533": "Did I not think so?",
  "40534": "By making them stronger for each other's aid, will you make her less willing to discharge a lighter than a greater responsibility?",
  "40535": "But when your father comes back tomorrow what am I to tell him?",
  "40536": "Oh, do you then know him?",
  "40537": "And you think it quite right?",
  "40538": "Then, again, within the city, how will they exchange their productions?",
  "40539": "Believe what?",
  "40540": "Now, my boy, which house is it?",
  "40541": "Perhaps, concerned only for his imminent doom, he had not had sincere sorrow for his sin?",
  "40542": "How can we help?",
  "40543": "How could a man like him be expected to have any pleasure in such a discovery?",
  "40544": "So it was YOUR cry of distress that I heard?",
  "40545": "But do you suppose that if I had been I should have asked you to let me go and live with him?",
  "40546": "Are you coming?",
  "40547": "Is it strife?",
  "40548": "What needs he the defence this arm can make?",
  "40549": "Do I understand it?",
  "40550": "What about the general?",
  "40551": "Your brother was, I believe, unmarried, was he not?",
  "40552": "What will the archbishop think of that?",
  "40553": "Less pedigree?",
  "40554": "What was then to be done?",
  "40555": "Why did not you all learn?",
  "40556": "Does it apply well to my suit?",
  "40557": "You mean my mother?",
  "40558": "What does he think I can do with his five francs?",
  "40559": "What lunacy are you talking?",
  "40560": "How could he hope ever to grow up to be as good and wise as they, or even tolerably good and wise?",
  "40561": "Lie down?",
  "40562": "Why not, my love?",
  "40563": "More smart, is it?",
  "40564": "Can it be with me?",
  "40565": "Lord?",
  "40566": "What is the matter with you that you know them?",
  "40567": "What does he mean by using a shotgun when silence was his one chance of escape?",
  "40568": "Is the time ripe now?",
  "40569": "What will be our future condition if he should beget other suns?",
  "40570": "But why are we standing here?",
  "40571": "But who knows, madam, but somebody that shall be nameless would like me best with all my little finery about me?",
  "40572": "Why had he wasted his time hunting?",
  "40573": "In the hat?",
  "40574": "What is there in your mind?",
  "40575": "You really love, then, no lady at this court?",
  "40576": "Will she be safe over there?",
  "40577": "Have you a mind to teach the beavers to sing?",
  "40578": "Why was this?",
  "40579": "What have you got to say next?",
  "40580": "How soon can he be here?",
  "40581": "Now, what DO you want to buy?",
  "40582": "How you come to fall out?",
  "40583": "Will he come again?",
  "40584": "Where have you put it?",
  "40585": "Can you provide that they shall be separated at bed and board?",
  "40586": "Did anything happen this time?",
  "40587": "Where does my father get all that iron rust from?",
  "40588": "And you choose that time for grazing?",
  "40589": "Fifteen shillings a week not much, young man?",
  "40590": "If I could do that, simpleton, where would the danger be?",
  "40591": "A natural death is better than an artificial life, surely?",
  "40592": "Children dear, were we long alone?",
  "40593": "Is this number seven?",
  "40594": "Why do you suppose that I should look severely on your affection for that young man?",
  "40595": "Is this a weather to send benevolence?",
  "40596": "Who was the criminal, then?",
  "40597": "And what reason is that?",
  "40598": "Where was the difficulty?",
  "40599": "What do I care about blood?",
  "40600": "What is that stupid fellow troubling himself about?",
  "40601": "Is this a preparation for immortality?",
  "40602": "Had I ever seen so much loathing and pale horror on one countenance?",
  "40603": "When shall we start?",
  "40604": "Did I, sir?",
  "40605": "And who can tell when these happy hours may return?",
  "40606": "We were saying that the parents should be in the prime of life?",
  "40607": "Are these no capital?",
  "40608": "A little of the wine?",
  "40609": "Why did I at once experience a shock?",
  "40610": "Cannot I cut off the part and restore you by a sweat bath?",
  "40611": "Should art be taken seriously?",
  "40612": "But how are you to get that balance?",
  "40613": "Why this hostility of interests?",
  "40614": "What availed the noise and bustle of cheerful morning, which penetrated even there, to him?",
  "40615": "Have we not tramps and beggars enough already to pester us as we sit at meat?",
  "40616": "When shall it be?",
  "40617": "Can you turn a strain to the ladies, sir?",
  "40618": "Over whom?",
  "40619": "Would not jets of boiling water, constantly injected by the pumps, raise the temperature in this part and stay the congelation?",
  "40620": "What difference would that make?",
  "40621": "Or look you I should play the orator?",
  "40622": "Doth not wealth satiate, and become nauseous, and no longer serve to satisfy or pleasure, or to buy an hour's peace of mind?",
  "40623": "And did you do anything?",
  "40624": "You were going to say, thirdly?",
  "40625": "Do they really, you dog?",
  "40626": "Into a new light?",
  "40627": "Did she want to stay at home?",
  "40628": "Which building?",
  "40629": "But why should I consort, I, a brave man, with the abominable?",
  "40630": "Can you guess, now, what this is?",
  "40631": "Suppose you were a foundling and were shown our faith and yours, and asked for which you would decide, which would you choose?",
  "40632": "And how on earth would she ever manage to hold her tongue during school hours?",
  "40633": "Are we afraid of foreign gold?",
  "40634": "Was it a double tooth, hey?",
  "40635": "And how can it all be done by daybreak?",
  "40636": "After these, what resentment can remain in the heart?",
  "40637": "But if she has so absolutely failed, what then had she done?",
  "40638": "And you remember, too, the period when he began to grow fatter?",
  "40639": "What is nature?",
  "40640": "What was it that was borne in upon my mind when she stood still and looked attentively at me?",
  "40641": "And you're not frightened?",
  "40642": "Are you a politician, friend?",
  "40643": "Have you not got all the plants and stones you want?",
  "40644": "What time was it?",
  "40645": "Is it obeying your husband to disobey him on the wital subject of his business?",
  "40646": "On what grounds?",
  "40647": "What is your address in the country?",
  "40648": "How will he ever know the truth, since I shall not tell him of it?",
  "40649": "It was he who rescued you?",
  "40650": "What, for instance, do you mean by all that humbug about the soul?",
  "40651": "Cannot I answer your purpose?",
  "40652": "To whom did he give up his sword?",
  "40653": "Would not that be a sacrifice of higher prospects for you?",
  "40654": "Say, what can cause such impotence of mind?",
  "40655": "But the doctor?",
  "40656": "What business have I with this pipe?",
  "40657": "You have a recipe for it?",
  "40658": "But she?",
  "40659": "Do you know anything about fortifications?",
  "40660": "Is there no merit in repentance?",
  "40661": "What became of you, dear?",
  "40662": "Well, what is to be done, mademoiselle, when so many wills are leagued against me?",
  "40663": "And besides, what is truth to us but the continuous progress of our mind from poetry to prose?",
  "40664": "Is there any point to which you would wish to draw my attention?",
  "40665": "Shall we go in?",
  "40666": "And how would I do it, think you?",
  "40667": "At least we can have a window?",
  "40668": "It was somewhere here?",
  "40669": "Must one die like a dog?",
  "40670": "What does that wagon contain?",
  "40671": "What's the matter with your leg?",
  "40672": "Might not some curious eye fasten on it, and divine its contents?",
  "40673": "What is the difference?",
  "40674": "Who's the other fool?",
  "40675": "Well, do you understand, monsieur?",
  "40676": "You are doing catkins?",
  "40677": "Now, how does a man search a revolving bookcase?",
  "40678": "On what ground do you venture to interfere with me, messieurs?",
  "40679": "What ails ye, man?",
  "40680": "What would be your surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness?",
  "40681": "If you're not coming yourself, give us the cards, will you?",
  "40682": "In the office?",
  "40683": "Ah, precious one, why does your lover live to see you dead?",
  "40684": "Could she be deceived as to the meaning of this?",
  "40685": "Do you really mean to say that that leg of yours is better already?",
  "40686": "Do you not think perhaps that some of the shortcoming lies with yourself?",
  "40687": "Her name?",
  "40688": "How can that be, monsieur?",
  "40689": "What duties?",
  "40690": "And suppose he can obtain his desires, is that so bad as cutting her throat?",
  "40691": "Look here, do you intend to take up you abode with us?",
  "40692": "What do you want to drink now?",
  "40693": "Carey?",
  "40694": "Happy?",
  "40695": "How old are you?",
  "40696": "Is it such as they that we are to follow?",
  "40697": "Do you not think that I also long for forgetfulness?",
  "40698": "What's this?",
  "40699": "What is the captain about?",
  "40700": "Cannot you tell him I will?",
  "40701": "Why had he not let them know that he was still working on the case?",
  "40702": "A ghost?",
  "40703": "Will you work?",
  "40704": "Where have you been, this long, long while?",
  "40705": "What might not have happened to men?",
  "40706": "With what color of propriety could the force necessary for defense be limited by those who cannot limit the force of offense?",
  "40707": "Is it bright?",
  "40708": "How could I know he hated him?",
  "40709": "And all this, for what, I pray?",
  "40710": "Who told you that I loved him?",
  "40711": "Is that what you meant?",
  "40712": "And did I do it for my country's sake?",
  "40713": "Why did you get married?",
  "40714": "But what exactly am I to tell you about them?",
  "40715": "Now where will it be agreeable to you that we hold our conference?",
  "40716": "Why does fate play such tricks with poor, helpless worms?",
  "40717": "Have you ever seen a snake rise up on your path?",
  "40718": "Do passive indolent women make the best wives?",
  "40719": "What would you feel, if a man were faithless to you?",
  "40720": "Has a dog money?",
  "40721": "What do you want there?",
  "40722": "Eliza, girl, what ails you today?",
  "40723": "What is there for me to eat this evening?",
  "40724": "Is there fate amongst us still, send down from the pagan world of old, that such things must be, and in such way?",
  "40725": "Then you had some grounds for supposing he might be the culprit?",
  "40726": "How on earth did you manage to become the favorite of the king, you who have never spoken to him more than twice in your life?",
  "40727": "And your second wish?",
  "40728": "If the view from below had been most interesting and singular, how shall I describe its appearance as seen from above?",
  "40729": "What do you think of a brilliant display of fireworks?",
  "40730": "Are you cold?",
  "40731": "Not so dusty, what?",
  "40732": "Till death itself?",
  "40733": "To defend him would be to accuse herself, would it not?",
  "40734": "But do you think it will rise?",
  "40735": "As bad as all that?",
  "40736": "May it not be spoken except in private?",
  "40737": "For the story?",
  "40738": "But not as a CELEBRITY?",
  "40739": "Is it possible that you do not know that comparisons of wit with wit, valour with valour, beauty with beauty, birth with birth, are always odious and unwelcome?",
  "40740": "When did you first begin this mad career?",
  "40741": "May he share your hopes?",
  "40742": "Would she so?",
  "40743": "Do you place it out at interest?",
  "40744": "I suppose that's why you never got married, uncle?",
  "40745": "But do you know why he did not come, papa?",
  "40746": "Then he is on board?",
  "40747": "Do you find the study of the lower orders interesting?",
  "40748": "Can you make any objection?",
  "40749": "It is quite decided, then?",
  "40750": "What shall I pay you for the body?",
  "40751": "Would he not rather say or do the same as his like in the same case?",
  "40752": "Stryver?",
  "40753": "But how do you and your neighbour get on about the disputed right of way?",
  "40754": "It is possible we may meet again,' and 'will it be of any consequence to you whether we do or not?",
  "40755": "Would he have to abdicate his precentorship, as he had his wardenship, and to give up chanting, as he had given up his twelve old bedesmen?",
  "40756": "What is he waiting for?",
  "40757": "Do you remember that's what you used to call them?",
  "40758": "And where is coldness so ugly as between brothers?",
  "40759": "You know you let me call you so?",
  "40760": "Where is he, then?",
  "40761": "Does the cardinal refuse to receive the king?",
  "40762": "Theurgy, magic, and sorcery?",
  "40763": "What can have happened to them all this time?",
  "40764": "What did you talk about?",
  "40765": "Why on earth do you say that?",
  "40766": "Do you know why it's called a whiting?",
  "40767": "Eyebrows?",
  "40768": "Could I forget them?",
  "40769": "Number and date taken, I suppose?",
  "40770": "Have I not borne secrets heavier than this?",
  "40771": "But, then, accidents?",
  "40772": "Do you think it would be any harm?",
  "40773": "Why not add to the first class the pachydermatous indifference to rebuffs which is of such service to the social climber, and, to the second, taste in dress and the habit of not repeating stories?",
  "40774": "Conrad, what is it?",
  "40775": "Is there nobody here who can sing a song to lighten the time?",
  "40776": "Bless me, how shall I behave?",
  "40777": "What harm can I do to you or to her?",
  "40778": "On me, uncle?",
  "40779": "Somebody has stolen a rabbit?",
  "40780": "Why enter into painful details, so easily divined by the intelligent reader?",
  "40781": "How do you come here?",
  "40782": "Does any answer come out of it?",
  "40783": "How can he find out his strength or weakness otherwise?",
  "40784": "Who's talking o' women?",
  "40785": "Have you never made others labor?",
  "40786": "Ist I will be reueng'd?",
  "40787": "Does he give you sharp answers?",
  "40788": "Do we want to contemplate his mercy?",
  "40789": "What is your theory, then, as to those footmarks?",
  "40790": "And how did you find out?",
  "40791": "Are your things sent off?",
  "40792": "Why did they fancy you?",
  "40793": "Will that suit you?",
  "40794": "Feel what, squire?",
  "40795": "So, then, am I her enemy?",
  "40796": "Saturday?",
  "40797": "How do you keep it on?",
  "40798": "Well, what if there is a trial?",
  "40799": "What are you yourself seeking?",
  "40800": "Would I be quiet and talk rationally?",
  "40801": "Well, what can you do?",
  "40802": "But what would grammar matter if he really loved her?",
  "40803": "Has he marked himself?",
  "40804": "I ask by whose authority?",
  "40805": "Why need he bother about my tuft?",
  "40806": "Farfrae's?",
  "40807": "Are you turning up your noses?",
  "40808": "What then remained?",
  "40809": "You're getting too proud to own me afore company, are you?",
  "40810": "Your father was fortunate, then?",
  "40811": "Do you really believe that such is our aim?",
  "40812": "Could he, as he asked, stop the sea with his hands?",
  "40813": "What has she done?",
  "40814": "I've fretted my gizzard green about it, maister, but what can I do?",
  "40815": "Could it be possible that even now a remnant of that lost race inhabited the ruined grandeur that had once been their progenitor?",
  "40816": "Quite for ever?",
  "40817": "Why do you keep tramping up and down like an old hen?",
  "40818": "Is it ketching?",
  "40819": "Your opinion, if you please, on this difficult matter?",
  "40820": "As her husband was a man of means, and had doubtless returned by this time, could she not send them the money?",
  "40821": "And dark?",
  "40822": "What name would your friend like to put on it?",
  "40823": "What are you going to tell me?",
  "40824": "And if you wished to die, you would choose this death, count?",
  "40825": "What are you doing out of your studio at this hour?",
  "40826": "Is love the only thing?",
  "40827": "For that only?",
  "40828": "And I hope you're good children, are you?",
  "40829": "How was it that no one else saw it?",
  "40830": "In our own house?",
  "40831": "Cannot you inform him that it is frightful earnest?",
  "40832": "Well, what shall we do?",
  "40833": "Well, then, are you the brave captain, are you the valiant blade who dispersed those who wished to burn the condemned?",
  "40834": "Will you please look into the case and restore the old man to his home if the public interest will admit?",
  "40835": "Why should we not imagine this the apartment of an honest mother?",
  "40836": "No bid?",
  "40837": "He comes to live with us?",
  "40838": "Have they come from the town?",
  "40839": "But who told you I was inactive?",
  "40840": "Can you remember any breakfast that I've had today?",
  "40841": "And what are they, captain?",
  "40842": "Well, what of it?",
  "40843": "What am I to do?",
  "40844": "Why did you leave there?",
  "40845": "What can you suppose?",
  "40846": "What drawer or tiring do you mean?",
  "40847": "Did he say whether he had any business to speak about?",
  "40848": "Are you 'fraid of bubbles, too?",
  "40849": "I hope you have preserved the unities, sir?",
  "40850": "Martha knew about you all the time?",
  "40851": "Why did you paint him?",
  "40852": "How could you say that its relation to a knower is the only and fundamental relation for the existence of the tree?",
  "40853": "Come, who is this man who is in the basket?",
  "40854": "Because I like his company?",
  "40855": "How many desperate wretches have I sent to the devil?",
  "40856": "You've got them at last?",
  "40857": "Then why so hurry me?",
  "40858": "Why do you grovel before it?",
  "40859": "Is it all a quite dead garden?",
  "40860": "Now, do you know what all this means?",
  "40861": "Can nothing save him?",
  "40862": "You know his guilt?",
  "40863": "What was that miracle?",
  "40864": "And what may you have to say to him?",
  "40865": "Oh, madam, let me bring you a little something?",
  "40866": "Well, now, what are your conditions, if I employ you?",
  "40867": "You have as good as informed me, sir, that you are going shortly to be married?",
  "40868": "Oh, where is there deliverance from the flux of things and from the 'existence' of penalty?",
  "40869": "Do you think he wants to die?",
  "40870": "The only question was, had she ten or twelve?",
  "40871": "What faces are the most distinct to me in the fleeting crowd?",
  "40872": "What should you prefer?",
  "40873": "Why not, if it amuses him?",
  "40874": "And pray, where do you consider modern music to begin?",
  "40875": "Why do we hate?",
  "40876": "And if she cast it aside, her loyalty, her promise?",
  "40877": "A prisoner?",
  "40878": "But, even relying on his good faith, would be he able to keep his promise?",
  "40879": "Haow soon?",
  "40880": "But what can I do?",
  "40881": "You cannot say what it was?",
  "40882": "And the walks in the avenues?",
  "40883": "Who shall reveal the burning anxiety with which he throbbed to see beyond that cruel wall?",
  "40884": "What will he do?",
  "40885": "To whom shall I give the list of the children's linen?",
  "40886": "What have you said, but that I am to stay a fortnight longer?",
  "40887": "What do you think of a bite of a mouth like that?",
  "40888": "Shall I rise, madam, and pay my duty to my new aunt?",
  "40889": "Emp'ror?",
  "40890": "What other course could it pursue?",
  "40891": "Where's my ulster?",
  "40892": "What to do next?",
  "40893": "Dreadful apparition, why do you trouble me?",
  "40894": "Is she also taken away from me for ever?",
  "40895": "Would not the general loss be too great to justify such relief?",
  "40896": "How many did you get?",
  "40897": "But you like me in spite of it?",
  "40898": "Have you come from a great distance?",
  "40899": "What right have we to argue?",
  "40900": "Have you ever been there?",
  "40901": "With the king's command?",
  "40902": "And is she possessed with a devil?",
  "40903": "Upon what is opinion settled?",
  "40904": "Was it an accident?",
  "40905": "What is the good of all this romancing?",
  "40906": "Why on earth not?",
  "40907": "Montmartre?",
  "40908": "What occasions?",
  "40909": "Know not the living that the grave will swallow them up after a life of sadness and cruel misery?",
  "40910": "So, with the springtime, what was more likely than that the wild idea of escaping had come to him?",
  "40911": "He stopped hard by me, and asked if I knew who he was?",
  "40912": "What could be inside it?",
  "40913": "She is your daughter?",
  "40914": "Where could it a come from?",
  "40915": "A murderous attack?",
  "40916": "Has this place any local appellation?",
  "40917": "Shall I strike it, sir?",
  "40918": "Why do you talk to me like this?",
  "40919": "What can he do here?",
  "40920": "You're not racing?",
  "40921": "Shall it lie unproductive in the public vaults?",
  "40922": "What are you looking at now?",
  "40923": "Why went he there?",
  "40924": "Oh, is that all?",
  "40925": "Or is this not true, is there no such thing as pure accident?",
  "40926": "Alas, who shall now comfort the good margrave's wife?",
  "40927": "That book is quite closed?",
  "40928": "What do you expect me to say?",
  "40929": "Am I?",
  "40930": "Are you happy?",
  "40931": "Why all this coldness, O my best beloved?",
  "40932": "Well, but where have you left the ladies?",
  "40933": "Have you come to meet me?",
  "40934": "And suppose that they were to attack the upper part of the balloon, what would you do?",
  "40935": "May I beg your pardon again, if I inquire what you mean, sir?",
  "40936": "Leave?",
  "40937": "Ever, as long as you live?",
  "40938": "Was ever such an account of a dynasty given?",
  "40939": "Is the cloth taken?",
  "40940": "Adam?",
  "40941": "How did you receive that wound on your face?",
  "40942": "But what did you do yesterday after you left me?",
  "40943": "And the harmonious soul is both temperate and courageous?",
  "40944": "Now, how should I, that ne'er have squealed in your sty, know all the swine therein?",
  "40945": "And what do you suppose it's made of?",
  "40946": "I wonder what's become of her?",
  "40947": "Would you have your husband constantly at your feet?",
  "40948": "Where shall you be yourself?",
  "40949": "Are not the young people growing up today, really dead before they have a chance to live?",
  "40950": "How many times have I told you to tell me at once?",
  "40951": "Is not that so?",
  "40952": "Is it more afflicting to him to leave the graves of his fathers than it is to our brothers and children?",
  "40953": "Do you think it is nonsense?",
  "40954": "And what of passion, or spirit?",
  "40955": "And will you punish him because he cannot become so?",
  "40956": "To you alone, then, may I confide my sorrows and my hopes?",
  "40957": "Now, what do you complain of?",
  "40958": "Shall I be believed?",
  "40959": "Well, and what good would that be?",
  "40960": "How do you propose to deal with the case, sir?",
  "40961": "AIN' dat gay?",
  "40962": "It was you, then, that hit me?",
  "40963": "Who is this?",
  "40964": "What amount is wanting?",
  "40965": "Do all your people grow on bushes?",
  "40966": "Were all the infinitely numerous kinds of animals and plants created as eggs or seed, or as full grown?",
  "40967": "And what is one?",
  "40968": "What the deuce are you driving at now?",
  "40969": "To some old hag?",
  "40970": "Who's he?",
  "40971": "Did she?",
  "40972": "Do you think he'll give us a good ride?",
  "40973": "Then how used you it?",
  "40974": "Shall it be the bride or bridegroom?",
  "40975": "Will he be poison'd with a simile?",
  "40976": "Where are we going to now?",
  "40977": "What, CAPITAL?",
  "40978": "But how shall I leave him dreeft?",
  "40979": "Was she, indeed?",
  "40980": "What am I to do, then?",
  "40981": "Amicable?",
  "40982": "Oh, why did I not tell you all?",
  "40983": "How, if that be so?",
  "40984": "That she ought to go back?",
  "40985": "Possible, my dear?",
  "40986": "Do you want to fight it?",
  "40987": "Have you anything further to say about your friend?",
  "40988": "But what know they more than we ?",
  "40989": "Why do artists, like mechanics, find the means to live?",
  "40990": "Can this be another vengeance of that woman?",
  "40991": "What did he want?",
  "40992": "My new blue coat as I've got on?",
  "40993": "Are you satisfied?",
  "40994": "Was ever such bad luck and such bad management, too?",
  "40995": "What is the fact?",
  "40996": "Where's that huntsman from?",
  "40997": "Why should he leave the comet?",
  "40998": "Would he be in soon?",
  "40999": "Is it her mother you're going to take her to?",
  "41000": "Whatever shall I do?",
  "41001": "What can be the signification of the uneven shrugging of her hulchy shoulders?",
  "41002": "And had he not moved her?",
  "41003": "But are they fully known?",
  "41004": "Secondly, what will satisfy you for the trouble of producing it?",
  "41005": "My dear cousin, can you be satisfied with such a way of spending your probation?",
  "41006": "D'you want to wash?",
  "41007": "Why, what nonsense are you telling us?",
  "41008": "Do you seek any promise from me?",
  "41009": "Or is he dead?",
  "41010": "Parry, is that all?",
  "41011": "What were they about?",
  "41012": "Only a bullet?",
  "41013": "And now that she did own it, what should be her course?",
  "41014": "Now, if competition cannot by itself become the common condition, why should not those for whom it offers nothing but perils, exact guarantees from the barons whom they serve?",
  "41015": "Would its citizens approve of its doing so?",
  "41016": "These relics have a history then?",
  "41017": "This screaming mob, are they, or are they not, my subjects?",
  "41018": "Would it be much out of the way, to take me in, near the great cathedral door between the two towers?",
  "41019": "But how came you to tell me that he was so disagreeable?",
  "41020": "And how did you regulate the matter, let me know?",
  "41021": "Why have you gone out of your mind, like this?",
  "41022": "We may venture on a contest with them, may we not?",
  "41023": "And not talebearers either?",
  "41024": "Is she like him?",
  "41025": "Commission?",
  "41026": "How has he deserved this persecution?",
  "41027": "You will not communicate your letter to me?",
  "41028": "Where the devil can all the shipping be?",
  "41029": "What do you think of that letter?",
  "41030": "What did they say, then, of the disappearance of these gems?",
  "41031": "Everybody?",
  "41032": "Are there many?",
  "41033": "Does preparation advance at all?",
  "41034": "What have any of you cussed cattle to do with thinking what's right?",
  "41035": "Was it really, was it really necessary to have so fresh and young a face, a forehead so shy and always ready to cover itself with the pink blush of modesty in order to pass in the lonely night, in a carriage and pair, accompanied by a mysterious lover?",
  "41036": "Where's the servant whose business it is to answer the door?",
  "41037": "Have they demolished it stone by stone, and uprooted the soil to the last tree?",
  "41038": "What is it about the sight of sheep that excites one so?",
  "41039": "Well, and what are you doing?",
  "41040": "I say, laddie, would you mind getting me a lemonade?",
  "41041": "Was that affair hot?",
  "41042": "What shall we do for music?",
  "41043": "What is the matter?",
  "41044": "Cosa volete?",
  "41045": "What is the gentlewoman?",
  "41046": "Is it not his duty to tell the truth, and nothing but the truth, in order that his subject may stand out unobstructed and shine forth unclouded?",
  "41047": "Were you asked?",
  "41048": "Where is your shelter?",
  "41049": "And what did the officers do?",
  "41050": "I ask, whether she loves him?",
  "41051": "Besides, what was the use of seeing each other?",
  "41052": "It's a wonderful city for scholarship and religion?",
  "41053": "Come, have you committed some crime, pursued by human justice, from which I can protect you?",
  "41054": "And your old parents, are they still living?",
  "41055": "Were you of them?",
  "41056": "Have I said anything to trouble you?",
  "41057": "Have?",
  "41058": "Still at your books?",
  "41059": "How big is it?",
  "41060": "Why are we stopping?",
  "41061": "More often than what?",
  "41062": "What right have you to be happy?",
  "41063": "And you will find traces of poison?",
  "41064": "Shall I begin, ma'am?",
  "41065": "Whither ?",
  "41066": "Do you not then know, child, how you can make the hyena gentle, and the tiger tame?",
  "41067": "Is it that you have almost all finished, or are you speaking always?",
  "41068": "How will it benefit?",
  "41069": "Now what does the king wish?",
  "41070": "Had it been raining all evening?",
  "41071": "Is it possible that not one of all these men will notice me?",
  "41072": "Did you dust this bureau yesterday morning?",
  "41073": "What culpable act have you been guilty of towards me?",
  "41074": "Oh, do you know?",
  "41075": "What were his books to him?",
  "41076": "Do you hear something?",
  "41077": "Does he love you as you deserve to be loved?",
  "41078": "What time might it be?",
  "41079": "What do I mean by that?",
  "41080": "All your arrangements were made?",
  "41081": "So this was the game, was it?",
  "41082": "Of what blood are you, young gentleman?",
  "41083": "Upon what point?",
  "41084": "It is impossible?",
  "41085": "How, then, is life sustained there and kept up in continuous birth after birth?",
  "41086": "I think I may ask, why do you trouble me?",
  "41087": "What could she say?",
  "41088": "What does your worship want to strip for?",
  "41089": "Why did you not say 'no' to the king's suit?",
  "41090": "Have you any chamber on the ground floor where these gentlemen can wait near a good fire?",
  "41091": "Is he not here, then?",
  "41092": "Do you remember you attacked me for seeking enjoyment in life?",
  "41093": "Did I not tell you the lesson I learned over the CHANT HINDOU?",
  "41094": "What marshes?",
  "41095": "I want to know what young man, do you hear?",
  "41096": "Do you mean the gilt cup?",
  "41097": "Where would you have me go?",
  "41098": "To the north or south?",
  "41099": "Why did you think I invited you out here?",
  "41100": "Was each man, of whatever color, entitled to the fruits of his own labor, or could one man live in idle luxury by the sweat of another's brow, whose skin was darker?",
  "41101": "Who's sitting there?",
  "41102": "Where is the mouth that kiss'd me, the breast I laid to my own?",
  "41103": "And where may that be?",
  "41104": "If, as this young man says, the will provides that the proceeds of the property are to be divided into shares, who has the power to alter these provisions?",
  "41105": "They cold?",
  "41106": "What is it more?",
  "41107": "Why, know you what you did by this device?",
  "41108": "Of power superior why should I complain?",
  "41109": "It's you, young ladies, is it?",
  "41110": "How can he know so many dishes, and so fine ones withal?",
  "41111": "What can that be?",
  "41112": "Or shall the magistrates differ as the communities differ?",
  "41113": "Who is?",
  "41114": "Who said I were?",
  "41115": "Now, what did the proletaires wish?",
  "41116": "How old is he?",
  "41117": "And beyond that?",
  "41118": "Was it not well worth my while paying you that slight commission in return for a guarantee of your future silence?",
  "41119": "You are quite happy yourself?",
  "41120": "If she could have been but just created, to discover herself as a spouseless mother, with no experience of life except as the parent of a nameless child, would the position have caused her to despair?",
  "41121": "Will I be in time?",
  "41122": "And how did you find out that they belonged to me?",
  "41123": "Not blows, father?",
  "41124": "Certainly, how is it likely I should know where I should stay?",
  "41125": "I suppose we'd better have dinner?",
  "41126": "And cheerful?",
  "41127": "Whom did you go with?",
  "41128": "Is there not a constant repetition going on of the story of the fable where the storm, blow as it will, cannot tear the cloak from the shoulders of the traveler, while the first warm rays of sunshine make him throw it off immediately?",
  "41129": "Well, what, general?",
  "41130": "Your majesty would condemn me to the lowest, when I have gained the highest?",
  "41131": "The thin, spare man?",
  "41132": "Have you ever met him?",
  "41133": "What's it matter what she says?",
  "41134": "But after that, what did you do, my friend?",
  "41135": "You did not wish to die on the field, you wished to die at home, did you?",
  "41136": "Did he read my letter?",
  "41137": "Do I not know that that is infinite space, and that it is not a round arch?",
  "41138": "And where would they get the money to rescue us if we was to let on we're no worse than other people?",
  "41139": "What will we do, if we get thirsty?",
  "41140": "And win what race?",
  "41141": "Would you ride with me a little way tomorrow morning?",
  "41142": "Tell me, my dear host, if you do not remember this gentleman?",
  "41143": "Should we not feel we had done you wrong, and taken advantage of you?",
  "41144": "Wherefore this desolation of spirit, this anguish of heart?",
  "41145": "And then, no wages, do you hear, my boy?",
  "41146": "But how live in that city?",
  "41147": "Could you?",
  "41148": "How did he get ahead of us?",
  "41149": "But the captain?",
  "41150": "Explain?",
  "41151": "Who is it, I say?",
  "41152": "What news have you brought me?",
  "41153": "Then why was he so overwhelmed now, having seen them as he expected?",
  "41154": "Where then are those people whom you are to have for your auxiliaries?",
  "41155": "Is not all the world against me?",
  "41156": "The gift of a friend?",
  "41157": "What would the subjects of the extracts I should have had to make from books, or even the books themselves, have signified to me?",
  "41158": "Can any reasons be given for the prevalence of any one or all of the methods?",
  "41159": "But do you think as they've done her in, sir?",
  "41160": "Why should he strive?",
  "41161": "If the lady is hurt as bad as you say, who was it that wrote this note?",
  "41162": "Does your mother wash?",
  "41163": "What would you have done if you had had to go into the army, to go and fight beneath the standard?",
  "41164": "Tom, do you believe the man I gave the money to, is really implicated in this crime?",
  "41165": "And whom have you for an advocate?",
  "41166": "Where are you?",
  "41167": "Do innocent men inveigle nameless vagabonds, and prowl with them about the country as idle robbers do?",
  "41168": "Is he coming in?",
  "41169": "Where was the providence of her simple faith?",
  "41170": "Will you be more so when you have sent me away?",
  "41171": "Is't night?",
  "41172": "With my school?",
  "41173": "Would you care for a cup of tea?",
  "41174": "Why should you not?",
  "41175": "Who can say whether we shall ever see them again?",
  "41176": "Well, what am I to do?",
  "41177": "Am I on an island, or is this the sea board of some continent?",
  "41178": "Then turning about towards me, asked what were my commands?",
  "41179": "Has that there little bill of mine been heerd on?",
  "41180": "Why should she think I would reproach her?",
  "41181": "How, then, are we to find her?",
  "41182": "Is it news of my murder?",
  "41183": "As he had a battle to fight, might it not be best to put a bold face upon it?",
  "41184": "And what was the result of those duels?",
  "41185": "Well, who DOES tell you she has?",
  "41186": "Do you mean to say the climate has really any such influence?",
  "41187": "Can you tell?",
  "41188": "May not the same remark be applied to women?",
  "41189": "What so blind as inexperience?",
  "41190": "Roof ever meet, while they are separated by the four walls, that lie in a contrary position?",
  "41191": "Where are the cards?",
  "41192": "And are not her words too true?",
  "41193": "Is there not time enough for that?",
  "41194": "You'll have some meat?",
  "41195": "Well, what's the matter?",
  "41196": "Why should they ask us?",
  "41197": "Is it not a greater wonder that they should be kept up anywhere?",
  "41198": "Why did the old folly end now, and no later?",
  "41199": "Have I been asleep?",
  "41200": "Why did I marry?",
  "41201": "Do you not see that the cannibal has commenced the attack?",
  "41202": "Where will you obtain it?",
  "41203": "Why did you turn aside from your pious practices and good works?",
  "41204": "Orlick there?",
  "41205": "Who comes there?",
  "41206": "Why do you do so?",
  "41207": "You did notice it, then?",
  "41208": "But why at such an hour?",
  "41209": "Gisors?",
  "41210": "Why this precautionary view, she asked herself afresh, when her father had complained, at the very least, as little as herself?",
  "41211": "Why, what ails you?",
  "41212": "Do you care for me?",
  "41213": "Where to get the money?",
  "41214": "Is it because you are sorry for the professor?",
  "41215": "What is that thing there?",
  "41216": "Have you seen the cardinal?",
  "41217": "And if the end were attained, if at last you emerged from the trial ever beautiful and ever young, defying time and evil, and lifted above the natural decay of flesh and intellect, who shall say that the awesome change would prove a happy one?",
  "41218": "What matter, my dear?",
  "41219": "Suppressed, do you say?",
  "41220": "Shall you be in the mill copse?",
  "41221": "Who ever made a stronger stand against the peasants, with writing and preaching, than myself?",
  "41222": "What do you think of him?",
  "41223": "What shall I be?",
  "41224": "My friends, what is to become of me?",
  "41225": "How long are you in town this time?",
  "41226": "Why did I ever know you?",
  "41227": "Surely this passionate lover could not have forgotten her beneath whose feet he wished his ashes to be spread after his death?",
  "41228": "What becomes, during this progressive invasion, of independent cultivation, exclusive domain, property?",
  "41229": "Your diary?",
  "41230": "Who would provide for them and bring them up?",
  "41231": "Does he stay long?",
  "41232": "How did it happen at all?",
  "41233": "Poetry destroyed?",
  "41234": "What was the matter with the boy?",
  "41235": "Have you managed that matter with my aunt?",
  "41236": "Suppose that all these things are desirable, what is the best way of obtaining them?",
  "41237": "Frightened it's got something in it, eh?",
  "41238": "What does he mean by that?",
  "41239": "Prince, my dear?",
  "41240": "Do people utter such enormities, even when they have the misfortune to think them?",
  "41241": "How did that deposit come into my hands?",
  "41242": "How was it that nothing revealed to upright hearts the deceits of infamous hearts?",
  "41243": "How long has he ben dead?",
  "41244": "Do you hear nothing?",
  "41245": "Why did you come alone?",
  "41246": "Apjohn, is there claret there?",
  "41247": "A glass door?",
  "41248": "Shall I not write to you any more?",
  "41249": "Why, what can you be going to send him to a parson for?",
  "41250": "Did I say sharks?",

  "41469": "What sin of mine could merit such a rod?",
  "41470": "Do you even know whether higher prices for articles of luxury would not be an obstacle to the cheapness of necessary objects, and whether, in trying to favor the most numerous class, you would not render the general condition worse?",
  "41471": "Indeed?",
  "41472": "When shall we be there?",
  "41473": "And if they were able to converse with one another, would they not suppose that they were naming what was actually before them?",
  "41474": "What's your name, boy?",
  "41475": "Why does my blood rush into a hell of tumult at a few words?",
  "41476": "But you still know each other?",
  "41477": "But in what does a strong association between a word and an idea differ from a weak one?",
  "41478": "And wha will glove my hand?",

  "41481": "You like that better than all your playthings, eh?",
  "41482": "Yet why be afraid?",
  "41483": "Do you find any dazzling sensation before the eyes?",
  "41484": "It's the right one, I suppose?",
  "41485": "And why wonder at that?",
  "41486": "Why, what is a silhouette party?",
  "41487": "How do you mean, I too?",
  "41488": "What sort of a fatality, in short, is that which is contradicted every instant by the facts which take place within its bosom?",
  "41489": "And do you really love him quite well enough?",
  "41490": "But how did these women bear themselves amid toils so arduous?",

  "41503": "Did he wear a vest?",
  "41504": "Now, do you honestly think they can?",
  "41505": "What is its breadth?",
  "41506": "It's a bad business, eh?",
  "41507": "Do you waltz?",
  "41508": "Have you no place you call a parlour?",
  "41509": "You never intended really to propose to go with me to the altar, and then make yourself rich by one great perjury?",
  "41510": "How could I?",
  "41511": "Are you content with yourself and with your life?",
  "41512": "And what does the author mean to do?",
  "41513": "Was it intentionally?",
  "41514": "May I ask your reason for such an insulting supposition, sir?",
  "41515": "What was the force of that army?",
  "41516": "But of what?",
  "41517": "Do you know where we are going?",
  "41518": "What's the use of it?",
  "41519": "What year?",
  "41520": "But, woe is me, wherefore do I complain?",
  "41521": "Have you a garden of your own?",
  "41522": "Why is not this principle universal?",
  "41523": "And was the sum a large one?",
  "41524": "Why, we are all mortal, are we not?",
  "41525": "Philip, how can you be so unkind?",
  "41526": "Where is he now?",
  "41527": "Will your majesty please proceed?",
  "41528": "And, besides, what is paying it but submission to tyranny?",
  "41529": "But why all this secrecy?",
  "41530": "Oh, gosh?",
  "41531": "Not much in the habit of such travelling yourself, I think, sir?",
  "41532": "But what's the matter with you?",
  "41533": "Besides, what could you have to tell me?",
  "41534": "You know that you are recalled to life?",
  "41535": "Will she be back soon?",
  "41536": "Airing yourself, as I am doing, before you go to bed?",

  "41538": "Is the hand not always pointing there?",
  "41539": "But who was the spy who stole the papers?",
  "41540": "So it's 'Eat my dear birdies,' is it, young man?",
  "41541": "And yet the cardinal was attached to you?",
  "41542": "Can any woman alive believe you in earnest, or think you design anything but to banter her?",
  "41543": "But, such being the case, where could you have heard the same report?",
  "41544": "Why had he not told her everything?",
  "41545": "Who is that BRAHMA?",
  "41546": "What offence did I commit?",
  "41547": "Where am I to find them?",

  "41553": "She will pay, only when?",
  "41554": "Do you mean write it to her?",
  "41555": "How do you make that out?",
  "41556": "Russian books, indeed ?",

  "41564": "Is he not solid gold?",
  "41565": "What are their secret counsels?",
  "41566": "Who'll say a guinea?",
  "41567": "Do you think I particularly like you?",
  "41568": "Who is he, my dear?",
  "41569": "And did you?",
  "41570": "Shall I ever know any thing?",
  "41571": "Where is that murderer?",
  "41572": "Oh, is it broken?",
  "41573": "And is there no room for love there?",
  "41574": "For not alluding to your leaving us?",
  "41575": "What then must be the result?",
  "41576": "What is all settled?",
  "41577": "Saw you those meteors?",
  "41578": "And what will that good treatment be?",
  "41579": "Well, but is there any war on record which was carried on successfully by him, or aided by his counsels, when he was alive?",
  "41580": "Do you want a map?",
  "41581": "But what other is there?",
  "41582": "You understand the rest, then?",
  "41583": "Where were we?",
  "41584": "Would you have 'em both before marriage?",
  "41585": "Why was it?",
  "41586": "What made you choose that particular direction?",
  "41587": "Then the cost of this vessel is great?",
  "41588": "Socrates, has taken possession of you all?",
  "41589": "Have you seen for YOUR self?",
  "41590": "Bore me, my dear?",
  "41591": "How can I ever pay you?",
  "41592": "Give me one little sip more, and tell me from whom you received the noble gift?",
  "41593": "But the orders?",
  "41594": "How here?",
  "41595": "Did he not, my dear father and mother, deserve all the truth to be told?",
  "41596": "You think that likely?",
  "41597": "Can we not better make the attempt after dark?",
  "41598": "Carver, you DO think him witty?",
  "41599": "Giry?",
  "41600": "Why are they leaving the town?",
  "41601": "What is the meaning of that noise?",
  "41602": "And did you go alone?",
  "41603": "What good wind brings you here?",
  "41604": "And if he were dead, to what height of fury would not the violence of the people lash the legionaries?",
  "41605": "You see I am generous, am I not, mother?",
  "41606": "What charm has gone from the twilight?",
  "41607": "What is it, sir?",
  "41608": "And what brought you here?",
  "41609": "Could he have any, do you suppose?",
  "41610": "FOOD FOR THE VULTURES?",
  "41611": "Is it as nice as it sounds?",
  "41612": "You're no wiser than the rest of us, are you?",
  "41613": "Still dreaming and staring?",
  "41614": "How dare you say such things about me?",
  "41615": "Is it not true that legists are governed by caprice in giving and taking away rights?",
  "41616": "Will you go over and get some canned peaches?",
  "41617": "Do not you think that if I were about any king, proposing good laws to him, and endeavouring to root out all the cursed seeds of evil that I found in him, I should either be turned out of his court, or, at least, be laughed at for my pains?",
  "41618": "And you heard nothing, and saw nothing?",
  "41619": "When did he go to church last?",
  "41620": "Which then shall we prefer?",

  "41626": "What infernal noise?",
  "41627": "Jellyby's?",
  "41628": "Do any of you know of one?",
  "41629": "They did not, and why not?",
  "41630": "When do you leave town?",
  "41631": "He knows what YOU know?",
  "41632": "What are you bothering him for?",
  "41633": "What can it be?",
  "41634": "How, sir?",
  "41635": "Whom shall we call, lest spectres should appear?",
  "41636": "Differently?",
  "41637": "And how am I to cross?",
  "41638": "But what am I going to eat?",
  "41639": "How often am I to call you?",
  "41640": "Is it not a source of mortification to a class of men that they are excluded from political power?",
  "41641": "Do you see this parcel?",
  "41642": "A murder do you call it?",
  "41643": "Who does not love you?",
  "41644": "And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?",
  "41645": "How like you her wit?",
  "41646": "Have you got anything of your own?",
  "41647": "But where are the folk?",

  "42053": "And would not the chamberlains have a right to be vexed by it?",
  "42054": "Your majesty has the plan?",
  "42055": "Who would believe this childish discipline, received at eight years old, from the hands of a woman of thirty, should influence my propensities, my desires, my passions, for the rest of my life, and that in quite a contrary sense from what might naturally have been expected?",
  "42056": "Tomorrow?",
  "42057": "Seen her?",
  "42058": "What was that I was saying about denouncing myself?",
  "42059": "Have you got your divorce then?",
  "42060": "Why, what's the matter, trow?",
  "42061": "Monsieur would wish to see my camp, and witness for himself our numbers, and the impossibility of his resisting them with success?",
  "42062": "My friends, do you know what those creatures use for wads?",
  "42063": "Was it worth while, I asked myself, to invent such rubbish at such a moment?",
  "42064": "Is that long ago?",
  "42065": "Ernest was annoyed and surprised, for had not his father and mother been wanting him to be more religious all his life?",
  "42066": "What do you want?",
  "42067": "Oh, was it right my asking him to dinner?",
  "42068": "Will you cause that to be done for me?",
  "42069": "Was his whole life to be shown up as a useless sham a second time?",
  "42070": "Does that please you?",
  "42071": "Kingsford?",
  "42072": "What prevented it?",
  "42073": "Of what nature are they?",
  "42074": "Were they then so many?",
  "42075": "The solemn song be sung ?",
  "42076": "How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains?",
  "42077": "What's the matter, my dear?",
  "42078": "Where's the little scamp got to?",
  "42079": "All right?",
  "42080": "Pardon for whom?",
  "42081": "What does it ALL mean?",
  "42082": "What are those men in those carts?",
  "42083": "Horrid little bird, why did it eat all my starch?",
  "42084": "Surely I was serious enough?",
  "42085": "But above all things, I am a marvel to you?",
  "42086": "Would you like to see them?",
  "42087": "Were you ever up there?",
  "42088": "Was it then that you found her again?",
  "42089": "Of what sort had been the life of the man who had stood for years at the top of a pillar?",
  "42090": "What do you think is the cause of so strange a sound?",
  "42091": "And, as it is our last evening together under quite the same circumstances as during all these weeks, will you agree to a plan of mine?",
  "42092": "Do you know that you have composed some of the most beautiful music in the world?",
  "42093": "Were the distinction or separation of possessions entirely useless, can any one conceive, that it ever should have obtained in society?",
  "42094": "Yet, after all, what is there in it that should surprise us?",
  "42095": "What would you not tell her?",
  "42096": "Not by his daughter?",
  "42097": "Who wants them?",
  "42098": "Ah, why?",
  "42099": "And when this principle measures and certifies that some things are equal, or that some are greater or less than others, there occurs an apparent contradiction?",
  "42100": "There was a row, was there?",
  "42101": "It's you, is it, who played this trick on me?",
  "42102": "To my sister?",
  "42103": "What do you mean to do for me, old fellow?",
  "42104": "Which way are you walking, my love?",
  "42105": "You have, eh?",
  "42106": "You do not mean to say that I have persecuted her?",
  "42107": "What interest have they in your death?",
  "42108": "What the devil made you stand lingering there, in the wet?",
  "42109": "Oh, that's the name of the song, is it?",
  "42110": "Do you know how to sew?",
  "42111": "How, then, could power take up the defence of that which the law did not foresee or define, of that which is the opposite of the rights recognized by the legislator?",
  "42112": "What do you mean by locking the door when decent people come to call upon us?",
  "42113": "Was a miner a good miner?",
  "42114": "Biscarrat is a prisoner?",
  "42115": "She is very amiable, then, is she not?",
  "42116": "Do we not wish for an outlet for our surplus population, if I may so express myself?",
  "42117": "Then, as this is the case, and as the knight did really die, how comes it that he now moans and sighs from time to time, as if he were still alive?",
  "42118": "Why should she spare others?",
  "42119": "What may that mean now?",
  "42120": "If she looked favorably upon another, do you mean, monsieur?",
  "42121": "Was he to make her over, to make any portion of her over to others, if, by doing so, she might be able to share the wealth, as well as the coarse manners and uncouth society of her at present unknown connexions?",
  "42122": "How is this strange silence to be accounted for?",
  "42123": "But, putting that aside altogether, what would they live on?",
  "42124": "But how and where?",
  "42125": "Come, will you take me as I am?",
  "42126": "And wherefore?",
  "42127": "What is the matter with me?",
  "42128": "But, pray, when you have been pumped dry one day, what have you got the next?",
  "42129": "Just a thimbleful of this?",
  "42130": "You'd like to see the room, young man?",
  "42131": "Who knows where the winds will carry this case, and in whose hands it will fall?",
  "42132": "Have we not authorized you to give yourself entirely up to this love?",
  "42133": "The vault under the altar?",
  "42134": "Did he voluntarily ignite his own funeral pyre?",
  "42135": "Well, when can you?",
  "42136": "Is it his own, do you think?",
  "42137": "Is it dread of the unknown?",
  "42138": "She has a carriage, then, this niece of the doctor?",
  "42139": "What would you do then?",
  "42140": "And do you think you will marry?",
  "42141": "And are they going farther westward?",
  "42142": "But what says the scout?",
  "42143": "Onny children?",
  "42144": "Was it warm out there, sonny?",
  "42145": "Not do it?",
  "42146": "Will you employ that sword to spill my blood?",
  "42147": "But supposing you did?",
  "42148": "Where did it lead to?",
  "42149": "Where are the street cars and the motors?",
  "42150": "Quarrelled?",
  "42151": "Would you care to take it?",
  "42152": "For one thing, what do we know of you?",
  "42153": "How much did it cost?",
  "42154": "Have you ever had any experience upon the stage?",
  "42155": "On the jury, are you?",
  "42156": "Your excellency knows him?",
  "42157": "We know that the first has been here, but where are the signs of the other?",
  "42158": "How many chloral tabloids did you take?",
  "42159": "And what injury would they do to others?",
  "42160": "Why does it stop there?",
  "42161": "Are you getting about again yet, old fellow?",
  "42162": "Have you any means of transport?",
  "42163": "Why should you put things so bitterly, dearie?",
  "42164": "The millionaire's mite, eh?",
  "42165": "Are they real?",
  "42166": "And for what purpose?",
  "42167": "Do you suppose the boat will sail promptly?",
  "42168": "What was its standard?",
  "42169": "Do you remember how silent I was on the drive back?",
  "42170": "I ask, therefore, if a man, in this situation, and guilty of these two errors, is to be regarded as vicious and criminal, however unavoidable they might have been?",
  "42171": "Besides, why were they not allowed to escape?",
  "42172": "Were we really there half an hour?",
  "42173": "Does that satisfy you?",
  "42174": "Do you see that, my dear?",
  "42175": "The circumstances?",
  "42176": "Would you imagine it?",
  "42177": "O, is't the custom?",
  "42178": "How many had I?",
  "42179": "What does he want me to do, I wonder?",
  "42180": "What, outside our line?",
  "42181": "You think he has run away, do you, sir?",
  "42182": "That he should appear only at that point?",
  "42183": "What are you saying?",
  "42184": "Foolish indeed?",
  "42185": "Quite strong and well, I hope?",
  "42186": "Is his power of speech gone?",
  "42187": "Would he not have done better to have kept the water that he had decomposed in pure loss, in order to sustain him in the air?",
  "42188": "And he might have asked also, where the industry so necessary for such a trade?",
  "42189": "But if I justify it?",
  "42190": "Was he so awfully hot?",
  "42191": "Where she would be settled?",
  "42192": "Has madame come in yet?",
  "42193": "And which I can have?",
  "42194": "For who would understand the work within him?",
  "42195": "The spider?",
  "42196": "Where can we be going in such a tiny pool of water?",
  "42197": "Had you heard that?",
  "42198": "But what then, made her so unhappy?",
  "42199": "No brother at all?",
  "42200": "The question I have to ask myself is, shall I marry him?",
  "42201": "Have you been dragging the river all day, gentlemen?",
  "42202": "Perhaps two o'clock will suit you better?",
  "42203": "Anyone in the room could get out?",
  "42204": "A dream?",
  "42205": "And his eminence, the cardinal?",
  "42206": "Did you answer it yourself?",
  "42207": "Put 'em ashore like maroons?",
  "42208": "And what does she come worming herself in here for?",
  "42209": "What comes next?",
  "42210": "This prisoner, who was he?",
  "42211": "Do you recollect me?",
  "42212": "The lieutenant of musketeers?",
  "42213": "You wish to be, according to your tastes or private friendships, free to destroy my plans and save my enemies?",
  "42214": "If I be right in this, how could we make any entirely new improvement by means of tonnage duties?",
  "42215": "Wherein differ the sea and the land, that a miracle upon one is not a miracle upon the other?",
  "42216": "Will you leave that spinning wheel be, you young devils?",
  "42217": "You're wretched, he's wretched, and what good can come of it?",
  "42218": "You have received a regular letter of advice?",
  "42219": "What was that awful noise?",
  "42220": "I asked him where he meant to go?",
  "42221": "And light of foot?",
  "42222": "Do you feel unwell?",
  "42223": "What is a fontis?",
  "42224": "And will not their wives be the best women?",
  "42225": "How, then, did you deduce the telegram?",
  "42226": "Why should not my father see him?",
  "42227": "I have heard a party was to leave the encampment this morning for the lake shore?",
  "42228": "What do you call important?",
  "42229": "And, really, what is the result of all this?",
  "42230": "Beg him to come at once, do you hear?",
  "42231": "What do you do in your cottage when it rains like this?",
  "42232": "If so, what we are afraid of, when we but suspect our enemies will inflict it on us, shall we inflict it on ourselves for certain?",
  "42233": "But where are you going really?",
  "42234": "Did not the sun shine upon him with a halo, so that he was bright as an angel?",
  "42235": "No dinner?",
  "42236": "How much does the proprietor increase the utility of his tenant's products?",
  "42237": "You've never worked at anything like this before, have you?",
  "42238": "Did you see us?",
  "42239": "But who could ever repay half the debt we owe you?",
  "42240": "Could he have thrown down the statue after he'd stripped the corpse?",
  "42241": "Shall we say in one hour's time?",
  "42242": "First of all, what did you see?",
  "42243": "Why, where ever did you go?",
  "42244": "You mean the rascals?",
  "42245": "Is it really calling us?",
  "42246": "Do they not think, they will have their own ends, and be truer to themselves, than to them?",
  "42247": "What humour's this?",
  "42248": "How about when you lose?",
  "42249": "But how about the new orbit in which we are moving?",
  "42250": "Shall I lead the way?",
  "42251": "Where was the poor devil to go?",
  "42252": "Would they not willingly sacrifice a little gift in order to obtain everlasting life?",
  "42253": "Where else could he have put it?",
  "42254": "Why are you explaining?",
  "42255": "Why how do you know?",
  "42256": "Well, did he?",
  "42257": "What the deuce have you done with yourself this last month?",
  "42258": "Why should we load ourselves with a useless burden?",
  "42259": "Had he, beneath the childish face, already recognized the passionate, proud woman?",
  "42260": "What is the reward?",
  "42261": "Why, why, why, are there no harbours of refuge for grown men who have not yet lost them?",
  "42262": "To what good?",
  "42263": "Do you know why I came clear out here afoot?",
  "42264": "Is he dead?",
  "42265": "Look here, captain, to speak candidly, do you mean to say that there is anything marvelous in the occurrence?",
  "42266": "What was his purpose?",
  "42267": "There were brave men among them, but of what use was courage when their weapons were powerless against the monster?",
  "42268": "Is it a bargain?",
  "42269": "And in the common way of his business does he not expect to be paid for his pictures?",
  "42270": "Who is this youth?",
  "42271": "Not named?",
  "42272": "How can we truly open the doors, and set free the full genius of our people?",
  "42273": "This what?",
  "42274": "We will go up now, shall we?",
  "42275": "But, it will be asked again, can we on these grounds, admit the existence of a wise and omnipotent author of the world?",
  "42276": "You have taken them away?",
  "42277": "Save it?",
  "42278": "To do with you, my lord?",
  "42279": "What boots it to deplore?",
  "42280": "How do you manage yours?",
  "42281": "What other dreadful things may happen, who can tell?",
  "42282": "How now, what noise is that?",
  "42283": "What is that house, then?",
  "42284": "Did he cut you out?",
  "42285": "You want to know the crime of which you are accused?",
  "42286": "How could we both be deceived?",
  "42287": "How was her girl to have guarded herself from a love so unfortunate, or have avoided the rock on which her vessel had been shipwrecked?",
  "42288": "Do you notice anything about the arrangement of the lamps?",
  "42289": "Can it establish a maximum?",
  "42290": "You take a roundabout way, then, to inform me that I am very ill?",
  "42291": "Shall I myself really have to say it to him?",
  "42292": "What other case?",
  "42293": "Is there any news of game afoot?",
  "42294": "What does it matter to you?",
  "42295": "How much is so applied?",
  "42296": "Why do I find it so hard to breathe?",
  "42297": "Ye must tell us more, whether our dear friends at home be of good cheer?",
  "42298": "Did you find poison, or a dagger, that you look so mournful now?",
  "42299": "What do you think of that plan?",
  "42300": "Do you not feel that?",
  "42301": "You believe, then, the attack will be renewed?",
  "42302": "But why should you?",
  "42303": "What was this grand, eternal pageant to which he had yearned from his childhood up, and in which he could never take part?",
  "42304": "Will nothing alter your decision?",
  "42305": "Were you hit?",
  "42306": "Can you tell me anything about the matter?",
  "42307": "Where did you meet him?",
  "42308": "By what constraint doth the high stoop to the low?",
  "42309": "What was it that opened it?",
  "42310": "And what have we to oppose to them?",
  "42311": "I suppose you work till late?",
  "42312": "Shall my silly heart be pined 'Cause I see a woman kind?",
  "42313": "Suppose he never commits the crime?",
  "42314": "So you knew me all the time, from the first moment I came into the room?",
  "42315": "From what, they asked, could his dissatisfaction arise?",
  "42316": "Is this arrangement satisfactory?",
  "42317": "Are you well?",
  "42318": "Where are you speaking from?",
  "42319": "What need to say that?",
  "42320": "What eye could penetrate into the tower of darkness?",
  "42321": "Has the ministry resigned?",
  "42322": "But how shall we gain the bottom of the sea?",
  "42323": "But suppose they come unarmed?",
  "42324": "But what was she doing?",
  "42325": "Was it from the cold?",
  "42326": "You will not, eh?",
  "42327": "Where should we be going, but home?",
  "42328": "Going home?",
  "42329": "But even apart from that?",
  "42330": "How is it, then?",
  "42331": "Of what consequence was this to them?",
  "42332": "What do they matter to you?",
  "42333": "And the work?",
  "42334": "How can you act this way, dearest?",
  "42335": "What other matters?",
  "42336": "Do you hear?",
  "42337": "How is it that a fatal organization, the organization of humanity, is adventitious, contradictory, full of tumult and catastrophes?",
  "42338": "Shall we not know it?",
  "42339": "What, indeed?",
  "42340": "Guilty?",
  "42341": "What, he had done you the honor to remain here?",
  "42342": "How shall you all fear death if you all know what your friend does not know that he knows?",
  "42343": "Who is that?",
  "42344": "And how long can he rest at the end of his journey?",
  "42345": "You were trying to guess that?",
  "42346": "Cannot you go to the river and drink your fill from the stream?",
  "42347": "Why on earth should two men write a letter in such a fashion?",
  "42348": "Wilfully?",
  "42349": "How long have you been here?",
  "42350": "Or stars and strings?",
  "42351": "You do not?",
  "42352": "Who could fully describe even five minutes of it?",
  "42353": "You want to take my father FROM me?",
  "42354": "Why should I refuse her whom I bear in heart?",
  "42355": "Who's a child?",
  "42356": "How can I possibly treat these poor fellows, who are of some good, at all events, otherwise than as a councilor of parliament?",
  "42357": "And how about a tour abroad?",
  "42358": "Are you mad, you wretch?",
  "42359": "And what is his rank and proper name?",
  "42360": "But can we expect such a king, or, for that is the material point, can we expect a lineal series of such kings?",
  "42361": "How did you get such a huge huge head?",
  "42362": "Was I resigned?",
  "42363": "And you think if I marry, it will be snub?",
  "42364": "Their complexion?",
  "42365": "I will be?",
  "42366": "A good cause might turn the scale with me, for may not I too be of an exceptional brain, congenitally?",
  "42367": "What did you take then at any other?",
  "42368": "Were there many of them?",
  "42369": "How did you escape?",
  "42370": "Will you now comply with my request?",
  "42371": "And the world, you think, would be none the poorer?",
  "42372": "Who can tell them where their father is?",
  "42373": "For how is it probable that he would have been tender of his life, when he was so bitter against his memory?",
  "42374": "Is it to be some panel of philosophers, some fancied posterity, or some other outside authority?",
  "42375": "Could he not feel that letters, eloquence, philosophy, were all degraded in his degradation?",
  "42376": "Got a cigaroot?",
  "42377": "In love with me?",
  "42378": "What is it, then?",
  "42379": "Some good fortune?",
  "42380": "And meantime?",
  "42381": "Whereas he who has a taste for every sort of knowledge and who is curious to learn and is never satisfied, may be justly termed a philosopher?",
  "42382": "But am I not too cold with him?",
  "42383": "Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a lie?",
  "42384": "When do you cease to work?",
  "42385": "Following me?",
  "42386": "What do you here, fellows?",
  "42387": "How will you group the words together according to your new interpretation?",
  "42388": "So much frankness, do you say?",
  "42389": "A big P with a flourish above it, E and N smaller?",
  "42390": "Have you anything to add?",
  "42391": "Yet, after all, who would not envy him?",
  "42392": "Do you?",
  "42393": "Did he still need her, or she him?",
  "42394": "What will it be when he has grown up?",
  "42395": "What am I to do with a stone?",
  "42396": "He was wrong, then?",
  "42397": "But will you let me speak a word or two with you in private?",
  "42398": "When, how, and by what title did they obtain this privilege?",
  "42399": "Morrel?",
  "42400": "What is it you call him?",
  "42401": "Could it ever be?",
  "42402": "Would he be so lost to propriety as to marry her before the year was out?",
  "42403": "Do they think we're dogs?",
  "42404": "Yes, she loved him, or else how could that have happened which had happened?",
  "42405": "Does not the cone of the shadow cast by the earth extend beyond the moon?",
  "42406": "And must it not be looked upon as a sort of warrant for such actions, if I stay after this?",
  "42407": "Would he say dat?",
  "42408": "Was it not wrong?",
  "42409": "You think, then, that I may rely on the count's promises?",
  "42410": "At your house?",
  "42411": "Had he, indeed, been permitted to see a satyr at home?",
  "42412": "Why do philosophers infer, with the greatest certainty, that the moon is kept in its orbit by the same force of gravity, that makes bodies fall near the surface of the earth, but because these effects are, upon computation, found similar and equal?",
  "42413": "In search of what?",
  "42414": "I have no doubt of it, but are these your only reasons for this sudden fancy?",
  "42415": "Do you recognize me at all?",
  "42416": "Expected?",
  "42417": "And in the meanwhile?",
  "42418": "Why did you shake your head?",
  "42419": "And what good can you do her?",
  "42420": "Who is there?",
  "42421": "Was she just a common girl, one who went to seek among the tombs for men who were in sorrow, haunted by the recollection of some woman, a wife or a sweetheart, and still troubled by the memory of vanished caresses?",
  "42422": "And to what part of it?",
  "42423": "She said she was not your wife?",
  "42424": "How are you going to get him down?",
  "42425": "And these things I see suddenly, what mean they?",
  "42426": "Why did she not let me know sooner?",
  "42427": "Because of the numerous court decisions of that character?",
  "42428": "You are a hypocrite, too, are you?",
  "42429": "Then why should this be so?",
  "42430": "Could he not escape from his little house?",
  "42431": "And is it finished?",
  "42432": "Who comes here?",
  "42433": "And your police?",
  "42434": "What signified that disguise?",

  "42838": "What other thing do you think I could dream of doing?",
  "42839": "Which house is it?",
  "42840": "By whom?",
  "42841": "But has the problem been well put?",
  "42842": "Could any thing in womanhood be so vile?",
  "42843": "There were two parts in our former scheme of education, were there not?",
  "42844": "Shall I tell you what I always think of you and the fortune yet to come for you, my love?",
  "42845": "Who is the fellow?",
  "42846": "Pleased to be thus undeceived, I laughed at his consternation, and asked what brought him thither?",
  "42847": "Was he losing his reason and thinking he heard things which were not for human ears?",
  "42848": "How far may the idler take advantage of the laborer?",
  "42849": "Why are you going?",

  "42853": "Genius banished?",
  "42854": "How dare I?",
  "42855": "Well, prince, whom are we to suspect, then?",
  "42856": "I think you had some good reason for giving up the habit of going there?",
  "42857": "What day of the month is it?",
  "42858": "Is he mad, then, that mysterious old fellow?",
  "42859": "But what sort of a sailor are you?",
  "42860": "Who can resist them?",
  "42861": "You think the count will be angry with me?",
  "42862": "But where?",
  "42863": "Did you ever hear the like?",
  "42864": "Who is this man?",
  "42865": "Who wishes you would?",
  "42866": "Is he here now?",
  "42867": "What was it you said to me?",

  "42869": "Am I wanted?",
  "42870": "How came you to be here?",
  "42871": "Can they have gone out?",
  "42872": "Is it of being poor, forsaken, wretched, that you accuse me?",
  "42873": "Did it change her much?",
  "42874": "What was jour offence?",
  "42875": "Who forbade you?",
  "42876": "What is your name, my gentle angel?",
  "42877": "In the sunshine of the morning, beneath the wide, blue heavens, with a fresh wind astir, what fears, except the most desperate, can find a harbourage?",

  "42889": "What am I to say to the creature?",
  "42890": "How would you like to be treated so?",
  "42891": "Is there any one closer to me nor you, or is it likely I'd be listening to stories brought against you?",
  "42892": "And can you not see, sir, the truth that's in me?",
  "42893": "Well, young fellow, are you glad to come to school?",
  "42894": "As how, good signior?",
  "42895": "Has not that been admitted?",
  "42896": "At a registrar's?",
  "42897": "Have you read this bulletin?",
  "42898": "He of whom I have such just apprehensions?",
  "42899": "Did a woman arrive at this place night before last?",
  "42900": "Does anything occur to yourself?",
  "42901": "Then what are they?",

  "42911": "No more than this?",
  "42912": "Where were the keys?",
  "42913": "Nobody know what this fudge can be?",
  "42914": "Come, what is it?",
  "42915": "Is loyalty too weak?",
  "42916": "What result, then, has ensued?",
  "42917": "Would not it be said by my presumptive remorse that, by my gallantry, manner and dress, I was going to seduce her?",
  "42918": "Never before?",
  "42919": "What do you mean, please, by my having 'done' with you?",
  "42920": "To who, sir?",
  "42921": "Did they try it on you?",
  "42922": "Are you thirsty?",
  "42923": "Will monseigneur give me the order?",
  "42924": "Where is the gardener's son now?",
  "42925": "Would it not be well that he should put an end to himself, and thus escape?",
  "42926": "Is it not generous of him?",
  "42927": "What is the matter with you?",
  "42928": "You hear them when the window is open?",
  "42929": "You can?",
  "42930": "Now, what is the good of driblets?",
  "42931": "I'm not come too soon, am I?",
  "42932": "In fact, this bullet must have issued from a firearm, and who but a human being could have used such a weapon?",
  "42933": "Then you sat there like that, just you and she, all by yourselves?",
  "42934": "Why have I not seen you?",
  "42935": "Do you guess the reason?",
  "42936": "Is the one right any better than the other?",
  "42937": "Am I cut off from the last fond pride of meanest shipwrecked captains?",
  "42938": "What is it, uncle?",
  "42939": "Is it my doing?",
  "42940": "To which dialect was he indebted?",
  "42941": "Can you play on the piano?",
  "42942": "You have no money coming in on which you can rely?",
  "42943": "From such a kind family?",
  "42944": "Why did you leave us?",
  "42945": "Who was there among all whom she knew to whom she could appeal for sympathy?",
  "42946": "Well, and you?",
  "42947": "Do I not know that, all the country round, men and woman are calling me the same behind my back?",
  "42948": "Who are these people on the side of the bill?",
  "42949": "But what is it, then?",
  "42950": "But who, then was this man?",
  "42951": "Then they do not know it yet?",
  "42952": "Be so kind as to walk home with him, will you?",
  "42953": "Richard?",
  "42954": "What is a prison?",
  "42955": "Are you sure?",
  "42956": "Oh, will you be quiet, and help me to carry her?",
  "42957": "Have you not read your bulletin?",
  "42958": "Shall domestic manufactures be encouraged, and in what degree, by restrictions on foreign manufactures?",
  "42959": "Or shall we say they may be continued as long as the danger which occasioned their being raised continues?",
  "42960": "Can you tell me any ill he has done?",
  "42961": "What is government?",
  "42962": "How could I forget?",
  "42963": "Hoo wor it?",
  "42964": "But why should they suppose that I despise generals?",
  "42965": "So both the brothers escaped the common fate?",
  "42966": "Where are we to live?",
  "42967": "What reason do they give?",
  "42968": "Do you suppose I want to shoot myself?",
  "42969": "Whether they were always so free from avarice, partialities, or want, that a bribe, or some other sinister view, could have no place among them?",
  "42970": "Is it not good?",
  "42971": "Was that a trick to make me say which one I prefer?",
  "42972": "And get enchanted again?",
  "42973": "Why not, if what you assert is untrue?",
  "42974": "What's the odds where it comes from?",
  "42975": "Could she go back to the former quiet pleasures of those faraway days before the concert?",
  "42976": "Well, will you go if I change my clothes?",
  "42977": "Oh, he mentioned his name, did he?",
  "42978": "Can you let me sit by the fire?",
  "42979": "Then how?",
  "42980": "How is it possible to hear her?",
  "42981": "How are we going to get back?",
  "42982": "Need you say it face to face?",
  "42983": "Wooster?",
  "42984": "Will he get used to it?",
  "42985": "Who may the four be?",
  "42986": "Do I look as if I liked it?",
  "42987": "Well, is it good?",
  "42988": "Then a man may feel for years that he is good solid company, and be wrong about himself after all?",
  "42989": "Are we only half way up?",
  "42990": "Pray, when, sir, shall I see you at my house?",
  "42991": "But when is this ball to take place?",
  "42992": "And my son?",
  "42993": "But will you gi'e me all the ground the goose flew over?",
  "42994": "Who denies you this right?",
  "42995": "What is the rule in such a case?",
  "42996": "How do you mean to live then?",
  "42997": "Can you guess how he will be likely to behave towards his flatterers and his supposed parents, first of all during the period when he is ignorant of the false relation, and then again when he knows?",
  "42998": "If you see us among scores of women, will you look upon us?",
  "42999": "Where does the remainder go?",
  "43000": "Did any of you see him trailing us?",
  "43001": "And was he sure of what he said?",
  "43002": "I wrote to you for some grammars, if you recollect, and you sent them?",
  "43003": "But shall we go down and watch this absorbing match?",
  "43004": "My plans?",
  "43005": "And who had deserved the worst?",
  "43006": "Do you believe in my instinctive feelings?",
  "43007": "Are you sure I can get all the things I want there?",
  "43008": "On the front?",
  "43009": "Do you not see then, sire, that this is a covert and indirect accusation against yourself, and that while he praises pardoning love, he at the same time condemns and accuses your righteous and punitory wrath?",
  "43010": "Why weary, and palsy the arm at the oar, and the iron, and the lance?",
  "43011": "Her father, eh?",
  "43012": "What difference did it make?",
  "43013": "Are my purposes wont to be so shallow?",
  "43014": "Have you had any tea, by the by?",
  "43015": "What promise?",
  "43016": "Who finds them?",
  "43017": "What are you doing there, my friend?",
  "43018": "Did you treat anybody, sir?",
  "43019": "May I?",
  "43020": "And why was I running after her?",
  "43021": "What if the acts he had reconciled himself to because they made him a stronger instrument of the divine glory, were to become the pretext of the scoffer, and a darkening of that glory?",
  "43022": "Shall history be blind to such fatality as this?",
  "43023": "Must I ever be on the way?",
  "43024": "But could you BEAR to have it swinging to your boat?",
  "43025": "Why, what's the reason, sir?",
  "43026": "What might I not get to know, nearly concerning you?",
  "43027": "What do they mean?",
  "43028": "What do they want?",
  "43029": "What is it like?",
  "43030": "And do you care?",
  "43031": "Count on my assistance?",
  "43032": "Where are they to be found?",
  "43033": "Must I always be the same?",
  "43034": "Why, pray, did you laugh at this?",
  "43035": "And were you warm?",
  "43036": "Where are we?",
  "43037": "If I told her all my fortune is lost?",
  "43038": "Who is a foolish man?",
  "43039": "What matter?",
  "43040": "Have you anything to say to me?",
  "43041": "Who are you?",

  "43043": "So you and the cardinal have been talking about me?",
  "43044": "Have we not botanical gardens?",
  "43045": "Why will you increase my distress by this groundless dispute?",
  "43046": "Is that called a funnel?",
  "43047": "Do they look like that sort of thing?",
  "43048": "How shall I ever repay you?",
  "43049": "Are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and reconciliation?",
  "43050": "Fwhat's she doin' outside?",
  "43051": "And what do you know about the state you talk of?",
  "43052": "Can any man of serious reflection hazard his future happiness upon the belief of a story naturally impossible, repugnant to every idea of decency, and related by persons already detected of falsehood?",
  "43053": "And why should I hesitate to betray that monster, sir?",
  "43054": "Nay, what is there that is not open to your very enemies?",
  "43055": "What is she to us?",
  "43056": "What are you?",
  "43057": "Am I to pay the piper?",
  "43058": "Who's up stairs, you dog?",
  "43059": "Who is this beauty and where is she to be seen, when she was not seen before till you saw her, if you did see her?",
  "43060": "Is it to do us some ill turn?",
  "43061": "What is it they're going to play?",
  "43062": "You wretch, eat up your visitors in your own house?",
  "43063": "Who's she?",
  "43064": "Where and when have you seen me trifle with a friend's heart and a king's life?",
  "43065": "Even when no one can hear us, may I, by no syllable, by none, not the slightest intimation, remind you of our love?",
  "43066": "Yes, it is a child, but who brought it here?",
  "43067": "Eh?",
  "43068": "Have you made anything out of the tangle?",
  "43069": "Am I to be left here in my old age, not a rational soul to speak to, and no other place in the village where there's a drop of decent punch to be had?",
  "43070": "What are you making such a fuss about?",
  "43071": "Well, then, whom does it concern?",
  "43072": "Do you not deduce something from that?",
  "43073": "But who could have taken it?",
  "43074": "One figure whose movements you follow with at least curiosity?",
  "43075": "One?",
  "43076": "What's to become of him?",
  "43077": "May I read it over again?",
  "43078": "How shall I ever mourn enough for all my kinsmen?",
  "43079": "Shall a man not come back to the loveliest lady in all the wide world?",
  "43080": "How long will you be with us?",
  "43081": "Does she know it?",
  "43082": "You heard of the duel?",
  "43083": "Can you show me the place as I go back?",
  "43084": "What else could I do?",
  "43085": "And do you think we have nothing to fear if we land?",
  "43086": "And are you going to make a fisherman of him?",
  "43087": "What kind of spectacle would its hidden hemisphere present to our terrestrial spheroid?",
  "43088": "Would you have doomed me, at any time, to the frost and blight that have hardened and spoiled me?",
  "43089": "A secret ambassador?",
  "43090": "Do you not constantly argue that this is not the right place to oppose it?",
  "43091": "Then you have some secret hope to buoy you up and please you with whispers of the future?",
  "43092": "But where are you hurrying now?",
  "43093": "You have the same eye to your own interest, that you always had, I doubt not?",
  "43094": "And how should you understand him?",
  "43095": "A coward?",
  "43096": "What have you done about it?",
  "43097": "What could he get by that?",
  "43098": "Do you know whom she reminds me of?",
  "43099": "The accusation?",
  "43100": "Now I ask, what idea do we form of these bodies or objects, to which we suppose solidity to belong?",
  "43101": "But am I in time?",
  "43102": "Will he not utterly hate a lie?",
  "43103": "I had the best of it this time?",
  "43104": "Can you understand the happiness I get out of my absinthe?",
  "43105": "How know you that?",
  "43106": "Now?",
  "43107": "And what kind of fool?",
  "43108": "Casaubon?",
  "43109": "Is it KETCHING?",
  "43110": "Can you wash dishes right?",
  "43111": "But do they not rather demonstrate the absence of a gang?",
  "43112": "Do you think I'm a presumptuous fool?",
  "43113": "Why need I insist further?",
  "43114": "Is he a poet?",
  "43115": "Am I alive and a reality, or am I but a dream?",
  "43116": "Indeed, sir?",
  "43117": "Then the moon was once inhabited?",
  "43118": "Nothing the matter?",
  "43119": "Are we still under the sea?",
  "43120": "But tell me, how does he produce the appearance of death?",
  "43121": "Know you what such a moment holds for me?",
  "43122": "Now, my ladies, you strike him not?",
  "43123": "Is that the idea?",
  "43124": "Will that be necessary?",
  "43125": "You're proud of them?",
  "43126": "Why should an exception be made in her favor?",
  "43127": "Gone where?",
  "43128": "What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman?",
  "43129": "Did ever any one see such a fine piece of beef so completely ruined?",
  "43130": "Yea, is it so bad as that?",
  "43131": "Who does me this?",
  "43132": "And people think it so?",
  "43133": "What have I done that you should pass on me so severe a sentence?",
  "43134": "Did the gentleman give a name?",
  "43135": "Were they then so soon to lose him whom they had snatched from an agonizing death?",
  "43136": "And what shall you do?",
  "43137": "But why so?",
  "43138": "He was disposed to interfere too much, was he?",
  "43139": "Hot and moist?",
  "43140": "Any guerrillas?",
  "43141": "Is he goodly enough?",
  "43142": "And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?",
  "43143": "He is a rebel, then?",
  "43144": "Did you ever meet with anything like that man out of this blessed country?",
  "43145": "What were we who had strayed in here?",
  "43146": "Have I not sworn to you that I loved you in return?",
  "43147": "How have you passed the time?",
  "43148": "Had it struck on a submerged rock, or on an enormous wreck?",
  "43149": "But what if it all had been lost?",
  "43150": "Why had that man taken to flight on the arrival of the police, instead of entering a complaint?",
  "43151": "But the light?",
  "43152": "And what happens?",
  "43153": "Kindly?",
  "43154": "But what step would you propose to me?",
  "43155": "Why should you want to spite her?",
  "43156": "Can men refuse to be pleased with words of gentle advice?",
  "43157": "And just actions cause justice, and unjust actions cause injustice?",
  "43158": "Shall he live?",
  "43159": "Do you think he can last till morning?",
  "43160": "What, if I am steeped in poverty?",
  "43161": "An advice?",
  "43162": "No one?",
  "43163": "Is it in this mode that the spirit of mutual support and common effort for the common good, is to be cultivated?",
  "43164": "You will not do that?",
  "43165": "Did you say?",
  "43166": "Oh, what are you doing?",
  "43167": "Where is the corpse lying?",
  "43168": "Is not this so?",
  "43169": "How many of their friends must have fallen in the struggle?",
  "43170": "Do you see this woman sitting beside me?",
  "43171": "And when you see the same evils in the tyrannical man, what do you say of him?",
  "43172": "Are, however, pleasures and pains strictly commensurable?",
  "43173": "Do you hear me?",
  "43174": "My dear fellow, are you really on such good terms with her as to venture to take me to her box?",
  "43175": "How may I aid in the adventure?",

  "43183": "A horse for your lackey?",
  "43184": "How could one fail to understand?",
  "43185": "How's that?",
  "43186": "How long has he been going on thus?",
  "43187": "And that human virtue is justice?",
  "43188": "Who is on duty?",
  "43189": "Did not I say so?",
  "43190": "Do fine work?",
  "43191": "But why did we teach you that?",
  "43192": "Why did they do it?",
  "43193": "Anybody been beating 'ee?",

  "43197": "What doom was his own father's?",
  "43198": "Who shall it be if not he who does this work well?",
  "43199": "How many bedrooms?",
  "43200": "Well, you see the hills beyond?",
  "43201": "And can it be my fault, can I have done anything wrong?",
  "43202": "And what if we came too late?",
  "43203": "You have turned full steam on?",
  "43204": "Have you heard?",
  "43205": "Have the humanistic studies not given to him, as to so many of his contemporaries, a distinctive mental bent?",
  "43206": "What interest, let me ask, have the people in the settlement of this question?",
  "43207": "And how should I, having been a hunter all my life?",
  "43208": "Why, what's the matter with you?",
  "43209": "And why, if you knew me, do you let me die?",
  "43210": "But what is to be done?",
  "43211": "You do not doubt that, I hope?",
  "43212": "Is it interesting?",
  "43213": "Eureka?",
  "43214": "What do they call it, that which maketh them proud?",
  "43215": "Why do you think so?",
  "43216": "What is it, dear one?",
  "43217": "Could I retract my word, and take upon myself the responsibility of compromising the future of my companions?",
  "43218": "And is it any better as it is?",
  "43219": "Answer, what?",
  "43220": "But is there no danger from the bite?",
  "43221": "How could I remember you?",
  "43222": "But do you understand me?",
  "43223": "What are we going to do, i'faith?",
  "43224": "Shall I obtain permission not to do so till I have spoken to the king, sire?",

  "43398": "Was he not beloved, held dear, well seen of all men?",
  "43399": "And hard up, I suppose?",
  "43400": "But do you see, he rejoined, how many we are?",
  "43401": "Must I have a candle?",
  "43402": "Pray, why is it that people say that men are not such sots nowadays as they were in the days of yore?",
  "43403": "Would you draw and inveigle from me my clients and customers?",

  "43433": "Was it hate?",
  "43434": "Do these changes mean that we should alter our traditional approach to the doctrine for and design of forces?",
  "43435": "Where, there?",
  "43436": "What mean you by that?",
  "43437": "When I am better, do you mind?",
  "43438": "Madame?",
  "43439": "Is that holy awe filling you?",
  "43440": "All that would arise out of his ignorance of the true upper and middle and lower regions?",
  "43441": "Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?",
  "43442": "Why then do you speak of original occupancy?",
  "43443": "But is she safe?",
  "43444": "But does not the superiority in force afford also the best means of spreading out and finding more room, and therefore more means of subsistence and shelter?",
  "43445": "You have nothing to complain of, I hope?",
  "43446": "And I was thinking, who's that?",
  "43447": "Where am I, and why am I here?",
  "43448": "Who carrieth his ashes unto the mountain?",
  "43449": "The only question is, has it been destroyed or not?",
  "43450": "May I go and ask them, that I may have the opportunity of making my peace with you?",
  "43451": "Where shall I put her?",
  "43452": "But, you understand that that was not the child I am speaking of?",
  "43453": "Well, said he, but did you wait upon her?",
  "43454": "A sledge, sir?",
  "43455": "Why does a purely NUMERICAL or GEOMETRICAL difference in the composition and form of atoms give rise to PHYSIOLOGICAL properties so different?",
  "43456": "For whom?",
  "43457": "Because of heart failure?",
  "43458": "What, the one nearest to the path?",
  "43459": "What do the caballeros?",

  "43465": "My I speak frankly to you?",
  "43466": "Succeeds it, or no?",
  "43467": "It may well be asked how is it possible to reconcile this case with the theory of natural selection?",
  "43468": "How do you know, then?",
  "43469": "Is it not a horrible caprice?",
  "43470": "Careful of what, may I ask?",
  "43471": "How can I?",
  "43472": "Where were to be lodged all the gentry of the neighborhood, who would gather in two or three hours after the news had enlarged the circle of its report, like the increasing circumference produced by a stone thrown into a placid lake?",
  "43473": "What do you think of him?",
  "43474": "Pomotou?",
  "43475": "Does it please the venerable one to listen to me for one moment longer?",
  "43476": "Now, how many tickets will you take?",
  "43477": "Hwarof kalenges tu me?",
  "43478": "Have you nothing more to say?",
  "43479": "And if there is no change in the situation, will not the future always be a deplorable copy of the past?",
  "43480": "Why repeat their visit?",
  "43481": "Is there anything at all behind that impassive face?",
  "43482": "How, again, would he take the news of his son's good fortune?",
  "43483": "Do you mean that your wife and you wish to leave?",
  "43484": "Have we followed that road?",
  "43485": "What makes you look so flurried?",
  "43486": "If they have perceived it, why have they neglected to condemn it?",
  "43487": "But does such an event lie sufficiently within the bounds of probability to justify the belief in its occurrence on the strength of any attainable, or, indeed, imaginable, evidence?",
  "43488": "Feel yourself guilty?",
  "43489": "Have you no remembrance of the occasion?",
  "43490": "Have I not told you so, gentlemen?",
  "43491": "Will there really be a trousseau and all that?",
  "43492": "What, lady, is the cause of your alarm?",
  "43493": "Whom are you going to marry?",
  "43494": "Is that all, monseigneur?",
  "43495": "Do you guess that I have come to remind you of a promise?",

  "43501": "Do you not suspect this young man of having given bad counsel?",
  "43502": "Any one with you?",
  "43503": "What could he talk about?",
  "43504": "Which years do you mean to include?",
  "43505": "How can it fail to draw the father and mother nearer?",
  "43506": "Would it not be well to hear what I have to say?",
  "43507": "Why should they look for me?",
  "43508": "When did she die?",
  "43509": "And who thinks of using him ill?",
  "43510": "Why in the world not?",
  "43511": "Has he asked for me?",
  "43512": "Then may I go and tell him, sir?",
  "43513": "Why pine not I, and die in this distress?",
  "43514": "Shall I take you in my arms?",
  "43515": "Mussels too?",
  "43516": "How does it feel?",
  "43517": "Hudson?",
  "43518": "Are you stopping at your old quarters?",
  "43519": "But what is all this?",
  "43520": "Tom, have you got on the track of that money again?",
  "43521": "Of what was he guilty?",
  "43522": "Am I still bound to her?",
  "43523": "You have not an umbrella that I can use as a stick?",
  "43524": "You were asking, then?",
  "43525": "Is this the time to sing?",
  "43526": "And who will do it for me?",
  "43527": "Is it to the judge or to the husband?",
  "43528": "Staunton?",
  "43529": "Saw it?",
  "43530": "How have I flown to the height where no rabble any longer sit at the wells?",
  "43531": "Why do you do that?",
  "43532": "Burned?",
  "43533": "Has the host told you nothing, then?",
  "43534": "How could I have mistook you?",
  "43535": "Does she, indeed?",
  "43536": "What are his means of existence?",
  "43537": "And she will hold her tongue?",
  "43538": "Would not the first of them who saw me wring my neck like a snipe's?",
  "43539": "How should I know?",
  "43540": "Was it her hairdresser who had escaped from a bear, or was it a bear who had escaped from her hairdresser's?",
  "43541": "What house?",
  "43542": "It is, eh?",
  "43543": "And then, when she heard how true he was, how he persisted against father, mother, and sisters, how could it be that that should not be a merit in her eyes which was so great a fault in theirs?",
  "43544": "Do you think we'd have let them know about it?",
  "43545": "And now, is it all over between us?",
  "43546": "And it was very natural that she should, for having so few sentiments in common, when the sexual tie was broken, what was to hold her?",
  "43547": "Have you no husband?",
  "43548": "O my dear friend, how can I enumerate the benefits that I have received from your goodness?",
  "43549": "And are enemies also to receive what we owe to them?",
  "43550": "When he is by himself he will not mind saying or doing many things which he would be ashamed of any one hearing or seeing him do?",
  "43551": "Is the nurse here?",
  "43552": "Was he not employing all his legal prerogatives, and many prerogatives which were not legal, for the purpose of forcing his subjects to conform to his creed?",
  "43553": "How was that made?",
  "43554": "Silly question?",
  "43555": "Congratulate him on what?",
  "43556": "Then where the devil is the woman?",
  "43557": "Of what use would such sacrifice be?",
  "43558": "What is the matter with you, my angel?",
  "43559": "Who told you of him?",
  "43560": "What, under such circumstances, could have been expected even from a man gifted with great talents?",
  "43561": "I was willin' a long time, sir?",
  "43562": "And can we deliver our friend?",
  "43563": "Could there be finer symptoms?",
  "43564": "Will you let us in?",

  "43571": "What, do you confess, then?",
  "43572": "Is that bill real?",
  "43573": "Then where is the butter jar?",
  "43574": "Do you believe me?",
  "43575": "My question is only whether the just man, while refusing to have more than another just man, would wish and claim to have more than the unjust?",
  "43576": "What can I do to save you?",
  "43577": "And what if they are?",
  "43578": "Has he recognized me?",
  "43579": "Do you hear what he says?",
  "43580": "You want to go to your uncle?",
  "43581": "Do you begin, a little, to be satisfied?",

  "43598": "But, in admitting that the sun does not go out, might it not happen that the earth might move away from it?",
  "43599": "Do you mean where have I been while supper was getting ready?",
  "43600": "So, you will go?",
  "43601": "What's that writing about, eh?",
  "43602": "What chance brings you here, gentlemen?",
  "43603": "And, when so weighed, were they ever to kick the beam like feathers?",
  "43604": "What would he with vs?",
  "43605": "Would they soon be coming?",

  "43608": "How will he live?",
  "43609": "Have you weaned her yet?",
  "43610": "Is there still no end to the bloodshed?",
  "43611": "Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up to the grand northern lights?",

  "44421": "What does that mean?",
  "44422": "What do you say to a little thing in the pendant line?",
  "44423": "I should just like to know the reason why?",

  "44451": "How is one to do in order to get it justly divided?",
  "44452": "Can you steer?",
  "44453": "For how is it possible a young man as he is, should treat the wife of his opponent with so much distinction, were it not from some motive that does me disgrace?",
  "44454": "And you stick to the old shop?",
  "44455": "And would a late poet, in a society no longer feudal, know how to wind it up?",

  "44460": "How do you display your supernatural powers?",
  "44461": "Now, my friends, why do I say he is devoid of these possessions?",
  "44462": "Why is it so difficult, my dear?",
  "44463": "Why is this?",
  "44464": "And who told you about it?",
  "44465": "Is there some monster beneath us belonging to the extinct races, more voracious than the shark, more fearful in vastness than the whale?",
  "44466": "Well, what made you make that brutal and belching noise?",
  "44467": "You are looking for a situation, miss?",
  "44468": "I here ask what weight will be needed to counterpoise and resist the tendency of each of these arches to give way?",
  "44469": "Last year you mean, when I was fresh from that horrid vulgar school?",
  "44470": "Had you no fear of being kicked downstairs, sir?",
  "44471": "They?",
  "44472": "Does any one live, who knows what a steady memory you have, half as well as I do?",

  "44493": "And these days, how did they pass for you?",
  "44494": "Does he mean to ignore the proposition so long and well established in law, that what you cannot do directly, you cannot do indirectly?",
  "44495": "What need to particularize?",
  "44496": "Sith we have no boatmen here at hand, how shall we come over?",
  "44497": "Why did you give it him?",

  "44505": "You'll go back with me?",
  "44506": "Where are all the folks going?",
  "44507": "What had he to offer her?",
  "44508": "That is your best friend, of whom you speak?",
  "44509": "And can you use that tool in my presence?",
  "44510": "What have I done to you?",
  "44511": "What has been the result?",
  "44512": "You're not?",
  "44513": "Do you talk in your sleep?",
  "44514": "If he was alive, where was he?",
  "44515": "Was it fire?",
  "44516": "But where's the supper?",
  "44517": "Must they die in early youth?",
  "44518": "Should I dare?",
  "44519": "Will this means of locomotion allow us to visit those suns which swarm in the firmament?",

  "44522": "Will it be larger than the other?",
  "44523": "Have you got anything to cut it with?",
  "44524": "What the business is that of yours?",
  "44525": "And when do you set out?",
  "44526": "You have seen him, sir?",
  "44527": "Will you ask her if I may come?",

  "44535": "Do you often go into the country?",
  "44536": "Have you resolved to dishonor me?",
  "44537": "This negligent kind of guesswork, for what other epithet can be used to point out the random exertions of a sort of instinctive common sense, never brought to the test of reason?",
  "44538": "How do you get on?",
  "44539": "And even better, for are we not armed with ages of superior knowledge, and have we not the means of protection, defense, and sustenance which science has given us, but of which they were totally ignorant?",
  "44540": "But having got there, what was one to do?",
  "44541": "You remember?",
  "44542": "And do you see the one who has a shield with a gate painted on it, through which a stag appears to be passing out?",

  "44565": "A little spoilt?",
  "44566": "Did you catch it?",
  "44567": "Supposing the assertion to be really true?",
  "44568": "Money?",
  "44569": "How do you make this forgery when every piece of the evidence is genuine?",
  "44570": "Will you show me the way, for I do not know the street?",
  "44571": "How is enjoyment in this to be explained?",
  "44572": "You will arrest me, then?",
  "44573": "I see that you require someone to answer for me?",
  "44574": "What must be done for it?",

  "44581": "Is your sister ill?",
  "44582": "Is there anything that would prevent me from making a good husband to a woman that I loved?",
  "44583": "Are you sure you was nursed up by your own mother?",
  "44584": "What is to be said?",
  "44585": "With the badness of men?",
  "44586": "Why is it you and not he?",

  "44597": "No dowry?",
  "44598": "Who can discern those planets that are oft combust, and those stars of brightest magnitude that rise and set with the sun, until the opposite motion of their orbs bring them to such a place in the firmament, where they may be seen evening or morning?",
  "44599": "What used they to be used for?",
  "44600": "How is she?",
  "44601": "Why else should she come here with such a story?",
  "44602": "May I go up?",
  "44603": "What do you know respecting it?",
  "44604": "And supposing it did, what would it matter, since I do not believe in it, and know that it is nothing?",
  "44605": "Not quite intolerable in what?",
  "44606": "Then what did you stay for?",
  "44607": "Does she receive them?",
  "44608": "Might not the balloon before that be emptied of all the fluid it yet retained?",
  "44609": "But did she tell you who it vas?",

  "44614": "Do you hear?",
  "44615": "Surely you believe this?",
  "44616": "And about me?",
  "44617": "What the devil do you mean, sir?",
  "44618": "What's there to stare at?",
  "44619": "And do you feel sure of succeeding?",
  "44620": "You never heard of anything of that sort?",

  "44622": "What shall we gain by it?",
  "44623": "I wonder if water is liable to spoil pumpkins?",
  "44624": "You noticed nothing?",

  "44632": "And well improved opportunity?",
  "44633": "At what result did you arrive?",
  "44634": "But who would lend to a government that prefaced its overtures for borrowing by an act which demonstrated that no reliance could be placed on the steadiness of its measures for paying?",
  "44635": "What do you mean by bringing such a creature as that here, sir?",
  "44636": "Who can that be?",
  "44637": "And how did they arrest you, dear lad?",
  "44638": "What in the world can she do against us?",
  "44639": "O good sir, said I, may I be heard one thing?",
  "44640": "Did you get hurt?",
  "44641": "Well, you never can tell what sort of people you're living next to in this town, can you?",
  "44642": "What is life but a scarring?",

  "44656": "Do you think he died a natural death?",
  "44657": "Is it she?",
  "44658": "Will not a tiny speck very close to our vision blot out the glory of the world, and leave only a margin by which we see the blot?",
  "44659": "Are you tempting me to box your ears for you, or what?",
  "44660": "Are you all ready?",
  "44661": "Which means, I suppose, that you are not quite clear about your case?",
  "44662": "Is that carried?",
  "44663": "He asked me what I would have for dinner?",
  "44664": "Is the under side of civilization any less important than the upper side merely because it is deeper and more sombre?",
  "44665": "Should we cut the deficit more?",
  "44666": "Is it not a good place?",
  "44667": "In what way could it possibly be the interest of the inhabitants of that dwelling to serve me?",
  "44668": "Now?",
  "44669": "Was it either of these two who came for her?",

  "44672": "Therefore he has a right, for a change, to kick up his heels?",
  "44673": "Why had the archdeacon been careful of his money, adding house to house and field to field?",
  "44674": "Is it not enough?",
  "44675": "Exile?",
  "44676": "How can I get it?",
  "44677": "Are you ready?",
  "44678": "How can I stop with her, you mean?",
  "44679": "And what about the depot?",
  "44680": "What about this curtain?",
  "44681": "Would they hail it?",
  "44682": "And what would you be taking their feet off for?",
  "44683": "You follow me, do you not?",
  "44684": "What shall I pay you for this knowledge?",
  "44685": "My dear child, why will you not be reasonable in this matter?",
  "44686": "How could you give me life, and take from me all the inappreciable things that raise it from the state of conscious death?",
  "44687": "Who pitched that 'ere at me?",
  "44688": "Do they obey these injunctions?",
  "44689": "How did you know I wanted to?",
  "44690": "Can you tell me aught of him?",
  "44691": "And where have you come to?",

  "44707": "Now, I want to know?",
  "44708": "Now, what are those germs like?",
  "44709": "Nor the man to allow his junior to be walked over either?",
  "44710": "But what, then, is usury?",
  "44711": "Will you believe me when I say it's the delight of my life to have dabbled in poetry, when I think I've exercised my pen upon this charming theme?",
  "44712": "Do you understand that?",
  "44713": "Why should I?",

  "44747": "What matter of importance have you to bring before us?",
  "44748": "You are not boasting?",
  "44749": "And where is your mother staying?",
  "44750": "But now, my good girl, if I do not too much add to your sweet confusion, shall it be in the first seven days, or the second of this fortnight?",
  "44751": "Are you going to poison me?",
  "44752": "Did you insist upon it?",
  "44753": "You are not afraid of me?",
  "44754": "Of course I could, why not I as well as others?",
  "44755": "Do you mean to fight a duel?",
  "44756": "Do you hide yourself, or does your son hide you?",
  "44757": "What HAS become of that boy?",

  "44781": "But whom will you marry?",
  "44782": "Where's your risk?",
  "44783": "Where are they, good mother?",
  "44784": "It's a queer business, eh?",
  "44785": "Will you have some breakfast?",
  "44786": "Were these the first blows aimed by adverse fortune at the colonists?",
  "44787": "But then came the question whether he should have acted in precisely the same way if he had not taken the money?",
  "44788": "Then, as to provisions, have we enough to last?",

  "45491": "Is this the same lemonade of which you partook?",
  "45492": "And what does he charge?",
  "45493": "But the horses?",
  "45494": "In summer?",
  "45495": "And what the devil was the matter with his head?",
  "45496": "Why do we love?",

  "46730": "But can a man get a drop of the real stuff there?",
  "46731": "Do you wish me to tell you it is well drawn?",
  "46732": "Mother, where are you?",
  "46733": "And so you're really going?",
  "46734": "That's it, is it?",
  "46735": "Can I stay after you have struck me?",
  "46736": "Are they therefore, upon that account, immoral?",
  "46737": "But where is it?",
  "46738": "When can I set out again?",
  "46739": "Why should you be like anyone?",
  "46740": "Will you bet, then?",
  "46741": "And this man, the proprietor of the house, what is his name?",
  "46742": "Why, what else is there?",
  "46743": "But how and by what can we fix and determine this point of time, unless by that which already exists?",
  "46744": "Do you mean that you are on the right track?",
  "46745": "Whose was the fault that there were in the church so many feet soiled by unmerited poverty, and so many hands soiled by undeserved wealth?",
  "46746": "O, must you be stabbed by a soldier?",
  "46747": "Serious?",
  "46748": "What is the value of socialism?",
  "46749": "I, wretch?",
  "46750": "Did I tell you?",
  "46751": "What is speculation but a species of gambling, I might have said fraud, in which address generally gains the prize?",
  "46752": "What did I tell ye?",
  "46753": "Does she mean to prove me, or can she really not forgive me?",
  "46754": "Was it in fact true that she had nothing to give?",
  "46755": "Perhaps a cup of tea?",

  "46786": "Or was he to have one more chance?",
  "46787": "Are you certain of it, sir?",
  "46788": "If not, to what cause are we to attribute the change?",
  "46789": "But about the news, your reverence?",
  "46790": "What do I think about it?",
  "46791": "Else why should they have chosen it?",
  "46792": "Was it not, then, the shout the warriors make when they wish to intimidate their enemies?",
  "46793": "But can nothing be done?",
  "46794": "Which one?",
  "46795": "Would she speak to him about it, or would she go on forever in the silence which seemed to imply that she believed him guilty?",
  "46796": "Which of us two will you take for your patito?",
  "46797": "Other things?",
  "46798": "You can bear it?",

  "46817": "With me?",
  "46818": "Might not his opportunity be close upon him if he looked carefully enough at his immediate surroundings?",
  "46819": "Is cowardice, then, an adjunct of happiness?",
  "46820": "But the heart?",
  "46821": "Why did I try to recall you?",
  "46822": "And perhaps they are both impostors?",
  "46823": "Why should I complain, when we both have merely done our duty and will surely be the happier for it in the end?",
  "46824": "Can there be life here?",
  "46825": "Is justice a virtue?",
  "46826": "Do you mind staying with me, while I finish my matters here?",
  "46827": "Then in that case, my dear, why go down?",
  "46828": "How do you feel?",
  "46829": "And wherefore?",
  "46830": "Shall we descend?",
  "46831": "Who can be hunting at such a moment as this?",
  "46832": "What must I do, then?",
  "46833": "Will you not take yourself off from my house?",
  "46834": "Is that wrong?",
  "46835": "What is the relief?",
  "46836": "Why in the name of decency are sisters, female intimates, or ladies and their waiting women, to be so grossly familiar as to forget the respect which one human creature owes to another?",
  "46837": "What is it, sir, that you do not understand?",
  "46838": "Do you know that I pay my attentions to her, and have for some time?",
  "46839": "Did the letter ever reach him?",
  "46840": "And what did he say, or rather do?",
  "46841": "What had I done to you?",
  "46842": "Had he understood me or not?",
  "46843": "No, but have you?",
  "46844": "Who else is there to inform?",
  "46845": "And how do you consider that all this bears upon the general case?",
  "46846": "May I be so bold as to ask where yez are all going?",
  "46847": "What DO you think?",
  "46848": "Were you a party man?",
  "46849": "You particularly wish it?",
  "46850": "Are you sulking about something?",
  "46851": "Can there be a worse case than to desert and with letters persuading others to desert?",
  "46852": "You have often heard me speak of them, have you not, my friend?",
  "46853": "How much of you is a solemn, married man and how much a horrid slangy schoolboy?",
  "46854": "And would she indulge her own love by inveigling him she loved into a base marriage?",
  "46855": "What praise could they receive?",
  "46856": "What is evil?",
  "46857": "I never apprenticed?",
  "46858": "And have you not been always distinguished by me, above a common servant?",

  "46861": "Until now what good had he had of his life?",
  "46862": "Yet could it be so?",
  "46863": "And what can they want with me?",
  "46864": "Your name?",
  "46865": "Why had fate snatched his mother from him just now, why did it deny him the happiness of seeing his parents united?",
  "46866": "You're pining for pure love, are you not?",
  "46867": "And our wives and children?",
  "46868": "Would you like to know how matters have progressed?",
  "46869": "And if a son might ask, what is the name of my father?",

  "46875": "How came you to think of resting there?",
  "46876": "And wherefore do you not say, like the rest, your will?",
  "46877": "What was she afraid of?",
  "46878": "What booteth it, if I now should hate the knight?",
  "46879": "Therefore do you guess now?",
  "46880": "And if I had, do you think I would take such methods as these to effect it?",
  "46881": "Did you indeed think I believed you were married?",
  "46882": "Has some accident happened to you?",
  "46883": "Do you wish me to read it out?",
  "46884": "Why, then?",
  "46885": "You ceased to love her?",
  "46886": "What is invasion?",
  "46887": "What have we here?",
  "46888": "Perhaps he still hesitated?",
  "46889": "Have you done with the clock trade?",
  "46890": "You mind what I say, do you?",
  "46891": "What have we to do with the putting away of others?",
  "46892": "But, sire, how could you know?",
  "46893": "Have you time to spare?",
  "46894": "Why come to life again?",
  "46895": "Would the oath have been binding in favor of the widow?",
  "46896": "But surely, then, like other fossil wood, it must be as hard as stone, and cannot float?",

  "46902": "What'd it look like?",
  "46903": "And all for what?",
  "46904": "Could I have materials for a whisky and soda to hand?",
  "46905": "Is this the reward of an attachment like mine?",

  "46912": "Will you not come and drag him out of my hands?",
  "46913": "How dare you tell me so?",
  "46914": "And what did you decide?",
  "46915": "And how can such a notion of the soul as this agree with the other?",
  "46916": "On this doctrine of the extermination of an infinitude of connecting links, between the living and extinct inhabitants of the world, and at each successive period between the extinct and still older species, why is not every geological formation charged with such links?",

  "46931": "Is she congratulating you about our marriage?",
  "46932": "It that so odd?",
  "46933": "WHAT CAN I KNOW?",
  "46934": "But what could these circumstances be to which her uncle had alluded?",
  "46935": "Why need I speak of my father's time, when it is equally yours?",
  "46936": "Too late?",
  "46937": "Will you go away from me?",
  "46938": "How could he have got into such a mess?",
  "46939": "And our arms?",
  "46940": "That's simple enough, what?",
  "46941": "Hall, did you say?",
  "46942": "Monseigneur, there are so many little heaps of poor grass?",
  "46943": "Why should that cause the masses to riot?",
  "46944": "And how should I know?",
  "46945": "Is this life?",
  "46946": "Shall I have these crowns?",
  "46947": "Susan, my dear, what can I say to him?",
  "46948": "Then, you can let me have some money, can you not?",
  "46949": "You took me by force, as I suppose you know?",
  "46950": "Who?",
  "46951": "Madam, my mission?",
  "46952": "But why not now?",
  "46953": "You've heard of him, I suppose?",
  "46954": "Now speak, what's the matter?",

  "46956": "Can you give me his name and address?",
  "46957": "When duck you?",
  "46958": "Is there any answer?",
  "46959": "Athos?",
  "46960": "But what is it all about?",
  "46961": "I suppose you're converted, eh?",
  "46962": "Then you are not afraid of death?",
  "46963": "What's the knot for?",
  "46964": "Valentine, will you permit me to make a confidant of a friend and reveal to him the love I bear you?",
  "46965": "When what?",
  "46966": "But might be?",
  "46967": "Beast?",
  "46968": "What's the reward you would ask?",
  "46969": "That the present cannot be cut wholly loose from it is manifest, but how far should its dependence be accepted?",

  "46999": "Better than that?",
  "47000": "Too bad?",
  "47001": "What were their hours?",
  "47002": "And his plighted word?",

  "47013": "Buried how long?",
  "47014": "What is an imagination for if not to enable you to peep at life through other people's eyes?",
  "47015": "Well, what is that to me?",
  "47016": "Of no force?",
  "47017": "What else was to be expected?",
  "47018": "Hark, what was that?",
  "47019": "Your maid, I suppose?",
  "47020": "Would you do an old man that good turn, sir?",
  "47021": "And who was asked to the wedding?",
  "47022": "What had been her life?",
  "47023": "But excuse me, who are you?",
  "47024": "What did you do with them?",
  "47025": "Have you a patron?",

  "47032": "And what conclusions did the coroner come to?",
  "47033": "What, be driven out of our own house by a practical joker?",
  "47034": "It is a pity, but what's to be done?",
  "47035": "What is it, O king?",
  "47036": "So you'll come immediately?",
  "47037": "What was it I had stumbled over?",
  "47038": "But he is betrothed to your daughter, I believe?",
  "47039": "Certain of the fact, I asked myself was it possible that there was no communication between the two seas?",
  "47040": "Well, ma'am?",
  "47041": "But if I am not hungry?",
  "47042": "Is there anything we can do to make you feel comfortable again?",
  "47043": "You want to get hold of her?",
  "47044": "No harm?",
  "47045": "Are we not, then, to respect ANYONE or ANYTHING?",
  "47046": "Did you never hear her?",
  "47047": "Ah, I believe noblemen marry amongst themselves, do they not?",
  "47048": "But that's not the north?",
  "47049": "And if it is not?",
  "47050": "Not even one who is so near to you?",
  "47051": "Is that all?",
  "47052": "What's your lading?",
  "47053": "D'Artagnan?",
  "47054": "For what I have made the money for if not for that?",

  "47064": "What then would those do after these were dead?",
  "47065": "What course do you recommend?",
  "47066": "Is self the same with substance?",
  "47067": "If it were not that he fears you, what do you suppose our chances would be?",
  "47068": "Would not even you, sir, do the same, in my place?",
  "47069": "Want to have some fun?",
  "47070": "You are sure of it?",
  "47071": "And do you like her?",
  "47072": "Why should I?",
  "47073": "What did he think of all this time, then?",
  "47074": "Are you a beast of the field?",

  "47085": "And why this powerful organisation?",
  "47086": "When do we start?",
  "47087": "You've kindly come to look us up, eh?",
  "47088": "What's a fess?",
  "47089": "A conflagration can create an aurora, no doubt, but why not await the dawn?",
  "47090": "Has she no other companion or advisor?",
  "47091": "But the work, I suppose, is different?",
  "47092": "What's the matter with the boy?",
  "47093": "Now, was I not at liberty to show my interest in this man?",
  "47094": "Admitting this to be true of desire generally, let us suppose a particular class of desires, and out of these we will select hunger and thirst, as they are termed, which are the most obvious of them?",
  "47095": "Do you believe it yourself?",
  "47096": "May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?",
  "47097": "What baby?",
  "47098": "Do you know what I should like to do to that old horror?",
  "47099": "How do we get on?",
  "47100": "Do you think he is?",
  "47101": "In fact, what is the use of having a handsome face and a delicious costume if one does not display them?",

  "47108": "In whom can I trust?",
  "47109": "Is he less active and regular in his business than his neighbours?",
  "47110": "Now, what business has a poor widow in such a house as this, ma'am?",
  "47111": "Will you not try to sleep?",
  "47112": "Nor to any one?",
  "47113": "Any more?",
  "47114": "But when either of the two other principles prevails, it fails in attaining its own pleasure, and compels the rest to pursue after a pleasure which is a shadow only and which is not their own?",
  "47115": "But where do you live?",
  "47116": "Recollect, my friends, even why or wherefore should you thus assail your lawful magistrate, or why desert his livery?",
  "47117": "And if it were true, what then?",
  "47118": "But what about the question of doctrine, of belief?",
  "47119": "What can one say about it?",
  "47120": "Have a biscuit?",
  "47121": "What is the young lady's age?",

  "47911": "But on what day will this ball take place?",
  "47912": "How do you correct 'em?",
  "47913": "Do you wish me to accompany you, sir?",
  "47914": "What owner?",
  "47915": "OK, all right, might as well, why not?",
  "47916": "What do you want of him?",
  "47917": "Why did he allow the boat to come there?",
  "47918": "Do you see yonder, close by our ship, two barks, three sloops, five ships, eight pinks, four yawls, and six frigates making towards us, sent by the good people of the neighbouring island to our relief?",
  "47919": "Well, is she cheerful?",
  "47920": "What was his view about the value of silence?",
  "47921": "Do you think man is like a beast, that dies and is ended?",
  "47922": "How he shaped?",
  "47923": "What will be the use of the monarch whom the accidents of inheritance, such as we know them to be, must upon an average bring us just then?",

  "47928": "Quel nom a cetter jeune demoiselle en les pantoulles jolis?",
  "47929": "Will you send her on before and walk towards your house with me?",
  "47930": "That I, who have stood in the streets, and taken my people to my heart, and talked of the holiest and greatest things with them, could ever turn back and chatter foolishly to fashionable people about nothing in a drawingroom?",
  "47931": "Ought we not, then, to adopt every measure which may be necessary to perpetuate them?",
  "47932": "Now, then, tell me, if you please, what possible result of good would follow the issuing of such a proclamation as you desire?",
  "47933": "Indeed, how could they?",
  "47934": "And who does manage the hospital?",
  "47935": "And the note?",

  "47953": "Anne, WHERE will this end?",
  "47954": "That's what you mean, I suppose?",
  "47955": "How could I forget when I had given my word?",
  "47956": "Are you surprised at this want of springs?",
  "47957": "In what cases?",
  "47958": "As for me, have I not, I ask you, made sufficient advances to him?",
  "47959": "What do you mean by saying not for us?",
  "47960": "How can you expect that he'll love his father?",
  "47961": "You love me then?",
  "47962": "Then you profess ignorance of the crime with which you are charged?",
  "47963": "Think you the honours of the dead would still abide, if the souls of the departed were altogether powerless?",
  "47964": "Do you mean grave for me?",
  "47965": "But would it act in time?",

  "47971": "By the way, would you like some supper?",
  "47972": "Oh, my eyes and limbs, what do you want?",
  "47973": "Well, my dear, how am I to know?",
  "47974": "Shall we pity him?",
  "47975": "To the last?",
  "47976": "What is the use of following the alleys?",
  "47977": "Which would get the upper hand, he or the secret?",
  "47978": "Well, then, when do you think of going?",
  "47979": "On what ground can religion or morality rest, when justice is thus set at defiance?",
  "47980": "But why, mother?",
  "47981": "May I come again?",
  "47982": "But what can be done against illuminism?",
  "47983": "What has come of all this?",
  "47984": "Of that you're sure?",
  "47985": "And now, what do you want?",
  "47986": "Draw lots, do you?",
  "47987": "My pythons and hamadryads?",
  "47988": "Do we say crooked?",

  "47990": "And how am I to keep his love?",
  "47991": "WHAT IS PROPERTY?",
  "47992": "What do you deserve to have done to you?",
  "47993": "What, what is it you want to make me feel, eh?",
  "47994": "You have advertised for an able assistant, sir?",
  "47995": "Watson, this knife is surely in your line?",
  "47996": "Pedlar, I suppose you mean?",
  "47997": "Had he feigned a regard for her which he did not feel?",
  "47998": "Ah, is it you, cousin?",
  "47999": "King and friend, wherefore are you not here?",
  "48000": "Must I leave you, then?",
  "48001": "Has it not got down as thin as the homeopathic soup that was made by boiling the shadow of a pigeon that had starved to death?",
  "48002": "How on earth did you do that?",
  "48003": "What's that youse say?",
  "48004": "This?",
  "48005": "Were they, then, so necessary?",
  "48006": "Have you left me any honour?",
  "48007": "Did you ever see so many crocodiles?",
  "48008": "Are we in a healthful political state?",
  "48009": "Have you written much?",
  "48010": "Who am I who now address you?",
  "48011": "Can you take me?",
  "48012": "HIM?",
  "48013": "Are not arrangements already made for their convenience?",
  "48014": "And what is the origin of this name?",
  "48015": "Venn?",
  "48016": "Have you ever been in love with disease and suffering, like our nurses and philanthropists?",
  "48017": "She asked you to sup with her?",
  "48018": "And is it not a palpable, unquestionable good if a peasant, or a woman with a baby, has no rest day or night and I give them rest and leisure?",
  "48019": "But how do you know he'll be there when we return?",
  "48020": "In short, was the soul returning to the body?",
  "48021": "What were the fortunes of that oldest of all old kernels?",
  "48022": "Do with you?",
  "48023": "Yes, what?",
  "48024": "Nothing to say on that, either, sir?",
  "48025": "Have I not heard her footstep on the stair ?",
  "48026": "Have you any sense at all?",
  "48027": "Will it not be pleasant to do so again?",
  "48028": "Do you understand it?",
  "48029": "An accident, I presume?",
  "48030": "Lord, who can say, monsieur?",
  "48031": "To vile reproach what answer can we make?",
  "48032": "What are they going to bring us?",
  "48033": "Will you play again?",
  "48034": "A prosperous one?",
  "48035": "How should he be strong, living as he has done?",
  "48036": "Well, what ails you?",
  "48037": "Or who standing by a large fire, feeleth not from thence a little of its heat?",

  "48040": "Muishkin?",
  "48041": "And about to become the husband of a young and lovely girl?",
  "48042": "You go out at the gate by which you brought me in?",
  "48043": "What is your name?",
  "48044": "Was there any feature of interest?",
  "48045": "A scientific interest, I suppose?",
  "48046": "You are not sure that he is dead, then?",
  "48047": "You will conduct us yourself, then, to that door?",
  "48048": "Come on, will you?",
  "48049": "When did he say this?",

  "48058": "Save you from what?",
  "48059": "Who arranged everything for you?",
  "48060": "And shall I let myself be bled as if I were a chamois among these innocent mountains?",
  "48061": "What are you really seeking?",
  "48062": "Bagley?",
  "48063": "What is it, dear?",
  "48064": "Will she forever summon in vain to her assistance the lance of light of the ideal?",
  "48065": "When did it strike you?",
  "48066": "Where are our bundles?",
  "48067": "And when would his name have been mentioned, but with the makers of potable gold and malleable glass?",
  "48068": "Had he played faro?",
  "48069": "Perhaps she might be here still, who knows?",
  "48070": "What if my dear husband's death might still be avenged?",
  "48071": "Any flour or grain?",
  "48072": "Who are you, in the first place, to ask me to take a turn with you?",
  "48073": "Does this man know your majesty personally?",
  "48074": "How was she dressed?",
  "48075": "What, not even the sun and moon?",

  "48082": "Are you, then, so easily turned from your design?",
  "48083": "Tell me, can I hope?",
  "48084": "Mother, how could you ever put such stuff into their heads?",
  "48085": "Are the fruits gray like dust or bright like blood?",
  "48086": "Oh, you mean the thing?",
  "48087": "What is there impossible in what I propose?",
  "48088": "But suppose you have made some error?",
  "48089": "Got it with you?",
  "48090": "Will you take some?",
  "48091": "By whom will Z be paid?",

  "48097": "Who brought her father to life?",
  "48098": "This, then, is the friendly service which you swore to me?",
  "48099": "I wonder what her fate will be?",
  "48100": "What doth this gold profit us?",
  "48101": "What an innocent mutton, hey?",
  "48102": "Had she not accused the queen of having meetings by night with the earl in the deserted tower?",
  "48103": "What about the money?",
  "48104": "Is there, has there ever been, any question that by the law of war, property, both of enemies and friends, may be taken when needed?",

  "48111": "Would he do her any hurt?",
  "48112": "Should not he be scalded first?",
  "48113": "Would you say that knowledge is a faculty, or in what class would you place it?",
  "48114": "What in the world are you doing here?",
  "48115": "Is that which may be so applied given to help the poor, who cannot pay for education, or does it virtually subsidise the comparatively rich, who can?",
  "48116": "Do you want me to be your best man?",
  "48117": "But know you who he was?",
  "48118": "Shall we go home, my father?",
  "48119": "Well, what does that mean?",

  "48125": "Did you venture so far?",
  "48126": "By looking like fools?",
  "48127": "What is the score?",
  "48128": "In the place of your laws of monopoly, the limits of whose circle your imagination is powerless to overstep?",

  "48140": "How could he?",
  "48141": "Who is it that I hear?",
  "48142": "What are you afraid of?",
  "48143": "Where, when, and how was it built?",
  "48144": "Why are you shuddering?",
  "48145": "And what is the next question?",
  "48146": "Wherefore so?",
  "48147": "Suppose the man says to me seven and sixpence?",
  "48148": "What made you deceive me so?",
  "48149": "Express the object or purpose of so doing?",
  "48150": "Nay, what was the thing in which we knead our flour?",
  "48151": "An dust and clay and flowers of the field?",
  "48152": "Would you be so good?",

  "48157": "Was he going to throw her down?",
  "48158": "How's a poor man to live that way?",
  "48159": "Did she place it on her head?",
  "48160": "This is clear enough, I suppose?",
  "48161": "What is that you have in your hand?",
  "48162": "Is it necessary, that the peasants should work to the very limits of their strength and never have sufficient to eat while we are living in the greatest luxury?",
  "48163": "And your companions?",
  "48164": "I am to be a soldier then?",
  "48165": "Well, why not?",
  "48166": "Do you believe he will come?",
  "48167": "And his body?",
  "48168": "How old do you think she is?",
  "48169": "But what are we to do with it?",
  "48170": "Natasha, you love me?",
  "48171": "Who recommended you to come here?",
  "48172": "Strange, is it not, that the thunder birds flap so heavily along the west at that moment and a peal of laughter sounds from the lake?",
  "48173": "Is it a secret, sir?",
  "48174": "Well, what do you want us to do?",
  "48175": "Bounds, my dear?",
  "48176": "What the hell is it to you who are my friends?",
  "48177": "What you said, is it?",
  "48178": "He wants words?",
  "48179": "There has been some new development?",
  "48180": "And now amid these things what shall I say?",
  "48181": "Can you tell what we may have to go through yet?",
  "48182": "How, then, am I going to stop him?",
  "48183": "How lost you your name, my most kind virgin?",

  "48185": "Has that infernal dog torn up those geraniums again?",
  "48186": "And our guardian is both warrior and philosopher?",
  "48187": "Well, did you grieve very much for her?",
  "48188": "Are you kidding?",
  "48189": "And what did you do meantime?",
  "48190": "What's that on the arm of the chair, a fur cloak or some beast?",
  "48191": "Now, what can you do?",
  "48192": "You will go down slow, sir, I suppose?",
  "48193": "Whuzzat you say?",

  "48210": "Why should I mind?",
  "48211": "You with a pleasant home?",
  "48212": "All alone?",
  "48213": "And have they keys of the grating?",
  "48214": "And should I always be sitting with you?",
  "48215": "If I do, will you grant me common sense, then, for the future?",
  "48216": "Why, once you are rid of them, should you pester criminals to respect an uncongenial standard of conduct?",
  "48217": "And what is it we are watching for?",
  "48218": "Cannibals?",
  "48219": "On what then are you to live?",

  "48221": "And whom are you yours from, mamma?",
  "48222": "You are wounded?",
  "48223": "Perhaps he would not see her any more?",
  "48224": "Do you complain of that?",
  "48225": "Who has told them not to capture me these twenty times over?",
  "48226": "What is the cause of this exclusion?",
  "48227": "But how came you in the bag?",
  "48228": "Let us hide him away, and who is the wiser?",
  "48229": "How acts the judge?",
  "48230": "And you'll go?",
  "48231": "Have you any ideas?",
  "48232": "You heard?",
  "48233": "What's to be the wonder now?",
  "48234": "But was he himself convinced of the accuracy of this explanation?",
  "48235": "Did you lose some of your teeth, the reason your voice sounds so funny?",
  "48236": "Hang it, what's that?",
  "48237": "How like you them, signior?",
  "48238": "What has she been saying to you?",
  "48239": "Why should he take all this trouble?",
  "48240": "Can you manage that?",
  "48241": "What payment?",
  "48242": "Till what?",
  "48243": "Or, if obtained, what can it amount to, but new disgraces, contentions and quarrels?",
  "48244": "I, sir?",
  "48245": "Is not general incivility the very essence of love?",
  "48246": "You persist, then?",
  "48247": "What is this story?",
  "48248": "So we're as we were?",
  "48249": "Do you still see as much of him as ever?",

  "48256": "Where were you, then?",
  "48257": "Is there life in the moon?",
  "48258": "How is that?",
  "48259": "What's his game in the matter?",
  "48260": "And why should the entire nation be thrown into the perilous convulsions of a revolution more truly formidable than any yet attempted on earth?",
  "48261": "But what had it to do with the crime?",
  "48262": "Well, if you did?",
  "48263": "And you said nothing?",
  "48264": "Well, are you ready?",
  "48265": "Can you get near enough to throw shells into the city?",
  "48266": "How could they then prevent the pirates from landing?",

  "49090": "But how is one to know if the light of all is alike?",
  "49091": "All alone in the wood?",
  "49092": "You saw nothing of the tall stranger?",
  "49093": "Good gracious, what are you making such a fuss about when you might just as well be giving me another kiss?",
  "49094": "Have you come to assassinate me, monsieur?",
  "49095": "How can one forbear laughing to think of it?",
  "49096": "In a throat voice?",
  "49097": "Will you please to enter the carriage?",
  "49098": "Because I am ambitious?",
  "49099": "Do you know those fellows still use poisoned arrows?",
  "49100": "You know what's brewing down there, I suppose?",
  "49101": "How, then, can we talk?",
  "49102": "So you confess it?",
  "49103": "Before me?",
  "49104": "Do I know anything about your combinings?",
  "49105": "What the devil does it matter to me?",
  "49106": "And could he be an alter ego, even if I wished it?",
  "49107": "For how long?",
  "49108": "What's he saying?",
  "49109": "Do you wish to break my heart?",
  "49110": "Has the wine been getting into your head, or do you always babble in this way?",
  "49111": "I only ask by what standard judges, called upon to decide a suit for possession, fix the interest?",
  "49112": "Whose counsel first did this mad war beget?",
  "49113": "Did she say that?",
  "49114": "Who urged you to this crime?",
  "49115": "Maybe you could take one of my bad ones, now?",
  "49116": "What is the name or title of the officer in charge of these guards?",
  "49117": "What had they to be afraid of?",
  "49118": "Was it only a pretty child after all?",
  "49119": "You are not going to take part in it?",
  "49120": "The presidente, then?",
  "49121": "Well, what is your conclusion?",
  "49122": "No, what is it?",
  "49123": "But what was this hair like?",
  "49124": "Did you hear me ask you where you have come from?",
  "49125": "Only two months since you stood here?",
  "49126": "But is the disease so ridiculous in him as it is made?",
  "49127": "Did she know what it was?",
  "49128": "What did you see?",
  "49129": "I understand you to be now consulting me professionally as to your interests?",
  "49130": "And the duke, I suppose, has the key?",
  "49131": "Do you mean that I'm a freak?",
  "49132": "But how do you look upon the fate, sir, which awaits you?",
  "49133": "But what is useful expenditure?",
  "49134": "And that her grandmother's cat may now have no one to polish its teeth?",
  "49135": "Will they let it stop at that?",
  "49136": "What have I betrayed?",
  "49137": "What is he good for?",
  "49138": "You wish it to be kept secret?",
  "49139": "Was not this other lady a pleasant person?",
  "49140": "That I love someone else?",
  "49141": "How old would the son be?",
  "49142": "What's happened to you?",
  "49143": "How will it now go henceforth?",
  "49144": "Will you not set him free?",
  "49145": "What good are they?",
  "49146": "D'Arnot?",
  "49147": "And both flourish?",
  "49148": "Would you stick a knife into me if you had the chance?",
  "49149": "May I go now?",
  "49150": "Why did I rush upon my fate?",
  "49151": "But in what position are we going to attack him?",
  "49152": "Is he safe?",
  "49153": "What were these villains after but money?",
  "49154": "And pretty?",
  "49155": "How came you here at all?",
  "49156": "Still in the wine trade?",
  "49157": "What is the good of reading, what is the good of learning anything, for just six months?",
  "49158": "What has become of her, then?",
  "49159": "And you say you can penetrate it?",
  "49160": "If he wants it, where is his nobility?",
  "49161": "And you understand heraldry?",
  "49162": "Where are grace, beauty, and blandishments, like those?",
  "49163": "Wellington?",
  "49164": "You asked, what has driven me to flight at last?",
  "49165": "Did you get blown up?",
  "49166": "Is it against you or against myself?",
  "49167": "When will it take place?",
  "49168": "Will you permit me to be absent for three days?",
  "49169": "What's it all about?",
  "49170": "Surely these tombstones are not all wrong?",
  "49171": "May you tell me whither?",
  "49172": "Oh, is this the boy?",
  "49173": "Ow'm I to know that?",
  "49174": "How many did we crush under the wall?",
  "49175": "When have you ever spoken like that before?",
  "49176": "But you said I might go, father?",
  "49177": "Now what you going to do?",
  "49178": "Would he not come next morning, if he could?",
  "49179": "What does that say?",
  "49180": "How goes it?",
  "49181": "And the florid face?",
  "49182": "And you will not compromise yourself?",
  "49183": "Why it that?",
  "49184": "Ought they to smoke like that?",
  "49185": "Matter?",
  "49186": "Had she seen him again?",
  "49187": "What ails him?",
  "49188": "How did my soul rise again out of those sepulchres?",
  "49189": "And what have you been doing since yesterday?",
  "49190": "Should we go on?",
  "49191": "Did you imply that he has children of his own, sir?",
  "49192": "Do you by chance happen to think of establishing a telegraph?",
  "49193": "What right have we to make these charges?",
  "49194": "And how's this for high?",
  "49195": "How did she murder?",
  "49196": "Are we ready?",
  "49197": "Whose is this little boy?",
  "49198": "You engaged all these men yourself?",
  "49199": "But your honor will look at the baby?",
  "49200": "And if the husband is kind and straightforward, why should not love last?",
  "49201": "Charge?",
  "49202": "Well, then, these tracks upon the grass, were they coming or going?",
  "49203": "Through this window?",
  "49204": "What iss happened?",
  "49205": "Have I done anything to vex you, grandmother?",
  "49206": "And you only married him on that account?",
  "49207": "All set?",
  "49208": "Do you swear that to me?",
  "49209": "Should the aim of punishment be the reformation of the criminal?",
  "49210": "And will these save our lives?",
  "49211": "Is that question in the interests of science too?",
  "49212": "Eh, my pretty?",
  "49213": "Is not this true?",
  "49214": "But what has happened?",
  "49215": "What at our hands demand ye?",
  "49216": "What could either do, that I cannot?",
  "49217": "What therefore do you pretend to?",
  "49218": "But those who brought you up?",
  "49219": "Then it must be an ellipse?",
  "49220": "Have we taken alive an inhabitant of the seas of primitive ages?",
  "49221": "Then, why not come away with me?",
  "49222": "Where did he live?",
  "49223": "Or is this pretty artifice contrived, to signify that here the chase must end, and my pursuit be crowned, for you can fly no further?",
  "49224": "Why has so violent a movement been followed by so long a repose?",
  "49225": "A lover?",
  "49226": "Has he not also another object, which is that they may be impoverished by payment of taxes, and thus compelled to devote themselves to their daily wants and therefore less likely to conspire against him?",
  "49227": "What's wrang?",
  "49228": "Can they have finished ploughing?",
  "49229": "Is there any one forgotten thing afore we parts?",
  "49230": "But surely one can do that sometimes?",
  "49231": "Sylvestre?",
  "49232": "And why should your majesty suspect me of dissimulation, I ask?",
  "49233": "Has something special happened?",
  "49234": "Why not try and please us this time?",
  "49235": "How could you behave so unfairly by your sister?",
  "49236": "Am I to believe there's anything real in what you say?",
  "49237": "That's all?",
  "49238": "Why did you suffer him to live?",
  "49239": "Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends?",
  "49240": "Speaking with this love of your own then, have you undertaken to convey to me that you believe your husband and your father's wife to be in act and in fact lovers of each other?",
  "49241": "Would you like to inhale it for a second?",
  "49242": "Is he not prorsus inutilis ad thorum?",
  "49243": "Do you mean that there is no such maker or creator, or that in one sense there might be a maker of all these things but in another not?",
  "49244": "Well, little girl, what is it?",
  "49245": "Do not you feel a certain vibration of the soil?",
  "49246": "What is that machine?",
  "49247": "Had he reached the point where he could no longer recognize the reef, could no longer divine the snare, no longer discern the crumbling brink of abysses?",
  "49248": "Are you quite sure?",
  "49249": "You were going to say?",
  "49250": "Where did these things take place?",
  "49251": "What did you say?",
  "49252": "And what would he say to the dragon's cousin the serjeant, if the serjeant should be brought upon the field before he was able to escape from it?",
  "49253": "How do you know where to go to?",
  "49254": "To you and myself?",
  "49255": "Now what does this mean?",
  "49256": "What does it matter to you now, in any case?",
  "49257": "Our father?",
  "49258": "Children, who'd like to race the horses with me?",
  "49259": "Never mind, never mind, what does it matter?",
  "49260": "What o'clock was this?",
  "49261": "And would you just throw in a nod when I seem to ask you for it?",
  "49262": "What was he to say?",
  "49263": "And what is your success?",
  "49264": "That's a most puzzling expression for a natural science man, do you understand?",
  "49265": "Was he not made?",
  "49266": "Would an exchange of name be an exchange of rights?",
  "49267": "And have we, any on us, yet come so low as he come?",
  "49268": "At the same place?",
  "49269": "Have you no longer any kind feeling for your father?",
  "49270": "Out, even to me?",
  "49271": "Do you know?",
  "49272": "The tide?",
  "49273": "Did you receive my little note the day before yesterday?",
  "49274": "What sort of a report would they bring of the result?",
  "49275": "And what are you jawing for like that?",
  "49276": "What did you see?",
  "49277": "Going to see the pictures?",
  "49278": "But who should be the executioner?",
  "49279": "And what was that working?",
  "49280": "What are you going to do about him?",
  "49281": "You are not worse, are you?",
  "49282": "Why not go right down now and fix him?",
  "49283": "You may have recognized the fumes?",
  "49284": "Oh, what does that matter?",
  "49285": "From whom did you get this?",
  "49286": "Who do you reckon 't is?",
  "49287": "Why did he not break it there, since it is evident that every yard that he carried it increased the risk of someone meeting him?",
  "49288": "Which I took hold of and was merrily asking him what he would take to have it said for my honour that it was of my getting?",
  "49289": "How did it come to be cut like that?",
  "49290": "On the hypothesis of the essential goodness of man, how then is to be explained the monstrous attempt to change the authority of some into nobility and the obedience of others into plebeianism?",
  "49291": "Why do you trample upon dead bodies in this temple?",
  "49292": "And how did it happen?",
  "49293": "What do you consider to be the greatest blessing which you have reaped from your wealth?",
  "49294": "Where got she the strength to resist the impulse?",
  "49295": "Anything I like?",
  "49296": "Micawber?",
  "49297": "Are you a large party?",
  "49298": "What were our feelings at that moment?",
  "49299": "Where are you running to?",
  "49300": "A document?",
  "49301": "Do you not reckon me?",
  "49302": "MATERIALS?",
  "49303": "Will any antiquarian inform us, if possible, why these bones were placed here?",
  "49304": "And what do you call these, my darling?",
  "49305": "As to you, monseigneur?",
  "49306": "And had he any right to ask her for a revelation of feelings which she had evidently intended to withhold from him?",
  "49307": "Which of the three is it?",
  "49308": "What do I say?",
  "49309": "And you heard what he said?",
  "49310": "Will you give them to me?",
  "49311": "Well, and what have you been doing?",
  "49312": "Why are there no daffodils now?",
  "49313": "Is it not a happy feeling?",
  "49314": "Why sacrifice forty?",
  "49315": "Where's that ten cents?",
  "49316": "And if he left off dreaming about you, where do you suppose you'd be?",
  "49317": "With your brother?",
  "49318": "Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy?",
  "49319": "Now, dear, what are your own?",
  "49320": "I suffer from emotion?",
  "49321": "What laws are there for us?",
  "49322": "And shall she have the head she covets?",
  "49323": "Would she go out to work again?",
  "49324": "Where did I disappear to?",
  "49325": "And you have no way to get news of them?",
  "49326": "Again the law?",
  "49327": "Aunt, will you have some beef?",
  "49328": "Saw her?",
  "49329": "Shall we get out and try to find the road?",
  "49330": "You found something compromising?",
  "49331": "Do you see this letter?",
  "49332": "The gentleman who receives us?",
  "49333": "Has my father asked you for money?",
  "49334": "Who are you, that you should question the judgment of the nations and the ages?",
  "49335": "What would they do in that case?",
  "49336": "You have not counted me out as equal to so much land, and calculated on me as a balance at your banker's?",
  "49337": "Do you know what this plant is?",
  "49338": "Was he awake, or was it but a dream?",
  "49339": "I wonder where we can go next?",
  "49340": "Are you thinking, if I'm drunk itself, I'd leave my daughter living single with a little frisky rascal is the like of you?",
  "49341": "And what awaits you if you remain faithful to your oath, and obey the commands given you?",
  "49342": "Sire, have you in the army one regiment on which you can implicitly rely?",
  "49343": "Will it take long?",
  "49344": "What's that pump stopping for?",
  "49345": "But then, why do you repulse me?",
  "49346": "Are you willing?",
  "49347": "Have I any?",
  "49348": "I wish you'd lend me half a sovereign, will you?",
  "49349": "No, really?",
  "49350": "Has he left you for another?",
  "49351": "Can we really affect the adversary's will?",
  "49352": "Shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the sea?",
  "49353": "Would you say that these, or any similar impertinences which private individuals are supposed to address to their rulers, whether in verse or prose, are well or ill spoken?",
  "49354": "Was it possible for her to forgive him?",
  "49355": "How did late continuators, familiar with the serpents, lions, bulls' heads, crabs, doves, and so forth, on the contemporary shields, keep such picturesque and attractive details out of their new rhapsodies?",
  "49356": "D'you like all that frilly, bunchy stuff at the throat?",
  "49357": "What purpose do they serve?",
  "49358": "Oh is it?",
  "49359": "Were all those dear, sorrowful, valiant, charming or tragic beings merely dreams?",
  "49360": "Is there anything of the feminine gender among them?",
  "49361": "Lodging?",
  "49362": "Not his brother?",
  "49363": "And which of them made this passage?",
  "49364": "Not more?",
  "49365": "Has he been examined by any synod or council?",
  "49366": "Have you any objection to see him in my presence?",
  "49367": "But what about them at home?",
  "49368": "What is the difference between light and the lustre which is seen on the polished surface of opaque bodies?",
  "49369": "Now, ma'am, am I a fool?",
  "49370": "You know who that is?",
  "49371": "Had she left no friends, no relations behind her?",
  "49372": "What are you doing?",
  "49373": "You'll take me as I am, with nothing?",
  "49374": "Things are all right with you then?",
  "49375": "Ought he to turn to the left or to the right?",
  "49376": "Who dares?",
  "49377": "But how did you manage it, little pa?",
  "49378": "Some what?",
  "49379": "Do you give it to me?",
  "49380": "Tell me, are you human, or are you more than human?",
  "49381": "And you have not made her speak?",
  "49382": "Took hold of you?",
  "49383": "Have you not talked long enough to drink?",
  "49384": "How can you be so cruel to me?",
  "49385": "Are you better?",
  "49386": "Who is it that you have fallen in love with, my poor fellow?",
  "49387": "Come, come, who did you think we were when you ran away from us?",
  "49388": "But what do you require of me, then?",
  "49389": "Do you like roses?",
  "49390": "Not just yet?",
  "49391": "Was there ever a loser content with the loss of the game?",
  "49392": "Going?",
  "49393": "What's the colour of their stockings?",
  "49394": "Why do you look at us like that?",
  "49395": "Does his daughter know of the relapse?",
  "49396": "Is it not a pity that people who are bright and clever should so often be exceedingly improper?",
  "49397": "What did it all mean?",
  "49398": "Would you like a little mash?",
  "49399": "And what salary do you ask?",
  "49400": "I s'pose you'll be starting off for college in a fortnight's time?",
  "49401": "But, can they be expected to inspire independent sentiments, whose conduct must be regulated by the cautious prudence that is ever on the watch for preferment?",
  "49402": "Did you see a young lad passing this way in the early morning or the fall of night?",
  "49403": "How can you say so?",
  "49404": "Could inertia of race, on such a scale, be broken up, or take new form?",
  "49405": "And how did he treat you?",
  "49406": "You, dear mamma?",
  "49407": "What line shall you take, then?",
  "49408": "Towards a new sun?",
  "49409": "May I come in, guardian?",
  "49410": "Has he finished his turn?",
  "49411": "Mahotin?",
  "49412": "Yet why did he come?",
  "49413": "Is it as bad as all that?",
  "49414": "How old are you and what's your name?",
  "49415": "Are the others coming out?",
  "49416": "Are you certain that you can afford to part with so much money, and that it is right that it should be so expended?",
  "49417": "Was that last night?",
  "49418": "Is my pa in, do you know?",
  "49419": "Is that all?",
  "49420": "Was this ever possible?",
  "49421": "Their hair?",
  "49422": "Did they leave these two industries to themselves?",
  "49423": "Do they by attaching to the soul and inhering in her at last bring her to death, and so separate her from the body ?",
  "49424": "Have you been slightly dazzled at the sudden fusion of my ingots?",
  "49425": "Perhaps you did not like it?",
  "49426": "Did he look in this way?",
  "49427": "To me?",
  "49428": "But, look here, are you a great hand with the ladies?",
  "49429": "Have you?",
  "49430": "Was he a man or only a crosseyed thief an a loafer?",
  "49431": "Is that all the story?",
  "49432": "None of it at all?",
  "49433": "And how do you find home, now you have come back to it?",
  "49434": "Do you suppose you could find any good in a child by whipping him?",
  "49435": "Is it the secret instinct of decaying nature, or the soul's impulsive throb, as immortality draws on?",
  "49436": "Who was the youth he had adopted and who bore so striking a resemblance to him?",
  "49437": "And his offence?",
  "49438": "Are you sure you are not making a mistake?",
  "49439": "You mean your papers?",
  "49440": "It is a poor conclusion, is it not?",
  "49441": "It may also be called temperate, and for the same reasons?",
  "49442": "But surely this is somewhat irrelevant?",
  "49443": "Was it very vile to be dragged back here again?",
  "49444": "Can you break an engagement off slowly?",
  "49445": "Do you wish to ruin us outright?",
  "49446": "Any how does she do?",
  "49447": "Neckett's children?",
  "49448": "Safe?",
  "49449": "My friends, why do I wish for peace?",
  "49450": "Can he speak?",
  "49451": "And why not with you?",
  "49452": "Well, do you like it?",
  "49453": "What was she to do?",
  "49454": "But can you make any sense out of them?",
  "49455": "He was not playing, then?",
  "49456": "Rosamond a sufferer, a labourer, a female apostle?",
  "49457": "Who could grant them?",
  "49458": "What were you saying about being married?",
  "49459": "Was he engaged in a struggle with some animal whose retreat he had disturbed?",
  "49460": "But certain, if execution be remiss or blindfold now, and in this particular, what will it be hereafter and in other books?",
  "49461": "Did he sign, too?",
  "49462": "You're not angry with me any more?",
  "49463": "How long will this fuse burn?",
  "49464": "Why do you hesitate?",
  "49465": "How can I ever describe the charm and picturesqueness of that summer life?",
  "49466": "May I write to you?",
  "49467": "This will be your luggage, I suppose?",
  "49468": "How could that bring you?",
  "49469": "But all our praises why should lords engross?",
  "49470": "And what then would you say?",
  "49471": "What is your opinion on the matter?",
  "49472": "Pictures are like wine, and want age, you think?",
  "49473": "Where is the entrance?",
  "49474": "The barricade?",
  "49475": "What is life at all?",
  "49476": "If you please, sir, should I have no brandy nor nothing to give the poor creetur?",
  "49477": "Is he kind to her?",
  "49478": "Who is conducting the prosecution?",
  "49479": "Is it mingled with anger or hate?",
  "49480": "What had he to do, indeed?",
  "49481": "Why, what, madam, does it signify what I think?",
  "49482": "Will it be believed that the night of so brilliant a day was for me a night of anguish and perplexity?",
  "49483": "Is not this an agreeable surprise?",
  "49484": "What can you not understand?",
  "49485": "Yes, but where?",
  "49486": "What did you burn 'em for?",
  "49487": "But you, messieurs, you whom I think it an honor to call my friends, since you have been willing to accept that title, what will become of you in the meantime?",
  "49488": "But what does that signify?",
  "49489": "Has it indeed?",
  "49490": "What do you want, sir?",
  "49491": "How did that help you?",
  "49492": "Let me hear it?",
  "49493": "But then again, what has the whale to say?",
  "49494": "What power?",
  "49495": "Surely he has some opinion?",
  "49496": "Will it be soon?",
  "49497": "Must I, then?",
  "49498": "Do you call that nourishment?",
  "49499": "What WERE these things?",
  "49500": "Polo?",
  "49501": "Does he like the moor?",
  "49502": "What, dares the villain write in such base terms?",
  "49503": "But what can I do?",
  "49504": "You are quite sure?",
  "49505": "Publish what, you unreasonable man?",
  "49506": "And where do you come from?",
  "49507": "What letter do you mean she returned unopened?",
  "49508": "Why should I not stay here?",
  "49509": "Has any modern state as yet succeeded in incorporating in its civil constitution such provisions as will ensure to all classes of its subjects any considerable share in the common good?",
  "49510": "You insist?",
  "49511": "What's the motive?",
  "49512": "Could he not hinder that, by persuading her out of her system of privation?",
  "49513": "Well, mon cher, what are you doing personally?",
  "49514": "What did he know of himself?",
  "49515": "What is the young lady's name?",
  "49516": "Shall I adventure?",
  "49517": "Is that his child?",
  "49518": "Then, sire?",
  "49519": "Object to in them?",
  "49520": "Have you any thing further?",
  "49521": "Why, what do they want with more?",
  "49522": "You would wish a notary to be sent for then?",
  "49523": "Is HE her uncle?",
  "49524": "And is it really so beautiful as they say?",
  "49525": "Do you not see?",
  "49526": "Look?",
  "49527": "Do you understand, officer?",
  "49528": "From your husband?",
  "49529": "And who are you to teach me?",
  "49530": "You went home?",
  "49531": "Is not that stonework?",
  "49532": "You order me to receive his friends, too, I suppose?",
  "49533": "Have you any?",
  "49534": "Why should I stay here alone?",
  "49535": "Is my lord pleased with his escort?",
  "49536": "Who will lead us through the land?",
  "49537": "Is it a holiday?",
  "49538": "But where did he find it?",
  "49539": "Then I am not like him, am I?",
  "49540": "Have I a friend here?",
  "49541": "On an omnibus?",
  "49542": "And for what reason?",
  "49543": "And in our opinion the guardians ought to have both these qualities?",
  "49544": "What have they done to my hair?",
  "49545": "Have you ever slept, my friend, in a grove of orange trees in flower?",
  "49546": "But for air to breathe on the road?",
  "49547": "Is not some idea expressed in the act of exhuming the bones after the flesh is decayed ?",
  "49548": "Can I wipe my face now?",
  "49549": "In a game of tennis?",
  "49550": "With what will you save it?",
  "49551": "Cousin, what's the matter?",
  "49552": "May we talk?",
  "49553": "Will you be improved?",
  "49554": "Are you rich, that you may pay for courtiers?",
  "49555": "And has not her own avarice been sufficiently punished by the ruin of her own hopes and the loss of the property by which she set so much store?",
  "49556": "Why do you not go back?",
  "49557": "But tell me all about it?",
  "49558": "And why do you mean to do such a horrible thing?",
  "49559": "What do YOU think of what the prince has just been saying?",
  "49560": "What need you fear?",
  "49561": "You say you fear nothing but death?",
  "49562": "Who would believe, that a childish fault should be productive of such melancholy consequences?",
  "49563": "And my sisters?",
  "49564": "Could the diplomat hold it?",
  "49565": "Would you, therefore, that your physician heal the bodily evil?",
  "49566": "Will you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine wanderer?",
  "49567": "Had something gone wrong with the bank?",
  "49568": "Suppose, for instance, that he should be imprisoned for two months, should he be allowed to return to his living at the expiration of that term?",
  "49569": "What was this universe?",
  "49570": "What million?",
  "49571": "Will you then, in the presence of these two friends, accept me as your future husband, and plight me your vow of truth and love?",
  "49572": "Why are we to love prejudices, merely because they are prejudices?",
  "49573": "D'you remember what you said to me the other day?",
  "49574": "And did he take it?",
  "49575": "Did you ever see a crocodile overcome?",
  "49576": "Did you see the nursing home!?",
  "49577": "My friend deceive me?",
  "49578": "Well, my dear, what is it?",
  "49579": "Would you fear to go, perhaps to your death, for this imperilled man?",
  "49580": "Must I go?",
  "49581": "Why speak, when words cannot express what one feels?",
  "49582": "Who is to prevent me?",
  "49583": "Of what was he in pursuit?",
  "49584": "Can you not recognize something undisturbed and peaceful among disturbance and trouble?",
  "49585": "And you, my lord?",
  "49586": "What was behind their competent stare?",
  "49587": "And how did this despatch reach you?",
  "49588": "But how were they to be got at?",
  "49589": "What should I speak to him for?",
  "49590": "Tabooed?",
  "49591": "Not?",
  "49592": "Nor running a chance of arrest?",
  "49593": "Who said I wanted to?",
  "49594": "Impossible?",
  "49595": "But wherefore do I awake this remembrance?",
  "49596": "But why are you going?",
  "49597": "To the left?",
  "49598": "How can it be that he should think otherwise?",
  "49599": "What drives him to it?",
  "49600": "How in the name of reason can I be asked to eat a mutton chop?",
  "49601": "Who knows whether these opacities will not become transparent?",
  "49602": "Eh, what?",
  "49603": "What on earth are you raving about?",
  "49604": "What is it but the worst and last form of intellectualism, this love of yours for passion and the animal instincts?",
  "49605": "But what do you mean?",
  "49606": "With this conviction, would he have left the head apothecary in that town?",
  "49607": "Theatres, evening parties, dinners in town?",
  "49608": "What atonement shall we offer him?",
  "49609": "Does HE suppose that people will pay him only to come and sit with them and go away again?",
  "49610": "What have you got?",
  "49611": "Are you coming up there now?",
  "49612": "Have you seen 'em lately?",
  "49613": "How should this same new wisdom be started up and established?",
  "49614": "What are you, and what may your business in this house be?",
  "49615": "Do these belong to the cardinal?",
  "49616": "So that's angel number one?",
  "49617": "Then it's all right?",
  "49618": "Who are you, my lad?",
  "49619": "Baisemeaux?",
  "49620": "What month did we meet him?",
  "49621": "How about the cross?",
  "49622": "In these circumstances what was more natural than that some should advocate a return to the classics and all that the classics enshrined?",
  "49623": "What did they call the wretched being?",
  "49624": "Did he not make speeches in the lobby to show how villainous that decision was, and how it ought to be overthrown?",
  "49625": "When do you go back again?",
  "49626": "What say they?",
  "49627": "Say summat?",
  "49628": "But what is there in common between these rude outlines of instinctive organization and the true social science?",
  "49629": "I wish to soothe him, yet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of every hope of consolation, to live?",
  "49630": "Slight, what moved you to be thus impertinent?",
  "49631": "Or from the fact that I have escaped, that I have completely fled, that I am finally free again and am standing like a child under the sky?",
  "49632": "What does he wish you to do?",
  "49633": "How shall I ever thank you?",
  "49634": "Could she be happy with this jungle waif?",
  "49635": "Had he, in lending to this stranger the aid of his key, and in making some other man than himself emerge from that portal, the pure and disinterested intention of rescuing an assassin?",
  "49636": "You must wait for what?",
  "49637": "Then she is dead?",
  "49638": "But when are you free?",
  "49639": "How could such a collection be here, where you see everything except the inside of one little cupboard and a few boxes?",
  "49640": "What's your business in this apartment?",
  "49641": "Who can calculate the depth of affection expressed in that enthusiastic SO?",
  "49642": "Their eyes?",
  "49643": "Was not that everything?",
  "49644": "Dirty?",
  "49645": "Raissa, dear, what's the matter with you?",
  "49646": "What consequence is that to me?",
  "49647": "Is she your mistress?",
  "49648": "Do you know what?",
  "49649": "How would you prevent it?",
  "49650": "But where are the body o 'em?",
  "49651": "What's up?",
  "49652": "And what shall I say to her?",
  "49653": "Why did you not tell him that when he was living?",
  "49654": "Must there not have been a custodian of the shrine?",
  "49655": "Eh?",
  "49656": "And after they have arrived at years of discretion by the care of their parents, are the inconveniencies attending their separation more certain than their foresight of these inconveniencies and their care of avoiding them by a close union and confederacy?",
  "49657": "This gentleman?",
  "49658": "Might I hope to be saved?",
  "49659": "You'll be no more jealous?",
  "49660": "Do you behold the beauty and the wisdom here?",
  "49661": "What is it that these have done?",
  "49662": "Was he a politician?",
  "49663": "Darnay?",
  "49664": "But are they the same as fire and snow?",
  "49665": "Why do you bring your prolifigate companions here?",
  "49666": "What'll sting him?",
  "49667": "Who is giving the reception?",
  "49668": "Have we ceased to be men?",
  "49669": "And did he not help you to rise to his own level, so that you, little by little, became his assistant in all his undertakings?",
  "49670": "What music?",
  "49671": "D'you mean to say that if you really believed you could move mountains you could?",
  "49672": "On what?",
  "49673": "Do you follow?",
  "49674": "How could I part with him?",
  "49675": "How do you suppose a man is to live?",
  "49676": "Were you present during the last struggle?",
  "49677": "Suppose I told you the janitor picked it up on the steps almost under the big snowball?",
  "49678": "Well, have I ever been slow in coming?",
  "49679": "Call yourself a religious woman?",
  "49680": "How can one be condescending to a lady to whom one owes a matter of forty pounds, and who is perpetually throwing out hints for the money?",
  "49681": "Hollow?",
  "49682": "If the existing system be a good one, why should it not be extended?",
  "49683": "And what now?",
  "49684": "Would it be possible for empty stomachs to resist such an invitation?",
  "49685": "Well, what can you expect?",
  "49686": "And what time of day does the lady receive?",
  "49687": "What do you want to ask me?",
  "49688": "Are you out of your senses?",
  "49689": "But will you have this?",
  "49690": "Is it not adherence to the old and tried, against a new and untried?",
  "49691": "Is that irresistible power, which for fifty years has shaken the government and agitated the people, to be stifled and subdued by pretending that it is an exceedingly simple thing, and we ought not to talk about it?",
  "49692": "From what place and people have you come?",
  "49693": "Will you step this way?",
  "49694": "Then one soul not being more or less absolutely a soul than another, is not more or less harmonized?",
  "49695": "And did you run after them?",
  "49696": "There's no doubt it was chloral?",
  "49697": "If he pulls me away when I talk to you, what will he do to your wife?",
  "49698": "But do you answer for them?",
  "49699": "Have you a pain or what's up with you?",
  "49700": "To what end doth she quaver with her lips, like a monkey in the dismembering of a lobster?",
  "49701": "Akim?",
  "49702": "How was it that a man so exact and fastidious could have made this error of a day?",
  "49703": "How could you suffer such a snare to be laid for him?",
  "49704": "Say, is it then so sad a thing to die?",
  "49705": "Would you think it?",
  "49706": "Not above a mile, I reckon?",
  "49707": "Was it falling?",
  "49708": "What have I to do with that, or what have you?",
  "49709": "Are you a real witch?",
  "49710": "Who can wonder at him or do anything but pity him?",
  "49711": "How can you talk so?",
  "49712": "May I come nearer now?",
  "49713": "What do you see so terrific in that, dear marquise?",
  "49714": "Gerald himself, who was responsible for all this industry, was he a good director?",
  "49715": "But what could you do in a case like that?",
  "49716": "You hint at something not honourable, then?",
  "49717": "You really mean to marry her?",
  "49718": "And what again is that about which we have no fear?",
  "49719": "What are you going to do to me for telling them this time?",
  "49720": "Are you sure of what you say?",
  "49721": "Shall I come and see you there?",
  "49722": "Could it be he had failed to note the loud warning?",
  "49723": "What more do they want?",
  "49724": "Anything fresh?",
  "49725": "But what could he have done?",
  "49726": "We shall have to ask, how did small round bucklers come to be unknown to late poets who saw them constantly?",
  "49727": "Is it going to be on the tariff?",
  "49728": "And now by mine?",
  "49729": "Farming?",
  "49730": "Surely I've put it plainly enough?",
  "49731": "What's the matter with you, young man?",
  "49732": "They are, perhaps, in truth, a little disposed to be smugglers, but what harm is in that?",
  "49733": "The man whom they are every day telling me to take such care of?",
  "49734": "Bought their possessions?",
  "49735": "I ask every sensible man if that is not so?",
  "49736": "And are you going there?",
  "49737": "Chemicals?",
  "49738": "What was he to do?",
  "49739": "May I, sir, said I, beg all your anger on myself, and to be reconciled to your good sister?",
  "49740": "What is the use of these trips, in the first place?",
  "49741": "Will you drink some of this ether and water?",
  "49742": "So that is true, is it?",
  "49743": "Have you anything to carry?",
  "49744": "Daae?",
  "49745": "Am I to be beaten too?",
  "49746": "Is it very long?",
  "49747": "In what way shall I have the money?",
  "49748": "Do I smell ginger?",
  "49749": "Do you hear me?",
  "49750": "And is this the return you make to me?",
  "49751": "Are you going?",
  "49752": "You do not give her up, monsieur?",
  "49753": "What did you lose?",
  "49754": "Have you a cab?",
  "49755": "Has her keeper been for her?",
  "49756": "In what way are schools going to help the people to improve their material position?",
  "49757": "Is it not almost to BELIEVE in one's own virtues?",
  "49758": "You will go down?",
  "49759": "Now, what mortal imagination could conceive it?",
  "49760": "Madame will await my return?",
  "49761": "And he has not married yet?",
  "49762": "Do you suppose I ever forgot you?",
  "49763": "Is your honor sure?",
  "49764": "Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?",
  "49765": "Are they not good seamen?",
  "49766": "Will you let me take the bundle now?",
  "49767": "Blest?",
  "49768": "What did he hope for?",
  "49769": "What shall I do with the horse, general?",
  "49770": "You have not turned saving, at this time of day, I hope?",
  "49771": "Did you really hear it yourself?",
  "49772": "Does no one cry here, either?",
  "49773": "And do you not imagine, he said, that if there were a competition in evil, the worst would be found to be very few?",
  "49774": "The main point, the point why MY wife had to be burnt rather than my neighbour's?",
  "49775": "What on earth were they to do with him?",
  "49776": "Well, dear?",
  "49777": "Is there to be no sale after all?",
  "49778": "And where the deuce did you pick him up?",
  "49779": "But the diamond I gave you yesterday?",
  "49780": "That were heretics?",
  "49781": "That does not seem a very likely start, does it?",
  "49782": "And you would have kept your word, monseigneur?",
  "49783": "But, what can I do for them, here?",
  "49784": "Mamma, from whom was that letter which you got this morning?",
  "49785": "Do not say that you look for none?",
  "49786": "A proof?",
  "49787": "Have you got that cross you bought from the soldier with you?",
  "49788": "Speak to her now?",
  "49789": "And was not its mouth like a parrot's beak?",
  "49790": "But the DUNCAN is a pleasure yacht, is it not?",
  "49791": "What do you think she used to do?",
  "49792": "Where is the ink, I wonder?",
  "49793": "Do these women think?",
  "49794": "Where is the road to the south?",
  "49795": "What do you say, sir?",
  "49796": "Will it last long?",
  "49797": "Did you ever mention to any one that it was your intention to give any one the treaty to be copied?",
  "49798": "How was all that to be told effectively to a young woman in gentle words?",
  "49799": "Is his son with him?",
  "49800": "Do you speak to me as a magistrate or as a friend?",
  "49801": "Was the fox alive, or was it dead?",
  "49802": "Must man always be wretched?",
  "49803": "Whither would you go first?",
  "49804": "Picked out by whom?",
  "49805": "You will do that?",
  "49806": "What sense could there be in letting the land to the peasants, on condition that they pay the rent to themselves?",
  "49807": "Who are all those persons?",
  "49808": "What would you do?",
  "49809": "What hurt have you got?",
  "49810": "Was ever man so beset as I?",
  "49811": "Any time, sir?",
  "49812": "This?",
  "49813": "Why should you thus harass yourself?",
  "49814": "How shall I ever again believe in human goodness?",
  "49815": "What on earth have you been up to, man?",
  "49816": "What was I doing yesterday at this hour?",
  "49817": "Is he a millionaire?",
  "49818": "Is it for us to see?",
  "49819": "And who is it she has tried to marry?",
  "49820": "She has no daughter of her own, has she?",
  "49821": "When can I reckon on receiving information from you?",
  "49822": "And the young man?",
  "49823": "You've only believed me contented then because you've believed me stupid?",
  "49824": "Whatever's that?",
  "49825": "So you're on to him, too?",
  "49826": "Did she love him?",
  "49827": "Then what am I?",
  "49828": "To what end all this?",
  "49829": "What rights?",
  "49830": "Will you go fetch him?",
  "49831": "How, indeed, can an instructor remedy this evil?",
  "49832": "What, teasing again?",
  "49833": "Why did you?",
  "49834": "Did she show courage?",
  "49835": "Not have it?",
  "49836": "Do you know of any?",
  "49837": "How can you be so unjust?",
  "49838": "Is the spring coming?",
  "49839": "But what is it all about?",
  "49840": "That you mean to marry me?",
  "49841": "How long have you held your position in that college?",
  "49842": "I wonder if he could have followed after us, and got lost?",
  "49843": "And your two other friends?",
  "49844": "Since when has malady banished medicine?",
  "49845": "What can we hope for at the hands of such as those?",
  "49846": "Sure, what is a kiss from the finest of women but a pleasant thing, like a long putt sunk, or the first salmon of the year caught like a trout, or the ball through the goal before the whistle blows?",
  "49847": "Is there no reality in the penitence thus sealed and witnessed by good works?",
  "49848": "Seditious to wish to be governed by good heads or leaders?",
  "49849": "Are her disappointment and sorrow of no interest to you?",
  "49850": "You are ready to sacrifice the world for love?",
  "49851": "And you take their view?",
  "49852": "With grief and trouble, my dear friend?",
  "49853": "Is it the simple or the compound, the unchanging or the changing, the invisible idea or the visible object of sense?",
  "49854": "And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie?",
  "49855": "What peevish luck have I, I cannot meet with these bragging rascals?",
  "49856": "What disagreeable people?",
  "49857": "You come from the provinces?",
  "49858": "What DO such men as he want?",
  "49859": "Meanwhile, I dare say you would like to arrange your toilette a little?",
  "49860": "Do I seek amusements outside our home?",
  "49861": "Both at the same time?",
  "49862": "See?",
  "49863": "You did come home, then?",
  "49864": "If you are not a doctor, what are you?",
  "49865": "Who calls it a vale of tears?",
  "49866": "What can you do in this dark, gloomy mystery?",
  "49867": "Whose work is this?",
  "49868": "Are you not well?",
  "49869": "What are you going to do?",
  "49870": "Am I?",
  "49871": "Settled?",
  "49872": "You'll be the new captain?",
  "49873": "How have you been?",
  "49874": "Is it good?",
  "49875": "Foster?",
  "49876": "And he is engaged to her now?",
  "49877": "Please, my dear fellow, will you sharpen my saber for me?",
  "49878": "Where did I leave?",
  "49879": "And these, if they are opposites, are generated the one from the other, and have there their two intermediate processes also?",
  "49880": "May I not say a word of comfort to him?",
  "49881": "What wonderful thing is that?",
  "49882": "What can have become of her, then?",
  "49883": "Why do you think so?",

  "49890": "Were you surprised, my asking you to take me out and give me a bit of dinner tonight?",
  "49891": "And are those enemies too?",
  "49892": "Am I pretty?",
  "49893": "Do you mean him harm, sir?",
  "49894": "What person?",
  "49895": "And what do you want with your flag of truce?",
  "49896": "And what do you say of him who is hated by all the people of his neighborhood?",

  "49908": "Will she come?",
  "49909": "Will that please you, dear?",
  "49910": "Out of sorts?",
  "49911": "I?",
  "49912": "Which are my fingers and which are yours?",
  "49913": "Am I not too late?",
  "49914": "But then would it not be better to do away with them entirely?",

  "49947": "Have you got any money?",
  "49948": "Like what she used to be, or like what she was in the carriage?",
  "49949": "Does it, in dealing with other nations, civilized or backward, propose what is palpably to its own advantage, or is it evidently disinterested?",
  "49950": "Why have you not sent to me?",

  "49959": "Where's your warrant?",
  "49960": "Did he give you this?",
  "49961": "What do you say of making an exchange?",

  "49966": "Burned it?",
  "49967": "You have nothing to regret?",
  "49968": "And who would not have so believed, hearing him so speak at the point of death?",
  "49969": "Why, then, have they lost in laboring for you what you have gained in not laboring for them?",
  "49970": "Do you remember?",

  "49983": "What brings you here?",
  "49984": "Will you live with us?",
  "49985": "All the same, how much might you be disposed to offer me for this beautiful young horse of mine?",
  "49986": "You have your chronometer?",
  "49987": "May I speak to your mistresses?",
  "49988": "You want me to throw again, do you not?",
  "49989": "Was it not enough?",
  "49990": "Did you hear what I asked you, or not?",
  "49991": "What is the destination marked on your ticket?",
  "49992": "You believe in the moon then, affecting the weather?",
  "49993": "And there was no one in it but the two of you alone?",
  "49994": "With all this, sir, said I, can you think I shall be at a loss to pass my time?",
  "49995": "Have you ever tried sulphate of copper in water?",
  "49996": "You do not suffer?",
  "49997": "To be ordained, I think you said?",
  "49998": "What about him?",
  "49999": "Would you think you were well off, if there were not one creature in the world near you to love you?",

  "50006": "Do you mean it's cut out of a single crystal?",
  "50007": "But would his men obey orders?",
  "50008": "In view of our moral, social, and political responsibilities, can we do this?",
  "50009": "Would a man, think you, give YOU up if you were poor?",
  "50010": "What good are we doing with all this ado?",
  "50011": "Heigh ha?",
  "50012": "Or did it come through the post?",
  "50013": "Where are your passports?",
  "50014": "Why show me this, if I am past all hope?",

  "50020": "At this rate, man, how can you ever expect to marry?",
  "50021": "And you will try and save yourself by swimming?",
  "50022": "What sort of a man is he?",

  "50042": "What do I see?",
  "50043": "Who can follow an animal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where no man would venture to intrude?",
  "50044": "You know where to deliver it?",
  "50045": "Mother, why did our grand relation keep on putting his hand up to his mistarshers?",
  "50046": "Said I in secret?",

  "50182": "What means it?",
  "50183": "Does it belong to the smaller or to the larger of the two?",

  "51078": "But what could she say or do?",
  "51079": "I hope you want nothing?",
  "51080": "And joy, the joy of the theatre, would that, too, be taken away?",
  "51081": "Why not tonight?",
  "51082": "Was he mad, then, as well as blind, that he talked to himself?",

  "51291": "Does it matter?",
  "51292": "What do you go for, then?",
  "51293": "How do you feel now, my love?",
  "51294": "What is this, then?",
  "51295": "Did you want him too to go sailing about amid all kinds of hardship while others are eating up his estate?",
  "51296": "You do like it?",
  "51297": "And now you know all that you want to know, do you not?",

  "54963": "Was it still night?",
  "54964": "Who was this almost beardless young man, who was so glacial and so generous, who knew people's names, who knew all their names, and who opened his purse to them, who bullied rascals like a judge, and who paid them like a dupe?",
  "54965": "Why came I here to cast away my life?",
  "54966": "The old gentleman over the way?",
  "54967": "Did you say, four ladies?",
  "54968": "Do you still wish to dispose of all?",
  "54969": "Does he tell lies?",

  "54978": "Must the citizen ever for a moment, or in the least degree, resign his conscience to the legislator?",
  "54979": "Do you want to cross the channel?",
  "54980": "But can this be so confidently said of sexual selection?",
  "54981": "And is there any hope of that, sir?",
  "54982": "Where are you going?",
  "54983": "You will appear at this ball?",
  "54984": "What did I come for?",
  "54985": "Whose?",
  "54986": "This is where he lives, is it?",
  "54987": "But what does all this mean?",
  "54988": "And have you a pale blue dress on?",
  "54989": "And in the course of that month?",
  "54990": "If there were one man who would carry you a medical reform and another who would oppose it, should you inquire which had the better motives or even the better brains?",
  "54991": "Who can live the same moment twice?",
  "54992": "What did he say in that one?",
  "54993": "Is it true that you received there a man who is your lover?",
  "54994": "Is any man, in these days, sensible, seeing what a racket we have to live among?",
  "54995": "Quis custodiet istos custodes?",
  "54996": "Let's sit here for a bit, shall we?",
  "54997": "How many days would it require to make two studs exactly like them?",

  "55003": "He passes along the same path at the same hour, and to whom should he be going except to the convict?",
  "55004": "And the murderer?",
  "55005": "How might it come to pass that we should all die there, through anybody's hate?",
  "55006": "What did he do there?",
  "55007": "Are you not?",
  "55008": "And the queens?",
  "55009": "What are they doing?",
  "55010": "Len, you will make it all right?",
  "55011": "The car?",
  "55012": "Was he, or was he not, the father of the young girl?",
  "55013": "He only peeps?",
  "55014": "When will you come to see me?",
  "55015": "What would you wish for, girls, if you could have a wish granted?",
  "55016": "What can I be?",
  "55017": "Why, what were you going to do?",
  "55018": "How then could you have recognized me, if you have never seen my portrait or my person?",

  "55027": "Because, if it was so long ago, how could the people about him have made that mistake of putting some of the trouble out of his head, after it was taken off, into mine?",
  "55028": "To place yourself under his protection?",
  "55029": "Why should I object?",
  "55030": "What but a future of patient labor?",
  "55031": "How is your father getting on?",
  "55032": "These walls are you going, gentlemen?",
  "55033": "Where is such a judge to be found?",
  "55034": "Why, then, is he not indemnified?",
  "55035": "Why did they do it?",
  "55036": "These were the exact words, my beloved husband, were they not?",
  "55037": "Is it for my own pleasure that I am at the farm or in the office from morning to night?",
  "55038": "He is not resident, then?",
  "55039": "Is the swallow in sight?",
  "55040": "What kind of fish?",
  "55041": "Where had she seen those lineaments before?",
  "55042": "Why must he?",
  "55043": "What has she written to me?",

  "55050": "Why should it not be known?",
  "55051": "What was the good of talking, any way?",
  "55052": "Because the higher he flies, the fewer?",
  "55053": "Think better of what?",
  "55054": "Should they end by both getting lost, and by furnishing two skeletons in a nook of that night?",
  "55055": "What is your name, my friend?",
  "55056": "Or could it be that within lay the secret to the treasure stores?",
  "55057": "Are you satisfied, gentlemen?",
  "55058": "The name of your ship?",
  "55059": "Wish to consult me on the matter?",
  "55060": "And can we tell, how long he may choose to respect those conditions?",
  "55061": "Do you press me to tell?",
  "55062": "How can I support this?",
  "55063": "How shall we live through the long winter here?",
  "55064": "You have actually seen the members of the legislature?",
  "55065": "And if he wakes up presently, where shall we be?",
  "55066": "And the best hack?",
  "55067": "Why do you not turn round and speak to me properly?",
  "55068": "What's in the bottle, boy?",

  "55080": "But what was the state of the conquerors?",
  "55081": "May I have the honor?",
  "55082": "Where is the gentle one?",
  "55083": "What is there now to warrant the condition of affairs presented by our friends over the river?",
  "55084": "Once more, how do you know?",
  "55085": "This must be a strange night to you, standing alone here with your counterpart on these street stones?",
  "55086": "But what are you talking about?",
  "55087": "Hold your tongue, will you?",
  "55088": "Who cares for me?",
  "55089": "When passed?",
  "55090": "How is it going?",
  "55091": "If, however, your wish should be one impossible to fulfill?",
  "55092": "Why do you not leave me alone?",

  "55094": "Louisa saw her when she came?",
  "55095": "Why did you look at the sunset?",
  "55096": "Why did they insist so strenuously upon this, and incorporate it into their philosophy?",
  "55097": "Shall I ring for candles, sir?",
  "55098": "Oh, why should I be made to worry?",
  "55099": "Have you found your tramp?",
  "55100": "With whom?",
  "55101": "Do you see the joke?",
  "55102": "But why this elaborate deception?",
  "55103": "Should you mind?",

  "55122": "I hope you suffer no inconvenience from the overturn, ma'am?",
  "55123": "Is not wounded vanity the mother of all tragedies?",
  "55124": "But why should it have been otherwise?",
  "55125": "Ask her, does she do this for amusement, or does she expect to earn money by it?",
  "55126": "Would that volatile mind, that inconstant heart, be likely to be fixed for a moment, even were it to gaze upon an angel?",
  "55127": "Lily, will you say that it shall be so?",
  "55128": "Pray you what do you mean, sir?",
  "55129": "Tomorrow, then?",

  "55222": "Should not a magistrate be not merely the best administrator of the law, but the most crafty expounder of the chicanery of his profession, a steel probe to search hearts, a touchstone to try the gold which in each soul is mingled with more or less of alloy?",
  "55223": "Then I must wait here, or in the neighborhood?",
  "55224": "And what is her name?",
  "55225": "What would you advise me to use in its stead, father?",

  "55260": "Is not his authority of power to give our scene approbation?",
  "55261": "What do you mean by ambitious?",
  "55262": "And if I do it for him, what do you think he's promised me?",
  "55263": "And will moralists pretend to assert, that this is the condition in which one half of the human race should be encouraged to remain with listless inactivity and stupid acquiescence?",
  "55264": "And did you not tell him to go back?",
  "55265": "I hope that I make it all plain?",
  "55266": "And is the soul seen or not seen?",
  "55267": "And was it only fancy which induced me to believe that, with the increase of my own firmness, that of my tormentor underwent a proportional diminution?",

  "55358": "And why, then, did you not refuse him?",
  "55359": "Are you my friend?",
  "55360": "But the point is, had he money?",
  "55361": "What does he say?",
  "55362": "Am I to go to him and make a deed of conveyance?",
  "55363": "What is its consistency, if it extends many million miles from the sun's surface?",
  "55364": "Have you any one to depend on for assistance?",
  "55365": "What was the meaning of that fatigue, my friend?",
  "55366": "Perhaps it was only a false alarm that troubled you, and the enemy are not advancing?",
  "55367": "But now, how do you arrange your documents?",
  "55368": "Jacob's?",
  "55369": "No one else in your room?",

  "55376": "Beauty?",
  "55377": "Are there women or are there not?",
  "55378": "Set out?",
  "55379": "Yet did I not first roughly kiss her as we danced?",
  "55380": "Well, and what may you have to say against this name?",
  "55381": "How do you like them?",
  "55382": "And he who is not on a voyage has no need of a pilot?",
  "55383": "But who will lead?",
  "55384": "But, my dear, is not this rather out of character?",
  "55385": "Or a woman?",
  "55386": "Well, if so, why do you object to my doing so?",
  "55387": "Are you the boy I've read of in the papers?",
  "55388": "Oh, what's wrong?",
  "55389": "What's the use?",
  "55390": "And if he let go his hold?",
  "55391": "In what way has it a tendency to prove that?",

  "55393": "Are you still resolved to accompany me?",
  "55394": "What does he do?",
  "55395": "Why did you keep me waiting so long?",
  "55396": "Can I say of her innocent and girlish beauty, that it faded, and was no more, when its breath falls on my cheek now, as it fell that night?",

  "55399": "My dear friend, what has happened?",
  "55400": "You had no idea of your impending good fortune, in those times?",
  "55401": "Do you think you can better yourselves, on that subject, by leaving us here under no obligation whatever to return those specimens of your movable property that come hither?",
  "55402": "Nice?",
  "55403": "May its poppet come in and talk?",
  "55404": "Yet still I have my uses, uses that vanish in monotony, and still I must ask why should we bury the talent of these bright sensations altogether?",
  "55405": "And what was it this time last year?",
  "55406": "But what is theory?",
  "55407": "Then, sir, you are satisfied?",

  "55417": "I know it, but in asking for news, I mean, have you done anything for me?",
  "55418": "What on earth have I done now?",
  "55419": "When does it become an idolum specus, the unreasonable pertinacity of a too sceptical mind?",

  "55421": "Something extraordinary must await us farther on, but, what?",
  "55422": "When shall I wake?",
  "55423": "And do you really flatter yourself that I shall yield to all your caprices, and quietly and humbly await the time of again being received into your good graces?",
  "55424": "What had he come there to do?",
  "55425": "And how stands the fact?",
  "55426": "Do you ever work, child?",
  "55427": "You hear, sir?",
  "55428": "What would you do if you were in my place?",
  "55429": "The gentleman to whom I had the honour of being introduced?",
  "55430": "Not to see the father?",
  "55431": "Will you overlook it this once and forgive me, and let things go on as before?",
  "55432": "What am I to tell him?",
  "55433": "Where do you come from?",
  "55434": "And what did you say about it, bishop?",
  "55435": "Then why are we here, my friends?",
  "55436": "Boats in the royal service?",
  "55437": "What is your religion?",
  "55438": "Must it not, indeed, be told to the whole circle of her acquaintance before she could be made to stand all right with them?",

  "55440": "All as it should be, is it not?",
  "55441": "Is that strong on him still?",
  "55442": "Do you want to go to all of them?",
  "55443": "What shall I think of this?",
  "55444": "Come, now, what do you want?",
  "55445": "Daae not see you come down from your room by the curious road which you selected?",
  "55446": "But as a man of honor should answer another, tell me fairly, shall you pay these with the same punctuality?",
  "55447": "And when doth this take place?",
  "55448": "But his stables had been searched?",
  "55449": "But, it will be asked further, can I make any use of this conception and hypothesis in my investigations into the world and nature?",
  "55450": "Of his own desire?",
  "55451": "Why should anyone pay?",
  "55452": "What do you wish of me?",
  "55453": "Pay?",
  "55454": "Home?",
  "55455": "And when?",
  "55456": "Then why should he be persecuted?",
  "55457": "Does aught lie on it?",
  "55458": "Where have you sprung up from?",
  "55459": "To what class of society does he belong?",
  "55460": "How come?",

  "55462": "And will no murmurs fill the courts above?",
  "55463": "When?",
  "55464": "Marriage?",
  "55465": "Then that is all quite settled, is it not?",
  "55466": "Or cometh it in person?",
  "55467": "What more can we do?",
  "55468": "What in the world does the man mean?",
  "55469": "What does anybody want here?",
  "55470": "Why, do you know how pretty you are, child?",
  "55471": "Will you not allow that I have as much of the spirit of prophecy in me as the swans?",
  "55472": "Shall we wait, or shall we charge?",
  "55473": "Ere I was old?",
  "55474": "What is this dim and ambiguous consciousness which, after a certain time, becomes purified, rectified, and, instead of taking itself for another, definitively apprehends itself as such?",
  "55475": "Do you know his man?",
  "55476": "Will you so?",
  "55477": "Who are the true martyrs, of those who are slain on my side, or on that of my enemies?",
  "55478": "Well, what hinders your sleeping?",
  "55479": "And you'll be my friend?",
  "55480": "May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?",
  "55481": "What do you mean to say?",
  "55482": "How about prying?",
  "55483": "Then he could not have retreated down the road, and you say that there are no side roads?",
  "55484": "Qui est ton pere?",
  "55485": "Yea, why should his father let him, if it come to that?",
  "55486": "Briefly, what did you glean?",
  "55487": "Gone, you say she is?",
  "55488": "Why does there come an hour when one emerges from this azure, and why does life go on afterwards?",
  "55489": "What has broken your heart?",
  "55490": "Do you think you will find that spring soon?",
  "55491": "How was I?",
  "55492": "And why do the children, the grandchildren, all the descendants of the first parents always return here?",
  "55493": "By whom?",
  "55494": "But then, what?",
  "55495": "Arm's length?",
  "55496": "Him as wos dead?",
  "55497": "What is its object?",
  "55498": "Are we never to educate ourselves to foresee such dangers and to prevent them before they happen?",
  "55499": "So that you may both get tipsy, is that it, and stay here gabbing all day?",
  "55500": "Why was she brought here?",
  "55501": "I, my lord?",
  "55502": "Am I really wonderful?",
  "55503": "Well, was there?",
  "55504": "What is she sentenced to?",
  "55505": "And how much for one that's all chewed up like this one?",
  "55506": "The curate?",
  "55507": "Were you alone during this conversation?",
  "55508": "Shall I have a nurse?",
  "55509": "Do you want to drown yourselves, or dash yourselves to pieces among these wheels?",
  "55510": "Was he anywhere near the big shed where we build the machines?",
  "55511": "But have we hydrogen enough to inflate a balloon?",
  "55512": "Has it a copper leg?",
  "55513": "What had she better do, or how was it expedient that she should treat him?",
  "55514": "The door key?",
  "55515": "Looked?",
  "55516": "What of that?",
  "55517": "Shall we let him in or not, if you are asleep?",
  "55518": "Repellently and stunningly clever?",
  "55519": "Where could you keep it?",
  "55520": "And that of a fluid body?",
  "55521": "Had HE his idea, and has he now, with you, anything more?",
  "55522": "Who took any?",
  "55523": "Was he true to them?",
  "55524": "Why should he not?",
  "55525": "Afraid of being heard?",
  "55526": "Will this ever take place in reality?",
  "55527": "What garden?",
  "55528": "Why should I go?",
  "55529": "On your life?",
  "55530": "No more?",
  "55531": "Is it you, sir?",
  "55532": "What did he mean by talking about favourites, then?",
  "55533": "You will wait for me, then?",
  "55534": "Was it through the chimney?",
  "55535": "But what can I do, sister?",
  "55536": "Well, are you coming?",
  "55537": "It was from your wife, we supposed?",
  "55538": "And had I wasted some of the best years of my life to obtain a shadow?",
  "55539": "Ernest was much distressed, for he liked the cook, and, of course, wanted to know what all the matter was, who it was that had just gone off in the pony carriage, and why?",
  "55540": "It is, then, the cardinal's custom to walk in his orangery?",
  "55541": "Oh how great a confidence shall there be to the dying man whom no affection to anything detaineth in the world?",
  "55542": "He paid for them, did he not?",
  "55543": "And if the world perceives that what we are saying about him is the truth, will they be angry with philosophy?",
  "55544": "Can such men fall away from reality?",
  "55545": "Are those our barks, yonder?",
  "55546": "How dare you come here?",
  "55547": "What is a magician?",
  "55548": "How can one be in doubt about what one has heard with one's own ears and seen with one's own eyes?",
  "55549": "By some happy device?",
  "55550": "Is the wind favourable?",
  "55551": "Why did you let me do such a silly thing?",
  "55552": "Have you an invite too, doctor?",
  "55553": "What happiness on earth could be greater than the possession of such a love, had the true possession been justly and honestly within her reach?",
  "55554": "Why did he wish it?",
  "55555": "And suppose she does not mind her p's and q's?",
  "55556": "What makes you say that?",
  "55557": "Excuse him?",
  "55558": "Can you get me the grammars if I promise to say it hereabout?",
  "55559": "Would he startle him with sudden fear?",
  "55560": "How would you like to come in on that with me?",
  "55561": "But are you flesh and blood?",
  "55562": "She's not in this house, for instance?",
  "55563": "What time do you get up to get breakfast?",
  "55564": "Have you not observed that the captain of your little vessel, on entering the roadstead, sent forward, in order to obtain permission to enter the port, a little boat bearing his logbook and the register of his voyagers?",
  "55565": "Well, and what do you mean to do with me?",
  "55566": "And you went asking money of him, or making talk of getting a wife would drive him from his farm?",
  "55567": "You include the grounds about the houses?",
  "55568": "What, then, remains?",
  "55569": "But are we not made better for the effort and sacrifice, and are not those we serve lifted up and blessed?",
  "55570": "What ship sail home to her haven?",
  "55571": "If a law is wrong how are we to make its immorality evident?",

  "55574": "Jane, you understand what I want of you?",
  "55575": "How did feudalism end?",
  "55576": "How about the license?",

  "55580": "For what purpose are we come here?",
  "55581": "Good faith?",
  "55582": "Confess what?",
  "55583": "Is this a time to be offering pardons, or renewing the long forgotten subjects of charters and taxation?",
  "55584": "Would you care to come and dine with me?",
  "55585": "What could she have done to you?",
  "55586": "And shall we begin at once?",
  "55587": "But would you be able for it, my boy?",
  "55588": "Surprised at this emphasis, I surveyed my valet, and, perceiving a wildness in his looks, asked if he had seen his grandfather's ghost?",
  "55589": "Get it ready, will you?",
  "55590": "But you could find out?",
  "55591": "Was she pretty?",
  "55592": "Or will he say that to abolish corruption is a bad thing?",
  "55593": "With freedom to go everywhere, with easy access everywhere, with no dread of difficulties about language, coinage, custom, or law, why should everyone continue to go to just a few special places?",
  "55594": "And why did the body conceal itself?",
  "55595": "Jo, how could you?",
  "55596": "Is not all here yours?",
  "55597": "What other possible reason could there have been for her so blushing ?",

  "55601": "And whom he brought back this morning?",
  "55602": "Any references?",
  "55603": "Was not he believed to be dead?",
  "55604": "With whom are you going to fight?",
  "55605": "And why think you that will make him sad?",
  "55606": "But when will you come and see my study?",
  "55607": "My friends, why with us?",
  "55608": "What a carriage that was, and where did it come from, eh?",
  "55609": "But is that all your evidence?",
  "55610": "Why did you give him six pistoles?",
  "55611": "You deny it?",
  "55612": "Do you feel that you are a sufficiently practical man?",
  "55613": "How do you mean sad?",
  "55614": "What crime, then, have you committed?",
  "55615": "Did I tell you?",
  "55616": "Fwhat are you talkin' of?",
  "55617": "How could she, indeed?",
  "55618": "But, surely, there is some one in the world whom you love?",
  "55619": "And where is his corpse?",
  "55620": "Well, do you know what is taking place at this moment?",
  "55621": "And would you like to be here alone with her for a month?",
  "55622": "For instance, if you lived in the penal days?",
  "55623": "I say, what on earth's the matter?",
  "55624": "She has gone to visit friends?",
  "55625": "But why did men who were interpolating bronze corslets freely introduce bronze so seldom, if at all, as the material of greaves?",

  "55629": "How could he possibly have doubted it?",
  "55630": "Who ever got a letter that was worth waiting for?",
  "55631": "What is your theory, then?",
  "55632": "You've come at last, have you?",
  "55633": "How may I tell you for what we were sunk here, when I do not know, unless it was because we were rich?",

  "55641": "How could she ever suppose such a thing?",
  "55642": "Was it the same desperate confusion, or would the ground offer better facilities?",
  "55643": "Why, but will you leave him with so slight command, and infuse no more charge upon the fellow?",
  "55644": "Sherry or 'ock, sir?",
  "55645": "You have the unspeakable effrontery to stand there and admit it?",
  "55646": "True?",

  "55649": "Does his conscience ever entertain the question of his right to such subsidies?",
  "55650": "How shall I defile them?",
  "55651": "Can you strike a man to the heart and leave no mark on him?",
  "55652": "What's your hurry?",
  "55653": "If it be, how can that question have place, concerning the subsistence of self, under a change of substance?",
  "55654": "That?",
  "55655": "And in what light must I appear to the world?",
  "55656": "Marilla, have I really a pretty nose?",
  "55657": "If I am fortunate enough to be appointed to this post, sir, for which I am so imperfectly qualified, what will become of those I leave behind?",
  "55658": "On the other hand, what do we see?",

  "55741": "Was the lady crying?",
  "55742": "What's on your mind?",
  "55743": "Where are you going to?",
  "55744": "Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land?",
  "55745": "Will you make yourself known to me?",
  "55746": "There is one strange thing, do you know it?",
  "55747": "And you've not been anywhere this evening?",
  "55748": "What had she done to have deserved all this?",
  "55749": "But what about the fighting?",
  "55750": "Is the fellow gone that brought this letter?",
  "55751": "What she?",
  "55752": "Tart of palate?",
  "55753": "And what made him drink?",
  "55754": "And what do you suppose it is?",
  "55755": "Why did you not come and speak to me in the room?",
  "55756": "Anthony, was it you?",
  "55757": "What I want to know is, where did he get that cheque?",
  "55758": "After dodging me for all these weeks and forcing me to climb the roof here like a tom cat and to come to see you as a doctor?",
  "55759": "Then to injure a friend or any one else is not the act of a just man, but of the opposite, who is the unjust?",
  "55760": "Who would say that, having come so far together, we will not go forward from here?",
  "55761": "What do you want with us?",
  "55762": "For has he not fine fences?",
  "55763": "Are they pretending?",
  "55764": "Why have I alluded to this man?",
  "55765": "Does your explanation cover every point?",
  "55766": "Have you managed it?",
  "55767": "But whither?",
  "55768": "The verses accompanying this, may I beg you to take out of the tomb, and bring them to light in the 'Home journal?",
  "55769": "By whose authority?",
  "55770": "What will you say, then?",
  "55771": "What signifies my refusing?",
  "55772": "How could I have forgotten that?",
  "55773": "But what shall we do with the poor gentleman?",
  "55774": "And you intend to make him do it in the presence of two witnesses, do you?",
  "55775": "Will your majesty allow me one word of reply?",
  "55776": "You knew the pig?",
  "55777": "At whose hand?",
  "55778": "Why do you think that you are safer in this room than on the stage?",
  "55779": "Know?",
  "55780": "Do you not know him, queen?",
  "55781": "How much?",
  "55782": "I wonder what that old man meant by his strange words?",
  "55783": "Did you see that woman who went by just now?",
  "55784": "It's not a matter of principle, but why should I go?",
  "55785": "How could I escape through these mighty walls?",
  "55786": "Are you in earnest or no?",
  "55787": "Would he ever live until then, with his strength ebbing away?",
  "55788": "Haf you got a new light for my cigar?",
  "55789": "Do you think that you could perform one more feat?",
  "55790": "What have been the results of your quarrel?",
  "55791": "How could it be?",
  "55792": "Then the superhuman and divine is absolutely incapable of falsehood?",

  "55795": "Club?",
  "55796": "Does not this stream at our feet run toward the summer, until its waters grow salt, and the current flows upward?",
  "55797": "Is that my case?",
  "55798": "And you allowed it?",
  "55799": "For his own sake?",
  "55800": "And what are those studies, if I may presume to ask?",
  "55801": "What sort of things do YOU remember best?",
  "55802": "What does that mean?",
  "55803": "And of what did he die?",
  "55804": "Why am I always to be worried?",
  "55805": "You've seen a lot of trouble, sir, eh?",
  "55806": "How did you know it?",
  "55807": "Is that it?",

  "55813": "And ought she to regard me as a friend?",
  "55814": "Where must I look?",
  "55815": "HOW'D you come?",
  "55816": "How could he get the school shopkeepers into trouble by owning that they let some of the boys go on tick with them?",
  "55817": "But how could I?",
  "55818": "What are your commands, lieutenant?",
  "55819": "Do you think he games at all?",
  "55820": "Why should I have dreaded it?",
  "55821": "After having once received the human organism, why should a soul choose to go back to the lesser and more imperfect organism of an animal?",
  "55822": "You will not go, then?",
  "55823": "Each day?",
  "55824": "But what is there to oblige him to reply?",
  "55825": "What have you two been doing now?",
  "55826": "What demon urged me to breathe that sound, which in its very recollection was wont to make ebb the purple blood in torrents from the temples to the heart?",
  "55827": "Why is it you have earth that's not sifted?",
  "55828": "Why had he suggested a dinner party?",
  "55829": "But is he near at hand?",
  "55830": "Is there a man or a voman in this valley vat does not know it?",
  "55831": "What fortune?",
  "55832": "My soule?",
  "55833": "What could they take from me?",
  "55834": "Do you feel the earth tremble?",
  "55835": "Yet indeed, what was I to him?",
  "55836": "Have you no idea of the existence of spirits superior to either man or beast?",
  "55837": "Orpheus ?",
  "55838": "Have you lost anyone, my dear fellow?",
  "55839": "Must I go afoot?",
  "55840": "Why, is it late?",
  "55841": "And what will they burn instead of coal?",
  "55842": "What do they boil with 'em?",
  "55843": "Shall we, then, regard a hearty appetite as a curse, to be mitigated but not wholly neutralized by a series of good dinners?",
  "55844": "Nay, I beseech you, gentlemen, what means this?",
  "55845": "What makes my presence here so opportune?",
  "55846": "Had he bribed the agent?",
  "55847": "Do you think that I am in earnest?",
  "55848": "A marchioness?",
  "55849": "At home?",
  "55850": "Where do you wish him to be?",
  "55851": "And that is your room up there?",
  "55852": "Where did he get his grasp upon affairs and his knowledge of men?",
  "55853": "Not violets?",
  "55854": "And how did you find him?",
  "55855": "Of the breaking up of the frozen sea in their displeasure?",
  "55856": "What are they, then, doctor?",
  "55857": "What business have you with luxuries of that kind?",
  "55858": "I suppose you'll say there is nothing national about our literature either?",
  "55859": "Did he not excel in all the exercises and accomplishments proper to youth?",
  "55860": "What then will it be when it forms a judgment about anything aided by reason and deliberately?",
  "55861": "Who, my life?",
  "55862": "What would your aunt have said to it?",
  "55863": "Could he be certain that some conjuncture would not occur which would bring the mysterious personage on the scene?",
  "55864": "Surely that is all simple and obvious?",
  "55865": "What is it that drove you, impelled you, to separate yourself from the great natural path of marriage and the family?",
  "55866": "Could you tell me them, so that I can suit them to my purpose?",
  "55867": "You have nothing else to report to us before we go into this matter?",
  "55868": "So you're my nephew, are you?",
  "55869": "Has my horse had an extra feed?",
  "55870": "What, says I, have the galls been jiltin you?",
  "55871": "But why insult the poor, affront the great?",
  "55872": "WHY?",
  "55873": "Where you can be relieved?",
  "55874": "You know that they live securely and have nothing to apprehend from their servants?",
  "55875": "How dare you question me?",
  "55876": "Damon, what is the matter with you, that you speak like that?",
  "55877": "May I help myself again?",
  "55878": "Why did he ride away before I had time to ask him how his lord and lady do I?",
  "55879": "And do not good practices lead to virtue, and evil practices to vice?",
  "55880": "How can you say I am harsh, you naughty fondling?",
  "55881": "And you would really wish me to marry this girl?",
  "55882": "What were you doing at the moment you were arrested?",
  "55883": "Oh, what made you?",
  "55884": "Had they found the life of the body after all?",
  "55885": "Have all these, your friends, been there?",
  "55886": "How do you all do?",
  "55887": "Had he abandoned the effort, or was he continuing his journey along the route agreed upon?",
  "55888": "I never made a fool of you, did I?",
  "55889": "If he were an assassin, would I save him?",
  "55890": "What is the matter with you this morning?",
  "55891": "Why not end it all?",
  "55892": "What'll you take for that hide?",
  "55893": "And now, uncle, tell me where we are at the present moment?",
  "55894": "What were the causes of these events?",
  "55895": "What is it, my dear vicomte?",
  "55896": "What did you print last night?",
  "55897": "But why regard it as a crime, if they are sincere?",
  "55898": "Is it a criminal case?",
  "55899": "Now, shall I get whatever I ask for?",
  "55900": "You mean they've done her in?",
  "55901": "Would you believe it?",
  "55902": "Ought the public, therefore, to give no attention, it may be asked, to the education of the people ?",
  "55903": "May I look at your translation?",
  "55904": "Do you really mean that things are not so desperate after all?",
  "55905": "Where is my wife?",
  "55906": "Is the right of succession a right of accumulation or only a right of choice?",
  "55907": "Shall I, daughter of a noble sire, suffer the worst indignity?",
  "55908": "Your niece, is she?",
  "55909": "Do you think it will ever be in a settled state?",
  "55910": "Where was this to end?",
  "55911": "Why are you so melancholy, brother?",
  "55912": "But let me see, how was it done?",
  "55913": "To what other?",
  "55914": "But we have no naval imagination, and who am I, that I should advance an opinion?",
  "55915": "Or to snare stags with cords and caltrops?",
  "55916": "Your husband?",
  "55917": "What is the matter up there?",
  "55918": "What was the huge ship he was approaching?",
  "55919": "But who do you think it is?",
  "55920": "What power had he, then?",
  "55921": "Yet what was he but certain?",
  "55922": "But the figures?",
  "55923": "Who will come to pick it up?",
  "55924": "What on earth has the prince got to do with it?",
  "55925": "Would you not like to come into the house?",
  "55926": "Where do you come from?",
  "55927": "I asked if his lord was stirring?",
  "55928": "Had he not everything which fathers want for portionless daughters, and uncles for dependant nieces?",
  "55929": "Had not your honor appointed to meet me in a week?",
  "55930": "Have they big boats to cross the ocean?",
  "55931": "Name of any collateral or remote branch of your ladyship's family?",
  "55932": "But next to you then, who is the strongest?",
  "55933": "How am I to understand you, monseigneur?",
  "55934": "Why was I dumb at such a crisis?",
  "55935": "Curse you?",
  "55936": "Were their faces set in the right or in the wrong direction?",
  "55937": "By the orders of the deputy procureur?",
  "55938": "Have you got the toothache?",
  "55939": "Had you begun to write it?",
  "55940": "Can you suppose there's any harm in looking as cheerful and being as cheerful as our poor circumstances will permit?",
  "55941": "Which nurse was that?",
  "55942": "How are they to be governed?",
  "55943": "And you're not surprised?",
  "55944": "Why are you so cross?",
  "55945": "Will you see if that fellow has gone out?",
  "55946": "Oh, oh, so he has saved her life?",
  "55947": "Well, then, what would either of you gentlemen have done, if you had been in my position?",
  "55948": "Have I done so?",
  "55949": "And you, my dear boy?",
  "55950": "How long must we still ride?",
  "55951": "Do you know that you run a risk of being lost in the marshes?",
  "55952": "He is alone?",
  "55953": "That he has never spoken of him?",
  "55954": "Why should the chauffeurs tackle the girl?",
  "55955": "Have you been asleep?",
  "55956": "Here is a very good family revolver, or would you like a roof garden size?",
  "55957": "Well, but how is this?",
  "55958": "I wonder whether it will be expected of me that I should forgive him?",
  "55959": "Holloa, old fellow, how are you?",
  "55960": "How much are you going to get?",
  "55961": "Shall we let him say it, or not?",
  "55962": "HIM an injury?",
  "55963": "How meaning?",
  "55964": "You'd never think it, to look at him now, would you?",
  "55965": "On his ignorance?",
  "55966": "Consent to what?",
  "55967": "Where are the birds?",
  "55968": "Why should they be?",
  "55969": "Did any one indeed exist, except I, the creator, who would believe, unless his senses convinced him, in the existence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance which I had let loose upon the world?",
  "55970": "Where can you find an object of more compassion, than where there is the greatest misery in the world?",
  "55971": "A clam for supper?",
  "55972": "About her?",
  "55973": "Is the king wounded?",
  "55974": "And it arrived very speedily?",
  "55975": "May I suggest a compromise?",
  "55976": "Was it the heroism of a martyr?",
  "55977": "Shall we join up our packs?",
  "55978": "You are married, then?",
  "55979": "Can I sit down?",
  "55980": "How could you imagine it?",
  "55981": "But what is this ?",
  "55982": "Oh, the ghost left a fan, did he?",
  "55983": "What's the matter, sir?",
  "55984": "Where in the devil's name are they gone?",
  "55985": "How far?",
  "55986": "Why not, monseigneur?",
  "55987": "Would you mind telling my husband?",
  "55988": "How came he into the room?",
  "55989": "You will excuse me?",
  "55990": "And is not that farthest from reason which is at the greatest distance from law and order?",
  "55991": "And can you get a lever?",
  "55992": "Now, where is the proper place to break it?",
  "55993": "And you believe that?",
  "55994": "What's wrong with the order?",
  "55995": "My friends, of what else have we partaken?",
  "55996": "Albert?",
  "55997": "Your friend?",
  "55998": "Well, and this rivalry estranged them more?",
  "55999": "What are we to do, then?",
  "56000": "Where did you come from?",
  "56001": "What's she talking about?",
  "56002": "And how shall I receive information?",
  "56003": "How did you come by it?",
  "56004": "Protest from the insurance people?",
  "56005": "Some more?",
  "56006": "Which of you knows this coast well?",
  "56007": "You think of death?",
  "56008": "For the mother's?",
  "56009": "And who told you this fine story, sire?",
  "56010": "How are the boys and the baby?",
  "56011": "Do you mean it?",
  "56012": "I have done every thing that I could to prevent this expedition, have I not?",
  "56013": "But how can you get home?",
  "56014": "And what do the women do?",
  "56015": "You mean when she has your money?",
  "56016": "What right have I to be offended?",
  "56017": "With a wood round it?",
  "56018": "How large an army can you assemble?",
  "56019": "Was there any doubt as to who had made that mighty trail?",
  "56020": "Do you think we've eaten her?",
  "56021": "Do you believe you could bear that patiently?",
  "56022": "He recollects what it is, does he?",
  "56023": "Carry out what?",
  "56024": "What circumstances?",
  "56025": "Try, and not do it?",
  "56026": "What sort of a noise?",
  "56027": "What's your name?",
  "56028": "Whose secret?",
  "56029": "Or must I be stifled with the stench of him?",
  "56030": "Have I ever broken my word?",
  "56031": "How could it occur to her to examine the letter, to look at it critically as a profession of love?",
  "56032": "Since you had already given the matter publicity, why did you object just now, when I began to speak of it to my friends?",
  "56033": "So that old scoundrel's dead, is he?",
  "56034": "Now, what is the cause of this difference in the fortune of the philosopher and the mathematician, the former of whom follows the path of conceptions, while the latter pursues that of intuitions, which he represents, a priori, in correspondence with his conceptions?",
  "56035": "Who's me?",
  "56036": "How fetch it down again?",
  "56037": "These, then, are the two kinds of style?",
  "56038": "What's the use to wait?",
  "56039": "Or can there be no one here?",
  "56040": "How was this deficit possible?",
  "56041": "No cause to mourn, who have a brother lost?",
  "56042": "Did you hear the message?",
  "56043": "Then, my lord, it is a week that you desire me to wait?",
  "56044": "Have you had a case before in a house where they kept a motor?",
  "56045": "Deliciously restful, and you, my dear child, how did you sleep?",
  "56046": "Endless, did I say?",
  "56047": "Is it an insurrection?",
  "56048": "And if this person be not a smuggler, who is he?",
  "56049": "Care?",
  "56050": "You had worked that out, had you?",
  "56051": "What is the matter with you, my friend?",
  "56052": "Whom do you mean, ma'am?",
  "56053": "Is it not so, cousin?",
  "56054": "Perhaps you had not expected to see me?",
  "56055": "If the accident had so shaken his fellows, what would not the reality do?",
  "56056": "Plainly?",
  "56057": "Are you trying to get inside me?",
  "56058": "The queen and the duke?",
  "56059": "Was the rain the FINALE of the storm?",
  "56060": "Who makes them tear around so?",
  "56061": "What does a man tell a lie like that for?",
  "56062": "Well, is ev'wything weady?",
  "56063": "Why do YOU come here?",
  "56064": "What's the matter this morning, anyway?",
  "56065": "What's the matter, dearie?",
  "56066": "Suffer hunger?",
  "56067": "Of all this wretchedness?",
  "56068": "Why did you yield to their extortion?",
  "56069": "What kind of influence could it be which would account for all these different and contradictory effects?",
  "56070": "What is he waiting for?",
  "56071": "Am I strong enough to overcome all those obstacles?",
  "56072": "How is it that you have knowledge of me?",
  "56073": "You will not leave him?",
  "56074": "Can we not tarry here a little longer while you find the rest you need?",
  "56075": "Have you the cheek to ask how I am getting on?",
  "56076": "And now, my friends, have I said enough?",
  "56077": "Why should she turn so pale?",
  "56078": "But, do you ask, what assures me that that which I utter is true?",
  "56079": "Myself or some other woman?",
  "56080": "And how long will it take us to get there?",
  "56081": "I wished for the empire of the world, as who would not have done in my place?",
  "56082": "Is it that voice I hear?",
  "56083": "Why should I be vexed, my child?",
  "56084": "Right, my dear boy?",
  "56085": "How could you have the heart to cut them?",
  "56086": "And my mother?",
  "56087": "You at once rang for help?",
  "56088": "And when arrived at this dead point, what will become of us?",
  "56089": "Can rats walk down stairs, and come walking through the entry, and open a door when you've locked it and set a chair against it?",

  "56097": "Why when the eye has just seen the light, does the half light look dark to it, and in the same way if it turns from the darkness the half light look very bright?",
  "56098": "Should I by chance have done wrong, sire?",
  "56099": "I am sorry for him as a man, but what can one do?",
  "56100": "What is on it?",
  "56101": "What are you doing tomorrow then?",

  "56135": "Are you anxious about any part except the city and vicinity?",
  "56136": "What are you going to do with us?",
  "56137": "Do you think that is useful?",
  "56138": "Is it natural to suppose, that a command to do one thing is a prohibition to the doing of another, which there was a previous power to do, and which is not incompatible with the thing commanded to be done?",
  "56139": "Why has this fashion gone out?",
  "56140": "What, then, said he, do you beg pardon for?",
  "56141": "You are aware, sir, of the deplorable condition of my husband's father?",
  "56142": "Who can have done this?",
  "56143": "What do you think he said?",
  "56144": "What's out there?",
  "56145": "But if you like, why not?",
  "56146": "Oh, indeed?",
  "56147": "Who shall I say it is that sends me?",
  "56148": "Do you mean to say, I'm not, you dog?",
  "56149": "Is there anything else, monsieur, of which you have to inform me?",
  "56150": "How could he be found there?",
  "56151": "The treaty?",
  "56152": "Are you not coming in the carriage?",
  "56153": "What happened to you?",
  "56154": "The sun is beautiful, is it not?",
  "56155": "Why should I preserve faith with him who never kept any with me?",
  "56156": "What kind of stock?",
  "56157": "How dare you go and poke your officious nose into my family affairs?",
  "56158": "What can that noise be?",
  "56159": "You were at the festival of your marriage?",
  "56160": "Why, how's this?",
  "56161": "When are you to be married?",
  "56162": "How did I ever bear it?",
  "56163": "Did he show it you himself?",
  "56164": "How should you?",
  "56165": "Warm?",
  "56166": "Do they bite?",
  "56167": "And his dreadful fate did not check the efforts of others to explore that river?",
  "56168": "And you'll be sure to come?",
  "56169": "And you'll drink something?",
  "56170": "Tell me, was it true?",
  "56171": "Now, then, do you wish for anything else?",
  "56172": "Neveroff a dreamer?",
  "56173": "And this man, my lord?",
  "56174": "Is she all he thinks her?",
  "56175": "Is it not mere tautology?",
  "56176": "What degree of authority does she claim for herself in virtue of the apostolical succession of her ministers?",
  "56177": "But you do forgive me?",
  "56178": "Is it probable that such a combination would exist at all?",
  "56179": "Then the fun would begin?",
  "56180": "What's wrong with you?",
  "56181": "Will your folks worry?",
  "56182": "What did I say?",
  "56183": "Now if it be true that the living come from the dead, then our souls must exist in the other world, for if not, how could they have been born again?",
  "56184": "After him?",
  "56185": "Who has the countersign?",
  "56186": "What does it all mean?",
  "56187": "Manage what?",
  "56188": "And what of the maker of the bed?",
  "56189": "Said he wanted to, did he, my boy?",
  "56190": "What makes you think that poor young fellow could be an assassin?",
  "56191": "Should wages be governed by labor?",
  "56192": "Did you have any idea what sort of part you would like to get?",
  "56193": "To what circumstance do you allude?",
  "56194": "But you yourself?",
  "56195": "What vexed you?",
  "56196": "Or would she turn coldly away like all the hollow world?",
  "56197": "What did it matter how young or how old the girl might be?",
  "56198": "Is there none who holds the secret of these terrible bars?",
  "56199": "But she can make him keep her if he's married her?",
  "56200": "Was it right, for the sake of either of them, that an offer of marriage should be made at such a moment as this?",
  "56201": "What, what's the truth?",
  "56202": "To join the hussars?",
  "56203": "Will you give me a rose?",
  "56204": "Why is that?",
  "56205": "Did you take any cold that night you half drowned me?",
  "56206": "And the cargo?",
  "56207": "What's he talking about?",
  "56208": "Is there a telegram for me?",
  "56209": "What do you think of that exploit, my lord?",
  "56210": "What is too heavy a price to pay for having duty made at once clear and easy of fulfilment instead of very difficult?",
  "56211": "What is she doing?",
  "56212": "Why is that?",
  "56213": "Why have the economists kept silent?",
  "56214": "Cause the people to enjoy the benefits of education?",
  "56215": "Still by one of your forty methods, your highness?",
  "56216": "Is it not better than this place?",
  "56217": "Which is it you want, then?",
  "56218": "Who asked my sister down to meet him?",
  "56219": "Must we make an autopsy?",
  "56220": "And permanently so?",
  "56221": "Are you coming along with me?",
  "56222": "What answer could be made to this?",
  "56223": "Shropshire?",
  "56224": "Are you going to drown me?",
  "56225": "Was he doing this?",
  "56226": "And how do you maintain yourselves in the requisite medium?",
  "56227": "Is it like anyone you know?",
  "56228": "If not, why do things have names at all?",
  "56229": "And their driver?",
  "56230": "Would it be right for me to do so too?",
  "56231": "But why did you come hither?",
  "56232": "To believe what?",
  "56233": "What should I do then?",
  "56234": "Could you eat any bread and meat?",
  "56235": "Do you really think the children are better for being roused to consciousness?",
  "56236": "Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?",
  "56237": "Do you want to spread it all over?",
  "56238": "Is not this indeed, to understand charity well?",
  "56239": "On what principle is it that, when we see nothing but improvement behind us, we are to expect nothing but deterioration before us?",
  "56240": "If it is, in what does that necessity consist, what service does it perform, what is its business, and what are its merits?",
  "56241": "You are a financier, monsieur, I believe?",
  "56242": "Are you the gentleman?",
  "56243": "Where do you wish us to go?",
  "56244": "Should I marry?",
  "56245": "Does light require enlightenment?",
  "56246": "You are so false, and untrue, how could you know anything?",
  "56247": "Ah, you understand not a word of what she says?",
  "56248": "What is the intention of this fool's play, say then?",
  "56249": "Why should it be secret?",
  "56250": "Did you think I'd forget?",
  "56251": "Is his wife with him?",
  "56252": "Might we get closer to enlightenment?",
  "56253": "Is it a revolt?",
  "56254": "Why does he not come on?",
  "56255": "Your horse?",
  "56256": "What, silent still?",
  "56257": "Will you mind it, if I say something very, very silly?",
  "56258": "Were not the hours sometimes tedious even at home?",
  "56259": "What did he come for, then?",
  "56260": "Did you hear that are snap?",
  "56261": "What is it then?",
  "56262": "What, has she been here?",
  "56263": "Fernand, do you mean?",
  "56264": "And also to be within and between them?",
  "56265": "Was this possible or that possible?",
  "56266": "You call me a cobweb?",
  "56267": "And you are ruined?",
  "56268": "Well, do you want to get in a comedy or on the vaudeville or in the chorus?",
  "56269": "What do you want to unsettle me for?",
  "56270": "Do you threaten me, madame?",
  "56271": "And far from here?",
  "56272": "Must I confess?",
  "56273": "Are you unbaptized?",
  "56274": "My own showing?",
  "56275": "Was I mistaken?",
  "56276": "Who will discover this wonderful something?",
  "56277": "Destroyed?",
  "56278": "Did he excavate it?",
  "56279": "And where is the speaker?",
  "56280": "How are you and he getting on with your studies?",
  "56281": "Have you learnt how to shudder yet?",
  "56282": "Will you shake hands?",
  "56283": "Now is not this too bad?",
  "56284": "Besides, who but a prig would set himself high aims, or make high resolves at all?",
  "56285": "When, how, why had this hair been shut up in this drawer?",
  "56286": "How much weighs each bag of tools?",
  "56287": "Is she a political one?",
  "56288": "Does his mother then, keep poisons in her laboratory?",
  "56289": "Am I to understand, then, that I have received no promise?",
  "56290": "Did I hinder you?",
  "56291": "Which was he to take?",
  "56292": "Who's that?",
  "56293": "Can you tell me?",
  "56294": "Or is she an elfish spirit, who, as the legends of our childhood taught us, is forbidden to cross a running stream?",
  "56295": "Why ask me?",
  "56296": "Which means?",
  "56297": "But in a government which is to be well founded, will it be best to admit of a community in everything which is capable thereof, or only in some particulars, but in others not?",
  "56298": "Will he agree?",
  "56299": "Will ten pounds do it, sir?",
  "56300": "Shining, is it?",
  "56301": "Can he leave the island if he likes?",
  "56302": "But how is he now?",
  "56303": "A bird or a peacock?",
  "56304": "Speak, you old cent per cent fornicator?",
  "56305": "If it's any of my business, how the devil did you ever get into that bally jungle?",
  "56306": "Where does man come in?",
  "56307": "Should we be here now if they were brave?",
  "56308": "Sir?",
  "56309": "And what does she say, requiring consideration?",
  "56310": "What had happened?",
  "56311": "Where is she staying?",
  "56312": "Did it spread towards other parts of the island?",
  "56313": "The garden?",
  "56314": "Do you think it's possible?",
  "56315": "I suppose they were government matches, then?",
  "56316": "You knew him?",
  "56317": "What was the fair lady's game?",
  "56318": "Is it war?",
  "56319": "I am still young, am I not?",
  "56320": "A great man?",
  "56321": "How did you get in if both houses were empty?",
  "56322": "Where could she be?",
  "56323": "Will you take me in your company?",
  "56324": "How do you expect me to know such things?",
  "56325": "Then the just soul and the just man will live well, and the unjust man will live ill?",
  "56326": "And how does he clean the boots?",
  "56327": "Has C, a hatter, the right to force D, his neighbor and also a hatter, to close his shop, and cease his business?",
  "56328": "When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did they not lick his blood?",
  "56329": "Where do you land?",
  "56330": "Yet you cried out?",
  "56331": "Perhaps the other gentleman called, sir?",
  "56332": "Do you know what that is a warning of?",
  "56333": "Have you turned the case over in your mind?",
  "56334": "Why should I not confess it, gentlemen?",
  "56335": "Am I worse than I believe myself to be?",
  "56336": "How about moving that drugget?",
  "56337": "But you had a gun and bayonet besides?",
  "56338": "Do I sing?",
  "56339": "What do I want?",
  "56340": "What man?",
  "56341": "At good profit?",
  "56342": "Carton?",
  "56343": "And advancing?",
  "56344": "You are in mourning for some near relation?",
  "56345": "Do you know any who belong to the latter category?",
  "56346": "Now, what do you say about her doctor?",
  "56347": "Did your worship speak to me?",
  "56348": "Who are these people?",
  "56349": "Could it be an impartial one?",
  "56350": "What do you down here, my friend?",
  "56351": "Could he suspect my true identity?",
  "56352": "And the women?",
  "56353": "Suppose I do not want to be happy, what is the source of the obligation?",
  "56354": "Or the generous deed out of selfishness?",
  "56355": "Were you sent here to praise me?",
  "56356": "How do you feel now, dear?",
  "56357": "She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?",
  "56358": "You know him, then?",
  "56359": "Will he always come when you call him?",
  "56360": "And what has that to do with me?",
  "56361": "Why compliment him on being a romantic reactionary aristocrat?",
  "56362": "In the first place, and before everything else, sir, is the news as bad in your opinion as I am asked to believe?",
  "56363": "But how was it that the grooms knew it?",
  "56364": "Will you appoint a meeting for six months hence?",
  "56365": "Find it easy?",
  "56366": "Were they going over to the other side?",
  "56367": "So you will send me that book, dear count?",
  "56368": "But it's over now?",
  "56369": "Am I talking?",
  "56370": "And to what?",
  "56371": "Have I always hated you so much?",
  "56372": "How does he use it?",
  "56373": "You will sing with me?",
  "56374": "Grant?",
  "56375": "What did I borrow?",
  "56376": "Am I not clearly designated in that, captain?",
  "56377": "And with what purpose could he do that?",
  "56378": "What is it that this polypragmonetic ardelion to all the fiends of hell doth aim at?",
  "56379": "What has happened that you should speak like that?",
  "56380": "What means, then, this dithyramb upon property?",
  "56381": "And where afterwards?",
  "56382": "What reason was there for assuming any probability of an uprising in the city?",
  "56383": "Ah, friends, what shall I do?",
  "56384": "Do we not both take from the poor people that which they can ill spare?",
  "56385": "What is the place, then, upon which we stand?",
  "56386": "Is he a man of fortune?",
  "56387": "How dare to repeat experiments that had failed so often?",
  "56388": "There is still another influence, what do you say to that?",
  "56389": "What makes you ask?",
  "56390": "Now, who can this other letter be from?",
  "56391": "But how is it he is not already returned?",
  "56392": "What is to be the manner of her death?",
  "56393": "Wizard?",
  "56394": "And, conversely, that which has less of truth will also have less of essence?",
  "56395": "You mean that they would shipwreck?",
  "56396": "Swinging by the chain?",
  "56397": "What put it into your head, little mother?",
  "56398": "Then it is very thin wine?",
  "56399": "Did I offer to hit him or did I not?",
  "56400": "And what temperature may that be?",
  "56401": "Have you a pair of silent shoes?",
  "56402": "Who else should do so?",
  "56403": "And to what effect?",
  "56404": "I shall meet them there, and who knows what future advantages may result from the interview?",
  "56405": "Could it have been aught but a shipwreck which had drawn it under the water?",
  "56406": "The song?",
  "56407": "Shall you go?",
  "56408": "How are you, my dear?",
  "56409": "Why then not trace the rights of man to the creation of man?",
  "56410": "How did you know about it?",
  "56411": "How about that?",
  "56412": "Who knows it?",
  "56413": "You were alluding to the jerking movement of my hand every time I try to reach for anything?",
  "56414": "What the devil was you afraid of?",
  "56415": "What did he do before he went?",
  "56416": "Your alphabet?",
  "56417": "What's up?",
  "56418": "Which house is that?",
  "56419": "What's your real name?",
  "56420": "Why were they so strangely silent?",
  "56421": "Is it an amusing story?",
  "56422": "You were, were you not?",
  "56423": "Do you find the answer?",
  "56424": "At last she is dead?",
  "56425": "Time to start?",
  "56426": "You understand?",
  "56427": "But how did you know that I was a prisoner back there?",
  "56428": "Wherein?",
  "56429": "Which do you prefer?",
  "56430": "What can be more gratifying than such a retrospect as this?",
  "56431": "What did she say?",
  "56432": "Oh, indeed?",
  "56433": "Besides, which am I to choose?",
  "56434": "Instead, then, of consecrating monopolies from which the holders are to derive no privilege save that of straightway losing, with the income, all the enjoyment thereof, why not decree the agrarian law at once?",
  "56435": "Go to?",
  "56436": "But how could I, a poor dazed village lad, avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best and wisest of men fall every day?",
  "56437": "Well, why not?",
  "56438": "What does it all mean?",
  "56439": "I may assume that there is a second to be mentioned?",
  "56440": "Your father is dead?",
  "56441": "Of whom?",
  "56442": "Natasha, you would not deceive me?",
  "56443": "What were you doing in the battle, my friend?",
  "56444": "But does not this expose himself more than me?",
  "56445": "And is not this the reason why of old love has been called a tyrant?",
  "56446": "What are you doing here?",
  "56447": "Why not take a number of banths and set them loose before us above ground?",
  "56448": "How long did he wear it?",
  "56449": "Is he not a prey which will always be within your grasp?",
  "56450": "What instructing do you think I should do?",
  "56451": "What took her away?",
  "56452": "Yes, how long?",
  "56453": "Is it not the separation of soul and body?",
  "56454": "It is said to have been a congestion of the brain, or apoplexy, which is the same thing, is it not?",
  "56455": "Executions?",
  "56456": "Have commissioned you to tell me what you have just stated?",
  "56457": "Remorse or regret?",
  "56458": "How am I to describe it?",
  "56459": "Tulkinghorn?",
  "56460": "Why are you smiling, prince?",
  "56461": "And if he had not, why did he take her again?",
  "56462": "That is your intention, is it not?",
  "56463": "Will it pass?",
  "56464": "Why did you pick him?",
  "56465": "Do you suppose these stoneless mounds hide no dust of what were men just as good?",
  "56466": "Where are those passionate eyes that appeal'd to my eyes in passion?",
  "56467": "What is it that you say you are going to do?",
  "56468": "What did she send?",
  "56469": "Should he find him at all?",
  "56470": "Why should I meddle?",
  "56471": "The earlier it might be, would it not be better?",
  "56472": "The theories say that, do they?",
  "56473": "And what hope was there that these designs would fail?",
  "56474": "Not from the photos I have showed you?",
  "56475": "Have you ever noticed that the ones we would love the most distractedly are those whom we never meet to know?",
  "56476": "Well, then, my lord, say, are you satisfied?",
  "56477": "Gentlemen, do you stare?",
  "56478": "Well, what do you want?",
  "56479": "Why, monsieur, what secret can you expect to find in the hollow head of a soldier?",
  "56480": "Are you going to return there?",
  "56481": "What need has it of exaggeration?",
  "56482": "What if she loves you now better than anyone?",
  "56483": "Do you happen to know any one in this neighbourhood who would receive him for a while on my paying for him beforehand?",
  "56484": "He has done his best, but what does a fish's best come to when the fish is out of water?",
  "56485": "You are a reactionary, then?",
  "56486": "What's up, anyhow?",
  "56487": "Will there, indeed?",
  "56488": "Who drove you to it?",
  "56489": "We being strangers here, how dare you trust so great a charge from your own custody?",
  "56490": "You are a wheelwright?",
  "56491": "Does that suit you?",
  "56492": "Is anything the matter, aunt?",
  "56493": "And shall we just carelessly allow children to hear any casual tales which may be devised by casual persons, and to receive into their minds ideas for the most part the very opposite of those which we should wish them to have when they are grown up?",
  "56494": "But did be profess any attachment?",
  "56495": "Who are you, madame?",
  "56496": "Did you ever taste beer?",
  "56497": "Boomer?",
  "56498": "Does he mean to say that?",
  "56499": "How much fudder is got for go?",
  "56500": "And when hereafter, for any cause, the people in this place shall desire to find new homes, if they wish to be rid of the institution, where will they find the place to go to?",
  "56501": "And what would their parents think of me, if they saw or heard the children rioting, hatless, bonnetless, gloveless, and bootless, in the deep soft snow?",
  "56502": "Is anyone up in your house?",
  "56503": "Will that suit you?",
  "56504": "Have I not explained your wishes, grandpapa?",
  "56505": "Did you see it?",
  "56506": "And, to be frank, my lord, was I wrong?",
  "56507": "From what?",
  "56508": "Herod?",
  "56509": "Cautious, why so?",
  "56510": "Was it the better to deceive them both?",
  "56511": "Did you tell us?",
  "56512": "Do you understand what you have done to me?",
  "56513": "Nor church?",
  "56514": "Does it end with just our two selves?",
  "56515": "Will there be beds for me and all who seek?",
  "56516": "What virtue will there be then, said the monk, in their bullets of concupiscence, their habits and their bodies?",
  "56517": "How do I know?",
  "56518": "In what direction?",
  "56519": "And of such a man too?",
  "56520": "What good am I here?",
  "56521": "Do you mean what did I say?",
  "56522": "What did the whole world matter to them?",
  "56523": "You feel some pretty well now?",
  "56524": "The man says?",
  "56525": "How should I make a mistake?",
  "56526": "Will you have hash or fishballs for breakfast?",
  "56527": "What signifies?",
  "56528": "Did she mean to go out?",
  "56529": "Where is she?",
  "56530": "Do you know where they came from?",
  "56531": "Did you see him come out on us?",
  "56532": "Why lie awake nights worrying about this?",
  "56533": "And if I did not obey his call, who could answer for what might happen?",
  "56534": "Or worse than the parts they acted require?",
  "56535": "What did you go out for?",
  "56536": "Well, then, what's the sense in wasting the plates?",
  "56537": "Can we not, then, men of common sense, while awaiting the solution which the future will undoubtedly bring forth, prepare ourselves for this great transition by an analysis of the struggling powers, as well as their positive and negative qualities?",
  "56538": "Have you not lately renewed your promise?",
  "56539": "Whose are these beautiful green meadows?",
  "56540": "And why do we set our soul and body, which are such dear companions, at such variance?",
  "56541": "Living together?",
  "56542": "Did you never hear it?",
  "56543": "And what else is paper currency?",
  "56544": "And do you propose to make this journey very shortly?",
  "56545": "But what if fresh disasters should take place?",
  "56546": "Who will say they were not beautiful?",
  "56547": "Is anybody to come and fetch me?",
  "56548": "But when?",
  "56549": "And what explanation is given of the girl's death?",
  "56550": "What was the dreadful thing I dreamed?",
  "56551": "I should think it was a very pleasant life, the married one, eh?",
  "56552": "But what shall we reply to the medals, undoubtedly genuine, which reckon the fifth year of his tribunitian power?",
  "56553": "Have we either of us ever rubbed thumbs over honestly gained farthings?",
  "56554": "Ah, you are the young woman come to look after my birds?",
  "56555": "Why could not I, going up to bed with my basket of keys, stop to sit down by her fire and accommodate myself for a little while to her, at least as well as to anybody else, and not trouble myself about the harmless things she said to me?",
  "56556": "In order, perhaps, to give countenance to the objection at any rate, it may be asked, is there not danger of an opposite bias in the national government, which may dispose it to endeavor to secure a monopoly of the federal administration to the landed class?",
  "56557": "How can we help it?",
  "56558": "Why do you ask such a question, I said, when you ought rather to be answering?",
  "56559": "Would you say six or four years?",
  "56560": "Would you shoot a poor, defenceless girl?",
  "56561": "Which is the duke?",
  "56562": "Now, are you ready?",
  "56563": "Can you write shorthand?",
  "56564": "Yes, why did I not steal?",
  "56565": "Will you say it is because the body is the medium of suffering in this life?",
  "56566": "Now you will be able to go home and tell your friends that you have personally seen and heard the southern lights, for I suppose you have no doubt that you have really done so?",
  "56567": "And are who what?",
  "56568": "You are of my opinion?",
  "56569": "Could it be possible that the squire was going to make a fool of himself and get married?",
  "56570": "But you will?",
  "56571": "How much is it?",
  "56572": "You will permit me to consider him an invalid?",
  "56573": "Where is he concealed?",
  "56574": "But was it his fault?",
  "56575": "You spoke to my coachman, then?",
  "56576": "Was the photograph a cabinet?",
  "56577": "Who's go dar?",
  "56578": "For the commission, is it not my whole future?",
  "56579": "Why all this excitement?",
  "56580": "Do you know the numbers?",
  "56581": "Do you wish you may die if you do know, hey?",
  "56582": "Why then should he repine when the hour of separation arrives?",
  "56583": "She had no reason for walking elsewhere, and why should she not go that way?",
  "56584": "Where is the knave?",
  "56585": "Any news, father?",
  "56586": "When did you see him last?",
  "56587": "Why, pray, did he add the old day?",
  "56588": "You think he went off just by chance?",
  "56589": "Is the cause of my soreness such a mystery that there's any need to tell me I am sore everywhere the staff hit me?",
  "56590": "What be these two, signior?",
  "56591": "Can anyone here play the drum?",
  "56592": "Shall you like to have such a brother?",
  "56593": "And what is better than woman?",
  "56594": "Ye much hurt?",
  "56595": "How shall I ever look this man in the face again?",
  "56596": "Yes?",
  "56597": "You think there may be fighting?",
  "56598": "Could it be that by some neglect in the preparations, the substitution perhaps of the wrong brandy, the astralization could not be effected?",
  "56599": "Was this to her doom after all?",
  "56600": "How agreed?",
  "56601": "And those papers?",
  "56602": "How is the gentleman called?",
  "56603": "What do you mean, you minx?",
  "56604": "What can be done?",
  "56605": "And why are we here?",
  "56606": "Amontillado ?",
  "56607": "A coffin?",
  "56608": "Does it suggest anything to your mind?",
  "56609": "Is the second floor at home?",
  "56610": "Could I forget that last autumn at this same day of the month and at this same place you lighted exactly such a fire as a signal for me to come and see you?",
  "56611": "You are certain?",
  "56612": "Why, did you not hear all we said?",
  "56613": "How, how?",
  "56614": "Is this statement true?",
  "56615": "How would you find experimentally the relative quantities of heat given off when equal weights of sulphur, phosphorus, and carbon are thoroughly burned?",
  "56616": "Then it is my place to ask you what you are going to do about it?",
  "56617": "Why are you up so early, my dear?",
  "56618": "Who will tell her?",
  "56619": "Guilty, of course?",
  "56620": "Do you laugh, you unfeeling brute, as if you enjoyed my distress?",
  "56621": "What enjoyment is there in making love to a woman who belongs to nobody and yet belongs to any one?",
  "56622": "Have you not a word to say to me?",
  "56623": "Two drunken men, eh?",
  "56624": "What need they torture their heads with that which others have taken so strictly and so unalterably into their own purveying?",
  "56625": "What can be more natural and characteristic?",
  "56626": "Is there anything particular?",
  "56627": "What are you upset about?",
  "56628": "But the bogus inspector?",
  "56629": "And where are the children?",
  "56630": "There are then people who inhabit it?",
  "56631": "Her happiness?",
  "56632": "Please, ma'am, could I inquire if this highly instructive and charming institution is a new one?",
  "56633": "Is it not conceivable, at least, that obedience to an unselfish impulse may result even in the sacrifice of the opportunities of moral culture in general?",
  "56634": "But why not?",
  "56635": "How would they address us?",
  "56636": "Is there any thing new in this doctrine?",
  "56637": "What was she to say to him?",
  "56638": "You doubt it then?",
  "56639": "What sense is there in murdering a man in order to define one's relation to a guilty wife and son?",
  "56640": "And what are the comforts or the education which a race of beings corrupted from their infancy, and unacquainted with all the duties of life, are fitted to bestow?",
  "56641": "Then this new kind of knowledge must have an additional quality?",
  "56642": "How do you mean, bold?",
  "56643": "They taught you that?",
  "56644": "But you, critic, the reader undoubtedly will ask, what is your solution?",
  "56645": "But the heat developed by the rapidity of the projectile in crossing the strata of air?",
  "56646": "Well, are you trying to make out that I've said you have?",
  "56647": "Three days ago?",
  "56648": "What is it, a man?",
  "56649": "Whom do you think that is to?",
  "56650": "The lighted window, right up there?",
  "56651": "But if I lose?",
  "56652": "There, who are you?",
  "56653": "Or, perhaps, you may have the precious object she wants in your collection?",

  "56655": "And what for?",
  "56656": "Should he place his catastrophe as a third associate in their felicity?",
  "56657": "Can you speak, lady?",
  "56658": "Do what?",
  "56659": "That so?",
  "56660": "And you followed the business of a tailor?",
  "56661": "But how did you gain them?",

  "56664": "Ca vous amuse, la vie?",
  "56665": "You would throw over one that has stood by you this five years in favour of a man that you never saw before in your life?",
  "56666": "Ceremonies then are a subsequent thing?",
  "56667": "What can be keeping him?",
  "56668": "Why do you laugh, sir?",
  "56669": "Should she speak to her?",
  "56670": "Should she open the door or should she not?",
  "56671": "Now, while you have tyranny in so great a degree walled in, and see your enemies over your heads, to what purpose is it to take counsel?",
  "56672": "You do not know that you love me?",
  "56673": "What in thunder has that to do with you?",
  "56674": "No one at home?",
  "56675": "How is it over?",
  "56676": "Is it business?",
  "56677": "What's a ball through the chest?",
  "56678": "Has he found time to tell you scandal about me?",
  "56679": "Well how can I help it?",
  "56680": "What has our providential rescue to do with altering your feelings toward me?",
  "56681": "Where is it now, the glory and the dream?",
  "56682": "When is one pleasure twice as great as another?",
  "56683": "Is marriage so demoralising as that?",
  "56684": "Did he take any luggage?",
  "56685": "Seeing the old man?",
  "56686": "But there were three races, were there not?",
  "56687": "Was it the effect of the balmy climate alone which recalled him to health?",
  "56688": "Is it paid for?",
  "56689": "Were you speaking of me?",
  "56690": "An emancipator?",
  "56691": "These are the orders, are they?",
  "56692": "Does SHE look like the mother of six?",
  "56693": "Who is the agent?",
  "56694": "What tilbury?",
  "56695": "How can we ever thank you?",
  "56696": "Is it probable?",
  "56697": "Kitchens?",
  "56698": "And then should not the charity be all the more profound, in proportion as the fall is great?",
  "56699": "How was he to get through his present difficulty?",
  "56700": "What have you to say?",
  "56701": "You know?",
  "56702": "Is there any place at liberty that you know of now, uncle, that I should do for?",
  "56703": "But, why should I conceal my sentiments?",
  "56704": "Whom do you mean by THEY?",
  "56705": "Their graces?",
  "56706": "Shall I call him?",
  "56707": "How and why could it be mistaken?",
  "56708": "What the devil do you mean by this?",
  "56709": "If a man in selecting a residence, do not fix on one where such prevail, how can he be wise?",
  "56710": "Well, mon cher, have you got the manifesto?",
  "56711": "How, you are going soon?",
  "56712": "So saying, he fixed his eyes upon me, and asked if I had seen him tremble?",
  "56713": "But the man who was under him?",
  "56714": "Did he still cherish hope?",
  "56715": "Why funny?",
  "56716": "What have I done?",
  "56717": "Do you know much of him?",
  "56718": "Are you quite ready, gentlemen?",
  "56719": "To get what's left me sold by auction?",
  "56720": "What is to be done in these circumstances?",
  "56721": "Could he be sure that he was not their accomplice?",
  "56722": "Did the people shout at all?",
  "56723": "Excuse me,' and you believe that is sufficient?",
  "56724": "I daresay you've heard of her?",
  "56725": "Perhaps you'd care to come in and have a drink on your way?",
  "56726": "Must I receive it, or leave it in the hands of the notary?",
  "56727": "What is the meaning of that?",
  "56728": "Oh, you know him?",
  "56729": "Sir, have you finished supper?",
  "56730": "What did I get by that?",
  "56731": "What has become of the faith which has hitherto carried you so bravely through all our difficulties?",
  "56732": "Then what will you have me say?",
  "56733": "Missus's?",
  "56734": "How, then, am I mad?",
  "56735": "Could you possibly wish for a more favorable conjunction of circumstances?",
  "56736": "How should I know?",
  "56737": "What had been his object?",
  "56738": "And would that be all?",
  "56739": "Do you remember that after less than a year of married life you stood on the verge of an abyss?",
  "56740": "Why should I die, then, or basely despair?",
  "56741": "And anyone else?",
  "56742": "And what did he tell 'ee next?",
  "56743": "Do you never feel sick of it?",
  "56744": "Was this precaution or humility?",
  "56745": "Any men on it?",
  "56746": "Was it possible they heard not?",
  "56747": "Why do men halt between two opinions, and expect impossibilities?",
  "56748": "What are you wanting?",
  "56749": "Will not the good people respond to a united and earnest appeal from us?",
  "56750": "But why should I not receive her?",
  "56751": "But from whom is that letter?",
  "56752": "Have you them?",
  "56753": "What, gentlemen, is your verdict?",
  "56754": "What's a tall man unless he fight?",
  "56755": "Did that person not come back, then?",
  "56756": "Was there any other spirit but rum in the room?",
  "56757": "Do you wish to know clearly celestial matters, what they rightly are?",

  "56760": "If the officer be accused of dishonesty, how shall it be made out?",
  "56761": "Where is the cure?",
  "56762": "Are you on the ground?",
  "56763": "You mentioned a fowl, I think?",
  "56764": "Upon what?",
  "56765": "Is not this an extraordinary tale?",
  "56766": "What are you meddling with my deeds for?",
  "56767": "Who is it, then, that you want to see?",
  "56768": "Is it to be yes at last?",
  "56769": "What made you think she would be here?",
  "56770": "WHO is in the room?",
  "56771": "What was there to be seen there?",
  "56772": "Was there left now nothing but to break off from the happy creative being, was the time up?",
  "56773": "You are not going out, uncle?",
  "56774": "What does it matter where it comes from?",
  "56775": "You are determined, then, to push your fortune in other lands?",
  "56776": "Why should I be ashamed of myself?",
  "56777": "And there are four of you?",
  "56778": "How will it do, how will it do?",
  "56779": "Did you see the libraries and schools!?",
  "56780": "I should like to know whether you have the same notion which I have of this study?",
  "56781": "Who is going to dress me?",
  "56782": "Think of who?",
  "56783": "What is it you want to distract you?",
  "56784": "Whose beneficence was like his?",
  "56785": "Who taught her?",
  "56786": "It was not he, then, you came to seek?",
  "56787": "Who'll have her?",
  "56788": "Did you speak to him?",
  "56789": "Have you seen fifty frightful men pass down from the cliffs into this forest, my children?",
  "56790": "Will your ladyship stay the night?",
  "56791": "What can he be picking up?",
  "56792": "Then why on earth does she do it?",
  "56793": "How could this be, sir?",
  "56794": "Shall I tell you why?",
  "56795": "What is the day of the month?",
  "56796": "What shall become of me?",
  "56797": "Well, have you made up your mind to this journey?",
  "56798": "And him you found?",
  "56799": "Did he get his brain fever, and then write all those terrible things, or had he some cause for it all?",
  "56800": "Was she young?",
  "56801": "Cosette?",
  "56802": "Have you seen?",
  "56803": "Where shall we go?",
  "56804": "Or what is this?",
  "56805": "Have you, indeed, my boy?",
  "56806": "Have you seen the general?",
  "56807": "But how should they know when the projectile had reached this neutral point situated at that distance, especially when neither themselves, nor the objects enclosed in the projectile, would be any longer subject to the laws of weight?",
  "56808": "What have you been doing during my absence?",
  "56809": "To you, eh?",
  "56810": "But can the musician by his art make men unmusical?",
  "56811": "Yet, when the sensibility is thus increased at the expense of reason, and even the imagination, why do philosophical men complain of their fickleness?",
  "56812": "Am I to suppose that you intend to lower yourself by marrying a young woman who cannot possibly have enjoyed any of the advantages of a lady's education?",
  "56813": "Well, and your guardian must be brave if he is to fight well?",
  "56814": "Has my girl any objection?",
  "56815": "Now, when the restriction is removed, what is to prevent it from going still farther?",
  "56816": "But, I say, do you make any progress in it?",
  "56817": "But who should less expect from you?",
  "56818": "I would have you consider seriously of it?",
  "56819": "And what money 'ud he want?",
  "56820": "What would you have, sir?",
  "56821": "Were they asleep?",
  "56822": "Yet if he is not the maker, what is he in relation to the bed?",
  "56823": "Of complexion and brown hair?",
  "56824": "Have they contributed to encourage the diligence, and to improve the abilities, of the teachers?",
  "56825": "What about marriage?",
  "56826": "My friend, whom, then, will you serve?",
  "56827": "How is it that justice and isolation always accompany each other?",
  "56828": "And how is it to be parried?",
  "56829": "The rabbit?",
  "56830": "What could he have wanted there?",
  "56831": "Rob?",
  "56832": "So there is a hole?",
  "56833": "Why pay rent?",
  "56834": "Should he try to catch her eye, and then raise his hat?",
  "56835": "The first question is, whether music is or is not to make a part of education?",
  "56836": "Will you do me the favor to explain this enigma to me?",
  "56837": "Is there any other point which you would like to ask about?",
  "56838": "The bed might have been let down by some artificial means?",
  "56839": "But what are you up to?",
  "56840": "But what about you, and the rowing?",
  "56841": "May I have a grill for dinner?",
  "56842": "What need he add to such a desperate proof in figures?",
  "56843": "Did you promise to marry her?",
  "56844": "Did you speculate any more?",
  "56845": "What, let me ask, is a man in and of himself?",
  "56846": "Why so much beating about the bush?",
  "56847": "Or am I not to know?",
  "56848": "What does your chamber open on?",
  "56849": "Come to where four roads meet?",
  "56850": "What's this round your neck?",
  "56851": "And which?",
  "56852": "Why do you want to do that at this particular time, when at every previous time that I have proposed it you have refused?",
  "56853": "What gallows?",
  "56854": "Do you think you can help me, dear grandpapa?",
  "56855": "Why do you sit out here all alone?",
  "56856": "O why was that so?",
  "56857": "You know what they say of my lodger?",
  "56858": "But if he gives you?",
  "56859": "What money is this?",
  "56860": "And would it be indiscreet to ask you the name of this powerful protector?",
  "56861": "I beg your pardon?",
  "56862": "What do you call liberty, monsieur?",
  "56863": "You'll mention that I called, perhaps?",
  "56864": "You notice my ring?",
  "56865": "What revenge?",
  "56866": "What say ye?",
  "56867": "Against your father?",
  "56868": "Is it all right in the new way?",
  "56869": "Are those horrid creatures gone?",
  "56870": "Why does he then exceed all bounds at once?",
  "56871": "How are you sure?",
  "56872": "Does any one live, who knows what set purposes you have, half as well as I do?",
  "56873": "Could it be that these were four words, and that they were intended to carry a message to me?",
  "56874": "There is nothing you desire?",
  "56875": "Will you let me make the tea?",
  "56876": "What else did he say to you?",
  "56877": "What is there in all that for me to think about?",
  "56878": "By pulling out a bar and pushing down a door?",
  "56879": "Aye?",
  "56880": "Well, miss?",
  "56881": "But what was to be done?",
  "56882": "Was the projectile under some foreign influence?",
  "56883": "Will you begin, if you please, and put in the thatch again, just as if you were doing it for your mother's cabin?",
  "56884": "Shall we not set forth?",
  "56885": "Do you, sir?",
  "56886": "Do you think this does?",
  "56887": "Do you think you could hustle something in the way of a little lunch, old man?",
  "56888": "What could this NN be?",
  "56889": "And how did he behave, madam?",
  "56890": "How much do you require for my ransom?",
  "56891": "If the possibility of passing the limits of experience be admitted, by means of the dynamical law of the relation of an effect to its cause, what kind of conception shall we obtain by this procedure?",
  "56892": "But are your relatives so very poor?",
  "56893": "What is all this dancing up and down?",
  "56894": "If all were only vanity, who would mind it?",
  "56895": "Would I not give my life to secure it?",
  "56896": "But will his warriors consent?",
  "56897": "Why then should you expect me to pen this kind of affidavit, which has no object but to keep up a foolish partiality and secure a foolish bequest?",
  "56898": "But how did you proceed?",
  "56899": "What was it placed there for?",
  "56900": "Are YOU there?",
  "56901": "Or perhaps it is the pale morning light which takes your colour away?",
  "56902": "Why did you not bring it at once?",
  "56903": "The messenger that brought it, said would you be so good as read it by my lantern?",
  "56904": "If anyone arrives in my absence, do the honors for me, will you not?",
  "56905": "Has the breakfast been all right?",
  "56906": "Of what day?",
  "56907": "Has anyone?",
  "56908": "I trust you are in good health, and that your families are all well?",
  "56909": "Was it the fall of some mighty pillar of the globe?",
  "56910": "Well, what now?",
  "56911": "Think?",
  "56912": "And the youth repented, and became a good man?",
  "56913": "He rends defenseless women and little children in his lair, but how recently has one of you seen him fight with men?",
  "56914": "Pray, what may that portmanteau of yours weigh?",
  "56915": "You'll be sure to be stirring early and go with us?",
  "56916": "Will it be possible to draw water here tonight?",
  "56917": "Are any of the gallants within?",

  "57106": "What had become of her?",
  "57107": "To this I am willing, but is there none amongst us who has a better right?",
  "57108": "First floor?",
  "57109": "Then, what, sir, if I should convince you to your face of my sincerity?",
  "57110": "Why, what shall I learn?",
  "57111": "But what's to be done?",
  "57112": "And how is my father?",
  "57113": "Ah?",
  "57114": "And, to conclude the matter, what is even an eternal remembrance?",

  "57125": "Do you believe in spiritualism?",
  "57126": "And wherefore do you hate him?",
  "57127": "What is imagination?",
  "57128": "Nay, none?",
  "57129": "Where does the window of that look out to?",
  "57130": "And sack my stable?",
  "57131": "Like what, sir, eh?",
  "57132": "Could she still draw back after all he had done for her?",
  "57133": "For ought you not then immediately to be beaten and trampled on, bidding me sing, just as if you were entertaining cicadae?",
  "57134": "Shall I complain of him?",
  "57135": "What in the name of the devil is this thing?",

  "57140": "Would they be able to find a place to land, or would they go hurtling down into some awful crater, or be dashed upon the sharp peak of some mountain of the moon?",
  "57141": "But what was his business?",
  "57142": "But knowing the scheme they had planned, why should he offer to assist it?",
  "57143": "Might it not have been a long time already on the coast of the island?",

  "57154": "Show it me, will you?",
  "57155": "You have found the castaway?",
  "57156": "How are you getting on?",
  "57157": "Did he get all right?",
  "57158": "But how are you going to get it?",
  "57159": "How can I express it?",
  "57160": "Do you think my husband was too much inclined to welcome you?",
  "57161": "No bad thing, eh?",
  "57162": "This being so, how is it that, ever since the establishment of this balance, inequality has been on the increase?",

  "57319": "Do we gain anything by quieting one merely to open another, and probably a larger one?",
  "57320": "Have you found that out?",
  "57321": "What matter which?",
  "57322": "How then are we to make anything out of these lands with this encumbrance on them?",
  "57323": "What are you thinking about me?",
  "57324": "Like last time?",
  "57325": "Have you caught some disease?",
  "57326": "What do you think of such a commission as that?",
  "57327": "Now see here, will that be all?",
  "57328": "What I really want to know is what you meant by what you said to me the other day?",
  "57329": "Where did I get it, is it?",

  "57337": "Who could picture their agonies or measure their sufferings?",
  "57338": "Where in the world did you drop from?",
  "57339": "Will no one come to the succor of the human soul in that darkness?",
  "57340": "What else can you do?",
  "57341": "Are you going to be kissed?",
  "57342": "And when will you be back?",
  "57343": "But where did you get a rope?",
  "57344": "Then to them the good will be enemies and the evil will be their friends?",

  "57347": "What hash you been doin in dis lower world?",
  "57348": "But which of vs is to performe that part?",
  "57349": "Why should she have been so reticent at the time of the tragedy?",
  "57350": "Or might it suffice him that every wholesome growth should be converted into something deleterious and malignant at his touch?",
  "57351": "And why did she resist her seducer when she loved him?",
  "57352": "Have you come in here simply to bully me?",
  "57353": "But why did not such practical critics object to the constant presence in the poems of bronze weapons, in their age out of date, if they objected to the absence from the poems of the corslets with which they were familiar?",
  "57354": "Where are they, the forgotten generations?",
  "57355": "Is it surprising that it should be difficult for men to determine just what one country, or what one race, owes to another?",
  "57356": "Must not whatever CAN happen of all things have already happened, resulted, and gone by?",

  "57362": "And when shall we see this, captain?",
  "57363": "Why, who are you?",
  "57364": "What did he mean by that?",
  "57365": "Travel?",
  "57366": "Messiah or king?",
  "57367": "Must I again contrist myself?",
  "57368": "The matter, however, is not so obscure, but that even in common life we have every moment recourse to the principle of public utility, and ask, WHAT MUST BECOME OF THE WORLD, IF SUCH PRACTICES PREVAIL?",
  "57369": "Ought our country to remain in such cases dependent on foreign supply, precarious because liable to be interrupted?",
  "57370": "Anything to tempt you, sir?",
  "57371": "For what is it that their lifelong enemy shall now make profit by assuming to defend them against me, their lifelong friend?",
  "57372": "Was it not my disgust at the richest?",
  "57373": "Then in this case the narrative of the poet may be said to proceed by way of imitation?",
  "57374": "Did you hit it?",
  "57375": "Whom should she have married?",
  "57376": "A young woman?",
  "57377": "Are you SURE?",
  "57378": "But may I ask who are you?",
  "57379": "What say ye, fools?",
  "57380": "But what happened to me, a moment ago?",
  "57381": "Do I realize solemnly enough how utterly and irretrievably this little womanly thing is the creature of my good or bad faith and fortune?",

  "57384": "You bought them for yourself?",
  "57385": "Do you know anything of the sea?",
  "57386": "Have you heard?",
  "57387": "As his wife?",
  "57388": "Oh, you think it's a foolish thing, do you?",
  "57389": "Flip?",
  "57390": "And what did you do when you arrived at this conclusion?",
  "57391": "What do you expect us to do with a glass door, tubercle?",
  "57392": "How can a soulless thing be a spirit?",
  "57393": "But what need I know or care about this fellow, and his common niece?",
  "57394": "What's the meaning of that?",
  "57395": "Did you lock the front door?",
  "57396": "Do you understand that?",
  "57397": "What have you done?",
  "57398": "What does the angel of light or the angel of darkness say to that mind, at once implacable and generous?",
  "57399": "You have something particular, then, between you?",
  "57400": "Who is this devil of a man?",
  "57401": "What was I to do in the future to consolidate my authority?",
  "57402": "Did you ever hear of anything so dreadful?",
  "57403": "Who can fitly describe to you the great riches these women carry on their persons?",

  "57407": "Do you see this firman?",
  "57408": "What do you mean by all the rest?",
  "57409": "What, then, is the significance of what is called the postal reform?",
  "57410": "I suppose you think me a 'little fool,' as they all call me at home?",
  "57411": "And is't not possible to find it out?",
  "57412": "Where, then, is this love of the celestial father for his creatures?",
  "57413": "When you fell in love at first sight, how long, let me ask, did it take you to become ready to fling every other consideration to the winds except that of obtaining possession of the loved one?",
  "57414": "By whom posted?",
  "57415": "Can you tell me the time, ma'am?",
  "57416": "You perceive, then, that he is not happy?",

  "57421": "What is this rent?",
  "57422": "Then you've taken a good constitutional?",
  "57423": "He pays well, I hope?",
  "57424": "Why did he not apply for a passport as every one else does?",
  "57425": "Axel, have you got it?",
  "57426": "What's home?",
  "57427": "What could I gain by betraying you to those who have ruined my nation and my house?",
  "57428": "What's going to happen now?",
  "57429": "I suppose you want young ones?",
  "57430": "Back again at the old homestead, what?",
  "57431": "What name did you say?",
  "57432": "Why do you conduct yourself in this fashion toward me?",
  "57433": "You do not fear that the illness will return?",
  "57434": "And you would also acknowledge that the enchanted are those who change their minds either under the softer influence of pleasure, or the sterner influence of fear?",
  "57435": "Who can so minister to the inherent, perhaps barbaric remnant, love for display?",
  "57436": "Must it go in?",
  "57437": "Have I welcomed a traitor?",
  "57438": "Will you change your mind now, you blockhead?",
  "57439": "You advertised, I believe, for a salesman?",
  "57440": "Do you play on the guitar?",
  "57441": "Where should they be housed?",
  "57442": "Into the court, sir?",
  "57443": "But why need I go farther?",
  "57444": "Do you realise, father, that I've never had the least blow?",
  "57445": "And pray has he done so?",
  "57446": "How long since utility became a principle of law?",
  "57447": "Are they nice apples?",

  "57449": "Where meantime was the hapless owner of this wreck?",
  "57450": "What do you mean, my good fellow?",
  "57451": "How far do the cases differ in principle?",
  "57452": "Is it there or not?",
  "57453": "Visiting a sweetheart?",
  "57454": "Is it wrong to watch them?",
  "57455": "Begin to break her, like a poor caged bird, and wear her deluded life away, in teaching her to sing YOUR notes?",
  "57456": "What is our name?",
  "57457": "You are doubtless provided with pistols, gentlemen?",
  "57458": "What sins have we done?",
  "57459": "Did you never observe how imitations, beginning in early youth and continuing far into life, at length grow into habits and become a second nature, affecting body, voice, and mind?",
  "57460": "Help him?",
  "57461": "Could he throw no light?",
  "57462": "And what was the result?",
  "57463": "Well, how have you been?",
  "57464": "Why is not all this real?",
  "57465": "But how could he go away, leaving me in such a state?",
  "57466": "What became of her?",
  "57467": "Did she not always expect it?",
  "57468": "The husband?",
  "57469": "For the question still recurs, what motive first produces those instances of submission, which we imitate, and that train of actions, which produces the custom?",
  "57470": "Why did he ever forget it?",
  "57471": "How do you know what men would fall in love with?",
  "57472": "How do you know but that it hurts a geranium's feelings just to be called a geranium and nothing else?",
  "57473": "Did the person wish to smoke?",
  "57474": "Was it a bacchanalia?",
  "57475": "And what do you decide upon now, my lady?",
  "57476": "Well and when the money's gone, what then?",
  "57477": "Do you like that better?",
  "57478": "How did you get such huge huge hands?",
  "57479": "Who were the persons in whom he placed the greatest confidence, and who took the warmest interest in his schemes?",
  "57480": "I was going to say, the will to be interested in him has died, and what else matters?",
  "57481": "Are you satisfied now?",
  "57482": "My goodness, what utter twaddle, and what may all this nonsense have signified, pray?",
  "57483": "Of what must I repent?",
  "57484": "Surely not to throw yourself into the river?",
  "57485": "But of what use is it to fatigue myself with vain words?",
  "57486": "Then we may assume that our athletes will be able to fight with two or three times their own number?",
  "57487": "The philanthropist?",
  "57488": "Why, are they after him yet?",
  "57489": "And will he not, from his own interest in that species of property, be sufficiently prone to resist every attempt to prejudice or encumber it?",
  "57490": "Pet name props?",
  "57491": "And she kept her word?",
  "57492": "And what was the true measurement of the new little world?",
  "57493": "Why are they the happiest?",
  "57494": "Yes, my friend, but if so, when do we lose them?",
  "57495": "Can he not hold his water at reading of a ballad?",
  "57496": "I suppose you're very glad to go?",
  "57497": "What can he want with me?",
  "57498": "What have you been doing here?",
  "57499": "And if it departed how could it move unless it went upwards?",
  "57500": "What could he do else that would have been of the smallest use to her?",
  "57501": "But is there capital punishment where you were?",
  "57502": "Do we stop here?",
  "57503": "How many are they?",
  "57504": "Is it really?",
  "57505": "So that you were at rest?",
  "57506": "A little or much?",
  "57507": "Who then?",
  "57508": "Are you stupid?",
  "57509": "And what's your name?",
  "57510": "But how could I help it?",
  "57511": "Did she die very soon?",
  "57512": "Do you want me to adjudicate that too?",
  "57513": "What is that to me?",
  "57514": "Perhaps you never before noticed him?",
  "57515": "Why is it, I say, that you are thus agitated in relation to the domestic affairs of other communities?",
  "57516": "How can you talk so?",
  "57517": "Who told you that they have never done so?",
  "57518": "Have you got a sledge?",
  "57519": "Police, sir?",
  "57520": "But come whither?",
  "57521": "Then I have received a merely legitimate salary, in spite of the opinion of my confessor?",
  "57522": "But where was the novelty?",
  "57523": "Where is your wife, in the first place?",
  "57524": "And where did the dream come from?",
  "57525": "And what shall I do if you desert me?",
  "57526": "How, nowhere?",
  "57527": "Do you know what we are eating here?",
  "57528": "Yes, but how much?",
  "57529": "Grow pale, fear, calculate?",
  "57530": "Go on the stage?",
  "57531": "Wood?",
  "57532": "What are my heart's experiences?",
  "57533": "What is the ego?",
  "57534": "And how much did she give you for this fine enterprise?",
  "57535": "Was there no means of calming this angry sea?",
  "57536": "What did he say to that?",
  "57537": "Do about you?",
  "57538": "What's the sense of it?",
  "57539": "Where is the guilty party here?",
  "57540": "And what happened to him afterwards?",
  "57541": "Is it a duty to postpone everything to a sense of injuries, and wrong to gratify a mother in a request like this?",
  "57542": "What will you do?",
  "57543": "Anything else, my lord?",
  "57544": "Dear mother, are you so resolved?",
  "57545": "But she is proud, is she not?",
  "57546": "But what does the thermometer say?",
  "57547": "Can you ask that question?",
  "57548": "What's become of them, the dear fellows?",
  "57549": "Why are you travelling?",
  "57550": "How should they use it?",
  "57551": "Does he speak to you of this conspiracy?",
  "57552": "And was SHE married?",
  "57553": "You left your door open?",
  "57554": "Is there danger of another?",
  "57555": "What had her infancy been?",
  "57556": "How much money have you left?",
  "57557": "What is the matter?",
  "57558": "But what were you going to say?",
  "57559": "She is no relation of his?",
  "57560": "What hard fortune brought us here?",
  "57561": "What if she were so called?",
  "57562": "In other words, should strict impartiality be aimed at?",
  "57563": "And what did he offer?",
  "57564": "Why not go and try to get speech of him and beg for justice?",
  "57565": "What shall you do in life?",
  "57566": "Was not that nearly what you said?",
  "57567": "Is not this a free country?",
  "57568": "Which of these will be mine?",
  "57569": "How did you happen to be taken to a hospital?",
  "57570": "What is it?",
  "57571": "I brought it to the table near the fire, and asked him what he would have?",
  "57572": "Do you remember what you told me once, about her making all the apple parsties and doing all the cooking?",
  "57573": "Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind?",
  "57574": "Does this prove that ignorance and dependence domesticate them?",
  "57575": "Why do you not see this?",
  "57576": "What is it makes the wolves to leave the woods?",
  "57577": "It is useless?",
  "57578": "Mad, is he?",
  "57579": "Is it a pure a priori, or is it an empirical intuition?",
  "57580": "Why does it not encourage its citizens to put out its faults, and do better than it would have them?",
  "57581": "Have you told them where to find me?",
  "57582": "Where, then, is the ship?",
  "57583": "I'm not very exacting, am I?",
  "57584": "And in what state of mind has he returned to you?",
  "57585": "What was it that he did?",
  "57586": "Well, then, tell us frankly, what do you think of her personal appearance?",
  "57587": "Why, for example, should the king of a primitive community be prohibited from sleeping lying down?",
  "57588": "Where am I to join on?",
  "57589": "What right have you to bid me leave this house, sir?",
  "57590": "Who would endure this for many lives?",
  "57591": "Which is best off?",
  "57592": "Tell me, where is the place that men call hell?",
  "57593": "Then will she die too?",
  "57594": "Need it be said that no such measures could destroy that tendency?",
  "57595": "Well as he knew how to resolve characters into their elements, would he have been able to combine those elements in such a manner as to make up a man, a real, living, individual man?",
  "57596": "Od's precious, come away, man, what do you mean?",
  "57597": "May I go and help carry the things to the poor little children?",
  "57598": "Have heard them say that there is nothing pleasanter than to get rid of their pain?",
  "57599": "Who could see?",
  "57600": "Have you any more to stake?",
  "57601": "What shall you tell her?",
  "57602": "What like is he?",
  "57603": "Is this of envy or no?",
  "57604": "Why, WHY do they torment me and say I am going to marry you?",
  "57605": "If I went to sleep as I proposed, how could the atmosphere in the chamber be regenerated in the interim?",
  "57606": "I suppose you have searched her desk and things?",
  "57607": "What, after all, was this new oath?",
  "57608": "What then are we to conclude from these facts and considerations?",
  "57609": "How might it fare more gently with you in all the world?",
  "57610": "What avarice?",
  "57611": "Hurt me?",
  "57612": "Who's not playing fair?",
  "57613": "They were none of them among our friends at the lodge, then?",
  "57614": "Has it been so kept?",
  "57615": "So you are going away in the fall?",
  "57616": "In the flesh?",
  "57617": "Where is my wife?",
  "57618": "And had he married the valiant matron's daughter, as he promised?",
  "57619": "Whatcher take me for, hey?",
  "57620": "What do you mean, the rabbit?",
  "57621": "Now what do you say?",
  "57622": "And what sort of men do they graduate?",
  "57623": "He knew then?",
  "57624": "What was she insolent about?",
  "57625": "Do you not see his heart is fast breaking?",
  "57626": "Can this be possible, uncle?",
  "57627": "Why should they?",
  "57628": "Have you forgotten the day?",
  "57629": "Do you see anything there?",
  "57630": "What is the object of this assembly?",
  "57631": "Good heavens, are you ill?",
  "57632": "Well, did you dig up the watch?",
  "57633": "You will arrest him?",
  "57634": "What uncanny secret did it hold?",
  "57635": "Why is she thus possessed, and why does she not spare herself?",
  "57636": "At any rate, you have some walks in the neighbourhood?",
  "57637": "You have been a soldier?",
  "57638": "But why a year?",
  "57639": "Who's that laughing at me?",
  "57640": "Where, then, would have been her navy, her trade and even her existence?",
  "57641": "What do you hear from your mother?",
  "57642": "How could I settle the point forever?",
  "57643": "What does that spell?",
  "57644": "He means to marry you?",
  "57645": "But would that be necessary?",
  "57646": "What did happen?",
  "57647": "Is the shepherd said to be just to his sheep and his dogs?",
  "57648": "Why do you keep the secrets of that man, when they mean death to so many?",
  "57649": "But if I pursue and nothing gain, what will it profit me to come up with him?",
  "57650": "Do you wish to get out?",
  "57651": "Clara, are you ready to come home?",
  "57652": "Did you ever hear of such ingratitude?",
  "57653": "The best school?",
  "57654": "Bread?",
  "57655": "Dare they to hope a poet for their friend?",
  "57656": "What do I deduce from this?",
  "57657": "When did that person come here, waiter?",
  "57658": "What has made you so disobedient and unfaithful?",
  "57659": "You're not in bed?",
  "57660": "What spot?",
  "57661": "What would become of this assertion, if, assuming in my turn the offensive, I should demonstrate that belief in the existence of bodies, or, in other words, in the reality of a purely corporeal nature, is untenable?",
  "57662": "Did he believe?",
  "57663": "And now, is this all you have to tell me?",
  "57664": "Could he forego the renown of being the first wit of his age?",
  "57665": "What was he hoping for?",
  "57666": "What name am I to say?",
  "57667": "Elm or fir, both of which abounded in the island?",
  "57668": "And why will they not?",
  "57669": "A new one?",
  "57670": "What if you should die first?",
  "57671": "As day by day the sun sank lower and lower in the sky, could he be certain that the luminary would ever retrace his heavenly road?",
  "57672": "Had they nothing else to say to one another?",
  "57673": "Who told you to steal?",
  "57674": "Did I not tell you how quick and resolute she was?",
  "57675": "Is there any example of an individual object that escaped the government of that law in the whole history of the world?",
  "57676": "Why tarry ye?",
  "57677": "Did he give a reason?",
  "57678": "How did you come here?",
  "57679": "Did I break through one of your rings, that you spread that damned ice on the causeway?",
  "57680": "He asked himself, or were they playing a part?",
  "57681": "Is it true that my mind is only a harmony, and my soul a vortex?",
  "57682": "But if I do fight, you will surely not object to giving me a lesson or two in shooting and fencing?",
  "57683": "Are we women?",
  "57684": "Have you more to say?",
  "57685": "What had really happened?",
  "57686": "For what is there more prompt, more unexpected, more abbreviatory of space and time, than the maturity of an obligation?",
  "57687": "Would they be right in the future?",
  "57688": "And what do you say is your surmise as to your present position?",
  "57689": "Suppose now I ask, why I rather than anybody else?",
  "57690": "If what?",
  "57691": "Have you a heart?",
  "57692": "With me?",
  "57693": "Did you ever hear of such an idea?",
  "57694": "Have you quite forgotten her?",
  "57695": "So you are good enough to pass my appearance?",
  "57696": "Is it tobacco?",
  "57697": "I ask you what can I do?",
  "57698": "Could it have been an early hornet?",
  "57699": "Who is that?",
  "57700": "Can you drink anything?",
  "57701": "Why not pursue an end confessedly good by peaceable and regular means?",
  "57702": "Did he come to arrest me?",
  "57703": "Whither so fast, child?",
  "57704": "Ah, why will you not unseal my lips?",
  "57705": "Does this look like confidence?",

  "57708": "And did they often get a chance to do that?",
  "57709": "And do I love?",
  "57710": "UNDER THE CROSS,' hey?",
  "57711": "What did you look at, so fixedly?",
  "57712": "Why stop?",
  "57713": "And of what are you so sure?",
  "57714": "And the friend he regards and describes as one in whom he has an interest, and the other as a stranger in whom he has no interest?",
  "57715": "For all that, are not our dresses as beautiful as yours?",
  "57716": "Why are they fighting?",
  "57717": "Is the danger you apprehended last night gone by now, sir?",
  "57718": "When the winds blow and the seas flow?",
  "57719": "Do you call this acting the part of a man and a gentleman, sir?",
  "57720": "Why should not I eat birds?",
  "57721": "A slap in the face?",
  "57722": "What have you to do with our independence?",
  "57723": "Are you sure you can get 'em out of their fix?",
  "57724": "What principle directed it?",
  "57725": "Besides, why should I say anything about it to him?",
  "57726": "How did you get this passport?",
  "57727": "The house is sold, then?",
  "57728": "What kind of person is she?",
  "57729": "Did he hear me?",
  "57730": "You were his constant companion, then?",
  "57731": "Is it not rather an appeal to the proprietory instinct, the COMMERCIAL instinct?",
  "57732": "Is that true, mother?",
  "57733": "How once?",
  "57734": "When an establishment has had the leisure to develop itself, enlarge its foundations, ballast itself with capital, and assure itself a body of patrons, what can the workman who has only his arms do against a power so superior?",
  "57735": "Well, and what does it signify whether it was he or I?",
  "57736": "What formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward?",
  "57737": "Would it be believed, that when near nineteen, any one could be so stupid as to build his hopes of future subsistence on an empty phial?",
  "57738": "For what?",
  "57739": "Is not this absurd?",
  "57740": "Do you know that I am to be beheaded outside this window?",
  "57741": "Eh, who's there?",
  "57742": "How many a year, did you say?",
  "57743": "You intend to show off your intelligence, I suppose?",
  "57744": "Did you want me?",
  "57745": "What are you talking about, man?",
  "57746": "Is it possible that even now, when I give you these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?",
  "57747": "But where were you going, when you met us?",
  "57748": "D'Artagnan?",
  "57749": "I wonder where I shall be this time tomorrow?",
  "57750": "Taenarum?",
  "57751": "Cannot you understand that the time it takes to wink is a whole eternity if it severs me from the beauty of your face?",
  "57752": "Tomorrow, then, sire?",
  "57753": "And who are you?",
  "57754": "What did ye?",
  "57755": "Did you put out the lamp?",
  "57756": "How long would it last?",
  "57757": "Who is still to come?",
  "57758": "Should he abandon this man?",
  "57759": "How about the others?",
  "57760": "Has he brought his brig with him?",
  "57761": "And what are my instructions?",
  "57762": "To make that reply and then perish, what could be grander?",

  "57765": "Would you like me to come with you now?",
  "57766": "Can you already understand?",
  "57767": "Were they in the front or in the rear of their generation?",
  "57768": "How could I be otherwise?",
  "57769": "On the contrary, but what dignity?",
  "57770": "Just now, but refrained out of politeness ?",
  "57771": "Are you trying to hide?",
  "57772": "Is the vicar in?",
  "57773": "How can you say such a thing?",
  "57774": "A secret?",
  "57775": "Did you want the carpenter, sir?",
  "57776": "Then why are you always alone in your room these days?",
  "57777": "Got shot?",
  "57778": "Who makes the waters flow?",
  "57779": "More money, I suppose?",
  "57780": "About you?",
  "57781": "You will be staying on here, I suppose?",
  "57782": "It is you who set out seven or eight months ago from your country to seek your fortune in the capital?",
  "57783": "Where's your uncle?",
  "57784": "Who in the world cares for YOU?",
  "57785": "Was it real, or only apparent?",
  "57786": "What is the difficulty?",
  "57787": "WHAT doth all the world know at present?",
  "57788": "Is there no ford?",
  "57789": "How came it to pass?",
  "57790": "Are you willing?",
  "57791": "Done with their buttons?",
  "57792": "Av you anything to say agen it?",
  "57793": "Could it have been a slight quivering of the nostrils that he had seen, or was it mad fancy playing a trick on him?",
  "57794": "Would it comfort, or would it wound you to have a similar painting?",
  "57795": "Who is in command here?",
  "57796": "Will you let me see you home?",
  "57797": "Will you take charge of the letter?",
  "57798": "Should not all that be eternal?",
  "57799": "But why prove that to me?",
  "57800": "And its aim is?",
  "57801": "What could be the meaning of such a change?",
  "57802": "Have there been any fresh developments?",
  "57803": "What are you about?",
  "57804": "I am to live at home?",
  "57805": "What joy would they have to bring hanging to the likes of me?",
  "57806": "Where did she go?",
  "57807": "But may I, mamma?",
  "57808": "And who are hearsed that die on the sea?",
  "57809": "How have you got here?",
  "57810": "How long has he left it?",
  "57811": "And whither am I to go?",
  "57812": "Now, from whom could these pages come?",
  "57813": "You will then be at my service?",
  "57814": "And pray, sir, what in the world is equal to it?",
  "57815": "Could it be that there should be happiness in store for her?",
  "57816": "And what would that be, think you?",
  "57817": "In whose name do you come?",
  "57818": "Why not have let me speak to you, above there, where it is light, and there is something stirring, instead of bringing us to this dark and dismal hole?",
  "57819": "Where is my hat?",
  "57820": "But we'll gie 'em another song?",
  "57821": "Yet could I, in justice, or even in possibility, refuse this demand?",
  "57822": "What is the meaning of this?",
  "57823": "Will your majesty permit me to tell you the truth?",
  "57824": "Whatever can be the matter?",
  "57825": "Had the cooling of the globe produced it?",
  "57826": "Are you and your party ready?",
  "57827": "Doubt?",
  "57828": "To whom do I surrender?",
  "57829": "Why, where have you seen her?",
  "57830": "Where have you hid him?",
  "57831": "Well, are you off to the front?",
  "57832": "Oh, is that so?",
  "57833": "Why should we give it?",
  "57834": "He asked me if I felt sure that I was as well as in the morning?",
  "57835": "Please will your grandfather lend us his fuelhouse to try over our parts in, tonight at seven o'clock?",
  "57836": "Well, what is it perplexes me?",
  "57837": "Is your honour mad?",
  "57838": "This dial with movable needle is a manometer, is it not?",
  "57839": "How could these men, who never had the faintest idea of statistics, valuation, or political economy, furnish us with principles of legislation?",
  "57840": "And how's it you're not afraid, sir, really now?",
  "57841": "This?",
  "57842": "Are you going to walk out with us after lunch?",
  "57843": "Have you been in it since your adventure?",
  "57844": "Wife with you?",
  "57845": "Why do you keep looking at me like that?",
  "57846": "Did he reject her eternally, or did he not?",
  "57847": "Will you not honor us by telling us who you are?",
  "57848": "Whom have you come from?",
  "57849": "Have you noticed these flowers?",
  "57850": "How much brandy may I drink?",

  "57856": "Interested, are you?",
  "57857": "If I'm as good as good can be all day tomorrow will you let me be just as bad as I like all the next day?",
  "57858": "For the father's?",
  "57859": "You're not turning your head to look after more moths, are you?",
  "57860": "And what more do you see?",
  "57861": "Do you answer me with a few regiments?",
  "57862": "Must the young men not look at the young women?",
  "57863": "Was it as she was about to take the veil that they had cast thither that love dowry as a pledge to the world of the living?",
  "57864": "Tell him what?",
  "57865": "Why had he done this?",
  "57866": "Had he seen his father?",
  "57867": "Whom do you bring?",
  "57868": "What does it matter about the trumpery cheque?",
  "57869": "But how could I live up to it?",
  "57870": "But when I assure you that you may rely on my tenderness?",
  "57871": "And what would be the use if she were?",
  "57872": "Have there, indeed, now?",

  "57874": "Why did men come to that once forbidding land ?",
  "57875": "What are you thinking of this evening?",
  "57876": "And do you now intend, on this account, to deny the debt?",
  "57877": "Are fathers unnatural, and children prodigal?",
  "57878": "Where shall I find a refuge?",
  "57879": "Who would live amidst perpetual wrangling, and scolding, and mutual reproaches?",
  "57880": "Why do you ask?",
  "57881": "Say?",
  "57882": "For how can the tears of my neighbour benefit me?",
  "57883": "Oh, where are you going, my lord?",
  "57884": "The officer of the guard, then, with his chessboard?",
  "57885": "Is it not then reasonable to infer that, if he had really been guilty of forming a base conspiracy against the fame and fortunes of a rival, he would have expressed some remorse for so serious a crime?",
  "57886": "Do you think the experiment will work?",
  "57887": "What is wrong?",
  "57888": "And can you send me to the station this afternoon?",
  "57889": "Nor him?",
  "57890": "And have these pets got anything on THEIR minds, eh?",
  "57891": "Had you any emeralds?",
  "57892": "And are you going?",
  "57893": "At what o'clock was it raised?",
  "57894": "All of them?",
  "57895": "Do you remember this?",
  "57896": "In the house?",
  "57897": "I say, what's the matter?",
  "57898": "Shall I go and dance before these demons and let them see what a human being can do?",
  "57899": "Why have men of superior endowments submitted to such degradation?",
  "57900": "You, a detective?",
  "57901": "Yes, but they are a long way off, those isles, are they not?",
  "57902": "Then after all my dreams, after all my patience, you do not love me at last?",
  "57903": "Now which are you going to marry?",
  "57904": "And how is your friend?",
  "57905": "Who forces you to do so?",
  "57906": "And his last promotion was due to you?",
  "57907": "Yes, you have seen him?",
  "57908": "Who could expect otherwise than that, with the prospect before him of viewing the giant among planets, ten times nearer than any mortal eye had ever done, he should have begrudged every moment that distracted his attention?",
  "57909": "I have?",
  "57910": "Which concerns me?",
  "57911": "But where will he find the knowledge which can enable him to enounce synthetical judgements in regard to things which transcend the region of experience?",
  "57912": "Neither of them there?",
  "57913": "I hope I find you pretty well?",
  "57914": "Died?",
  "57915": "Shall I take up your bucket, or will you go with me?",
  "57916": "Will you keep my child for me?",
  "57917": "What do I care for this country?",
  "57918": "Is there nothing that can be done?",
  "57919": "How did he know where chance might one day cast his companions and himself in the event of their leaving their domain?",
  "57920": "Do you think so?",
  "57921": "My man in the wrong?",
  "57922": "Are you in want of anything?",
  "57923": "Why do you talk nonsense?",
  "57924": "And how are all the bad governments in the world to be made good?",
  "57925": "What then is this rule of right?",
  "57926": "Where will you go?",
  "57927": "What for?",
  "57928": "Will fate play tricks upon me?",
  "57929": "Well, did he tell you that he draws three per cent of the gross receipts?",
  "57930": "And who are you?",
  "57931": "Remain at home and become an old maid and be laughed at?",
  "57932": "What devil brought them here?",
  "57933": "What people are these?",
  "57934": "You mean that you can no longer rely upon me?",
  "57935": "Have they?",
  "57936": "Or perhaps he may tell a lie because he is afraid of enemies?",
  "57937": "What crotchet is this?",
  "57938": "Is it therefore nothing?",
  "57939": "You told him it was for me?",
  "57940": "Are the young ladies and all the family quite well?",
  "57941": "That's all, is it?",
  "57942": "You will do everything sure?",
  "57943": "There was a child, was there not?",
  "57944": "And when is your next ball?",
  "57945": "Well, how are you getting on?",
  "57946": "Are you the first that this hand has stricken?",
  "57947": "Do you see this silver bugle?",
  "57948": "Was this altogether just?",
  "57949": "Going back?",
  "57950": "Should he find it in time?",
  "57951": "Can there be deliverance when there is eternal justice?",
  "57952": "Is it spoken to after death as if alive?",
  "57953": "Is that all the message?",
  "57954": "Did she make it clear why, on reaching her house, she ran into the back kitchen?",
  "57955": "If comedy be an imitation, under whatever conventions, of real life, how is it possible that it can have no reference to the great rule which directs life, and to feelings which are called forth by every incident of life?",
  "57956": "What must I do?",
  "57957": "Are they friends?",
  "57958": "There is no way of getting out?",
  "57959": "Shall you ever find such another?",
  "57960": "O, you'll slip your head out of the collar?",
  "57961": "The question I'm asking you is what shall we say to him?",
  "57962": "This he?",
  "57963": "How can you?",
  "57964": "Or, what more effective means to one's moral improvement?",
  "57965": "Why, what business can he have?",
  "57966": "Any more of whom?",
  "57967": "What more can I say for my client?",
  "57968": "And who are you?",
  "57969": "What is your demand?",
  "57970": "What do you propose to do with it?",
  "57971": "Doth he love us?",
  "57972": "What other satisfaction can it give me?",
  "57973": "Where will they be, and what will they say?",
  "57974": "Were there not currents higher up that would waft him to less arid regions?",
  "57975": "Are we not, uncle?",
  "57976": "A spare wheel?",
  "57977": "Now, why did he wish for this agent?",
  "57978": "Or some innocent out of the hospital, that would stand with her hands thus, and a plaise mouth, and look upon you?",
  "57979": "Or what are the inconveniences of a few months to the tributary bondage of ages?",
  "57980": "And are you really firm in your resolve?",
  "57981": "But what do they want?",
  "57982": "Do you remember the bishop's preaching against your father's chanting?",
  "57983": "Does she like it?",
  "57984": "Now what's the consequence?",
  "57985": "What was the cause of that malady?",
  "57986": "Have you ever seen a photograph of her first husband?",
  "57987": "By that means you got promotion?",
  "57988": "You dethroned the king?",
  "57989": "Is there no clue there?",
  "57990": "And where did he say that he lived?",
  "57991": "But why should I learn these things, that we all know?",
  "57992": "Who is it directed to?",
  "57993": "I wonder whether if I was to shut myself up in a cage for six months, it would do any good?",
  "57994": "For 'some' reason?",
  "57995": "Are these your good men, my dears?",
  "57996": "Where could it be hidden?",
  "57997": "I have heard curious tales about her before now, but if she came to invite us to her house, why did she behave so to my mother?",
  "57998": "Waiting for who?",
  "57999": "And why did you insist upon letting fall the bug, instead of a bullet, from the skull?",
  "58000": "How was he to back out of a matter in which his name was already so publicly concerned?",
  "58001": "How then are we to account for male mammals possessing mammae?",
  "58002": "But what is there interesting about it?",
  "58003": "Have you got clear of all your sins, cousin?",
  "58004": "What happened there, madam?",
  "58005": "Do I say right, mother?",
  "58006": "How did you get things settled?",
  "58007": "And did he mention that this is the ninth show he's done, and that seven of the others were just as big hits as this one?",
  "58008": "Have you ever known him ill?",
  "58009": "Shall I receive it from my father?",
  "58010": "Now I believe our accounts are settled, are they not, monsieur l'hote?",
  "58011": "Not handsome?",
  "58012": "Why are you worrying me?",
  "58013": "What, then, is the reason?",
  "58014": "I suppose you have a nightgown?",
  "58015": "How many should say there were on your side, doctor?",
  "58016": "I am sure you mean well, but are you quite certain that you know how to execute such a trust as this?",
  "58017": "Why did you not at once rid yourself of that abominable nightmare?",
  "58018": "Then the cardinal will be pleased with me?",
  "58019": "Well, do you think that it was she who stole the money?",
  "58020": "What holds my heart in anguish of suspense?",
  "58021": "But how about his food?",
  "58022": "I hope the accident has been of no consequence?",
  "58023": "And will not the bravest and wisest soul be least confused or deranged by any external influence?",
  "58024": "But wherefore are you here?",
  "58025": "What should she say?",
  "58026": "Who brings this?",
  "58027": "Is it philosophy?",
  "58028": "How may I counsel their death?",
  "58029": "By virtue of what right?",
  "58030": "How do you know that he values it highly?",
  "58031": "But your mother?",
  "58032": "How long are the holidays?",
  "58033": "But how can I sell out here?",
  "58034": "Why did he not call us?",
  "58035": "Euphrasie?",
  "58036": "Whither lead their steps?",
  "58037": "Might it reawake the dying nerve if the family were living close against her eyes?",
  "58038": "Well, who crossed me?",
  "58039": "How shall I ever get my heart?",
  "58040": "Well, shall we get home by evening?",
  "58041": "Whither are you taking me?",
  "58042": "Well, let me see, what can you want that begins with N?",
  "58043": "Who would believe it?",
  "58044": "And the brother and sister are pursuing their old course, are they?",
  "58045": "Why?",
  "58046": "For I ask any one, if upon mention of a right line he thinks not immediately on such a particular appearance, and if it is not by accident only that he considers this property?",
  "58047": "If you come to that, you know, how is anybody's tongue to be stopped?",
  "58048": "Do you happen to carry a box?",
  "58049": "How am I to say like that straight off?",
  "58050": "And her son?",
  "58051": "Whither are they going?",
  "58052": "He has soft, smooth paws, has he?",
  "58053": "What about my suit?",
  "58054": "Free them, and make them politically and socially our equals?",
  "58055": "Why did I not stop her?",
  "58056": "Who could it be?",
  "58057": "So what could I do, sir?",
  "58058": "What would you do in my position?",
  "58059": "Did you not see his face?",
  "58060": "Did I not come myself with the best and bravest I could bring?",
  "58061": "All is not then over?",
  "58062": "Did they alight on the road in the course of the night?",
  "58063": "Can it be religion?",
  "58064": "And you will have her named?",
  "58065": "And who cares whether you are sure or not, ma'am?",
  "58066": "Water?",
  "58067": "Will you be as careful as all that?",
  "58068": "How was it possible that these things could be taught too early?",
  "58069": "What was morality worth if it was not that which on the whole brought a man peace at the last, and could anyone have reasonable certainty that marriage would do this?",
  "58070": "Is anything the matter with her?",
  "58071": "What care I for renown and honor, if he is not there to see my greatness, and if his beaming eyes do not reflect back to me the light of my crown?",
  "58072": "Well, what's the row?",
  "58073": "Are you then yet angry with me that I did not comply with your first request?",
  "58074": "What has happened to him?",
  "58075": "Where in the world did you come from?",
  "58076": "Are they inside with the governor?",
  "58077": "Or what do you mean?",
  "58078": "He broke out, a great hopeless HOW ON EARTH CAN I KEEP YOU?",
  "58079": "And now, what is forbidden?",
  "58080": "And why was it so with her?",
  "58081": "A brazier of charcoal?",
  "58082": "What, therefore, is our conclusion?",
  "58083": "Who, senor?",
  "58084": "What shall we say, then, when he really sinks?",
  "58085": "Can I go?",
  "58086": "Is it not perfectly clear that the property of this industrious generation will stand on a basis of right, if the value or wealth produced by the activity of all be distributed among the producers, according to each one's assistance in the creation of the general wealth?",
  "58087": "Have those public endowments contributed in general, to promote the end of their institution ?",
  "58088": "And did it go off all right?",
  "58089": "Why are you so blinded by this world that you make, as you will find at the hour of death, no provision for the great necessity that will then come upon you?",
  "58090": "Is it possible to forget?",
  "58091": "Are you quite mad?",
  "58092": "Why did she weep?",
  "58093": "Have you heard him say anything out of the way?",
  "58094": "You're an engaged man?",

  "59635": "Was not the door closed?",
  "59636": "Why should one death be great, while our sacrifice is horrible?",
  "59637": "What food do you eat?",
  "59638": "Will your worship read it to me, noble sir?",
  "59639": "Where did the blood come from?",
  "59640": "Pretty smooth?",
  "59641": "By doing what clever trick?",
  "59642": "Is the deed of sale ready?",
  "59643": "Are we lost?",
  "59644": "A murder?",
  "59645": "Of what, then, does humanity repent?",
  "59646": "Or if honour or victory or courage, in that case the judgement of the ambitious or pugnacious would be the truest?",
  "59647": "When, where, how?",
  "59648": "What can mine own praise to mine own self bring?",
  "59649": "How could they be cordial with their sore consciences and shamed faces?",
  "59650": "Sith passed pleasures double but new woe?",
  "59651": "For you have neither relatives nor acquaintances whom you need fear to offend by living with me?",
  "59652": "How can ships sail this way and that?",
  "59653": "The stock is in your own hands?",
  "59654": "Is the danger apprehended from the other branches of the federal government?",
  "59655": "Who says it?",
  "59656": "What is going on, my lord?",
  "59657": "What can I want?",
  "59658": "How did you come up?",
  "59659": "His former love?",
  "59660": "Do you need help?",
  "59661": "Is he infirm?",
  "59662": "Jumped out of window?",
  "59663": "Why not simply issue a general order that you intend to do this?",
  "59664": "Do you like him?",
  "59665": "And the remorse of an adoring husband?",
  "59666": "Did you ever know him to cut himself in shaving before?",
  "59667": "If you are to blush to hear of such things now you are an old married woman, when are you not to blush to hear of them?",
  "59668": "What shall you do after tonight?",
  "59669": "How came you to see her?",
  "59670": "Can he endure no noise, and will venture on a wife?",
  "59671": "Why enlist?",
  "59672": "What did they talk about?",
  "59673": "But, so far as you can ascertain, he did not take it?",
  "59674": "Or should we perhaps go to him?",
  "59675": "Who is in the room besides you?",
  "59676": "What about him?",
  "59677": "Why are you standing up?",
  "59678": "Going to the raffle as well as ourselves?",
  "59679": "I wonder, is it not too late to administer unction?",
  "59680": "If we possess this force and our allies or partners do not, how do we fight together?",
  "59681": "Are the rules the same?",
  "59682": "And how many sheep?",
  "59683": "The surprise?",
  "59684": "Is my lord dead?",
  "59685": "You know her, it seems?",
  "59686": "Of WHAT?",
  "59687": "My enemy, say you?",
  "59688": "Who made them enemies?",
  "59689": "Why work on an old wound?",
  "59690": "So you mean to strap them instead?",
  "59691": "What on earth does she mean?",
  "59692": "If you are suspected, you shall give the alarm?",
  "59693": "How are you going to keep the game up?",
  "59694": "Why will the seamen always become morbid when possible?",
  "59695": "Do you know him, ma'am?",
  "59696": "Do you want to go anywhere?",
  "59697": "Well, a great deal must have soaked through, must it not?",
  "59698": "Is that the sort of thing you tell them at your hospital?",
  "59699": "Who knows whether the sun is not a blind man?",
  "59700": "Now what is decay?",
  "59701": "What advantage should I have over you, if knowing your secret I were to tell you mine?",
  "59702": "What were you trying to do with all your signs?",
  "59703": "Are we to take him up to her?",
  "59704": "What will she do?",
  "59705": "What do you talk so for?",
  "59706": "That who was here?",
  "59707": "Where could I get a drink?",
  "59708": "What do you mean by that?",
  "59709": "What shall we learn from THAT stuff?",
  "59710": "Is it nearly finished?",
  "59711": "And where is my wife?",
  "59712": "Well, then, you made the boating man believe that he was the father, did you not?",
  "59713": "If society is binding on the boat, is it also binding on the provisions?",
  "59714": "But tell me, do you think I am so beautiful?",
  "59715": "What finer retinue could be expected for his funeral?",
  "59716": "And is it not the very diagnostic of true salvation that it shall overcome the fear of death?",
  "59717": "You do not mean to ride, gentlemen?",
  "59718": "May I mention something?",
  "59719": "You understand how those things are managed?",
  "59720": "But what would become of this human imago in a state of perfect bliss?",
  "59721": "What are all systems, religious, political, or scientific, but opinions resting on evidence more or less satisfactory?",
  "59722": "Perhaps that you're searching far too much?",
  "59723": "And do you know whither he went?",
  "59724": "Did some marine monster come from time to time, to breathe at the bottom of this well?",
  "59725": "Then, of course, you can read and write quite correctly?",
  "59726": "Have we any of us any friends there?",
  "59727": "Then I shall be of no use to your majesty?",
  "59728": "When men are sore with the sense of oppressions, and menaced with the prospects of new ones, is the calmness of philosophy or the palsy of insensibility to be looked for?",
  "59729": "What did I care about paradise?",
  "59730": "And now how was I to proceed to reconstruct this midnight drama?",
  "59731": "It is, is it, sir?",
  "59732": "Shall we try to catch it?",
  "59733": "Ah, could I then think that it is in that second nature that the soul is ordained to seek its trials, and that the elements of human virtue find their harmonious place?",
  "59734": "Where could she find it?",
  "59735": "Well, what have you proved?",
  "59736": "This way, or that way?",
  "59737": "How did he strike you, prince?",
  "59738": "Bounderby?",
  "59739": "But, it will be said, is this all that pure reason can effect, in opening up prospects beyond the limits of experience?",
  "59740": "Why cannot man be content to live alone and be happy, and let the women live alone and be happy too?",
  "59741": "Can equality, by the right of succession, be preserved between citizens, as well as between cousins and brothers?",
  "59742": "Ay, and ashamed of it too?",
  "59743": "Cadby's death was from drowning, you say?",
  "59744": "Where's this young lady I've been hearing such a lot about?",
  "59745": "And how did it happen?",
  "59746": "And you?",
  "59747": "Do you think they are dead?",
  "59748": "Has it ever been done before?",
  "59749": "Who's that boy?",
  "59750": "Or do you know some reason why it suits your father's book to amalgamate as well as it suits mine?",
  "59751": "Had you not better light a candle?",
  "59752": "Do you know where he lives?",
  "59753": "What did that mean, to kiss?",
  "59754": "And how was she to punish her?",
  "59755": "Tyler appointed him?",
  "59756": "Had the nervous strain resulted in a hallucination, or did the door really move?",
  "59757": "Could she not be brought for just one little instant?",
  "59758": "Can you see me?",
  "59759": "Then to put the question is to solve the problem?",
  "59760": "Can you row up?",
  "59761": "Holding up a bank?",
  "59762": "To meet you in this way, on the sly?",
  "59763": "And what's a sonne?",
  "59764": "What am I to say to him?",
  "59765": "And in the first place, he will honour studies which impress these qualities on his soul and disregard others?",
  "59766": "Would I come and look at it?",
  "59767": "Did you remark the postmarks of those letters?",
  "59768": "Do you see what I meant about the clothes falling off?",
  "59769": "Where is your escort?",
  "59770": "Is it necessary, pray, to illustrate a remark in so practical a style?",
  "59771": "Would he go and describe his rough reception, or recount his exploit?",
  "59772": "What, in the name of everything hideous, did this mean?",
  "59773": "Are you going somewhere?",
  "59774": "Do you know her?",
  "59775": "What can have happened?",
  "59776": "I presume you know, gentlemen, to whom my friend is indebted for this piece of patronage?",
  "59777": "Why are you distressed?",
  "59778": "Are you going to have lunch too?",
  "59779": "And what is the means?",
  "59780": "And if I did know them now, what would it avail me?",
  "59781": "What would you have?",
  "59782": "Revels?",
  "59783": "Now will you believe I'm in earnest?",
  "59784": "Is the sun up?",
  "59785": "Oh, what's that?",
  "59786": "Is it the immediate object of this confidence, that you may at once ascertain that, with my knowledge?",
  "59787": "How large was it?",
  "59788": "Then had I not best send him about his business?",
  "59789": "What does it matter?",
  "59790": "Shall we invite him into our hearts?",
  "59791": "What have you done with her, then, if you have her no longer?",
  "59792": "Then you'll not be wanting me any more tonight, ma'am?",
  "59793": "Jane, do you hear that nightingale singing in the wood?",
  "59794": "Where could they be going?",
  "59795": "Not in regular government pay and employment, to lay traps?",
  "59796": "But who could affirm, who would dare to say, that the amiable fellow did not really see that which his two companions would not see?",
  "59797": "What was it that she wanted of him?",
  "59798": "Where are the nearest?",
  "59799": "How has he drawn you to himself?",
  "59800": "Not even of sending me a scrap of stuff for a new dress?",
  "59801": "If he cuts off one of his own toes, or one of his assistants', would you be very much astonished?",
  "59802": "Was the weather hot or cold?",
  "59803": "Where was my baggage?",
  "59804": "Authority?",
  "59805": "Tell him or not tell him?",
  "59806": "O you will let me hold your brave hand, stranger?",
  "59807": "You think so, my lord?",
  "59808": "In your left ear?",
  "59809": "Who shall live up to the great trust?",
  "59810": "Are we there already?",
  "59811": "And my council dares to temper and negotiate?",
  "59812": "How are you?",
  "59813": "But what?",
  "59814": "It was you, was it not?",
  "59815": "Am I not by?",
  "59816": "Have you given up loving her altogether?",
  "59817": "What good does it do?",
  "59818": "You have never heard her nephew play?",
  "59819": "What sin, mademoiselle?",
  "59820": "Or that it is impossible to draw more than one right line betwixt any two points?",
  "59821": "Do you think I could ever skip like that?",
  "59822": "Can you send me to the station?",
  "59823": "When did you leave service?",
  "59824": "Well, what do you think of that?",
  "59825": "What DO you know of him?",
  "59826": "What good will he be to the tribe?",
  "59827": "What, did you come digging here entirely because of me?",
  "59828": "Do you feel that you have lost her?",
  "59829": "What, senor?",
  "59830": "Or the raspberry?",
  "59831": "What is there?",
  "59832": "What have you been after?",
  "59833": "But who are all these?",
  "59834": "Oh, I?",
  "59835": "You here again?",
  "59836": "You have no trouble, I hope, to keep you waking?",
  "59837": "What is, or was, their address?",
  "59838": "But of what disease, then, did she die?",
  "59839": "Trodden upon by whom?",
  "59840": "Mighty men?",
  "59841": "No, but what do you mean?",
  "59842": "Yes, I am out of temper, and do you know why?",
  "59843": "Did you ever hear anything like your brother's eloquence?",
  "59844": "And what is the use of a fellow having a little money if it does not make him independent?",
  "59845": "Why have you no pride?",
  "59846": "Who are you, that you are to play with two young people's affections and break their hearts at your will?",
  "59847": "Yes?",
  "59848": "You mean, will it be prudent?",
  "59849": "What is justice?",
  "59850": "How so?",
  "59851": "What's in it?",
  "59852": "Did he himself find no cause for laughter on the earth?",
  "59853": "And who completed it as it now is?"
