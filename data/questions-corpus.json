  "1512": "You understan', do you?",
  "1513": "Where did you find so many diamonds?",
  "1514": "But tell me, senor, what do you call this excellent and rare adventure that has left us as we are left now?",

  "1516": "Are you not nearly spent with the heat?",
  "1517": "Do you think you are where you used to be?",
  "1518": "Then the eleventh day must have been a holiday?",
  "1519": "But what can you expect of a creature from the deanery?",
  "1520": "The children?",
  "1521": "You are, doubtless, acquainted with a variety of languages, so as to have been able to read all these?",
  "1522": "What makes you think that?",
  "1523": "You mean his idea for his native place?",
  "1524": "Why then are we to believe the same thing of another girl whom we never saw, told by nobody knows who, nor when, nor where?",
  "1525": "Were they going to let him alone this time?",
  "1526": "Had you commissioned me?",
  "1527": "What has the change been?",
  "1528": "I say, won't you come to the studio and have a talk?",
  "1529": "And where is the next point?",
  "1530": "It is not such a very dreadful circumstance that we are odd people, is it?",
  "1531": "What says my nephew?",
  "1532": "Who's firing?",
  "1533": "Mamma, are you cross?",
  "1534": "Perhaps you think the poor might have their part?",
  "1535": "Then I am to blow my brains out?",
  "1536": "What is it then, for goodness' sake?",
  "1537": "Poison him?",
  "1538": "And do you hear?",
  "1539": "Why didn't you come and wake me?",
  "1540": "What shall we do?",
  "1541": "Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?",
  "1542": "What's this paper?",
  "1543": "Then it was to go to her that you left us?",
  "1544": "Are we not endowed with inner force to fight successfully against obstacles and difficulties, and to wrest trophies of glory from hardships?",
  "1545": "Then I am condemned, sire?",
  "1546": "Could he be trying to measure the thickness of the crust of the earth that lay between us and the world above?",
  "1547": "What do you mean to do about this you have seen?",
  "1548": "But your old friends of the musketeers?",
  "1549": "How to get rid of him?",
  "1550": "Go and call upon this girl?",
  "1551": "Till he yield to me?",
  "1552": "You're back from leave, I suppose?",
  "1553": "Where are the papers of this prisoner?",
  "1554": "I say, friends, have you heard?",
  "1555": "Well, I said, and how does the change from oligarchy into democracy arise?",
  "1556": "Will you let them come?",
  "1557": "Wot d'ye mean?",
  "1558": "I mean that are not there now?",
  "1559": "Why have they not got rid of him?",
  "1560": "And will you tell me what a gentleman is?",

  "1562": "Does a woman ever know how much such speeches cost?",
  "1563": "How is this seeming miracle accomplished?",
  "1564": "Do you not humble me if you are too proud to accept what is due to you from my brother?",
  "1565": "Did you have a nice walk?",
  "1566": "What have you got to say for yourself, you withered old fence, eh?",
  "1567": "Whence came it?",
  "1568": "Would it not be more like a man to go before his face, and take the satisfaction of a warrior?",
  "1569": "How much does the hire amount to since yesterday?",
  "1570": "Have you heard the password?",
  "1571": "But where are the huts?",
  "1572": "What would be the use?",
  "1573": "But how did she become so?",
  "1574": "As before?",
  "1575": "But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge?",
  "1576": "How can it be foreign?",
  "1577": "Which of your uncles do you like best?",
  "1578": "And what is it to be?",
  "1579": "That we may find it necessary to punish the injury you have done to us?",
  "1580": "Ex tempore?",
  "1581": "Their father is dead?",
  "1582": "Or what is gone with my lords your brethren?",
  "1583": "Well, then, how about the land?",
  "1584": "What business have you at all with these interviews?",
  "1585": "How long was she there?",
  "1586": "A whole bottle?",
  "1587": "Moved?",
  "1588": "Is he not a man of honour and feeling?",
  "1589": "For if we fail in this our fight he must surely win, and then where end we?",
  "1590": "The great question certainly was, what?",
  "1591": "He supposed he was right?",
  "1592": "Is nothing due to the man whom we have all such reason to love, and no reason in the world to think ill of?",
  "1593": "But when you are not sure whether it is a fact or not, what are you to do?",
  "1594": "Would you like to see 'em?",
  "1595": "Which of the two?",
  "1596": "Has either of them confided anything to you by word of mouth?",
  "1597": "Has he ploughed, sowed, reaped, mowed, winnowed, weeded?",
  "1598": "Opposite the scaffold?",
  "1599": "An hundred crowns?",
  "1600": "Has anyone gone for the opossum?",
  "1601": "Apiece?",
  "1602": "Eyes don't trouble you any more, do they?",
  "1603": "Monseigneur assures me that the devil has nothing to do with this?",
  "1604": "Well, is it not noble to defend the poets, and introduce to the public all the new scientific and political ideas?",
  "1605": "Is this just?",
  "1606": "But how can you get there?",
  "1607": "Would you help me?",
  "1608": "What of the race, my pulse?",
  "1609": "What right had they to weep over or to talk about her?",
  "1610": "What's he like, this lad?",
  "1611": "What do you think, can a man be suffocated with a wet cloth?",
  "1612": "Is the loin pork enough?",
  "1613": "Put it straight, will you?",
  "1614": "Are you not, comrade?",
  "1615": "How is that, my child?",
  "1616": "And what after that?",
  "1617": "Do you repent of your sins, and do you acknowledge death as a righteous expiation and punishment?",
  "1618": "Shall I serve my child by a lie?",
  "1619": "Hey, who's there?",
  "1620": "How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments?",
  "1621": "Is not death opposed to life?",
  "1622": "And how much will that pair of stockings be worth when she has finished them?",
  "1623": "Grimaud, why did you not tell me this?",
  "1624": "My superintendent would not find me any money?",
  "1625": "How came it yours?",
  "1626": "Besides, who is to choose the velvet and cut for this young dandy?",
  "1627": "And, I say, don't you think you'd better suggest at the same time that the men should smoke?",
  "1628": "Who wants a protector?",
  "1629": "ARE they memorials?",
  "1630": "Exactly of what else could a platform consist?",
  "1631": "Why are you making knots in that ribbon, and writing invisible characters on the floor with the point of that busy little foot?",
  "1632": "Of my own life?",
  "1633": "What do these sounds portend?",
  "1634": "And who knows it?",
  "1635": "Can you do it?",
  "1636": "Or are you going to keep it right alongside of us outrageous fellows?",
  "1637": "You consider that to be important?",
  "1638": "Should I?",
  "1639": "Has he, ma'am?",
  "1640": "What precaution?",
  "1641": "On his track?",
  "1642": "Was not he disguised?",
  "1643": "And the quilting of the stairs no where worn out, and bare?",
  "1644": "Won't you listen?",

  "1646": "You go back and watch that long, will you?",
  "1647": "Will they abandon them in misfortune?",
  "1648": "What, then, will you say?",
  "1649": "That don't seem very far out of the way now, do it?",
  "1650": "Why, is it hid all around?",
  "1651": "You think love is the ticket, do you?",
  "1652": "Old or young?",
  "1653": "Has no copy been taken?",
  "1654": "Do you love him, love him with all your heart and soul, with all the love your bosom can feel?",
  "1655": "And how do you feel about it?",
  "1656": "What are fireworks like?",
  "1657": "Whom am I and what am I?",
  "1658": "Oh, why had she sent her letter?",
  "1659": "Do you conceive me, gentlemen?",
  "1660": "To what, ma'am?",
  "1661": "But how much truth was behind it?",
  "1662": "Ought we ever after to be considered as a part of the human race?",
  "1663": "What does it contain?",
  "1664": "Why should it break three inches from the top, as this one has done?",
  "1665": "Was it last evening that you came on board this vessel?",
  "1666": "Well, that wasn't very far, was it?",
  "1667": "And why not a bowl of rack punch as well as any other cause?",
  "1668": "Would it be some young man or other whom she takes an interest in?",
  "1669": "Is it absolutely necessary to go on with the letter, darling?",
  "1670": "Is that a genuine letter you are reading?",
  "1671": "What could be better?",
  "1672": "What has she been telling you?",
  "1673": "Why is that little, and the little freedom they enjoy, to be infringed?",
  "1674": "Had I been remanded to my dungeon, to await the next sacrifice, which would not take place for many months?",
  "1675": "Will she recover?",
  "1676": "And so you like this man's sisters, too, do you?",
  "1677": "Is that what you mean?",
  "1678": "What do you mean by going with other men, anyway?",
  "1679": "Where's the lecture room, d'you know?",
  "1680": "Why didn't you tell me, then?",
  "1681": "What would be the end?",
  "1682": "Feelin' sick?",
  "1683": "Determine on what?",
  "1684": "And yet what?",
  "1685": "Why risk the world's great empire for a punk?",
  "1686": "You mean, spend too much money?",
  "1687": "Shall, then, this bow take the life of many a chief among us, merely because you cannot bend it yourself?",
  "1688": "Nose and all?",
  "1689": "You desired a confessor?",
  "1690": "And will you answer it?",
  "1691": "How, then, will competition be harmoniously determined in society?",
  "1692": "Have I got to drink that stuff?",
  "1693": "Ruined her?",
  "1694": "So that I need not make use of this petition?",
  "1695": "But what do you conclude from that, father?",
  "1696": "What took place?",
  "1697": "Will you give your honour not to fire while we talk?",
  "1698": "What's the use of that?",
  "1699": "What's fame?",
  "1700": "Where would be the use of it?",
  "1701": "My purpose, for why should I deny it?",

  "1703": "What makes you so smitten with that little vermin?",
  "1704": "But how did you get in here?",
  "1705": "He had a son with him, hadn't he?",
  "1706": "Where was the man flying to after such dreadful retaliation?",
  "1707": "Why not still proceed over the untamed yet obedient element?",
  "1708": "Why then has he never taken part in public affairs?",
  "1709": "From that woman?",
  "1710": "Does not every merchant have his secret mark?",
  "1711": "And that others should approve of what we approve, is no miracle or impossibility?",
  "1712": "He will be a baronet, will he not?",
  "1713": "To what purpose?",
  "1714": "And was he a black man?",
  "1715": "Can you pray?",
  "1716": "And can his majesty count upon many such subjects as yourself for his flight?",
  "1717": "What became of him?",
  "1718": "How many arms have you there ready for distribution?",
  "1719": "Will you come and see me?",
  "1720": "What makes you suppose I know?",
  "1721": "But what am I to do with the brute?",
  "1722": "What nonsense is this?",
  "1723": "Where was she now?",
  "1724": "Can't you find the cake?",
  "1725": "How do you explain the influence the count evidently possessed over those ruffians?",
  "1726": "What is the idea of you buying a fox skin, you poor beggar?",
  "1727": "Lost confidence?",
  "1728": "How could he have chosen a better friend in whom to trust?",
  "1729": "And did it believe, then, it had positively caught the redoubtable colonel?",
  "1730": "In the same way?",
  "1731": "What was your remark, my dear friend?",
  "1732": "Why do you answer me so roughly?",
  "1733": "What's going to become of us now?",
  "1734": "And what will the be the good of your going on after that?",
  "1735": "Is it right?",
  "1736": "Be terrorized by every prating paper?",
  "1737": "Are many of the young ladies with you?",
  "1738": "Oh, she thinks me too meek?",
  "1739": "Sparking plugs, eh?",
  "1740": "Was he alone, that long night, whose brave, loving spirit was bearing up, in that old shed, against buffeting and brutal stripes?",

  "2166": "How can it be possible to love amid lies and treason?",
  "2167": "D'you know that you haven't kissed me once since I came here?",
  "2168": "The size of the projectile, the length of the cannon being settled, what would be the quantity of powder necessary to produce impulsion?",
  "2169": "You didn't know it?",
  "2170": "What answer do you make?",
  "2171": "Why haven't you been in then?",
  "2172": "Who is your folks?",
  "2173": "Will you give me your opinion of it?",
  "2174": "Oh, was he?",
  "2175": "No guarantee?",
  "2176": "What little imp is this?",
  "2177": "Who would use money and position better than he meant to use them?",
  "2178": "Run after it?",
  "2179": "Whose dog is it?",
  "2180": "And then, are you really acting according to your conscience, or are you acting in order to be admired of men?",
  "2181": "They had the sun to go by, certainly, when they started, but who could say how long it would last?",
  "2182": "Why ask us to do what you will not do yourselves?",
  "2183": "From companions in peril, would they not again be avowed rivals?",
  "2184": "Would you let me play your part for one night?",
  "2185": "And would he try to go beyond just action?",
  "2186": "Did you ever see such a handsome, strapping girl?",
  "2187": "What else have we been talking about?",
  "2188": "From where have you got them all?",
  "2189": "Who is the man?",
  "2190": "Who I, sir?",
  "2191": "Is it right to do men to death like this?",
  "2192": "Have ye shipped in her?",
  "2193": "It's a woman?",
  "2194": "Is its pattern strange to you?",
  "2195": "Your stepfather saved her?",
  "2196": "Can you help me find my way?",
  "2197": "Sir, said I, I hope you won't be angry, but, saving yourself, do you think they are painted worse than they deserve?",
  "2198": "Is not that verily a sanctifying of his holy name?",
  "2199": "And how about them?",
  "2200": "Nor exactly a bird?",
  "2201": "How am I mistaken in her?",
  "2202": "Did you marry three wives maybe?",
  "2203": "Do you wish me to give it up?",
  "2204": "Which is it you wish to hear?",
  "2205": "What talk is this of choosing?",
  "2206": "How shall I rhyme in this eternal roar?",
  "2207": "Any men that came along?",
  "2208": "Why not open my mind's eye for me?",
  "2209": "And whence did we obtain our knowledge?",
  "2210": "And pray what sort of guardians do you make?",
  "2211": "Never there?",
  "2212": "Do you see what I see?",
  "2213": "Or when he roasted it?",
  "2214": "What need that we should insults interchange?",
  "2215": "They don't look grave and mysterious, as if they had heard something strange?",
  "2216": "Why have you that silk frock on, then?",
  "2217": "Do you think about it?",
  "2218": "Isn't it so, lads?",
  "2219": "But suppose the wind were to sweep it off, so that he couldn't come back toward us?",
  "2220": "Who is it that calls?",
  "2221": "How could she do less for him than he was so anxious to do for her?",
  "2222": "No doubt he was in a pitiable position, but how could that be helped?",
  "2223": "You mean you really don't know?",
  "2224": "Have you not received any?",
  "2225": "What is changed?",
  "2226": "Why not be bestial, and go the whole round of experience?",
  "2227": "Have I upset you?",
  "2228": "How had she known that he it was, that is, that it was he?",
  "2229": "Did she fancy that he had meant to attack her with it?",
  "2230": "You remember, I said, how the rulers were chosen before?",
  "2231": "Do you think there is no weaker brother among all our lodges that could not be bought?",
  "2232": "And kill them?",
  "2233": "To fairs, markets, races, and so forth, I suppose?",
  "2234": "Why are YOU tramping?",
  "2235": "Am I to proceed in my work?",
  "2236": "Graduating well, you mean?",
  "2237": "Why is it that we hesitate?",
  "2238": "Or have you not begun to think about it yet?",
  "2239": "Surely by this time you ought to be able to understand something?",
  "2240": "Who are YOU in this establishment?",
  "2241": "Would not any decent soldier smite him across the face instead of grasping him by the hand?",
  "2242": "Lonely, like the devil, and envious like him?",
  "2243": "But how came he to have so singular a companion?",
  "2244": "Do I understand that he asked for more, after he had eaten the supper allotted by the dietary?",
  "2245": "Had he said anything to give himself away?",
  "2246": "Were they possibly the earth beating time?",
  "2247": "Was he poking fun, or not?",
  "2248": "What's the matter with this fellow?",
  "2249": "Sikes is not, I suppose?",
  "2250": "Why should I tell you what you cannot alter?",
  "2251": "Shall I go to her?",
  "2252": "Is he not, duke?",
  "2253": "And how old were you at that time?",
  "2254": "Why should we not all go?",
  "2255": "I ask what this pretended revolution has revolutionized?",
  "2256": "Do you suppose they keep vodka for sale?",
  "2257": "For how long a time?",
  "2258": "He could be neither of these things, for he had never heard of them, but do you think he is to be pitied for that?",
  "2259": "What makes you think so?",
  "2260": "I do not know, and what if I did?",
  "2261": "What is soon done, sir?",
  "2262": "Is that what you're waiting about for?",
  "2263": "How came ye to talk about that?",
  "2264": "There is a certain formidable machine, have you seen it?",
  "2265": "You hear, D'Artagnan?",
  "2266": "In other words, what are the most salient episodes and the most remarkable phases of the war between labor and capital?",
  "2267": "Ah, really?",
  "2268": "It would be a grand thing for one of those girls, wouldn't it?",
  "2269": "But how is it that you do these things?",
  "2270": "What is it about your pay?",
  "2271": "Had I not recognised that day, for the hundredth time, what I was worth?",
  "2272": "And you don't think me as handsome as your grandfather?",
  "2273": "Was this another hallucination?",
  "2274": "But, tell me, you have no one else staying here, have you?",
  "2275": "Do they display their charms merely to amuse them?",
  "2276": "Shall we use these, and so be even as to weapons?",
  "2277": "And why should you expect me to take you out riding?",
  "2278": "And what is it done in?",
  "2279": "What, then, are the conditions, the LAWS, of human society?",
  "2280": "Why not, indeed, seeing that at least it would have brought comfort to the poor people of this place?",
  "2281": "It was your play, I believe?",
  "2282": "Yes, monsieur, but once more, to what purpose are all these questions?",
  "2283": "And why now, my pretty simplicity?",
  "2284": "Besides, who knows?",
  "2285": "Why can't people take a line and stick to it?",
  "2286": "Which means, I suppose, that you refuse the service which I asked of you?",
  "2287": "Anything wrong?",
  "2288": "I suppose he can wait below?",
  "2289": "I suppose you have heard what's been happening to the beauty on the hill?",
  "2290": "Whose is that light which makes the eye to see perfectly and the visible to appear?",
  "2291": "The boys weep, and do you not think it is right that a father should weep?",
  "2292": "And what would he have done, the loafer, tell me, what would he have done?",
  "2293": "And what is doing?",
  "2294": "Is there a flood?",
  "2295": "How far had he walked?",
  "2296": "Your second brother?",
  "2297": "Because every one who may have anything to tell, you hold, will have been so squared?",
  "2298": "What was the use of sending for him?",
  "2299": "And where does he come from?",
  "2300": "What is it, duke?",
  "2301": "Pythangelus?",
  "2302": "I was going to ask, mama, before you were married, had you many suitors?",
  "2303": "Why should you hate the moon?",
  "2304": "Do you know the chapel?",
  "2305": "Who IS it?",
  "2306": "Where are all the eyes that heretofore watched me?",
  "2307": "Know you not, then, that your life is my life, and your death my death?",
  "2308": "Have you relatives?",
  "2309": "She may be free?",
  "2310": "Where is their road?",
  "2311": "Why not attack at once?",
  "2312": "What is allowed, then?",
  "2313": "Is she kind as she is fair?",
  "2314": "But where could such a hound lie concealed, where did it get its food, where did it come from, how was it that no one saw it by day?",
  "2315": "Have we made an erroneous interpretation of the document?",
  "2316": "Let me go on your bob?",
  "2317": "And what if I think to kill you now?",
  "2318": "And you will tell me this secret?",
  "2319": "Because we loved, and dared to say so, and even boasted of it?",
  "2320": "Is this body destined for such work?",
  "2321": "Your majesty is joking, have you not a million?",
  "2322": "Is there nothing you could take to give you present relief?",
  "2323": "Ought you to feel discouraged?",
  "2324": "To be sure, he who never liveth at the right time, how could he ever die at the right time?",
  "2325": "What will become of her now?",
  "2326": "What are you coming for?",
  "2327": "What's pretence?",
  "2328": "Hadn't I better play something?",
  "2329": "And why did you wish to see me?",
  "2330": "Call?",
  "2331": "Was it possible that we were on our way down through the mountains again?",
  "2332": "Well, what DO you know of him?",
  "2333": "A woman or an ape?",
  "2334": "Day?",
  "2335": "Who said I would not go?",
  "2336": "What was that?",
  "2337": "How is it he leaves me alone in my misery?",
  "2338": "What is the use of preserving slang?",
  "2339": "But what have I done to inspire you with such a feeling of thankfulness?",
  "2340": "You have, then, fulfilled my command, and composed a new interlude?",
  "2341": "The mysterious speaker?",
  "2342": "And how should I be able to recognize, and know, and designate by name what is strange to me, and what I have never before felt?",
  "2343": "No divisions?",
  "2344": "You don't mean you are coming with us?",
  "2345": "For your marriage?",
  "2346": "Did they want to kill you?",
  "2347": "Am I in the right?",
  "2348": "Brickmakers, eh?",
  "2349": "Well, what does it all mean?",
  "2350": "To anybody?",
  "2351": "What do you hope, then?",
  "2352": "Well, would you mind my reforming myself this afternoon?",
  "2353": "Then you know me?",
  "2354": "What about meals?",
  "2355": "ART SICK?",
  "2356": "And what did he do?",
  "2357": "And her brother?",
  "2358": "You have heerd tell of cotton rags dipt in turpentine, hav'nt you, how they produce combustion?",
  "2359": "But what appeal could it be?",
  "2360": "Wrong?",
  "2361": "Do you want me to tell everything?",
  "2362": "Rob suggested?",
  "2363": "And is the soul in agreement with the affections of the body?",
  "2364": "Would you like this room, sir?",
  "2365": "What do I hear?",
  "2366": "Shall I stop the boat and try to get you out here?",
  "2367": "And are you prepared to meet the cost?",
  "2368": "You?",
  "2369": "Markova?",
  "2370": "You haven't any place to go, have you?",
  "2371": "What is there for us?",
  "2372": "Besides, shall we not bear the lords of the habitable earth to be lords over us, and yet bear tyrants of our own country?",
  "2373": "When, and in what month?",
  "2374": "But what are we to do with him?",
  "2375": "Why can you not bear them?",
  "2376": "I wonder if all the things move along with us?",
  "2377": "Why this negation, if a modification was sufficient?",
  "2378": "Was this idolized parent still in existence?",
  "2379": "Who follows me?",
  "2380": "But how in the name of all that's wonderful does he GET OUT?",
  "2381": "Could the professor throw any light upon that?",
  "2382": "Can't we be good friends?",
  "2383": "Could it be possible that the sense of unreality in which he felt himself imprisoned had communicated itself to his wife?",
  "2384": "Why alas?",
  "2385": "What do you mean by that, monsieur?",
  "2386": "After having met with so many who promised, when shall I find one who will give?",
  "2387": "What the deuce are you talking about?",
  "2388": "Coffins, where?",
  "2389": "You are not in debt, then?",
  "2390": "Why should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice of the people?",
  "2391": "I love you, I?",
  "2392": "Surely there is no necessity for you to say one word, mama?",
  "2393": "That's eight months she has been away, surely?",
  "2394": "Who shall go in?",
  "2395": "Will you sell them for five francs?",
  "2396": "Why negotiate, and above all why retreat, when to retreat is so contrary to his method of conducting war?",
  "2397": "You wanted to speak to her?",
  "2398": "But am I not your nearest relative?",
  "2399": "Then what do you think, mother, has become of 'em?",
  "2400": "You have written to your father?",
  "2401": "Ought it not?",
  "2402": "Did he tell you so himself?",
  "2403": "The ladies are great observers, sir?",
  "2404": "Are you come to do anything in my way, sir?",
  "2405": "Have you honours?",
  "2406": "I may marry somebody when I grow up but I'm far too young to be thinking of it yet, don't you think, teacher?",
  "2407": "Suppose, now, I could give you up to a rich man who would be able to insure you against all wants?",
  "2408": "If so, why is it not among his papers?",
  "2409": "What's your name, portress?",
  "2410": "How big is this hole?",
  "2411": "Jest t' pull me along outer th' road?",
  "2412": "Hear you how they are sawing and hammering there below?",
  "2413": "Don't ye love sperm?",
  "2414": "Now what say you to aluminum, gentlemen?",
  "2415": "How much am I worth?",
  "2416": "And the cards I ordered to be engraved as soon as you knew the number of the house?",
  "2417": "What put that in your head?",
  "2418": "Had she never looked for the door?",
  "2419": "Everything?",
  "2420": "Do you think he will object to it?",
  "2421": "What think you of such a song as this?",
  "2422": "Have they not heard that of their colonel?",
  "2423": "Who was the gentleman?",
  "2424": "How could he have me in view, and not be aware of it himself?",
  "2425": "What is your name?",
  "2426": "How did I take to it?",
  "2427": "And she is getting on well, you say?",
  "2428": "Have you anything to ask, sire, before we part?",
  "2429": "Are you mad?",
  "2430": "And what does it mean?",
  "2431": "Now, then, who are you?",
  "2432": "Why do I wish to unite you two?",
  "2433": "Do I look like a sweep, then?",
  "2434": "Why, how fail to understand?",
  "2435": "You understand me?",
  "2436": "Brownlow, I believe, sir?",
  "2437": "Why have I always to complain of you?",
  "2438": "But you killed nobody yourselves?",
  "2439": "Why do you pity them?",
  "2440": "Yes, but could not the mistake be rectified?",
  "2441": "What is the matter, said he, my chicken?",
  "2442": "Am I not to know to whom to present it?",
  "2443": "I say, madam, what do you propose to do with these papers?",
  "2444": "Yes, d'you want anything?",
  "2445": "Are we ready?",
  "2446": "Have you any better explanation?",
  "2447": "Who was it gave me that rogues' march from the stocks to the gallows's foot?",
  "2448": "Why, pray?",
  "2449": "Now could I speak of that which is not yet?",
  "2450": "What is the proprietor?",
  "2451": "Would you mind stepping in for a moment?",
  "2452": "Shall I say yes or shall I say no?",
  "2453": "What should you be out of spirits for?",
  "2454": "Do you always want to be fooled?",
  "2455": "At this last moment I ask you, have we not long been betrothed to each other in our secret hearts?",
  "2456": "Ripping, isn't it?",
  "2457": "If you hadn't a been dogged, where'd you a been now?",
  "2458": "When did this happen?",
  "2459": "Something about somebody laughing at a locksmith?",
  "2460": "For what are you fighting?",
  "2461": "And that is adding insult to injury, is it?",
  "2462": "And where will I look for 'em?",
  "2463": "Or failed to do anything you ordered?",
  "2464": "Gentlemen, is that a true view of the case?",
  "2465": "It was with a hilted knife maybe?",
  "2466": "Was he really doing everything that could be expected of him?",
  "2467": "How fare ye?",
  "2468": "What noise was that?",
  "2469": "But will the person who shall accompany you afterward be a man or a woman?",
  "2470": "Yes, but how am I to give it up?",
  "2471": "We may depend on you?",
  "2472": "Does it really seem so to you?",
  "2473": "You've been tramping in the sun, and it's a very warm night, and hadn't you better sleep over the notion?",
  "2474": "And you really live by the river?",
  "2475": "Shall not the grief of the old time follow?",
  "2476": "Couldn't you manage to hold me in your arms?",
  "2477": "Isn't he very rich?",
  "2478": "Some authentic relic?",
  "2479": "Why are you not at work?",
  "2480": "Why did I suddenly loose my grip of her?",
  "2481": "Sure you did?",
  "2482": "Sylvestre?",
  "2483": "An't that as nat'ral as a sheep's bleating, or a pig's grunting, or a horse's neighing, or a bird's singing?",
  "2484": "Was it a kind of adoration for so much purity?",
  "2485": "It would have embarrassed what?",
  "2486": "Would you prefer a more humble life, a life more suited to your strength?",
  "2487": "What he?",
  "2488": "What did you suppose, then?",
  "2489": "Did we not finish it?",
  "2490": "Will you be mine?",
  "2491": "But, black or white, do they eat it raw, or cook it?",
  "2492": "He did not proceed to blows?",
  "2493": "What else had she herself meant three minutes before by speaking of her as great?",
  "2494": "Why has the legislator given hands to this conspiracy of monopolies, to this interdict upon theories belonging to all?",
  "2495": "And do you suppose it weighs on him any less than on you?",
  "2496": "Do you wish these proofs, these attestations, which I alone possess, to be destroyed?",
  "2497": "Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?",
  "2498": "You do not like?",
  "2499": "You are going to be married?",
  "2500": "And will you, sir, get your living by the counsel of traitors?",
  "2501": "Wot job?",
  "2502": "What happened in the house?",
  "2503": "Why do you not ask the fisherman for his cutlass?",
  "2504": "Have you forgotten, my lord, that it is he who answered for me to the queen?",
  "2505": "If harm befell him, what would be our fate?",
  "2506": "You mark me sir?",
  "2507": "And what would you yourself say?",
  "2508": "Do you think, gentlemen, that I look like an innkeeper?",
  "2509": "Did you ever see him?",
  "2510": "And yet you say he is not a medical student?",
  "2511": "Are there children or are there not?",
  "2512": "What is he?",
  "2513": "Where have they been put?",
  "2514": "How does my sweet lady?",
  "2515": "And what was his purpose?",
  "2516": "And now why will you ask us to deny the humanity of the slave, and estimate him as only the equal of the hog?",
  "2517": "Ah, you know it?",
  "2518": "Why don't they jump in and destroy these fliers?",
  "2519": "But with a beard, you tell me?",
  "2520": "But, on the other hand, whose blood was that which lay so thickly upon the floor?",
  "2521": "Well, what did you see, sir, or think you saw?",
  "2522": "What was taking place within him?",
  "2523": "You love me, don't you?",
  "2524": "What did you force me to run away with you for?",
  "2525": "Did I groan all right?",
  "2526": "Known what?",
  "2527": "You, my poor child, suffer poverty and hunger?",
  "2528": "Was it by his extensive knowledge, by his exquisite judgment, or by his heroic valour?",
  "2529": "Whose language would he speak?",
  "2530": "Yer powers wasn't enough to carry 'ee through?",
  "2531": "Perhaps you would care to try?",
  "2532": "Why should he change his name in a country where no one knew his original one?",
  "2533": "What can it know about the matter?",
  "2534": "Shall we begin education with music, and go on to gymnastic afterwards?",
  "2535": "Shall we try it?",
  "2536": "I hope I have not driven her away?",
  "2537": "Where does he come in?",
  "2538": "Why have you hatched these vipers which, when they shall have grown, will inflict injury on all, beginning with yourself?",
  "2539": "What have I seen?",
  "2540": "Am not I dreaming?",
  "2541": "Am I to say what you told me?",
  "2542": "What could be more just?",
  "2543": "How many shots?",
  "2544": "Why did he leave?",
  "2545": "Well, and what then?",
  "2546": "Do you pity him?",
  "2547": "To be cased up and hung by on the wall?",
  "2548": "Sword?",
  "2549": "You heard what I said to the prince?",
  "2550": "What's to be done?",
  "2551": "Are there any good men?",
  "2552": "Diminish public burdens, assess taxes on a more equitable basis?",
  "2553": "Who can deny that one's physical conditions determine one's character or personality?",
  "2554": "How am I to know?",
  "2555": "I have sent for three of my friends, but who knows whether they were at home?",
  "2556": "A qui cette voiture la?",
  "2557": "Or when he gathered it?",
  "2558": "I say, aren't we much too soon?",
  "2559": "Do you like it?",
  "2560": "And who is there that will either take the trouble or incur the odium, of a strict scrunity into the secret springs of the transaction?",
  "2561": "Are the other children in bed?",
  "2562": "Does he make it against that newspaper editor merely?",
  "2563": "Why torture me now?",
  "2564": "Abideth there husband for me, after the son of my uncle?",
  "2565": "Or have you dined?",
  "2566": "Cur aliquid vidi?",
  "2567": "Or, was he?",
  "2568": "Had you ever seen it before?",
  "2569": "Have I positive and substantive proof of what I assert?",
  "2570": "How could you let it go so?",
  "2571": "Why should I look at the letter?",
  "2572": "Won't you please be good enough to send my tea into the library?",
  "2573": "But how did it turn out with me?",

  "3663": "Shall you write to him?",
  "3664": "Aren't you ever going to finish that story and give me some of the profits?",
  "3665": "We are safe here, at last, eh?",
  "3666": "Tell me at once, why have you suddenly developed this 'profound respect,' eh?",
  "3667": "Then you are rich?",
  "3668": "You heard that?",
  "3669": "And why so?",
  "3670": "How could the king have fallen in love with her?",
  "3671": "What would that answer be?",
  "3672": "What did they think of the proposal?",
  "3673": "Was not that what ye said?",
  "3674": "Must I?",

  "5504": "You want to see who they are?",
  "5505": "She's not that old green launch with a yellow line, very broad in the beam?",
  "5506": "What stayed them?",
  "5507": "And I've got a tremendous will, have I?",
  "5508": "Wot about it?",
  "5509": "Oh, something in a philanthropic way?",
  "5510": "Oh, but how was it?",
  "5511": "But where are we drifting?",
  "5512": "But what were our managers doing?",
  "5513": "Weren't you?",
  "5514": "You are come to tell us it is time to be gone, have you not?",
  "5515": "Was the man a magician?",
  "5516": "Her brother?",
  "5517": "Do you not see what feigned prices, are set upon little stones and rarities?",
  "5518": "What, are there any greater still?",
  "5519": "Is she your cousin?",
  "5520": "What mystery could be hidden under this sign?",
  "5521": "To the cottage of her sister?",
  "5522": "A pipe ?",
  "5523": "Do I delight to die, or life desire?",
  "5524": "To use riches considered by me unlawful on the plea that they are inherited from my mother?",
  "5525": "Why are you in low spirits?",
  "5526": "Surely it will never, on the contrary, be suffered to degenerate from man to fiend?",
  "5527": "If she married and got rid of it, which was the best thing she could do, why don't you give her the benefit of the change?",
  "5528": "And you will leave me then?",
  "5529": "Was it an illusion, a mistake, an optical illusion?",
  "5530": "What principle of good faith, then, was violated?",
  "5531": "Ain't there no water, nor nothing to eat?",
  "5532": "Looking toward our house?",
  "5533": "Will you be quiet, then?",
  "5534": "Who am I?",
  "5535": "You couldn't really expect a person to pray very well the first time she tried, could you?",
  "5536": "Is it for you, who keep an inn, to treat passengers at this rate?",
  "5537": "And did you see him?",
  "5538": "Why don't you walk down?",

  "5575": "Am I boring you with all this?",
  "5576": "Are they, do you think?",
  "5577": "Do you realize that it's all your fault?",
  "5578": "My dear fellow, how are you?",
  "5579": "What does he appear to be?",
  "5580": "What were you doing?",
  "5581": "What is the relative age of this hymn?",
  "5582": "But if your honor knew this man?",
  "5583": "Do you think the lemon juice did any good?",
  "5584": "Am I to believe that?",
  "5585": "But your writing?",
  "5586": "Well, do you hear, sirrah?",
  "5587": "Was it in this room that you gave your instructions as to the copying of the document?",
  "5588": "How comes it that a true and cordial fraternity has not arrested on the one side and on the other the effects of pride and labor?",
  "5589": "What do you mean, sir?",
  "5590": "Do you wish this to live?",
  "5591": "What more can they pretend?",
  "5592": "Has anything escaped me?",

  "5598": "I ain't here for harm, young master, I suppose?",
  "5599": "In favour of the temperate men?",
  "5600": "Why not like that?",
  "5601": "Did you not hear me?",
  "5602": "Indeed, how can he, when they but follow his own vile example?",
  "5603": "Now, what must we conclude with respect to such sexual differences as these?",
  "5604": "You did not ask for particulars on any point which appeared to you to be crucial?",

  "5609": "Was it mere fancy?",
  "5610": "Were you not saying that he too makes, not the idea which, according to our view, is the essence of the bed, but only a particular bed?",
  "5611": "Why, what are they thinking upon, sir?",
  "5612": "Shall we go forward?",
  "5613": "I suppose you quite agree with them, prince?",
  "5614": "Am I not right?",
  "5615": "Did there exist in the as yet unexplored parts some accomplice ready to enter into communication with them?",
  "5616": "And after the police?",
  "5617": "Why did I say 'Je vous aime'* to her, which was a lie, and worse than a lie?",
  "5618": "Have you a place you would like to put him in?",
  "5619": "Well, then, how am I free?",
  "5620": "A mere drudge?",
  "5621": "And who put the torpedo there?",
  "5622": "This is the triumph I was to have, is it?",
  "5623": "What new conditions?",
  "5624": "Are we wrong?",
  "5625": "How can we help loving and dwelling upon its recollections?",
  "5626": "Do you not know him?",
  "5627": "My good sir, is this man a hero, or a criminal?",
  "5628": "You would not change your lot for that of a king?",
  "5629": "Well, you will not tell us?",
  "5630": "But why in the world shouldn't you see him, dear?",
  "5631": "She could hardly believe as much, but why did he not write?",
  "5632": "If so, state all he said, as nearly as you can?",
  "5633": "A race?",
  "5634": "Would you like to see him?",
  "5635": "And how are you?",
  "5636": "Why send it away?",
  "5637": "What's the hurry?",
  "5638": "How should you know that?",
  "5639": "Very handsome still?",
  "5640": "Would you like to see a little of it?",
  "5641": "May I presume to ask whether you have long possessed it?",
  "5642": "Well, waiving that, as she is nothing to me, and virtuously married to another man, why should she come troubling us?",
  "5643": "And what on earth are you going to do with it?",
  "5644": "Wouldn't you give them a week?",
  "5645": "Why so hard?",
  "5646": "Have they loved me?",
  "5647": "Ah, but you mean here, at your own home?",
  "5648": "How am I to get in?",
  "5649": "Then he who is a good keeper of anything is also a good thief?",
  "5650": "Will you ask him what kind was his son?",
  "5651": "Ey?",
  "5652": "The one in blue?",
  "5653": "Lordy, what did you do?",
  "5654": "So you'll not tell, will you?",
  "5655": "Why did he not bring it to me here?",
  "5656": "Do you mean to say a woman isn't beautiful after she is twenty?",
  "5657": "What is all that noise?",
  "5658": "Has he escaped?",
  "5659": "Have you got him?",
  "5660": "Has he a mother?",
  "5661": "Would he carry him on with him?",
  "5662": "Was the remainder of the coronet at all injured?",
  "5663": "You mean that you think there was no accident?",
  "5664": "Why, dear?",
  "5665": "How badly?",
  "5666": "Why should he not go to the home of his fathers?",
  "5667": "Is that all he does?",
  "5668": "Ah, where in the world have there been greater follies than with the pitiful?",
  "5669": "But what is the latest news of him?",
  "5670": "Don't you see that creature with a yellow thing in her turban, and a red satin gown, and a great watch?",
  "5671": "You know we want some help in the servant staff of the hospital?",
  "5672": "Of money?",
  "5673": "Who will plant the flag on the barricade again?",
  "5674": "Was the fire wholly extinct there?",
  "5675": "Why did you originally go away from me?",
  "5676": "But are not these spirited natures apt to be savage with one another, and with everybody else?",
  "5677": "How did this come about?",
  "5678": "What do I know about arms or supports?",
  "5679": "What does she make a sham for, and pretend to give me money, and take it away again?",
  "5680": "And was this conference arranged beforehand?",
  "5681": "Wherefore should I hold, good fellow?",
  "5682": "What have you done with your fur?",
  "5683": "Is not that true?",
  "5684": "And do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to her daughters, than to us?",
  "5685": "But why must I promise that?",
  "5686": "And what do you know?",
  "5687": "Will you have it so, or will you share your lover's punishment?",
  "5688": "And why on earth does she want to speak to me at all?",
  "5689": "What did you do it for?",
  "5690": "What can I do to serve you?",
  "5691": "What reason had you to strike the man who won my daughter?",
  "5692": "May it not be defined as a period of about twenty years in a woman's life, and thirty in a man's?",
  "5693": "What good is arguments to me?",
  "5694": "And who escapes his lot?",
  "5695": "How is she looking?",
  "5696": "Why so?",
  "5697": "Why is dawn red?",
  "5698": "What did he wish for?",
  "5699": "Would she take it as a joke?",
  "5700": "And is she not effectually degraded?",
  "5701": "Final for couples?",
  "5702": "They must be sold, I suppose?",
  "5703": "For what are these country squires compared to our wealthy merchants?",
  "5704": "But what shall I do?",
  "5705": "Who can tell what a dark, dreary, hopeless life I have dragged on for months past?",
  "5706": "What could be the trouble in that quarter?",
  "5707": "What does it matter, after all?",
  "5708": "What is the result of it?",
  "5709": "Did you hear that cry?",
  "5710": "Oh, don't you see?",
  "5711": "Did you ever see such a large peach in all your life?",
  "5712": "How much are you to give him?",
  "5713": "How many?",
  "5714": "Everything as it used to be?",
  "5715": "And how may that be?",
  "5716": "Are you comfortable?",
  "5717": "Can there be a rational adjustment of the claims of each?",
  "5718": "Father, that money is mine, why should I speak to you about that?",
  "5719": "Surely, sweet, it shall never be our dwelling?",
  "5720": "If he is it's not much good my coming, is it?",
  "5721": "Boys, an't this yer fun?",
  "5722": "Would those stiff trees that had outlived the eagle, turn young and airy pages to him, to skip on his errands when he bade them?",
  "5723": "What is their story?",
  "5724": "At what hour shall we come?",
  "5725": "Have you any tips to give us before we clear out?",
  "5726": "Which is the principal aim of these three?",
  "5727": "That's to you, I suppose, child?",
  "5728": "How must I arrange it, then?",
  "5729": "Is it really?",
  "5730": "Do you want any assistance?",
  "5731": "Yes, and is there a rope handy?",
  "5732": "Do you think it would be good for you?",
  "5733": "Suppose I handed you over to the police?",
  "5734": "And is the art of war one of those arts in which she can or can not share?",
  "5735": "And when did you arrive here?",
  "5736": "But how did he procure his books?",
  "5737": "You know her only son died eight years ago?",
  "5738": "How far do you purpose to extend your walk?",
  "5739": "At once?",
  "5740": "You do not like it, then?",
  "5741": "Shan't I disturb you?",
  "5742": "Non es eques, quare?",
  "5743": "Boys, ma'am?",
  "5744": "Wait a little, if you don't mind, and if you have time to spare?",
  "5745": "Has he asked you to give me the message?",
  "5746": "Some holy book, no doubt?",
  "5747": "Is it possible that one can forget and forsake what he once loved?",
  "5748": "Shall I put myself into the harness to be worn out like an old horse?",
  "5749": "You come from the contractor, you say?",
  "5750": "Why do you do it?",
  "5751": "Am I never to hear the last of this?",
  "5752": "You say that these thirteen millions are found to be wanting in the accounts?",
  "5753": "Then why not admit that these may be replaced some day by other moral intuitions to be evolved in an unknown future?",
  "5754": "What of yourself?",
  "5755": "Can't you now, doctor?",
  "5756": "Surely there must be someone among all of you here who will turn this shameless creature out of the room?",
  "5757": "What on earth is the use of time to a fellow who has twice as much of it as he knows what to do with?",
  "5758": "Or had he found something he wished to keep to himself?",
  "5759": "And how do these wiseacres know that man wants a normal, a virtuous choice?",
  "5760": "Why not furnish an unequivocal explanation of its object?",
  "5761": "Do you see that mainmast there?",
  "5762": "Any letters for me?",
  "5763": "Why are you so upset?",
  "5764": "Have you never felt the romance of that love?",
  "5765": "An explanation, pray, of what?",
  "5766": "And how on earth do they get at it?",
  "5767": "Do they get you bairns?",
  "5768": "Cannot one find friends among the animals, and choose some tame kid or eloquent parrot or amiable monkey?",
  "5769": "You wish to exchange crosses?",
  "5770": "Well, and did you like it very much?",
  "5771": "Would you mind describing him to me?",
  "5772": "But do you understand the mission you are fulfilling?",
  "5773": "What do YOU mean, mother?",
  "5774": "How about accidents?",
  "5775": "Do you think this is the end?",
  "5776": "Doing well, I suppose?",
  "5777": "Where 'bouts do you live?",
  "5778": "And then, mother?",
  "5779": "Do you sometimes think that I took an unfair advantage of your weakness?",
  "5780": "In what way did you mean it, sir?",
  "5781": "What did the gentleman say to her, my sonny?",
  "5782": "Did he name no one in his passion?",
  "5783": "What kind of political ambition was to result from this destructive political education?",
  "5784": "He knows them, then?",
  "5785": "Could narrow passages spread from it through the foundations of the island?",
  "5786": "Suppose we were to meet any of them?",
  "5787": "She wants to be admired, does she?",
  "5788": "Have you anything?",
  "5789": "And what is the cause of this?",
  "5790": "Or flatter sorry bunglers?",
  "5791": "By my orders?",
  "5792": "So you do not plead guilty?",
  "5793": "Now, are not you fancying, gentlemen, that I am expressing remorse for something now, that I am asking your forgiveness for something?",
  "5794": "Would a man grow weary of such a look turned on him, of such arms held out?",
  "5795": "Why does she give me notice when it's too late?",
  "5796": "I suppose they'll take her back, won't they?",
  "5797": "D'ye know anything of it?",
  "5798": "Why then do we not follow his example, doing as he did in the countries through which we pass?",
  "5799": "Cancel?",
  "5800": "And have you forgiven her for all she has made you suffer?",
  "5801": "Which of us is there can tell how much vanity lurks in our warmest regard for others, and how selfish our love is?",
  "5802": "Has the owner many ships?",
  "5803": "To a distance?",
  "5804": "This house?",
  "5805": "You think it would?",
  "5806": "Are you having a good time?",
  "5807": "Have you heard this?",
  "5808": "Why, where have you been?",
  "5809": "But now who will relieve me of the dread?",
  "5810": "Have the which?",
  "5811": "Why don't you snap your oars, you rascals?",
  "5812": "Is it not obvious?",
  "5813": "Why did you come to tell me yourself, instead of sending my man?",
  "5814": "Holidays?",
  "5815": "I mean did you see the statue fall?",
  "5816": "And she refused you as she says?",
  "5817": "Father went away to give us children room, didn't he?",
  "5818": "Durbeyfield?",
  "5819": "Can I see the letter?",
  "5820": "In what then, pray, shall I obey you?",
  "5821": "Why should you make a principle out of what you yourselves are, and must be?",
  "5822": "Why should we imagine that the precious metals are likely to do so?",
  "5823": "And what did he answer?",
  "5824": "What IS the matter?",
  "5825": "Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?",
  "5826": "What could he say to her now, after all he had said formerly, when he held her hands as he kissed her hair beside her cheeks?",
  "5827": "No female nurses?",
  "5828": "How did you happen to think of it?",
  "5829": "Where, then, is the power of your wealthy man?",
  "5830": "And what can I do but obey their commands?",
  "5831": "Would it, indeed, have been better if we had loved each other as a boy and a girl, and forgotten it?",
  "5832": "What social and political rights have women?",
  "5833": "And are they arrested?",
  "5834": "Puffs?",
  "5835": "Didn't they denounce the fenian movement from the pulpit and in the confession box?",
  "5836": "Isn't it time to skim it, my dear?",
  "5837": "Where do they come from, then?",
  "5838": "Marriage?",
  "5839": "Now, sir, why are you late again, as usual?",
  "5840": "Might anybody ask what their brother has been saying?",
  "5841": "Well, my children, what is going on now?",
  "5842": "What death?",
  "5843": "To what party did he belong?",
  "5844": "Does that suggest nothing to you?",
  "5845": "Where away?",
  "5846": "How did you penetrate hither?",
  "5847": "Caught cold in the grottos, at night, perhaps?",
  "5848": "You are sure?",
  "5849": "Well, and what did the last one say to ye?",
  "5850": "Did you come in the gig?",
  "5851": "And the DISENCHANTMENT of woman is in progress?",
  "5852": "Had your breakfast yet?",
  "5853": "Could he write something original?",
  "5854": "Breakfast?",
  "5855": "You are incredulous, are you?",
  "5856": "Now what does this imply?",
  "5857": "What possessed him to turn listener?",
  "5858": "Is this not a quite unusual politeness?",
  "5859": "Whatever have you done now?",
  "5860": "Are these things nothing?",
  "5861": "Did my sons get power and money?",
  "5862": "If they are such a happy class of people, how was it that you had such a time of punishing and hanging them within the last two years?",
  "5863": "And I have no doubt she loves you like a brother?",
  "5864": "And what have you been thinking about THEM, my busy bee?",
  "5865": "But how will it be?",
  "5866": "Could anything exceed the picture he gives one of scientific ardour?",
  "5867": "There is no exit that way?",
  "5868": "But was he worse?",
  "5869": "Yet how long before it was unsettled again?",
  "5870": "Philanthropy's sake?",
  "5871": "Or are they late because they have had a lovers' meeting?",
  "5872": "Is he very ill?",
  "5873": "Did he know them before?",
  "5874": "Cranly asked softly, happier than you are now, for instance?",
  "5875": "Why, what on earth does she do here?",
  "5876": "What does it matter to me whether the prince is to be what the late king was?",
  "5877": "Didn't I tell you now, mum, as it 'ud hurt your feelings to look at my pack?",
  "5878": "How can I urge my daughters now to go and raise large families?",
  "5879": "And what did it matter?",
  "5880": "What are you meddling with, stupid?",
  "5881": "Why do you specify the fox?",
  "5882": "Who said that?",
  "5883": "But you have found out something for yourself?",
  "5884": "Well, what if I could?",
  "5885": "Did you bet?",
  "5886": "Are you not weary of that stupid, meaningless, constantly repeated fraud?",
  "5887": "I say, you're not putting off a party tonight, are you?",
  "5888": "Were monuments to be reared to his honor, titles to be lavished upon his name?",
  "5889": "Well, then, what'll we make him the ink out of?",
  "5890": "But, bishop, the question is, who has the power to settle it?",
  "5891": "Don't you trust me?",
  "5892": "What does friendship mean if it not so?",
  "5893": "Well, what time for repayment do you wish me to take?",
  "5894": "Whuzzis?",
  "5895": "Why is the hawk so hated by birds?",
  "5896": "About measures, or rhythms, or verses?",
  "5897": "What sort of young woman?",
  "5898": "Do you know where I shall find him?",
  "5899": "I sprung out of bed, and asked, what wreck?",
  "5900": "Are you sure this time?",
  "5901": "Would he have drawn back?",
  "5902": "Had ever a queen such a throne before?",
  "5903": "And what do YOU want?",
  "5904": "Or was he a debtor or a debtor's son?",
  "5905": "Not quite so far, I hope?",
  "5906": "You are not angry with me?",
  "5907": "For what is maintenance?",
  "5908": "What will you?",
  "5909": "What does this mean?",

  "7162": "Or where was he?",
  "7163": "Heather on fire?",
  "7164": "If one's not to live together, what's the use of marrying?",

  "7168": "Isn't she ripe now?",
  "7169": "But what do you intend to do?",
  "7170": "Where's your brother?",
  "7171": "I come for my girl, see?",
  "7172": "Do you then make nothing at all of her having been so ready to leave us?",
  "7173": "For what do good men who make the best soldiers fight?",
  "7174": "What is your last name again, say you?",
  "7175": "They haven't anything, have they?",
  "7176": "Is it me you want?",
  "7177": "And this lady?",
  "7178": "Object to him, guardian?",
  "7179": "Who sent it me?",
  "7180": "You've not heard?",
  "7181": "What can you do with a man like that?",
  "7182": "Do these animals possess a power of communicating with each other?",
  "7183": "Well, but wasn't it the most fortunate thing in the world?",
  "7184": "Will you never learn?",
  "7185": "Do you live here in the city?",
  "7186": "Shouldn't we light a lantern?",
  "7187": "What was the relation between them, and what the object of his repeated visits?",
  "7188": "You mistrust me, then, master pedant, do you?",
  "7189": "Was ever the like?",
  "7190": "Does not this little book clear up the mystery of your parentage?",
  "7191": "If the news is not to be bad why have our weapons been taken from us?",
  "7192": "Can't I go away from here, run away, bury myself somewhere?",
  "7193": "Else why should he talk about his 'twenty minutes past' and about his having no watch to tell the time by?",
  "7194": "More?",
  "7195": "Or doth the animal speak in thy wish, and necessity?",
  "7196": "Who sends you?",
  "7197": "Can you, ma'am?",
  "7198": "Who can 'scape his bow?",
  "7199": "Of course you agree to have a battle?",

  "7212": "You've not done right, have you, now?",
  "7213": "Do you hear me, you fairy spirit?",
  "7214": "Is history to be written from such documents?",
  "7215": "Is what this paper says, the truth?",
  "7216": "And can you forget so soon what I proposed to you the other night?",
  "7217": "But, madame, what can he do, unless he has a kingdom to back him?",
  "7218": "Where was my son?",
  "7219": "But does not the present case fairly constitute an exception?",
  "7220": "English money?",
  "7221": "How could she extricate herself from this labyrinth?",
  "7222": "But what shall we do now?",
  "7223": "Know you of what materials some hearts are made?",
  "7224": "This other gentleman is in the preaching line, I think?",

  "7226": "What's her trump card?",
  "7227": "She is not another man's wife, and it appears that she has married me according to the custom of this awful place, so who is the worse?",
  "7228": "Gracious goodness, and who's to make my chocolate?",
  "7229": "Why, what class are they?",
  "7230": "Can I have fifty?",
  "7231": "Would it not be a sweet revenge for him when he found that I had not died from the blow of his dagger?",
  "7232": "They will not blunder?",
  "7233": "Why do I say this?",
  "7234": "Can you read?",
  "7235": "And you are disposed to serve the cause of the people?",
  "7236": "Do you or don't you?",
  "7237": "But how shall I prevent his departure, if that should turn out to be my last resource?",
  "7238": "Wonder how old he is?",
  "7239": "You prefer not to perhaps?",
  "7240": "Are you?",
  "7241": "And could you see if my brother is here, and send him to me?",
  "7242": "And if he chances to return again?",
  "7243": "Oh, you mean commercially?",
  "7244": "Will you tell me?",
  "7245": "From whence do these papers come, you say?",
  "7246": "Will you take the time from me?",
  "7247": "And the reason why the good are useless has now been explained?",
  "7248": "P'raps you might be writin' to her?",
  "7249": "At what point shall I begin my story, your excellency?",
  "7250": "Who knows what unhappiness may not be lurking for me, ready to spring at any moment?",
  "7251": "Will you leave him to the allurements of the world and the devil?",
  "7252": "Can't you do anything except soldiers?",
  "7253": "Who has ordered you to beat the alarm?",
  "7254": "What ones?",
  "7255": "What is the percentage?",
  "7256": "What responsibilities?",
  "7257": "You mean that the person will come again?",
  "7258": "To whom, then?",
  "7259": "And that will be soon, will it not?",
  "7260": "Why were they so desirous of having me for their host?",
  "7261": "Had I overrated the importance of the discovery?",
  "7262": "At this time o' night, and such a night?",
  "7263": "Where an the sweetmeats?",
  "7264": "So you know his name?",
  "7265": "What is to be done with him?",
  "7266": "What on earth for?",
  "7267": "Don't you know father better than that by this time?",
  "7268": "Tell me who made the world?",
  "7269": "Is he one of your acquaintance?",
  "7270": "Are you awfully unhappy?",
  "7271": "What, then, is the matter with them?",
  "7272": "But you can dance?",
  "7273": "Do we not make our livings by doing nought of any good?",
  "7274": "Is he never robbed?",
  "7275": "For why, say they, should they commit an act of aggression, when he and his kindred can so easily repay them?",
  "7276": "Andrea?",
  "7277": "Father, why have you thus incens'd them both?",
  "7278": "Do you say that I am deserting my enslaved brethren?",
  "7279": "Why am I not to talk about it?",
  "7280": "Then, how did it happen?",
  "7281": "Don't you hear the hammer at work?",
  "7282": "Is the team harnessed?",
  "7283": "Can you read this language?",
  "7284": "He?",
  "7285": "Who do you like best downstairs?",
  "7286": "Will you be a little more explicit?",
  "7287": "Suppose he were in a railway train, would they stop it for him?",
  "7288": "Can we afford to sin any more deeply against human liberty?",
  "7289": "Might it not be better simply to buy up the editorial staff?",
  "7290": "And who was the winner?",
  "7291": "After all, what does it matter?",
  "7292": "You will?",
  "7293": "What reason have you to be morose?",
  "7294": "Are you telling the truth when you say you are not in love?",
  "7295": "And why is it?",
  "7296": "Susan, you agree?",
  "7297": "Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me?",
  "7298": "Must they give him up?",
  "7299": "Did he kill anybody?",
  "7300": "Why should I take you for him?",
  "7301": "Would you be pleased to walk into the garden?",
  "7302": "Especially as at that time we didn't know one another quite so well as we do now, did we, dear?",
  "7303": "Then why venture there?",
  "7304": "Is she very angry with me?",
  "7305": "Yes what?",
  "7306": "In what way?",
  "7307": "And why is that chronique the elaborately absurd set of legends which we find in all mythologies?",
  "7308": "But why do you not go to the inn?",
  "7309": "A prisoner?",
  "7310": "Are there reasons?",
  "7311": "Is there, indeed, my good fellow?",
  "7312": "Is it your habit to swear much in talking?",
  "7313": "What became of your magic tools?",
  "7314": "You have been resident in my house three months?",
  "7315": "How can we best do it?",
  "7316": "How many of us are here?",
  "7317": "May I ask, in the meanwhile, whether you have yourself any theory to account for this young man's disappearance?",
  "7318": "Have not I, the king, the right to ask of you all that?",
  "7319": "Don't you want to tidy yourself?",
  "7320": "What is the matter in the crowd behind us?",
  "7321": "What made you ask him that?",
  "7322": "Go away?",
  "7323": "And who were the enemy?",
  "7324": "But why any proclamation now upon this subject?",
  "7325": "You'll soon have plenty to do now, dear, won't you?",
  "7326": "One only?",
  "7327": "How about it, then?",
  "7328": "Do you see, stupid?",
  "7329": "How dare you remind me of that horrid dinner party, when yours is so nice in every way?",
  "7330": "Are you fond of it?",
  "7331": "Back?",
  "7332": "Who could entreat a child to desert her parent?",
  "7333": "We mayn't even be sorry for her?",
  "7334": "What did you play at, boy?",
  "7335": "He is a very fine man, don't you think so?",
  "7336": "Why does not your honor give orders for a raft to be constructed?",
  "7337": "At what hour does he commonly rise?",
  "7338": "Is it true, pray?",
  "7339": "England in existence?",
  "7340": "No good blood in their veins?",
  "7341": "You say your husband's ill?",
  "7342": "Is there no one else?",
  "7343": "What do YOU think of when you go mooning about alone?",
  "7344": "Perhaps you didn't know that he was clean ruined?",

  "7346": "Are you going with him?",
  "7347": "Did he come himself, or send over a deputy?",
  "7348": "Is it the principle of knowledge or of goodness, or the union of the two?",
  "7349": "Did you believe that I should go with no farewell to those who haf been so heavenly kind to me?",
  "7350": "Was the mission one in which gentleness would be possible?",
  "7351": "For what purpose do you put such a question to me?",
  "7352": "And what concern is that of mine?",
  "7353": "His financial position?",
  "7354": "Have you still a shadow of an objection to offer?",
  "7355": "Who could save him who denies his own salvation?",
  "7356": "And who'll we rob?",
  "7357": "So you lost your place because you got sick, eh?",
  "7358": "What have you to say to that?",
  "7359": "Are you very glad to have discovered it?",
  "7360": "Did he?",
  "7361": "But upon what did we rest the creations of our genius?",
  "7362": "Would you recognize him if you saw him again?",

  "7370": "Splendid?",
  "7371": "What does the twilight matter?",
  "7372": "In the centre?",
  "7373": "And it would be a disgrace to marry so, eh?",
  "7374": "NOW, where are these imminent dangers?",
  "7375": "Or, meeting so, why did we not part as strangers?",
  "7376": "What would papa say to that?",
  "7377": "Does she know that you mean to marry her?",
  "7378": "Would she tack about in the bay to pick up stray coasters as prizes, or would she land soldiers to burn the town?",
  "7379": "Do you mean to say that anyone would be mug enough to part with solid cash just to shake hands with my uncle?",
  "7380": "Eternal sorrows what avails to shed?",

  "7391": "How did he know all this?",
  "7392": "What regiment?",
  "7393": "Is that so much that he deserves this praise?",
  "7394": "How did he get there with a child?",
  "7395": "And you reply?",
  "7396": "Do you not admire her?",
  "7397": "Bids she not to be wary?",
  "7398": "Is it not enough to render twin children unwelcome?",
  "7399": "Doesn't it seem very long to wait?",
  "7400": "How dare you say he is dishonorable?",

  "7404": "What's the rent?",
  "7405": "Like a demd native?",
  "7406": "What for, sire?",

  "7417": "Shifts she thus?",
  "7418": "Pay him?",
  "7419": "What flood?",
  "7420": "Is it a man you seen?",
  "7421": "Do you believe that?",
  "7422": "But how does that come about?",
  "7423": "Can we do aught to assist the wretched man?",
  "7424": "Did he say when the battles are to begin?",
  "7425": "How can I find her?",
  "7426": "How do you know?",
  "7427": "What greater luck could he have than to be brought safely home to his father?",
  "7428": "Or is your brain really unhinged?",
  "7429": "And what was then his conduct?",
  "7430": "So you've come, you rascal?",
  "7431": "Is it not truly to ransom prisoners?",
  "7432": "But does that part of the body understand or what?",
  "7433": "Did you mark my words?",
  "7434": "Do you despair now?",
  "7435": "What, I say, is to become of those wretches?",
  "7436": "Do you know that I am growing old?",
  "7437": "How then is it that those people pretend to reject reason?",
  "7438": "Why doesn't he get away?",
  "7439": "Did I say, a few days since, that I had nothing to do with him but to receive my salary at his hands?",
  "7440": "And to what end can it serve either for the service of mankind, or for my own private interest?",
  "7441": "In the few hours that I can possibly allow to elapse before I publish the truth, how is he to be found by us, and only by us?",
  "7442": "Will you have a glass of brandy?",
  "7443": "And fetch him where?",
  "7444": "You know?",
  "7445": "Not crush that accursed race?",
  "7446": "Our conversation yesterday?",
  "7447": "But won't you take one look at him, first, miss?",
  "7448": "An' it ain't much t' ask, is it?",
  "7449": "Williams?",
  "7450": "Why did she not wait till the morrow?",
  "7451": "Where did she pick up this companion?",
  "7452": "Why, don't you see what's happened?",
  "7453": "Then it's NOT postponed?",
  "7454": "Then why don't you die?",
  "7455": "Now are you both ready?",
  "7456": "Can ye say to the grave, give up the murdered?",
  "7457": "And those hands, pale and inert, lying on the coverlet before him, could they be his own?",
  "7458": "Oh, is he going to take you for a nice drive?",
  "7459": "Surely not let them go unpunished?",
  "7460": "Is that true?",
  "7461": "And aren't we going to?",
  "7462": "What is it, on the other hand, that makes the lawyer eschew his own cause, and call in his learned brother as an adviser?",
  "7463": "You know, monseigneur, we set out in search of our comrades?",
  "7464": ", or to go about and beg?",
  "7465": "But don't you want to be?",
  "7466": "Yes, miss?",
  "7467": "Have you quite recovered that scoundrel's attack?",
  "7468": "Somebody else?",
  "7469": "You don't mean that, I am sure?",
  "7470": "In the king's service?",
  "7471": "Why, what is important?",
  "7472": "Where are you living?",
  "7473": "But what is straightforward?",
  "7474": "Have you left your liver behind you?",
  "7475": "Was he not holy enough or why could he not catch up on the others?",
  "7476": "Does that mean you'll come?",
  "7477": "Please do this for me, will you?",
  "7478": "What's amiss?",
  "7479": "Was it imbecility or craft?",

  "7487": "Hasn't he money?",
  "7488": "What is the process?",
  "7489": "Who could speak to him?",
  "7490": "But who perpetrated that joke, let me ask?",
  "7491": "Is there any difficulty in the way?",
  "7492": "Where will their insolence stop?",
  "7493": "Is this aggression?",
  "7494": "Which of the two will hurl the other over?",
  "7495": "Did she ever talk of revisiting the place?",
  "7496": "Does it not seem that there is a hatred of the virgin forest and of the tropics among moralists?",

  "7498": "What has been decided?",
  "7499": "You shall stay here, do you hear?",
  "7500": "What's become of the boy?",
  "7501": "Where could he?",

  "7511": "Is there anything the matter?",
  "7512": "A warning for himself?",
  "7513": "To sit?",

  "7523": "And have you had any shooting yet this year?",
  "7524": "Wait a minute, would you mind?",
  "7525": "What evil memory is this?",
  "7526": "For what is bombast but a force of expression too great for the magnitude of the ideas embodied?",

  "7537": "What, are you no longer in possession of your senses?",
  "7538": "Is it a note?",
  "7539": "Now, what sum have you about you?",
  "7540": "Is it your bashfulness, said he, or your obstinacy, that makes you not choose I should read it before you?",
  "7541": "But how, then, could he have known my reply if it had been in the negative?",
  "7542": "Might I ask in which direction you are going?",

  "7575": "And had ye ony sister?",
  "7576": "How do you expect to manage the balloon?",
  "7577": "Who is coming here so early in the morning?",
  "7578": "Why, surely he has not changed his mind about marrying?",
  "7579": "I should like to know upon what occasion?",
  "7580": "Am I falling?",
  "7581": "But what is it, CHERIE?",
  "7582": "What's the use of my getting well?",
  "7583": "What is the use of that?",
  "7584": "He had great confidence in my opinion, and what did I think?",
  "7585": "Joy?",
  "7586": "Do I perceive the man whom I see, when I look into a mirror, to be behind the mirror or in front of it?",
  "7587": "Where's your aunt, miss?",
  "7588": "Then you prefer to go to the temples?",
  "7589": "Is he on his own or is he entirely in with them?",
  "7590": "Why grieve?",
  "7591": "Did you recognize your coachman?",
  "7592": "And this is the little girl you have adopted, I suppose?",
  "7593": "Hear ye?",
  "7594": "What's the next?",
  "7595": "Were you waiting for me?",
  "7596": "This very instant?",
  "7597": "But who can endure to be wedded to a dish?",
  "7598": "Go and where shall I find you?",
  "7599": "Will he return this evening?",
  "7600": "Not when you are with me?",
  "7601": "Is he at home?",
  "7602": "Shall I e'er forget it, mun?",
  "7603": "Do you hate it?",
  "7604": "How a wedding present?",
  "7605": "What else?",
  "7606": "He considered victory to be a thing that was impossible, and even with a victory, what would have become of the expedition?",
  "7607": "And he was alone in achieving an enterprise like that?",
  "7608": "Why has she refused him?",
  "7609": "Why is there an allusion to that cursed 'poor knight' in the anonymous letter?",
  "7610": "Didn't he get the telegram?",
  "7611": "Don't you call to mind what he says?",
  "7612": "And what sort of young lady is she?",
  "7613": "Has a duplicate key been found in his possession?",
  "7614": "Didn't you feel the ground shake?",
  "7615": "How will you travel?",
  "7616": "How many did they say?",
  "7617": "You are not convinced yet?",
  "7618": "Have you provided yourself with money?",
  "7619": "I'm rather on the spot this evening, eh?",
  "7620": "Did she see you?",
  "7621": "Do people die of it?",
  "7622": "I suppose there is nothing to prevent it?",
  "7623": "Did not my neck glitter with diamonds?",
  "7624": "How comes it?",
  "7625": "How otherwise should I have been bad enough?",
  "7626": "You do not reply?",
  "7627": "Then would you call injustice malignity?",
  "7628": "Which will conquer?",
  "7629": "Well, what did the king say?",
  "7630": "Are you sure you're quite so much as six foot three?",
  "7631": "And why, may I ask?",
  "7632": "But we have grain belonging to my brother?",
  "7633": "Do ye love brandy?",
  "7634": "I've given you all the clothes you wanted, haven't I?",
  "7635": "Is that so, sir?",
  "7636": "What course would then have been left to him?",
  "7637": "Do you hear that baggage?",
  "7638": "Must believe?",
  "7639": "How should I know, my dear?",
  "7640": "Why should its existence be prolonged one hour?",
  "7641": "If the prince knew propriety, who does not know it?",
  "7642": "Now, we ask, what was there in this cave to cause a departure from the ordinary course of nature?",
  "7643": "What's the matter aloft there?",
  "7644": "Should war break out in any of those countries who can foretell the extent to which it may be carried or the desolation which it may spread?",
  "7645": "Quite certain?",
  "7646": "Well?",
  "7647": "And what sort of revenge would you take?",
  "7648": "Is it a time of war?",
  "7649": "I suppose that there has been no answer from my cabman advertisement?",
  "7650": "But what made you think the writing looked like that of the crazy machinist who tried to wreck the projectile?",
  "7651": "At this hour who would pass now?",
  "7652": "And what the devil do you wake me for?",
  "7653": "So you've got back?",
  "7654": "Then why don't you turn her out?",
  "7655": "Why should he go to a play if he enjoys it so little?",
  "7656": "Was it an angel's voice?",
  "7657": "Why, then, had he come hither?",
  "7658": "What was his version?",
  "7659": "Yet what good end can all this superficial counsel produce?",
  "7660": "What's the report of this boy?",
  "7661": "Take a glass of wine?",
  "7662": "And what has become of that scoundrel?",
  "7663": "But, what will you do?",
  "7664": "Are you coming down and fight fair?",
  "7665": "But what is the meaning of all this?",
  "7666": "Where be the dogs?",
  "7667": "Who is the master of the temple?",
  "7668": "And won't you come too?",
  "7669": "Well, what have I learned since?",
  "7670": "En didn't I bust up agin a lot er dem islands en have a turrible time en mos' git drownded?",
  "7671": "Would it bore you if I came in for a quarter of an hour?",
  "7672": "But if I disagree with his lordship's views?",
  "7673": "What can they mean?",
  "7674": "He has had punch already, has he not, sir?",
  "7675": "Shall you come down in the world for want of this letter about your son?",
  "7676": "So, then, you must leave us?",
  "7677": "But at any rate I have shown, have I not, that there is a certain element of improbability about the lady's story?",
  "7678": "And do you use this often?",
  "7679": "Has he got any?",
  "7680": "Are they friendly to us, do you think?",
  "7681": "Me alone?",
  "7682": "And you allow then, sir, that spheres exist, and that these marked and invisible beings mingle amongst us?",
  "7683": "Who knows if they will not manage to restore to me my pension?",
  "7684": "Poodle?",
  "7685": "Is she dead?",
  "7686": "But were you not on horseback?",
  "7687": "Is the countess up yet?",
  "7688": "Then this young man escaped with you?",
  "7689": "Where are my armies, my troops, my treasures?",
  "7690": "Canler?",
  "7691": "Do you belong to the number of the happy or of the miserable?",
  "7692": "But why couldn't he let me know?",
  "7693": "Will you promise to be quiet, and not kick up a fuss if I get you something to eat?",
  "7694": "And they not rich?",
  "7695": "In the rouge way?",
  "7696": "She did not resist, for what could she do?",
  "7697": "I shall hear from you?",
  "7698": "What what is, my dear?",
  "7699": "What did you do yesterday afternoon?",
  "7700": "Exploring or what?",
  "7701": "Why was he carried in a cart?",
  "7702": "Why surprised?",
  "7703": "What are you kicking up this row for?",
  "7704": "Yet are you not sorry for fellows of that stamp?",
  "7705": "What if he turns against the others?",
  "7706": "For is not my lord the son of a king?",
  "7707": "Why is it so long?",
  "7708": "Will he even pay me for his lodging?",
  "7709": "A mistake?",
  "7710": "Shall any man hate me?",
  "7711": "Two figures?",
  "7712": "What will dart out presently?",
  "7713": "Does he regret me a little?",
  "7714": "How do you look at the question?",
  "7715": "You remember?",
  "7716": "Then why are there different faiths?",
  "7717": "What be they?",
  "7718": "Have you any further commands for me?",
  "7719": "Won't you dine with me?",
  "7720": "There's her boots now, nice and decent for her evening use, and isn't it grand brushes she has?",
  "7721": "Is this your pupil?",
  "7722": "And what, pray, WAS the price?",
  "7723": "How is it with you?",
  "7724": "What o'clock is it?",
  "7725": "In company with a mean sort of a fellow, dressed in black?",
  "7726": "Surely the writer does not mean that a pleasant or delectable island would not be fit for breeding horses?",
  "7727": "You are a good temper?",
  "7728": "Had the crew seen me disappear?",
  "7729": "Don't you think we will?",
  "7730": "Now, do you understand me?",
  "7731": "How many times will I have to speak of this matter?",
  "7732": "On your arm?",
  "7733": "I understand, however, from the inquest that there were some objects which you failed to overlook?",
  "7734": "Why don't you go and get it then?",
  "7735": "Where are the graces of my soul?",
  "7736": "Do you know, sir, said she, that her ladyship intends to be down here with you in a few days?",
  "7737": "What is the meaning of this hunt, skipper?",
  "7738": "Why, had you no unicorn's horn, nor bezoar's stone about you, ha?",
  "7739": "Did you really think me capable of that?",
  "7740": "How do you like her, my dear?",
  "7741": "Shall I sure?",
  "7742": "And what did the master answer?",
  "7743": "Bobby?",
  "7744": "Is she sorry for her shameful conduct?",
  "7745": "Had he found some madman's means of proclaiming the scandal aloud?",
  "7746": "Whose portraits are those?",
  "7747": "What was the subject of these singular conversations?",
  "7748": "Is it a check to the action of the individual?",
  "7749": "She is melancholy, then?",
  "7750": "Have you noticed THAT THEY WON'T LET ANY ONE TOUCH THEM?",
  "7751": "What sympathy should a holy preacher have with either?",
  "7752": "Is is a bargain?",
  "7753": "Would not your excellency like a little refreshment?",
  "7754": "So, then, they have paid my ransom?",
  "7755": "Well, mademoiselle, what are you thinking about, standing there like a statue?",
  "7756": "Will you undertake the task?",
  "7757": "Tell me, will you do this for me, and cease to weep?",
  "7758": "Come, how much?",
  "7759": "Do you know, sir, that you are asking me very strange questions, and that I am very foolish to answer them?",
  "7760": "Shall I climb the magnolia?",
  "7761": "What becomes of them?",
  "7762": "You aren't angry, are you?",
  "7763": "Eh, madame, who knows?",
  "7764": "The ghost?",
  "7765": "Then why hasn't she missed him before?",
  "7766": "Gwendolen, will you marry me?",
  "7767": "Wouldn't you like to know who I am, child?",
  "7768": "Will you not rest here?",
  "7769": "What were you thinking of?",
  "7770": "You let my mother alone, will you?",
  "7771": "But what are you going to do?",
  "7772": "What proof may there be that you can do your part in the compact?",
  "7773": "You won't go back?",
  "7774": "Does he play well?",
  "7775": "Then what?",
  "7776": "Do you mean to say you have had my cigarette case all this time?",
  "7777": "Won't you come along with me?",
  "7778": "What do we mean when we say that one man isn't to be trusted as another?",
  "7779": "What shall we do then?",
  "7780": "Jean, do you think that I am quite mad?",
  "7781": "Why is not her joy complete?",
  "7782": "Do you know his abode?",
  "7783": "And who was this uncle?",
  "7784": "And will not such things sharpen your souls to revenge?",
  "7785": "Oh, what do you want?",
  "7786": "Who asked after a day or two?",
  "7787": "How could she have been so blind?",
  "7788": "Is this our previous understanding?",
  "7789": "Certainly, why not?",
  "7790": "What orders, your excellency?",
  "7791": "Suppose the worst?",
  "7792": "Then you will not resign, under any circumstances?",
  "7793": "What was the fist?",
  "7794": "My pretty lady, are you come to stay with us?",
  "7795": "What is their object?",
  "7796": "Do I know myself?",
  "7797": "Is he alone?",
  "7798": "And is there not a species of deceit in this to which the honesty of the present age should lend no countenance?",
  "7799": "You who never interest yourself in politics?",
  "7800": "Was it because I wished to give you pain?",
  "7801": "Have WE horns on our heads?",
  "7802": "What on earth do you mean?",
  "7803": "And what about it after all?",
  "7804": "Do you fancy that you can deceive him?",
  "7805": "But, pardon me, have you heard anything of that son?",
  "7806": "Is there any principle in these things?",
  "7807": "A convert to what?",
  "7808": "Who ever did?",
  "7809": "That is an important point, do you understand?",
  "7810": "And what do you mean by your look?",
  "7811": "Guleesh, you clown, you thief, that no good may happen you, why did you play that trick on us?",
  "7812": "Then may I telegraph to the advocate?",
  "7813": "Break off all intercourse with him?",
  "7814": "How do we discover that, in an isosceles triangle, the sides which subtend the equal angles are equal?",
  "7815": "Am I so unlike my countrymen?",
  "7816": "Did you ever know men rise by their own merit under kings?",
  "7817": "And the woman?",
  "7818": "And how do you like being your own mistress?",
  "7819": "Besides, how was he to again traverse that quagmire whence he had only extricated himself as by a miracle?",
  "7820": "But, indeed, what can you expect, monseigneur?",
  "7821": "But can you stay till tomowwow?",
  "7822": "Where shall I meet you?",
  "7823": "You have to confess something?",
  "7824": "Don't you feel the same?",
  "7825": "And the name of the third?",
  "7826": "Did she say anything more?",
  "7827": "If I am guilty, why am I more fit for a second consulship than I was for my first one?",
  "7828": "Was it not rather because his life was full of bliss that he found strength to live?",
  "7829": "Is it possible that he can have lived at the bottom of the sea?",
  "7830": "If not, why should you come to consult me?",
  "7831": "Then you have discovered the means of guiding a balloon?",
  "7832": "Why, where did you leave her?",
  "7833": "How did he hurt himself?",
  "7834": "What shall he be called by us?",
  "7835": "Shall I travel?",
  "7836": "BUT WHAT NEXT?",
  "7837": "You with an old father, and you with pleasant and playful ways?",
  "7838": "Why have your companions deserted you?",
  "7839": "You have promised him that I shall live?",
  "7840": "When shall we two walk together?",
  "7841": "How am I to believe you at present?",
  "7842": "What dress would you like?",
  "7843": "Will you ask me to call it, being for me?",
  "7844": "To whom else could she in such plight look for love?",
  "7845": "What does every one who wants to step into the street do?",
  "7846": "Did you make up anything else?",
  "7847": "Fitted to sustain the weight of armor, or to practise the exercises of the camp?",
  "7848": "O'Dowd?",
  "7849": "Did she forget me, in the course of time?",
  "7850": "What are you but the paid tool of the capitalists, hired by them to club or shoot your poorer fellow citizen?",
  "7851": "Do you want to be a gentleman, to spite her or to gain her over?",
  "7852": "With what kind of parental reflections can the father or mother contemplate their younger offspring?",
  "7853": "Why do you talk of wages?",
  "7854": "Isn't it?",
  "7855": "Cunningham's?",
  "7856": "Is that more likely to settle it than every one of these previous attempts to settle the slavery agitation?",
  "7857": "Why so early?",
  "7858": "Is thy witness in writing?",
  "7859": "Then why did she run away the moment I came in?",
  "7860": "Why do you run so fast?",
  "7861": "Does not that strike you?",
  "7862": "And when will the dance begin?",
  "7863": "Then you are quite at ease, my lord?",
  "7864": "Don't you feel sorry for him, sometimes?",
  "7865": "What did I see there?",
  "7866": "Nothing will stop you?",
  "7867": "Why should the generations overlap one another at all?",
  "7868": "Where did she find him?",
  "7869": "How could he be alive?",
  "7870": "Who could have done less for her?",
  "7871": "Who can it be, then?",
  "7872": "And why should you take trouble?",
  "7873": "Or does he feel that he is sketching an inescapable human condition which makes all of us bear the burden of loneliness?",
  "7874": "You have not allowed him to penetrate your secret, then?",
  "7875": "You keep it on?",
  "7876": "Or are they digging side by side on different lines?",
  "7877": "Be so good as send for one, will you?",
  "7878": "Who is it, then?",
  "7879": "Neither can we procure horses?",
  "7880": "What did you go into the pool for?",
  "7881": "Doth this happen, because with women nothing is impossible?",
  "7882": "She is not doing well, you mean?",
  "7883": "How was it done?",
  "7884": "And you will pardon me?",
  "7885": "Are you there?",
  "7886": "And their reason is what you call their romance?",
  "7887": "To whom?",
  "7888": "Will you walk a little faster?",
  "7889": "Would monsieur like me to put him to bed?",
  "7890": "What matter does that make if it is so?",
  "7891": "I hope you don't suppose those are real tears?",
  "7892": "What IN?",
  "7893": "Do you want to rob me, or to murder me?",
  "7894": "Do you care for me?",
  "7895": "Is it to be built on?",
  "7896": "Then must we resign ourselves to destruction?",
  "7897": "What wine please you have, sir?",
  "7898": "Why not start counting at a half of one?",
  "7899": "How dare you sit down in my presence?",
  "7900": "Well, but, leaving his land out of the question, do you like him?",
  "7901": "Is that what you're here for?",
  "7902": "And if so, could he explain its mystery?",
  "7903": "What general had not feared at such revolt?",
  "7904": "Why uninhabitable?",
  "7905": "Who are you to give orders here?",
  "7906": "But do we thus extend the limits of our knowledge beyond the field of possible experience?",
  "7907": "Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?",
  "7908": "What had passed between that wooden leg and the other?",
  "7909": "How is it likely I should guess?",
  "7910": "And do not you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head?",
  "7911": "Did you ever hear anything equal to that?",
  "7912": "Are we strong?",
  "7913": "Is he so bad?",
  "7914": "That one of my gentlemen knew the secret of the million, and kept it?",
  "7915": "Are the odds in favor of fame against failure so great?",
  "7916": "Why do you sing thus, and with such a voice?",
  "7917": "Does human nature thus change utterly and from top to bottom?",
  "7918": "Do you submit to this tamely, or are public feeling and the voice of heaven against you?",
  "7919": "It was not half handsome enough of course for the boy, but wasn't it noble of him to think of bringing it to his mother?",
  "7920": "When was this interview?",
  "7921": "However did you get here?",
  "7922": "You have a house in town, I conclude?",
  "7923": "Did you reduce the results of your investigations to the shape of a report?",
  "7924": "Where's the beef and vegetables I sent home, and the pudding you promised?",
  "7925": "Are they the poorer or the worse?",

  "7929": "What mood were the steamboat men in when this bridge was burned?",
  "7930": "Doth not the moon make us drunken?",

  "7932": "What holds us?",
  "7933": "He wasn't a tall, handsome, dark young man?",
  "7934": "Have you killed the cardinal?",
  "7935": "What's the name of the gal?",
  "7936": "Where did you get them?",

  "7941": "But why is the experiment of an extended republic to be rejected, merely because it may comprise what is new?",
  "7942": "What have they besides, then?",
  "7943": "But who is going to cut up the beast?",
  "7944": "His father?",
  "7945": "Poison?",
  "7946": "Nothing but still thy husband and thy son?",
  "7947": "But how am I to get the monkey here?",
  "7948": "In what manner have you lost your riches?",
  "7949": "Well, shall we set off?",
  "7950": "What's he got to cry about?",
  "7951": "Have ye ne'er seen a sail crossing the sea, rounded and inflated, and trembling with the violence of the wind?",
  "7952": "It got rubbed off be my shoulders see?",
  "7953": "And suppose he called me?",
  "7954": "And now, when no one is looking on, why do I thus spare myself?",
  "7955": "Don't we know those 'receipts' of yours?",
  "7956": "Do you know me?",
  "7957": "Why has she done that?",
  "7958": "What, are they gone?",
  "7959": "But there, in the opposite direction, what was there?",
  "7960": "Heathcliff, what are you about, raising this stir?",
  "7961": "But why should I describe to you the paintings and the silken draperies with which the room was decorated?",
  "7962": "Why didn't she come to my house?",
  "7963": "Did you ever see anybody very like the prisoner?",
  "7964": "Won't you?",
  "7965": "Run away?",
  "7966": "But the eyeglasses?",
  "7967": "You're also waiting for the commander in chief?",

  "7992": "Is it for the like of that you're wanting?",
  "7993": "Perhaps it was one of the heathfolk going home?",
  "7994": "Do you know where we are?",

  "13128": "And did they repeat what you said?",
  "13129": "Why do you conceal your necessities from me?",
  "13130": "And how do YOU know that he left two million and a half of roubles?",
  "13131": "Do you know if the marriage settlement he promised me has come?",
  "13132": "Now, I ask, why was all this done, but from that extremely weak and expensive doctrine, that the country could not bear it?",
  "13133": "Don't I?",
  "13134": "Sturgis?",
  "13135": "And where mought you have come from?",

  "14448": "Are you sure of that now?",
  "14449": "Where were you in the moon when the snakes cast off their skins?",
  "14450": "That shock threw you as well as me into the sea?",
  "14451": "Where will you hop?",
  "14452": "How can you read?",
  "14453": "Who shall be brought to the block?",
  "14454": "Love, where is thy victory?",
  "14455": "Not know?",
  "14456": "Is sought by any other suitor?",
  "14457": "Why separate us?",
  "14458": "How do I live?",
  "14459": "Well, are we all ready?",
  "14460": "Together?",
  "14461": "He's dead?",
  "14462": "And it is not yours?",
  "14463": "On what, then, depended the establishment and maintenance of equality in conditions and fortunes?",
  "14464": "How then is it that they lose their native mildness, and become morose and intolerant?",
  "14465": "Wasn't the old fellow going to notice the skin?",
  "14466": "But where is the girl?",
  "14467": "What says the maid herself to going?",
  "14468": "What do you know about my feelings, eh?",
  "14469": "At what o'clock, sir, do you breakfast?",
  "14470": "Didn't I ask you to bring this lady a glass of lemonade?",
  "14471": "Is it possible to imagine a man near a brazier who is not warm?",
  "14472": "And could he take a foundling to his heart?",
  "14473": "Why should he doubt it?",
  "14474": "What have YOU got to do with it, then, if a person may inquire?",
  "14475": "And you can't say I've not been awfully good, can you?",
  "14476": "And later, when you returned to bring us aid, did we not see for ourselves how your friends poured after you?",
  "14477": "And the opinion of the inquisitors?",
  "14478": "Why so many to be low and so few to be high?",
  "14479": "But what is there in running across it like that?",
  "14480": "What do you want with me in town?",
  "14481": "Why, the soldier broke one, didn't he?",
  "14482": "What then, pray, is this, father?",
  "14483": "Do you want them to separate?",
  "14484": "Shall I be a cuckold, father, yea or no?",
  "14485": "What will twelve dollars do towards keeping up this flat?",
  "14486": "And who has told you what is bad for another man?",
  "14487": "The ship's boat?",
  "14488": "Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it?",
  "14489": "Do you know that she has lost her father?",
  "14490": "Was it you who killed the artillery sergeant?",
  "14491": "Why not try to find an opening in another direction from that which has so unfortunately failed?",
  "14492": "What shall I say?",
  "14493": "What do the gentlemen wish?",
  "14494": "What is he himself?",
  "14495": "What's it been reading?",
  "14496": "But, dearest, why do you keep on laughing?",
  "14497": "I cry in my sleep where is he?",
  "14498": "Can you explain to me what signify this leave of absence and this letter, which I have just received?",
  "14499": "Did he begin to waver under the delusion of a breath of adventure?",
  "14500": "What party, then, shall we choose among these difficulties?",
  "14501": "How unfortnet do you want me fur to be?",
  "14502": "And it is not pleasant?",
  "14503": "What do we live for, if it is not to make life less difficult to each other?",
  "14504": "And who now fills the seat of royalty?",
  "14505": "Does it not?",
  "14506": "Was it not simpler to adopt the agrarian law straightway?",
  "14507": "Was the murderer abroad on those nights?",
  "14508": "Did you fasten all the windows?",
  "14509": "Well, that of body too?",
  "14510": "Philip, how dare you shake me in this way?",
  "14511": "Would it have been just for me to send you letters and cause the fall of one who had been so bountiful to me?",
  "14512": "Fits?",
  "14513": "And was he not consequently damned?",
  "14514": "Then, I said, our guardians must lay the foundations of their fortress in music?",
  "14515": "Ain't it a pity?",
  "14516": "And do you really know all this?",
  "14517": "In what corner of the world shall I seek thy fellow?",
  "14518": "But are you not wounded?",
  "14519": "And best give you, by the same token, yours to be magnificent with her?",
  "14520": "Who was that child?",
  "14521": "Who says this?",
  "14522": "May I speak of something serious to you, for once in my life?",
  "14523": "Do I ask in vain?",
  "14524": "And why is the life of a modest woman a perpetual conflict?",
  "14525": "Well, what are they?",
  "14526": "What can I do for you, sir?",
  "14527": "Then what compels me to wait two days?",
  "14528": "Can you form a judgment as to what distance we are likely to be carried?",
  "14529": "Would you like to see?",
  "14530": "You mean, no doubt, that you do not deny that might is right?",
  "14531": "What's the matter with me, anyhow?",
  "14532": "Do you want to have us killed one by one to diminish our force, and put us at the mercy of these wretches?",
  "14533": "Wasn't I honest with you?",
  "14534": "For where was life to be found?",
  "14535": "Will you be so good as to tell your mistress I am here?",
  "14536": "Or at the casement seen her stand?",
  "14537": "Do you mean to see me again?",
  "14538": "It seems a good deal, don't it?",
  "14539": "D'you mean to say you've had nothing but a bottle of milk for the last three days?",
  "14540": "Not if she gave up marrying?",
  "14541": "What makes you think so?",
  "14542": "Then where to seek a proper protector for you against the confusion and chances of such a scene?",
  "14543": "Would it be unreasonable if those who have endured and achieved so much had now come home to rest?",
  "14544": "Why, sir, didn't you order me to marry her, and ain't I a good boy?",
  "14545": "Was it possible that the child was dead and was made alive again?",
  "14546": "How squares that story with thy present plea?",
  "14547": "Haven't you any forged letters to produce?",
  "14548": "Do you know a fish called the pompano?",
  "14549": "Can I believe him?",
  "14550": "Whenever I hit upon a good epithet, I back my luck, don't you see?",
  "14551": "What shame, inglorious if I quit the plain?",
  "14552": "Did that letter thoroughly explain my position and my views?",
  "14553": "With your own eyes?",
  "14554": "What have you got in it?",
  "14555": "Is it not important to know the exact position of affairs?",
  "14556": "How long was he?",
  "14557": "Shall it be a hard or a soft nib?",
  "14558": "Will you believe me?",
  "14559": "And how does he think it may be guarded against?",
  "14560": "What do you think is on his mind?",
  "14561": "What sort of a man was this I had to do with, and what schemes was he now revolving in his fearless mind?",
  "14562": "For what, sir?",
  "14563": "Yet from whom has not that rude hand rent away some dear connection?",
  "14564": "Do you really wish the bairn to go?",
  "14565": "On what charge do you arrest me?",
  "14566": "Why have schools?",
  "14567": "What were you saying?",
  "14568": "When had he a letter before that?",
  "14569": "But could manage them?",
  "14570": "They surely couldn't stop away more than a week, could they now?",
  "14571": "Will you honor your dead?",
  "14572": "Their situation?",
  "14573": "Where are you going to be married?",
  "14574": "Is he doing all right?",
  "14575": "Who had a son, had she not?",
  "14576": "You resist, do you?",
  "14577": "Yes, nobody minds them, so lark away, but don't get wild, will you?",
  "14578": "What then, discreet dame, is it that your mistress wants?",
  "14579": "What does the horrible creature mean?",
  "14580": "But you know where it is?",
  "14581": "If it is useful to go so far, may it not be much more useful to go still farther?",
  "14582": "And whom did that bold hussy think she could persuade to believe that?",
  "14583": "It is not possible, is it, to see a more perfect representation of annihilation?",
  "14584": "What did you do, then?",
  "14585": "What is it all?",
  "14586": "You are fond of gardening?",
  "14587": "But what does that matter?",
  "14588": "Where are they hiding?",
  "14589": "You would not be inclined to say, would you, that navigation is the art of medicine, at least if we are to adopt your exact use of language?",
  "14590": "What would the dear man have?",
  "14591": "Why should we ignore it now?",
  "14592": "Ye flee from me?",
  "14593": "And didn't I hear your message?",
  "14594": "But what if he should suffer the radish through obeying you, and be depillated with hot ashes?",
  "14595": "But where is the compass?",
  "14596": "And if the influence went with him into the tent, whose was it?",
  "14597": "Aren't we going too much to the left?",
  "14598": "Have you got a bit of good net, now?",
  "14599": "That's it, hey?",
  "14600": "Falsehoods?",
  "14601": "But tell me, how do the peasants look at it?",
  "14602": "Have you caught good poems?",
  "14603": "What have you just been saying, my friend?",
  "14604": "Can you tell us where he is?",
  "14605": "What is there to keep them together?",
  "14606": "A what?",
  "14607": "Do you suppose I don't see how you are suffering, how this has torn open your wounds?",
  "14608": "Is it just that she shall leave and pay no part of this herself?",
  "14609": "Do you mean I've been your victim?",
  "14610": "Wrong?",
  "14611": "What's that sir?",
  "14612": "Or while I continue to work at my picture, which will certainly never get finished?",
  "14613": "She has some recent association with the number twelve?",
  "14614": "This wound?",
  "14615": "But not all of it?",
  "14616": "How on earth can I dress up like that?",
  "14617": "So, you did see him when he was talking to you at the table?",
  "14618": "Was ever such a sneaking varmint?",
  "14619": "Is he gentle, father?",
  "14620": "What am I to tell you?",
  "14621": "You do not eat?",
  "14622": "Isn't the whole course of life made up of such?",
  "14623": "He was allying himself to science, for it was science but the absence of prejudice backed by the presence of money?",
  "14624": "Does he think me a ghost?",
  "14625": "Did she know of any place in the neighbourhood where a servant was wanted?",
  "14626": "And very good ones too, I believe, haven't they?",
  "14627": "Passed?",
  "14628": "You surely do not fancy that you can set them free?",
  "14629": "Who can tell it?",
  "14630": "Why will you persist in hopeless obstinacy?",
  "14631": "What did she do at my house?",
  "14632": "And what were the two lines?",
  "14633": "What should we do with this projected surplus?",
  "14634": "And yours?",
  "14635": "Walker, what is it?",
  "14636": "What are you going to do with that?",
  "14637": "What should we have to do?",
  "14638": "Have you no more to add?",
  "14639": "Then have you perceived that you say nothing to the purpose?",
  "14640": "Ye tremble at this word?",
  "14641": "Why has she done nothing to set things right?",
  "14642": "Who informed you this was the master I propose to you?",
  "14643": "Have you mentioned this death in your paper?",
  "14644": "How else could we live did the outer world not furnish our labour and our food?",
  "14645": "What were they to do?",
  "14646": "Work?",
  "14647": "And suppose we don't get her out of the house?",
  "14648": "How can I help it, if power like to walk on crooked legs?",
  "14649": "Wasn't I right to part with the horses?",
  "14650": "But if in my adventure I encounter aright, as I hope I will, shall I be fortunate?",
  "14651": "Where would I go to?",
  "14652": "Kit's there, is he?",
  "14653": "In what particulars?",
  "14654": "And your master, where is he?",
  "14655": "What have I to do with politics?",
  "14656": "And how far is it from looking to being, my good geographer?",
  "14657": "Is it unusual, unsophisticated, primitive?",
  "14658": "Isn't that a romantic name?",
  "14659": "Might we ask why there has been all this secrecy?",
  "14660": "What, is he gone unto my mother?",
  "14661": "Thy means of feeding?",
  "14662": "Oh, that was what you were saying as I came in?",
  "14663": "When did I first begin?",
  "14664": "Woan't yaw, my lad?",
  "14665": "Why, how so?",
  "14666": "Her heart simple and wilful as a bird's heart?",
  "14667": "What might the gentleman's name be, sir, that sent it?",
  "14668": "And is it worth tormenting oneself, when one has only a moment of life in comparison with eternity?",
  "14669": "May not something be done for her instant relief?",
  "14670": "Why do you spoil him like this?",
  "14671": "Then what has happened?",
  "14672": "Who knows?",
  "14673": "How dare you?",
  "14674": "But you care for such things?",
  "14675": "Who could give you stouter help in return for your own support?",
  "14676": "What acquirement exalts one being above another?",
  "14677": "Who would care to live in such a region?",
  "14678": "And her address?",
  "14679": "How, then, could he have heard the bell?",
  "14680": "Were they plotting against me?",
  "14681": "And to the odd is opposed the even?",
  "14682": "But what are you going to do with the hay?",
  "14683": "He has not been moved at all?",
  "14684": "Why isn't there any one to look after you?",
  "14685": "In heredity?",
  "14686": "And what is a man that he should not run with his brothers?",
  "14687": "And you really mean to stay by till that day comes?",
  "14688": "And when did mother die?",
  "14689": "And why glorious, my young friend?",
  "14690": "Are you going to get such and such a hat?",
  "14691": "Why train technicians?",
  "14692": "Why should we linger here?",
  "14693": "Do you think he is the devil, that so many of us should be afraid of him?",
  "14694": "What did she know?",
  "14695": "His father had just been trampled under foot and stamped upon in his presence, but by whom?",
  "14696": "And what is he to do?",
  "14697": "How do you think his majesty is affected?",
  "14698": "What experience have you had?",
  "14699": "Have you a sponge in your room?",
  "14700": "How can I look my husband in the face after this?",
  "14701": "You are looking for my daughter?",
  "14702": "Well, how is he now?",
  "14703": "Do you not see how he is trembling now?",
  "14704": "Why is the chestnut on the right?",
  "14705": "What judgment is he entitled to pass upon contemporary reformers?",
  "14706": "My father's?",
  "14707": "Do you oftentimes find your mind contemplating the wonders of creation and the glories of salvation?",
  "14708": "Am I a nasty, cruel, selfish, bad mama?",
  "14709": "Are they very theatrical people here?",
  "14710": "How could they continue to cherish expectations that were invariably doomed to disappointment?",
  "14711": "Do you take an interest in this affair?",
  "14712": "Did I?",
  "14713": "Have mankind treated me as a brother?",
  "14714": "How old is the others?",
  "14715": "Why should I trouble myself?",
  "14716": "Well, but you saw him, didn't you?",
  "14717": "Those chickens?",
  "14718": "Shan't you be glad to come and see us?",
  "14719": "Does any one do wrong?",
  "14720": "But are you not measured, then, when you give an order?",
  "14721": "To what court of appeal can we refer the conflicts which may arise when ultimate authorities disagree?",
  "14722": "I asked them why they did not themselves remain in their old homes?",
  "14723": "Did you tell him?",
  "14724": "Is it an island?",
  "14725": "Who says this?",
  "14726": "So placed that YOU have to arrange?",
  "14727": "If, then, for a common object this property is to be sacrificed, is it not just that it be done at a common charge?",
  "14728": "Is the quarrel of MY making?",
  "14729": "Any bad habits?",
  "14730": "What I wanted to tell you?",
  "14731": "Are you sure you have a good driver?",
  "14732": "Will you believe?",
  "14733": "What has he done to you?",
  "14734": "You haven't worked against me?",
  "14735": "And the body is more like the changing?",
  "14736": "Is this it?",
  "14737": "Well, it's a pity to cut the pie if you're not hungry, isn't it?",
  "14738": "But how did she go through it?",
  "14739": "What is it that you fear?",
  "14740": "Whither will you lead me?",
  "14741": "But how many generations of the women who had gone to her making had descended bandaged to the family vault?",
  "14742": "What am I to say to her?",
  "14743": "Have you been sick?",
  "14744": "Is he untidy?",
  "14745": "So we meet again, my travelling friend, do we?",
  "14746": "You don't admit that a woman is a social being?",
  "14747": "You won't be angry, will you?",
  "14748": "What dim forms are those on the ladder?",
  "14749": "And he doesn't lie?",
  "14750": "And what did I thrust my address upon her for?",
  "14751": "And when are you coming to me?",
  "14752": "Is my flesh brass?",
  "14753": "So he wrote that you were to bring me a copy of his confession, did he?",
  "14754": "But why, in the greater society or confederacy of mankind, should not the case be the same as in particular clubs and companies?",
  "14755": "How can it be supposed that he should be the only rich man in his dominions who is insensible to pleasures of this kind ?",
  "14756": "Hain't we got all the fools in town on our side?",
  "14757": "Can any picture be more dreadful than that?",
  "14758": "Did I keep it?",
  "14759": "Absolute idiots then?",
  "14760": "My dear, do you know that you are forgetting yourself altogether?",
  "14761": "They're in column, aren't they?",
  "14762": "Where is divine action here?",
  "14763": "Could his own conscience ever forgive him if he deserted her?",
  "14764": "Why SHOULD I go there?",
  "14765": "It bores you to be like other men?",
  "14766": "And when do you expect this to happen?",
  "14767": "Had he lost his power of scenting out catastrophes?",
  "14768": "The mountains?",
  "14769": "Might she not have feared that her appearance would, after a while, have failed to content you?",
  "14770": "What names are masculine?",
  "14771": "How like you this first exploit of his?",
  "14772": "Why didn't you show it to me?",
  "14773": "How came the wheel off?",
  "14774": "How now, what says the notary?",
  "14775": "What are your questions?",
  "14776": "Do you think it mercy to save the bird?",
  "14777": "What would there be left for us if we had not that?",
  "14778": "What do you mean by poor knight?",
  "14779": "One?",
  "14780": "And this gentleman, being disengaged, takes to the service willingly?",
  "14781": "Why was I not born in those happy times?",
  "14782": "Madam, don't you perceive it?",
  "14783": "Do you think I'll sit at home here and take your 'too busys' and 'can't come,' while you parade around and make out that I'm unable to come?",
  "14784": "Who could hurt him more than he had been hurt already?",
  "14785": "Does she love the bad?",
  "14786": "How is he succeeding?",
  "14787": "Don't you see, papa, that I get weaker, every day?",
  "14788": "You have seen our managers WALK BACKWARD?",
  "14789": "What's wrong?",
  "14790": "Cos'e?",
  "14791": "Can you tell me where?",
  "14792": "Haven't you had enough exercise for one day?",
  "14793": "Victor, when falsehood can look so like the truth, who can assure themselves of certain happiness?",
  "14794": "And the composition?",
  "14795": "Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless?",
  "14796": "Is that which can bend and turn, and descend and ascend, to fit every crooked phase of selfish, worldly society, religion?",
  "14797": "You will at least accept my gratitude?",
  "14798": "What's the reward for putting it back in the bundle as it was before?",
  "14799": "Ye can, can ye?",
  "14800": "What was their beauty to me in a few weeks?",
  "14801": "What is it they're so pleased with?",
  "14802": "But what is pure?",
  "14803": "You have a clue?",
  "14804": "Where were we going, and what were we to do?",
  "14805": "Might his life, if not saved, be prolonged for some days?",
  "14806": "What are you talking about?",
  "14807": "And yet what law divine have I transgressed?",
  "14808": "Do you forgive your enemies, and depart hence at peace with yourself and with mankind?",
  "14809": "What government, district, and parish?",
  "14810": "We knew that an enormous amount of weight could be saved, but how much?",
  "14811": "Was this, then, the end of his six years of unflagging devotion?",
  "14812": "Well, sir?",
  "14813": "What do these things mean?",
  "14814": "Did she call?",
  "14815": "Nothing WHATEVER?",
  "14816": "Is it like?",
  "14817": "Can I have unintentionally wounded my best comrade?",
  "14818": "Whence did I get it?",
  "14819": "What could we do with any theory which should leave them out of consideration?",
  "14820": "Do you say no?",
  "14821": "What had become of the agent himself?",
  "14822": "What was he like then, as a wrestler?",
  "14823": "Can you not carry your meat and your liquor decently?",
  "14824": "Your aunt, sir?",
  "14825": "Won't it do you good?",
  "14826": "Are you a materialist?",
  "14827": "Are his hands loose?",
  "14828": "How old were you when you came upon him in the little churchyard?",
  "14829": "Why ain't you at work?",
  "14830": "Should not the actual possessor be preferred to the evicted possessor?",
  "14831": "What was that sound?",
  "14832": "Won't you now?",
  "14833": "Wasn't it so?",
  "14834": "Why has she been removed?",
  "14835": "Does he see a ghost, or hear an organ?",
  "14836": "Why, who's got it?",
  "14837": "But what has it to do with me?",
  "14838": "Have they advanced his fortune, enlarged his knowledge, or reformed his conduct, to the degree that was once expected?",
  "14839": "But have you told me all?",
  "14840": "What are you talking of?",
  "14841": "How do you know it?",
  "14842": "Didn't you see those four runaways cry at the sight of her?",
  "14843": "How's the patient?",
  "14844": "Is it possible for the human mind to conceive of a more horrible state of society?",
  "14845": "Still, what can we do?",
  "14846": "Have the police come?",
  "14847": "What are we waiting for?",
  "14848": "Is it all over?",
  "14849": "ARE you going to marry her or not?",
  "14850": "And can force, in default of reason, alone introduce them into our laws?",
  "14851": "Do you think he will die?",
  "14852": "Why should I not take his part?",
  "14853": "Make up for what?",
  "14854": "The procureur?",
  "14855": "Ah, yes, where is my sister?",
  "14856": "And you mean to say the little thing is very fascinating, I suppose?",
  "14857": "All of whom will call one another citizens?",
  "14858": "And was that how it all ended?",
  "14859": "Perhaps you had better let me pay up, or they'll think we've run away?",
  "14860": "Where is the necessity of this hallucination?",
  "14861": "Ain't it yours too, father?",
  "14862": "Why should YOU take it on yourself?",
  "14863": "Am I like her?",
  "14864": "Is he to be compelled to do so?",
  "14865": "Again?",
  "14866": "You don't mean the infant phenomenon?",
  "14867": "But who ever reflects that, for certain boys, an unjust imposition may be as great a pang as the death of a friend in later years?",
  "14868": "Spirit, are they yours?",
  "14869": "What difference is it to you?",
  "14870": "Would you have voted what you felt and knew to be a lie?",
  "14871": "Was it climate?",
  "14872": "Who will be a father to him when I die?",
  "14873": "Was it to this splendid constellation in the patrician heaven that my obscure, portionless youth had dared to lift its presumptuous eyes?",
  "14874": "Did she ride the horse?",
  "14875": "Do you say so, miss?",
  "14876": "But, in the first place, how did he manage to enter the convent?",
  "14877": "Are they hoping with our help to triumph over their foes or to be useful to their friends?",
  "14878": "Who fears the fallen dew?",
  "14879": "What counterbalance?",
  "14880": "Why, you did nothing wrong?",
  "14881": "If you know, why don't you tell?",
  "14882": "Aren't you but fifteen?",
  "14883": "Will you permit me, then, to recall another to you?",
  "14884": "Where is your native isle?",
  "14885": "Why aren't you asleep, sir?",
  "14886": "You will not sell it, will you?",
  "14887": "My dearest girl, what is the matter?",
  "14888": "In what respect?",
  "14889": "Maylie?",
  "14890": "Why were the holy relics, the arms, ammunition, gunpowder, and stores of corn not removed?",
  "14891": "How long has he been away?",
  "14892": "And dogs are deteriorated in the good qualities of dogs, and not of horses?",
  "14893": "How do you know that it was the same fiacre?",
  "14894": "But to whom did you say them?",
  "14895": "What more could be desired by an enlightened and reasonable people?",
  "14896": "But if, now, a disaster were to happen?",
  "14897": "May not the darkness hide it from my face?",
  "14898": "Now, have a turn with me?",
  "14899": "And you do not guess it?",
  "14900": "Why can't I see in the dark?",
  "14901": "Placing my hand upon her shoulder I inquired if she had heard bad news that was grieving her?",
  "14902": "Will it never be day?",
  "14903": "O, then, you are in love with him?",
  "14904": "What sort of a face was I to draw?",
  "14905": "Can you believe so?",
  "14906": "Who made this man my master?",
  "14907": "Why should he have pardoned me, then?",
  "14908": "That is so, is it not?",
  "14909": "How has he got rich?",
  "14910": "What more of the man she had told them of before?",
  "14911": "What can all this mean?",
  "14912": "Of what use would it be?",
  "14913": "It's natural and right for 'em to talk different from each other, ain't it?",
  "14914": "Is it not then strange that thy intelligent part only should be disobedient and discontented with its own place?",
  "14915": "Which are the best coasts?",
  "14916": "You wish to join the colony?",
  "14917": "Was it not his betrothal feast?",
  "14918": "Are you not the precious image of each and all of us men in this whaling world?",
  "14919": "It don't take long, does it?",
  "14920": "Will you always stand that way and wait, until it'll becomes morning, noon, and evening?",
  "14921": "Now, you will go, won't you?",
  "14922": "May I ask the reason of your refusal?",
  "14923": "Does he know where I am, aunt?",
  "14924": "Have you anything?",
  "14925": "What liquor?",
  "14926": "Eh, how can I tell?",
  "14927": "What would he think himself?",
  "14928": "Did he understand too well, or did he not understand at all?",
  "14929": "When will you stop such romping ways?",
  "14930": "Who has not?",
  "14931": "Don't you think that any secret course is an unworthy one?",
  "14932": "And what have you been bringing here?",
  "14933": "Are the others clever, sir?",
  "14934": "Why should he run wild upon the moor?",
  "14935": "What they DO doesn't alter the truth of what they say, does it?",
  "14936": "Is it because it is his duty to be grateful?",
  "14937": "Have you put him to any ransom?",
  "14938": "Charlotte?",
  "14939": "What do you make of them?",
  "14940": "Would you be asking me to break my oath?",
  "14941": "Is there nothing I can do?",
  "14942": "Why don't you go home, then, same's me?",
  "14943": "What was this strange house?",
  "14944": "Do you not go with us?",
  "14945": "Think we're as green as to do you in here, and have the police nosing round?",
  "14946": "Taken in by the servant?",
  "14947": "What will become of us?",
  "14948": "D'you understand?",
  "14949": "And these researches?",
  "14950": "Is it some former admirer who wishes to retire?",
  "14951": "And you fancy that the two matters are connected in some way?",
  "14952": "You'll come with me, won't you?",
  "14953": "Your father, or brother, or your betrothed?",
  "14954": "When do you go, sir?",
  "14955": "What if the boy were really not her son, after all?",
  "14956": "Who are you, pray ?",
  "14957": "Well, granting that, what became of him?",
  "14958": "What put that idea in your head?",
  "14959": "Why did you not put your name to the note?",
  "14960": "He has been fairly in?",
  "14961": "Could you get me a part if I paid?",
  "14962": "What is the time now?",
  "14963": "Where do you go?",
  "14964": "Which lady?",
  "14965": "Oh, will you really?",
  "14966": "Who is the gentleman with the telescope?",
  "14967": "Why, indeed?",
  "14968": "That is his meaning then?",
  "14969": "And 'What will you take for the geese?",
  "14970": "Promise not to repeat?",
  "14971": "Are ye tuck sick, or what's come over ye?",
  "14972": "Tell me, why does a steward rob his master?",
  "14973": "Have you no regard for true merit, you malignant fellow?",
  "14974": "And last night he was with us so happy, so cheerful, so affectionate?",
  "14975": "It is not all a question of goods?",
  "14976": "Therefore is my freedom lawful, however proper it may be?",
  "14977": "Were they swept into eternity by a freshet?",
  "14978": "Besides, where was I to find a person to write the words, and one who would give himself the trouble of turning the poetry to my liking?",
  "14979": "Is it in any way different from other schools?",
  "14980": "And what harm if he did talk?",
  "14981": "Us, who have wings and fly?",
  "14982": "A grey mare?",
  "14983": "What effect had this frightful shock produced?",
  "14984": "And he acquiesced?",
  "14985": "So you would advise a knife to his throat?",
  "14986": "How dare you touch that coronet?",
  "14987": "Can't you make it eight?",
  "14988": "What has been decided?",
  "14989": "My dear girl, what have I got to do with her dressing beautifully or looking well?",
  "14990": "Are you speaking seriously, doctor?",
  "14991": "How could that be?",
  "14992": "My companions and myself?",
  "14993": "Do we breakfast or dine?",
  "14994": "Ought any, then, to refuse their aid in doing what good the good of the whole demands?",
  "14995": "Would the stranger one day speak of it?",
  "14996": "What may my father wish to convey?",
  "14997": "At the rate of, sir?",
  "14998": "When did you say he died?",
  "14999": "Well, when is her birthday?",
  "15000": "Is there any political power to authorize such interference?",
  "15001": "Now do you understand?",
  "15002": "And it was she, I presume, who mentioned your name?",
  "15003": "Is that where you live, my little lady?",
  "15004": "Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it?",
  "15005": "Where d' you live, sir?",
  "15006": "Are you come out as against a thief, with swords and staves to take me?",
  "15007": "Do you repent?",
  "15008": "Is the water always turbid?",
  "15009": "Was there nothing to be done?",
  "15010": "Say ye so?",
  "15011": "Well, what is it you really want of me?",
  "15012": "Who shall be the judge of merit?",
  "15013": "How now, nephew?",
  "15014": "Have I forgot my noble birth?",
  "15015": "Well, what shall you do with this money, count?",
  "15016": "Well, what are the names of the patriarchs?",
  "15017": "Have I clearly explained the class which I mean?",
  "15018": "Where can he have been hidden?",
  "15019": "Where did you bring him from?",
  "15020": "How can your lordship imagine that you could ever inconvenience me?",
  "15021": "How did you come here?",
  "15022": "I suppose he never knew me?",
  "15023": "Why did you drive me to such extremities?",
  "15024": "But why should such an idea cross your mind?",
  "15025": "A hundred and twenty talents?",
  "15026": "You couldn't take me, could you?",
  "15027": "But how are we to come by the men?",
  "15028": "What can I fear while shielded by protection at once so loving and so powerful?",
  "15029": "When was I in a fearful state?",
  "15030": "Shall I commit adultery?",
  "15031": "What has become of him?",
  "15032": "In that case, monseigneur, do you believe the cardinal will be so kind as to tell me what has become of my wife?",
  "15033": "Can he be sure that the two are necessarily in accord?",
  "15034": "Was there no mention made of me in the letter?",
  "15035": "Are not these beggarly devils sufficiently wretched already?",
  "15036": "Were you ever at sea, before?",
  "15037": "But what did you mean to take?",
  "15038": "Have strangers leave with us to get their wealth?",
  "15039": "If she bleeds to death, is that my fault?",
  "15040": "You are going to leave us after I have become so accustomed to you?",
  "15041": "Can it be done?",
  "15042": "Is she your child?",
  "15043": "What if by endeavouring to place her in the position of a lady, he had falsely so placed her, and robbed her of her legitimate position?",
  "15044": "Am I come to a friend?",
  "15045": "What befals him dead?",
  "15046": "Which way heading?",
  "15047": "Then what shall I gain, pray?",
  "15048": "How do you suppose you can carry on like this?",
  "15049": "Whose service would that be?",
  "15050": "What does all this flight of imagination mean?",
  "15051": "Vansuythen?",
  "15052": "What in the world do you s'pose that is?",
  "15053": "Is our little neighbor worse?",
  "15054": "Where have I been brought to?",
  "15055": "Nor the blue bed?",
  "15056": "My good sir, what is the matter with you, O father?",
  "15057": "How long will it be first?",
  "15058": "Why has she given up sending the children and coming to see us?",
  "15059": "Who is this?",
  "15060": "Is dat you, honey?",
  "15061": "Garth?",
  "15062": "Where do your brothers and sisters live?",
  "15063": "How can I take this stranger into my house?",
  "15064": "Then don't you know how it was?",
  "15065": "What did you do such a crazy thing as that for?",
  "15066": "Who is it you wish to see?",
  "15067": "Why is it that she speaks to him of about your welfare and your position, as she clearly has done?",
  "15068": "How will that do?",
  "15069": "But why shall I say more?",
  "15070": "I wonder if you will forgive me?",
  "15071": "But with what object?",
  "15072": "Where is the girl?",
  "15073": "You, too, booted and spurred?",
  "15074": "You imagined I didn't know you had your watch again?",
  "15075": "And what kind of woman, and of what age is she?",
  "15076": "Prunes?",
  "15077": "How came you to be there?",
  "15078": "And where might it be now?",
  "15079": "Now, how on earth could you know that the stolen silver was at the bottom of that pond?",
  "15080": "There are no villages here?",
  "15081": "What at?",
  "15082": "Something that you would like done, is it not?",
  "15083": "Was that all?",
  "15084": "Will you not let me look at it also?",
  "15085": "And are things in order?",
  "15086": "How about the fireplace?",
  "15087": "Why, what is the matter?",
  "15088": "And what did you say?",
  "15089": "Who is right and who is wrong?",
  "15090": "But if a man had a danger hanging over him, and knew what it was, don't you think he would turn to the police for protection?",
  "15091": "How did it show itself?",
  "15092": "When is this accomplished?",
  "15093": "And have you them yet?",
  "15094": "Did I take this yesterday?",
  "15095": "Will any private training enable him to stand firm against the overwhelming flood of popular opinion?",
  "15096": "Why would ye let such beauty wither?",
  "15097": "What may YOUR game be, ma'am?",
  "15098": "But what does it show?",
  "15099": "Or hear, except with the ear?",
  "15100": "Was it for this I condescended to take you to my bed, you poor, withered, sapless twig?",
  "15101": "What is the wind?",
  "15102": "It wasn't your fault so why should you mind?",
  "15103": "What must I answer?",
  "15104": "Is there any talk yet of who is to run?",
  "15105": "Must it be so?",
  "15106": "But what can we do?",
  "15107": "Why did you push yourself in there by daylight?",
  "15108": "And does not marriage mean motherhood?",
  "15109": "Don't you belong to the barricade?",
  "15110": "And what do you suppose the master will think when I display it before him?",
  "15111": "Hand over, will you?",
  "15112": "And think there was to you no conscience of the housebreaker, what would you do?",
  "15113": "What is it that you will not do?",
  "15114": "And whither go we, my father?",
  "15115": "What vault?",
  "15116": "By asking advice instead of exerting the judgment?",
  "15117": "Another one, eh?",
  "15118": "Who are they that carry it?",
  "15119": "For what can be the meaning of a truly wise man wanting to fly away and lightly leave a master who is better than himself?",
  "15120": "You think, probably, that I roam around, and get into all sorts of evil?",
  "15121": "Why weren't you at the races yesterday?",
  "15122": "But fly whither?",
  "15123": "May it be that I see you?",
  "15124": "Yes, count, you know what I told you?",
  "15125": "And what kind of a man?",
  "15126": "What have you killed a man for, you thief?",
  "15127": "Have you heard what has happened?",
  "15128": "Does the king exile me?",
  "15129": "And who is that pale young man beside him?",
  "15130": "Yes, isn't it, dear?",
  "15131": "What more need be said?",
  "15132": "Will no danger threaten him?",
  "15133": "How can you reconcile it to your conscience, I wonder, to prejudice my own boy against me, or against anybody who is dear to me?",
  "15134": "Nor of any other such person?",
  "15135": "Will your excellency deign to open it?",
  "15136": "Who amongst us is there that does not recollect similar hours of bitter, bitter childish grief?",
  "15137": "How could she be enamoured at once of nobleness and baseness, or at once desire and not desire one deed and the same?",
  "15138": "What had he really gained by all this trouble?",
  "15139": "And what was his reply?",
  "15140": "Shall I row you ashore?",
  "15141": "Have I been talking in my sleep?",
  "15142": "Where now?",
  "15143": "Who has not, a hundred times, found himself committing a vile or a silly action, for no other reason than because he knows he should not?",
  "15144": "The beginning or the end?",
  "15145": "Indeed, where could we stop?",
  "15146": "Wasn't it a lovely place?",
  "15147": "He is dead, is he not?",
  "15148": "The name of my clerk?",
  "15149": "Will you call for the money, or shall I send it?",
  "15150": "But how to get rid of him?",
  "15151": "Who's going?",
  "15152": "How is the queen?",
  "15153": "So you refuse my request?",
  "15154": "You wonder what?",
  "15155": "And who is that other person?",
  "15156": "Rheumatism, sir?",
  "15157": "Am I my brother's keeper?",
  "15158": "What do you mean by early?",
  "15159": "Would they be likely to get rid of seven men out of eight from their own gang and retain only the eighth man?",
  "15160": "You will go to the city and make money, eh?",
  "15161": "Do you think he had planned this robbery, when he went with you to the lodging?",
  "15162": "O, is your bundle ready?",
  "15163": "Real friends?",
  "15164": "Will you never get on to your job?",
  "15165": "And about what?",
  "15166": "You owe her her wages, I suppose?",
  "15167": "Do you know what you have said?",
  "15168": "Balderstone?",
  "15169": "I am having a room got ready for you here, and will you please come round at once on getting this?",
  "15170": "But we owe something in this house?",
  "15171": "And what about afterwards?",
  "15172": "But where will we be tomorrow?",
  "15173": "What advice?",
  "15174": "Who told her?",
  "15175": "Remarkable for what?",
  "15176": "Is it not what happens to every one?",
  "15177": "But how is it she does not think of it herself?",
  "15178": "Who may it be for?",
  "15179": "I say, laddie, you don't object if I sing slightly from time to time during the journey?",
  "15180": "What makes you weep, mama?",
  "15181": "Where is his office?",
  "15182": "What do you mean by that question?",
  "15183": "If this is the great evil of being alone, then what is good and what is evil?",
  "15184": "Have you any arms?",
  "15185": "Are they in possession of our letters?",
  "15186": "Do you observe this gallery, or rather lobby, indeed?",
  "15187": "When will you do that?",
  "15188": "And will not the words and the character of the style depend on the temper of the soul?",
  "15189": "Do you not think that it would be regrettable if we had met in vain?",
  "15190": "Why did she come?",
  "15191": "Is it not safe e'en to encounter him?",
  "15192": "Did any haberdasher ever look so smirking?",
  "15193": "But what degree of intensity will overbalance what period of duration?",
  "15194": "Couldn't we enlarge it, hollow it out, make openings to let in light and air?",
  "15195": "How can I desire children?",
  "15196": "Would I only come and look at the range?",
  "15197": "What is the prisoner's name?",
  "15198": "Well, hasn't it made it exactly what we wanted?",
  "15199": "How can there be any secrecy, when everything is known to all of us?",
  "15200": "You won't carry me off in your bags, will ye, master?",
  "15201": "Where is your master's diocese?",
  "15202": "Why did he so?",
  "15203": "What was it, my own mother?",
  "15204": "What's the matter with white men?",
  "15205": "But when you held her in your power, why did you not drown her, strangle her, hang her?",
  "15206": "But by whom will Z be paid for the loss caused him by the profit charged by A in the beginning?",
  "15207": "Perhaps, sir, you don't like the ship?",
  "15208": "Do you think I'd let him imagine for a minute that anything he said could influence me in my public duty?",
  "15209": "Is she safe?",
  "15210": "Have I offended you?",
  "15211": "Then you are on guard every day?",
  "15212": "But this castle, then?",
  "15213": "You know him, then?",
  "15214": "What, said he, I wonder, will the good old couple say to it?",
  "15215": "My hand?",
  "15216": "You consider it, then, perfectly unworthy of a woman to love a man who does not adore her?",
  "15217": "Why are you upset?",
  "15218": "Have you anything to ask of me?",
  "15219": "I've accepted your dismissal, and you managed it as cruelly as you could, and I have made you respect my sex, haven't I?",
  "15220": "What must I do?",
  "15221": "You have formed some conclusion?",
  "15222": "Was not the observation of the chief only what might have been expected?",
  "15223": "What right have I to betray the confidence reposed in me, when nothing but a miracle can prevent this sacrifice?",
  "15224": "But how many passions have amalgamated to form that hatred?",
  "15225": "Can't you be generous and unselfish enough to face whatever trial there may be for you in this bit of a coincidence?",
  "15226": "How did she come there?",
  "15227": "Now, don't you think the lad would be handsomer cropped?",

  "16031": "Shall I read aloud?",
  "16032": "Have they any will?",
  "16033": "Did our talk in the afternoon have something to do with it?",
  "16034": "What shall I do, then?",
  "16035": "You see this toothpick?",
  "16036": "You would like a glass of lemonade, sir?",
  "16037": "Do you want the tuileries?",
  "16038": "What was their sole remaining chance?",
  "16039": "Well, what does your instinct tell you now?",
  "16040": "There is no possibility of any mistake on your part, my boy, is there?",
  "16041": "Do you think I can wait when business is in question?",
  "16042": "Is your profession really so engaging and interesting as to absorb your whole attention?",
  "16043": "How do you do, sir?",
  "16044": "Why couldn't we have waited?",
  "16045": "Shivering?",
  "16046": "Did she, too, pine for the lost rank, or rather mourn the lost lover?",
  "16047": "Perhaps you are his spirit come to revisit your old home?",
  "16048": "Is the young lady not with her aunt, after all?",
  "16049": "Why had these men come back after having returned to the camp?",
  "16050": "Has he come?",
  "16051": "But how does my sweet girl?",
  "16052": "Do you know what passed when I took him aside?",
  "16053": "Ah, how do you do, my dear prince?",
  "16054": "Of what do you complain?",
  "16055": "What if there WAS some one concealed in the house?",
  "16056": "You are her grandfather, that is?",
  "16057": "And in what way do you think you could be of use to me?",
  "16058": "Weren't you awfully frightened?",
  "16059": "Who is to be master of the world?",
  "16060": "Has she, indeed?",
  "16061": "Laziness?",
  "16062": "You'll take me, won't you?",
  "16063": "Was it I who wanted to take the road to the right on top of the hill, insisting that I recognized the road?",
  "16064": "If so, if she had been wrong to accede to that offer when made, would she not be doubly wrong to hold him to it now that she saw his error?",
  "16065": "Say?",
  "16066": "Do you understand this?",
  "16067": "Wouldn't it be pretty?",
  "16068": "Then you will come and dine with me?",
  "16069": "Why did you not pull the church to pieces, and bring the chandelier home with you?",
  "16070": "How was it you so suddenly popped up in front of me as you did?",
  "16071": "Why do you insult me by telling me all this?",
  "16072": "What woman?",
  "16073": "Why does not he run?",
  "16074": "What could have passed between the two, what ailed the man?",
  "16075": "Or was I so worthless as to have grown tired of her pure society?",
  "16076": "And CONTIN?",
  "16077": "All well?",
  "16078": "A fine fellow, is he not?",
  "16079": "What is that, grandmother?",
  "16080": "How would he feel when he met her again, in her poor ruined home?",
  "16081": "Well, now, gentlemen, is not that very alarming?",
  "16082": "What then became of me?",
  "16083": "How no rent?",
  "16084": "You sleep in this room, then?",
  "16085": "Where did you hide it?",
  "16086": "And have women, who have early imbibed notions of passive obedience, sufficient character to manage a family or educate children?",
  "16087": "Do you know her name?",
  "16088": "But wouldn't the shot be heard at the inn or somewhere?",
  "16089": "But suppose we HAD gone through the ceremony?",
  "16090": "Was this to be endured?",
  "16091": "Are you, indeed, going there?",
  "16092": "Well, is she there?",
  "16093": "Do you know will he be long, sir?",
  "16094": "Which side ought he to take?",
  "16095": "You were guarding me?",
  "16096": "Can he praestare fidem datam?",
  "16097": "Of monuments?",
  "16098": "Would she not tell you?",
  "16099": "Is it man or beast?",
  "16100": "Do you fly?",
  "16101": "What do you want among us now?",
  "16102": "Shall I respect man when he condemns me?",
  "16103": "What is he doing?",
  "16104": "What shall I put you down for?",
  "16105": "Or what?",
  "16106": "What is your badge?",
  "16107": "And when the body is hungry, against eating?",
  "16108": "Is anything in me changed at all?",
  "16109": "What call?",
  "16110": "Perhaps it will be just the same to him if you don't?",
  "16111": "Upon what, sire?",
  "16112": "And now what are you going to do about it?",
  "16113": "But when do you expect to go?",
  "16114": "Are you in pain?",
  "16115": "Why don't you answer?",
  "16116": "Can you not tell when a warning is for your own good?",
  "16117": "And who can have done it but I?",
  "16118": "Well, sir, is not a substitute clothed with all the power and dignity of him who grants the commission?",
  "16119": "Are we not, sir?",
  "16120": "How should the individual choose his satisfactions?",
  "16121": "And who has filled your head with all this nonsense?",
  "16122": "You got your mother's letter?",
  "16123": "This looks well, eh?",
  "16124": "Well, and how are you my buck?",
  "16125": "Was not an early death his certain fate?",
  "16126": "And how did you manage to make them so grand, exalted, and brave with your wonderful verse?",
  "16127": "You wish to know what I will do?",
  "16128": "Tell me, at least, who you are?",
  "16129": "What shall be our excuse with the king?",
  "16130": "But is this really so?",
  "16131": "Have I called you down from the stars?",
  "16132": "For how much?",
  "16133": "But what do you want with me?",
  "16134": "Is not that quite enough?",
  "16135": "Say he need not lose his children and his wife, will he love you for that more than one who knows he well deserved the loss?",
  "16136": "Or had it transformed itself into this man, and what did the whole thing mean?",
  "16137": "Do you know anything of the commissionnaire?",
  "16138": "Through marriage?",
  "16139": "And do you impute it to either of those?",
  "16140": "Is she not perhaps still a married woman with a living husband?",
  "16141": "Is there never another to be found in the world?",
  "16142": "What's that, captain?",
  "16143": "Well, said he, have you considered my proposals?",
  "16144": "Did you ever spend a quieter night in our little house at Königsberg?",
  "16145": "In nailing up the coffin?",
  "16146": "Have you enough till I come back?",
  "16147": "Are they better than gold pieces?",
  "16148": "Wel, what of him?",
  "16149": "Why all these complaints?",
  "16150": "If he does not boast of his deeds, who will?",
  "16151": "I am only asking you, is it worth it?",
  "16152": "Tom, have you anything to tell me?",
  "16153": "A gift?",
  "16154": "Blood is thicker than water, isn't it?",
  "16155": "But, my dear, will you not give us a little hope of touching this heart, so kind and generous?",
  "16156": "An't you?",
  "16157": "Then why do you keep thinking about it?",
  "16158": "What's the use of talking?",
  "16159": "Has he?",
  "16160": "Aren't you ashamed of yourself?",
  "16161": "What say you then?",
  "16162": "Do you reflect that all those words will be branded in my memory, and eating deeper eternally after you have left me?",
  "16163": "What example?",
  "16164": "Do you know him personally?",
  "16165": "You cannot mean to shoot me?",
  "16166": "Why does he never write?",
  "16167": "What do girls do who haven't any mothers to help them through their troubles?",
  "16168": "I don't know what you mean?",
  "16169": "Are they not a race contemptuous of others?",
  "16170": "Why did she seem so abstracted?",
  "16171": "The pony?",
  "16172": "What men be ye?",
  "16173": "The short and long of it is, men, will ye spit fire or not?",
  "16174": "Who had done this?",
  "16175": "Are we, then, speeding forward to some cataract which will cast us down an abyss?",
  "16176": "Monsieur d'Artagnan?",
  "16177": "For their soul?",
  "16178": "Why do you not go to the inn?",
  "16179": "But tell me, whence comes this fortune?",
  "16180": "What'll we do?",
  "16181": "Mamma, from whom was that other letter which you got this morning?",
  "16182": "Which one of you knows whether I have said it or no?",
  "16183": "Has she ever seen you before?",
  "16184": "Whose heart, for all thy wiles, is ever pure?",
  "16185": "What do they matter to us?",
  "16186": "Must I be subject to this merciless villain?",
  "16187": "Don't you imagine he would make a better soup?",
  "16188": "Is your roaguery become an office, with a knaues name?",
  "16189": "Did you expect me to believe you, princess?",
  "16190": "Would you seriously object to my bringing the child over here, with its mother?",
  "16191": "He doesn't show violence, does he?",
  "16192": "You've not forgotten all your doctoring, have you?",
  "16193": "How could you see her suffering and allow it to continue?",
  "16194": "What will happen if she is guilty?",
  "16195": "You wouldn't relapse, if you were going out?",
  "16196": "Ah, is there a secret spring?",
  "16197": "Had a tribe of wandering blacks passed that way lately?",
  "16198": "How did you get such a wee wee waist?",
  "16199": "Can't you pull the lever over faster?",

  "16201": "Turn them over to the captain?",
  "16202": "Job?",
  "16203": "You plie this geere?",
  "16204": "Only tell me, where is she now?",
  "16205": "Why ain't you at home?",
  "16206": "The hansom cab one?",
  "16207": "Did you go far?",
  "16208": "To whom are you referring?",
  "16209": "Shall I tell you how bad a place it is to pass?",
  "16210": "Has he sent no particular message for me?",

  "16212": "Shan't I give you a piece of anything at all, miss?",
  "16213": "May it be told?",
  "16214": "On this rock?",
  "16215": "But the marks?",
  "16216": "Why should he not declare himself, or at least try to find some encouragement?",

  "18414": "Well, what do you think?",
  "18415": "Where was he born?",
  "18416": "What did you say?",
  "18417": "You bring me news, do you say?",
  "18418": "Shall I, in cool blood, set loose upon the earth a daemon whose delight is in death and wretchedness?",
  "18419": "Then what do you call the people with whom they're now having tea?",
  "18420": "And why do we need refreshment, my friends?",
  "18421": "And after all, what do we know of ourselves?",
  "18422": "Was it not probable that these symptoms would increase indefinitely, or at least until terminated by death itself?",
  "18423": "Had he not always been sufficient to himself, and now, at fifty, was it likely that he should trust another?",
  "18424": "Shall I see you again soon?",
  "18425": "Who can draw a strict line of demarcation between mind and body?",
  "18426": "Were there two?",
  "18427": "Are people so unhappy when they love?",
  "18428": "What is your object in speaking to me of this?",
  "18429": "On which side?",
  "18430": "Is he not, comte?",
  "18431": "Feel less thirsty after wetting your throat?",
  "18432": "He is, then, I suppose, the prince's jailer?",
  "18433": "Bends he his steps in our direction, child?",
  "18434": "We should be more cosy, shouldn't we?",
  "18435": "And this is your establishment?",
  "18436": "What are you saying, monsieur?",
  "18437": "Do you believe in heredity?",
  "18438": "Who will make the law?",
  "18439": "Why, are you a doctor, prince, or what?",
  "18440": "Not for long, surely?",
  "18441": "How could she get that?",
  "18442": "Are you acquainted with her?",
  "18443": "Haven't you heard of him?",
  "18444": "Hasn't it kept me and mine for years?",
  "18445": "About what, mama?",
  "18446": "Then what has become of the mummy?",
  "18447": "Mama, how can you sit and hear such statements?",
  "18448": "How can you ask?",
  "18449": "What had she done to excite the malice of an enemy?",
  "18450": "It isn't going to take you out of your way?",
  "18451": "You do not love me, then?",
  "18452": "Where have you come from, my dear count?",
  "18453": "Why are ye sitting here?",
  "18454": "Why then, as I perused them, did the hairs of my head erect themselves on end, and the blood of my body become congealed within my veins?",
  "18455": "And will you not so much honour me and so help me as to read it for me?",
  "18456": "And I shall not see her before you start?",
  "18457": "Or is his gravity only in appearance?",
  "18458": "How can that be done?",
  "18459": "How can we keep company with you?",
  "18460": "Oliver, what's the news?",
  "18461": "Are you?",
  "18462": "If we come soon can you go a piece wid us?",
  "18463": "What rank did he hold on board?",
  "18464": "Do I show it?",
  "18465": "Tilda HAS won something she didn't expect, I think, haven't you, dear?",
  "18466": "What will but felt the fleshly screen?",
  "18467": "If a superior man abandon virtue, how can he fulfil the requirements of that name?",
  "18468": "Hopes hovering in the near future as well as sorrows born of the past?",
  "18469": "Qu'est ce qu'un chancelier?",
  "18470": "You won't speak to me about it, my dear?",
  "18471": "But what ails you, father?",
  "18472": "Where are you going, wife?",
  "18473": "On business?",
  "18474": "Do you smell this little marsh?",
  "18475": "And reasoning is peculiarly his instrument?",
  "18476": "How the devil is one to get the intention of the soul except by painting exactly what one sees?",
  "18477": "None of my knaves there?",
  "18478": "Have you been waiting long?",
  "18479": "It's true they are innocent, isn't it?",
  "18480": "Or evil expectations?",
  "18481": "By the way, papa, where do you make the explosives?",
  "18482": "But who is this that breaks upon me?",
  "18483": "Why do you shout so?",
  "18484": "What must I promise?",
  "18485": "And you have accepted him?",
  "18486": "And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?",
  "18487": "Do you mean the bo'sun?",
  "18488": "To its address, my lord?",
  "18489": "What made you think it was she?",
  "18490": "What shall I say, madam?",
  "18491": "I believe I've only had the honour of seeing you once myself?",
  "18492": "I told him, and he was attentive until I had finished, and then burst out laughing again, and asked me if I was sore afterwards?",
  "18493": "Has the proud young lady gone?",
  "18494": "And did you also discover a bitter taste?",
  "18495": "You don't believe in having any standard of behaviour at all, do you?",
  "18496": "Should he find that place in this city if he could get there?",
  "18497": "Must I give up my place to your eminence, or shall I continue?",
  "18498": "Shall I be fatal to your happiness?",
  "18499": "Then why not come to it?",
  "18500": "Who in the dance so fleet?",
  "18501": "What are you reading now?",
  "18502": "You saw the captain?",
  "18503": "What say you to that?",
  "18504": "If the question is put, why do men desire to deposit their life outside their bodies?",
  "18505": "Well, but shall we not meet again?",
  "18506": "When you said that, did you mean that it seemed to you to be louder than the second one?",
  "18507": "We are almost drowned here amongst these lettuce, shall we speak?",
  "18508": "But it is long ago?",
  "18509": "How can I explain that infatuation?",
  "18510": "Well, what did he say about me?",
  "18511": "If it is my name I must have it, mustn't I?",
  "18512": "Are they boys?",
  "18513": "Do you affirm that?",
  "18514": "And who is to pursue him?",
  "18515": "Are you really sad?",
  "18516": "And where are your sisters?",
  "18517": "Well, what have you got to say to me?",
  "18518": "Has there been any inconsistency on his side to create alarm?",
  "18519": "Didn't the people laugh?",
  "18520": "How does it differ from soul?",
  "18521": "And what effect did this discourse produce?",
  "18522": "Rather a good marriage this, I believe?",
  "18523": "Which way is not despair?",
  "18524": "And what brings you up here under somebody else's name?",
  "18525": "May it not be that the utopists find it easier to expatiate upon these grand words than to seriously study social manifestations?",
  "18526": "Are you looking for anything?",
  "18527": "Did she perform any ceremony befitting it, or what did she do?",
  "18528": "Let me see, what harvest shall we have?",
  "18529": "To us forever are the gates of heaven shut, for who shall open them to us again?",
  "18530": "And now what is to be done?",
  "18531": "You say that she must have come back this way?",
  "18532": "There, NOW do you understand?",
  "18533": "What is the matter with you, you fool?",
  "18534": "Could he trust himself to come down to breakfast a free man in the morning?",
  "18535": "Could she make that sacrifice?",
  "18536": "Now, what in the world ailed the creature?",
  "18537": "Will they never bring that emetic?",
  "18538": "What have we to do?",
  "18539": "He did not marry this accomplished young lady?",
  "18540": "Who says man and wife are bad company?",
  "18541": "Who is to dance?",
  "18542": "That's all you know of him?",
  "18543": "But what business had rushes there, or I among them?",
  "18544": "If they don't stop, why should I?",
  "18545": "Why shouldn't they put 'em up and sell 'em by auction to men who are in need of such articles?",
  "18546": "And in what part of it?",
  "18547": "What have you been doing since I last saw you?",
  "18548": "Have I killed anyone, or insulted or wished harm to anyone?",
  "18549": "Did she suffer from heart complaint?",
  "18550": "Could you come?",
  "18551": "Don't that seem strange?",
  "18552": "Where are these papers, then?",
  "18553": "Yes, but where's your special world?",
  "18554": "Shall you not need an instrument similar to the one which you used yesterday?",
  "18555": "And you've no security?",
  "18556": "And you were his comfort through everything?",
  "18557": "But will he then live for ever?",
  "18558": "Where bend unseen thy trackless course?",
  "18559": "When is it likely to come to an end?",
  "18560": "In which, sir?",
  "18561": "At school?",
  "18562": "Greshamsbury?",
  "18563": "Shall I repent of it?",
  "18564": "And do well, I am sure?",
  "18565": "Who brought me here?",
  "18566": "But fortitude presupposes strength of mind, and is strength of mind to be acquired by indolent acquiescence?",
  "18567": "To what extent?",
  "18568": "That's the problem, isn't it?",
  "18569": "But whom send I to judge them?",
  "18570": "Now I am sure that you would not be too proud to earn the price of a new dress, would you?",
  "18571": "Where is the key?",
  "18572": "Shall we go together?",
  "18573": "What cable?",
  "18574": "Does he make any conditions?",
  "18575": "Does he say the quotations from his own speech are forgeries?",
  "18576": "Was it a sarpent?",
  "18577": "And asking your pardon, is it you's the man killed his father?",
  "18578": "In different states shall the magistrates be different or the same?",
  "18579": "May not my love, my life, my duty, try to repay the confidence you have shown me?",
  "18580": "You want a pretext, do you not?",
  "18581": "What would the enemy say?",
  "18582": "To whom do you desire to leave this fortune?",
  "18583": "Have you anything to say at all?",
  "18584": "Was this credible?",
  "18585": "But tell me, is it a civilized country?",
  "18586": "Can't ye never keep things sep'rate?",
  "18587": "Did you never hear that?",
  "18588": "You mean when money is not wanted, but allowed to lie?",
  "18589": "Perhaps you cannot talk now?",
  "18590": "What do you intend?",
  "18591": "Or do you decline and dissent from this?",
  "18592": "And we have lost an opportunity to get back to our country?",
  "18593": "Why shouldn't he?",
  "18594": "What, mother?",
  "18595": "And what's this?",
  "18596": "How could you mistake me so?",
  "18597": "What is the matter, gentlemen?",
  "18598": "Are you very tired?",
  "18599": "Are we softened a little?",
  "18600": "How are you getting on with your woman?",
  "18601": "Socrates, what do you mean?",
  "18602": "Six children, sir?",
  "18603": "D'you mean to say you can look at the painting of that flesh and say it's not good?",
  "18604": "Are you not ashamed of yourself?",
  "18605": "Isn't it beastly?",
  "18606": "Does she know where he has gone to?",
  "18607": "Why wouldn't you go?",
  "18608": "No friends?",
  "18609": "I suppose he has money, hasn't he?",
  "18610": "Are they yoked?",
  "18611": "Besides, why should I die?",
  "18612": "How should the bells be rung?",
  "18613": "What sort of a lady is she?",
  "18614": "But am I to remain always alone in this vast and dismal chamber?",
  "18615": "Do you know she is a very virtuous woman?",
  "18616": "Canst drink the waters of the crisped spring?",
  "18617": "Do you see that black thing at the end of the field?",
  "18618": "What's that you've got?",
  "18619": "What is the difference?",
  "18620": "Will you look at them?",
  "18621": "How shall the mother summon courage to bid him adieu?",
  "18622": "What sort of night was it?",
  "18623": "Your younger sisters must be very young?",
  "18624": "So soon as that?",
  "18625": "My dear, how am I to say?",
  "18626": "Why, what would you do with them?",
  "18627": "And after all, what did it matter to me, and why did it matter to me?",
  "18628": "But, if you love me you would like me to be your husband?",
  "18629": "And their names?",
  "18630": "Why did you not ask for me at my room if you were in the hotel?",
  "18631": "Ilyin?",
  "18632": "Then where's thy husband?",
  "18633": "Had he been dreaming?",
  "18634": "MacCallum who, sir?",
  "18635": "Why deprive myself of the actual charm of my enjoyments to inform others what I enjoyed?",
  "18636": "My hay for the district?",
  "18637": "What is your proposal?",
  "18638": "What about your master?",
  "18639": "And then you heard nothing until you read the reports of the death in the paper?",
  "18640": "How, go then?",
  "18641": "And have not you inquired?",
  "18642": "Is he ALWAYS hungry?",
  "18643": "Are you sure it was me?",
  "18644": "Why not history?",
  "18645": "Why do you ask such an unnecessary question?",
  "18646": "Who were his parents?",
  "18647": "Are you tired?",
  "18648": "Come to see the old man, hay?",
  "18649": "We have the resources, but are we fully ready to use them?",
  "18650": "What shall I do to him, sahib?",
  "18651": "Do you wish to come in?",
  "18652": "Pray, how came you to know that men were formerly fools?",
  "18653": "Does he suppose him capable of having killed our horses and bullocks?",
  "18654": "Oh, is this true what you say?",
  "18655": "You call THAT something to lend?",
  "18656": "Shall we condescend to legislate on any of these particulars?",
  "18657": "Meanwhile, what are you going to do?",
  "18658": "But where was his mind?",
  "18659": "And the matter seems serious to you?",
  "18660": "What's sov'rin, and what's c'u'nity?",
  "18661": "What is it that once or twice they have quarreled with the governor, and because they would not yield have been proclaimed?",
  "18662": "How do you find yourself today?",
  "18663": "When would they return, and how?",
  "18664": "What business had he to talk to her about being taken away from uncles and aunts?",
  "18665": "What is there in the tents?",
  "18666": "Where were you going now?",
  "18667": "His blankets?",
  "18668": "Why not let me take a farm?",
  "18669": "Dare you answer me thus?",
  "18670": "Do they tell the young warriors that the pale faces met the red men, painted for war and armed with the stone hatchet and wooden gun?",
  "18671": "Why, but do you speak this seriously?",
  "18672": "You have nothing else to tell us?",
  "18673": "Could it have lived an hour as happily?",
  "18674": "Would it degrade me as much as to break my faith with the helpless?",
  "18675": "Whom will you send for?",
  "18676": "Now, could she do it?",
  "18677": "All safe inside?",
  "18678": "Well, boys, how does it feel to be in space once more?",
  "18679": "What do you mean by making such a racket?",
  "18680": "But if I accept the appointment, and yet disagree with the bishop, what then?",
  "18681": "Where should she live?",
  "18682": "Have I not tended that dear couch for years?",
  "18683": "Are we not as much so as you?",
  "18684": "Will you meet me there?",
  "18685": "What have I to do, to free myself for ever of your visits, but to abandon you to your deserts?",
  "18686": "What could be the meaning of it?",
  "18687": "Good news, then?",
  "18688": "Did he not come to burn their pillared temples and offerings and precincts and shatter our laws?",
  "18689": "What is it called, dear guardian?",
  "18690": "Two leagues beyond the summit of the hill?",
  "18691": "Whose for choice?",
  "18692": "Has the rain wrecked the road?",
  "18693": "Why the devil don't you get out of the way?",
  "18694": "I ask you now, is such a theory tenable?",
  "18695": "How are you feeling this morning?",
  "18696": "Canoeing?",
  "18697": "How would it be from now on?",
  "18698": "How could he, poor boy?",
  "18699": "Well, on the road itself?",
  "18700": "And how should he know them?",
  "18701": "You will do all you can do, your excellency?",
  "18702": "Where was I?",
  "18703": "Is that your opinion, D'Herblay?",
  "18704": "Into what room did you take him?",
  "18705": "He hesitated to give it to you?",
  "18706": "Or is it only your good luck?",
  "18707": "Was it in that year that the man appeared, sir?",
  "18708": "D'ye say so?",
  "18709": "Where and when?",
  "18710": "But you don't believe that he will make fire?",
  "18711": "What do you expect me to do?",
  "18712": "Don't you think he's charming?",
  "18713": "What's de matter?",
  "18714": "Much here else?",
  "18715": "Do you think it will be long before he comes in?",
  "18716": "The father's?",
  "18717": "Did he not lunch with you, cousin?",
  "18718": "Of what, mamma?",
  "18719": "Shall I?",
  "18720": "Who will marry such a one?",
  "18721": "Ariosto?",
  "18722": "Shall I tell him of your gratitude?",
  "18723": "How came you to be awake?",
  "18724": "What is it we're going to see?",
  "18725": "Would you like to go into the parlor?",
  "18726": "While his soul had passed from ecstasy to languor where had she been?",
  "18727": "Aint dis here my lef eye for sartain?",
  "18728": "What does it matter whether he does or not?",
  "18729": "Is this nothing?",
  "18730": "Whither go you now?",
  "18731": "Moliere?",
  "18732": "I think only one of your rooms is engaged as yet, is it not?",
  "18733": "Should I not desire its prosperity and its happiness?",
  "18734": "And from what country?",
  "18735": "How did he look?",
  "18736": "Will you be more happy at home?",
  "18737": "What is it, deary?",
  "18738": "But, after all, in order to see, the light must exceed the darkness, and in the midst of the darkness in the water, how can you see?",
  "18739": "Do her friends know my story also?",
  "18740": "You refuse to answer?",
  "18741": "To send a gentleman after him?",
  "18742": "Get over what?",
  "18743": "What have you got to do?",
  "18744": "Was it?",
  "18745": "Does your excellency happen to be hungry?",
  "18746": "Can two passengers in yonder street be more unlike each other than the soul is to the soul after an interval of twenty years?",
  "18747": "Take care of yourself, won't you?",
  "18748": "A boat?",
  "18749": "What do the people want this time?",
  "18750": "Is he going to make it manslaughter, or what's he going to make of it?",
  "18751": "And even to this are there not exceptions?",
  "18752": "Do you never search your heart and shudder at the horrible degradation which you have brought on yourself by sheer weakness of will?",
  "18753": "I am to remain minister, then?",
  "18754": "In a year?",
  "18755": "What does her clever stepfather do then?",
  "18756": "What story can I invent?",
  "18757": "Have you not managed to get out of it?",
  "18758": "Veteran, you must have been often wounded?",
  "18759": "He had a son, it seems?",
  "18760": "You're there, are you?",
  "18761": "Who is your district ruler?",
  "18762": "What have they to show for their famous conservatories?",
  "18763": "Offensively so?",
  "18764": "Where shall we put it?",
  "18765": "How have you come to know of this?",
  "18766": "Had they tried to get a doctor?",
  "18767": "Where do they get the feathers?",
  "18768": "I hope your father is quite well?",

  "18773": "Do you prefer reading to cards?",
  "18774": "Stay, who nurses him?",
  "18775": "Shall we excuse the desertion of his standard, a treacherous desertion which abandoned the victory to the enemies of his benefactor?",
  "18776": "Will you not answer?",
  "18777": "But what name?",
  "18778": "Did I see it?",
  "18779": "Have you not then told me that you loved me?",

  "18803": "Alektryaina?",
  "18804": "And what will we do then?",
  "18805": "You have not been brought up too delicately for that, I hope?",

  "21308": "Well, I suppose it is time we were at table?",
  "21309": "What may that be?",
  "21310": "You consent then?",
  "21311": "It is a man, then, who expects you?",

  "21479": "Oh, where was he?",
  "21480": "If I might make a suggestion, sir?",
  "21481": "What decision?",

  "21488": "How could you shut me out, bear it all alone?",
  "21489": "Would it be an indiscretion to ask to see those precious pills?",
  "21490": "And who is the cause of all this annoyance?",
  "21491": "After this, what more can be wanted?",
  "21492": "Tame?",
  "21493": "Will you take these mementos to him?",
  "21494": "And WHERE has he gone?",
  "21495": "But what is the point of it?",
  "21496": "And what good is it to the bubble while it holds together, or what harm when it is burst?",

  "21989": "You didn't think I was dead?",
  "21990": "Where did they come from?",
  "21991": "Why don't you come over with me today?",

  "22009": "What accounts for its being as light as this?",
  "22010": "On what grounds?",
  "22011": "Who was calling him, and not a soul in sight?",
  "22012": "A boy?",
  "22013": "Does he think we are going to take him in?",
  "22014": "Oh, so that's it?",
  "22015": "And on your honor, you have no cause of hatred against me?",

  "22067": "Did he hear?",
  "22068": "Sugar?",
  "22069": "And has committed no other crime?",
  "22070": "How dare you?",

  "22072": "Where is the count, friend?",
  "22073": "As how?",
  "22074": "Have you any ground of complaint of me?",
  "22075": "Was this the place that he left yesterday?",
  "22076": "What position are bodies placed in?",
  "22077": "And who was he?",
  "22078": "What is freedom to a nation, but freedom to the individuals in it?",
  "22079": "Will you tell me what he said?",
  "22080": "What more shall I say?",
  "22081": "Is there no way to rob them of further triumph, and spurn their mercy and compassion?",
  "22082": "But how will you pay me?",
  "22083": "But did these adventurers complain of space?",
  "22084": "Didn't I tell you the first was from upstairs?",
  "22085": "Should he continue to hold his peace?",
  "22086": "You think he needs cheering up a bit, do you?",
  "22087": "Who, sir?",
  "22088": "Under what circumstances did we meet?",
  "22089": "Would you like to go?",
  "22090": "I say this to prove that he really is, so to speak, more likely to have done this than anyone else, eh?",
  "22091": "Besides, what could he make of it?",
  "22092": "And further on?",
  "22093": "Can I say, confidently, that he was wrong?",
  "22094": "Is that what you want?",
  "22095": "Then how do you account for THAT?",
  "22096": "Who can be that someone?",
  "22097": "Are you going so soon?",
  "22098": "Was it merely a superb, an unparalleled piece of acting?",
  "22099": "What sweepstake?",
  "22100": "Who speaks?",
  "22101": "Sweetheart, can you help me to a pair of slippers?",
  "22102": "Earnshaw?",
  "22103": "May it not be another contrary breeze?",
  "22104": "D'ye follow me?",
  "22105": "But what shall I say of those poor men that are plagued with the pox and the gout?",
  "22106": "Walking at night?",
  "22107": "For me?",
  "22108": "Child, are you out of your senses?",

  "22122": "Why should she suffer?",
  "22123": "Known?",
  "22124": "Not remember that you made me cry?",
  "22125": "Did I ever lose an opportunity of impressing it on your poor papa?",
  "22126": "And how can I do it better?",
  "22127": "But do you think that every man is able to give an account of these very matters about which we are speaking?",
  "22128": "How many are confined in it?",
  "22129": "Was it their fault?",
  "22130": "And what do you think I made it of?",
  "22131": "Are there many dead?",
  "22132": "Is this king of yours a bad man or a good one?",
  "22133": "And what did he mean by my system?",

  "22143": "What is it which that fire shall devour, save thy sins?",
  "22144": "Why don't you go and fetch things, instead of standing there staring at me?",
  "22145": "Yes, but suppose you have to?",
  "22146": "How could I go while you were giving me all this good advice?",
  "22147": "Now don't it?",
  "22148": "Did you observe, captain, how suddenly they sank?",

  "24778": "Which of them will you test?",
  "24779": "Would you really do that?",
  "24780": "How is your old fellow?",
  "24781": "What bottles?",
  "24782": "Could we not keep it as a secret?",
  "24783": "But proportional to what?",
  "24784": "How did you come here?",
  "24785": "What would these insects eat, if we did not pass this way?",
  "24786": "Your advice, then?",
  "24787": "From the monastery?",
  "24788": "Do you think I could ever relish that happiness which was acquired by lessening yours?",
  "24789": "Are you not meditating?",
  "24790": "Who tipped me the black spot the day we landed and began this dance?",
  "24791": "You don't want to kill me, do you?",
  "24792": "Why otherwise, with such an opportunity, hadn't he demanded it?",
  "24793": "Would you compel such a state of affairs?",
  "24794": "Then how do you know?",
  "24795": "Where must I sleep, then?",
  "24796": "Supposing nobody should ever fetch me, how long would they consent to keep me there?",
  "24797": "You will marry me, won't you?",
  "24798": "And I?",
  "24799": "Are you alone, madam?",
  "24800": "Vulgar?",
  "24801": "Is not this change wrought in your minds a very important change?",
  "24802": "True?",
  "24803": "Shall I run on and stop them?",
  "24804": "What sort of road would that be?",
  "24805": "Is it your intention to go to an hotel, sir?",
  "24806": "Agree with what?",
  "24807": "Shall we go this high very long?",
  "24808": "Up?",
  "24809": "Was it this room?",
  "24810": "How then was thy tail created?",
  "24811": "Anyone shot a fox?",
  "24812": "Then what business is it of yours?",
  "24813": "Dishonorable?",
  "24814": "What is the steamer's name?",
  "24815": "Do you often go to see it?",
  "24816": "Damn me, won't you dance?",
  "24817": "How is it that the convicts are lying yonder dead, in the middle of the enclosure?",
  "24818": "But where should she go?",
  "24819": "You would be afraid to draw such an inference, would you not?",
  "24820": "Why, instead of a revolution, did they not content themselves with a reform?",
  "24821": "Why should you say that?",
  "24822": "And had it ready a nice little pinch of salt to put upon his tail?",
  "24823": "In what direction?",
  "24824": "And why was this?",
  "24825": "Now, did it strike your ladyship that she was like anybody?",

  "24830": "What are you waiting for?",
  "24831": "What bell was that?",
  "24832": "And with you, governor?",
  "24833": "Perhaps you don't know it?",
  "24834": "How came the words forth from her?",
  "24835": "Have I not always fought for your glory and interests?",
  "24836": "What, after all, was this blood of which she had taught herself to think so much?",
  "24837": "How do you do?",
  "24838": "But could it be otherwise?",
  "24839": "Must I compel men to render her fitting honor?",
  "24840": "For who gets wealth, that puts not from the shore?",
  "24841": "You feel, in other words, that she lies to you?",
  "24842": "Who has?",
  "24843": "And what crime has he committed?",
  "24844": "And whom are you waiting for?",
  "24845": "Why not say so?",
  "24846": "Nine, ten, eleven?",
  "24847": "And it was a fierce one?",
  "24848": "Why couldn't he go to his own home?",
  "24849": "What is it they 'ad of you, sir?",
  "24850": "What have you been doing all this time, eh?",
  "24851": "Well, what does that lead up to?",
  "24852": "To whom did he call?",
  "24853": "And what are you?",
  "24854": "Could he be dead?",
  "24855": "Will you be willing to leave your present situation and try?",
  "24856": "Why had he stared so at the woman?",
  "24857": "What else can we do?",
  "24858": "Had he fallen during the attack on his rider, or was he straying in the bush, or had the convicts carried him off?",
  "24859": "How can he tell?",
  "24860": "Is it with me or for me that you are angry?",
  "24861": "Then how is it that I seem to understand them myself?",
  "24862": "What am I to DO with this?",
  "24863": "Where dwell we now?",
  "24864": "Are you ordered into camp, too?",
  "24865": "Why are they always anxious?",
  "24866": "What man has authority over himself?",
  "24867": "Who attends to them?",
  "24868": "And now, monseigneur, your answer to this proposition?",
  "24869": "And that caused his sister to refuse my brother?",
  "24870": "Didn't your grandmother ever write you?",
  "24871": "And you think she would be angry?",
  "24872": "What news have you?",
  "24873": "And have you not seen any of our other friends?",
  "24874": "All I'd done?",
  "24875": "If there are other causes of poverty than competition, does that prevent it from contributing its share?",
  "24876": "Why should I deceive you?",
  "24877": "What is it you fear?",
  "24878": "Faithful to whom?",
  "24879": "Ah, but if you got nothing to eat for ever so long?",
  "24880": "A horror?",
  "24881": "Do you think I was sorry?",
  "24882": "What's the matter?",
  "24883": "What about the chair?",
  "24884": "I suppose you will live with her now?",
  "24885": "Of what consequence is it to me, then, whether he be grateful or not?",
  "24886": "And why should the goblins mind you, pray?",
  "24887": "What villainy is this?",
  "24888": "Blewett?",
  "24889": "At home?",
  "24890": "Why, instead of transports that should have intoxicated me with their deliciousness, did I experience only fears and repugnance?",
  "24891": "Whats he?",
  "24892": "Well, he took that icon home with him for a few days and what did he do?",
  "24893": "Why, we must ask, do you trouble yourself so much about death?",
  "24894": "How does your lady, and how thrives your love?",
  "24895": "The greatest affection of which he is capable?",
  "24896": "Wife?",
  "24897": "A pox, is this your inns o' court breeding, not to know your friends and your relations, your elders, and your betters?",
  "24898": "For whence should it be derived?",
  "24899": "Why don't you speak to her?",
  "24900": "And what's her name?",
  "24901": "What are those we know?",
  "24902": "Now do you want me to tell you who you are?",
  "24903": "Are you dissatisfied with my service, say?",
  "24904": "What is the object of slaying the spirit of vegetation at any time and above all in spring, when his services are most wanted?",
  "24905": "What is there in your son's face?",
  "24906": "Gone where?",
  "24907": "What length of course do you propose, dear heart?",
  "24908": "Isn't the house shut up, too?",
  "24909": "Isn't she here?",
  "24910": "In what manner was I protected by him?",
  "24911": "What do you like best?",
  "24912": "Harder on the back, this, than frum the dory, ain't it?",
  "24913": "Is it customary, I ask you, to help to tenderloin with one's fingers?",
  "24914": "Do you imagine that a person can die like this?",
  "24915": "Have you received the orders, and will you act upon them?",
  "24916": "How are they called who follow others in spite of them?",
  "24917": "Do you mean that you saw the murder?",
  "24918": "So I ask you if ye were her friends?",
  "24919": "Was it not then a man like you and me, who first proposed this law, and by speaking persuaded the ancients?",
  "24920": "A political one, I suppose?",
  "24921": "But is there anything impossible for my d'Artagnan, the noble and loyal gentleman?",
  "24922": "What, I ask, in that case, would have been your conduct towards her?",
  "24923": "Do I turn to the right, or to the left hand?",
  "24924": "And suppose he falls?",
  "24925": "An expedition, sir?",
  "24926": "Is it not enough to set him thinking about it?",
  "24927": "What am I?",
  "24928": "An' did ye not marry a nagur?",
  "24929": "Do you believe they're his own?",
  "24930": "But you're not making a mistake?",
  "24931": "Was you a party in anything, ma'am?",
  "24932": "The knight they went to?",
  "24933": "Ask him what?",
  "24934": "Won't that make it all right?",
  "24935": "Have I done something for the general interest?",
  "24936": "Have they legs and chops?",
  "24937": "What do you mean by this conduct?",
  "24938": "You're not a skater, I suppose?",
  "24939": "With him, aunt?",
  "24940": "Why does he not come to me?",
  "24941": "Among all the unfathomable precipices which surrounded him, which was his choice?",
  "24942": "Isn't it an extraordinary thing?",
  "24943": "Mais, monsieur, is it not time to begin to take more counsel of humanity, and less of your courage?",
  "24944": "Don't you see that flock of big birds making for us?",
  "24945": "How shall I requite you?",
  "24946": "Or when he chew'd it?",
  "24947": "How do I know, my dear, what young men do?",
  "24948": "How can I regret when what I did was inevitable?",
  "24949": "And, after all, why shouldn't we believe that?",
  "24950": "Can you have the heart to do it?",
  "24951": "Was not death infinitely more lovely and noble than such a life?",
  "24952": "When shall I set out?",
  "24953": "But what is this on the chest?",
  "24954": "Where's mother?",
  "24955": "Shall we turn?",
  "24956": "And now, do you wish to attend to your letters?",
  "24957": "May it be that, in some fashion or other, you want me?",
  "24958": "Do you know that the least garrison is of twenty companies of infantry?",
  "24959": "Have these confessed?",
  "24960": "Do you suppose I've asked him for an assurance?",
  "24961": "Are you sure it was my house she was coming to?",
  "24962": "And what are those hatfuls of pence and halfpence?",
  "24963": "What does the change mean?",
  "24964": "Monsieur le comte had an enemy there, then?",
  "24965": "Didn't I explain to you?",
  "24966": "Oh, can't you understand?",
  "24967": "Where are you off to?",
  "24968": "Why should this be so?",
  "24969": "His son?",
  "24970": "Well, and what next?",
  "24971": "What, you're on his track?",
  "24972": "Do you expect them today?",
  "24973": "A parson?",
  "24974": "Now, in what sign will the sun then be?",
  "24975": "Is that the way you love your neighbor as yourself?",
  "24976": "If they hear of this, will they let it pass?",
  "24977": "But where are you going,' that you talk about bidding goodbye?",
  "24978": "So you hate each other?",
  "24979": "Do you go home to dinner?",
  "24980": "What had she been doing in all those four long months, he wondered?",
  "24981": "Tell me how and why am I again a prisoner?",
  "24982": "You intend to look after me, then?",
  "24983": "Is not my husband here?",
  "24984": "And is she gone?",
  "24985": "If he had been your own boy, you would have put him to it, just the same, I suppose?",
  "24986": "We asked who they were?",
  "24987": "Is there not one among them who has seen it all, and who knows it to be true?",
  "24988": "Or cold?",
  "24989": "Are you cold?",
  "24990": "What were the joy of man, what else could give him pleasure, but pretty maids and noble dames?",
  "24991": "Can you not be more definite?",
  "24992": "Who is she, or how did you get her?",
  "24993": "Tell me why you came?",
  "24994": "You know that a visa is useless, and that no passport is required?",
  "24995": "Or, shall we continue on our way?",
  "24996": "Do you hear the dog?",
  "24997": "Is his dog dead?",
  "24998": "With our business, how can we get away?",
  "24999": "And what is this?",
  "25000": "What will then become of me?",
  "25001": "You understand, don't you, that if she didn't do this there would be no knowing what she might do?",
  "25002": "Even in the midst of joy, may he not be permitted to be gloomy and oppressed?",
  "25003": "And what does his eminence think of this love, which is, by the bye, no secret to anybody?",
  "25004": "How do they act?",
  "25005": "Which do you like best?",
  "25006": "Have you seen the army?",
  "25007": "But what have I here said, that reflections very refined and metaphysical have little or no influence upon us?",
  "25008": "Fwhat?",
  "25009": "They grow out of our knowledge, ma'am?",
  "25010": "But could you think, because the nodding husband would not wake, that e'er the watchful lover slept?",
  "25011": "And the papers?",
  "25012": "Can you not come to me now, at once, before anything terrible happens?",
  "25013": "My card?",
  "25014": "Why, isn't it there?",
  "25015": "Well, this is strange news, isn't it?",
  "25016": "Tell me, I beseech you, what ails you?",
  "25017": "Of what race could these people be?",
  "25018": "Nevyedovsky?",
  "25019": "Where does your highness wish to go?",
  "25020": "And hasn't it now?",
  "25021": "Will not you, as well as your brother, intercede with your uncle in our behalf?",
  "25022": "Is SHE coming?",
  "25023": "Did you see her face?",
  "25024": "To love me, perhaps?",
  "25025": "In the first place, what proof have we of the fact?",
  "25026": "What are you trying to do?",
  "25027": "No right to be warden of the hospital, papa?",
  "25028": "When are we to discover them?",
  "25029": "Diamonds on the moon?",
  "25030": "What is your errand, then, with me, sir?",
  "25031": "Why is it that the dogs have failed to bark?",
  "25032": "And yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him?",
  "25033": "And do you think your power as great with the fraternity as monsieur le cure told me it was just now?",
  "25034": "And whose room is this, my dear child?",
  "25035": "And me?",
  "25036": "If that is the case, why wait till evening?",
  "25037": "What children?",
  "25038": "Won't you let me run you round in the car?",
  "25039": "Lemme go with you?",

  "25049": "How, got the start?",
  "25050": "Wot dye mean?",
  "25051": "You are going to leave us?",
  "25052": "Wherefore should we linger upon it now?",
  "25053": "But you'll do it?",
  "25054": "Which of my friends, my lord?",
  "25055": "Are you going for a walk?",
  "25056": "What am I going to say?",
  "25057": "What, monsieur, will you leave us so soon?",
  "25058": "You didn't find it then?",
  "25059": "It not the blood in your veins as warm as his?",
  "25060": "Why was it useless to try to win any one's favour?",
  "25061": "But in the face of all of them, whose voice appeals unto me?",
  "25062": "Imprimis, he is older than my father?",
  "25063": "What has been the result of the first war?",
  "25064": "And you have promised?",
  "25065": "Have you the money with you?",
  "25066": "So you were at the races, baron?",

  "25069": "Do?",
  "25070": "Do you not see them doing the same?",
  "25071": "Does the lady go with us, my father?",
  "25072": "Well, when you can combine patriotism and fun, isn't it all right?",
  "25073": "But if it kept her from being seasick it's a mercy I did prowl, isn't it?",
  "25074": "Never seen anchor weighed before?",
  "25075": "Do you burrow, or live in a tree?",
  "25076": "Why did he kill himself instead of you?",
  "25077": "Where had he obtained that blouse?",
  "25078": "Sith then mine evil fortune would have it so, pray tell me, are any of the strangers still alive?",
  "25079": "Where's that?",
  "25080": "I don't suppose you intend to offer me your love?",
  "25081": "Some herb vodka?",
  "25082": "Nay?",
  "25083": "You hailed me, I think?",
  "25084": "Didn't you hear the cannon last night?",
  "25085": "And what do you want here?",
  "25086": "Is it a door with a lock to it?",
  "25087": "Is that honestly said?",

  "25090": "Have you the diamond?",
  "25091": "Or the eastern?",
  "25092": "Is he aiming at doing anything, or simply undoing what's been done?",
  "25093": "Might he be called perfectly virtuous?",
  "25094": "Does the theory of heredity explain it?",
  "25095": "But what else could she do?",
  "25096": "How ken I?",
  "25097": "Is such a hope justified?",
  "25098": "What could I be to a man who had ever gained heartfelt love from a faithful wife?",
  "25099": "Those old patriarchs lived to a jolly good old age, didn't they?",
  "25100": "For your sakes or my own?",

  "25713": "You did not intend to say, eh?",
  "25714": "Do you reckon these two to be akin?",
  "25715": "If I tell mine, will you tell yours?",
  "25716": "Besides, who could tell?",
  "25717": "How has this ended?",
  "25718": "Where then is the constitution either that gives or restrains power?",
  "25719": "In earnest?",
  "25720": "Is that the crook I'm indebted to for the loss of my plans?",
  "25721": "Or should I brile a rasher?",

  "25746": "You are sure, then, that we have found the way to the land of the yellow men?",
  "25747": "Is this mine own countree?",
  "25748": "Was it possible, to breathe in again and again, to breathe out, to feel hunger, to eat again, to sleep again, to sleep with a woman again?",
  "25749": "But may I speak to you for a moment?",
  "25750": "You wish perhaps to boast of the cleverness of your investigation, to cry up your talents as detective?",

  "25756": "What could be going on there?",
  "25757": "Cool?",
  "25758": "Moriarty?",
  "25759": "But cannot you get out by the way in which you entered?",
  "25760": "Where has she gone to dwell?",
  "25761": "What more could a man ask?",
  "25762": "To start with?",
  "25763": "Not going home alone, are you?",

  "25766": "So you have never noticed before how beautiful I am?",
  "25767": "Your majesty will not allow me to justify myself?",
  "25768": "Have I, now?",
  "25769": "At his what?",
  "25770": "You have mistaken my meaning?",
  "25771": "But does it apply to the present case?",
  "25772": "Isn't it dear?",
  "25773": "Where were you born?",
  "25774": "How about those occupations in which time is difficult to calculate?",
  "25775": "Do you propose entering any horses at either of these races, count?",

  "25809": "Can he swim?",
  "25810": "Why can't they?",
  "25811": "What has happened?",
  "25812": "You surely don't mean to stick to your dull fusty old river all your life, and just live in a hole in a bank, and BOAT?",
  "25813": "Why should she thus weep for him in paroxysms of truest grief?",
  "25814": "You know nothing about it?",
  "25815": "Do ye yet feel inclined for it?",
  "25816": "For wherefore should I love them less than heretofore?",
  "25817": "Did the others feel as you did?",
  "25818": "But how often has he been heard to restrain the violent and less reserved expressions of those about him?",
  "25819": "What is he in search of?",

  "25826": "How could I be so cruel to you?",
  "25827": "It is my marriage you mean, is it not, dear grandpapa?",
  "25828": "But tell me, and tell me true, in what way did you die?",
  "25829": "How can one think with one's head all fuzzy?",
  "25830": "How can you expect that I shall continue to love you, when I see you maintain, when I hear you swear to me a thing which I know to be false?",
  "25831": "What can it mean, this relentless persecution?",
  "25832": "Have you forgotten your soul, your spirit, your man's energy, the treasure of your heart?",
  "25833": "WHY so pale and wan, fond lover?",
  "25834": "Two in the morning, or two in the afternoon?",

  "25842": "Should I, too, look back?",
  "25843": "Have you nothing to confess, somebody will ask me, upon this subject?",
  "25844": "Is this enviable or is it not?",
  "25845": "What was the object of the second man?",
  "25846": "Do you think I can stay to become nothing to you?",
  "25847": "Shall I have a barricado made against my friends, to be barr'd of any pleasure they can bring in to me with their honourable visitation?",
  "25848": "What I want to know is, where I ought to rank myself?",
  "25849": "Will you take a gold piece?",
  "25850": "Was it but the mockery of penitence?",
  "25851": "Are they?",

  "25853": "Of course you love him dearly?",
  "25854": "What was the thickness of this wall?",
  "25855": "What pen can describe it?",
  "25856": "Is controlling it as other property the same thing as destroying it, or driving it away?",
  "25857": "What is that, my love?",
  "25858": "Was there no one with you?",
  "25859": "Can you tell us what to do?",
  "25860": "To whom?",
  "25861": "When a good man sticks his bayonet through another good man, father of a family, or, perhaps, a great artist, what idea is he following out?",
  "25862": "Was not I an idiot?",
  "25863": "Ah, it was you, sir?",
  "25864": "Shall we have the light?",
  "25865": "Was it money that we cared for?",
  "25866": "And into what a delicious riot of things am I rushing?",
  "25867": "Why did you not come?",
  "25868": "They are friends of yours, then?",
  "25869": "Did the government keep family histories?",
  "25870": "How did you guess?",
  "25871": "But how can the news be brought to you?",
  "25872": "Could they have fallen into the sea?",
  "25873": "The visible heavens and earth, the whole system of the universe, which may be conceived by the mind, is it created or eternal?",
  "25874": "But where is the other?",
  "25875": "What's the matter with me, anyhow?",
  "25876": "Are you set on the death of that spy?",
  "25877": "Does his mother not know this?",
  "25878": "Then you noticed it too?",
  "25879": "I am right, am I not?",
  "25880": "Why did she take it into her head to die at that moment?",
  "25881": "Saw you ever the like?",
  "25882": "And who am I, to nourish such ambition?",
  "25883": "You are surprised at what you see here?",
  "25884": "Do you hear the laughing and his voice?",
  "25885": "Shall I bear false witness?",
  "25886": "Is he not reviving slowly?",
  "25887": "What's afoot now, young un?",
  "25888": "What sort of a place was it, and what would he be like?",
  "25889": "Had any of them made such a hash of life as he?",
  "25890": "Who's the other cup for?",
  "25891": "Is there more?",
  "25892": "What paper was that?",
  "25893": "And when you know, will you tell me?",
  "25894": "How long would it take for a telegram to reach him?",
  "25895": "Isn't it a dog, sir?",
  "25896": "Do you wish to make good your boasted prowess?",
  "25897": "Is it not, therefore, clear, that in marrying him, you would descend to a rank below you own?",
  "25898": "How should I forget ?",
  "25899": "What boot these wonders?",
  "25900": "And who says so?",
  "25901": "How long have you been engaged?",
  "25902": "What they read in the church?",
  "25903": "You look dumbfoundered?",
  "25904": "If this sailor had escaped the perils of the shipwreck, why should not the captain?",
  "25905": "Oh, how can I live?",
  "25906": "I suppose you can transform us into beasts as well as birds?",
  "25907": "How is it one never sees you?",
  "25908": "Where've you been?",
  "25909": "Now say if I conceal anything from you?",
  "25910": "What speech was there between you?",
  "25911": "Won't your father miss you, and look for you, and let down another rainbow for you?",
  "25912": "Is not all that happiness when they are the three together, husband, wife and child?",
  "25913": "How is it you are so late?",
  "25914": "You have kept a diary of all these so strange things, is it not so?",
  "25915": "But your companions?",
  "25916": "I trust that there is nothing of consequence which I have overlooked?",
  "25917": "Is it for my own sake?",
  "25918": "Well, what are you going to do?",
  "25919": "Don't you see her there away from you?",
  "25920": "And is there nothing on the way?",
  "25921": "Gentlemen, please you change a few crowns for a very excellent blade here?",
  "25922": "What, now, is the significance of this appeal from ANALYSIS to the false judgments of the synthesis?",
  "25923": "Is not that it?",
  "25924": "Forgive you?",
  "25925": "What association?",
  "25926": "But where are these persons, then?",
  "25927": "What doth he seek on the height?",
  "25928": "Where shall we lie in wait?",
  "25929": "And by what gate did they go out?",
  "25930": "From whom can come so many disgraces heaped upon her head, if not from him?",
  "25931": "Who invited you?",
  "25932": "Making love in play, eh?",
  "25933": "How, then, could his father's heart remain void, and closed to its influence?",
  "25934": "Have you heard the story?",
  "25935": "Would you really give us the money?",
  "25936": "But what other internal attributes of such an object can I think than those which my internal sense presents to me?",
  "25937": "Any children?",
  "25938": "How is it distant?",
  "25939": "Which box do you mean?",
  "25940": "How can a system of education flourish that begins by so monstrous a falsehood, which the sense of hearing suffices to contradict?",
  "25941": "Do you know anything about him?",
  "25942": "What are you talking about, then?",
  "25943": "Is it a long drive to the church?",
  "25944": "Diggory?",
  "25945": "Won't that be best?",
  "25946": "How shall I set about it?",
  "25947": "His horses where?",
  "25948": "Have you no father nor mother?",
  "25949": "A present?",
  "25950": "Do you hear me when I tell you that, my darling?",
  "25951": "And when you can do better, you will?",
  "25952": "And does he catch plenty of fish?",
  "25953": "Did you ever stop to think of all the love letters that have been found after death?",
  "25954": "Why do you say that?",
  "25955": "What could she have to conceal from me whose happiness she knew principally consisted in that of herself and her daughter?",
  "25956": "You wouldn't care to go on board for the next trip, and have tea there?",
  "25957": "Do you expect news from him?",
  "25958": "Will you trust me?",
  "25959": "On what authority, then, do you venture to attack universal consent, and give the lie to the human race?",

  "26019": "Do you think they can hear that?",
  "26020": "How do you do, my dear son?",
  "26021": "That is to say, as a thinker who regards morality as questionable, as worthy of interrogation, in short, as a problem?",
  "26022": "Of course you are prepared to identify the property?",
  "26023": "Do you consent to the terms, and will you take the money?",

  "26032": "What are you now?",
  "26033": "What voice is this that has reached my ears?",
  "26034": "And you have fought often?",
  "26035": "Would not the mere circumstance of freight occasion a considerable deduction?",
  "26036": "Does your arm hurt you?",
  "26037": "And your police, they would interfere, would they not?",
  "26038": "Isn't that a kind of abstraction?",

  "26083": "Do you see the likeness?",
  "26084": "How can any one expect that any one else will ever trust a lawyer again after that?",
  "26085": "Who's to put it out?",
  "26086": "Are we no longer on speaking terms?",
  "26087": "And what good thing is there beyond that we may gain by length of days?",
  "26088": "Has she a recognized knight, then?",
  "26089": "From whom does he borrow?",
  "26090": "Which does she mean?",
  "26091": "And does that not go a long way?",

  "26165": "You remember what happened, eh?",
  "26166": "May not a body see her?",
  "26167": "Which are they?",
  "26168": "Then you haven't quarrelled?",
  "26169": "But you absolve me from all other sins, why not from that?",

  "26178": "Nine folks out of ten would own 'twas going too far to dance then, I suppose?",
  "26179": "Madam, do you cut little children's things?",
  "26180": "Why did he let me come here?",
  "26181": "And who are your companions?",
  "26182": "In the presence of witnesses?",
  "26183": "Should she indeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and denounce the murderer?",
  "26184": "Was she not here, put absolutely in his path?",
  "26185": "Shall I do it, and you can see what an idiot he looks?",

  "26194": "And these roses, the fairest that ever were seen?",
  "26195": "Will you have another draught of white hippocras?",
  "26196": "Why should I marry him?",
  "26197": "Wait upon them?",
  "26198": "And why were you so affected at that story, or rather fable, which the count related?",
  "26199": "But suppose they fight?",
  "26200": "The first week, did you say?",
  "26201": "What about women?",
  "26202": "Then shall we fight courageously with them?",
  "26203": "Thereby it asked, in less general terms, what was the cause of the social evil, and what was its remedy?",
  "26204": "Who was it guessed right this time?",
  "26205": "Does the virtue consist in the metaphor, or in the man?",
  "26206": "Think you that a thern would demean himself by labour?",

  "26218": "How could you be so simple?",
  "26219": "Might he not as well come as send?",
  "26220": "What friends?",
  "26221": "Why don't you tell him about them?",
  "26222": "Can no accident, no unforeseen circumstance, snatch it from us?",
  "26223": "Would they keep me long enough to spend seven shillings?",
  "26224": "Do you think it will work?",
  "26225": "What mean you, sirrah?",
  "26226": "Is she fair now as she lies?",
  "26227": "Have you a winged horse, then?",
  "26228": "Where is the bundle we sent down before us?",

  "26230": "He eats, then?",
  "26231": "The hatchway?",
  "26232": "And the one that was not killed?",

  "26242": "Heavens, what is that?",
  "26243": "He is going to return to it immediately, is he not?",
  "26244": "Can you have any doubt of this?",
  "26245": "But you are expecting other guests, aren't you?",

  "26250": "What is most required?",
  "26251": "At the castle?",
  "26252": "Is there no passage inside the door, then?",
  "26253": "Yet again, who shall judge me?",
  "26254": "And shall we revisit together a hapless spot, that proved so fatal to many of our former brave companions?",
  "26255": "Why do you want to know the name of my clerk?",
  "26256": "Why don't you run and jump?",
  "26257": "Is it possible?",
  "26258": "To what, then, are we indebted for our safety?",

  "26260": "Upon your honour?",
  "26261": "Am I wanted for anything?",
  "26262": "What difference can the man make to her?",
  "26263": "You find it a tiresome subject?",
  "26264": "And when you speak of music, do you include literature or not?",

  "26314": "You would like to return to your people?",
  "26315": "Suppose I should tell you wrong?",
  "26316": "What mystery was here?",
  "26317": "Slight, do you say?",
  "26318": "Are we to regard him as a mere lawless egoist, or as something more?",
  "26319": "You'll stay with me, won't you?",
  "26320": "Do you know yourself what you looked like?",

  "26331": "What would you have, my dear fellow?",
  "26332": "What are you running away for?",
  "26333": "Mamma, one need not be ashamed of his being a widower?",
  "26334": "So you have come home, expecting him here?",
  "26335": "And mine?",
  "26336": "Still, if you prefer another name, what shall it be?",
  "26337": "Wherein is a victory more certain by your plan than mine?",
  "26338": "Would you not rather have wine, father?",

  "26351": "What do I seek but his good, for which I've been toiling like a convict ever since he was born?",
  "26352": "Going with him?",
  "26353": "Not seldom that long wandering unfits us for further travel, and of what use is our experience to us then?",
  "26354": "From whence do these pressures come?",
  "26355": "You think it will go to a jury, then?",

  "27545": "Why, what are you thinking about?",
  "27546": "Why should we fear the horrors of famine, when death was swooping down upon us in a multitude of other forms?",
  "27547": "Where's my sword?",
  "27548": "How do you do sir?",
  "27549": "Are there not others for that discipline?",
  "27550": "What is your trouble?",
  "27551": "How do you live then?",
  "27552": "Why should I live now that I have known a perfect love?",
  "27553": "Whose is it?",
  "27554": "And his age?",
  "27555": "To this house?",
  "27556": "Why, pray, do you talk nonsense, as if you had fallen from an ass?",
  "27557": "But why do you take such an interest in me?",
  "27558": "Why has he constantly called them a series of measures?",
  "27559": "What causes?",
  "27560": "Wasn't it all for your good?",
  "27561": "What will be the result of your conduct?",
  "27562": "On account of the great geographical discoveries, the important scientific results?",
  "27563": "Did he want to reduce us by famine?",
  "27564": "Then more husbandmen and more artisans will be required?",
  "27565": "Is not that always so?",
  "27566": "O my brethren, have ye also understood this word?",
  "27567": "Can you take that in?",
  "27568": "Did I understand you?",
  "27569": "Well, is it over?",
  "27570": "And what would he have done had he overtaken us?",
  "27571": "And now, what have you got to say next?",
  "27572": "Do you know that for a fact?",
  "27573": "What need you go, sir, if I tell you?",
  "27574": "What was the use of thinking about behavior after this crying?",
  "27575": "Did it happen here, ever?",
  "27576": "Can the dead come to life?",
  "27577": "But cannot you have pity on me?",
  "27578": "Who will give me seven cents more?",
  "27579": "Is this true?",
  "27580": "In what way different?",
  "27581": "What I mean is, what about the next step?",
  "27582": "Shall your enemy who has injured you go thus unpunished?",
  "27583": "Do you remember it so well?",
  "27584": "Would you ring the bell, please?",
  "27585": "You have achieved it?",
  "27586": "Oh, have you?",
  "27587": "And do not the two styles, or the mixture of the two, comprehend all poetry, and every form of expression in words?",
  "27588": "What are you going to do, my lord?",
  "27589": "Are we to do nothing, then?",
  "27590": "Told you so, didn't I?",
  "27591": "Have done, shipmate, will ye?",
  "27592": "The whole truth?",
  "27593": "What more desirable or more essential than this quality in the governors of nations?",
  "27594": "Don't you see now whence these words have been taken?",
  "27595": "What is your name, dear?",
  "27596": "Governor, why stand you all so pitiless?",
  "27597": "Suppose we say a little something down, and a fuller discussion of the matter later?",
  "27598": "What call you the lord of the castle, sweet face?",
  "27599": "Is the exchange an equitable one?",
  "27600": "What do they care for but money?",
  "27601": "What is it you stare at?",
  "27602": "Surely a man isn't barred for ever from doing you a service just because he happens to love you?",
  "27603": "But you have promised not to go until she comes?",
  "27604": "But what is a cable's length?",
  "27605": "And we'll be in a friendly country?",
  "27606": "What in the world does that mean?",
  "27607": "D'you mean to say they're worth nothing at all?",
  "27608": "What is the use of counting on any success of mine?",
  "27609": "But who were the victors?",
  "27610": "When are you coming out?",
  "27611": "Can you be with us?",
  "27612": "So he is a very good father, is he?",
  "27613": "What do you recognize?",
  "27614": "Where did they draw the treacle from?",
  "27615": "Did not one grain of pity enter your heart as she turned away?",
  "27616": "You're not going with her?",
  "27617": "Is any parallel attempted to be drawn in this company between matrimony and hanging?",
  "27618": "What appointment?",
  "27619": "Who's brought it?",
  "27620": "Who were you then?",
  "27621": "What DID you do, you naughty, bad thing?",
  "27622": "What do you think of those fellows yonder?",
  "27623": "Can't you?",
  "27624": "I suppose you have some cause of quarrel?",
  "27625": "Will she permit it?",
  "27626": "Shall I give you a lift?",
  "27627": "What's that he's got in his paddle?",
  "27628": "But what is this last piece of luck that has befallen you?",
  "27629": "And the wise is good?",
  "27630": "Now what have you to say?",
  "27631": "Who can doubt that the refusal to fight a duel through fear has caused many men an agony of shame?",
  "27632": "Couldn't they see better if they was to wait till daytime?",
  "27633": "Have I gone through all this to fail at the last?",
  "27634": "What, with that face?",
  "27635": "Beyond the mountains, who knew what and whence I was?",
  "27636": "And did he frighten my aunt again?",
  "27637": "What his teachings?",
  "27638": "Do you think I'm putting you into an impossible position?",
  "27639": "Can you hear the sound upon the terrace, through the music, and the beat, and everything?",
  "27640": "Are you a perfect fool?",
  "27641": "Will you let me go with you?",
  "27642": "Ain't you most through with that triple invoiced college of yours?",
  "27643": "How much time have I lost by illness?",
  "27644": "If it ain't no good to swear by, what do you suppose a sperrit would give for it?",
  "27645": "Lend a hand to the girl, can't you?",
  "27646": "Is it enough merely to love if one cannot put all the poetry and all the music of heaven and earth into love?",
  "27647": "The next thing is for us to go and wish 'em joy, I suppose?",
  "27648": "How much have you done?",
  "27649": "Perhaps you are offended, gentlemen, that I should receive such guests in your presence?",
  "27650": "I wonder if the beasts will attack us?",
  "27651": "He was not suffering any, why should he relax his severity?",
  "27652": "Tom, have you said to any one that we made a visit to those people, and that we saw those three together?",
  "27653": "And what had I better do about it, sir?",
  "27654": "Why don't they?",
  "27655": "Polly whom?",
  "27656": "And what we cannot do on a raft could have been done in the ship's boat?",
  "27657": "Does he still continue his rude assaults on those beautiful long silken tresses?",
  "27658": "Did it miss fire?",
  "27659": "What, in heaven's name, was it?",
  "27660": "What were you about saying, sir?",
  "27661": "And who then knoweth why thy body requireth just thy best wisdom?",
  "27662": "But was it possible for him to be brave when he was by himself, face to face with his soul, or would he then surrender to despair?",
  "27663": "Why long for a life which could be for him now only an isolated, desolate, and gloomy one?",
  "27664": "Could we not bail her out?",
  "27665": "How shall we prevent a conflict between charity and judgment?",
  "27666": "What have I all along maintained?",
  "27667": "Disko, what did you pick me up for?",
  "27668": "American, wasn't he?",
  "27669": "Were they at all disposed to give you credit for assisting in the escape?",
  "27670": "How will you take it, ungrateful brute?",
  "27671": "Why, then, suppose now an inertia which definitions contradict, now an external potentiality which nothing proves?",
  "27672": "Whence does she come?",
  "27673": "Well, but what ought to be the criterion?",
  "27674": "You won't be longer than a week at the outside?",
  "27675": "Then, darling papa?",
  "27676": "Or rather was it a boat from the frigate, that was hailing us in the darkness?",
  "27677": "Is this the language of a rational man?",
  "27678": "Well, and how did the ring come into your possession?",
  "27679": "What should I have done as soon as I was hard and fast here?",
  "27680": "Why had not you as good do it?",
  "27681": "Am I going, or not, to my ruin?",
  "27682": "And who is ever silly enough to complain of it?",
  "27683": "But what sort of a way is that for bones to lie?",
  "27684": "What CAN all that green stuff be?",
  "27685": "Do you recognize your quondam pupil, professor?",
  "27686": "I require to be let alone?",
  "27687": "Is it not by chance that the unfortunate child was disinterred under the trees?",
  "27688": "Can he even see the feature?",
  "27689": "Well, why have I worried him, for five years, and never let him go free?",
  "27690": "All that seven hundred dollars?",
  "27691": "But meantime, how am I to get on with my washing?",
  "27692": "Are there then chains for two which are forged on high?",
  "27693": "Then why don't you go?",
  "27694": "How could you have gone away and left me?",
  "27695": "Oh, why had not she, like this woman, resisted, implored?",
  "27696": "Yes, child, but why don't we take him into the parlour, now that we've got a nice parlour for company?",
  "27697": "Is any better than experience and wisdom and reason?",
  "27698": "Is it my fault that your father has dishonored himself?",
  "27699": "But can that which is neither become both?",
  "27700": "But he really is disinterested, and above small jealousy and spite, I have heard?",
  "27701": "And he rests now, near his companions, in the coral cemetery?",
  "27702": "What are we to do, now?",
  "27703": "And now, where is he gone?",
  "27704": "Do you not need to mitigate the struggle for existence more sanguine than the war of weapons?",
  "27705": "When will he come back?",
  "27706": "Suppose you haven't?",
  "27707": "Is it me, yer reverence?",
  "27708": "And why should I not dare?",
  "27709": "And is he in love perchance?",
  "27710": "Surely, this was not the only cause of estrangement?",
  "27711": "Where had he heard the name before?",
  "27712": "Where's my mother?",
  "27713": "Ah, isn't my whole point that he's charming to her?",
  "27714": "Were you looking for us?",
  "27715": "But tell me, and tell me true, what is the meaning of all this feasting, and who are these people?",
  "27716": "Has it begun?",
  "27717": "Where are you taking me?",
  "27718": "What's all this?",
  "27719": "Shall you be present in the reception room?",
  "27720": "What was the matter?",
  "27721": "An astrologer predicted that?",
  "27722": "What magazine, or treasury of bliss?",
  "27723": "What do I think?",
  "27724": "Ah, why DID he?",
  "27725": "How could I ask you to gif up so much for a poor old fellow, who has no fortune but a little learning?",
  "27726": "To whom, think ye, is your life of such consequence, that they should seek to bereave ye of it?",
  "27727": "Is it quite certain?",
  "27728": "Isn't that true, doctor?",
  "27729": "Clayton?",
  "27730": "Why do you not think so?",
  "27731": "And you will permit me to accompany you?",
  "27732": "And when he doesn't say pretty things?",
  "27733": "And you can refuse, you mean, eh?",
  "27734": "Sure, amn't I never done at the drunken bowsy ever since he left school?",
  "27735": "What, then, was there left to do?",
  "27736": "What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed?",
  "27737": "Are you so sure?",
  "27738": "Is that too simple a source of pleasure for some to prize?",
  "27739": "Then you knew her before?",
  "27740": "Have you not asked papa for money?",
  "27741": "Is there anything whimsical about me?",
  "27742": "Wouldn't it be nice if it could last?",
  "27743": "Is this ingratitude, however?",
  "27744": "For nothing?",
  "27745": "What's this fellow in black coming along the lane?",
  "27746": "The winch, you say?",
  "27747": "Was ever a man in such a fearful fool's position?",
  "27748": "But this kind man who has done so much will, I am sure, take you right on to my house?",
  "27749": "But if no one among us is capable of governing himself, then who among us has the capacity to govern someone else?",
  "27750": "Was personal happiness the aim and object of their ambition?",
  "27751": "Have you ever seen a wire jacket?",
  "27752": "Cranmer awaits us in the private chapel?",
  "27753": "And how about today's telegram?",
  "27754": "Where had that daring singer got to?",
  "27755": "Was it he who threw us that bottle, when the vessel made her first cruise?",
  "27756": "You didn't mean to ask that?",
  "27757": "Brilliant?",
  "27758": "Getting a little beyond our depth, dear, aren't we?",
  "27759": "Now, what is competition?",
  "27760": "Why didn't you come near us all these three days, eh?",
  "27761": "Do you know that you are speaking to me quite as a friend?",
  "27762": "What do you do then?",
  "27763": "Do you think we live as cheaply as we might?",
  "27764": "You haven't opened the parcel and swallowed one or two as you come along, have you?",
  "27765": "Surely there are classified lists?",
  "27766": "Who knows whether man is not a recaptured offender against divine justice?",
  "27767": "Why ride into the middle of the battalion?",
  "27768": "May I ask if you can confirm these statements?",
  "27769": "Is not this an infallible and sovereign antidote?",
  "27770": "Well, what's this now?",
  "27771": "Isn't it fortunate I've got such an imagination?",
  "27772": "Now, what have we a right to possess?",
  "27773": "A cigarette?",
  "27774": "But what did he do, my dear?",
  "27775": "What act?",
  "27776": "What in thunder is it?",
  "27777": "And the man?",
  "27778": "How am I to understand you, mon pere?",
  "27779": "Why dilate upon what everybody knows?",
  "27780": "Might this be for you, sir?",
  "27781": "How can you learn lessons in here?",
  "27782": "Who be these?",
  "27783": "Do you love my son?",
  "27784": "Who gets up in the gray dawn to call on another man's wife?",
  "27785": "What follows that angel?",
  "27786": "Will it strengthen our families and support our children?",
  "27787": "Why where should I leave them but where I found them?",
  "27788": "Shall he now be arrested in his desolating career?",
  "27789": "Do you know what that means?",
  "27790": "But why should I make a long story of it?",
  "27791": "Mightn't I stay and sleep with you tonight, grandmother?",
  "27792": "Are you not jealous at all?",
  "27793": "And is not the chief object of vanity, our bravery or learning, our wit or breeding, our eloquence or address, our taste or abilities?",
  "27794": "Jo, I hope you haven't done anything rash?",
  "27795": "And do you believe it to be so?",
  "27796": "Do you take milk in yours?",
  "27797": "What fiend is this?",
  "27798": "Where are they?",
  "27799": "Would any one believe it?",
  "27800": "What if I've accepted too passively the funny form of our life?",
  "27801": "What, indeed, can tend to deprave the character more than outward submission and inward contempt?",
  "27802": "If they bite and kick?",
  "27803": "Is there that about me that should affright a man?",
  "27804": "For how can any experience be adequate with an idea?",
  "27805": "What is this I hear about you?",
  "27806": "How old are you, dear?",
  "27807": "I wonder if they made that fearful sound I heard just before you came?",
  "27808": "What made them kick you out?",
  "27809": "Am I allowed to repeat it?",
  "27810": "I think that this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with me for six o'clock?",
  "27811": "Have you any dice in your pocket?",
  "27812": "What on earth put such a notion into your head?",
  "27813": "None belonging to your father?",
  "27814": "What had he to say?",
  "27815": "Owing to him?",
  "27816": "To me, sir?",
  "27817": "What do you suppose she wants to talk about tomorrow?",
  "27818": "Would he say a lie?",
  "27819": "How much money had these men fraudulently obtained?",
  "27820": "How many have you loved?",
  "27821": "Then why, when you were able to run away, did you go back to him?",
  "27822": "And don't you think the governor ought to let me have it?",
  "27823": "You are alone?",
  "27824": "What are your favourite flowers?",
  "27825": "Why didn't I go in then?",
  "27826": "By your misfortune?",
  "27827": "Now are you satisfied?",
  "27828": "Who is your lady friend with the big grey envelope and the fat monogram outside?",
  "27829": "Have you got them?",
  "27830": "Did you get lost?",
  "27831": "I wonder how he felt when he heard it?",
  "27832": "What need for weapon?",
  "27833": "'Ow many times have I got to tell you to be careful of them plates?",
  "27834": "Weevle?",
  "27835": "What you're after, why you left the block house, why you given me that there chart, I don't know, now, do I?",
  "27836": "Are we falling?",
  "27837": "And by character?",
  "27838": "And would not a really good education furnish the best safeguard?",
  "27839": "What manner of man are you?",
  "27840": "I think you are growing less cool, my friend, and are beginning to be a trifle surprised, aren't you?",
  "27841": "And that one?",
  "27842": "Has he ever taken from the rich that he did not give again to the poor?",
  "27843": "Has your mother relented at last?",
  "27844": "What do you want to do?",
  "27845": "Is this all your spinning, grandmother?",
  "27846": "What sort of ship?",
  "27847": "And do they not share?",
  "27848": "Why isn't it enough?",
  "27849": "Shall I meet strange, heavenly things?",
  "27850": "Didn't I see him seize your hand?",
  "27851": "What is that thing?",
  "27852": "But who else?",
  "27853": "Why, how?",
  "27854": "Do you hear, my children?",
  "27855": "Can you deny that all that was craft and deceit and fraud and greed?",
  "27856": "You mean that she will be killed merely to thwart me?",
  "27857": "How shall we set about it?",
  "27858": "Not too difficult?",
  "27859": "Were his father's religious devotion, his teachers warnings, his own knowledge, his own search able to keep him safe?",
  "27860": "Should they be embarked?",
  "27861": "Is my experience but of yesterday?",
  "27862": "Can I trust in you?",
  "27863": "Are you in earnest?",
  "27864": "Where are you to go?",
  "27865": "Do you want to earn half a crown?",
  "27866": "Wilcox?",
  "27867": "What do I mean?",
  "27868": "But will no one remain in the house, my lord?",
  "27869": "How, then, with these variations and with revenues so uncertain, can we establish even distribution and uniform wages for laborers?",
  "27870": "Of the hearses?",
  "27871": "But will you not drink with me, sir?",
  "27872": "What avail is it?",
  "27873": "Don't you see them?",
  "27874": "Oh, I must, hey?",
  "27875": "Or are they both in this their own reward?",
  "27876": "Said ye not truly, aforetime, that we should live and meet?",
  "27877": "What do we do?",
  "27878": "How will you live?",
  "27879": "Why don't you fall yourself?",
  "27880": "Will you remember that, if you please?",
  "27881": "Does he read ee very long zermons, my dear?",
  "27882": "What is a passport?",
  "27883": "How long do you remain in town?",
  "27884": "Don't you, old man?",
  "27885": "Where shall I see the head of him which contrived to murder his father, which I will tear to pieces with my own hands?",
  "27886": "Why this absence of mind, and sweet irresolution?",
  "27887": "We better than you?",
  "27888": "Did this mad wife of his carry it off with her?",
  "27889": "Had the man seen through him?",
  "27890": "But will you promise to have me took there, sir, and laid along with him?",
  "27891": "But if I do not marry?",
  "27892": "Why did he interfere with me, and fill your mind with such falsehood?",
  "27893": "But when one has no experience, how can one tell what is sickness and what is health?",
  "27894": "How can you tell who is poor?",
  "27895": "Is it so precious?",
  "27896": "Why am I to be disturbed?",
  "27897": "Will you take my advice?",
  "27898": "Something important?",
  "27899": "Perhaps you think I am mad, eh?",
  "27900": "Shall you have the courage?",
  "27901": "Will you forget him?",
  "27902": "Wait for you?",
  "27903": "Now, what fault can you point out in him?",
  "27904": "CUI BONO?",
  "27905": "Where had the dragon gone in such a short space of time?",
  "27906": "You've got a friend here?",
  "27907": "What has he made you?",
  "27908": "You keep the registers of entries and departures?",
  "27909": "To what tribe do they belong?",
  "27910": "I don't suppose that you have noticed it?",
  "27911": "Couldn't you ask him here dinner or something?",
  "27912": "And then?",
  "27913": "What does your wife want?",
  "27914": "Couldn't you wish to be married to him yourself, if that was the case?",
  "27915": "You notice those bright green spots scattered thickly over it?",
  "27916": "It was his life or mine, but far more than that, it was his life or hers, for how could I leave her in the power of this madman?",
  "27917": "Then there is a truth I don't know?",
  "27918": "How did I get hold of that?",
  "27919": "What would the wenches do?",
  "27920": "Whatever is the matter?",
  "27921": "And it is true that you did not set it on fire?",
  "27922": "Has anything unpleasant happened since I saw you?",
  "27923": "Is it believed that axioms in metaphysics, declarations of right, harangues from the tribune, will put a stop to the disbanding of an army?",
  "27924": "What does not a man undergo for the sake of a cure?",
  "27925": "Shan't you?",
  "27926": "You a member here?",
  "27927": "What is your own experience of him?",
  "27928": "But aren't you mistaken in thinking that you wouldn't force him, wouldn't punish him?",
  "27929": "Me, young ladies?",
  "27930": "What are these corruptions?",
  "27931": "Doesn't he?",
  "27932": "Why must he look farther than their platform when he claims himself to stand by his platform?",
  "27933": "Now, surely, if he takes so warmly to people who are not related to him at all, may he not take as warmly to his own kin?",
  "27934": "Not since the humour of gentility was upon you, did you?",
  "27935": "Governor come round?",
  "27936": "That boy's tutor?",
  "27937": "What is a soul?",
  "27938": "And with our wives?",
  "27939": "Who would think of plotting with a poor little weak creature like me?",
  "27940": "What is his exact kin to us, mother?",
  "27941": "Is this a new brand of humour?",
  "27942": "Yes, what were we talking about?",
  "27943": "Do I know them?",
  "27944": "And what business have you here?",
  "27945": "You know who bricks and mortar is, I suppose, sir?",
  "27946": "Oh, what's the use of me saying anything?",
  "27947": "I make the first advances?",
  "27948": "Why strive for the knowledge of things if we become more cowardly thereby?",
  "27949": "Why, how do you come to be here?",
  "27950": "What the devil is he doing here?",
  "27951": "What's he to do with the lassie?",
  "27952": "Why must people kneel down to pray?",
  "27953": "Do you like him?",
  "27954": "First tell the boys, what we have decided?",
  "27955": "What is it to be?",
  "27956": "Tell us, dear, what do the creatures look like?",
  "27957": "Do you see that whale now?",
  "27958": "How is it that there are birds enough ready to replace immediately a lost mate of either sex?",
  "27959": "You admit, I hope, that I have a right to speak about what concerns the dignity of my wife's sister?",
  "27960": "Will somebody hand me anything hard and bruising to pelt at her?",
  "27961": "Is he industrious at his work and respectful to you?",
  "27962": "That's the way the song runs, isn't it?",
  "27963": "Could her face inspire passion at all now?",
  "27964": "Why ought I to know?",
  "27965": "And you are not furious?",
  "27966": "Ellen, are not you tired?",
  "27967": "Will you let me go away?",
  "27968": "John, why don't you say something?",
  "27969": "But what shall I tell the dairyman's wife?",
  "27970": "And you don't know what they do it for?",
  "27971": "Or at some public school, perhaps?",
  "27972": "They do, do they?",
  "27973": "Is not the night mournful, sad, and melancholic?",
  "27974": "I asked them, if they were at liberty to tell me the truth of what they were to do with me?",
  "27975": "Why are you sorry, sir?",
  "27976": "What prison is he in?",
  "27977": "Shall we go on, your excellency, fine champagne?",
  "27978": "Leave our brother to come to us?",
  "27979": "Will you really not have tea?",
  "27980": "Whom do you expect to find here?",
  "27981": "Have you no other to propose?",
  "27982": "What can a writer, who professes scepticism, have in common with radical views?",
  "27983": "See that blue dory behind him?",
  "27984": "But is an education which ignores them all a liberal education?",
  "27985": "What upon?",
  "27986": "But who has told you?",
  "27987": "Where are my priwileges?",
  "27988": "Well, did she say what she was coming for?",
  "27989": "How can I ever thank you?",
  "27990": "And cannot the ruffian, the brutal, the debased, by slave law, own just as many slaves as the best and purest?",
  "27991": "You own the name and renounce the alias?",
  "27992": "Is he of noble family, and rich?",
  "27993": "How then are we to begin our strike to destroy him?",
  "27994": "Who is this boy?",
  "27995": "And who hit you at all?",
  "27996": "What are these men's leading principles, and about what kind of things are they busy, and for what kind of reasons do they love and honor?",
  "27997": "Thornfield?",
  "27998": "May I ask if you are very busy just now?",
  "27999": "How can it concern him to learn how the self came to be what it is, or what it will be in the distant future?",
  "28000": "You think it will?",
  "28001": "But why should I weary you with details?",
  "28002": "So you kept him after all?",
  "28003": "And the queen?",
  "28004": "That we see before our noses?",
  "28005": "Can I never tell my story in a plain, straightforward way?",
  "28006": "Can competition in labor be abolished?",
  "28007": "You cannot help us?",
  "28008": "But what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance?",
  "28009": "What was the use of his being somewhere in the neighbourhood if she had no means of knowing where she could find him?",
  "28010": "You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?",
  "28011": "You will protect me from him?",
  "28012": "Had you heard?",
  "28013": "Can you remember that?",
  "28014": "Ever live by cheating at play?",
  "28015": "Why do you permit such a surgeon to have the care of the sick, wounded, and dying soldiers?",
  "28016": "And is that why he hits her?",
  "28017": "Why, what is there to understand?",
  "28018": "Yet you have a large establishment, too, I am told?",
  "28019": "And you think that I am going to send you back to that world which must know me no more?",
  "28020": "What is done to infanticides in this country?",
  "28021": "And did you see anyone?",
  "28022": "Well, then, what makes you talk so wild?",
  "28023": "You have formed one, then?",
  "28024": "Will you please pardon my rudeness?",
  "28025": "My dear father, may I beg you to prepare your mind for what I am going to say?",
  "28026": "With what my father said just now?",
  "28027": "What did you think of that, sir?",
  "28028": "Would you like me to sit down for a minute or two?",
  "28029": "He is going with you, is he not?",
  "28030": "Of what disposition is he?",
  "28031": "What is it, then?",
  "28032": "Where did you really get them?",
  "28033": "Mark must be here, yet why doesn't he answer me?",
  "28034": "What did you expect to gain by that?",
  "28035": "What heart can hold?",
  "28036": "When horses are injured, are they improved or deteriorated?",
  "28037": "Had he left her there to her fate in the lonely jungle?",
  "28038": "How do you do, all of you?",
  "28039": "Do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not talk as fast, and admire what she admires as rapturously as herself?",
  "28040": "Curious?",
  "28041": "Do you intend to sit up for me?",
  "28042": "But would the man acknowledge the relation?",
  "28043": "What are you doing now?",
  "28044": "Do you suppose that if I had made such a revelation to the king, I should have been alive now?",
  "28045": "He had a passion for pictures, and why should he not be able to paint as well as anybody else?",
  "28046": "Are you the gentleman who caused the accident?",
  "28047": "And the pay?",
  "28048": "Husband?",
  "28049": "I know what everyone would say is the right thing to do, but what do you say?",
  "28050": "What difference can it make to you?",
  "28051": "How could he know what comes from a woman's wavering sympathies, what from her inborn coquetry, and what from love itself?",
  "28052": "Was he a proprietor, or only a usufructuary?",
  "28053": "Wasn't that nonsensical?",
  "28054": "You have sold all your clothes?",
  "28055": "Surely you learnt that too?",
  "28056": "WHAT is it?",
  "28057": "But at this moment who knows if we may not be frightfully crushed between the two glassy surfaces?",
  "28058": "We must take care that that affair comes off all right, must we not?",
  "28059": "Why do you shake me like that?",
  "28060": "Now really should a cock be brought into a tragic play?",
  "28061": "Is his thread spun?",
  "28062": "Have not you an intimate friend?",
  "28063": "But how, and wherewith?",
  "28064": "That was a very different account of matters, was it not?",
  "28065": "What laws mean you?",
  "28066": "And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps?",
  "28067": "And on what will you sleep?",
  "28068": "That is what comes of your gospel of love, is it?",
  "28069": "Beautiful?",
  "28070": "Didn't say nothin' 'bout my old man, s'pose?",
  "28071": "Is it really possible that perfectly innocent people are kept here?",
  "28072": "You know the road?",
  "28073": "So if I say they're gone, you'll bear me witness, will you?",
  "28074": "Why should you not mention the sum?",
  "28075": "They're quite neat and decent, aren't they?",
  "28076": "To what a devil, then, said he, serve so many paltry heaps and bundles of papers and copies which you give me?",
  "28077": "How did you get such small small legs?",
  "28078": "But why shouldn't they petition, doctor?",
  "28079": "What is that news?",
  "28080": "His nieces accompany him, no doubt?",
  "28081": "Well, but whom are you attacking?",
  "28082": "Am I fool?",
  "28083": "What should hinder it?",
  "28084": "Is this true, my pulse?",
  "28085": "Have you given in your resignation, mademoiselle?",
  "28086": "How can you make yourself so inferior to me, as to show such a bad spirit?",
  "28087": "How can that be managed?",
  "28088": "When shall we be able to fish again?",
  "28089": "And what may your purpose be, most lofty lady?",
  "28090": "And when the better part of their products are consumed by others at the play, do you assure me that their families are not in want?",
  "28091": "Do I combine?",
  "28092": "What good was there in doing that?",
  "28093": "How can you do it seriously?",
  "28094": "Read?",
  "28095": "Was I absurd?",
  "28096": "Live like this?",
  "28097": "And if I could, what comfort to me?",
  "28098": "Aglaya, may I kiss YOUR prince?",
  "28099": "You mean to ask, I said, what will be our answer?",
  "28100": "You do not mean to inherit that infamous crotchet my brother has got into his head?",
  "28101": "Not a circus?",
  "28102": "Well, what have you got in your ear?",
  "28103": "What came of it?",
  "28104": "What makes it smell so funny?",
  "28105": "Which way are you going?",
  "28106": "Sure, little woman?",
  "28107": "The boy's, then?",
  "28108": "How d'you account for the general indifference, then?",
  "28109": "Why do you delay?",
  "28110": "Proud, eh?",
  "28111": "Since no man has aught of what he leaves, what is't to leave betimes?",
  "28112": "How is he?",
  "28113": "Were there not the brilliant particles of a halo in the air about his head?",
  "28114": "I therefore turned towards him with a stern countenance, and asked, who he called fool?",
  "28115": "What should ye have in common with cats and wolves?",
  "28116": "You want me to swear?",
  "28117": "What you standing there for?",
  "28118": "Perhaps he is just as fond of suffering?",
  "28119": "What's the matter with you, old man?",
  "28120": "Married woman, I believe?",
  "28121": "Will you grant it to me?",
  "28122": "And the chin, with its dimples, as in health, might it not be hers?",
  "28123": "What will happen then?",
  "28124": "You mean that the thing is supernatural?",
  "28125": "And if I do speak to her, my lord, what then?",
  "28126": "Was it sufficient?",
  "28127": "Have you ever committed a sin?",
  "28128": "Presented to whom?",
  "28129": "Not for myself?",
  "28130": "Well, sir, will you go?",
  "28131": "Where did you go?",
  "28132": "What have we done?",
  "28133": "Do you jog hither, wagging your tails, to pant at my wine, and bepiss my barrel?",
  "28134": "What was going on in congress?",
  "28135": "Do you need a doctor?",
  "28136": "Why, oh why, have I betrayed myself?",
  "28137": "Had he any intellect, any thinking faculty, any consciousness of his own existence?",
  "28138": "Outspoken, is she?",
  "28139": "Is it honouring your husband to dishonour his business?",
  "28140": "To whom resort for relief?",
  "28141": "What must be done then?",
  "28142": "Are yours like that?",
  "28143": "And now, are you aware of one thing, monsieur?",
  "28144": "Is he on this farm?",
  "28145": "Now, did you not think so?",
  "28146": "What do men know about women's martyrdoms?",
  "28147": "What can be done?",
  "28148": "What are you going to do if you don't get work?",
  "28149": "Is the room to be got ready upstairs?",
  "28150": "Will you be silent?",
  "28151": "But how could she?",
  "28152": "Don't you all despise me for not stealing, when it would have been only justice?",
  "28153": "How shall I bring forth my wife?",
  "28154": "And the greater the interval which separates them from philosophy and reason, the more strange and illusive will be the pleasure?",
  "28155": "Does he also desire his archic man to be got up in a manner befitting royalty at a certain date?",
  "28156": "What can I do for you, my child?",
  "28157": "Well, the question is, what do you know about her?",
  "28158": "What was the chief trade in this place?",
  "28159": "Suppose that she coulde pittie me, what then?",
  "28160": "Where is the child?",
  "28161": "What will you take?",
  "28162": "But who could have foreseen such an attention as this?",
  "28163": "Do you know I have entrusted him with our secret?",
  "28164": "Your sister is dead, then?",
  "28165": "What have I done to displease you?",
  "28166": "How begot, how nourished?",
  "28167": "What was the good of playing?",
  "28168": "Would she not be marvellously fair to look upon when in happy mood, seeing that she is so fair in her displeasure?",
  "28169": "Any youngsters?",
  "28170": "Can a man who possesses the slightest common sense be so unreasonable?",
  "28171": "Have you kept him in the cellar all this time?",
  "28172": "Did either of you boys touch it?",
  "28173": "Why has HE done nothing?",
  "28174": "Arrest you, my most faithful servant?",
  "28175": "Might be a pun on my pottering about here, mightn't it?",
  "28176": "Why did she betray the two of them so terribly, in embracing the glow of the evening?",
  "28177": "Are you a missionary?",
  "28178": "And in what condition?",
  "28179": "What haven't you, love, said in your time?",
  "28180": "Did they have any repinings because of their course?",
  "28181": "You understand what I mean?",
  "28182": "And why shouldn't I?",
  "28183": "You serve the cardinal?",
  "28184": "Where is his pistol?",
  "28185": "What DOES it call itself, I wonder?",
  "28186": "Was she not very much surprised?",
  "28187": "But what is that blockhead of a benevolent gentleman doing?",
  "28188": "And how do you know my heart is innocent?",
  "28189": "Shall I leave you?",
  "28190": "So what does it matter?",
  "28191": "But how have you procured them from your mother?",
  "28192": "Or whether we should hold that cowardice makes no difference in the end, seeing that we all must share alike?",
  "28193": "Now, do you find the business good, and the investment advantageous?",
  "28194": "And I dare say you sing a little, too?",
  "28195": "Was she normal?",
  "28196": "Are their heads off?",
  "28197": "This page or this page?",
  "28198": "What kind of a man is he?",
  "28199": "For who, let me ask, ever heard of a balloon manufactured entirely of dirty newspapers?",
  "28200": "Will you tell me how that came about?",
  "28201": "For how can we know all the possible cases that may arise?",
  "28202": "But now I have told you, you don't think it wrong of me, do you?",
  "28203": "And why should she expect her brother to do that which her brother's guests would decline to do?",
  "28204": "Do you know that if I were not consumptive, I would kill myself?",
  "28205": "What was there in the young girl's glance on this occasion?",
  "28206": "And then, why did he not at least answer it?",
  "28207": "But where are they, then?",
  "28208": "And then he can write back to my address, and I can smuggle the letter to you?",
  "28209": "Won what, ma'am?",
  "28210": "What dreadful thing drives her to say this, father, when it is such a pain to her?",
  "28211": "How long would the race endure if the parental instinct were wholly lacking?",
  "28212": "Don't you dance?",
  "28213": "What then, my gentle sister?",
  "28214": "Which of the two will be the first to fall?",
  "28215": "Was this the right corner to turn?",
  "28216": "What are we?",
  "28217": "Who of you have done more?",
  "28218": "Get it?",
  "28219": "Whose hand's out?",
  "28220": "Alas, do you love nothing else in me?",
  "28221": "Shall we send the watch there?",
  "28222": "Would you mind my taking 'em out and looking at 'em for a minute, to see how they are made?",
  "28223": "Would you believe it?",
  "28224": "But you were married?",
  "28225": "Jespersen?",
  "28226": "Is papa alive?",
  "28227": "How is she?",
  "28228": "What do the overhanging warehouses make of that?",
  "28229": "Mathematics?",
  "28230": "But is it so?",
  "28231": "And with whom?",
  "28232": "Don't you see, you brute, that my dog is a lurcher?",
  "28233": "What has it turned to, then?",
  "28234": "What would she say if she knew the truth?",
  "28235": "Don't you see you are the very one to bring yourself and family here?",
  "28236": "You loved your mother, then?",
  "28237": "I wonder what we both did that for?",
  "28238": "Damn you, sir, will you let me look inside that cab?",
  "28239": "Is there no voice in your mother's heart that forbids you to destroy your son's ideals?",
  "28240": "Been havin' a snooze, ole boy?",
  "28241": "Have you the tact?",
  "28242": "I could even go with you now?",
  "28243": "What shall you wear?",
  "28244": "How large is the garland?",
  "28245": "You are wrong, and what can you do better with your leisure hours?",
  "28246": "What did you do next?",
  "28247": "Well, where are you taking me, then?",
  "28248": "What was it he talked about?",
  "28249": "Will it hold water?",
  "28250": "Is this the missis?",
  "28251": "How shall the lots be drawn?",
  "28252": "Cannot make you understand WHAT?",
  "28253": "What'll they think of us?",
  "28254": "Who would have believed it?",
  "28255": "What means this woman?",
  "28256": "And turn all the people of the villages against us?",
  "28257": "What's the matter with the old man attending to him personally?",
  "28258": "Would you like supper?",
  "28259": "What do you say, monsieur?",
  "28260": "Do you want to know what it is in him?",
  "28261": "And why would you either?",
  "28262": "Will you wait here?",
  "28263": "Doctor seen them?",
  "28264": "So there's nothing?",
  "28265": "And shall we eat bread?",
  "28266": "Ankle all right, eh?",
  "28267": "But who was she?",
  "28268": "Why should there often be so great a difference in the result of a reciprocal cross between the same two species?",
  "28269": "Is there any better or equal hope in the world?",
  "28270": "But I wanted to ask you directly what you think of me, of my life?",
  "28271": "Of course, if one doesn't go to a public school those sort of schools are the next best thing, aren't they?",
  "28272": "Are you quite impervious to good advice?",
  "28273": "Captain's a great feller, ain't he?",
  "28274": "What is the matter with me?",
  "28275": "Did you see herself?",
  "28276": "Are we lovers?",
  "28277": "And how could you think o' going to the pond, and taking your sister where there was dirt?",
  "28278": "Against D'Artagnan?",
  "28279": "What lineage, what lineage?",
  "28280": "Did you post that letter yourself?",
  "28281": "But is it a kind heart?",
  "28282": "Shall we descend to the party at all?",
  "28283": "You are not playing with us?",
  "28284": "But why did it not kill my father?",
  "28285": "What other view could he have?",
  "28286": "And because you fear that it may be?",
  "28287": "Such a thing as a what?",
  "28288": "Are you trying to find out something bad about me?",
  "28289": "You lost your school and good income through her, did you not?",
  "28290": "Shall I take her to a coach?",
  "28291": "Was it his profile that was seen on the blind two nights before?",
  "28292": "When you became engaged to the young lady whom you have just mentioned, did you make a regular proposal to her family?",
  "28293": "Can tha' read?",
  "28294": "Do all astronomers admit the existence of this satellite?",
  "28295": "What were we created for?",
  "28296": "Is there any drinkable wine in your tavern?",
  "28297": "To my lady's?",
  "28298": "Society?",
  "28299": "Was he the only passenger who came on board at that untimely hour?",
  "28300": "Did you take part in the campaign?",
  "28301": "Aren't you going to take a practice then?",
  "28302": "Alone?",
  "28303": "Did you groan?",
  "28304": "Is he not a handsome man?",
  "28305": "Why pique all mortals, yet affect a name?",
  "28306": "Can you come directly?",
  "28307": "Have you never heard these respectable men, when they got home again, talking about the way in which immorality runs rampant abroad?",
  "28308": "Did I think she was alive?",
  "28309": "Won't that make a queer combination?",
  "28310": "Haven't you got it on now?",
  "28311": "About the way in which we've treated that angel of a girl?",
  "28312": "By nothing?",
  "28313": "You watch while I sleep and you have come to bring me some news?",
  "28314": "Then why did ye not seek him there?",
  "28315": "And what object or consideration more pleasing than this can be presented to the human mind?",
  "28316": "Where did you go to school?",
  "28317": "Did you see the exquisite old lace she sent me?",
  "28318": "Which was first, thirst or drinking?",
  "28319": "What had become of him?",
  "28320": "Expectations?",
  "28321": "You are?",

  "28717": "And his little girl, what am I to do with her?",
  "28718": "Have you observed how intense sound is down here?",
  "28719": "Tell yer what?",
  "28720": "How, then, did you know of it?",
  "28721": "Then why are you crying?",
  "28722": "You haven't seen any of them?",
  "28723": "What is there in her?",
  "28724": "The first time I met an example of this handwriting, I was positively astonished, and where do you think I chanced to find it?",
  "28725": "What signal?",
  "28726": "What are you thinking of?",
  "28727": "Is there one from the duchess?",
  "28728": "It was you, then, in short, who caused the two condemned persons to be hung?",
  "28729": "He has spoken?",
  "28730": "Won't you give papa and I a little of your company, lovee?",
  "28731": "Shan't I do as I like at the last?",
  "28732": "Oh really?",
  "28733": "Is he afraid of me or of his father?",
  "28734": "Why do you remain with her?",
  "28735": "'Tisn't so bad as that with me?",
  "28736": "But how did you know me?",
  "28737": "You know painters, then?",
  "28738": "Not for use?",
  "28739": "Is the prisoner at fifteen francs there?",
  "28740": "Then you no longer refuse?",
  "28741": "And who will dare to say that?",
  "28742": "Why did you not shun the occasions of sin?",
  "28743": "What have they done to you?",
  "28744": "Pray now, good father hermit, have not you here some other pastime besides fasting?",
  "28745": "In time to have it cooked for the next course?",
  "28746": "Is it some one belonging to the theater police?",
  "28747": "Do you have a spell?",
  "28748": "How is your grandfather?",
  "28749": "Do you see this man?",
  "28750": "Césarine's young man?",
  "28751": "And who brought you up?",
  "28752": "For such an outrage was not death your due?",
  "28753": "Willoughby, what is the meaning of this?",
  "28754": "How was it possible for man to do good before these sages' appearance on earth?",
  "28755": "But how did she poison herself?",
  "28756": "Hullo, what is this?",
  "28757": "And what were you thinking about?",
  "28758": "Don't you know with what object I have come here, and if you do know, can you throw no light upon it?",
  "28759": "May I have the other few minutes another time?",
  "28760": "How do you like it?",
  "28761": "Still, with civil war just commencing, who could tell?",
  "28762": "And don't they like it now?",
  "28763": "And are not those petty, tormenting cares less hurtful than a continual brooding over the great affliction that oppresses us?",
  "28764": "And you will be satisfied with no other wages than your food?",
  "28765": "Why, whatever makes you think that?",
  "28766": "Justify it?",
  "28767": "And you do joy to see me thwacked about on the ribs?",
  "28768": "Isn't there any such island?",
  "28769": "But who was that possessor?",
  "28770": "Why then should you keep on being so angry with him?",
  "28771": "O heauens, why made you night, to couer sinne?",
  "28772": "Haven't I just told you I let my regiment down?",
  "28773": "Don't you hear how cursedly it blows?",
  "28774": "Is it so bad?",
  "28775": "Is it not to feed the hungry, to aid in their deliverance by the means which faith suggests?",
  "28776": "Might they not have been lost by some of these people in one of their landings?",
  "28777": "Who's that mug?",
  "28778": "Are you doing anything tonight?",
  "28779": "What were your parents?",
  "28780": "But what words did he say?",
  "28781": "Not at all?",
  "28782": "In how long?",
  "28783": "Shall we call this the promised land?",
  "28784": "Are you very old yourself?",
  "28785": "What did you commit by so acting?",
  "28786": "Acquitted the culprits and condemned the innocent, have you?",
  "28787": "Why didn't you tell me that at first?",
  "28788": "How then should the news alluded to have escaped me?",
  "28789": "Well, captain?",
  "28790": "Why should he be pacing his room all the time?",
  "28791": "Oh well, lend me five bob, will you?",
  "28792": "Sucking his drink?",
  "28793": "But have you no relatives?",
  "28794": "Does the comparison require much time or labor?",
  "28795": "How much did it cost you?",
  "28796": "Who are you going to tackle first?",
  "28797": "Have a drink with you?",
  "28798": "What more?",
  "28799": "Then why have you come back at ALL?",
  "28800": "Has that dog stopped shivering yet?",
  "28801": "D'ye feel brave men, brave?",
  "28802": "Can't you take leave?",
  "28803": "Under what circumstances did you see him?",
  "28804": "Did master sleep well?",
  "28805": "Did they come ashore here?",
  "28806": "And from what?",
  "28807": "But do you know who that lady is you talk about in such a fashion?",
  "28808": "But what is the matter, my boy?",
  "28809": "And you fancy he will not put his maxim into execution, now that he has got hold of the king?",
  "28810": "A dog has got under my bed?",
  "28811": "And where is the governor?",
  "28812": "His sister worked also but what could she do with seven little children?",
  "28813": "And I considered whether, if it should signify any one of these meanings, which was so very likely, could I quite answer for myself?",
  "28814": "That can't be wrong, can it?",
  "28815": "Save me from death?",
  "28816": "My brother?",
  "28817": "Or, did he stop after the last hecatomb?",
  "28818": "Don't you think I deserve another kiss, then?",
  "28819": "Was she, or is she, mad, or what sort of horrible danger is it?",
  "28820": "What is there about me to make a wonderful girl love me?",
  "28821": "Had he not been supremely successful?",
  "28822": "Who stopped him?",
  "28823": "Can't you fancy the conclusions he'll draw?",
  "28824": "And what say you to that?",
  "28825": "Why don't you pad?",
  "28826": "Then, where are you now?",
  "28827": "You wouldn't think we'd keep you over time, now, would you?",
  "28828": "Am I to call in any assistance, or is the trick done?",
  "28829": "Why can't you be rational?",
  "28830": "And half of what you had was hers?",
  "28831": "What must they think as they see us sailing in the air?",
  "28832": "Now, will you come upstairs?",
  "28833": "A lump of wax?",
  "28834": "Do you know what it means?",
  "28835": "Is anything the matter, sir?",
  "28836": "Do you think you'll be able to get through?",
  "28837": "Is there no guarantee for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness?",
  "28838": "Then why DO you wait?",
  "28839": "Do you think he is hopeful?",
  "28840": "What will be the conclusion?",
  "28841": "And with you, ma'am?",
  "28842": "Just thinking what?",
  "28843": "You know the contents of this letter, no doubt?",
  "28844": "What do you wonder at?",
  "28845": "Who made these dissimilarities?",
  "28846": "A miser?",
  "28847": "Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the hangman who would gain his fee?",
  "28848": "You know what I mean?",
  "28849": "Can you read it?",
  "28850": "What med you be up to?",
  "28851": "D'you reckon he knowed anything?",
  "28852": "Suppose we sell off all the horses, and sell one of your farms, and pay up square?",
  "28853": "What if he should be no gentleman now, but a clown indeed, lady?",
  "28854": "Who, his parents?",
  "28855": "May I go with you?",
  "28856": "Do you see it?",
  "28857": "Where can you begin?",
  "28858": "Will your eminence please read and examine?",
  "28859": "Why, how in the nation did they ever git into such a scrape?",
  "28860": "Where did the shipwreck occur?",
  "28861": "Did one ever hear of such a thing?",
  "28862": "Is anything the matter?",
  "28863": "What you demand of me is serious, then?",
  "28864": "What then, in the name of heaven, could you go to war for?",
  "28865": "Surely there is no danger of anything so dreadful?",
  "28866": "What must one day come and may not pass by?",
  "28867": "Well, madame?",
  "28868": "Have you got the cartridges?",
  "28869": "To go with you for?",
  "28870": "Don't you think that is extraordinarily generous?",
  "28871": "Is there no debt to pay, no boon to grant?",
  "28872": "You don't expect anybody to believe this, about the lady and the sovereign, do you?",
  "28873": "Then, perhaps, you cannot tell me what sort of a woman she is?",
  "28874": "Ye are frightened?",
  "28875": "But how in the world did you know that he was in the house at all?",
  "28876": "May I venture to congratulate you?",
  "28877": "A successor?",
  "28878": "Shall not we two lie on the bridal bed this same night?",
  "28879": "Did all enjoy it?",
  "28880": "Don't you use a study?",
  "28881": "Isn't it damp?",
  "28882": "How was it wrought to such perfection?",
  "28883": "Am I likely to be frozen?",
  "28884": "A presentation?",
  "28885": "White or brown?",
  "28886": "Does he wish it?",
  "28887": "Why did you?",
  "28888": "The decline of his fortunes, then?",
  "28889": "What was the cause of such degeneration?",
  "28890": "They are coming, then?",
  "28891": "How can you talk about shame, papa?",
  "28892": "Who is to throw a stone?",
  "28893": "How so, my pet?",
  "28894": "Ambulance or train?",
  "28895": "Dare I ask you to explain?",
  "28896": "Only what are we to talk about?",
  "28897": "Will your ladyship honour me with the CONTREDANSE until your coach is ready?",
  "28898": "Again, if there be nothing real in the universe, what is it that causes unreal objects to appear?",
  "28899": "What do you want of me?",
  "28900": "Not the old business?",
  "28901": "Somebody was coming?",
  "28902": "Mad one, what have I said?",
  "28903": "Do you know I am dissatisfied with your younger son?",
  "28904": "In pain, where?",
  "28905": "Doth it long for knowledge as the lion for his food?",
  "28906": "But what other ways?",
  "28907": "So I come and take, and what do I do?",
  "28908": "But why have you no packing bag?",
  "28909": "He does your bidding?",
  "28910": "Had he not better take the big umbrella?",
  "28911": "But of what?",
  "28912": "Shall you be there, sir?",
  "28913": "You didn't know him, did you?",
  "28914": "Mamma, are you asleep?",
  "28915": "Have I not, sir?",
  "28916": "And so many children poor?",
  "28917": "At least, what?",
  "28918": "Are not the roofs and the lintels wet?",
  "28919": "At what time did he go?",
  "28920": "Perfectly plain, isn't it?",
  "28921": "Then how could they tear me pitilessly from all that was dear to me, and lock me up in prison like a wild animal?",
  "28922": "And who's to make him?",
  "28923": "How did the boat strike when she went in?",
  "28924": "How hight she?",
  "28925": "You understand what I mean?",
  "28926": "But is not war an art?",
  "28927": "Postponed?",
  "28928": "She is, is she?",
  "28929": "Who is fit for it?",
  "28930": "Do you not as a rule think women below your notice as companions?",
  "28931": "Will you tell me where the BRITANNIA was wrecked?",
  "28932": "What chance had they against one who, if she had a mind, could put by out of her income twice as much as they, poor women, could spend?",
  "28933": "What mede is aye to live in comfort?",
  "28934": "Who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads?",
  "28935": "Who's over me?",
  "28936": "Why, in the devil's name, have they served me thus?",
  "28937": "You know her husband, of course?",
  "28938": "Is it possible that the meaning of life was not disclosed to him before he died?",
  "28939": "Are you brutes?",
  "28940": "Think it'll ride?",
  "28941": "What'll the other people in the house say to my being here?",
  "28942": "But was it all there was of life?",
  "28943": "What private box?",
  "28944": "A little buttered toast with the tea?",
  "28945": "Nor written?",
  "28946": "Would I not give all that I have of strength at one blow if I could open his eyes to see as I see but for one minute?",
  "28947": "Consequently, a capital blade?",
  "28948": "And break it out?",
  "28949": "He has the horse, then?",
  "28950": "You're not sorry you've come, are you?",
  "28951": "The entrance cannot be easy?",
  "28952": "Why do I not give it?",
  "28953": "And does that hinder you from letting me know the second reason?",
  "28954": "Clarence?",
  "28955": "Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy?",
  "28956": "Why did you play us such a trick, damn you?",
  "28957": "What is his object?",
  "28958": "What would happen next?",
  "28959": "Who might do this but the women?",
  "28960": "Why don't you scream?",
  "28961": "Do you know that?",
  "28962": "Why, my dear friend, do I not see you?",
  "28963": "But, in truth, what is the good of these disguises?",
  "28964": "Will that restore it to sight?",
  "28965": "Where is this person?",
  "28966": "What can a man spend his ha'pence on here in this country hole?",
  "28967": "Catharine, did I do wrong?",
  "28968": "How much are you out of pocket?",
  "28969": "What has become of her?",
  "28970": "Could we advertise, then, asking for information from wharfingers?",
  "28971": "Does this infinite awaken in us the idea of essence, while we can attribute to ourselves only the idea of existence?",
  "28972": "We will say ten o'clock then?",
  "28973": "To its honors, to its flowers, to its golden aspirations?",
  "28974": "But always smelling those leather books, what can be expected?",
  "28975": "Is it not time for a change?",
  "28976": "What did happen to me?",
  "28977": "Do you think now that I shall tell you what motive he had had in starting out?",
  "28978": "You perhaps think I should have expected this refusal?",
  "28979": "And your cargo?",
  "28980": "You do like me a bit, don't you?",
  "28981": "Who was killed in another place?",
  "28982": "What's the game?",
  "28983": "Not related to her, sir?",
  "28984": "But, they say, is that true right, social right, fraternal right?",
  "28985": "Do you know, sir, that that man did all this?",
  "28986": "Did he give you anything else?",
  "28987": "Why should he die, for he felt that he could not live, under such a weight of obloquy?",
  "28988": "It's he then who has told you?",
  "28989": "Is that all?",
  "28990": "Took?",
  "28991": "How much do you know?",
  "28992": "Out of your own pocket?",
  "28993": "Why was it none would give it, then?",
  "28994": "Shall they be banished from the district, or from the whole land?",
  "28995": "Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?",
  "28996": "Did I abuse you?",
  "28997": "And who wants to be acquainted with you?",
  "28998": "What can you do?",
  "28999": "Are you in love with the cows?",
  "29000": "Not to her uncle?",
  "29001": "Why should it not, at a certain depth, attain an impassable limit, instead of rising to such a point as to fuse the most infusible metals?",
  "29002": "But why have you done it at all?",
  "29003": "Haven't you noticed it?",
  "29004": "And what does this groom do?",
  "29005": "Sun in your eyes and his face in the shadow?",
  "29006": "Would she hear of his being slapped and beat by drummers demnebly?",
  "29007": "Who did all that mischief?",
  "29008": "Ain't we gotta live?",
  "29009": "Are we at the pole?",
  "29010": "Do you hear, do you hear what he says?",
  "29011": "Don't you think you could find some work to do?",
  "29012": "Was he again to be disturbed?",
  "29013": "Was she going to act and keep house?",
  "29014": "But why does he have this idea of a horse?",
  "29015": "Was that his work or was it possibly the doing of someone who was bent upon counteracting his schemes?",
  "29016": "Two minutes wrong?",
  "29017": "Do you not guess, monsieur?",
  "29018": "Where's your horse?",
  "29019": "Will you give me something to eat and a bed?",
  "29020": "What would they do to assist them?",
  "29021": "Let us have the land?",
  "29022": "Does he ever pay the rent for you?",
  "29023": "Might I ask you, sir, to pacify my mind?",
  "29024": "It is difficult to rise above the jungle standards and reason by the light of civilized ways, is it not, my friend?",
  "29025": "What about your government and all this treatment?",
  "29026": "What the devil are you doing?",
  "29027": "What help is to be hoped for, what consolation, what solace?",
  "29028": "Or, may we not owe their visit to the dead colt?",
  "29029": "Where shall we search for him?",
  "29030": "Why should you keep such things from me?",
  "29031": "Physiology not an experimental science?",
  "29032": "What about the dough?",
  "29033": "Can she have loved my brother so little as to be able to forget him so soon?",
  "29034": "It wasn't then that she told you?",
  "29035": "What thing?",
  "29036": "Do you suppose she takes you for a symbol?",
  "29037": "No worse news of master, I hope, sir?",
  "29038": "Has she run away because we are come?",
  "29039": "Shall I tell her or not?",
  "29040": "But then, why had he permitted that man to leave him alive?",
  "29041": "What's that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for?",
  "29042": "On which of these actions did he reflect with the most pleasure, when he was summoned by the angel of death?",
  "29043": "How shall I don't?",
  "29044": "What was in there?",
  "29045": "But tell me, what is she?",
  "29046": "Wouldn't you like to be king of that splendid fairyland?",
  "29047": "Have you examined this extract from your report and compared it with the original?",
  "29048": "Is he ungrateful to no one else?",
  "29049": "Aye, how do you know he is?",
  "29050": "Does our friend eke out his modest income with a crossing?",
  "29051": "The stag spoke?",
  "29052": "What are the dangers which menace us?",
  "29053": "Monsieur does not then renounce his excursion for this evening?",
  "29054": "You imagine, I dare say, that you invented something quite new?",
  "29055": "Why shouldn't she win?",
  "29056": "Is there anything in what I say, or am I talking to no purpose?",
  "29057": "Was he already with the queen?",
  "29058": "What is the matter, that with all his ill usage of me, I cannot hate him?",
  "29059": "Now, I beseech you, do tell me, have you ever attended to their pairing and breeding?",
  "29060": "Oh, what have I done to be blessed with such friends?",
  "29061": "Two one pound notes, or friends?",
  "29062": "Can it be that the dog has not understood his master?",
  "29063": "Why indeed should they maintain a watch?",
  "29064": "What was I to do?",
  "29065": "So will you abandon your plan?",
  "29066": "What can I say that will enable you to understand the depth of my sorrow?",
  "29067": "Did she still love him?",
  "29068": "What you 'bout?",
  "29069": "And of the pleasures of love, and all other pleasures, the same holds good?",
  "29070": "What does she want?",
  "29071": "You needn't go yet, need you?",
  "29072": "Will it be safe to leave you there alone?",
  "29073": "How many things she knows, doesn't she?",
  "29074": "In your room?",
  "29075": "Then you won't forgive me?",
  "29076": "Can dignity of mind exist with such trivial cares?",
  "29077": "Ah, friends, do ye divine also my heart's double will?",
  "29078": "Who was th' lad what carried th' flag?",
  "29079": "Are they dead, ma'am?",
  "29080": "And what shall we have in lieu of it?",
  "29081": "It is a lovely night, and why should we not prolong our ride a little?",
  "29082": "Will she then have sufficient native energy to look into herself for comfort, and cultivate her dormant faculties?",
  "29083": "You will not come?",
  "29084": "For arrears of pay?",
  "29085": "Copperfield, my dear fellow, how do you do?",
  "29086": "And is the city which is under a tyrant rich or poor?",
  "29087": "Was it not too clear that, let the matter go how it would, there was no happiness in store for her?",
  "29088": "Would you kindly send one of your constables for two buckets of water?",
  "29089": "But what is there, then, above the sun?",
  "29090": "How is it you don't know?",
  "29091": "Why are they not given up to the church, as they ought to be?",
  "29092": "But you, d'Artagnan, what is the matter with you, and what has happened to you personally?",
  "29093": "To conceal his name?",
  "29094": "Is it at some set season?",
  "29095": "Did she know anything of his life upon the sea?",
  "29096": "Where is so awful a responsibility laid upon them?",
  "29097": "Well, my boy, what's there to prevent you?",
  "29098": "What more natural, after this, than the dream which came to him?",
  "29099": "If vices be genuine and virtue a deception, as you think, why do you call the inventors of that deceiving art sages?",
  "29100": "Has the law any eyes to witness your grief?",
  "29101": "How can I be vain when I know I'm homely?",
  "29102": "The little girl?",
  "29103": "Kicked on that occasion for cheating at dice?",
  "29104": "What proofs do you require?",
  "29105": "On business, eh?",
  "29106": "Why, what's happened?",
  "29107": "Not hurt you, did I?",
  "29108": "Was it the time the sandy cat walked round the balustrade?",
  "29109": "What insults, girl?",
  "29110": "And how does any one know whether he will stay days, months, or years?",
  "29111": "Well, how are you going to get out of that?",
  "29112": "Have you your stethoscope?",
  "29113": "Well, where can we find it?",
  "29114": "Was it mere social effect, fulfilment of ambition in the social world, in the community of mankind?",
  "29115": "How about this ad of yours?",
  "29116": "Do you still suppose that I am a boy ignorant of my own mind, and mistaking the impulses of my own soul?",
  "29117": "Must we then not be married, in order to sanctify the union of our hearts?",
  "29118": "Ay, but will you promise to come?",
  "29119": "What did you write about?",
  "29120": "Perhaps you are laughing again?",
  "29121": "So you think that these people have already quitted the island?",
  "29122": "What's a lad with good friends doing as loblolly boy?",
  "29123": "Who can tell if that mind, when the touchstone is applied to it, will not be found of a mean and vulgar character?",
  "29124": "But what time's breakfast, sir?",
  "29125": "Did you signal us, lording?",
  "29126": "Where was you raised?",
  "29127": "May I read it?",
  "29128": "Where is the treasure?",
  "29129": "You know?",
  "29130": "Snatch at it?",
  "29131": "Well, what say you to a friend that would take this bitter bargain off your hands?",
  "29132": "Just step into this corner a moment, will you?",
  "29133": "What will you do, dear?",
  "29134": "Who shall prevent him?",
  "29135": "Is it a profession?",
  "29136": "You admit you owe him three pounds then for a month's board?",
  "29137": "Have I not found her friendless, and cold, and comfortless?",
  "29138": "Is he learned?",
  "29139": "Ay, where are they?",
  "29140": "Who is there?",
  "29141": "Why should he feel joy at turning back?",
  "29142": "Must I really?",
  "29143": "And shall I not do as the first man?",
  "29144": "Thy work, the KARMA?",
  "29145": "It's queer, isn't it?",
  "29146": "Was I not a fool, when I refused to look at or speak to him?",
  "29147": "And may we say that this has been proven?",
  "29148": "Does she cook the dinner?",
  "29149": "How do you come to know it?",
  "29150": "She was confined at your house, was she not?",
  "29151": "Then why didn't you come to me to wipe them for you?",
  "29152": "Do you know who I am?",
  "29153": "Do you see that woman with the embroidered badge?",
  "29154": "Very well what did I say to you?",
  "29155": "Father, have you any objection to my going away?",
  "29156": "And you are afraid I shall be unhappy?",
  "29157": "To reign in my place and stead?",
  "29158": "I suppose?",
  "29159": "Does the day look clear again?",
  "29160": "What if I were to think a little about others?",
  "29161": "Why on earth did you shut yourself in?",
  "29162": "Do you really suppose?",
  "29163": "Why one to come and one to go?",
  "29164": "Is not that the bishop?",
  "29165": "Why will you ruin yourself, your family, and nation?",
  "29166": "Why such a hard sentence?",
  "29167": "Will he not fancy that the shadows which he formerly saw are truer than the objects which are now shown to him?",
  "29168": "May I go and see her?",
  "29169": "Where did you go this morning?",
  "29170": "So very soon?",
  "29171": "Well, sir, in writing against property, have I done more than quote the language of history?",
  "29172": "I unhappy?",
  "29173": "But do I see a handkerchief?",
  "29174": "But how did he come by his death?",
  "29175": "Can you believe it?",
  "29176": "But if you have big ideas you have to use big words to express them, haven't you?",
  "29177": "Do you think that was done last night?",
  "29178": "Which is the way to the chapel?",
  "29179": "May we, then, be permitted to speak of the past in the present?",
  "29180": "What victim?",
  "29181": "Do we not own the country?",
  "29182": "Raoul, did you ever see anybody hung?",
  "29183": "May I be permitted a word or two of advice?",
  "29184": "If not, where's he gone?",
  "29185": "What would they think of me?",
  "29186": "What says the abbe?",
  "29187": "Might it not be that she would calculate that an interview would thus be possible?",
  "29188": "Why linger to add to the number of the victims of our merciless enemies?",
  "29189": "What is bad?",
  "29190": "And what now?",
  "29191": "Was he actually in hiding from the police?",
  "29192": "Shall he in the meantime risk the character and interest of the nation in the hands of men to whom he can not give his confidence?",
  "29193": "What's the meaning of this?",
  "29194": "In the first place, what is the gentleman's name?",
  "29195": "Don't you want to go out, and walk around the moon, and pick up diamonds?",
  "29196": "But how was it possible to effect this?",
  "29197": "Will you let me?",
  "29198": "And look you, lord, times are not ill, so wherefore should I risk a change of days?",
  "29199": "That certainly seems a satisfactory explanation, does it not?",
  "29200": "Why, I suppose you'll make a dive for a hatful of diamonds, won't you?",
  "29201": "You have my birth certificate?",
  "29202": "Isn't this mattress hard enough, and the room dull enough, and pain bad enough, but THEY must torture me?",
  "29203": "What is our life when compared to theirs?",
  "29204": "Is it an odd speech, papa?",
  "29205": "Why don't we go in with them?",
  "29206": "Had you not observed it before?",
  "29207": "Then why didn't I sneeze?",
  "29208": "Who would attend him when he was sick?",
  "29209": "Till to your very doors the war be brought?",
  "29210": "A sleeping draught?",
  "29211": "What is that black thing down there?",
  "29212": "Philip?",
  "29213": "But they may come any moment, for you left word that I awaited them?",
  "29214": "Why, indeed?",
  "29215": "Shall you?",
  "29216": "But how came the hand to discompose you so much, if it was only a letter of business?",
  "29217": "Why did this sudden conviction of a religious woman cast a terrible doubt in my mind?",
  "29218": "Was that then he or an inhuman thing moved by a lower soul?",
  "29219": "And the power which the eye possesses is a sort of effluence which is dispensed from the sun?",
  "29220": "What was one to think or feel?",
  "29221": "Can you tell the position of the rooms?",
  "29222": "To defend ourselves against attack?",
  "29223": "The child?",
  "29224": "You will marry me, won't you?",
  "29225": "When shall I have the answer, monseigneur?",
  "29226": "But where does it stay?",
  "29227": "D'you like that?",
  "29228": "You know that to be so?",
  "29229": "Was it possible to render any aid to the dying man?",
  "29230": "Widowed mother, perhaps?",
  "29231": "Has she mentioned me lately?",
  "29232": "And what your sorrow?",
  "29233": "Did you speak, my own?",
  "29234": "Is it only a voice?",
  "29235": "Why wonder about this?",
  "29236": "Did he not advertise?",
  "29237": "In what manner?",
  "29238": "What would they do if they found me?",
  "29239": "But how can I pay them?",
  "29240": "How was this done?",
  "29241": "Away from me?",
  "29242": "And, if so, surely there is good material in you?",
  "29243": "It was he did that, and amn't I a great wonder to think I've traced him ten days with that rent in my crown?",
  "29244": "What was the matter with you, baron?",
  "29245": "May I have the honour?",
  "29246": "Will you come into the garden?",
  "29247": "Will it satisfy them, in the future, if we have nothing to do with invasions and insurrections?",
  "29248": "But what are we to do with her when we have caught her?",
  "29249": "And what do you say of lovers of wine?",
  "29250": "Where now the splendid future of her poor duped children?",
  "29251": "So that is what you wanted the money for?",
  "29252": "Would you like to take her place?",
  "29253": "Was it in the papers yet?",
  "29254": "Who lives to the left there?",
  "29255": "Where shall we have tea?",
  "29256": "Would she ever die?",
  "29257": "And had the leather interior lasted with the felt cap through seven centuries?",
  "29258": "But why should anyone take it in order to keep it in his house?",
  "29259": "What will happen now?",
  "29260": "Next, how can the posting be accomplished in these mountainous parts?",
  "29261": "Does your soul belong to him now?",
  "29262": "How is man to know?",
  "29263": "And what can I do for you, esteemed prince?",
  "29264": "But this letter in which he recommends you to me?",
  "29265": "What are bulbs?",
  "29266": "Would you like to ferry me over?",
  "29267": "I hope your respected father is well, sir?",
  "29268": "And what, my lord, has been my fault?",
  "29269": "Then what is the illness itself?",
  "29270": "Is that what you've been so funny about this evening?",
  "29271": "But you are half asleep, are you not?",
  "29272": "Of whom?",
  "29273": "And suppose I were to die?",
  "29274": "I wonder where they do go, by the by?",
  "29275": "Is the well where you got this water near at hand?",
  "29276": "And does your honor know the four men who undertook to rescue him?",
  "29277": "Did you still hear the knocking?",
  "29278": "But to what place was I to go?",
  "29279": "Would you work for four and a half a week?",
  "29280": "You have a child?",
  "29281": "Doesn't the name of the country strike you even in the mere mention of it?",
  "29282": "How shall we punish him for such a speech?",
  "29283": "What can be plainer than that the webbed feet of ducks and geese are formed for swimming?",
  "29284": "The sun?",
  "29285": "Diana?",
  "29286": "But who was she?",
  "29287": "Have you been in others?",
  "29288": "How died he?",
  "29289": "She asked, if she should call me again?",
  "29290": "You won't mind, will you?",
  "29291": "Have you been there long?",
  "29292": "Do I interrupt?",
  "29293": "But it is quite understood, is it not?",
  "29294": "Will you carry him?",
  "29295": "Neither will he ever break faith where there have been oaths or agreements?",
  "29296": "If he comes back again, father?",
  "29297": "But who can tell what had happened?",
  "29298": "What then, I shall be asked, prevents these things from taking place with such regularity and precision?",
  "29299": "Who is the lady?",
  "29300": "Ain't it good enough to be in your book?",
  "29301": "And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?",
  "29302": "Is it not a just retribution?",
  "29303": "And where are the bodies?",
  "29304": "What do you say to coffee?",
  "29305": "Then we are friends?",
  "29306": "What are you thinking of, D'Artagnan?",
  "29307": "It was four years ago that I had it made, and what do you think I chose for the word and figures?",
  "29308": "Can I have missed it?",
  "29309": "Krajiek could 'a' put it there, couldn't he?",
  "29310": "WHICH candle?",
  "29311": "Shall we take their horses out, or tell them to find friends elsewhere as they best can?",
  "29312": "How much longer will you stay here?",
  "29313": "Is yours a hooky or a nobbly?",
  "29314": "And if he were innocent of any wrong, why did he not do something to clear himself?",
  "29315": "And it is to you, you graceless varlet, I owe all this?",
  "29316": "I have spoken of this because I keep wanting to know for a fact whether other people feel such enjoyment?",
  "29317": "Who is the fellow with him?",
  "29318": "And what will happen now?",
  "29319": "Can we be so unwise as to mean, that she shall keep a navy in our harbours for that purpose?",
  "29320": "Well, I don't think there's anything more, is there?",
  "29321": "Do you think that you are going to stay here?",
  "29322": "Are you going away, or has something happened?",
  "29323": "At the point where the path passes through the gate, you could surely pick up the tracks?",
  "29324": "What have we for lunch?",
  "29325": "Then it's a go, eh?",
  "29326": "What is't?",
  "29327": "Because she was there?",
  "29328": "Can you, of all the people who love her, bear to see her so?",
  "29329": "And if we had not arrived, what would you have done?",
  "29330": "Should you like me to take down his hat to him?",
  "29331": "Honest?",
  "29332": "Are all the flowers dead, or do some of them come again in the summer?",
  "29333": "Can one work there?",
  "29334": "Doing?",
  "29335": "I mean, will you be good to us, or do you intend to eat us?",
  "29336": "Will there be roses?",
  "29337": "Who gives you your maintenance, I pray you?",
  "29338": "What makes you pant so, my friend?",
  "29339": "Is it his fault that he is so ugly, and has so little sense?",
  "29340": "And what due or proper thing is given by cookery, and to what?",
  "29341": "Leave him there after what has occurred this morning in this palace?",
  "29342": "Do you take me vor a shicken ?",
  "29343": "Wot good are you?",
  "29344": "What are you to do?",
  "29345": "And why do you ask that?",
  "29346": "What is it, grandmother?",
  "29347": "What's the good of stopping?",
  "29348": "Had I right, for my own benefit, to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations?",
  "29349": "Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?",
  "29350": "You will reach that with nothing to help you but credit?",
  "29351": "By whose means?",
  "29352": "How much do you own?",
  "29353": "And the lakes, cousin, what do you say of them?",
  "29354": "Why don't you go and fetch things?",
  "29355": "Is that possible?",
  "29356": "What do you mean by lagging and a lifer?",
  "29357": "Are there no honest ones?",
  "29358": "And what is THAT to me?",
  "29359": "Are you unwell today?",
  "29360": "Phips had compromised, and why not he?",
  "29361": "To the office?",
  "29362": "Why should he bear all this?",
  "29363": "Successfully, I hope?",
  "29364": "Have you not heard the astonishing intelligence regarding her surreptitious union?",
  "29365": "Yet, what have I got to do with it?",
  "29366": "Still he's not worth her little finger, is he?",
  "29367": "Is the baby all right?",
  "29368": "Has she been stolen?",
  "29369": "Why must she do it?",
  "29370": "And by what means our news to him repeat?",
  "29371": "What in the world was the meaning of this?",
  "29372": "Is it possible that this stranger has now become everything to me?",
  "29373": "Forgive me, won't you, and let me put the poor brute out of his misery?",
  "29374": "The question arises, what disposition are we to make of our accumulating funds?",
  "29375": "Is it of any use for me to tell you again why we must try to part with the house?",
  "29376": "How comes it that you would not answer my greetings for so long?",
  "29377": "And what did the firm say?",
  "29378": "You do think I could do some good at it, if I were to try?",
  "29379": "But what is to be done, old man?",
  "29380": "As they are or as they appear?",
  "29381": "I didn't do wrong, did I?",
  "29382": "What do I want with them?",
  "29383": "Where is that secretary person?",
  "29384": "What could he do, even supposing himself strong enough to fight the battle?",
  "29385": "Can one be too much alive, too happy?",
  "29386": "Who are to be the objects of popular choice?",
  "29387": "But will not the general be too hospitable for you?",
  "29388": "And that's the lad, sir, is it?",
  "29389": "Which road?",
  "29390": "And me?",
  "29391": "Oh, so it's not time to die yet?",
  "29392": "And how is it he has got this power over you, that you promise to marry him against your will?",
  "29393": "How could the devil from hell himself escape alive?",
  "29394": "Why don't you leave him alone?",
  "29395": "And why so late returned?",
  "29396": "What about leaving that bright boy of yours on guard?",
  "29397": "Did ye ever know this?",
  "29398": "Are you content, my beloved?",
  "29399": "Ye that tell us of harmony and reconciliation, can ye restore to us the time that is past?",
  "29400": "If they had said I was niece to a piping bullfinch, what would you care?",
  "29401": "Have you served under the usurper?",
  "29402": "You would want nothing for so doing?",
  "29403": "What's injudicious, hey?",
  "29404": "Who of you heard his evil song?",
  "29405": "On you?",
  "29406": "Why have you come?",
  "29407": "What have I ever known?",
  "29408": "How many times do I love again?",
  "29409": "Then I may reckon on it, your excellency?",
  "29410": "You have heard me?",
  "29411": "You're the son of one and the nephew of the other?",
  "29412": "And at what date?",
  "29413": "Is he to go up for examination?",
  "29414": "Old lady?",
  "29415": "Have you found it?",
  "29416": "Isn't there any help for it?",
  "29417": "Who speaks for this cub?",
  "29418": "Is it not very unwise in us to go on spending the little money we've got when I can keep down expenditures by an honest occupation?",
  "29419": "What ought they to be allowed, or not allowed, to do, be, and suffer?",
  "29420": "How long have you been there?",
  "29421": "Do you wish for a name?",
  "29422": "But what, miss?",
  "29423": "And you never by any chance lose sight of him, I presume?",
  "29424": "Should we go now?",
  "29425": "How is one to vanish partly?",
  "29426": "Who was it that was eaten?",
  "29427": "Can I have another piece?",
  "29428": "Where is the use of the devil in that sentence?",
  "29429": "Whereabouts?",
  "29430": "It is awful, love, isn't it?",
  "29431": "Yet how can I let this knavish dog die and lose the money?",
  "29432": "Or how bear the expense of such a journey?",
  "29433": "I am to drag my present life on, holding its pains at your pleasure, day by day?",
  "29434": "One and all?",
  "29435": "And will the inspection have to be made now?",
  "29436": "You do not understand?",
  "29437": "Always ready?",
  "29438": "Can you get a few men together to go there?",
  "29439": "Shall we allege a musical dispute?",
  "29440": "Is it riveted to the planks?",
  "29441": "What, then, possessed him?",
  "29442": "Have you got it?",
  "29443": "Do you believe you have still a certain amount of it to expend this evening?",
  "29444": "Won't anything make you understand that?",
  "29445": "Wouldn't you rather sit here?",
  "29446": "Then why in the world not?",
  "29447": "What are they then?",
  "29448": "What can you love me for?",
  "29449": "Is he a presentable sort of a person?",
  "29450": "Why do you talk like this to THEM?",
  "29451": "But what was his name?",
  "29452": "What do you mean by gone?",
  "29453": "But why don't you want to take it?",
  "29454": "Is not it what you have often wished to do yourself?",
  "29455": "Would a boat be waiting for us with supplies and letters?",
  "29456": "What must have been his feelings?",
  "29457": "And shall we ever come into our own again?",
  "29458": "What do you want, my pretty?",
  "29459": "Supposing him to be attached to me, would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?",
  "29460": "But suppose she had run against this piece of iron?",
  "29461": "Who will be the jury?",
  "29462": "You think, then, that you can help me more efficaciously than your brothers?",
  "29463": "And do you think it's true?",
  "29464": "Shall there never be a fresh opportunity of trying the ranges of projectiles?",
  "29465": "Did he wake up?",
  "29466": "Was he nice?",
  "29467": "And now what will we do?",
  "29468": "Do you not know?",
  "29469": "Or, perhaps, you are not unprepared for the announcement I have it in charge to make?",
  "29470": "And if that were the case would your honor condemn his action?",
  "29471": "And during these days what shall I do?",
  "29472": "Don't the knives hurt?",
  "29473": "Where have you come from and what is your name?",
  "29474": "But how shall we get back?",
  "29475": "How many of the zechins, your father saved, are still left?",
  "29476": "What are your additions?",
  "29477": "What are the foundations of inequality?",
  "29478": "How did you get it?",
  "29479": "One of those swabs, was he?",
  "29480": "Do you believe he can?",
  "29481": "Who has seen her?",
  "29482": "What did he mean by such a pagan idea?",
  "29483": "Was it because at that time we passed for very rich people, and you were afraid of being refused?",
  "29484": "And besides, what have I done to bring it about?",
  "29485": "Alas, what shall I wretched wight become?",
  "29486": "But suppose it's a woman?",
  "29487": "Why am I to give an account of myself?",
  "29488": "What's that you tell me?",
  "29489": "But you think she wouldn't come?",
  "29490": "What colorable reason could be assigned, in a country so situated, for such vast augmentations of the military force?",
  "29491": "Is this too little?",
  "29492": "For the last three months?",
  "29493": "What could he reply to the deposition of the gendarmes who had arrested him in the very act?",
  "29494": "Where is thy answer, culprit?",
  "29495": "Should a man be considered disgraced because he is deceived, because he is betrayed, robbed?",
  "29496": "You are recovering again?",
  "29497": "What are you blurting out NOW?",
  "29498": "Shall we yield to force?",
  "29499": "Come, I do not ask for the sake of questioning you, but how did you get in?",
  "29500": "What do you wish, gentlemen?",
  "29501": "What does she?",
  "29502": "What, then, is the use of your worship?",
  "29503": "Was the gate open?",
  "29504": "Shall us begin it now?",
  "29505": "A recruit, sir, I understand?",
  "29506": "Sir?",
  "29507": "Yet could a woman who had done even what she had done deserve all this?",
  "29508": "But who would do it?",
  "29509": "Has not your father already his sixth wife?",
  "29510": "I ask, is it not as good a rule for him as it is for me?",
  "29511": "WHAT do you call him?",
  "29512": "Who is coward now?",
  "29513": "Have they nothing better to do?",
  "29514": "But that's remarkably altruistic of you, isn't it?",
  "29515": "Are you feeling any better?",
  "29516": "Do you think I care more for my dress than for my little girl?",
  "29517": "What man of taste and feeling can endure rifacimenti, harmonies, abridgments, expurgated editions?",
  "29518": "Faucheux?",
  "29519": "And do you think that you would be happy with her, or she with you, after what has passed?",
  "29520": "Do you ask their pardon of me?",
  "29521": "Who can possibly have told you I had had that dream?",
  "29522": "And this is the return you make me for all the indulgences I've heaped on you?",
  "29523": "Why not raise it five more?",
  "29524": "Will you let me tell you?",
  "29525": "You allow me?",
  "29526": "A week?",
  "29527": "And yet what else was she to think?",
  "29528": "Say, was my mother rightly slain or not?",
  "29529": "But where is this devotion?",
  "29530": "Where have I got one?",
  "29531": "Does not that content you?",
  "29532": "And what is the difference?",
  "29533": "Why are you merry?",
  "29534": "If you really cannot come to me will you let me come to you?",
  "29535": "What matters it of whom he spoke?",
  "29536": "What did it matter if the message were not intended for him?",
  "29537": "Was ever a respectable gentleman in such an impasse?",
  "29538": "Peas?",
  "29539": "You won't forget how fond you are of me?",
  "29540": "What's the matter now?",
  "29541": "Where is this great spider of yours now?",
  "29542": "What have you done now?",
  "29543": "Did you see nobody concealed while you were there?",
  "29544": "Besides what have we to do with setting the world at defiance?",
  "29545": "It looks as if you were trying to fleece me?",
  "29546": "But why suspect me before the action?",
  "29547": "And you live here?",
  "29548": "What mean you?",
  "29549": "That's good impartial evidence, ain't it?",
  "29550": "Do you think for one moment that this little haystack is enough to feed all the flocks in the whole district?",
  "29551": "What is there more astonishing in all that I have said to you than in what you have told me?",
  "29552": "You will not help me, then?",
  "29553": "Surely you have gone too far?",
  "29554": "But I don't exactly see how we can do that?",
  "29555": "Why should he do it?",
  "29556": "But don't you think she'll know all about it, just the same?",
  "29557": "What is the business you wish to see her about?",
  "29558": "Is there anything more?",
  "29559": "Would you deprive me of one of the most indispensable of my means of livelihood?",
  "29560": "Why, how is this?",
  "29561": "What have made you so down?",
  "29562": "And where may he be now?",
  "29563": "The last time that I see him?",
  "29564": "What is her secret?",
  "29565": "Isn't there some nice girl who'd read and amuse you?",
  "29566": "Have you made this trip before?",
  "29567": "Doesn't that satisfy you?",
  "29568": "I say, stranger, how are ye?",
  "29569": "Is not this so?",
  "29570": "How long were you there?",
  "29571": "Wherein?",
  "29572": "Where, may I ask?",
  "29573": "Who is in this world?",
  "29574": "Doesn't join in with the lads in their games, to get some sort of excitement in this lonely place?",
  "29575": "Well, I wait patiently, do I not?",
  "29576": "Shall I have a cab called?",
  "29577": "And then your negotiations will fail?",
  "29578": "It looks newer than the other things?",
  "29579": "She what?",
  "29580": "Should you like me to stay away?",
  "29581": "What had I to do with him that he should rob me of my sleep?",
  "29582": "Will master come here a moment?",
  "29583": "Can there be an appearance of that which has no form?",
  "29584": "Shall we not?",
  "29585": "Where are you going, you rogue?",
  "29586": "And you are very happy?",
  "29587": "You won't have anything?",
  "29588": "Whither shall I bear my shame?",
  "29589": "What's up, then?",
  "29590": "Of what use are excursions into realms in which no real fruit can ever be gathered?",
  "29591": "And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth?",
  "29592": "But why these workingman's clothes?",
  "29593": "And pray what is the ether?",
  "29594": "But there was some one there?",
  "29595": "Have you already in your mind a plan wholly or partially formed?",
  "29596": "Does he gamble?",
  "29597": "And you are certain that the queen and he did not see each other?",
  "29598": "Shall I go up and see?",
  "29599": "What have they come there to do?",
  "29600": "Do you know I think them exceedingly entertaining and strange?",
  "29601": "Will you let me take your arm as far as my own door?",
  "29602": "How's your wound?",
  "29603": "Did you not say that the dog's name was Z?",
  "29604": "Of what use are these dangerous visits, since we can't recognize him?",
  "29605": "You are the officer on duty, lieutenant of the musketeers, are you?",
  "29606": "Who said anything about killing?",
  "29607": "For the emperor's return?",
  "29608": "Can't you see you've made a mistake?",
  "29609": "Can we safely base our action upon any such vague inference?",
  "29610": "Did tha' do anythin' extra to make thysel' so strong?",
  "29611": "Or do ye go in bare bones, as I may say?",
  "29612": "Now, what is the evidence presented to this body by one of its committees?",
  "29613": "Am I to mark this day with a white stone or a black?",
  "29614": "Liza, do you despise me?",
  "29615": "Come, are you ready?",
  "29616": "Has she ever had any experience?",
  "29617": "What does he want, then?",
  "29618": "Are you tired of me?",
  "29619": "And why should it be set aside?",
  "29620": "You see?",
  "29621": "Is not that the empress with him there?",
  "29622": "We only want to find out whether it is yes or no, don't we?",
  "29623": "For everything?",
  "29624": "Is it in anger or in spite that you wish to go?",
  "29625": "Paid everybody?",
  "29626": "Will the greedy gullet of the penitentiary be satisfied with swallowing him instead of all of them, if they should venture to obey him?",
  "29627": "You will come and see me again before you go, chevalier?",
  "29628": "Why should you say such desperate things?",
  "29629": "You must promise me you'll tell no one else?",
  "29630": "It isn't putting you out or upsetting your plans, I hope, or anything on those lines?",
  "29631": "What's that?",
  "29632": "Not here?",
  "29633": "Birdsburg?",
  "29634": "The count, then, is in the chateau?",
  "29635": "What did you go to the bandstand for?",
  "29636": "But what do you mean by living only for yourself?",
  "29637": "Why, know you not?",
  "29638": "Don't you love me?",
  "29639": "But may I not see my poor child?",
  "29640": "Gone down again?",
  "29641": "Whither are you going?",
  "29642": "How is that letter signed?",
  "29643": "I know you'll excuse the precautions of affection, won't you?",
  "29644": "After all, what's the odds between me and you?",
  "29645": "What rule of political morals trampled under foot?",
  "29646": "Does he play?",
  "29647": "Steerforth?",
  "29648": "Can I help loving him?",
  "29649": "And where was it?",
  "29650": "What will they leave him?",
  "29651": "How can I cross the desert?",
  "29652": "How did you get the idea?",
  "29653": "You were going to drink my wine?",
  "29654": "What's 'cordeon?",
  "29655": "Will you let me?",
  "29656": "Meet?",
  "29657": "Where are you going to next?",
  "29658": "Would it not be so, mother, if we were to meet him in fact?",
  "29659": "Are you going to walk with me a little way?",
  "29660": "Will she find an excuse for the neglect of the knight in the duty of a soldier?",
  "29661": "Why should he shun it?",
  "29662": "Who is safe, if she be convicted of crime?",
  "29663": "Or who so safe from injury as the brother of the great?",
  "29664": "But where did you gather your wisdom?",
  "29665": "What's become of him?",
  "29666": "Do you guarantee it?",
  "29667": "When shall I have done weeping?",
  "29668": "And will she go about in a plain shawl, and a large straw bonnet, carrying tracts and bone soup to her husband's poor parishioners?",
  "29669": "How's the cream of clerkship, eh?",
  "29670": "Can't you wait until dark?",
  "29671": "But what the devil are you hurrying about?",
  "29672": "Are you afraid?",
  "29673": "Why impossible?",
  "29674": "Ah, indeed, vicomte?",
  "29675": "Did she own to herself how different the real man was from that superb young hero whom she had worshipped?",
  "29676": "Has papa gone to bed?",
  "29677": "Must babus do their work on polished teak?",
  "29678": "What is the difference between everlasting bliss, changeless and monotonous, and everlasting suffering?",
  "29679": "What makes you stick your chin up and look in that way?",
  "29680": "Don't I know that at the rate we are living our means won't last long?",
  "29681": "Did he catch sight of himself, therefore much despised by his late political associates?",
  "29682": "Do you mean especially this kind?",
  "29683": "I presume you grew weary of the amusement and dropped it, didn't you?",
  "29684": "And what shall it be to drink?",
  "29685": "How long th' assaults of grief and woes abide?",
  "29686": "Had they run away?",
  "29687": "Not even that?",
  "29688": "What have you been thinking of all this time?",
  "29689": "Have you had it sent where we are to go for it?",
  "29690": "Church?",
  "29691": "So soon?",
  "29692": "Did you hope to escape it because you were four times guilty?",
  "29693": "And these tablets are brought to you that you may add your prayers to those of the faithful, are they?",
  "29694": "Will you bet?",
  "29695": "And you intend to ask him?",
  "29696": "Have you got the entree?",
  "29697": "And what are these masons?",
  "29698": "What may you call his nose, now, my dear?",
  "29699": "What was it you told me?",
  "29700": "Was it you who asked him to drink some of it?",
  "29701": "What about this umbrella?",
  "29702": "But why, silence?",
  "29703": "Scott?",
  "29704": "Who has it?",
  "29705": "Do you think me an utter fool?",
  "29706": "You remember what a beautiful night it was?",
  "29707": "In life?",
  "29708": "Not as a waiter?",
  "29709": "How did you proceed?",
  "29710": "Had it been all his fault?",
  "29711": "Who are you, and why do you seek me?",
  "29712": "Where I put it?",
  "29713": "A'n't I a lonely, forlorn widower?",
  "29714": "What were they doing, and why did they not instantly give the alarm?",
  "29715": "What happened before?",
  "29716": "Then he studied it over and said, couldn't I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl?",
  "29717": "Why will you look at matters in so unfriendly a light?",
  "29718": "Have you asked her?",
  "29719": "Darling one, will you be drawn?",
  "29720": "Who knows?",
  "29721": "And how did the thing happen?",
  "29722": "Will it do us any good, mother?",
  "29723": "A correspondence letter, senor?",
  "29724": "What else did he do?",
  "29725": "Can I help showing that I know what she told me?",
  "29726": "Do you side with him in this?",
  "29727": "Perhaps you would prefer being alone?",
  "29728": "Where were his flatterers now?",
  "29729": "Must I move on, sir?",
  "29730": "And he deceived you, and then deserted?",
  "29731": "Or would it worry you just now?",
  "29732": "Does she say anything about him?",
  "29733": "In the queen's name?",
  "29734": "But how can you expect her to keep her promises better than her more enlightened mistress?",
  "29735": "Is she coming again?",
  "29736": "Which shall it be?",
  "29737": "Danecamp?",
  "29738": "Or, when the monarchy is a child, where then is the wisdom?",
  "29739": "Can she give lessons in anything?",
  "29740": "May the testimony of a whole people be slighted, my master?",
  "29741": "Nervous about you?",
  "29742": "What business is that of yours?",
  "29743": "Is it so?",
  "29744": "Why should he be missing?",
  "29745": "Must I sink down there, and die at once?",
  "29746": "What chance has dead knowledge with experience in any of the transactions between man and man?",
  "29747": "Will they not be happier now?",

  "29750": "Is she, then, your sister?",
  "29751": "Do I look fit to be seen with this little brooch?",
  "29752": "Is the reward of virtue bread?",
  "29753": "And will the minister be there?",
  "29754": "Well, what is it, anyway?",
  "29755": "How de do?",
  "29756": "Am I sure?",
  "29757": "How do I mistake it?",
  "29758": "And how many days will make a month?",
  "29759": "What is that line?",
  "29760": "Of what good is it to recall the semblance of life when I cannot recall the spirit?",
  "29761": "And he did not complain?",
  "29762": "And that?",
  "29763": "And what shall be their education?",
  "29764": "But who are you, pray?",
  "29765": "When did he refuse you anything?",
  "29766": "You will not be so foolhardy as to keep your promise?",
  "29767": "DO I remember her?",
  "29768": "What wonder, then, that his imagination should fail to realise the changes that eight years must have worked?",
  "29769": "But you will love him, papa?",
  "29770": "Is it because the sun is declining to the horizon?",
  "29771": "Do you require my services now?",
  "29772": "So you didn't get it?",
  "29773": "She does play well, doesn't she?",
  "29774": "Does not this comprehend all, in fact?",
  "29775": "See you no difference between my charms and those of other women?",
  "29776": "But what is the danger?",
  "29777": "And have you no remedy for this?",
  "29778": "Have you not seen how shamelessly she favors your rival's suit?",
  "29779": "Shall we bury it again?",
  "29780": "He must have bewitched her, I suppose?",
  "29781": "Why not accord to both equal property?",
  "29782": "Is he a bishop, then?",
  "29783": "Who knows?",
  "29784": "Will you not trust me so far as that?",
  "29785": "Will that be possible?",
  "29786": "McMurdo?",
  "29787": "Fifty pounds?",
  "29788": "You are one of the shipwrecked sailors of the BRITANNIA?",
  "29789": "Can he be dead?",
  "29790": "One hallucination might pass, but two hallucinations?",
  "29791": "Is she there still?",
  "29792": "About this boy, love, in whose company they say you left?",
  "29793": "And the work of the painter is a third?",
  "29794": "Ginger?",
  "29795": "Have you realized what the verdict at the inquest will be?",
  "29796": "You think I speak from wicked selfishness?",
  "29797": "Is HE safe for an hour or two?",
  "29798": "Did not you think him sadly out of spirits?",
  "29799": "Wasn't she joking?",
  "29800": "And, if the footpath is narrow, do you think one woman would make room for another, or would beg pardon as she sweeps by?",
  "29801": "Really, if the lower orders don't set us a good example, what on earth is the use of them?",
  "29802": "Laws, now, is it?",
  "29803": "And who is that young man beside you?",
  "29804": "Of what importance is the manner, monsieur, in which I have learnt what I know, so that I know it?",
  "29805": "Is it the personal and individual element in us, or the spiritual and universal?",
  "29806": "Why, where was the difficulty?",
  "29807": "Who deluded you?",
  "29808": "If the virtuous should be very few in number, how then shall we act?",
  "29809": "But to what family does it belong?",
  "29810": "You don't believe me?",
  "29811": "Who shall gainsay your decision?",
  "29812": "Can't you read?",
  "29813": "Will you walk this way, ma'am?",
  "29814": "And the raiders have never found you here?",
  "29815": "Have you anything to do with it?",
  "29816": "What are your orders?",
  "29817": "Where are your partners, my dears?",
  "29818": "Haven't I a reputation for knowing all about music?",
  "29819": "Fainall, d'ye hear him?",
  "29820": "What do you bring that is good?",
  "29821": "What of the letter?",
  "29822": "But my direction will not be the same as yours, I think?",
  "29823": "Or if we admit a disinterested benevolence in the inferior species, by what rule of analogy can we refuse it in the superior?",
  "29824": "You find the rent too high, do you, sir?",
  "29825": "Then you permit me to go, you are not angry in your heart?",
  "29826": "Has he solved the problem of population?",
  "29827": "Do you despise me for it?",
  "29828": "The count himself?",
  "29829": "Are these waters, then, bare of inhabitants?",
  "29830": "If a layman in giving baptism pour the water before saying the words is the child baptized?",
  "29831": "And about your fits?",
  "29832": "You say you don't?",
  "29833": "Can you spare the time?",
  "29834": "And, in the next place, when called to account for it, did he not disobey their summons?",
  "29835": "What did you come for, then?",
  "29836": "Shall I swear to you, sir?",
  "29837": "What you thinking about?",
  "29838": "Or are they swayed and perverted by the sophistries of worldly policy?",
  "29839": "There isn't a cat in it, for example?",
  "29840": "But could not the cavity be detected by sounding?",
  "29841": "You damned rascal, where do you always hide it?",
  "29842": "What would you have done?",
  "29843": "Have you the secret of that combination?",
  "29844": "Your marriage, you say?",
  "29845": "You DO?",
  "29846": "Why did you force me to leave it?",
  "29847": "But who killed her?",
  "29848": "You have asked for me?",
  "29849": "Can you put me up here, and spare a few days to the strangest business, I promise you, that ever was recorded in fact or fiction?",
  "29850": "Have you ever seen such a creature?",
  "29851": "What makes you believe this?",
  "29852": "What is there so improbable in it?",
  "29853": "Well, what do you say?",
  "29854": "And what besides?",
  "29855": "You know not?",
  "29856": "Was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night?",
  "29857": "What are they then?",
  "29858": "What horror can this be?",
  "29859": "Oh, how can you?",
  "29860": "Furious?",
  "29861": "And you paid him out of the two hundred francs I left you?",
  "29862": "One side of WHAT?",
  "29863": "After all, when one can see stars and skies like that, little disappointments and accidents can't matter so much, can they?",
  "29864": "What was this paper which was stolen?",
  "29865": "Whose horse?",
  "29866": "But where did he come from?",
  "29867": "What was to say or do now?",
  "29868": "Had the doctor anything new to tell you?",
  "29869": "Have you any friends?",
  "29870": "What can be done, thus?",
  "29871": "Fits?",
  "29872": "Now take my arm, will you?",
  "29873": "Can you fly?",
  "29874": "Or of what use is it that this immensity of worlds is visible to man?",
  "29875": "A man mistrustful of everybody?",
  "29876": "Do you think me dupe enough to believe you have not comprehended what it meant?",
  "29877": "Do I know?",

  "29881": "Where is your dispatch?",
  "29882": "What, have you sold all your clocks?",
  "29883": "I suppose you angered him somehow?",
  "29884": "Half way to what?",
  "29885": "Do you know what this is to me?",
  "29886": "And seeing that the thing is so easily done, why do not more people attempt it?",
  "29887": "Who knows but I may?",
  "29888": "Even then what would have been the use of it, seeing that life is to be measured, not by a single hour, but by years?",
  "29889": "Where are the gentlemen?",
  "29890": "What's happened?",
  "29891": "Ne'er a one to be found now?",
  "29892": "And for what?",
  "29893": "Hark you, sir, have you dispatch'd this same?",
  "29894": "Come here much?",
  "29895": "But what shall I say?",
  "29896": "To speak to you about me?",
  "29897": "How are things with you?",
  "29898": "Do you not see that it is with religion as with governments, the most perfect of which would be the denial of all?",
  "29899": "When do you sail?",
  "29900": "Where is the water, wife?",
  "29901": "Why should they brighten their tomahawks and sharpen their knives against each other?",

  "30299": "Was it outside, in the air?",
  "30300": "What would he think?",
  "30301": "That charming young woman with her is her daughter?",
  "30302": "Found your way up here?",
  "30303": "You can read?",
  "30304": "How can you let her?",
  "30305": "What is all this about?",
  "30306": "Why have you hated him?",
  "30307": "Is not this a marvellous thing, that he has forced a passage here?",
  "30308": "Now then, ladies and gentlemen, where are your congratulations?",
  "30309": "When you might be doing decent work among us out there?",
  "30310": "How could she serve me?",
  "30311": "But why have two of each sort?",
  "30312": "Does he not call the other pleasures necessary, under the idea that if there were no necessity for them, he would rather not have them?",
  "30313": "You'd like her for your honeymoon?",
  "30314": "For what are you, my young friend?",
  "30315": "Then you don't think I'll see him again?",
  "30316": "And yet you come here, and tell me such a dreadful lie as you did just now, eh?",
  "30317": "Well, sir, what of this?",
  "30318": "Will you?",
  "30319": "I could not see a woman murdered?",
  "30320": "Do you hear me, some of you?",
  "30321": "If I flee from her, there's a law to punish me?",
  "30322": "Can you not guess?",
  "30323": "Who knows what will come in sight round the bend of the valley there?",
  "30324": "What's the last joke?",
  "30325": "How then do service which offends his shade?",
  "30326": "Then you were not engaged to marry him?",
  "30327": "Did not you ask it for anything?",
  "30328": "Can I speak with him?",
  "30329": "And to feel not exactly dull, but sad?",
  "30330": "Was it near, was it far?",
  "30331": "Wouldn't you, ferryman, like to accept these clothes, which are a nuisance to me, from me?",
  "30332": "Isn't he?",
  "30333": "Neither, I said, can there be any question that the guardian who is to keep anything should have eyes rather than no eyes?",
  "30334": "Damn it, did you then take me along with you for your chaplain, to sing mass and shrive you?",
  "30335": "You asked me for five hundred men, did you not?",
  "30336": "Your mother won't know, and so what's the harm?",
  "30337": "What is the liberty of the press?",
  "30338": "Would she throw away the inestimable advantage of royal protection?",
  "30339": "In whom can we trust?",
  "30340": "Then how is it that you did not go?",
  "30341": "And what reward have they?",
  "30342": "Shan't we try that?",
  "30343": "Would you care to try it?",
  "30344": "See what, sir?",
  "30345": "What else could I say when he asked me?",
  "30346": "Are you willing to carry us through the air wherever we wish to go?",
  "30347": "Suppose it was all a gigantic mistake?",
  "30348": "Why out of the question?",
  "30349": "Is your secret of enough importance to me to spare your life for it?",
  "30350": "Oh?",
  "30351": "What more can I desire?",
  "30352": "What would he say then?",
  "30353": "Where are these lamps?",
  "30354": "Who, mother?",
  "30355": "You are studying topography?",
  "30356": "What rent do you pay here?",
  "30357": "Now, do you want any more?",
  "30358": "Is there anything wrong?",
  "30359": "How could that be possible?",
  "30360": "Hadn't I better have a shave?",
  "30361": "How could angels bear the sight?",
  "30362": "You think it then possible that they really won't have returned?",
  "30363": "What's the answer?",
  "30364": "What do you mean by the proposal you made just now?",
  "30365": "I surmise you also are quits?",
  "30366": "What sort of wood is't?",
  "30367": "Can't any one make him stop?",
  "30368": "Do you consider me so?",
  "30369": "How do I know what I was before?",
  "30370": "Shall I see you again ere my departure?",
  "30371": "Am I alarmed?",
  "30372": "How long a start have they?",
  "30373": "In the second, whence comes it?",
  "30374": "What, monsieur?",
  "30375": "Didn't ye hear a word about them matters and something more, eh?",
  "30376": "Till at last he be?",
  "30377": "And what was there in a simple curl of fair hair to appall that brutal man, familiar with every form of cruelty?",
  "30378": "In love with HER?",
  "30379": "But we would agree to make him rich enough to live, I suppose?",
  "30380": "Would a tablespoon of vanilla be enough for a small layer cake?",
  "30381": "Because I've ordered fiz?",
  "30382": "But why do I say, in this case?",
  "30383": "He will be superintendent?",
  "30384": "Your sentence of death, if any soul hears you?",
  "30385": "What embarrassment?",
  "30386": "How do you do, dear friend?",
  "30387": "Have you got the key, auntie?",
  "30388": "What's a captive?",
  "30389": "Can that, with any sort of justice, be styled a blunder?",
  "30390": "But may I not write a note to tell him why I cannot come?",
  "30391": "Meanin' aour packets?",
  "30392": "Why did he do it?",
  "30393": "Has his housekeeper gone too?",
  "30394": "What do you like?",
  "30395": "You have observed that?",
  "30396": "She and I were like sisters, and now she is gone, will you not let me be like a sister to you in your trouble?",
  "30397": "And is there any opposite to life?",
  "30398": "Well?",
  "30399": "Don't you think that people are most conceited of all about their sensual powers?",
  "30400": "What am I to do if I love nothing but fame and men's esteem?",
  "30401": "What do you see there?",
  "30402": "How should a man tell you who knows everything?",
  "30403": "Of what did he die?",
  "30404": "The convicts?",
  "30405": "Why should I help a man to the means perhaps of winning all I have, unless I considered him my friend?",
  "30406": "Don't you know that their attorneys have noticed us that they have withdrawn the suit?",
  "30407": "Who was ever successful in true love?",
  "30408": "Don't you see that by the very fact of your choosing her you prove that you do not know what is best for you?",
  "30409": "Does he?",
  "30410": "Can't you take my word?",
  "30411": "Don't you feel it, don't you feel you CAN'T be tortured into any more knowledge?",
  "30412": "Why should we not get him?",
  "30413": "Ladislaw?",
  "30414": "Does he accept?",
  "30415": "Could it be possible that she should her have to encounter another amorous swain?",
  "30416": "If I catch him there again, shall I have the right to thrash him and her also?",
  "30417": "Is not this the time for us to go back?",
  "30418": "Very reserved, isn't he?",
  "30419": "Ha, what?",
  "30420": "If so, whose?",
  "30421": "And what do you want to do now?",
  "30422": "And the windows too?",
  "30423": "But do you know, gentlemen, what was the chief point about my spite?",
  "30424": "Is there anything the matter, father?",
  "30425": "How do you cure the shivers?",
  "30426": "You have lost one of your boots?",
  "30427": "How comes it that he is unknown?",
  "30428": "What sort of a man is that?",
  "30429": "You have been into the church?",
  "30430": "Is it so beautiful as all that?",
  "30431": "Well, what are you doing there, then?",
  "30432": "Are you used to burglary, may I ask?",
  "30433": "Can't I come back to your rooms?",
  "30434": "And you are NOT, I presume, eh?",
  "30435": "I wonder why?",
  "30436": "Would he come and see her in spite of his mother?",
  "30437": "Wouldn't you rather come in here, to me?",
  "30438": "And what did they see?",
  "30439": "What sort of lives do the majority of folk lead?",
  "30440": "What in the act of offering?",
  "30441": "What could I say, what could I do?",
  "30442": "Know you which, of all his wives, possessed these in the highest degree?",
  "30443": "If they do this, how are we to know when they mean what they say, and of what value can their evidence on points of culture be reckoned?",
  "30444": "Then the soul is immortal?",
  "30445": "Yes, yes, it's your sting, and you are a wasp, that's what you are, a wasp, do you hear?",
  "30446": "Can a man be too cruel to his mother's enemy?",
  "30447": "What child can that be?",
  "30448": "We are to meet as usual?",
  "30449": "Why can I not, on the contrary, say ill enough of her to prevent your going to her?",
  "30450": "But there's good art in me?",
  "30451": "Where is the commander in chief?",
  "30452": "And how do you like it?",
  "30453": "And higher still?",
  "30454": "What does that matter to me?",
  "30455": "Shall I tell you how it will be?",
  "30456": "And who are the really clever men, after all?",
  "30457": "For what other reason can you have laid your plans to talk in this way to such a woman as I am?",
  "30458": "It may come to that, that we must leave this place, but till that time comes, why should your young days be clouded?",
  "30459": "You won't do it again, eh?",
  "30460": "Why then does their rump look toward heaven?",
  "30461": "Has he not all the tricks of a demon at his command?",
  "30462": "What intonation of voice?",
  "30463": "You are coming to sup with me, are you not?",
  "30464": "Making ready for a move?",
  "30465": "But you guess it now, do you not?",
  "30466": "What was it he saw that made his heart stand still?",
  "30467": "Wasn't it all for your good, viper?",
  "30468": "Alas, what would become of me who can only atone for evil by doing good?",
  "30469": "Is the case so desperate?",
  "30470": "What did he do that for?",
  "30471": "Whether shall the red or the blue be annihilated?",
  "30472": "If it was indeed that she had in her own person a dual existence, what might happen when the two existences became one?",
  "30473": "If there be no water of unchanging fluidity, how can there be the unreal and temporary forms of waves?",
  "30474": "You are here already, are you, my gentleman?",
  "30475": "Who are you, dear?",
  "30476": "Waste?",
  "30477": "Then what would you like to do until your uncle comes back?",
  "30478": "If you can't see it yourself, why try to debar me?",
  "30479": "Bless the girl, what are you shivering about?",
  "30480": "Said he, and stamped with his foot, am I to be questioned thus by such a one as you?",
  "30481": "Then where is he?",
  "30482": "Were you obliged to have medical attendance?",
  "30483": "Has any horse got loose?",
  "30484": "And after him have you had no love?",
  "30485": "Where have you had your information?",
  "30486": "What is your meaning?",
  "30487": "With YOU?",
  "30488": "Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?",
  "30489": "What is a man the worse for dying?",
  "30490": "What constitutional maxim is there which applies to the former and not to the latter?",
  "30491": "Shall I arrange?",
  "30492": "Deer?",
  "30493": "Orders?",
  "30494": "Well and did you think they resembled feathered arrows when they were flying?",
  "30495": "He may have reported to you what he pleased, but could not I do the same by him?",
  "30496": "Why doesn't he get something to do?",
  "30497": "Why couldn't he have made up his mind last night?",
  "30498": "Who doubts that?",
  "30499": "Why, to accuse the man, do you address the woman?",
  "30500": "Have I any time to spare?",
  "30501": "Well, what does she want now?",
  "30502": "Haven't you got anything worse than this?",
  "30503": "But do you know why I am saying all this?",
  "30504": "Do you not come in the king's name?",
  "30505": "Shall we dress it here, as usual?",
  "30506": "Why should I fright ye?",
  "30507": "Between whom?",
  "30508": "Will you be my ally, my lady?",
  "30509": "Now then, where's your chief's quarters?",
  "30510": "Is that an aphorism or a cliche?",
  "30511": "What meaneth this restless wagging of her slouchy chaps?",
  "30512": "It gives a lonely man a sort of hankering, doesn't it?",
  "30513": "Ain't you afraid of it, sir?",
  "30514": "And anything else?",
  "30515": "You really won't meet the rest of them?",
  "30516": "How do I know it?",
  "30517": "But what's to be done?",
  "30518": "What is a trousseau?",
  "30519": "Where's the burnisher?",
  "30520": "The ruler may impose the laws and institutions which we have been describing, and the citizens may possibly be willing to obey them?",
  "30521": "You did not send to me?",
  "30522": "Monsieur, can you expose me to the cruel trial of never seeing you again?",
  "30523": "The kind that wear skins?",
  "30524": "Who shall say what he did think?",
  "30525": "Yet is it tangible and real wealth?",
  "30526": "Of work as well?",
  "30527": "Would it not be better if the end did come, the very end?",
  "30528": "No, never?",
  "30529": "Has the whelp been playing that game long?",
  "30530": "Is there no mission in thy native land, O planeticose and exallotriote spirit?",
  "30531": "Would we make any office hereditary that required wisdom and abilities to fill it?",
  "30532": "And what has he said to that?",
  "30533": "And your friend still longs to be made a baron?",
  "30534": "Would you tell me, please?",
  "30535": "Did you put any thing particular in it?",
  "30536": "But would the end really be his own convenience?",
  "30537": "What is the real value of this system of metaphysics, purified by criticism, and thereby reduced to a permanent condition?",
  "30538": "I suppose I'd better not come back with him?",
  "30539": "Does a flower appeal to him?",
  "30540": "Yes, she's as good as they make 'em, and she's all the female I possess and spoiled in consequence, aren't you, old girl?",
  "30541": "What do you know?",
  "30542": "What then could I against the will of heaven?",
  "30543": "Will you allow me to whisper half a syllable, sir?",
  "30544": "Whence arises this fault?",
  "30545": "Would you like a cup of tea?",
  "30546": "In this state of the case, my friends, why is the country agitated?",
  "30547": "You are rich, then, I suppose?",
  "30548": "But how about the tennis?",
  "30549": "Did he mean that literally?",
  "30550": "But tell me, has your father had you entered on the registers of his phratria?",
  "30551": "Hadn't you better say two fifty?",
  "30552": "If the infected were removed, why not mention it?",
  "30553": "Which is it to be?",
  "30554": "Then he will no more have true opinion than he will have knowledge about the goodness or badness of his imitations?",
  "30555": "You have seen him?",
  "30556": "What men are safe if this is done?",
  "30557": "Does she think so?",
  "30558": "Why don't you ask him?",
  "30559": "Does it hurt to be invis'ble?",
  "30560": "You don't think I do it because I like it, do you?",
  "30561": "Is that correct?",
  "30562": "Girl number twenty, isn't this a prosperous nation, and a'n't you in a thriving state?",
  "30563": "Had you, then, that sum?",
  "30564": "Our lease expires when?",
  "30565": "Who are you who speaks out of the darkness?",
  "30566": "Are they to have the fame of such as they go through, and we the labour?",
  "30567": "Yes, yes, it should be a pleasure, the greatest of all, perhaps, for is not killing the next thing to creating?",
  "30568": "Should you also like to be maid of honor?",
  "30569": "What discovery?",
  "30570": "What shall we do with our sleds?",
  "30571": "What big house is that just ahead, please?",
  "30572": "What will you do with yourself for the time?",
  "30573": "You have kissed the queen's hand?",
  "30574": "But when will that come to pass?",
  "30575": "Will you promise?",
  "30576": "Why do you give me this shame?",
  "30577": "Its name?",
  "30578": "I say, why have you been so rotten since I came back?",
  "30579": "On what subject shall I converse with her?",
  "30580": "Have you taken any precautions?",
  "30581": "You have unmasked this false prince also?",
  "30582": "Were you walking in your sleep?",
  "30583": "Won't you love me?",
  "30584": "Are you aware, sir, that we have gone to enormous expense to resist this iniquitous attempt of yours?",
  "30585": "Will you hold the horse while I stick them on?",
  "30586": "Well, then, I must go?",
  "30587": "Is it the solitary cell you want?",
  "30588": "An't you cold?",
  "30589": "Have you anything to say?",
  "30590": "You were not surprised, I dare say?",
  "30591": "How can I help laws?",
  "30592": "You could not tell vs if his sonne were there?",
  "30593": "Do you mean to say you don't hear anything?",
  "30594": "Who is his master?",
  "30595": "No garters?",
  "30596": "What is it that you think I shall do?",
  "30597": "What, you here too, prince?",
  "30598": "What in the world was this hall used for?",
  "30599": "Who would believe him?",
  "30600": "Offended me, boy?",
  "30601": "You know how to support losses?",
  "30602": "What were they doing now?",
  "30603": "I guess you'll mind your parts o' speech, and study the ACCIDENCE agin afore you let your clapper run arter that fashion, won't you?",
  "30604": "Then we should be able to ascertain if the BRITANNIA had left any traces of her shipwreck there?",
  "30605": "What are you going to flog that man for, sir?",
  "30606": "What is he going to do?",
  "30607": "Must we always kill the people?",
  "30608": "Now what was the colonel to do?",
  "30609": "May I ask what is the cause of this unseemly noise?",
  "30610": "If it should break forth into a storm, who can insure us that in its progress a part of its fury would not be spent upon us?",
  "30611": "I'm going to be good, but can't you be good running round just as well as sitting still?",
  "30612": "How can we prevent that?",
  "30613": "Can't we go overside a piece?",
  "30614": "Might I come some other day?",
  "30615": "Go for a soldier, do you mean?",
  "30616": "But what did the mere reckoning of years matter when he felt as young in heart as he had been twenty years ago?",
  "30617": "How could a garden be shut up?",
  "30618": "Your wife or your daughter?",
  "30619": "So that you could see he knew what was between the two wretches?",
  "30620": "But who is there in the world that can boast of having fathomed or understood the wavering mind and unstable nature of a woman?",
  "30621": "Did you ever behold streets so insufferably narrow, or houses so miraculously tall?",
  "30622": "How can they know?",
  "30623": "Is it to make me a captain?",
  "30624": "What IS the matter with it?",
  "30625": "Would that surprise you?",
  "30626": "But would he come?",
  "30627": "How do you know I was praying, sir?",
  "30628": "Who looks after the sick here?",
  "30629": "Can'tyou walk yet?",
  "30630": "Who can make him out?",
  "30631": "To whom do I address it?",
  "30632": "But where was mine?",
  "30633": "Am I, indeed, so happy?",
  "30634": "Hemlock, do you mean?",
  "30635": "How could you possibly know that?",
  "30636": "Why so insensible to my uncle's interests?",
  "30637": "And the possibility has been acknowledged?",
  "30638": "Your ruin?",
  "30639": "Do you mean in point of reward?",
  "30640": "But how long have you been here that you are ignorant of all this?",
  "30641": "Haven't you put a drop of poison in that remark now, eh?",
  "30642": "Would there ever come to him a time of freedom?",
  "30643": "Will you bear, therefore, will you bear to see your sanctuary trampled on?",
  "30644": "Even if the squire should afterwards hear of his having been there, what would it matter?",
  "30645": "She said I was prudent and virtuous?",
  "30646": "How are you to get away from here?",
  "30647": "You are confident that the thief came in a cab?",
  "30648": "That's what it always comes to, doesn't it?",
  "30649": "What could he want?",
  "30650": "That was something in this way, warn't it?",
  "30651": "Why not have kept hold of it with both hands, with both knees, when it was about to flee from her?",
  "30652": "But to what does all this lead?",
  "30653": "Hasn't she always you?",
  "30654": "How do the bass chords run?",
  "30655": "Shall I send the servant to direct you?",
  "30656": "How much is the whole?",
  "30657": "And who instructed you, eh?",
  "30658": "Do you know anything of his history?",
  "30659": "Was she ever as pretty as my mother is now?",
  "30660": "But the puzzle is, who are the teachers?",
  "30661": "How could you be cruel to me?",
  "30662": "But well carried out, eh?",
  "30663": "How did you fare?",
  "30664": "Who does it come from?",
  "30665": "What happened within her?",
  "30666": "Whom had he to consult but himself now?",
  "30667": "What differences from terrestrial conditions will ensue?",
  "30668": "Isn't there a lot of hope in it?",
  "30669": "What stable?",
  "30670": "Do I look ugly?",
  "30671": "To relieve thy breast?",
  "30672": "Can you lift me into that tree and put a rifle in my hands?",
  "30673": "Shall I tell you what you were thinking to yourself just then?",
  "30674": "But what can I have to relate to you?",
  "30675": "Why is that woman always out of the way when she is most wanted?",
  "30676": "I hope you don't mind?",
  "30677": "What right had they to make me suffer like that?",
  "30678": "How long do you suppose this sea to be?",
  "30679": "Do you desire it as ardently as you say?",
  "30680": "If nature suddenly should give that beast a tail, would he not be prouder of it than all the other foxes in the wood?",

  "31490": "What is it, mother?",
  "31491": "Is all of it my fault?",
  "31492": "Has it lied?",
  "31493": "But what turned out to be the case?",
  "31494": "Are you angry then?",
  "31495": "At what value do you estimate your horse and cabriolet?",

  "31502": "Perhaps YOU don't?",
  "31503": "Where are you from?",
  "31504": "What, these waggons may coldly exclude?",
  "31505": "Does not the divine appear to you to be that which naturally orders and rules, and the mortal to be that which is subject and servant?",
  "31506": "Is it not probable that one who, out of doors, goes thus exposed to the cold, must want food and other necessaries at home?",
  "31507": "Where am I to find him?",
  "31508": "Did he come on purpose?",
  "31509": "Where in the world am I to look for him?",
  "31510": "Are you a knight of those two orders, monsieur?",
  "31511": "Now can you conceive of any interest that your heroic deputy could possibly have had in the destruction of that letter?",
  "31512": "Where are you staying?",
  "31513": "What pretense is there for it?",
  "31514": "You wished to see me?",

  "31520": "Will you have some junket?",
  "31521": "I don't say it wasn't handsome in you to keep my man so close, do I?",
  "31522": "Is it possible to insult you, madame?",
  "31523": "Are they growing into worthy citizens, eh?",
  "31524": "How should you, a wheelwright, have anything to say about the book which I am reading?",
  "31525": "Did he really say so?",
  "31526": "But wherefore reveal, and wherefore warn?",
  "31527": "Is he hidden?",
  "31528": "It's you, then, is it?",
  "31529": "What's it been asking of?",
  "31530": "MY MASS?",
  "31531": "Well, captain, what are we stopping for?",
  "31532": "Who are you, and where did you come from?",
  "31533": "And he WILL be a sweep, will he?",

  "31545": "Can't you see, I'm not well?",
  "31546": "And what is the news?",
  "31547": "Has he so little pity or compunction?",
  "31548": "What can I say more?",
  "31549": "Your two attendants disappeared?",
  "31550": "To be suffocated?",
  "31551": "Whose fault was it?",
  "31552": "Then where's the difficulty?",
  "31553": "Did, eh?",
  "31554": "And shall we let a mawkish sentiment sweep away the culture of our fathers or the hope of our children?",
  "31555": "Who comprehends her?",
  "31556": "Do you think they will?",
  "31557": "Look what I've said, will that persuade him?",
  "31558": "What if cruelty had grown into a common passion?",
  "31559": "It must be a hoax, and yet, if it were a hoax, what was I to make of it?",
  "31560": "Besides, what is there to be afraid of?",

  "31566": "Milady is fair, you say?",
  "31567": "Does one ring a bell or shout a bit?",
  "31568": "Am I uglier?",
  "31569": "Oh, why had she refused to leave earlier?",
  "31570": "I forgot, how are you?",
  "31571": "Where is your scorn of convention gone?",
  "31572": "Why should you, with so much energy and talent?",
  "31573": "Have you any pain?",
  "31574": "How could it be possible to make the unmoral being moral or immoral?",
  "31575": "Is his merit, on that account, a lesser one?",
  "31576": "Did she?",
  "31577": "And is not the love of learning the love of wisdom, which is philosophy?",
  "31578": "Are you so everlastin' anxious to land him alone?",
  "31579": "What colour do you want the mare to be?",
  "31580": "You are afraid of something?",
  "31581": "And how did he get it?",
  "31582": "He is paid for his pastime, isn't he?",
  "31583": "Is not that a mean whereby we do acknowledge him to be the sole giver of all whatsoever is good?",
  "31584": "What was going to happen?",
  "31585": "Are you reckoning on his money?",
  "31586": "Why has he come to spoil it all?",
  "31587": "Sorry for what?",
  "31588": "What o'clock was it?",
  "31589": "And do you believe that I love you with all my heart and all my strength and all my soul?",
  "31590": "Why do you change like this?",
  "31591": "Is it a broad sheet of water?",
  "31592": "Do you understand this feeling?",
  "31593": "Where does that man live?",
  "31594": "Would you be willing to sell your inn?",
  "31595": "What do you want to do with him?",
  "31596": "Then you ARE going to be married, sir?",
  "31597": "What means your ladyship?",
  "31598": "What, then, is a race?",
  "31599": "She wasn't by any chance one of the samurai?",
  "31600": "To whom does it belong?",
  "31601": "But why is this man absent?",
  "31602": "Could that great white, unbroken plain over there be real, or was it only an illusion?",
  "31603": "What sundial?",
  "31604": "Could this too be a proud rejection of sympathy and help?",
  "31605": "A fine room, is it not?",
  "31606": "Do I?",
  "31607": "If there is no love, what is there?",
  "31608": "Will you kiss me on it then?",
  "31609": "Why stay ye not when ye come?",
  "31610": "What do you think is the point his negotiations put most forward?",
  "31611": "And then what do you do?",
  "31612": "Is being in love conspiring?",
  "31613": "What do you think he will do?",
  "31614": "Yes or no?",
  "31615": "Do you not see these men still fear you, go in dread of you?",

  "31618": "Have you loved many women before me?",
  "31619": "Can you reconstruct the real face from them?",
  "31620": "Shall I?",
  "31621": "Can you ask it?",
  "31622": "Is he a farmer?",
  "31623": "And can ye still his cold remains pursue?",
  "31624": "No, how could she?",
  "31625": "Will you forget me?",
  "31626": "Are little things more subtle than big things?",
  "31627": "In what part of the house?",
  "31628": "My purse?",
  "31629": "What could I do but bow acceptance?",
  "31630": "Is there anyone with her?",
  "31631": "Replied I, what can I say?",
  "31632": "And your tongue does not refuse to utter this, and your heart does not shrink with shame while you do it?",
  "31633": "What am I to do myself?",
  "31634": "Isn't a man's idea usually what he does marry for?",
  "31635": "What does it strike you is the inference?",
  "31636": "On your honor is that true?",
  "31637": "And did he go home?",
  "31638": "But, comte tell me a reason for it?",
  "31639": "What objection could be made to him?",
  "31640": "Brought you down from whar?",
  "31641": "Why so, my dear child?",
  "31642": "What was he to say to her?",
  "31643": "Isn't he a splendid fellow?",
  "31644": "And where are you going?",
  "31645": "What is yours?",
  "31646": "And what devil made me go to that wat?",
  "31647": "You tell me he burned the letter?",
  "31648": "Jest hear 'em squeal, won't yer?",
  "31649": "And you have corresponded with her all this while?",
  "31650": "Madeline, my dear, I didn't know this person was in your debt?",
  "31651": "What brought it to pass?",
  "31652": "Why sit we not?",
  "31653": "What do you bewail, then, and why do you weep?",
  "31654": "Do you know what's going to become of YOU?",
  "31655": "Why, why' have I made this evening such a point of our not all dining together?",
  "31656": "Falling?",
  "31657": "Whatten penance will ye dree for that?",
  "31658": "Was he going to rebuild?",
  "31659": "Do you mean he will not be contented with violet stockings, and that he wants a red hat?",
  "31660": "What could he be dreaming of?",
  "31661": "And you won't tell me what you want it for?",
  "31662": "Have you heard if he was much hurt?",
  "31663": "And how so?",
  "31664": "What do I make of it?",
  "31665": "All that tempest, all that cloud, that war, then that peace?",
  "31666": "But what motive had they in advising, from which so great a disaster was the result?",
  "31667": "What is the news?",
  "31668": "Well, then, what does the rest of 'em do?",
  "31669": "How else do you think I could educate them at all?",
  "31670": "How far is it now to the inn?",
  "31671": "Why do you feel so bad about that affair of this morning?",
  "31672": "Do you know the relief that my disappearance will be?",
  "31673": "Do you think so now?",
  "31674": "Or will he be carried away by the stream?",
  "31675": "Have you forgotten that when you were in trouble I did everything for you?",
  "31676": "But what is it, then, that I am accused of?",
  "31677": "Odd, wasn't it?",
  "31678": "Have you ever really loved anybody?",
  "31679": "Or that night, when I frowned at him?",
  "31680": "With the prince still?",
  "31681": "And a young lover come and carried off the bride, eh?",
  "31682": "Who hindered his coming to the house?",
  "31683": "Do you recognize that, miss?",
  "31684": "Had not all the other places refused her because she did not know something or other?",
  "31685": "What could be the trouble?",
  "31686": "Sparsit, ma'am?",

  "31691": "Well, then, how is it that your eminence complained just now of want of information?",
  "31692": "Here, on the verandah?",
  "31693": "And how could this be properly explained to the young lady in gentle terms?",
  "31694": "Do you think it's because I'm really bad and unregenerate?",
  "31695": "Are you not?",
  "31696": "Then how about our position?",
  "31697": "And will he not?",
  "31698": "What recompense can we present?",
  "31699": "You won't be very cross, will you?",
  "31700": "The principle is the same, I think?",
  "31701": "What happens in so many cases?",
  "31702": "You are a precious set of people, ain't you?",
  "31703": "Why don't you send home for another?",
  "31704": "And since then?",
  "31705": "And as to her face, could it inspire nothing but passion?",
  "31706": "What was it then, and how had it affected his fate?",
  "31707": "Manager to a diamond merchant, or some such thing, is he not?",
  "31708": "And he does forgive?",
  "31709": "When all that failed, he boldly accosted him, and asked him, whether he did not remember him?",
  "31710": "Or, whither he should go?",
  "31711": "But we shall see you at the musicale this afternoon, shall we not?",
  "31712": "Should possibilities be worse to bear than certainties?",
  "31713": "Has the post come in?",
  "31714": "And when is this to be consummated?",
  "31715": "And what did they say?",

  "31718": "Do you want to work?",
  "31719": "Why are we now in the mansions of the rich and great, my friends?",
  "31720": "Are there many more?",
  "31721": "Didn't you take your story out of THE SEA LION?",
  "31722": "You can stay some time?",
  "31723": "What had occurred since, calculated to change his and my relative positions?",
  "31724": "The other side of WHAT?",
  "31725": "And you swim?",
  "31726": "Was he commencing to suspect?",
  "31727": "And in like manner does the touch adequately perceive the qualities of thickness or thinness, or softness or hardness?",
  "31728": "When you came in at the gate and asked the watchman the way here, had you any one with you?",
  "31729": "Won't you speak to me?",
  "31730": "Where did your instructions come from?",
  "31731": "Why, then, monseigneur does not know?",
  "31732": "But, gentlemen, why are you getting angry again?",
  "31733": "And now it is you who have brought them together again?",
  "31734": "Was there not a spirit in him which, silent as it was, burned on him like the fires of perdition?",
  "31735": "Hurt you?",
  "31736": "What visions, they asked, could one but read them, must lie behind the quiet, dreaming eyes of that inscrutable face?",
  "31737": "What resources could they expect to find upon that scene of desolation?",
  "31738": "May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?",
  "31739": "Are you reconciled?",
  "31740": "Are you nothing?",
  "31741": "But what could have frightened the creatures so, and driven them from their haunts, when they ought to have been quietly sleeping?",
  "31742": "Or would you include the mixed?",
  "31743": "Was it a screw or thrust?",
  "31744": "Ah, then, is THAT what you've stayed over for?",
  "31745": "Do you know that he's the honestest and faithfullest fellow that ever lived, and that he has an irreproachable good name?",
  "31746": "What do you think of it, now?",
  "31747": "Why not?",
  "31748": "Always busy at what?",
  "31749": "How is it possible for him to be attained to?",
  "31750": "Fine, isn't it?",
  "31751": "Is it finished?",
  "31752": "What do you mean?",
  "31753": "He was to be another father to him, and they were all to live together in a garden of roses, weren't they?",
  "31754": "Do you hesitate?",
  "31755": "Is there any one in the lobby?",
  "31756": "I like the baron, but what better gifts can marriage bestow, than I already possess?",
  "31757": "Is not that saying illustrated by this?",
  "31758": "What's he?",
  "31759": "Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?",
  "31760": "Silver?",
  "31761": "Are we going to continue this pace all night?",
  "31762": "Can I be so lucky as to find what everybody is seeking for?",
  "31763": "Face?",
  "31764": "What else have you done?",
  "31765": "Haven't you given her any warning of your arrival?",
  "31766": "It stung you up a bit when I spoke of your game leg, young fellow?",
  "31767": "Sire, will you allow me to speak frankly as befits a loyal soldier?",
  "31768": "Then why speak to me about it?",
  "31769": "What the devil do I do?",
  "31770": "Who would ever know?",
  "31771": "Well, but they'll see how small you are afterwards, won't they?",
  "31772": "Was I very gleeful, settled, content, during the hours I passed in yonder bare, humble schoolroom this morning and afternoon?",
  "31773": "Who will shrive the poor wretch, if you have come away from him?",
  "31774": "Why should I do so?",
  "31775": "Is there no mistake?",
  "31776": "Must he not have the qualities of a sage?",
  "31777": "You don't want to?",
  "31778": "Why is the sycophant thus added to the hypocrite, and the man who pretends to govern, sunk into the humble and submissive memorialist?",
  "31779": "Well, have we attained our end there also?",
  "31780": "From the dry rock who bade the waters flow?",
  "31781": "Do you observe that we were not far wrong in our guess that temperance was a sort of harmony?",
  "31782": "Whatever her sins, they were not sins of intention, but of inadvertence, and why should she have been punished so persistently?",
  "31783": "What was the bargain?",
  "31784": "And his dog also?",
  "31785": "Must I call you a liar as well as a thief?",
  "31786": "Why did you bring me here?",
  "31787": "If he could not speak, how was she to do so?",
  "31788": "And he will accomplish the trip?",
  "31789": "Is he mad?",
  "31790": "What is she there for?",
  "31791": "YOU insulted ME?",
  "31792": "Will you come along home wi' me, and see my wife?",
  "31793": "And now, matey, did that doctor say how long I was to lie here in this old berth?",
  "31794": "My companion?",
  "31795": "For how can one?",
  "31796": "Game for a morning drive?",
  "31797": "You know where you left the team?",
  "31798": "How much have you lost?",
  "31799": "The boy's name?",
  "31800": "Why do you want to start on that again?",
  "31801": "But have we not all been misled about our heroes and changed our opinions a hundred times?",
  "31802": "And you yourself, what do you think about it?",
  "31803": "Why do you say I do not regard it?",
  "31804": "Must we, then, give up to despair?",
  "31805": "But where the devil are you?",
  "31806": "Living?",
  "31807": "Do you know what you have said?",
  "31808": "But where the devil were you gladding last night, my young master?",
  "31809": "Well, and what has she been doing?",
  "31810": "You think I can't shoot me a fox?",
  "31811": "Shall we not spend our immortal life together?",
  "31812": "Would this political deterrence prove acceptable to allies and to our own public?",
  "31813": "Should not all they be called mercenary who are always seeking consolations?",
  "31814": "Where is it, then?",
  "31815": "Do you really mean that?",
  "31816": "How could you get across?",
  "31817": "Can I take her into the spare room to lay off her hat when she comes?",
  "31818": "I did not know his wife, but she was a woman, wasn't she?",

  "31820": "And the sago?",
  "31821": "You have not wanted for anything, vicomte, in my absence, have you?",
  "31822": "Who knows the will of heaven?",
  "31823": "What's that?",
  "31824": "Who's the object of your meditation, sir?",
  "31825": "Would you not say that he is entirely concerned with the soul and not with the body?",
  "31826": "Have we not?",
  "31827": "Who knows whether a sort of infernal glow would not have lingered behind it on the brow of that angel?",
  "31828": "What does she think herself about him?",
  "31829": "Do you hate me so much as all that?",
  "31830": "Is not this to be rich?",
  "31831": "Should you like to retire at once?",
  "31832": "Will you ever go back?",

  "32464": "And will he talk thus of affairs in presence of two strangers?",
  "32465": "What would the issue of it be?",
  "32466": "And why?",
  "32467": "Oh, what's that ugly red streak inside your arm?",
  "32468": "How long you been this way?",
  "32469": "But all this entails expense, and upon whom is this to fall?",
  "32470": "Is this the origin of the zodiacal light?",
  "32471": "With such alternatives, what would be the fate of the travelers?",
  "32472": "Is the fracture recent?",
  "32473": "Now are you ready to tell, boys?",
  "32474": "Have you so much ingratitude and injustice to give credit, against your friend, to the aspersions of two such mercenary trulls?",
  "32475": "I suppose you have a garage there?",
  "32476": "That would meet the situation?",
  "32477": "Was this well done, young gentleman?",

  "32484": "Who brought it into this room, then?",
  "32485": "But who do you suppose our other friend is?",
  "32486": "Why do you wish you were dead?",
  "32487": "Why, what do I keep you for?",
  "32488": "And JIM?",
  "32489": "But, pray, what pretty neat damsel was with you?",
  "32490": "Just like one of the peasants, all day long?",
  "32491": "Little boy, what do you want?",
  "32492": "Why shouldn't a woman?",
  "32493": "Where is there any water?",
  "32494": "How could I say such cruel things to her?",

  "32500": "Leave tonight?",
  "32501": "What would you throw out?",
  "32502": "How would you like being kept awake for an hour in the middle of the night because her ladyship wouldn't go to sleep?",
  "32503": "What did the king say to you?",
  "32504": "Should I be getting your teas ready, while you do that?",
  "32505": "Do you know me?",
  "32506": "What vessel is that?",
  "32507": "Or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected?",

  "32509": "Why are we there ?",
  "32510": "Not even me?",
  "32511": "Ah, ha, that's it, is it?",
  "32512": "There is a great improvement here, ma'am?",
  "32513": "Why does he want them?",
  "32514": "Broughton, just get a policeman, will you?",
  "32515": "Would he succeed in coming face to face with the girl he was seeking?",
  "32516": "Whatever do you mean?",
  "32517": "And what went wrong?",
  "32518": "Yes honey, but what's the matter with you, precious?",
  "32519": "Will not the capture of one army after another satisfy him, must all become prisoners?",
  "32520": "How will they get at it?",
  "32521": "Expenses paid, and a moderate screw?",
  "32522": "Was she expecting a visitor?",
  "32523": "Thinks I, what does it mean?",
  "32524": "Were's it gorn?",

  "32537": "Would you go and be dependent on your friends?",
  "32538": "H'm, then you DO give him money?",
  "32539": "Is she, then, preparing for a stroke?",
  "32540": "Where should good news come from to me?",
  "32541": "Well, and what woman don't I should like to know?",
  "32542": "It is midnight?",
  "32543": "Will you have them fetched back?",

  "33067": "Why do you kiss the gentlewoman so?",
  "33068": "Could we sleep under the trees?",
  "33069": "Wentworth?",
  "33070": "And is this all?",
  "33071": "May I ask why?",
  "33072": "Waw didn't you call thief on him, you silly old mucker you?",
  "33073": "Do they never go to sleep?",
  "33074": "Gotta da peach?",
  "33075": "And what was he saying?",
  "33076": "But when were the hopes of humanity fulfilled?",
  "33077": "How did he do?",
  "33078": "What's your lay?",
  "33079": "Who at this court is so audacious as to wish to injure those whom the queen loves?",
  "33080": "Haven't you got any criticism to offer?",
  "33081": "Merciful heavens?",
  "33082": "Have you only just come?",
  "33083": "Over there, do you see, where the pools are?",
  "33084": "Let me ask you why you deceived me?",
  "33085": "Shall you keep it or send it back?",
  "33086": "And now, jown it all, I won't say what I bain't fit for, hey?",
  "33087": "To what do you refer?",
  "33088": "If there be no life in earth, how could life come out of it?",
  "33089": "Is the money, then, ready?",
  "33090": "Can you see them?",
  "33091": "Is there THREE of 'em then?",
  "33092": "Where do we go?",
  "33093": "Would he not one day make you pay for keeping this terrible secret?",
  "33094": "Will there ever be an end to these fooleries?",
  "33095": "But, then, why should he smile so kindly upon you?",
  "33096": "What misfortune?",
  "33097": "How could I wish to make anything hard to you either by my words or conduct?",
  "33098": "What was the meaning of this?",
  "33099": "Would he never come back?",
  "33100": "Are you staying at the flat?",
  "33101": "How could I be expected to know?",
  "33102": "Have you chased them away, too?",
  "33103": "Is he one of your men?",
  "33104": "Everything?",
  "33105": "What have you been doing?",
  "33106": "After all, what could it matter to her whether he were here or there, on this ship or another, ashore or not?",
  "33107": "Are you not near me?",
  "33108": "It is not your business, is it?",
  "33109": "In three days?",
  "33110": "Well then, do you think I am awake?",
  "33111": "Is she ill, or only famished?",
  "33112": "Have you any more notions?",
  "33113": "You are not well?",
  "33114": "Cohan?",
  "33115": "Has he committed a sin?",
  "33116": "Do you want to see it?",
  "33117": "You are still with us, I presume?",
  "33118": "And where is he gone to?",
  "33119": "How d'you do?",
  "33120": "What means had been employed to kidnap this innocent creature, and with what object?",
  "33121": "How can I hope to save her?",
  "33122": "What is't you do?",
  "33123": "What was?",
  "33124": "Well, will you go?",
  "33125": "Do you think I don't know you're always talking about my damned debts and expectations?",
  "33126": "And your grandparents?",
  "33127": "May I request that this table may be cleared?",
  "33128": "What, that child?",
  "33129": "I suppose you would hardly know me again now I've got a pair of whiskers?",
  "33130": "Your wife?",
  "33131": "If he be ever so improper, how can I help his having written to me?",
  "33132": "What jars to our preconceptions will he and I receive here?",
  "33133": "How could there be any good in a woman that everybody spoke ill of?",
  "33134": "What call shall I send?",
  "33135": "How do you name yourself?",
  "33136": "Did you understand that sign?",
  "33137": "Will you come in?",
  "33138": "Cost?",
  "33139": "Why, man, what are you talking about?",
  "33140": "But do you know where?",
  "33141": "How did it happen, citoyen?",
  "33142": "I say, I couldn't have done much better if I had been a young man, could I?",
  "33143": "Was it because she was bareheaded, was it merely her natural expression?",
  "33144": "Have you shadowed her?",
  "33145": "Will you come back?",
  "33146": "And what else can he be after?",
  "33147": "Then how do you come to be going there?",
  "33148": "You mean that the old lady won't leave the money to you?",
  "33149": "Or who, that ever was truly called, believed himself worthy of the summons?",
  "33150": "Well, if war is a terrible thing, what about patriotism, which is the idea at the base of it?",
  "33151": "Does it please your honor that I should accompany you?",
  "33152": "Why, is not here your cloak?",
  "33153": "Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?",
  "33154": "Are all the cranes and pulleys sure?",
  "33155": "She is in prison?",
  "33156": "But there is nothing comforting in having your hair cut off because you've dyed it a dreadful color, is there?",
  "33157": "It is not like her, you say?",
  "33158": "And who is he?",
  "33159": "What's the good of wishing for what you can't get?",
  "33160": "What letter is it?",
  "33161": "And you, what the devil do you want here?",
  "33162": "Suppose we have a little game of euchre?",
  "33163": "What does it all mean?",
  "33164": "But when you leave him, for instance?",
  "33165": "Only slightly touched?",
  "33166": ", and he ran away with her in the boat quite against her will, and what could she do?",
  "33167": "Was it for so petty a thing that he had done all that he had done?",
  "33168": "Perhaps this incident was connected with that of the bullet?",
  "33169": "Conway, what are you going to do?",
  "33170": "Are limes the fashion now?",
  "33171": "It ain't no fun, is it?",
  "33172": "Rebecca, may I give you a wing?",
  "33173": "What were the defects of this remarkable man?",
  "33174": "Won't you tell me a story, while we are resting?",
  "33175": "But how were we to get him into his clothes again?",
  "33176": "I hope I was not the trouble, guardian?",
  "33177": "Where is beauty?",
  "33178": "Where has he gone?",
  "33179": "Well, then, how if we were to begin with oysters, and so change the whole program?",
  "33180": "The face he pulled?",
  "33181": "Can they govern a family, or take care of the poor babes whom they bring into the world?",
  "33182": "Is it, then, stretching our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the occasion of the change?",
  "33183": "Neither gold nor rank?",
  "33184": "But was he alone or accompanied?",
  "33185": "WHY, you dear delightful woman, did you like it?",
  "33186": "Who is knocking?",
  "33187": "That was intended, I think, wasn't it?",
  "33188": "How can you speak of it in that way?",
  "33189": "Do you mean that we are going to die too?",
  "33190": "Why not stay here now and be quiet?",
  "33191": "You have since reflected?",
  "33192": "Do you think your hotel man will open his hotel this month?",
  "33193": "Helen, you wouldn't think I'd invent that?",
  "33194": "Is that all, gentlemen?",
  "33195": "Why should you be inconvenienced?",
  "33196": "Thed what are you?",
  "33197": "Did anyone ever hear the like?",
  "33198": "Is there too much vanity in what I have just said?",
  "33199": "What is that?",
  "33200": "You would not marry him, now that he is free?",
  "33201": "And the unjust is good and wise, and the just is neither?",
  "33202": "Who wrote it?",
  "33203": "Now, was that somebody brother to the prisoner at the bar?",
  "33204": "You don't happen to know why they killed the pig, do you?",
  "33205": "Well, does the colonel treat you well?",
  "33206": "How long are we to endure it?",
  "33207": "What is it that I manage?",
  "33208": "Quite so, but it seems rather an absurd blind, does it not?",
  "33209": "You made paper, pens and ink?",
  "33210": "But why talk now?",
  "33211": "Is he perchance thy son?",
  "33212": "Is it a renewal of the former proposition or what?",
  "33213": "But what to do?",
  "33214": "Shall we charge them or no?",
  "33215": "Why should I tire you with particulars of my consequence?",
  "33216": "Then why do you apply to me?",
  "33217": "If it were alive, wouldn't it trot, and prance, and eat oats?",
  "33218": "And have they appointed the matron?",
  "33219": "And why not?",
  "33220": "Has a girl of fourteen a heart large enough, vigorous enough, to hold the swelling spring of pure, full, fervid eloquence?",
  "33221": "I understand you to say that there are three students who use this stair, and are in the habit of passing your door?",
  "33222": "Our neighbor?",
  "33223": "Where would they meet?",
  "33224": "How was it I noticed nothing?",
  "33225": "Where are you going, bandit?",
  "33226": "You do not doubt his affection?",
  "33227": "What orders?",
  "33228": "Can you walk?",
  "33229": "Even allowing that she does not love him, that she pays no heed to her vows and promises, how can she give herself to another man?",
  "33230": "Who gave her away?",
  "33231": "To what had he brought himself?",
  "33232": "What can be done for it?",
  "33233": "Is everything as it should be?",
  "33234": "I trust he does not suffer?",
  "33235": "How do you mean, the general?",
  "33236": "And how many hours a day did you do lessons?",
  "33237": "Is it a very wicked place?",
  "33238": "You remember well how the mother clamored yesterday for some memento of her daughter, especially her little cap?",
  "33239": "Why had our incomprehensible guide led us to the bottom of this submarine crypt?",
  "33240": "What are you doing tonight?",
  "33241": "Will you take me away with you?",
  "33242": "I hope we are not to part as enemies?",
  "33243": "Ah, dear sister, how can I answer this question?",
  "33244": "Why will you think so?",
  "33245": "What could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as it dropped on her work?",
  "33246": "Do you mean me, sir?",
  "33247": "Did he not pretend to go back to his tribe, who had treated him ill, and driven him from their wigwams like a dog?",
  "33248": "But how can we find the way in this fog?",
  "33249": "Had he noticed that the days had been only six hours long, and that the weight of the atmosphere was so much diminished?",
  "33250": "What was the man doing when you saw him?",
  "33251": "What does all this knowing mean to me?",
  "33252": "Might not that person by patient waiting be covering silent preparation, and proving his fitness for the glorious task before him?",
  "33253": "But what if it's worse than this?",
  "33254": "Not HE?",
  "33255": "Do I try and catch them?",
  "33256": "Still inquisitive?",
  "33257": "Is it my fault if fortune, which has frowned on you, has been kind to me?",
  "33258": "You haf not got something to drink, hey?",
  "33259": "Yes, dear?",
  "33260": "Art shod with lead?",
  "33261": "Wherein have I hurt you?",
  "33262": "He is in, is there another room whence she can hear him?",
  "33263": "Will our help come from you?",
  "33264": "How should there be eighteen copies, all different from the original, and from one another, in minor matters?",
  "33265": "In the meantime, who can foretell what would be the sufferings and privations of the people during its existence?",
  "33266": "Am I cleared?",
  "33267": "What is it, grandmother?",
  "33268": "If we could get a drink?",
  "33269": "Is it not the duty of the nations to combine and to relieve suffering humanity?",
  "33270": "Then that is not the knowledge which we are seeking to discover?",
  "33271": "You met a monk, did you not?",
  "33272": "Can I not read your heart?",
  "33273": "You don't KNOW?",
  "33274": "What, it seems I do not drink but by an attorney?",
  "33275": "What was the cause of this flaw?",
  "33276": "Shall I give her?",
  "33277": "Was it right to be frightened already?",
  "33278": "Why can't they do as I have done, ma'am?",
  "33279": "At what hour would you wish the ceremony performed?",
  "33280": "Do you mean a compliment?",
  "33281": "Do you not know that there is a spirit within you different from flesh?",
  "33282": "In this painful moment can the best of fathers wish to destroy my domestic happiness, the only kind which now remains to me?",
  "33283": "What struggle was going on within him?",
  "33284": "So that he still expects his money?",
  "33285": "Why don't you open the door for papa?",
  "33286": "What will become of us if she dies, as I always fear when her face is like that?",
  "33287": "And if not, is he a devil?",
  "33288": "You your command, and I my title?",
  "33289": "Why has she not written to me, then?",
  "33290": "They are all gone crazy?",
  "33291": "By this train?",
  "33292": "Are they good to eat?",
  "33293": "Will we trample again upon that torn and mangled corpse?",
  "33294": "And who can wonder if it be so, mother?",
  "33295": "Are you comfortable now, sir?",
  "33296": "Swear it was not true?",
  "33297": "What good was moral support in providing a million and a half?",
  "33298": "But can you restore him back to life?",
  "33299": "You won't consider me in your debt?",
  "33300": "I hope you're well?",
  "33301": "Did he designedly conceal some incident of his captivity?",
  "33302": "You remember that young fellow mother wanted me to have?",
  "33303": "So there are fashions, nowadays, in illness, are there?",
  "33304": "Then, sir, you are a favourite, I find, among the ladies?",
  "33305": "Do he rave about his mother just the same, poor fellow?",
  "33306": "Where is it?",
  "33307": "Yours then are rather here?",
  "33308": "Are you in a position to quit the post of superintendent at this moment?",
  "33309": "Do you observe anything remarkable about that?",
  "33310": "How was this to be done?",
  "33311": "Have you never heard talk of a certain secret?",
  "33312": "Have we not myriads of lifelong slaves to vanity among us?",
  "33313": "Did he come here voluntarily?",
  "33314": "Wouldn't you?",
  "33315": "What do you really think of her?",
  "33316": "When did he give it you?",
  "33317": "Unintentionally?",
  "33318": "Harry?",
  "33319": "Am I to come home?",
  "33320": "And the result of the examination?",
  "33321": "His ELDER brother?",
  "33322": "Perhaps he was expected to utter certain words?",
  "33323": "Supposing he is loyal, can any of his requests be granted, and if any, which of them?",
  "33324": "Are you sure you are more reasonable?",
  "33325": "Shall I go in first?",
  "33326": "What will you warm yourself with this winter?",
  "33327": "How is it they come to you?",
  "33328": "What have you got there?",
  "33329": "Have you your carriage?",
  "33330": "Do you think that you will catch anything?",
  "33331": "What is she lying down for?",
  "33332": "Who said she knew him?",
  "33333": "How do you find yourself this morning, sir?",
  "33334": "And what would you call this?",
  "33335": "How think you of that?",
  "33336": "Does she?",
  "33337": "What is that water?",
  "33338": "Going on?",
  "33339": "What palace may it deck?",
  "33340": "Reversed?",
  "33341": "Are you going to sit down, or are you not?",
  "33342": "Oh, master, what are you saying?",
  "33343": "Don't you remember that THAT, originally, was what we were to get her for?",
  "33344": "Were you ever there?",
  "33345": "Ain't you going to do anything, sir?",
  "33346": "Do you see what a villain he is?",
  "33347": "Don't you think a good deal is done when you come out and talk to me this way?",
  "33348": "And yet, when I was at my father's, did not the men give up their gayest balls and parties in order to pass the evening with me?",
  "33349": "But I want to know why the word 'moor' should have been written?",
  "33350": "We sent you wine?",
  "33351": "When did you get the letter?",
  "33352": "What is indispensable to you?",
  "33353": "Or perhaps you are too tired?",
  "33354": "What have I said?",
  "33355": "But how could you be sure I would know it?",
  "33356": "Tell me, I entreat of you, who and what you are?",
  "33357": "Had he not seduced his sisters, one after the other?",
  "33358": "Might I speak to you with regard to that matter of his grace, sir?",
  "33359": "You mean to say our old raft warn't smashed all to flinders?",
  "33360": "Must I close this?",
  "33361": "But what is the black spot, captain?",
  "33362": "The world is surely not worth living in now, is it?",
  "33363": "And was this the man?",
  "33364": "What's the time?",
  "33365": "What's queer?",
  "33366": "But was he a lawyer after all?",
  "33367": "What house will they take?",
  "33368": "Was it well?",
  "33369": "Could it be done?",
  "33370": "Why should I stand in a comrade's way?",
  "33371": "What else should I stay on for?",
  "33372": "What beings surround me?",
  "33373": "What judgment?",
  "33374": "D'Epinay?",
  "33375": "Well, hain't he got a father?",
  "33376": "Are you certain of what you say, monsieur?",
  "33377": "And the reason is that each part of him is doing its own business, whether in ruling or being ruled?",
  "33378": "You want it, I expect?",
  "33379": "Had he been fooled once more?",
  "33380": "Do you seriously believe that that machine has travelled into time?",
  "33381": "Natasha, have you considered what these secret reasons can be?",
  "33382": "What says our graver sister?",
  "33383": "Can I do anything?",
  "33384": "Ain't you seen the rag this week?",
  "33385": "What passage is that?",
  "33386": "But does she now dissolve the union?",
  "33387": "Any way out of that yard, now?",
  "33388": "Waw shouldn't I git a bit o me own back?",
  "33389": "Have those who have had their share in oligarchies been peculiarly wise and peculiarly devoted to the common good?",
  "33390": "What was there to be done in the village?",
  "33391": "What should I tell?",
  "33392": "Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad?",
  "33393": "To what purpose?",
  "33394": "And if it is labor that creates wealth and legitimates property, how explain the consumption of the idler?",
  "33395": "What did you mean by that?",
  "33396": "Well, what do YOU make of it?",
  "33397": "Are there any?",
  "33398": "And if I refuse to retract, you wish to fight, do you?",
  "33399": "Dora, what has happened to you?",
  "33400": "Where have you been sleeping all this week?",
  "33401": "But what do you gather from it?",
  "33402": "Well, ain't you going to save any of it?",
  "33403": "Then how could you know?",
  "33404": "Are you much hurt?",
  "33405": "Daunted?",
  "33406": "And why should you try to deceive me by telling a tale?",
  "33407": "Can I come, with my doll?",
  "33408": "Should not I be able to set it forth correctly before the judge, if occasion required?",
  "33409": "Are you sorry for hiring me, master?",
  "33410": "Yes my boy?",
  "33411": "Why this man saved and that man lost?",
  "33412": "Aren't they beautiful?",
  "33413": "How has my judgment wander'd?",
  "33414": "You know what I mean?",
  "33415": "What, sweetheart?",
  "33416": "What sort of a place is it?",
  "33417": "Well, I vow, that's what the sea folks call sailing UNDER BARE POLES, come true, aint it?",
  "33418": "Who took his hands out of mine?",
  "33419": "I insist upon your living, do you hear?",
  "33420": "Why on earth did you ask him to dine with us?",
  "33421": "A man's or a woman's?",
  "33422": "Was she sheering off?",
  "33423": "What say your old men?",
  "33424": "Monsieur d'Artagnan, will you do me a favor?",
  "33425": "Are not the quail, the pigeon and the partridge the natural prey of the hawk?",
  "33426": "From the country, I see, sir?",
  "33427": "Would prudence or gratitude allow the pontiffs to renounce their benefactor?",
  "33428": "Why must their ruffs be always crinkled like endive leaves, and not crimped with a crimping iron?",
  "33429": "To whom is it they should have recourse?",
  "33430": "But who is there that ever heard of such an instinct?",
  "33431": "Well, but what am I to do?",
  "33432": "Subdivide?",
  "33433": "What is the colour of the men?",
  "33434": "What's the pay?",
  "33435": "Because I sigh when thinking of some one I am leaving?",
  "33436": "Whom did you play with?",
  "33437": "Do they work worse?",
  "33438": "You're not worried about anything?",
  "33439": "Are you sure you know the way?",
  "33440": "Why not make him a doctor like his father?",
  "33441": "But what was that to her, or to any one but myself?",
  "33442": "A little fancy work?",
  "33443": "Where are you off to?",
  "33444": "Yes, but if we can't help them?",
  "33445": "What's set you a snivelling now?",
  "33446": "And who is to do the parish work?",
  "33447": "Are you well fed?",
  "33448": "Well, why don't they support us?",
  "33449": "How many years do you mean to live after I am gone?",
  "33450": "What could these people do?",
  "33451": "Do you think I would leave you?",
  "33452": "And what do you call all this?",
  "33453": "Is it anything bad?",
  "33454": "Is it of course?",
  "33455": "But now what?",
  "33456": "Where did the buffaloes kill him?",
  "33457": "Where is it?",
  "33458": "Would these two travellers make much difference to the horses, if we took them with us?",
  "33459": "Shall we not bear the trials of life a little longer in patience?",
  "33460": "How can they recognize you, if you act in such a manner that no one can recognize you?",
  "33461": "What is it you smell of?",
  "33462": "Forgotten, indeed?",
  "33463": "Were you at the performance last evening?",
  "33464": "How have you got on?",
  "33465": "Why had she allowed him to understand that he was master of her heart?",
  "33466": "Paying the money, I suppose?",
  "33467": "What then should I say, if I dared complain, I who am deprived of all who are dear to me?",
  "33468": "May one venture to ask you, monsieur, on what you have reflected?",
  "33469": "Are you, then, a coward?",
  "33470": "Would it not be safer and more certain if I should ask him his name and tell him yours?",
  "33471": "Why, how did he come here, mother?",
  "33472": "You'll get down, brother, won't you, and take something?",
  "33473": "Why do you say that, when you are going to this terrible war, and he is so old?",
  "33474": "Under what law, and for what offence?",
  "33475": "Easily?",
  "33476": "Why did he not take her in his arms and swear that he would never leave her?",
  "33477": "DID you hear that?",
  "33478": "Is the committee willing to hear this witness?",
  "33479": "Would you care for it?",
  "33480": "Who will be waiting for me beyond the ditch?",
  "33481": "May I?",
  "33482": "What is the stone called?",
  "33483": "Now, sir, tell me who and what that woman was?",
  "33484": "Are you one?",
  "33485": "Married?",
  "33486": "Will that do now?",
  "33487": "How shall I put it on?",
  "33488": "And to what purpose?",
  "33489": "Mouston?",
  "33490": "How is your dear mother getting on?",
  "33491": "But you know how it all ended, don't you?",
  "33492": "Why did we choose it, this foolish task?",
  "33493": "Are you an alienist?",
  "33494": "Cannot ate it?",
  "33495": "You won't give it up?",
  "33496": "You are, I imagine, still of the same opinion?",
  "33497": "When are you going to be sensible, and think of your friends, and try and be a credit to them?",
  "33498": "Or not you so much, perhaps, as your friend in the city?",
  "33499": "Did you ask her how much?",
  "33500": "Is there no force on this side of the creek?",
  "33501": "If I guess rightly, will you confess it?",
  "33502": "Did you ever hear a definition of fame, sir?",
  "33503": "It is to be considered an honour, I suppose?",
  "33504": "Ay, but how shall we know the catchpole?",
  "33505": "What harm is there in that?",
  "33506": "Why are there men and women that while they are nigh me the sunlight expands my blood?",
  "33507": "Why, according to popular belief is it rather characterised by the very contrary?",
  "33508": "Shall we hold it as a province and govern it by despotic power?",
  "33509": "My dear doctor, what is my wife's complaint?",
  "33510": "Do we go all the way today?",
  "33511": "Oh, what does that matter?",
  "33512": "What place was there in her mind for a remonstrance to lodge in?",
  "33513": "Really and truly?",
  "33514": "If that were so, what had become of my father?",
  "33515": "But where is the last year's snow?",
  "33516": "How much will you ask to stay with her till the end?",
  "33517": "What can it be?",
  "33518": "Of whom are you jealous, now?",
  "33519": "What was the sense of that?",
  "33520": "I felt very ignorant, but what could I do?",
  "33521": "And what are you going to do with yourself now, if I may ask?",
  "33522": "What interest of hers was affected by the treaty?",
  "33523": "An order to who?",
  "33524": "Which is the stronger, the small stick that first PRODUCES the fire, or the fire itself?",
  "33525": "So you've been at the club?",
  "33526": "Don't you really?",
  "33527": "Has he been a good soldier except the desertion?",
  "33528": "Do you think not?",
  "33529": "Have you been looking for him, as I ordered?",
  "33530": "O, it an't?",
  "33531": "What you mought call me?",
  "33532": "Full of hope?",
  "33533": "And who will go?",
  "33534": "What is the news, whence is thy embassage?",
  "33535": "Farther?",
  "33536": "Should he slip away after having come and peeped into the barricade?",
  "33537": "Perhaps?",
  "33538": "Very well, my dear sir, and how does that concern us?",
  "33539": "But will the wild ass submit to the bonds?",
  "33540": "Where is the count?",
  "33541": "A whole one, and in a candlestick?",
  "33542": "Are you?",
  "33543": "Are you going to remain as you are, dear princess?",
  "33544": "What might have been your opinion of the place?",
  "33545": "Who defeated it?",
  "33546": "Plantation hand?",
  "33547": "For us, also?",
  "33548": "What is to be done with them?",
  "33549": "What would the life of a man be if he could feel no fear or repulsion?",
  "33550": "Is it really so that I may understand you, sir?",
  "33551": "Well, dad, what do you say about it?",
  "33552": "With what consolations can those, who have thus miscarried in their chief design, elude the memory of their ill success?",
  "33553": "Why did she love everything so tenderly and so passionately, everything living that was not a man?",
  "33554": "In favor of some member of your family?",
  "33555": "You are angry, monsieur?",
  "33556": "What, he told you so, I suppose?",
  "33557": "What, have they buried him in honour for his services to them?",
  "33558": "To stand from fear set free?",
  "33559": "When will they be required, sire?",
  "33560": "You are aware, I suppose, that all mythology and poetry is a narration of events, either past, present, or to come?",
  "33561": "Why do you go, sir?",
  "33562": "You called my father 'Michael' as if you knew him well?",
  "33563": "This DETOUR has been entirely for our benefit, then?",
  "33564": "What do you tell me?",
  "33565": "What was she like now?",
  "33566": "Call the captain, and heave the ship aback?",
  "33567": "And did you observe any change in her then?",
  "33568": "Flee alone, and leave you here?",
  "33569": "Can I have lost it?",
  "33570": "Are the sacrifices I have made of honour and modesty to you no proof of my being tied to you in bonds too strong to be broken?",
  "33571": "But what makes you so much out of sorts?",
  "33572": "Why, wherefore stay you?",
  "33573": "Who asked him while I was away?",
  "33574": "Don't you hear it?",
  "33575": "Jarndyce?",
  "33576": "Why, what's the matter?",
  "33577": "What does it depend upon?",
  "33578": "Now will you learn not to answer back when I speak to you?",
  "33579": "And what you think of it?",
  "33580": "But, on the other hand, did not the people evince decided obstinacy and insubordination?",
  "33581": "And my making it easy for you to see the child?",
  "33582": "Has anyone an interest in preventing your arrival there?",
  "33583": "Do you abuse your teacher?",
  "33584": "Has it struck you that we may not now choose to give over?",
  "33585": "And how do you like the place?",
  "33586": "Why do you not sit by his side and begin talking to him and asking him questions?",
  "33587": "You say papa will get better, and why shouldn't he?",
  "33588": "What have you got to be afraid of?",
  "33589": "What used he to say?",
  "33590": "Where the devil is mine?",
  "33591": "How do you feel yourself?",
  "33592": "That millions of others still exist, which are too minute for any observation?",
  "33593": "I suppose we might call her that?",
  "33594": "Don't you know that it is only very foolish folk who talk sense all the time?",
  "33595": "What's that to me?",
  "33596": "But you are sure you can act your part, and disguise your voice so that he may mistake that, as he has already mistaken your person?",
  "33597": "What would it matter if you smashed to smithereens at the end of the run, after a bust like that?",
  "33598": "Can someone have guessed our secret and dug up the watch?",
  "33599": "But what could he do but just let her see that he would make anything, everything, for her, as honourably easy as possible?",
  "33600": "How many cartridges did you say you had left?",
  "33601": "What then is worth being valued?",
  "33602": "What does this avail?",
  "33603": "This, then, was his father's residence?",
  "33604": "Fisher?",
  "33605": "Ain't there a small drop of something queer about that, eh?",
  "33606": "How like you that answer?",
  "33607": "But what shall we do?",
  "33608": "If it is a friend, why does he not show himself?",
  "33609": "Who then must decide?",
  "33610": "Can we with propriety suffer them to be rulers?",
  "33611": "Have you been here long?",
  "33612": "But why didn't you tell me?",
  "33613": "How can they suit each other?",
  "33614": "Do you see these?",
  "33615": "How do you prove that?",
  "33616": "Arsenic?",
  "33617": "Now, sir, what have you to say to me?",
  "33618": "I suppose we're going to have a talk about this?",
  "33619": "Let 'em both wait?",
  "33620": "Perhaps you would not mind walking to town with me?",
  "33621": "Love had bandaged his eyes, in order to lead him whither?",
  "33622": "It is not my intention to detain the reader by expa?",
  "33623": "Why ask?",
  "33624": "Am I to read this?",
  "33625": "Who are you then?",
  "33626": "What sort of another blackguard are you?",
  "33627": "Was there nothing to fear?",
  "33628": "But did this man hope to conceal himself effectually behind that heap of rubbish, which one need but skirt?",
  "33629": "Then it all depends on that object that you regard, for your reasons, as evidence?",
  "33630": "What if there was no rank of life in which she could now properly attach herself?",
  "33631": "Why then do philosophers look for public spirit?",
  "33632": "How many would he have?",
  "33633": "But do you know this mysterious count is a bachelor?",
  "33634": "Why strive for a coherent, satisfied life?",
  "33635": "You won't throw any more stones, will you?",
  "33636": "Intelligent you call yourselves, do you?",
  "33637": "Did men eat men?",
  "33638": "That is, he was not a boy at all, I suppose?",
  "33639": "I suppose you know he has an order for unlimited credit on the baron's banking establishment?",
  "33640": "Who knew what would have saved him?",
  "33641": "Could he not annul the verdict?",
  "33642": "How can something come out of nothing?",
  "33643": "And now, he said, what did we just now call that principle which repels the even?",
  "33644": "What is that error?",
  "33645": "What is this place?",
  "33646": "Guy, is this amount of confidence to be our stock to start the new life on?",
  "33647": "How is your head, better?",
  "33648": "What matters that?",
  "33649": "The opportunity is a good one, then?",
  "33650": "But if, in spite of all my precautions, I am at last obliged to fight, will you not be my second?",
  "33651": "May I ask you to be so kind as to inquire of all your subjects if any of them have seen a fishing hook lost in the sea?",
  "33652": "And what is your business?",
  "33653": "Had I better wait till it's three o'clock?",
  "33654": "Remember me, don't you?",
  "33655": "Aren't there really?",
  "33656": "Why are you not eating anything, gentlemen?",
  "33657": "But opals are unlucky, aren't they?",
  "33658": "Does this not amount to your stealing the annual salary from your lord?",
  "33659": "Who'd you reckon?",
  "33660": "WILL IT BE COMMUNISM?",
  "33661": "Are you a married man, sir?",
  "33662": "What dream we of?",
  "33663": "What's the good of taking it in hand now?",
  "33664": "But if he does not come?",
  "33665": "Have you any idea what became of them?",
  "33666": "Are you the little girl that comes out with the lady an' four horses?",
  "33667": "And why this ABSOLUTISM in the relations of capitalist and laborer?",
  "33668": "Is any man termed a gentleman, that is not always in the fashion?",
  "33669": "Do I ever leave you?",
  "33670": "Are you all of the same opinion?",
  "33671": "Whose was this mighty personality?",
  "33672": "Perhaps you could name the figures of a few wiolincellers of a good tone?",
  "33673": "Why don't you take it?",
  "33674": "Wenches?",
  "33675": "To marrying whom?",
  "33676": "Am I wrong to come up here to see her?",
  "33677": "You heard my question?",
  "33678": "Why now should I be tempted?",
  "33679": "I'm afraid I've given you a good deal of trouble, haven't I?",
  "33680": "Where's my maid?",
  "33681": "You're able to read?",
  "33682": "What has he lived on since?",
  "33683": "And you resent it?",
  "33684": "Was it not rather a service and a kindly act?",
  "33685": "Won't that do as well?",
  "33686": "Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?",
  "33687": "How could there be when it's barely ten o'clock yet?",
  "33688": "And have you got a paper?",
  "33689": "Where is the girl who promised to marry any one who would release her brother?",
  "33690": "And all arithmetic and calculation have to do with number?",
  "33691": "How do you happen to be here?",
  "33692": "And what is the result?",
  "33693": "Don't you see that all this leads to comfort in the end?",
  "33694": "And for what have you ruined your life, if you come to think of it?",
  "33695": "Who talks of cadeaux?",
  "33696": "But did you not read that I must be alone?",
  "33697": "Do you find the prisoner guilty or not guilty?",
  "33698": "But what's happened to you?",
  "33699": "Are you lost or have the wolves eaten you?",
  "33700": "Yet why do tears blind my eyes?",
  "33701": "Why should I still be subject to these visitations of the devil, when I try so hard to keep him away?",
  "33702": "How do you know what I think?",
  "33703": "But why was the tear in her eye?",
  "33704": "Are you lonesome because you're a magician?",
  "33705": "What had taken place during those ten months?",
  "33706": "You accuse him, then?",
  "33707": "What has anybody to do with that?",
  "33708": "Why has the social instinct, so trustworthy among the animals, erred in the case of man?",
  "33709": "John, which way must we now turn?",
  "33710": "Was I not right?",
  "33711": "Why so breathless a start?",
  "33712": "And have we, at our age, been earnestly discoursing with one another all our life long only to discover that we are no better than children?",
  "33713": "Do you want to go with us?",
  "33714": "Who had taken the letters, if letters there were?",
  "33715": "At any rate, they are all reconciled to it now, I hope?",
  "33716": "And they will place them under the command of experienced veterans who will be their leaders and teachers?",
  "33717": "Even the spiritual vision, is it not at all points arrested by the continuous golden walls of the universe?",
  "33718": "What can you be dreaming of?",
  "33719": "You say again you are quite sure that it was the prisoner?",
  "33720": "Is it any new trouble?",
  "33721": "And talking about the hospital?",
  "33722": "Amid what elegancies of carved furniture, decorated walls, elaborate tapestries did they move?",
  "33723": "If they are really qualified for the task, will not their own hearts be the first to inform them of it?",
  "33724": "What sort of life were that to live?",
  "33725": "What's your trade?",
  "33726": "How could I have been so beguiled?",
  "33727": "How does I talk wild?",
  "33728": "Would we be done for?",
  "33729": "Come, now, my learned friend, what makes you hesitate?",
  "33730": "Why can't you wait?",
  "33731": "You have come far?",
  "33732": "But is she not awfully rich?",
  "33733": "Who can make good coffee?",
  "33734": "So we had better leave you?",
  "33735": "Is the downstairs door fast?",
  "33736": "Or if he is to be governed, how can he be governed well?",
  "33737": "Will you have tea here then, or go across to the house, where there's a tent on the lawn?",
  "33738": "Did you observe the colour?",
  "33739": "Was he a messenger, an omen of the universal dissolution into whiteness and snow?",
  "33740": "Nothing that can't be got over, perhaps, after all?",
  "33741": "Can it be?",
  "33742": "Will this assist in explaining the difficulty?",
  "33743": "Is not my son hungry?",
  "33744": "But you, my dear d'Artagnan, what has happened to you?",
  "33745": "You are sure of your enterprise?",
  "33746": "Have you been at the concert?",
  "33747": "What about her horse?",
  "33748": "Mamma, what am I to say to him?",
  "33749": "When is your turn to come?",
  "33750": "Had I thus come in vain into these forests and mountains?",
  "33751": "Do you call that nothing?",
  "33752": "What is it, then, which does judge about them?",
  "33753": "Shall I lend you a hand here?",
  "33754": "Damn you, what do you mean by that?",
  "33755": "And who's that tall chap standing beside her?",
  "33756": "Would any one deny this?",
  "33757": "And you didn't give him the oysters?",
  "33758": "Did they impose on each industry a proportional tax, so as to preserve a balance in the market?",
  "33759": "What should you do in my place?",
  "33760": "What more could one ask for?",
  "33761": "For who can change men's opinions?",
  "33762": "Have you decided?",
  "33763": "How is your father getting on?",
  "33764": "Were those great, stony cliffs the gates of paradise?",
  "33765": "Shall our rivers and harbors be improved?",
  "33766": "But how do you make it shine through the walls?",
  "33767": "What, do you want to leave us?",
  "33768": "Do you stand me out, mistress?",
  "33769": "If not, why should she not have answered his question?",
  "33770": "How is the poor woman?",
  "33771": "Or, that she should prefer the rant of flattery to the simple accents of sincerity?",
  "33772": "Are you a gentleman?",
  "33773": "How do yer see that?",
  "33774": "Did you speak?",
  "33775": "Shall I see you again before your departure?",
  "33776": "And how are the other people getting on?",
  "33777": "Whah did ye cum from?",
  "33778": "Why should I not go?",
  "33779": "And if they are not fortifying, sire?",
  "33780": "But hark, what music is that?",
  "33781": "What do you suppose they would do to a man disarmed like me?",
  "33782": "Are you really frightened, madame?",
  "33783": "What are you doing, you stupid creature?",
  "33784": "Who will undertake it, if it be not also a service of honour?",
  "33785": "What have you heard?",
  "33786": "But as for me, what solace had I when the days of my fighting were done?",
  "33787": "You were not unfortunate, and yet you are an orphan, fatherless and motherless?",
  "33788": "Would not that have been better evidence?",
  "33789": "Where was my head when I made that grant?",
  "33790": "Wherein, then, lay the resemblance that made the young man's heart beat with a kind of retrospective excitement?",
  "33791": "How will she take it?",
  "33792": "And you order me to announce you to the duchess?",
  "33793": "What more has happened?",
  "33794": "Why did you not tell me, instead of teasing me like this?",
  "33795": "Judah told you?",
  "33796": "So far we are within the bounds of possibility, are we not?",
  "33797": "Will the train soon be in?",
  "33798": "What is your opinion?",
  "33799": "How was it, having so little in reality to conceal, that I always DID feel as if this man were finding me out?",
  "33800": "But isn't there another thing to be done?",
  "33801": "What I wanted, who can say?",
  "33802": "Do you suppose I don't think about that myself?",
  "33803": "Where is thy victory?",
  "33804": "Oh come, now, you don't mean to let on that you LIKE it?",
  "33805": "And pray how do I and these my friends around me seem to you?",
  "33806": "Ah, are you composing poetry, queen?",
  "33807": "What is the use of being exquisite if you are not seen by the best judges?",
  "33808": "Then what was the use of our coming?",
  "33809": "Why do you disappoint me so?",
  "33810": "Are you a child or a teetotum?",
  "33811": "Take head?",
  "33812": "The date?",
  "33813": "Then, when your articled time is over, you'll be a regular lawyer, I suppose?",
  "33814": "Would I do him this favour?",
  "33815": "Do you mind if I go in and tell this man to come on to us when he's finished here?",
  "33816": "Is it in this particular part, or in that other?",
  "33817": "Haven't I seen you blowing as hot as you please?",
  "33818": "Are you ready to get back the trade on those terms?",
  "33819": "To what does your ambition aspire?",
  "33820": "And all complaining, accusing?",
  "33821": "Is she like me?",
  "33822": "What, none of you?",
  "33823": "I am not blushing, for I don't think I need blush about it, need I?",
  "33824": "You will fulfill your promise to me?",
  "33825": "What sort of animal is this interest?",
  "33826": "You must have known that?",
  "33827": "Was it not I?",
  "33828": "And am I dishonest?",
  "33829": "What's the letter?",
  "33830": "Would it please you to accompany her upon the lake?",
  "33831": "Ladies and gentlemen, what is your opinion on the subject?",
  "33832": "What do you want, sir?",
  "33833": "And where can a man seek ends of any sort beyond this broad field?",
  "33834": "How came you to make such a mistake as this?",
  "33835": "Is it too late?",
  "33836": "How do you feel now?",
  "33837": "Anne, did YOU put sugar in these peas?",
  "33838": "That is to say, justice is useful when money is useless?",
  "33839": "Is not this second infinite, so to speak, subjacent to the first?",
  "33840": "And he said nothing as he died?",
  "33841": "WHO forbade you?",
  "33842": "Gallia out of place?",
  "33843": "And am I not ready to do so again?",
  "33844": "Frightened of what?",
  "33845": "Where do we go first?",
  "33846": "Where are you?",

  "34248": "You, gentle brother, forged this for my sake?",
  "34249": "That's all you have come for, is it?",
  "34250": "What's a bar sinister?",
  "34251": "What says it?",
  "34252": "I beg your pardon, sir, but I think those gentlemen are military?",
  "34253": "Should I tell him or should I not tell him?",
  "34254": "And who stands safest?",
  "34255": "And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't see you?",
  "34256": "Lieutenant?",
  "34257": "A sailor, I believe?",
  "34258": "What was the difference between that gallant that's gone and you, sir?",
  "34259": "Are you quite sure of that?",
  "34260": "How can you bear to speak so lightly?",
  "34261": "It is now my turn to ask you 'why?",
  "34262": "Not even got a pencil on you?",
  "34263": "Where, for instance?",
  "34264": "Well, what did he do?",
  "34265": "Why should a man hold a match to the side of his pipe?",
  "34266": "What is it?",
  "34267": "And there it ended?",
  "34268": "Why must I be kept forever muffled up in a scarf and padded boots?",
  "34269": "What in creation made you call him a thief?",
  "34270": "That village a few miles off?",
  "34271": "But why do I not find this rest for this weary heart?",
  "34272": "Why not do something original?",
  "34273": "What are you thinking about?",
  "34274": "How would wild horses drag a secret from a person anyhow?",
  "34275": "But what is the use of it?",
  "34276": "And did he go?",
  "34277": "Is there no way by which I can get it?",
  "34278": "And if any, what?",
  "34279": "Carstone?",
  "34280": "Do you know how to stitch caps?",
  "34281": "And all only for sport?",
  "34282": "Why are we perverse and ask for something else?",
  "34283": "And did he think amiss?",
  "34284": "Is he stupid?",
  "34285": "Was it to end with me?",
  "34286": "For is it more certain, that two flat pieces of marble will unite together, than that two young savages of different sexes will copulate?",
  "34287": "What faculty?",
  "34288": "I hope, prince, that you are too progressive to deny this?",
  "34289": "Oh, shall I then, again become a fatalist, whom fourteen years of despair and ten of hope had rendered a believer in providence?",
  "34290": "Zaccone?",
  "34291": "How do you do again?",
  "34292": "How, quoth the friar, the fit rhyming is upon you too?",
  "34293": "The race?",
  "34294": "What became of you?",
  "34295": "O why?",
  "34296": "Shall we slay him with our pikes?",
  "34297": "A wedding?",
  "34298": "Deserted you?",
  "34299": "Can any here give a name to such a cry?",
  "34300": "What means this outrage?",
  "34301": "Have you been enjoying yourself?",
  "34302": "And nobody called respecting it?",
  "34303": "When one will have defeated the other, of whom can he complain who has the worst of it?",
  "34304": "Then whom, ARE you talking about?",
  "34305": "You mean that this demands explanation, do you not?",
  "34306": "Can it be a song of joy?",
  "34307": "Did it move, did it float on the surface of the ocean, or did it dive into its depths?",
  "34308": "Reasonable well, I give you thanks, wont you alight?",
  "34309": "Do the gentlemen say so?",
  "34310": "Beasts, did you say?",
  "34311": "Who is coming to tea?",
  "34312": "Put an end?",
  "34313": "Won't it strain my joints?",
  "34314": "If it admits it, what kind of predetermined result can that be which a simple resolution, a step, a word, may alter or modify ad infinitum?",
  "34315": "How can I tell him to be sober when I have been a beast all my life?",
  "34316": "Whence comes this fear, that he should shrink from a lonely girl, feeble and timid, simple and mild?",
  "34317": "If free, would he attempt to fly, or would he remain?",
  "34318": "They're not far from here, then?",
  "34319": "Were you a steward or a stoker in those days?",
  "34320": "Is it true that force and right are necessarily on the same side in republican governments?",
  "34321": "Are you aware how small his means are, and of the straitened circumstances of his widow?",
  "34322": "Try some, won't you?",
  "34323": "My own?",
  "34324": "It was to meet him here that you came?",
  "34325": "Had he not cause for triumph?",
  "34326": "Will you hear me?",
  "34327": "Never more to be separated?",
  "34328": "What disguise do you propose to adopt?",
  "34329": "How was that managed?",
  "34330": "Is it not so, my friends?",
  "34331": "And he has accepted the call?",
  "34332": "How long have you been cooling your eye there?",
  "34333": "What name go you by?",
  "34334": "And what truth?",
  "34335": "Yes, where is this letter?",
  "34336": "Where away, cook?",
  "34337": "And with regard to the past?",
  "34338": "A deanery for her brother in the church?",
  "34339": "What shall we have, said he, to drink in these deserts?",
  "34340": "Lady, when was it that your heart was there?",
  "34341": "Where is humanity?",
  "34342": "Where did he live, then?",
  "34343": "What have I done?",
  "34344": "Whom do you wish to speak about?",
  "34345": "You remain near this part?",
  "34346": "Pray what is your own theory as to what took place?",
  "34347": "What?",
  "34348": "She would smile on me, she would say a word to me, would that do any harm to any one?",
  "34349": "How are you, dear child?",
  "34350": "What origin do they attribute to these rifts?",
  "34351": "Do you think I am not grateful?",
  "34352": "WHAT did you see her doing?",
  "34353": "Under these circumstances, was it perfectly certain that no danger could accrue?",
  "34354": "Why should society work out an extraordinary system of rewards for those whom it is already rewarding automatically?",
  "34355": "Don't you think that is an admirable sentiment?",
  "34356": "How could I wait so long?",
  "34357": "Well, have I convinced you?",
  "34358": "Wasn't I right in counting on you?",
  "34359": "Oh, where am I to go?",
  "34360": "You will not let me speak?",
  "34361": "Nothing, I suppose?",
  "34362": "And if they were pleased, would that make them immortal?",
  "34363": "What do they say to this?",
  "34364": "What design has the cardinal upon you to make him so generous?",
  "34365": "Is it indeed so?",
  "34366": "How came you to be walking here?",
  "34367": "There is the other service, the old one, that which belonged to my husband?",
  "34368": "A room just above?",
  "34369": "Will their successors falter and plead organic impotency in the nation?",
  "34370": "Now what do you think?",
  "34371": "It is in my power, think you, to make such a change at demand?",
  "34372": "It will have pity?",
  "34373": "What can I propose?",
  "34374": "Should I not be disingenuously serving my own ends?",
  "34375": "How is bread made?",
  "34376": "Do you recall him?",
  "34377": "You ain't got married?",
  "34378": "Landlords?",
  "34379": "Should they ever again find themselves in the midst of their friends, or seated at the domestic hearth?",
  "34380": "To lead me to my death, is that enough?",
  "34381": "What use am I to make of your instruction?",
  "34382": "Do you think I don't know what's good for you?",
  "34383": "If your crop comes shorter into market than any of theirs, you won't lose your bet, I suppose?",
  "34384": "Where?",
  "34385": "Shall we, then, establish it for a general maxim, that no refined or elaborate reasoning is ever to be received?",
  "34386": "How did you get such big big hips?",
  "34387": "How about me?",
  "34388": "Oh?",
  "34389": "Is it deemed a holy place in the land, then?",
  "34390": "The king has not signed, however?",
  "34391": "Why the delay of a reargument?",
  "34392": "But how do you know?",
  "34393": "Should I ever meet you there?",
  "34394": "But if he did marry her in spite of the threat?",
  "34395": "That's a very old tree over there, isn't it?",
  "34396": "Did I say a peach?",
  "34397": "What has happened since then to give you a completely new idea of the case?",
  "34398": "Has a young man, such as I am, gone through this morning, then?",
  "34399": "Hold on, hold on, won't ye?",
  "34400": "What am I to say, indoors?",
  "34401": "How did he evolve his ethics?",
  "34402": "Have you seen the thief?",
  "34403": "Do virtuous men, in so far as they are virtuous, stand in each other's light?",
  "34404": "Shall we bathe this morning?",
  "34405": "What's the matter now, ma'am?",
  "34406": "And is no allowance to be made for inadvertence, or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment?",
  "34407": "Or is it actual?",
  "34408": "You'll call when you're ready for your pudding, won't you?",
  "34409": "How does she look?",
  "34410": "Married another?",
  "34411": "Do with him?",
  "34412": "And what may his name be, coptain?",
  "34413": "You might have stayed away, I suppose, if you would?",
  "34414": "Brown, convicted of mutinous conduct and sentenced to death?",
  "34415": "Who will become the sharer of this dangerous secret?",
  "34416": "What is the gift of conquest but safety?",
  "34417": "French, eh?",
  "34418": "Is he too so very remarkable?",
  "34419": "Who do you think is going to be married tomorrow?",
  "34420": "Both, on the other hand, had joined pretty gaily in the conversation, for why should they interrupt it?",
  "34421": "I regulate my watch?",
  "34422": "Do you hear, sir?",
  "34423": "How can girls like to have lovers and refuse them?",
  "34424": "Have you finished tea?",
  "34425": "How he out fins and flops about, and blows like a porpoise properly frightened, don't he?",
  "34426": "What like was she?",
  "34427": "Has anything extraordinary happened to you?",
  "34428": "Who made this gruel here?",
  "34429": "And where are they?",
  "34430": "If you had been born such, would you have been here now?",
  "34431": "But how do you come here?",
  "34432": "But I wonder is it so very nice?",
  "34433": "Did it hurt you much?",
  "34434": "Well, well, he made a mistake, didn't he?",
  "34435": "On what principle, then, shall we any longer choose justice rather than the worst injustice?",
  "34436": "Do you reckon YOU can learn 'em anything?",
  "34437": "What do I read here?",
  "34438": "What woman can before her husband?",
  "34439": "Who has the right to dictate to my conscience, and where did he get that right?",
  "34440": "Is she coming, and open, free?",
  "34441": "By your orders?",
  "34442": "To dig the foundations out from under that cabin with?",
  "34443": "Why, you wouldn't break both their hearts now?",
  "34444": "My dear child, how can I help minding?",
  "34445": "Is this so?",
  "34446": "What voice that is nurtured on brandy can ever be clear?",
  "34447": "You'll make up for it by making another?",
  "34448": "Bubbles?",
  "34449": "Are you willing to endure to the last, and not once attempt a repayment?",
  "34450": "What are they, my dear friend?",
  "34451": "What d' you want o' him again?",
  "34452": "I hope you think so?",
  "34453": "But why on earth should it bother him?",
  "34454": "I wonder whether I've done well in advising that amusement?",
  "34455": "Had I?",
  "34456": "Jack?",
  "34457": "What means can I take to introduce it to the world?",
  "34458": "And so it came about that the young rat did see a good deal of the world, but how?",
  "34459": "But they will contest the will after your death?",
  "34460": "Walks by night, does she?",
  "34461": "But there CAN be something else, can't there?",
  "34462": "And who is it to belong to?",
  "34463": "Is that enough?",
  "34464": "What about souls?",
  "34465": "But what have you been doing?",
  "34466": "Do we need common sense and fairness in our regulations?",
  "34467": "Have you let your lodgings, ma'am?",
  "34468": "Ought we to rank this one species with bears, and what should we do with the other species?",
  "34469": "Were you not engaged in it then?",
  "34470": "How do you know that, sir?",
  "34471": "Fond mother, whence these fears?",
  "34472": "As 'what has occurred that has never occurred before?",
  "34473": "Is it conscious?",
  "34474": "What do you know on the subject?",
  "34475": "And what, pray, is your idea of the duties of a devoted friend?",
  "34476": "Who can desire it more than I?",
  "34477": "What would you propose doing?",
  "34478": "What chance have I?",
  "34479": "What were his charms?",
  "34480": "Why should they not work for a uniform minimum of labour conditions through all their communities?",
  "34481": "So he has turned you out?",
  "34482": "Come for long?",
  "34483": "By the way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from?",
  "34484": "Why should he be so mean now?",
  "34485": "After all, I don't funk it, do I?",
  "34486": "Hadn't we better stroll into the park?",
  "34487": "Did ye not care for her?",
  "34488": "DO with it?",
  "34489": "Ask you what provocation I have had?",
  "34490": "Not know the thing which my own eyes beheld?",
  "34491": "Anything else?",
  "34492": "Will you taste for yourself?",
  "34493": "It's not a very nice night to be out, is it?",
  "34494": "You'll come and meet me as usual, girls?",
  "34495": "Now, had I come upon a hopeless incompatibility?",
  "34496": "Do you know what you're doing?",
  "34497": "Quite a vineyard, hey?",
  "34498": "Do I flatter myself if I allow myself to look at it in that way?",
  "34499": "Have I done right?",
  "34500": "He's all right?",
  "34501": "How can I ever thank you for all the deep obligations you impose upon me every day?",
  "34502": "Was there no loophole of escape?",
  "34503": "I suppose we must take the shapes of beasts?",
  "34504": "What are you surprised at?",
  "34505": "What did they matter when he played divinely?",
  "34506": "Tell me the why of this?",
  "34507": "But is it that makes you go?",
  "34508": "On what plausible ground can it be maintained that a physician should be paid two, three, or a hundred times as much as a peasant?",
  "34509": "Will you graciously let me kiss your hand?",
  "34510": "Who are you to ask me my business?",
  "34511": "But does not this question make a disturbance outside of political circles?",
  "34512": "What influence can I possibly have over a bandit?",
  "34513": "Why don't you make him speak?",
  "34514": "Is there a carriage at the door?",
  "34515": "Do you still wish to do so?",
  "34516": "At all events, what use was there in delaying?",
  "34517": "And what right had she to be cross?",
  "34518": "What's the good, if you're sick with love for him?",
  "34519": "How should you?",
  "34520": "Is that fine, keen edge upon your soul that gives such avidity for holy things?",
  "34521": "What of the resemblance?",
  "34522": "Why a locksmiths' association in a village?",
  "34523": "Or must I fly the country altogether?",
  "34524": "You play cards, don't you?",
  "34525": "What would have been the result?",
  "34526": "Back at last?",
  "34527": "What else could this fragment be but the sole surviving remnant of some sumptuous mansion that once had stood on this unrivaled site?",
  "34528": "Isn't it possible to help them?",
  "34529": "Did you notice how he answered to it?",
  "34530": "In relation to what objects?",
  "34531": "Are these powers conferred on you by the state legislature or by some higher authority?",
  "34532": "You WERE afraid?",
  "34533": "Do you think I am deceiving you?",
  "34534": "How can you know what he is?",
  "34535": "What were you eating there all by yourself for your dinner?",
  "34536": "What'll yer give me?",
  "34537": "Are you going to sail in?",
  "34538": "Wonder if you'll ever drag me up there?",
  "34539": "Is there any need to hurry, sir?",
  "34540": "Still I ask you, what is this to me?",
  "34541": "And leave the litter as it is?",
  "34542": "Do you advance with him?",
  "34543": "So perhaps I shall rub on?",
  "34544": "In front or behind?",
  "34545": "And by what authority?",
  "34546": "Yea, what then?",
  "34547": "I really could not say?",
  "34548": "And does he imagine that the coadjutor will put himself out for him?",
  "34549": "Do you think she will ever forget that her son is her safeguard, her shield, the pledge for her dignity, for her fortune and her life?",
  "34550": "You said prince, did you not?",
  "34551": "Are you sure they won't come and search the garret?",
  "34552": "Was it worth it?",
  "34553": "What young ladies?",
  "34554": "Shall we turn back?",
  "34555": "At the end of your name stands for?",
  "34556": "Is it not time to decide finally the meaning of the gift of the great fortune now all in your hand, and growing?",
  "34557": "Well, are we going to stand here all day?",
  "34558": "Have we reached the limits of what reason can supply?",
  "34559": "What should I say?",
  "34560": "What will gladden your heart?",
  "34561": "Are you sure it will be the last time?",
  "34562": "She'll do, won't she?",
  "34563": "What is that for a man to do?",
  "34564": "Since when?",
  "34565": "Why, soldiers, why?",
  "34566": "How came you to read some of those queerer ones?",
  "34567": "Did you not love your husband either?",
  "34568": "Where is true peace or true glory?",
  "34569": "How is it now?",
  "34570": "Durys?",
  "34571": "Don't you want to stop any longer?",
  "34572": "Has the reality of them ever been perceived by you through the bodily organs?",
  "34573": "Which girls should love?",
  "34574": "When was it?",
  "34575": "Does it belong to anybody in the neighbourhood?",
  "34576": "The person to whom I addressed my scruples asked me where your father had acquired his property?",
  "34577": "Has anything happened?",
  "34578": "Did you hit her?",
  "34579": "Is there any signal for the general rally?",
  "34580": "About what age is he?",
  "34581": "And why did I come here?",
  "34582": "What mercy can you expect from the man whom you have wronged?",
  "34583": "Have I taken an oath of some sort, then?",
  "34584": "Shall we say, in such a case, that the will of the majority was for the ultimate end?",
  "34585": "Where what?",
  "34586": "You say?",
  "34587": "Do you no longer like to think of your mother?",
  "34588": "What are you doing?",
  "34589": "May I understand, sir, that you threat is withdrawn, and that my income is secure?",
  "34590": "Are the two so deeply separated in this town, that there is no place whatever for an honest workman between them?",
  "34591": "Why then should a man cling to a longer stay here?",
  "34592": "The symptoms are marked, do you see?",
  "34593": "Who captured you?",
  "34594": "But supposing we had the authority, I would ask what good can result from the examination?",
  "34595": "What am I coming for?",
  "34596": "But settled?",
  "34597": "Did I like his voice?",
  "34598": "How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor?",
  "34599": "Who to?",
  "34600": "And the girl?",
  "34601": "Well, have you had a good hunt, have you botanised successfully?",
  "34602": "And why should you want to spite her?",
  "34603": "What did you pick me up for?",
  "34604": "And what does 'in my name' mean?",
  "34605": "What, are you all got together, like players at the end of the last act?",
  "34606": "Have you ever seen it?",
  "34607": "Isn't it the truth?",
  "34608": "When, then, did father and son exchange shields, and why?",
  "34609": "Would he have been justified in sacrificing his own child, even if he could thereby save another's?",
  "34610": "Why are you only laying one place?",
  "34611": "Loves him?",
  "34612": "Yet who are the folk whom you find HERE?",
  "34613": "Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?",
  "34614": "Who is coming in here?",
  "34615": "What was she going to say, and what reply would she get?",
  "34616": "Can you tell me how to go about getting on the stage?",
  "34617": "What was your idea, then?",
  "34618": "Running from what?",
  "34619": "Valdemar?",
  "34620": "How are you going to manage to get out?",
  "34621": "Have you a portmanteau?",
  "34622": "What does it matter?",
  "34623": "What depth have we now reached?",
  "34624": "For my sake you are prepared to do this terrible thing?",
  "34625": "Wouldn't you have been rude?",
  "34626": "What the deuse do we men go to school for?",
  "34627": "If it be called swamp or sky?",
  "34628": "Defend ourselves against D'Artagnan?",
  "34629": "How the devil is he so like?",
  "34630": "Once more, will you undertake it?",
  "34631": "Are not these functions proper to the soul, and can they rightly be assigned to any other?",
  "34632": "Was it sheer blind force of passion that would satisfy her now?",
  "34633": "How's this, dear niece?",
  "34634": "Do you know who that was?",
  "34635": "Was SHE at the ball too?",
  "34636": "And what made you ask it of me?",
  "34637": "Do you know that if we should ship, it would serve you quite right?",
  "34638": "Where are your wits?",
  "34639": "Is it possible, dear, that what I hear is true?",
  "34640": "No clue?",
  "34641": "Will you give me as far from the river as you can distinguish the belly of a horse?",
  "34642": "So what if he died, how did this concern the boy?",

  "36234": "What should I do?",
  "36235": "Is that all?",
  "36236": "Who, sire?",
  "36237": "I think I am a philosopher, perhaps, and who knows, perhaps I do wish to teach my views of things to those I meet with?",
  "36238": "Do I seem one to fear for myself?",
  "36239": "But suppose you've bitten a specky bit by accident?",
  "36240": "But where do they sleep?",
  "36241": "You have seen him, then?",
  "36242": "But, just what did the genewal tell you?",
  "36243": "There's nothing to keep you, is there?",
  "36244": "Nicholas, when when did you break your cameo?",
  "36245": "D'you remember the last time we met?",
  "36246": "What hope could there have been for him then?",
  "36247": "You have no mother?",
  "36248": "Outside of a private car?",
  "36249": "How is she ever to do better?",
  "36250": "You had heard that there was an execution in the house?",
  "36251": "Can you see where he has put his rifle or his bow?",
  "36252": "But who the deuce is he following?",
  "36253": "Are not necessary pleasures those of which we cannot get rid, and of which the satisfaction is a benefit to us?",
  "36254": "Can they understand or explain even their own characters?",
  "36255": "And why so?",
  "36256": "Is he a good doctor, my love?",
  "36257": "And where is your lodging?",
  "36258": "You won't be quite at the other end of the world, will you?",
  "36259": "I hope, my dear friend, you will carry out your father's wish?",
  "36260": "You have knocked at all doors?",
  "36261": "Wouldn't it give a mighty big bump to her subconscious self, or whatever the jargon is, and start it functioning again right away?",
  "36262": "Old man, how goes?",
  "36263": "But what could he have to do with this old family custom of ours, and what does this rigmarole mean?",
  "36264": "Had his hurt declared itself to be a mortal one?",
  "36265": "Will you take my arm, sir?",
  "36266": "Is it in my character?",
  "36267": "Uncle, what wood is this?",
  "36268": "Well, what did he say then?",
  "36269": "There they were, the words, and what did she want more?",
  "36270": "What does he desire of me?",
  "36271": "Are you like all the rest?",
  "36272": "How dare you grin at me like that?",
  "36273": "Who will make me that summons?",
  "36274": "Especially with copper toes?",
  "36275": "Was it the effect of the lunar rays?",
  "36276": "What have you said?",
  "36277": "You never find he slights his work when your back is turned?",
  "36278": "Perhaps you would like to pay interest?",
  "36279": "Which is she?",
  "36280": "Is that any reason why we should propose to preserve it for ever in a condition of tutelage?",
  "36281": "And my walking up and down for three hours from the table to the stove?",
  "36282": "Not chops?",
  "36283": "Isn't she a clever thing?",
  "36284": "Would he choose the peers, for example?",
  "36285": "Why, how are you?",
  "36286": "Who persuaded them into letting him see if he could drive?",
  "36287": "Do you think you can behead me with a single blow?",
  "36288": "For whence does everything come?",
  "36289": "Where is the letter?",
  "36290": "Poor old who?",
  "36291": "And this stutterer, won't he turn out a murderer?",
  "36292": "Me?",
  "36293": "Do you know this person?",
  "36294": "But you didn't have much to do with him, did you?",
  "36295": "What WILL he do, then?",
  "36296": "Where do you expect to get to?",
  "36297": "Your birthday?",
  "36298": "What have your family got to do with it?",
  "36299": "How much do I get?",
  "36300": "But may he not change and transform himself?",
  "36301": "It is not so?",
  "36302": "Then I shall really have them?",
  "36303": "So you go back from your promise?",
  "36304": "May she?",
  "36305": "Do you remember what I said when you asked me what I should do if I won all the pots I set my heart on and came through alive?",
  "36306": "Is it too great?",
  "36307": "At it again, hey?",
  "36308": "Which was it?",
  "36309": "Then why don't you send this new cove?",
  "36310": "Do you believe in presentiments and superstitions?",
  "36311": "Are you now satisfied?",
  "36312": "Your success too?",
  "36313": "What, then, are we to conclude in regard to the many fishes, both sexes of which are splendidly coloured?",
  "36314": "The bandits whom the abbe keeps in pay and drink have their useful side, have they?",
  "36315": "Can a man who listens to these three counsellors be sure that he is right in a given decision?",
  "36316": "Have we not perfectly understood each other?",
  "36317": "There is a good postal service, I suppose?",
  "36318": "Comes it in there?",
  "36319": "Tell us now, at once, what you made of the present?",
  "36320": "Do you want to be killed?",
  "36321": "What is popular sovereignty?",
  "36322": "Do you think we are sure to come out of the wilderness?",
  "36323": "How hang your pouches?",
  "36324": "Should you like to be her boatman?",
  "36325": "How did I survive and surmount such wounds?",
  "36326": "How often we sin, how much we deceive, and all for what?",
  "36327": "Will soon what?",
  "36328": "Know you anything of your own family at that time?",
  "36329": "And from a noble client?",
  "36330": "So that, in fact, you have never learned or heard anything in particular?",
  "36331": "Marquise, whence do you come?",
  "36332": "What was said or done?",
  "36333": "And where will your worship drink?",
  "36334": "How is it that you have no friends in your prosperity when you had many in adversity?",
  "36335": "King's attorney?",
  "36336": "What could they think indeed?",
  "36337": "HERE?",
  "36338": "If he were in love with the lady?",
  "36339": "Why does she come so close?",
  "36340": "And will he be the better for that?",
  "36341": "What's the matter with your nose, there?",
  "36342": "Now I ax what have they to show for their three months' setting?",
  "36343": "Cherries?",
  "36344": "How are we to know them if we do find them?",
  "36345": "What about the other girl, the one you decoyed away over a week ago?",
  "36346": "How could she not be happy?",
  "36347": "It has been a delightful evening, has it not?",
  "36348": "And now, doctor, what are we to do about money?",
  "36349": "Had they not searched exactly where the document stated?",
  "36350": "How you like it, hey, ole sport?",
  "36351": "But what human language can adequately portray that astonishment, that horror which possessed me at the spectacle then presented to view?",
  "36352": "How came the woman's ring there?",
  "36353": "At best, might not a man in the water lose all his power of direction, and so move in an endless circle until he sank exhausted?",
  "36354": "Does his wife know of it?",
  "36355": "And what is the solar heat?",
  "36356": "If any one were to come in, my dear boy?",
  "36357": "Has your grace taken the precaution to come out in a good stout pair of boots?",
  "36358": "Whet, whoiver knew yah wur coming?",
  "36359": "Where would you wish to go?",
  "36360": "What tidings of the foe?",
  "36361": "Why do I think of her as dressed in green?",
  "36362": "Was that all a human being amounted to?",
  "36363": "But you would not advise me to refuse?",
  "36364": "And so much to my honour too?",
  "36365": "And why look there?",
  "36366": "And have you no mind of my weight of passion, and the holy dispensation, and the drift of heifers I am giving, and the golden ring?",
  "36367": "Did you know her?",
  "36368": "And do you not know, I said, that all mere opinions are bad, and the best of them blind?",
  "36369": "But you're not going away?",
  "36370": "I forgive you?",
  "36371": "What do I care?",
  "36372": "I say, you are not jealous, are you?",
  "36373": "How long will a few hundred pounds last such a chap as that?",
  "36374": "Where is he wounded?",
  "36375": "But what is to be the object of this capricious partiality in the national councils?",
  "36376": "The one in the dark blue coat?",
  "36377": "Want any?",
  "36378": "But why?",
  "36379": "If you come to that, it's hardly my place to be flung out of the flat like this and have to go to an hotel, what?",
  "36380": "Will you open, yes or no?",
  "36381": "Isn't that it?",
  "36382": "If so, on what does your constitution rest?",
  "36383": "With whom?",
  "36384": "What were you doing up there?",
  "36385": "Can you have forgotten your oath?",
  "36386": "What convicts?",
  "36387": "What are we waiting for now?",
  "36388": "And how much is the tax?",
  "36389": "Now, what did you gather from that woman's appearance?",
  "36390": "Why is it you can do nothing?",
  "36391": "Do you want to know if I am telling the truth?",
  "36392": "What a state of society is this for a free country?",
  "36393": "But won't this density augment?",
  "36394": "Was it in the afternoon?",
  "36395": "Do you want me to explain what that is?",
  "36396": "A stealthy footstep on the stairs?",
  "36397": "Is this a fairy country?",
  "36398": "Is it a thing, or is it a name, or is it a fraud?",
  "36399": "Can you come with me?",
  "36400": "Did you see by the paper they are going to call out the militia?",
  "36401": "Do the footmen kiss her?",
  "36402": "But why does she lie on a sofa?",
  "36403": "And you understand that language, don't you?",
  "36404": "What answer was sent?",
  "36405": "What, billing, exchanging stolen glances and broken murmurs?",
  "36406": "But what's this?",
  "36407": "What vapour is that?",
  "36408": "Look at that medder, beant it lovely?",
  "36409": "Who would undertake to feed such an enormous multitude?",
  "36410": "By the way, would you mind lending me your matches?",
  "36411": "How could she, a woman, not yet bereft of youth or charms, live alone in the forest, among a troop of soldiers?",
  "36412": "Could he expect that her friends would not step forward?",
  "36413": "Where's my cousin?",
  "36414": "What's the price?",
  "36415": "Fur lined?",
  "36416": "What are they to do?",
  "36417": "Why, how can it be just to beat a father?",
  "36418": "What, are you crossing of yourself?",
  "36419": "You now understand the place, don't you?",
  "36420": "But are you not afraid to leave the horse in his power now, since he has every interest in injuring it?",
  "36421": "Why did you come, then?",
  "36422": "What was the abbe's name?",
  "36423": "Never see you again?",
  "36424": "Would the lock click at the end of those seemingly interminable intervals of time?",
  "36425": "Comes he not?",
  "36426": "Why am I left here alone?",
  "36427": "Do you mean to say you think we are going to have bad weather?",
  "36428": "Then you didn't see the cobs?",
  "36429": "Why were these prisoners not disarmed?",
  "36430": "Why is there this difference?",
  "36431": "Blacksmith, eh?",
  "36432": "You must surely also have been married?",
  "36433": "Why did not he attack at once?",
  "36434": "Were the shutters closed?",
  "36435": "Camels?",
  "36436": "What are you afraid of, prince?",
  "36437": "What more COULD it be?",
  "36438": "Doesn't tha' know?",
  "36439": "Carmarthen?",
  "36440": "Cannot we do anything to put an end to it?",
  "36441": "Do you find me of sufficient rank to do me the honor of crossing swords with me?",
  "36442": "And what shall I say of his virtues?",
  "36443": "What can you expect?",
  "36444": "Are you a patriot?",
  "36445": "'Tis so well known here, is it, comrade?",
  "36446": "Why don't you show us your foot quietly?",
  "36447": "Whom do you speak of?",
  "36448": "You will write to her in a day or two?",
  "36449": "Ha, lady?",
  "36450": "Do you want to be let in?",
  "36451": "Was it her character, or her mind, or her nature?",
  "36452": "What is the matter, love?",
  "36453": "What could he be looking for on that immense expanse?",
  "36454": "And how the deuce could I, even if I knew every girl in the place?",
  "36455": "But would she pass on, or would she put into port?",
  "36456": "You looked into the cellars?",
  "36457": "How could you be so rude, so mean, and cruel to us both?",
  "36458": "Was not the selection of the male guardians determined by differences of this sort?",
  "36459": "Why, who do you think this is?",
  "36460": "Is that his design in settling here?",
  "36461": "You teach in it yourself?",
  "36462": "But how did it originate?",
  "36463": "What in the world, between them, ever took place?",
  "36464": "Where does the needle and thread come from?",
  "36465": "But what was that?",
  "36466": "Do you not think that, in putting it as you have done, you have been unjust?",
  "36467": "Do you wish to assassinate a man who, in the eyes of heaven, is a brother?",
  "36468": "Did she know where her husband was?",
  "36469": "Then you'll go?",
  "36470": "Under the bed, are you, hussy?",
  "36471": "Have no society, no neighbors?",
  "36472": "And if I do my duty and do right, you will sustain me, will you not?",
  "36473": "Perhaps he condoles with me, does he?",
  "36474": "Who are these builded for, my son?",
  "36475": "Affords this art no greater miracle?",
  "36476": "Well, then, what do you propose to do?",
  "36477": "You saw the lady fall?",
  "36478": "Do you think as it could be a rabbit?",
  "36479": "But how did you get to work again?",
  "36480": "Would it not, moreover, be much more easy for him to gain his daughter, if he did all in his power to forward his father's views?",
  "36481": "What man could be more lovable than such a man as would grow from such a boy?",
  "36482": "Why should not we also enjoy an original relation to the universe?",
  "36483": "Are you thinking I'm safe?",
  "36484": "Well, what of it?",
  "36485": "What's he up to now, I wonder?",
  "36486": "What do you keep on doing it for?",
  "36487": "Did you receive the despatch?",
  "36488": "He is living?",
  "36489": "Shall I really tell you?",
  "36490": "What will our friends think of us, who may chance to be upon the street and witness our frivolous antics?",
  "36491": "Or a subjugator?",
  "36492": "How long have you been married?",
  "36493": "Yet who is there does not sometimes hazard it for the enjoyment of an hour?",
  "36494": "Now for what, my dear friend?",
  "36495": "You will promise me that, at any rate?",
  "36496": "What was their languid grace but the softness of chambering?",
  "36497": "Will it not be better to wait until we have explored it to its mouth?",
  "36498": "Could I count them on my fingers?",
  "36499": "May I come in?",
  "36500": "'Twould mean that I agree, wouldn't it?",
  "36501": "Don't you think it's pleasanter out in the veranda?",
  "36502": "Are you for the rich or for the poor?",
  "36503": "Whose is he?",
  "36504": "Who has been telling you about him?",
  "36505": "Have you nothing else to tell him?",
  "36506": "Worse?",
  "36507": "What would the best of us be if he were suddenly placed at war with the whole world?",
  "36508": "Who is your man?",
  "36509": "Where is he now?",
  "36510": "What are you bothering for?",
  "36511": "Do you seek any guidance from me?",
  "36512": "How on earth should she talk of any one else as long as you are here?",
  "36513": "And a narrative it remains both in the speeches which the poet recites from time to time and in the intermediate passages?",
  "36514": "And others say even that the external world is the work of our organs?",
  "36515": "Am I sorry?",
  "36516": "And, indeed, unless this shoal had a machine in its stomach, how could it change its position with such astonishing rapidity?",
  "36517": "Could the prisoners see each other?",
  "36518": "But why do you ask?",
  "36519": "Ar'n't you coming with me, dearest?",
  "36520": "Are you quite sure, then, that you WILL come to see him often?",
  "36521": "Till then, will you be one, sir?",
  "36522": "And will you undertake to deliver it?",
  "36523": "Well, did you like it?",
  "36524": "Where is my aunt?",
  "36525": "You are horrified?",
  "36526": "Who can say where the dominion of mind over matter ceases?",
  "36527": "But if you think all servitude intolerable, to what purpose serve your complaint against your particular governors?",
  "36528": "If he were so delighted by my visit, why had he not crossed the lawn at once as soon as he saw the car?",
  "36529": "Then men who are injured are of necessity made unjust?",
  "36530": "What odds then?",
  "36531": "I said so, didn't I?",
  "36532": "And an ugly customer too, wasn't he?",
  "36533": "I don't go much on those things, do you?",
  "36534": "But what shall it be?",
  "36535": "What do you think of that for a kite?",
  "36536": "But it's all over now, isn't it?",
  "36537": "Oh, it comes out, then, in the photograph?",
  "36538": "Who denies it?",
  "36539": "And hasn't the messenger come back?",
  "36540": "Think ye to be eaten by him?",
  "36541": "Will you give me some money?",
  "36542": "And what occurred then?",
  "36543": "Do you love me so much, then?",
  "36544": "Were you there?",
  "36545": "Why so dull and mute, young sinner?",
  "36546": "But he paid your ransom?",
  "36547": "And how is your sister?",
  "36548": "Whear the divil?",
  "36549": "When you shall have taken this money back to your prince, what advice will you give him?",
  "36550": "Is that the way you talk?",
  "36551": "Where the baker who, retiring from business, leaves his customers and his establishment to his assistants?",
  "36552": "Well what is WHOM?",
  "36553": "No bad?",
  "36554": "How can they be helped, mama?",
  "36555": "And is not their humanity to the condemned in some cases quite charming?",
  "36556": "Is it not because they have not enough at home wherewith to fill their bellies and their pokes?",
  "36557": "You suppose they really TALK of them?",
  "36558": "Don't you see anything?",
  "36559": "Do you know, my husband, why I came here?",
  "36560": "What, was it conscience then?",
  "36561": "Why has fate given you two such splendid children?",
  "36562": "It is a good sight to see, I suppose?",
  "36563": "Salted them on me?",
  "36564": "What are you by trade?",
  "36565": "Now, are you ready?",
  "36566": "I wanted to know if, loving her and wishing her happiness, you would consider it good for her to marry me?",
  "36567": "Where are you bound?",
  "36568": "Has he been moved?",
  "36569": "Or shall we not establish our equality in this manner?",
  "36570": "Why had he come to this house?",
  "36571": "What are you going on in this way at me for?",
  "36572": "And if that is true, what sort of general must he have been?",
  "36573": "What's the case now?",
  "36574": "Why may I not rest me from this restlessness and sleep from this wide waking?",
  "36575": "And do you know this gentleman, monsieur?",
  "36576": "Presently?",
  "36577": "Then I have been your property, have I?",
  "36578": "Is that really the case?",
  "36579": "Are the passes open?",
  "36580": "To go to the bottom?",
  "36581": "If you are going into the operations of commerce who will look after the government?",
  "36582": "Why shouldn't you be serious?",
  "36583": "What strength had I to dart retaliation at my antagonist?",
  "36584": "Have you seen him?",
  "36585": "And why should we have done it?",
  "36586": "Do you hear that flourish of trumpets?",
  "36587": "How long shall I be your victim?",
  "36588": "What on earth put that into her head?",
  "36589": "And when shall you come back again?",
  "36590": "You say the affair was decisive?",
  "36591": "And what do you mean by saying I ain't any better off than you are?",
  "36592": "And how did he make his money?",
  "36593": "Mamma?",
  "36594": "Then, why don't you extend your liberality to others?",
  "36595": "What do you expect me to do?",
  "36596": "Who do you suppose, my dear?",
  "36597": "About my what?",
  "36598": "Didn't he speak of me in any way?",
  "36599": "So you understand the whole position of our troops?",
  "36600": "How want of love tormenteth?",
  "36601": "You know how ignorant I am, and that I only ask for information, but isn't it always so?",
  "36602": "What became of this little boy?",
  "36603": "Torpenhow?",
  "36604": "Why, please your ladyship, said her kinsman, what signifies all you say?",
  "36605": "?",
  "36606": "Are you going to sit snoring there, all day?",
  "36607": "You know this chief, then?",
  "36608": "Does he mean that?",
  "36609": "But what do we do?",
  "36610": "You have no doubt of their reality?",
  "36611": "Is my father here?",
  "36612": "On credit?",
  "36613": "You still bear in mind what it means?",
  "36614": "And there you sit, I suppose, all the day long, eh?",
  "36615": "Why, as to improvements, magnify the evil, and stoutly refuse to see any good in them?",
  "36616": "From the earth, in the sky?",
  "36617": "If you shall be a cuckold?",
  "36618": "And the unjust man will strive and struggle to obtain more than the unjust man or action, in order that he may have more than all?",
  "36619": "Why did not you kick him out, and let her in, and say I'll be an honest wife and a noble woman from this hour?",
  "36620": "What, all five out at once?",
  "36621": "Do you think that there is anything so very unnatural or inexcusable in their case?",

  "36630": "Could you decide now?",
  "36631": "Haven't I told you that?",
  "36632": "Made to be amused only?",
  "36633": "And what other wretchedness would come to him?",
  "36634": "You have never heard of papa, I suppose?",

  "36637": "Now what horrible thing can have happened?",
  "36638": "What has he heard?",
  "36639": "We are both undone, and what better are we for our being reconciled together, seeing we have nothing to live on?",
  "36640": "Great old boy, isn't he?",
  "36641": "Should he sacrifice more men, with so few chances of saving those already sacrificed?",
  "36642": "Have you not yourself already had the same fear?",
  "36643": "Have the men taken cover?",
  "36644": "Are you not insulting me with some unworthy joke?",

  "36646": "Isn't it delightful to live here?",
  "36647": "Are they all brothers, sir?",
  "36648": "Should he find an issue?",
  "36649": "What's the use of our trying to do anything, trying to know anything, trying to be anything?",
  "36650": "What could be better than to combine these accounts, and make up a complete narrative from them all?",
  "36651": "You pledge yourself to that, marshal?",

  "36689": "Was that a command to him to go?",
  "36690": "Why don't you come with us?",
  "36691": "What should social, intelligent, and free beings have learned from this uncertainty of value?",
  "36692": "What has that got to do with it?",
  "36693": "Is that so much amiss?",
  "36694": "You adhere to that resolution?",
  "36695": "Did you ever hear any woman speak like her?",
  "36696": "Would your honor let me make another turning?",
  "36697": "Do you keep plate in the house, or anything to attract burglars?",
  "36698": "Can we repair the injuries which it may have done to individuals?",
  "36699": "And is this all?",
  "36700": "What do you ask?",
  "36701": "What are you thinking?",
  "36702": "Hand, gait, face, changed?",
  "36703": "How does that follow?",
  "36704": "To the uttermost regions of the globe have not the indignant winds bruited its unparalleled infamy?",
  "36705": "Did he wear a light wideawake?",
  "36706": "How long has he been painting?",

  "36721": "What use do you make of these men?",
  "36722": "After all, who would have looked for such bitter satire from a creature so young, and so exquisitely beautiful?",
  "36723": "But if we cannot live here any longer, father?",
  "36724": "Who could tell you that?",
  "36725": "But why not?",
  "36726": "Could the hope of being king do it?",

  "36730": "You laugh, child?",
  "36731": "Tell me then, what part of the world is it that you will sacrifice for my charms?",
  "36732": "But must we go through them?",
  "36733": "The reason for that?",

  "36743": "Are you sure that we are not its objects?",
  "36744": "But this rascal?",
  "36745": "And you will protect us, who are your children, against the will of my father?",
  "36746": "That was encouraging, you know?",
  "36747": "You will help me to see him if you can?",
  "36748": "You do a good deal of business here, I suppose, at this time of the year?",
  "36749": "Can people please each other too much?",
  "36750": "What, you know him, do you?",

  "36765": "And you know what that word means?",
  "36766": "Don't you wish it were you?",
  "36767": "What it was like?",
  "36768": "In what month?",
  "36769": "What does the executioner?",

  "36842": "And what may be the ages of these two, ma'am?",
  "36843": "Who, then, would not imagine that such conduct as will inevitably destroy what all are thus labouring to acquire, must generally be avoided?",
  "36844": "Was she going to try to bulldoze him into submission?",
  "36845": "But what about you?",

  "36860": "Are they not our most mortal foes?",
  "36861": "How do you mean to settle this affair?",
  "36862": "Would this misery last for ever?",
  "36863": "Are you really throwing us all over, little mother?",
  "36864": "Someone in a novel, was he not?",
  "36865": "Then why is it done?",
  "36866": "Where is the white man?",
  "36867": "Who can undertake to say that he is not a sham in anything?",

  "36889": "I trust and hope you never repeated to the count all the foolish remarks we used to make about him?",
  "36890": "Why, let me see, how old are you?",
  "36891": "What else could he do?",
  "36892": "That voice?",
  "36893": "And these men were your friends?",
  "36894": "Why didn't you wait for me?",
  "36895": "What better issues could a man want?",
  "36896": "Not to be afraid really to speak?",
  "36897": "I call it a very serious thing, eh?",
  "36898": "Have you any more conditions to offer?",
  "36899": "What time did you start?",
  "36900": "And with what result?",
  "36901": "An't my place dirty?",
  "36902": "And now you will be our companion?",
  "36903": "And what is this way?",
  "36904": "Because?",
  "36905": "Which route must I take?",
  "36906": "Now, what is it you say?",
  "36907": "And do you dare look in my face, after that shameful deed?",
  "36908": "Let me ask, sir, what great exploits have you performed?",
  "36909": "Why have you come?",
  "36910": "What wages do you ask?",
  "36911": "It makes you feel very virtuous when you forgive people, doesn't it?",
  "36912": "But where are they taking her?",
  "36913": "Doing anything now, are you?",
  "36914": "It relates to some great event, then?",
  "36915": "Have you any letters of hers?",
  "36916": "How should any one coming from a wider world not feel the difference and be attracted by it?",
  "36917": "And how is it she has not pride enough to see it?",
  "36918": "Is she feeling the same as I?",
  "36919": "What is his extent?",
  "36920": "Then the truth is too bad to tell?",
  "36921": "Can this be, then?",
  "36922": "But this black?",
  "36923": "Which is your house?",
  "36924": "Where else can he be?",
  "36925": "What should I be but for you?",
  "36926": "Ah, then, you do not love me?",
  "36927": "Many of them?",
  "36928": "Oh, you do, do you?",
  "36929": "And this is a letter, is it?",

  "36935": "Do you love me still?",
  "36936": "Which is the way out, please?",
  "36937": "Now, what's your name?",
  "36938": "How can it, by coming quickly into the eyes and ears, distinguish the pleasing from the disgusting in external objects?",
  "36939": "You love it, do you?",
  "36940": "And, yet, how could it be otherwise?",
  "36941": "Why had this agent preserved silence?",
  "36942": "They include, I presume, correspondence?",
  "36943": "How can you not know?",
  "36944": "Who of any dignity would take the trouble to clear cobwebs from a wild man's mind after such language as this?",
  "36945": "But how came he to be there?",
  "36946": "Do you wish to destroy me?",
  "36947": "Don't you think that rather too late?",
  "36948": "And he who is most skilful in preventing or escaping from a disease is best able to create one?",
  "36949": "What remained to her of primitive virtue?",
  "36950": "This, sir?",
  "36951": "Jo, dear, what is it?",
  "36952": "How would you like to have some tableaux in here?",
  "36953": "With this boy?",
  "36954": "Do you know who I am?",
  "36955": "When I spoke in confidence to your brother, could I regard him as an inquisitor?",
  "36956": "Did you court her for her wealth?",
  "36957": "Have I met you and passed you already, unknowing, unthinking and blind?",
  "36958": "You are acquainted?",
  "36959": "But what would be the use of new continents?",
  "36960": "Have I kept my promise, yes or no?",
  "36961": "There used to be a certain amount of solidity in all things, but now what happens?",
  "36962": "Because I love the court?",
  "36963": "Can one ever tell anyone what one is feeling?",
  "36964": "When the company was gone, my master asked my father, if he smoked?",
  "36965": "Who knows how easy it is for ambition to call itself vocation?",
  "36966": "Was it my mother's or my father's act?",
  "36967": "Is this a carelessness, or what?",
  "36968": "Weak?",
  "36969": "Aren't you ashamed of yourself, a husky young chap like you in mufti when men are needed in the trenches?",
  "36970": "Might they not hang him at once, and inquire into his case afterward?",
  "36971": "What do they say?",

  "36973": "Do you think this would be the first time a woman had repented of an infidelity?",
  "36974": "Do you think our little girl here need be afraid?",
  "36975": "Can you tell me why you foster the cruel deception?",
  "36976": "What else has the world given me for all that I have done for it?",
  "36977": "And what good will it do you?",
  "36978": "The servants can't miss the way?",
  "36979": "Why joke?",
  "36980": "What is he like, uncle?",
  "36981": "And is not the truest pity, when a man has a sore point, not to touch it at all?",
  "36982": "But you couldn't see what they were like, in the dark, lad, I suppose?",
  "36983": "Are you satisfied?",
  "36984": "Surely no man is trying to kill you either by fraud or by force?",
  "36985": "Who would hear her?",
  "36986": "Do you not see that they are all giving me the wink, and wanting me to turn you out by force, only I do not like to do so?",
  "36987": "What's the good of asking yourself if you know you don't know?",
  "36988": "And are you glad to see me?",
  "36989": "And what is the pay?",
  "36990": "Has he now some disciples?",
  "36991": "To sleep?",
  "36992": "What'll it be?",
  "36993": "But a little rakish, hey?",
  "36994": "With friends like that, who needs enemies?",
  "36995": "A bride?",
  "36996": "Or what is become of them?",
  "36997": "Is he indeed, sir?",
  "36998": "He will not talk to me about it, so why should I trouble him?",

  "37008": "But why should I make a long story?",
  "37009": "If error is possible there, why not here?",
  "37010": "Nothing else?",
  "37011": "You say 'What are they regarding?",
  "37012": "Have you not left off your impudent pretensions there yet?",
  "37013": "That is all true, then, is it?",
  "37014": "Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary clothes on?",
  "37015": "May we see it now?",
  "37016": "What's to be done?",

  "37422": "What is the voice of history?",
  "37423": "Wouldn't you just love to be rich, girls?",
  "37424": "You are setting off, then?",
  "37425": "And he really succeeded?",
  "37426": "You have not heard then of what they are accused?",
  "37427": "You have a chart, haven't you?",
  "37428": "Why should he come again?",
  "37429": "What sort of a figure would he make if he escaped?",
  "37430": "Can it be possible?",
  "37431": "You don't mean to tell me you don't care about spiders?",
  "37432": "How you gwyne to git 'm?",
  "37433": "How you must have hated me after THAT evening?",
  "37434": "You wouldn't put yourself in opposition to the interests of your husband and child, would you?",
  "37435": "Mary, to me?",
  "37436": "And YOUR cheese, your excellency?",
  "37437": "And yet you saw how she thanked me, with her so beautiful dying eyes, her voice, too, so weak, and she kiss my rough old hand and bless me?",
  "37438": "In what respects?",
  "37439": "Had I caught her off her guard?",
  "37440": "And why does the weight know how to find it by so short a line?",
  "37441": "Can you have any difference with your father?",
  "37442": "Going away, sir?",
  "37443": "What's it about?",
  "37444": "Then it is he whom you suspect?",
  "37445": "What is your rank?",
  "37446": "And ruined her character?",
  "37447": "Why wish to fly till you have got your wings?",
  "37448": "Pretty well?",
  "37449": "The executioner, in short?",
  "37450": "Where the deuce can they have gone?",
  "37451": "A merchant?",
  "37452": "Why don't I love you?",
  "37453": "What that you say?",
  "37454": "Does it now only exist in my memory?",
  "37455": "What can I say to him?",
  "37456": "How do I pay my rent?",
  "37457": "Which did she choose?",
  "37458": "May I ask what position she holds in your household?",
  "37459": "What right have we to say that this is the people's will?",
  "37460": "If he was his confederate, why should he carry his photograph?",
  "37461": "Are beauties there as proud as here they be?",
  "37462": "Why, when the body is putrefying?",
  "37463": "Why then is it a crime to kill?",
  "37464": "And if not, what else did she imagine?",
  "37465": "Were you not, gentlemen, both in the musketeers of the late king?",
  "37466": "How long his he been there?",
  "37467": "What is this oven for?",
  "37468": "Nay, will not such a one often rejoice more than any other in the rich show of outer apparel?",
  "37469": "What does that nonsense mean?",
  "37470": "Would the selfish and the cowardly ever lack reasons for yielding to the enemy?",
  "37471": "Is he at home now?",
  "37472": "Do you see any inconvenience in having an army at the end of a year, instead of two regiments?",
  "37473": "Forgiveness?",
  "37474": "Well, in what case is it just that the tax should take the form of a levy on polls?",
  "37475": "Are they dead or alive?",
  "37476": "Do you know anything of it, fellow?",
  "37477": "What preservation can you now desire after the destruction of your temple?",
  "37478": "I'm busy, can't ye see?",
  "37479": "What cared he for all the rest?",
  "37480": "And what she said to you?",
  "37481": "Did you want a coffin, sir?",
  "37482": "Did you ever suppose you'd see the day when you'd be adopting an orphan girl?",
  "37483": "I wonder if this can be the person we're looking for?",
  "37484": "First, then, they resemble one another in the value which they set upon wealth?",
  "37485": "What did he repeat to us all the day?",
  "37486": "What are you saying to her?",
  "37487": "You're dancing, are you?",
  "37488": "Hate you, sir?",
  "37489": "Would you know him again?",
  "37490": "If I consent to announce you, may I at least know whom to announce, monsieur?",
  "37491": "What's wrong with my face?",
  "37492": "Had that begun in your time?",
  "37493": "Never been there?",
  "37494": "Is he not in love?",
  "37495": "What did she answer?",
  "37496": "Do you dare to say that I am not right?",
  "37497": "You don't know that?",
  "37498": "What are the facts?",
  "37499": "Somebody has called?",
  "37500": "He has retired, hasn't he?",
  "37501": "What use will peace be when he is no longer here?",
  "37502": "The inhabitants of the island and the sailors?",
  "37503": "You've got a mark upon you somewheres or another, I suppose?",
  "37504": "Where are all the listeners and spies who accompany the queen?",
  "37505": "What is this gnawing of conscience I am feeling now?",
  "37506": "What, are they gone, sirs?",
  "37507": "Whom the deuce can it be from?",
  "37508": "You didn't see her in there, did you?",
  "37509": "Need there now be any secrets between us?",
  "37510": "Was not he sent for?",
  "37511": "When was it received?",
  "37512": "But why on earth should you be pursued with such animosity?",
  "37513": "Didn't he tell you?",
  "37514": "Further, there can be no doubt that a work is spoilt when not done at the right time?",
  "37515": "What is it in your hand?",
  "37516": "What arrangement, squire?",
  "37517": "Whence did it come?",
  "37518": "How does my honoured mother?",
  "37519": "Do you remember that I paid it you ten days later, and you put it at the bottom of the tobacco?",
  "37520": "Did he mention the precise order of occupation to which he would addict himself?",
  "37521": "But be seated, and tell us now what is the cause of your docility?",
  "37522": "What the devil right have you to interfere?",
  "37523": "Has he decided to do so?",
  "37524": "And with how many fingers does he bless?",
  "37525": "Do you think I cannot see?",
  "37526": "If I preserve my purity in the society of the trees, why should he who would have me preserve it among men, seek to rob me of it?",
  "37527": "What had happened to bring this shocking change about?",
  "37528": "DID you see all the diamonds those ladies wore?",
  "37529": "How is that?",
  "37530": "With that?",
  "37531": "Did you recognize?",
  "37532": "What have we done, what has this poor thing done, that we are so sore beset?",
  "37533": "Must hate and death return?",
  "37534": "Why not view it often by faith?",
  "37535": "They are not fit for me, are they?",
  "37536": "Any lazy idle loafers that want flogging in this class?",
  "37537": "Why, then, do I not hear them?",
  "37538": "Do you accept my solution of the mystery?",
  "37539": "Not one year, madame?",
  "37540": "Was it right or wrong?",
  "37541": "Have you understood how our dog was so strangely thrown up out of the water of the lake, after his struggle with the dugong?",
  "37542": "How have you defended me?",
  "37543": "What are their sufferings?",
  "37544": "How about the widows and orphans confided to you?",
  "37545": "What have you got to do with the dew, ma'am?",
  "37546": "Is life to be purchased by such a sacrifice?",
  "37547": "What tell you me of fasting days?",
  "37548": "And have the children looked after themselves at all, sir?",
  "37549": "A dress for you, also, is it not, my friend?",
  "37550": "Coavinses?",
  "37551": "Had we a river, a lake, a sea to depend upon?",
  "37552": "But nobody possesses it, so what would you have?",
  "37553": "You have made it up?",
  "37554": "When is it to be done?",
  "37555": "How, then, could they provide for themselves, and when had they time to plough and sow their fields?",
  "37556": "Was her husband, to whom it legally belonged, to make it over to her as a free gift?",
  "37557": "Is what you hear at church, religion?",
  "37558": "And what enlargement do you expect to obtain in this way?",
  "37559": "Plans?",
  "37560": "What might be the consequences?",
  "37561": "Aren't you going to save those six monkeys who are giant soldiers?",
  "37562": "Would she have pitied him had she seen him?",
  "37563": "Aronnax?",
  "37564": "In your own heart, do you feel quite certain?",
  "37565": "But won't they know we're not?",
  "37566": "Or you, my lords, to be my followers?",
  "37567": "It is true?",
  "37568": "Then in time of peace justice will be of no use?",
  "37569": "But how could you guess what the motive was?",
  "37570": "What did you think of that?",
  "37571": "When will you come?",
  "37572": "Is it possible, then, to love, if you are not loved?",
  "37573": "Will you be her servants?",
  "37574": "Would she never issue from it?",
  "37575": "There's nothing wrong?",
  "37576": "NOT a party in anything, ma'am?",
  "37577": "Then what?",
  "37578": "Supper?",
  "37579": "Can anyone do much for anyone else unless by making a will in his favour and dying then and there?",
  "37580": "Did we not leave her, but just now?",
  "37581": "Then?",
  "37582": "Has anything worried you?",
  "37583": "And who shall then stick closest to ye, and excite others?",
  "37584": "What has occurred?",
  "37585": "Can I rely upon you?",
  "37586": "Kill the women?",
  "37587": "Oh, you are the young feller who did that poster?",
  "37588": "I suppose you don't even know what a prig is?",
  "37589": "Don't you wish for anything else?",
  "37590": "Do you know of any houses?",
  "37591": "Do you mean to say that this slip of paper will help us?",
  "37592": "What identity?",
  "37593": "Did you bring the things I mentioned?",
  "37594": "But, my lord, if there be no secret of penitence, will the director consent to my being here?",
  "37595": "Do you have a faith, or a knowledge, you follow, which helps you to live and to do right?",
  "37596": "Is not this what we would have all men do to us?",
  "37597": "Well, there wasn't anything else for her to do, was there?",
  "37598": "You hussy, how dare you talk in that way?",
  "37599": "Now, what shall we do?",
  "37600": "Which should it be?",
  "37601": "Would not I have wished, do you think, to have learned all the truth about the matter before I answered him?",
  "37602": "Will you follow me?",
  "37603": "What else can I do?",
  "37604": "How would you like to come into a house and find everyone muttering to themselves?",
  "37605": "And can the just by justice make men unjust, or speaking general can the good by virtue make them bad?",
  "37606": "You're sure?",
  "37607": "Prime, isn't it?",
  "37608": "Are we to see profound wisdom in this?",
  "37609": "Is it not, said she, whispering her husband in his ear, is it not a noble nose?",
  "37610": "Who'll keep THEM quiet?",
  "37611": "Had any difference arisen between him and her papa?",
  "37612": "And what shall I?",
  "37613": "Not so much so?",
  "37614": "You are fond of it?",
  "37615": "May I see it?",
  "37616": "Tell me, do you know what the countess, for whose pardon you are beseeching me, has done?",
  "37617": "Had she not openly avowed her intention of marrying for money if she ever had the chance?",
  "37618": "That the boy may sink and perish?",
  "37619": "Whose there?",
  "37620": "Been there long?",
  "37621": "Which is the way?",
  "37622": "Or his starch'd beard?",
  "37623": "Who knows what may be in store for you yet?",
  "37624": "By this?",
  "37625": "And not long?",
  "37626": "Is that certain?",
  "37627": "Isn't it well drawn?",
  "37628": "Are you asleep?",
  "37629": "Any ideas?",
  "37630": "Have we been deceived by an illusion?",
  "37631": "Was it physical?",
  "37632": "Caution?",
  "37633": "Did not you know that, my dear lord?",
  "37634": "Did not your friend here look like me?",
  "37635": "What are you rattling in there?",
  "37636": "But again, will they tell us that such a nature, placed under favourable circumstances, will not be perfectly good and wise if any ever was?",
  "37637": "Has not one of you a cross?",
  "37638": "What happened to the worthy captain?",
  "37639": "And what does the judge affirm to be the life which is next, and the pleasure which is next?",
  "37640": "Was my uncle stark mad?",
  "37641": "You didn't think it could be so bad?",
  "37642": "You mean she won't mind?",
  "37643": "Or have we found angels in the forms of kings to govern him?",
  "37644": "More in your brains than in your pocket, eh?",
  "37645": "He has come, then, as they told me?",
  "37646": "The only unofficial detective?",
  "37647": "Have you had lunch yet?",
  "37648": "Far from here?",
  "37649": "And what credit can the poor clerk of a procurer have, pray?",
  "37650": "Whither is it carrying me?",
  "37651": "And where are they looking for her?",
  "37652": "Can't you see that I'm as hoarse as a crow?",
  "37653": "But where is your master?",
  "37654": "Who told you this?",
  "37655": "Of what was he thinking?",
  "37656": "Do you think it is too much?",
  "37657": "D'you remember you were rather sniffy about meeting him?",
  "37658": "Is that what you wished to say?",
  "37659": "How much of the ballast of conservatism and of loyalty to tradition is it well to throw overboard in the interest of accelerated motion?",
  "37660": "Shall a similar end be pursued for the ethical purpose of widening the circle of those who shall live and be happy?",
  "37661": "Why have they not seized me?",
  "37662": "When did it happen and what has happened?",
  "37663": "You see?",
  "37664": "How could we like a people who treated us so unjustly?",
  "37665": "When shall the day come when we shall lift our hands?",
  "37666": "Are you then making a thesis?",
  "37667": "Would you like me to bring some rice?",
  "37668": "Who do you want?",
  "37669": "How did he get 'em?",
  "37670": "You wouldn't leave him lying maimed at the bottom of this dreadful place, a moment, if you could bring help to him?",
  "37671": "And is my life to be forfeit, is some terrible punishment to come on my poor old head for that which I cannot help?",
  "37672": "You will be frank with me?",
  "37673": "And was that the head and front of his offending?",
  "37674": "And must he not be represented as such?",
  "37675": "Yes, don't you wish you knew what that card was?",
  "37676": "But what's he doing here?",
  "37677": "He said nothing more?",
  "37678": "And even if he has done wrong, how do I know that he has not condemned himself?",
  "37679": "And do they give you frogs to eat, so's to make you limber?",
  "37680": "A doctor?",
  "37681": "What did you do?",
  "37682": "Would he allow imitation to be the ruling principle of his life, as if he had nothing higher in him?",
  "37683": "Wasn't it rather sudden?",
  "37684": "That's what you tell this gentleman too, is it?",
  "37685": "He's your husband, eh?",
  "37686": "Can I spare him?",
  "37687": "What now?",
  "37688": "Armed?",
  "37689": "Or may not all three be properly allotted to it?",
  "37690": "Anything up?",
  "37691": "Is that so?",
  "37692": "You do not wish to hear it, perhaps?",
  "37693": "What does it matter to me?",
  "37694": "And will not a true astronomer have the same feeling when he looks at the movements of the stars?",
  "37695": "Why, what else are they?",
  "37696": "And s'pose he steps in here any minute, and sings out my name before I can throw him a wink to keep quiet?",
  "37697": "And the just is the good?",
  "37698": "How have I deviated from those principles, monsieur?",
  "37699": "But why FOUR pounds?",
  "37700": "And what did you find?",
  "37701": "What has he come here for?",
  "37702": "Are you inside?",
  "37703": "Downright?",
  "37704": "Do you think she'll miss you?",
  "37705": "Speak I sooth, my masters?",
  "37706": "Why was it necessary to weave the queen into this gloomy web of guilt and crime?",
  "37707": "I suppose that is why you live in town?",
  "37708": "What was the result of that memorable expedition?",
  "37709": "What, then, is the defence?",
  "37710": "What do you mean by risk?",
  "37711": "What would be the use?",
  "37712": "How could she make such nails work?",
  "37713": "Am I not the wife of my husband?",
  "37714": "What came after?",
  "37715": "What is the proposition?",
  "37716": "So?",
  "37717": "How is the snatchblatch?",
  "37718": "Just?",
  "37719": "Did you hear anything of it when you were in those parts?",
  "37720": "What is in this?",
  "37721": "And through what deplorable madness had she thus ruined her life by continual sacrifices?",
  "37722": "Where are the marks of its fangs?",
  "37723": "What d'you say to having something to eat?",
  "37724": "Who was this novice in war with the effrontery of a luminary?",
  "37725": "In my precinct?",
  "37726": "Is she, my lord?",
  "37727": "May this young lady go with us?",
  "37728": "Has no one come to seek her in this land?",
  "37729": "Hadn't we better hear it tomorrow?",
  "37730": "Then you'll be free?",
  "37731": "Monseigneur?",
  "37732": "Is it not sad?",
  "37733": "Can people enchant each other too much, cajole each other too much, charm each other too much?",
  "37734": "Why do they grease the axles of the wheels?",
  "37735": "If there be doubt as to which of our divisions will get our candidate, is there no doubt as to which of your candidates will get your party?",
  "37736": "What did you take me to your mother for?",
  "37737": "Are you going alone into that blackamoor's den?",
  "37738": "And did they ask you to make a speech?",
  "37739": "Don't you see it is hard enough for her already?",
  "37740": "Some such object it was, that induced you to call on me?",
  "37741": "But how about money?",
  "37742": "You here at this hour?",
  "37743": "Well, then, was it this eye or that through which you dropped the beetle?",
  "37744": "What did your excellency say?",
  "37745": "Where are you going, you rascal?",
  "37746": "Do you know, my friends, what that plain, seen from the height we are at, resembles?",
  "37747": "What was the good of bringing him?",
  "37748": "Where was it?",
  "37749": "Would she be decent to him, or would she scold him?",
  "37750": "Which is the best wish to wish him?",
  "37751": "How CAN you say 'I am happier,' and nothing changed?",
  "37752": "Why sadden the poor children, and damp their newly cherished hopes?",
  "37753": "And you feel convinced that you must break with him?",
  "37754": "Alone, where?",
  "37755": "And you saw him frequently?",
  "37756": "Who are you, white man?",
  "37757": "Why is she so glad?",
  "37758": "But why do you ask?",
  "37759": "What new treasures lay here for science to unfold?",
  "37760": "What do ye want?",
  "37761": "Rochester?",
  "37762": "What's coming on?",
  "37763": "Are we to wonder, then, if here and there we find in his works an offensive expression?",
  "37764": "Why not cut it?",
  "37765": "What does the letter mean, mother?",
  "37766": "Are we rising into a fiery furnace?",
  "37767": "What substances will you proscribe?",
  "37768": "And what method of surveillance do you employ?",
  "37769": "Oh, well, as it were, what?",
  "37770": "You think so?",
  "37771": "Of how much?",
  "37772": "Hardly remembered me?",
  "37773": "But we could not prevent it, could we?",
  "37774": "You get your percentage out o' the purchase, I suppose?",
  "37775": "Food enough for all?",
  "37776": "Why doesn't she want it now?",
  "37777": "On the other hand, would he not, by remaining to meet a fate almost inevitable, incur the guilt of suicide?",
  "37778": "Has she told you she likes me much?",
  "37779": "Why should I envy them?",
  "37780": "What did he say to you?",
  "37781": "But if he were taken back again he would imagine, and truly imagine, that he was descending?",
  "37782": "My friend, my friend, why thus grieve me?",
  "37783": "How does that strike you?",
  "37784": "Forty pounds?",
  "37785": "You'll have to, then, won't you?",
  "37786": "But I mean another piece?",
  "37787": "Are all voters enlightened?",
  "37788": "And his level, whether higher or lower, could it possibly be the same as hers?",
  "37789": "What makes you so sure?",
  "37790": "What is it in the nature of the oak that causes it to send its root down into the soil and to drink up of its substance?",
  "37791": "What's he going to read?",
  "37792": "Where shall I go?",
  "37793": "What was the primitive tissue?",
  "37794": "How much do you pay a week?",
  "37795": "Why shouldn't I conscientiously?",
  "37796": "And he is named?",
  "37797": "How came you by the knowledge?",
  "37798": "Is it not one part of honesty to be dutiful and grateful to your master, do you think?",
  "37799": "Why not win to freedom?",
  "37800": "Does he?",
  "37801": "And if not in the worst, why is it to follow at all?",
  "37802": "What, pray?",
  "37803": "Wherefore?",
  "37804": "But how have they endeavored to explain these lines of light?",
  "37805": "Shall I be that?",
  "37806": "And what shall we say of such things as religious duties, of cheerfulness, of good manners, of personal cleanliness?",
  "37807": "Or, have you been a bad steward to yourself, and wasted your property in lawsuits and the like?",
  "37808": "Ah, who put it up?",
  "37809": "But light?",
  "37810": "What has opened her eyes?",
  "37811": "Do you want him?",
  "37812": "It's red, ain't it?",
  "37813": "And would you indeed damn your precious soul?",
  "37814": "Well, did you see her safely off?",
  "37815": "But is he engaged to her?",
  "37816": "Why, how are all the folks at home?",
  "37817": "Are these persons, then, so rich and powerful?",
  "37818": "Can it give heat to a dead body?",
  "37819": "Don't you think so?",
  "37820": "Where's the use of looking nice, when no one sees me but those cross midgets, and no one cares whether I'm pretty or not?",
  "37821": "And the king has seen the cardinal?",
  "37822": "Detain him?",
  "37823": "And return to life, if there be such a thing, is the birth of the dead into the world of the living?",
  "37824": "Or do you also hate the duke your husband?",
  "37825": "Do you know who it is from?",
  "37826": "Have you been to the opera?",
  "37827": "Not a word to your loving mother, who was growing older too?",
  "37828": "Would you be at ease, and feel that you had played an open part?",
  "37829": "Has your majesty no other orders to give me?",
  "37830": "But what are you going to do with him, now he is alive?",
  "37831": "And what shall I do when papa and you leave me, and I am by myself?",
  "37832": "Why is he sleeping there?",
  "37833": "Had he not told her, yes, told her to make a list, and not to admit anyone who was not on that list?",
  "37834": "Were her fears realized?",
  "37835": "I suppose it bowled the poor blighter over absolutely?",
  "37836": "Who introduced this innovation?",
  "37837": "You are perhaps a tulip fancier?",
  "37838": "May I go in and look?",
  "37839": "When will we be married?",
  "37840": "You're in the habit of shaking hands?",
  "37841": "And which is wise and which is foolish?",
  "37842": "But then he had the woman he loved still remaining?",
  "37843": "Shall I then?",
  "37844": "All ready forward?",
  "37845": "Is there any one here?",
  "37846": "But can such a head be found?",
  "37847": "And ten?",
  "37848": "Do you think if I drink water it would take off this hiccup?",
  "37849": "And this one opposite, who is this?",
  "37850": "Neither may they imitate smiths or other artificers, or oarsmen, or boatswains, or the like?",
  "37851": "You'll be ready this day week, will you?",
  "37852": "What was become of them?",
  "37853": "Shall we gather strength but irresolution and inaction?",
  "37854": "And what was in the sealed iron chest?",
  "37855": "Shall I put a little more tea in the pot afore I go, ma'am?",
  "37856": "And what can you conceive more deadly?",
  "37857": "Why did you do it?",
  "37858": "What does she want?",
  "37859": "How do you know about it, and who are you, anyhow?",
  "37860": "What next?",
  "37861": "Deserted?",
  "37862": "When did you get in?",
  "37863": "Will it hit us?",
  "37864": "Do you want to be doing the same?",
  "37865": "Who will bring us bread?",
  "37866": "My friend, what do you tell me?",
  "37867": "Their whistle?",
  "37868": "Where in the world did you get that song?",
  "37869": "Is he very clever?",
  "37870": "Fine stepper, wasn't she?",
  "37871": "Who did I get the statues from?",
  "37872": "Will you have some whiskey and water?",
  "37873": "What news?",
  "37874": "And am I not a hundred times better thus?",
  "37875": "Struck me?",
  "37876": "And you are up?",
  "37877": "What point?",
  "37878": "Don't you know me?",
  "37879": "What is the use of one horse for us two?",
  "37880": "The cardinal was your protector?",
  "37881": "Isn't it splendid to be that kind, teacher?",
  "37882": "Are the other camels better or worse than that?",
  "37883": "Isn't what they have done already enough?",
  "37884": "What two lines?",
  "37885": "At twenty minutes to nine?",
  "37886": "Whom have I to love?",
  "37887": "And the rocks with their various strata?",
  "37888": "Did I not say right?",
  "37889": "What could he, an old man, do?",
  "37890": "And now what does he do?",
  "37891": "Is he so?",
  "37892": "And would it not be the height of absurdity to call such a man fickle and inconsistent, because he had repeatedly altered his judgment?",
  "37893": "Can't you comprehend that an affection may be genuine as felt by the man, yet its nature be spurious in relation to others?",
  "37894": "Then, at all events, he DID sleep here, did he?",
  "37895": "My name?",
  "37896": "And why should I not?",
  "37897": "How could I escape from this situation?",
  "37898": "Don't you know what it means to me?",
  "37899": "Which was the more important, which the less important part?",
  "37900": "You call them that, too?",
  "37901": "But by what means?",
  "37902": "Not come yet?",
  "37903": "Ever hear of lones the packer, hey, ole chappie?",
  "37904": "Is it quite original?",
  "37905": "Did he do that?",
  "37906": "Why should he trust himself to a balloon, that would blaze up like a piece of paper?",
  "37907": "Now, an't it?",
  "37908": "And don't I suppose his was the first face she saw, as she passed through the storm and the night to that waiting, beautiful place?",
  "37909": "You saw it?",
  "37910": "Like him?",
  "37911": "Would you take a seat, sir?",
  "37912": "And yet what else am I to do?",
  "37913": "Well, have you heard from your husband lately, my dear?",
  "37914": "You refused him?",
  "37915": "How did you know that?",
  "37916": "Can she make your real flecky paste, as melts in your mouth, and lies all up like a puff?",
  "37917": "Whence comes this?",
  "37918": "Yes, what is it?",
  "37919": "Should he stay at home with her, her mother and her sisters?",
  "37920": "What can I do to prevent it?",
  "37921": "Have been brought together, eh?",
  "37922": "Would you like to come up and see her?",
  "37923": "What would you like to do tomorrow?",
  "37924": "Will that arrangement suit you?",
  "37925": "And you shall be included in it, in our happiness, do you hear, father?",
  "37926": "FLOATED?",
  "37927": "Have you eaten anything?",
  "37928": "How d'you know I want to travel?",
  "37929": "Did she feel as he did?",
  "37930": "Water to drink?",
  "37931": "You will not serve me, sir, will you?",
  "37932": "How should he be?",
  "37933": "Again, has he greater experience of the pleasures of honour, or the lover of honour of the pleasures of wisdom?",
  "37934": "Is it nothing to hold one's peace?",
  "37935": "And you can do nothing until then?",
  "37936": "When, where?",
  "37937": "Is there generally?",
  "37938": "Yes, but still all this has to be looked after, and who is there to look after it?",
  "37939": "You a chief, eh?",
  "37940": "How much will you give me for it?",
  "37941": "What have I to say to them?",
  "37942": "Now what do you think on't, neighbour, my friend?",
  "37943": "When are you coming back?",
  "37944": "Can anyone be surprised if one gets fond of such a ship?",
  "37945": "Oh, not her?",
  "37946": "But what is worship?",
  "37947": "Why do you not speak to me?",
  "37948": "In arms against me?",
  "37949": "Do you wish for a proof?",
  "37950": "I can't say more than that, can I?",
  "37951": "Where, then?",
  "37952": "Prove?",
  "37953": "Little woman?",
  "37954": "Shall it be said, good reader?",
  "37955": "Are you glad to leave us, dear?",
  "37956": "What had that harsh tyrant of hers done that was good or serviceable for her?",
  "37957": "And the mistress?",
  "37958": "Can one be well while suffering morally?",
  "37959": "Where would be that thrill if I had been as definite as a timetable?",
  "37960": "How long otherwise?",
  "37961": "Tony, where are you going, my charmer?",
  "37962": "What does this tell us?",
  "37963": "How does she use you?",
  "37964": "Have you nothing else to ask him, sir?",
  "37965": "In the nick of time?",
  "37966": "How?",
  "37967": "Mind it?",
  "37968": "How can I help myself?",
  "37969": "Where has he gone?",
  "37970": "That visit not succeeding either, you will go again perhaps?",
  "37971": "Husband, are you as kind and gentle toward your wife as you should be?",
  "37972": "For what is death?",
  "37973": "If I see, clearly see, that ladder leading from plant to man, why should I suppose it breaks off at me and does not go farther and farther?",
  "37974": "Lively?",
  "37975": "Another glass?",
  "37976": "But the great point is, is there a 'Rita' on the list?",
  "37977": "Don't you hear?",
  "37978": "What was the difference whether the alms were given into my hands or into my wife's?",
  "37979": "Do you tell me that the woman is dead?",
  "37980": "Did he take that medicine, men?",
  "37981": "Who would suppose it?",
  "37982": "That lady in black over there?",
  "37983": "When was that done which settled the matter?",
  "37984": "What did you say, sir?",
  "37985": "Well and what am I to do now?",
  "37986": "I couldn't do anything better for her than advise her to accept these proposals, could I?",
  "37987": "What would be the result of a total extraction of the nitrogen?",
  "37988": "Do you not suspect?",
  "37989": "Did it keep you awake?",
  "37990": "Did he think that pride or masterful will or physical strength would help him?",
  "37991": "Need any help, officer?",
  "37992": "What's that so black agin' the sun?",
  "37993": "What's the row now?",
  "37994": "Why are you so bad?",
  "37995": "She never spoke to a soul?",
  "37996": "DO you think race corresponds with nationality?",
  "37997": "Could I ever have believed then that I could come to such humiliation?",
  "37998": "Do you belong to the nobility?",
  "37999": "D'you think they care for us?",
  "38000": "You bring me great news, then, monsieur?",
  "38001": "Did I say above, or seem to imply, that the judge sometimes spoke harshly to his wife?",
  "38002": "Not in health?",
  "38003": "And we have admitted that justice is the excellence of the soul, and injustice the defect of the soul?",
  "38004": "Did you really?",
  "38005": "What was he doing?",
  "38006": "Didn't you know the difference yourself?",
  "38007": "Is he out of his senses?",
  "38008": "Who then?",
  "38009": "Why do I feel so inclined to tease him?",
  "38010": "What monstrous place is this?",
  "38011": "Why can't you leave me alone?",
  "38012": "Where is the use of our reckoning?",
  "38013": "Why isn't it your business?",
  "38014": "Then you don't wish me to, dearest?",
  "38015": "You are AFRAID of it?",
  "38016": "Don't they come after it any more?",
  "38017": "Where is the prisoner?",
  "38018": "Is he generally liked?",
  "38019": "Do you mean write to her myself?",
  "38020": "So soon?",
  "38021": "Genius, or insanity, who can say?",
  "38022": "Will not the guardians be the smallest of all the classes who receive a name from the profession of some kind of knowledge?",
  "38023": "A telegram?",
  "38024": "That's the boy, is it?",
  "38025": "At whose house?",
  "38026": "Is this possible, count?",
  "38027": "Which of them do you call her best friend?",
  "38028": "Am I not imprisoned, fettered?",
  "38029": "Is sugar always to be produced by vital blood?",
  "38030": "Was it a fear that he should deliver this name to the hazards of another memory than his own?",
  "38031": "You think it's certain he's there?",
  "38032": "Would they not have been as unwilling to part with them as with gold, and have compelled them to stay at home with them?",
  "38033": "Who did you pass on the road?",
  "38034": "What could she do but sob?",
  "38035": "What was that you told me before we left the old house?",
  "38036": "Beautiful and lusty?",
  "38037": "And is not the soul almost or altogether indissoluble?",
  "38038": "Buried amongst them, what met my eye?",
  "38039": "Yes, isn't it extraordinarily fine?",
  "38040": "What is the matter with him?",
  "38041": "Might he not well inform the doctor that he had something to tell him for his advantage?",
  "38042": "But how can we gain your freedom?",
  "38043": "Or is this a subject in which new discoveries can be made?",
  "38044": "Or haven't you pluck enough to go on?",
  "38045": "Has he got to be harnessed up and driven through life like a horse?",
  "38046": "What to do with him?",
  "38047": "If she had died, or if we hadn't caught her, where should we all have been?",
  "38048": "Assuming also, again I say, that physical obstacles can be overcome, is not the time opportune for making a start?",
  "38049": "Yeh infernal fool, don't yeh know enough t' quit when there ain't anything t' shoot at?",
  "38050": "Why should it?",
  "38051": "Don't you love to ride?",
  "38052": "Are you badly hurt?",
  "38053": "Has he many men, then?",
  "38054": "Will there be mercy for me there?",
  "38055": "I hope your father is well?",
  "38056": "Why then am I dissatisfied if I am going to do the things for which I exist and for which I was brought into the world?",
  "38057": "I tell you?",
  "38058": "You are no longer my father?",
  "38059": "And why, my young friend?",
  "38060": "If we were jurymen, what would we do with this parricide?",
  "38061": "What did they do it for then?",
  "38062": "Can you rely on his word?",
  "38063": "Why the coal country?",
  "38064": "Is that possible?",
  "38065": "What the prime cause of all my woe doth prove?",
  "38066": "Well, brigadier, what is he charged with?",
  "38067": "Look here, what does this mean?",
  "38068": "Liver?",
  "38069": "Will you not speak to them?",
  "38070": "Why, who are you, bold fellow, to range so boldly here?",
  "38071": "You want to speak to me, do you?",
  "38072": "And where is the wounded officer?",
  "38073": "And afterwards?",
  "38074": "What is your illustration?",
  "38075": "Well, you must be most starved, ain't you?",
  "38076": "He has still hope, but what is it he hopes?",
  "38077": "In a tree?",
  "38078": "The question is, whether it procures most pain or pleasure?",
  "38079": "What's the matter with your legs?",
  "38080": "Who says that?",
  "38081": "How can I play a trick on a monkey?",
  "38082": "What kind of a bird is he?",
  "38083": "But how did you come here?",
  "38084": "Then it is settled?",
  "38085": "Where am I to die?",
  "38086": "What ought to be done?",
  "38087": "How now?",
  "38088": "Isn't she split in half?",
  "38089": "But will you tell me?",
  "38090": "And do the enchanted sleep, now, senor?",
  "38091": "Is there anything else you would like?",
  "38092": "And you DO think something better of me than you did?",
  "38093": "What do I want with the lawyer?",
  "38094": "Shall I not visit for these things?",
  "38095": "You couldn't quite call it poetry, I suppose, but it sounds a lot like it, doesn't it?",
  "38096": "And how did it go so fast, so straight ahead, with such staring, staring eyes?",
  "38097": "Should I have to hand over?",
  "38098": "Do they love?",
  "38099": "What should be done with the elephant, which had been so dearly purchased?",
  "38100": "Was he not handsome?",
  "38101": "In making him a duke?",
  "38102": "How can you dare to speak to me like that?",
  "38103": "Whose was it?",
  "38104": "How did I lose her?",
  "38105": "Well, and what did the lady do?",
  "38106": "This has been done so often, and what good has ever come from it?",
  "38107": "Where do the lord and lady sleep?",
  "38108": "But whither am I wandering?",
  "38109": "With what kind of order?",
  "38110": "But do you think we shall find the count at home?",
  "38111": "And what I am, to you my friends, now am I not?",
  "38112": "Do you conceive any thing but merely that perception?",
  "38113": "Don't you wish you may get it?",
  "38114": "Who are these men you have brought before us?",
  "38115": "Some one holds you in restraint?",
  "38116": "Did you think he came directly from town?",
  "38117": "Will you breakfast with me tomorrow morning?",
  "38118": "Dearest, what?",
  "38119": "What's the news?",
  "38120": "Why don't you ask some nice people in to dinner?",
  "38121": "And had you made up your mind what to say to him?",
  "38122": "Is not the president's shoulder still bleeding from the blow it has received?",
  "38123": "Wiggins?",
  "38124": "Oh, when are you going?",
  "38125": "Why should I care?",
  "38126": "What could you do for a boy like that?",
  "38127": "Does it think?",
  "38128": "Why should we ask what comes after the experience, when the experience is still unknown to us?",
  "38129": "Was he not the prince of men?",
  "38130": "Are not these dread words for a nation bearing in her bosom so mighty an injustice?",
  "38131": "What has happened?",
  "38132": "How is a woman to live if she doesn't know how much she has got to spend?",
  "38133": "On what days?",
  "38134": "Or what hopes have we of deliverance by thus continuing faithful to such wicked wretches?",
  "38135": "Who's accused you?",
  "38136": "What's one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one?",
  "38137": "But the question again recurs, upon what pretense could he be put in possession of a force of that magnitude in time of peace?",
  "38138": "What can I do for the son?",
  "38139": "What, after the last?",
  "38140": "That I might lose them?",
  "38141": "Who is my mother?",
  "38142": "You want a lot, don't you?",
  "38143": "Don't you find, that things fail to materialise?",
  "38144": "Why not let me send for this pleasant lady?",
  "38145": "Where have you come from?",
  "38146": "Will somebody obleege me with a spittoon?",
  "38147": "Do you think it is a wig?",
  "38148": "You sat in front of his writing desk?",
  "38149": "Where could my uncle be at that moment?",
  "38150": "Does he not want anything else?",
  "38151": "Why should I guard me?",
  "38152": "Why, will the black footman tell tales?",
  "38153": "Mayn't I treat you as a lover?",
  "38154": "Why did he not tell it?",
  "38155": "What was the reply?",
  "38156": "Did business men commonly go into an expenditure of money which could be of no account to them?",
  "38157": "And then, in the next place, was it probable that the dean would act upon such a letter by filling up the vacancy, even if he did get it?",
  "38158": "And if not, WHO IS IN THE ROOM besides you and me?",
  "38159": "You don't regret?",
  "38160": "What did you stay talking to him for, if you didn't want un?",
  "38161": "Must it of necessity be admitted that this power is infringed, so long as a part of the old articles remain?",
  "38162": "Had any papers been handed about among them, similar to these lists?",
  "38163": "Shall I go?",
  "38164": "On what charge do you expect to be arrested?",
  "38165": "But what can we expect from a turnip?",
  "38166": "And what am I now?",
  "38167": "A widow, ma'am?",
  "38168": "Well, what happened when you did get there?",
  "38169": "You say two faces were familiar to you?",
  "38170": "You opened the letter?",
  "38171": "But what are all these birds doing in heaven?",
  "38172": "For your own credit and for the sake of money, of course?",
  "38173": "Is this, also, some enchanted person?",
  "38174": "But what was it?",
  "38175": "I mean to say, what?",
  "38176": "Ha, friend?",
  "38177": "And what about his wife and family?",
  "38178": "Is it necessary that a bourgeoisie which stands in such need of you should disown you?",
  "38179": "Suppose he were taken prisoner again?",
  "38180": "Now, my good fellow, how are you?",
  "38181": "She was about to say?",
  "38182": "Do you have a teaching?",
  "38183": "Has labor, once so fecund, likewise become sterile?",
  "38184": "Then what do you talk of?",
  "38185": "A signal for others?",
  "38186": "Who, and what are you?",
  "38187": "What then is that which is able to conduct a man?",
  "38188": "Well, what are these buildings?",
  "38189": "What does he want to go out for again?",
  "38190": "You know that great pause that comes upon things before the dusk?",
  "38191": "You wish me, then, to relate the history of my past sorrows?",
  "38192": "What the charm that floats the bowl?",
  "38193": "When did that happen?",
  "38194": "Are you sure they can be relied on?",
  "38195": "What will come of it all?",
  "38196": "Was there any mention made of my uncle or me?",
  "38197": "In what does it consist?",
  "38198": "Then I am not to be allowed to have anything to do with it officially?",
  "38199": "Can I go, can I go?",
  "38200": "You won't mind my working in your room this afternoon, will you?",
  "38201": "Is she a friend of yours?",
  "38202": "Or will you be my friend, as you have been hitherto, and do what I request?",
  "38203": "Do you mean it?",
  "38204": "What is that queer concern going down the river?",
  "38205": "Are you sure he can't get away?",
  "38206": "Was that all she said I said?",
  "38207": "But how cast off all the superfluous, devilish burden of my outer man?",
  "38208": "Why then is that rather a misfortune than this a good fortune?",
  "38209": "There now, what is it?",
  "38210": "Anything in the gruff and grumble way?",

  "39397": "And he bowed to you like this?",
  "39398": "But what of the resemblance?",
  "39399": "Was it good for you?",
  "39400": "How are they even to be discovered?",
  "39401": "Where do you suppose she's gone to?",
  "39402": "Did you ever, when thinking much of your own importance, find yourself suddenly reduced to a nonentity?",
  "39403": "No, no?",
  "39404": "Could you not utter one squeak in your own defence?",
  "39405": "So correspondent to the bearer's state?",
  "39406": "You're not going anywhere in particular, are you?",
  "39407": "How few authors or artists have arrived at eminence who have not lived by their employment?",
  "39408": "That'll fetch her, I think, eh?",
  "39409": "Are your eyes troubling you?",
  "39410": "Why did we not find it sooner?",
  "39411": "A book in the library?",
  "39412": "Where do you live, young maid?",
  "39413": "Why not you step out of the narrow circle which, as I have shown, is all of noble life your laws and customs allow?",
  "39414": "Which way should I turn?",
  "39415": "Who else could hold you thus?",
  "39416": "What tricks?",
  "39417": "If they did happen, is it reasonable to suppose that you will make yourselves and others more happy by one course of conduct or by another?",
  "39418": "What do they say of him?",
  "39419": "And how runs this maxim?",
  "39420": "How could I draw back, and how could I confess?",
  "39421": "Well, don't you understand that that's exactly what I'm working for?",
  "39422": "Is there a row about me?",
  "39423": "Why should there be sin?",
  "39424": "Has she been very ill?",
  "39425": "Where but from the oar with which so long he fought the sea?",
  "39426": "Don't you remember that you were saying yourself the other day, of the absurdity of combatting pretences which the world sanctions?",
  "39427": "When did you get drunk last?",
  "39428": "Who are you at all?",
  "39429": "Then you abandon me, doctor?",
  "39430": "Does he like the trade?",
  "39431": "And why at all, since it is the custom to pay revenue to the king?",
  "39432": "Will you dine here?",
  "39433": "Oh my, ain't that odd?",
  "39434": "Could I abandon the unhappy subjects intrusted to my care?",
  "39435": "And the end or use of a horse or of anything would be that which could not be accomplished, or not so well accomplished, by any other thing?",
  "39436": "What shall I say to you?",
  "39437": "Do you think that trade is so good I could afford to keep two boys, when there isn't half work enough for one?",
  "39438": "Notice your arm's sore?",
  "39439": "Then why flaunt yourself before this booby, as you have been doing?",
  "39440": "But how will you manage to get out?",
  "39441": "But why not both?",
  "39442": "BUT if objects for gratitude and admiration are our desire, do they not present themselves every hour to our eyes?",
  "39443": "And did she inform you what I went to do?",
  "39444": "And with what did you contrive to make that?",
  "39445": "But about the hospital, papa?",
  "39446": "But suppose he loses his seat?",
  "39447": "What?",
  "39448": "Why not advance science in its most difficult and vital aspect, the knowledge of the brain?",
  "39449": "And you, sir?",
  "39450": "Has it reference to what you said just now?",
  "39451": "Into what thicket?",
  "39452": "What would be a reward suitable to a poor man who is your benefactor, and who desires leisure that he may instruct you?",
  "39453": "Perhaps you were acquainted with somebody who was a party in something, ma'am?",
  "39454": "So you will then betray our love to him?",
  "39455": "The wind still sits in that quarter, does it?",
  "39456": "And whence has he his power?",
  "39457": "What did he?",
  "39458": "Want?",
  "39459": "Should you like eggs, sir?",
  "39460": "My brethren, wherefore is there need of the lion in the spirit?",
  "39461": "Does that question offend you?",
  "39462": "Has he got anything seriously the matter with him?",
  "39463": "Then why not make himself known at once?",
  "39464": "If he had liked his wife so much why did he hate her garden?",
  "39465": "Is it because LIBERTY implies it, or because property prohibits it?",
  "39466": "Have you quite forgot us poor critturs?",
  "39467": "Is it the old pain, my precious?",
  "39468": "And what is that?",
  "39469": "How does it stand now?",
  "39470": "In what respect?",
  "39471": "How could a man be satisfied with a decision between such alternatives and under such circumstances?",
  "39472": "Cuthbert?",
  "39473": "Was this word needful?",
  "39474": "No doubt you think that very absurd?",
  "39475": "Monsieur, my majordomo, will there be a pie?",
  "39476": "Were they?",
  "39477": "How could you have written it yourself?",
  "39478": "But what's this?",
  "39479": "How should they carry its burden?",
  "39480": "What is it, madam?",
  "39481": "What's the matter with you, shipmate?",
  "39482": "What on earth did you want to bring this one for?",
  "39483": "What on earth?",
  "39484": "But what was he doing, that he could not trouble to write?",
  "39485": "It was too warm in the room, was it not, count?",
  "39486": "What are you up to here?",
  "39487": "And why was that?",
  "39488": "I mean a way two horses and a van can travel over?",
  "39489": "Have they a party there?",
  "39490": "On the life before you, do you mean?",
  "39491": "Are you thinking of commissions in hand?",
  "39492": "Supposing, then, you get your hat and we both go?",
  "39493": "Where are the sentiments of my heart?",
  "39494": "Are there bears on your place?",
  "39495": "What have I said and what have I done?",
  "39496": "To whom was this addressed?",
  "39497": "Who knows him here?",
  "39498": "Who can forbid your indulgence in any whim?",
  "39499": "Has anything particular happened in the neighborhood?",
  "39500": "That is not quite so common, is it?",
  "39501": "If you don't know why don't you say so?",
  "39502": "But if we possessed this power, would it be wise to exercise it under existing circumstances?",
  "39503": "Has any one told you he means to make me one?",
  "39504": "What was his handwriting like?",
  "39505": "What do you think?",
  "39506": "Still?",
  "39507": "And with the hearing, I said, we hear, and with the other senses perceive the other objects of sense?",
  "39508": "You mean to say that the people, from whom he has derived his being, will maintain him and his companions?",
  "39509": "One a fat sleek man?",
  "39510": "But why?",
  "39511": "How can such a person be the master of things?",
  "39512": "Ah, go away, dummy, how about the girls?",
  "39513": "But what does the dazzling day to the south conceal?",
  "39514": "Or something of that sort?",
  "39515": "Since I've been away?",
  "39516": "What is to be done in such a case?",
  "39517": "How did you do it?",
  "39518": "Is it he?",
  "39519": "Where are they, sweetheart?",
  "39520": "Did you have a good time last night?",
  "39521": "Does he not work his will harmfully as well as in love by agencies?",
  "39522": "Is the king well?",
  "39523": "Ah, you haven't?",
  "39524": "How long are you going to wait?",
  "39525": "What if some volcanic burst should one day raise these two barriers above the waves?",
  "39526": "He loves me, but how?",
  "39527": "What do I live for?",
  "39528": "And by what means could it be achieved?",
  "39529": "And who are they?",
  "39530": "Isn't it fine?",
  "39531": "But would you ruin me?",
  "39532": "Wasn't I dreadfully untidy?",
  "39533": "Why have you taken off your mask?",
  "39534": "Won't he run away?",
  "39535": "Mamma, how did papa make you an offer?",
  "39536": "Will you not tell me of my husband?",
  "39537": "Why don't you?",
  "39538": "See anything?",
  "39539": "Ah, and you have not?",
  "39540": "Must one first batter their ears, that they may learn to hear with their eyes?",
  "39541": "Have you ever betrayed to him so much, as a syllable of that which stirs our hearts?",
  "39542": "What will the country say?",
  "39543": "Tess, you wonder why I have followed you?",
  "39544": "Could one, with any feeling, live as he is living with me?",

  "39554": "Is he not greatly improved?",
  "39555": "Who'll hear us say our prayers?",
  "39556": "What verses?",
  "39557": "And what does YOUR heart say?",
  "39558": "What, for me only?",
  "39559": "Why?",
  "39560": "Why do I strive, why do I toil in this narrow, confined frame, when life, all life with all its joys, is open to me?",
  "39561": "What work, then?",
  "39562": "What is the matter with you, my man?",
  "39563": "A fraud?",
  "39564": "Was I vain fool so frantic, household traitor so consummate?",

  "39572": "How is it that, being from the south, you come to fish on our coasts?",
  "39573": "What word of compromise was there about it?",
  "39574": "Why such a conquering hero?",
  "39575": "Was you indeed, commander?",
  "39576": "Esther, my dear, do you wish to ask me anything?",

  "39608": "Really?",
  "39609": "Like a bad dream come true, wasn't it?",
  "39610": "How shall I begin?",

  "39630": "Not much the matter, I hope?",
  "39631": "Where shall I put up?",
  "39632": "What about the left flank?",
  "39633": "And what don't you like about them?",

  "39728": "Well, doctor?",
  "39729": "Well, then, why do you want to leave me?",
  "39730": "What will be the consequence, if we are not able to avail ourselves of the resource in question in its full extent?",
  "39731": "Well, well, and what about me?",
  "39732": "Do you see the story?",
  "39733": "From which it would seem, my dear count, that you can at pleasure enjoy the seraphic strains that proceed from the seven choirs of paradise?",

  "39735": "What new occurrence is it that makes this tranquil old woman tremble so?",
  "39736": "And does your mamma know it, and yet wish you to marry him?",
  "39737": "Is it, then, a crime, oh foolish man, to put away that which stands between us and our ends?",
  "39738": "Aren't we going to look for those diamonds?",
  "39739": "Hello, grandfather, why are you sitting there looking so downhearted?",

  "43377": "What did you do that for, any way?",
  "43378": "You are not going out?",
  "43379": "Well, my dear?",
  "43380": "What is the cause of all that dust?",
  "43381": "Wasn't it a joke?",
  "43382": "So we will not say anything about it, or let them take her away?",
  "43383": "Does that interest you?",
  "43384": "Does he believe that I think of a wretched fiddle when the spirit speaks to me?",
  "43385": "But to whom should I say that?",
  "43386": "What do they aim at proving?",
  "43387": "And have I found where thy money lies?",
  "43388": "Who is ambitious?",
  "43389": "Don't you say, dear d'Artagnan, that it is the queen who has made choice of the convent for her?",
  "43390": "Why do we value the morning glory, which fades in a few hours, more than an artificial glass flower, which endures hundreds of years?",
  "43391": "Come, what did she say?",
  "43392": "Doctor, what would you think now of my getting married?",
  "43393": "Is she absolutely unapproachable?",
  "43394": "Why will it vex itself, and twist its little face into bewitching nutcrackers?",
  "43395": "What, now, directly?",
  "43396": "While we are ignorant whether a man were aggressor or not, how can we determine whether the person who killed him be criminal or innocent?",
  "43397": "But how far was their advice to be respected?",
  "43398": "Was there another such a wretched being as she in the world?",
  "43399": "Why be so distressed?",
  "43400": "Will you speak it to whom I wish?",
  "43401": "That's what you mean, is it?",

  "43410": "Can we not escape from this country?",
  "43411": "What shall we do now?",
  "43412": "But when I tell you I am married, is it not a consequence that we must have new clothes?",
  "43413": "You know it well, then?",
  "43414": "A lover on a day of farewell, a husband on a day of revenge, or the one whose head it had graced on the day of despair?",
  "43415": "So you will manage the empty coffin?",
  "43416": "But was the dawn wonderful?",
  "43417": "Nobody came into the room at all?",

  "43426": "Why won't you try and be good?",
  "43427": "What has she to reflect about, who must obey?",
  "43428": "Why this delay?",
  "43429": "Do his fits begin like that?",
  "43430": "Is there some new reason for this banishment?",
  "43431": "Will you give me that?",
  "43432": "Ah, you knew that?",
  "43433": "Where is the standard of perfection to be found?",
  "43434": "What order do you refer to?",

  "43443": "Whar'll I be, when a stone goes six times as far as it does on heah?",
  "43444": "What force has a multitude?",
  "43445": "Are you sure you can do it carefully, my worthy man?",
  "43446": "Is mine less hard to bear or is it harder to bear, when my whole living was in it and has been thus shamefully sucked away?",
  "43447": "Of what nature?",
  "43448": "What doth the lad mean?",
  "43449": "Is it strange that a man whose kindness is thus abused, should send sheriff's officers to reclaim what is due to him?",
  "43450": "And where did he get it, mamma?",
  "43451": "I will appeal to any of these gentlemen, could I leave my guest in the hands of a hideous bandit, as you term him?",
  "43452": "What people are you leading thus into the bowels of the earth?",
  "43453": "But not actually raining?",
  "43454": "Was there anything peculiar about any of those skeletons?",
  "43455": "And why didn't I go away, now, if I couldn't bear her?",
  "43456": "How does opium induce sleep?",
  "43457": "Quite so, but how was it to be done, how to prevent it?",
  "43458": "What can he mean by all this about money?",
  "43459": "But what happened thereupon?",
  "43460": "Who are you at all?",
  "43461": "And do you know what reward we shall offer them?",
  "43462": "About breakfast?",
  "43463": "What right had the friendless to complain?",
  "43464": "If I ran your unfortunate friend through the body, what did I do with the body?",
  "43465": "Did your client commit the robbery?",
  "43466": "You suppose that it will be good?",
  "43467": "Is it a dream of pain, or of pleasure?",
  "43468": "Why did you not stop him till I came?",
  "43469": "But once more, what is there to fear?",
  "43470": "Are not two prayers a perfect strength?",
  "43471": "Will you have a cigarette?",
  "43472": "Was not this man more to be feared than death itself?",
  "43473": "And what are you crying for?",
  "43474": "Have you any reason to suspect robbery?",
  "43475": "Didn't I say that your police were good for nothing?",
  "43476": "You have suffered a great deal, sir?",
  "43477": "Do you take me for a brute?",
  "43478": "What did you do it for?",
  "43479": "Do you know what they fought about?",
  "43480": "D'ye think me, noble general, such a sot?",
  "43481": "Why should she taunt him this way unless she had good grounds?",
  "43482": "And are you very sure that we have done nothing before we were born?",
  "43483": "What is it that induceth you, what stirs you up to believe, or who told you that white signifieth faith, and blue constancy?",
  "43484": "And can ALL the flowers talk?",
  "43485": "Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?",
  "43486": "Who are you, aged man?",
  "43487": "Did you take his number?",
  "43488": "Don't you expose it to a good deal of excitement, sir?",
  "43489": "Then what's the use of my money to me?",
  "43490": "Can I ever make amends for this murder and this crime?",
  "43491": "You know him?",

  "43497": "And how is your wrist?",
  "43498": "And the balloon withstood it?",
  "43499": "Month by month things were stepping livelier, but to what goal?",
  "43500": "Shall I help him?",

  "43530": "Are bodies placed in canoes?",
  "43531": "Would you not be happier if you tried to forget her severity, together with the passionate emotions it excited?",
  "43532": "May I ask what that signifies?",
  "43533": "So, sir, and what say you?",
  "43534": "Why shouldn't we make them real?",
  "43535": "Besides, why should he have mentioned it?",
  "43536": "What great things to lift them above the level of their fellows?",
  "43537": "And why had she kept it hidden?",

  "43545": "Percy did what?",
  "43546": "Can we have the honor of seeing his highness?",
  "43547": "What was the nature of this air?",
  "43548": "Was there a great sensation?",
  "43549": "But if he hasn't been spreading it, how do you know?",
  "43550": "Then why do you do it, if it's a clear loss?",

  "43600": "Was your father a professional man?",
  "43601": "Don't I sit before you, every way, just as much a man as you are?",
  "43602": "Was he so sure that he would enjoy wearing clothes again?",
  "43603": "You recognise then that you've failed?",
  "43604": "Where's your husband?",
  "43605": "Is it not inevitable that reflective men, who cherish beliefs, should endeavor to give a more or less clear and reasoned account of them?",
  "43606": "Who asked me to face the situation and accept it?",
  "43607": "Besides, must not justice be done and our education be finished?",
  "43608": "But how fair?",
  "43609": "Who is that lady?",
  "43610": "See whom?",
  "43611": "Could she bear to think of sinking to his?",
  "43612": "How can you reconcile that with his conduct this morning?",
  "43613": "Had he the right to disarrange anything in the condition of the corpse before the official investigation?",
  "43614": "Had he meant to warn her that day?",
  "43615": "Eh?",
  "43616": "By what right, sir?",
  "43617": "And the forbidding principle is derived from reason, and that which bids and attracts proceeds from passion and disease?",

  "43696": "Will you not estimate your own weakness?",
  "43697": "Count, is it wrong of me to sing?",
  "43698": "But who can limit the extent to which the federative principle may operate effectively?",
  "43699": "And what was the question?",
  "43700": "But surely your excellency will be so good as to inform me whom you are expecting to receive?",
  "43701": "What are you frightened of?",
  "43702": "And wherein can the blind advantage him?",
  "43703": "So long as we know?",
  "43704": "Where do you come from then?",
  "43705": "This is very sad news, but you will excuse me if I say that I do not see how it bears on the subject of your inquiry?",
  "43706": "And can't we cross that in a boat?",
  "43707": "Is that the word?",

  "44956": "More what, guardian?",
  "44957": "We had to consider, first, whether our proposals were possible, and secondly whether they were the most beneficial?",
  "44958": "What think you of that?",
  "44959": "Whither are you bound?",
  "44960": "Where so much of industry, with so little noise and bustle?",
  "44961": "I wonder what becomes of that kind when it goes up country?",
  "44962": "But how about our prisoners?",
  "44963": "The schooner?",
  "44964": "Why, had he more aiders then?",
  "44965": "Has he been making love to either of you?",
  "44966": "What's the use of fighting?",
  "44967": "Just boss?",
  "44968": "But what could it indicate?",
  "44969": "Why have you caused me thus to fail in my word towards a gentleman like the count, who has all our lives in his hands?",
  "44970": "Shall we feed the children by waiting?",
  "44971": "What kind of ice pudding?",
  "44972": "But what the deuce was the name?",
  "44973": "Marchiali?",
  "44974": "Shall I give you the change, my officer?",
  "44975": "What is there of good to be expected?",
  "44976": "And you know, likewise, by what sign the associates may recognize the general?",
  "44977": "What name do you give him first?",
  "44978": "You love no one?",
  "44979": "Where am I to wait for her?",
  "44980": "Absolutely drunk, eh, with my magnificence ?",
  "44981": "How about my heart?",
  "44982": "What do you mean by a horse?",
  "44983": "Do you think I wish to do otherwise for one moment?",
  "44984": "What would the patron think?",
  "44985": "That is to say, before we were born, I suppose?",
  "44986": "Have they the monk?",
  "44987": "How can one know such things?",
  "44988": "You ask me why I turn on you?",
  "44989": "A bullet did you say?",
  "44990": "What did they care for the public road?",
  "44991": "Is all the soot washed from my face?",
  "44992": "He visits them?",
  "44993": "Is it a third, or akin to one of the preceding?",
  "44994": "Not content with going abroad, why does she want to go back there at once?",
  "44995": "You were not happy with him?",
  "44996": "Stop dat ar, now, will ye?",
  "44997": "Why, uncle, what do you take me for?",
  "44998": "And am I not sorry?",
  "44999": "What have I to do with sundials and papers?",
  "45000": "May I have them?",
  "45001": "With a pile?",
  "45002": "But he was ready for anything?",
  "45003": "How old did you say you were?",
  "45004": "When shall I go?",
  "45005": "And now, what shall we do with our prize?",
  "45006": "If heaven has found the way to make a good use of his money, are we to set ourselves up against the answer to our prayers?",
  "45007": "What's a pris'ner?",
  "45008": "You will not believe in him, who requires but a prayer, a word, a tear, and he will forgive?",
  "45009": "Beauty?",
  "45010": "What did you mean it to be made of?",
  "45011": "What can decent men do?",
  "45012": "But how do things look when we turn our attention to the relations between states?",
  "45013": "Is it sunshine to cheer and lighten the hearts of others?",
  "45014": "Why did you not come out at the door?",
  "45015": "Do you understand none of this?",
  "45016": "Why do you think so badly of me?",
  "45017": "Quick of ear?",
  "45018": "You got my telegram?",
  "45019": "Then, it's not so?",
  "45020": "What is the amount of the angle?",
  "45021": "I've got my wits, what does that mean?",
  "45022": "How can I, if her husband fails in controlling her?",
  "45023": "You are going to live here, are you not?",
  "45024": "Is it?",
  "45025": "Jane?",
  "45026": "It's a corker, ain't it?",
  "45027": "Then you have nothing more to do here?",
  "45028": "What's happening here?",
  "45029": "How dare they laugh at me in your house?",
  "45030": "Have I ever given him any occasion to owe me a grudge?",
  "45031": "Well, what if I am?",
  "45032": "What was it he shouted?",
  "45033": "But for a man, is it manly?",
  "45034": "Not the message?",
  "45035": "Did you get any?",
  "45036": "Not clear?",
  "45037": "Did he fall while you were on him?",
  "45038": "Ay, ay?",
  "45039": "Do you think the birds will come here?",
  "45040": "It don't put you out, do it, my lord?",
  "45041": "Would she not?",
  "45042": "But how had the mystic thing been caught?",
  "45043": "Is it possible that you disown me?",
  "45044": "But what did give you that turn?",
  "45045": "With me?",
  "45046": "What do you mean, ma'am?",
  "45047": "You think then she's secretly wretched?",
  "45048": "What else did he go to school for?",
  "45049": "Which of them is more pointed or terse in his periods, or employs more polished and elegant language?",
  "45050": "Of course you have come back hungry?",
  "45051": "Keggs, there are a number of outside men helping here tonight, aren't there?",
  "45052": "But where did you pass the night?",
  "45053": "For where is the straw that stuffs my body?",
  "45054": "But what can have happened?",
  "45055": "How have things been going?",
  "45056": "How can I tell you?",
  "45057": "Don't you see how it is?",
  "45058": "Why had such a splendid boy, so full of life, to die?",
  "45059": "Where do you live?",
  "45060": "Home here?",
  "45061": "I wonder if they noticed you?",
  "45062": "Is this unity?",
  "45063": "Do you wish to play the braggart with an unarmed man?",
  "45064": "Ought one to fear what the world may say in a case like this?",
  "45065": "Didn't I keer for see 'em blaze?",
  "45066": "If it had been my ears, what should I have done?",
  "45067": "But weren't you fearfully tempted?",
  "45068": "Who was the other?",
  "45069": "It was, then, a part he was playing?",
  "45070": "The duke asked him, if distress had made him so bold, or if he were a rude despiser of good manners?",
  "45071": "Didn't I tell you we would come to an enchanted palace?",
  "45072": "You have used your power, sire, you will not abuse it, will you?",
  "45073": "Dear me, sir, why didn't you send your young man round for me?",
  "45074": "Arrest me?",
  "45075": "Then why was he sent to that place with them?",
  "45076": "What do you do here, sir?",
  "45077": "He'll do, I think, my dear?",
  "45078": "Can he make deathless death?",
  "45079": "What does the giant say to the pigmy?",
  "45080": "Where may its like be found?",
  "45081": "Who is there among you of all his people?",
  "45082": "Can you always get in another show?",
  "45083": "Who is this abbot?",
  "45084": "What would you have, my friend?",
  "45085": "Will they attack, do you think?",
  "45086": "Do you wish, in order to prevent business stagnation, to limit production strictly to the necessary amount?",
  "45087": "To see fashions?",
  "45088": "He won't go, eh?",
  "45089": "?????",
  "45090": "And what was this man's name?",
  "45091": "This plan was all very well, but how was it to be put into execution ?",
  "45092": "Should his request be granted, who would you like as his successor?",
  "45093": "What for?",
  "45094": "If a ship had passed near by us what would the sailors have said?",
  "45095": "Anna, why distress yourself and me so?",
  "45096": "You admit attacking the plaintiff?",
  "45097": "Are poisoned fountains necessary, and stinking fires, and filthy dreams, and maggots in the bread of life?",
  "45098": "Who would employ a boy of my age on a farm or in a factory?",
  "45099": "And what sort of a picture would that make?",
  "45100": "What is the matter with you, my dear?",
  "45101": "But why should I be amused?",
  "45102": "What are these warnings?",
  "45103": "Is it so terrible to be old?",
  "45104": "Will you tell me where you are going, you wretch?",
  "45105": "Did I make a contract with him in the forest, and sign it with my blood?",
  "45106": "Ah, she likes to be liked?",
  "45107": "What makes you talk like that?",
  "45108": "Where can I go?",
  "45109": "Where is MY home?",
  "45110": "Did you hear that?",
  "45111": "Whom shall I announce?",
  "45112": "Said I not rightly that we are a wonderful people?",
  "45113": "To whom is she to be married?",
  "45114": "And are suits decided on any other ground but that a man may neither take what is another's, nor be deprived of what is his own?",
  "45115": "How did you bear your disappointment?",
  "45116": "And you have learned nothing from any other quarter?",
  "45117": "But in what consists this preference?",
  "45118": "And the prince was pleased with you?",
  "45119": "How do we learn anything at all?",
  "45120": "But what about this interminable war?",
  "45121": "And the spider?",
  "45122": "What were they?",
  "45123": "Now what do you think of that?",
  "45124": "Can he bring a suit against him to recover his business and property?",
  "45125": "In such a matter as what?",
  "45126": "Where was she?",
  "45127": "Am I rude?",
  "45128": "Will you admit so much?",
  "45129": "Well, are you having a pleasant journey?",
  "45130": "Have you no present interest in any of the company who occupy the sofas and chairs before you?",
  "45131": "What is the lowest you will take for him?",
  "45132": "And why expose his own children in the battle?",
  "45133": "Look here, young man, are you sure you've no idea where your sister is?",
  "45134": "Are there lights in the windows?",
  "45135": "So you've been here a whole hour?",
  "45136": "How could I live an alien in that house where I had been the child?",
  "45137": "Shall you stay there?",
  "45138": "Who has not heard of the hardest drinker in all the army?",
  "45139": "Wasn't he fed, poor thing?",
  "45140": "Would it be kindness?",
  "45141": "And how shall we manage the period between birth and education, which seems to require the greatest care?",
  "45142": "How do you know she has?",
  "45143": "It was running wild after the girls may be?",
  "45144": "He sent some one?",
  "45145": "Who would know so well as you how to teach the lesson of endurance to others?",
  "45146": "Did I not think so?",
  "45147": "By making them stronger for each other's aid, will you make her less willing to discharge a lighter than a greater responsibility?",
  "45148": "What had this condor discovered then?",
  "45149": "But when your father comes back tomorrow what am I to tell him?",
  "45150": "Oh, do you then know him?",
  "45151": "And you think it quite right?",
  "45152": "Then, again, within the city, how will they exchange their productions?",
  "45153": "Believe what?",
  "45154": "Now, my boy, which house is it?",
  "45155": "Perhaps, concerned only for his imminent doom, he had not had sincere sorrow for his sin?",
  "45156": "How can we help?",
  "45157": "How could a man like him be expected to have any pleasure in such a discovery?",
  "45158": "So it was YOUR cry of distress that I heard?",
  "45159": "But do you suppose that if I had been I should have asked you to let me go and live with him?",
  "45160": "Are you coming?",
  "45161": "You think you're better'n your father, now, don't you, because he can't?",
  "45162": "Is it strife?",
  "45163": "What needs he the defence this arm can make?",
  "45164": "Do I understand it?",
  "45165": "What about the general?",
  "45166": "Is this quite just for creditors?",
  "45167": "Your brother was, I believe, unmarried, was he not?",
  "45168": "Why didn't I enter the room?",
  "45169": "What will the archbishop think of that?",
  "45170": "Less pedigree?",
  "45171": "The young fellow whose arms you held, don't you know?",
  "45172": "What was then to be done?",
  "45173": "Why did not you all learn?",
  "45174": "Does it apply well to my suit?",
  "45175": "You mean my mother?",
  "45176": "What does he think I can do with his five francs?",
  "45177": "What lunacy are you talking?",
  "45178": "How could he hope ever to grow up to be as good and wise as they, or even tolerably good and wise?",
  "45179": "Lie down?",
  "45180": "Why not, my love?",
  "45181": "More smart, is it?",
  "45182": "Can it be with me?",
  "45183": "Lord?",
  "45184": "What is the matter with you that you know them?",
  "45185": "What does he mean by using a shotgun when silence was his one chance of escape?",
  "45186": "Is the time ripe now?",
  "45187": "What will be our future condition if he should beget other suns?",
  "45188": "But why are we standing here?",
  "45189": "But who knows, madam, but somebody that shall be nameless would like me best with all my little finery about me?",
  "45190": "How dare you to insinuate that you don't know my character better than your words imply?",
  "45191": "Why had he wasted his time hunting?",
  "45192": "In the hat?",
  "45193": "What is there in your mind?",
  "45194": "You really love, then, no lady at this court?",
  "45195": "Will she be safe over there?",
  "45196": "Why shouldn't we make one fireside of it, and marry each other?",
  "45197": "Have you a mind to teach the beavers to sing?",
  "45198": "Why was this?",
  "45199": "What have you got to say next?",
  "45200": "How soon can he be here?",
  "45201": "Now, what DO you want to buy?",
  "45202": "How you come to fall out?",
  "45203": "Will he come again?",
  "45204": "You're a determined little miss, aren't you?",
  "45205": "Where have you put it?",
  "45206": "Can you provide that they shall be separated at bed and board?",
  "45207": "Did anything happen this time?",
  "45208": "Where does my father get all that iron rust from?",
  "45209": "And you choose that time for grazing?",
  "45210": "Fifteen shillings a week not much, young man?",
  "45211": "If I could do that, simpleton, where would the danger be?",
  "45212": "A natural death is better than an artificial life, surely?",
  "45213": "Children dear, were we long alone?",
  "45214": "Is this number seven?",
  "45215": "Why do you suppose that I should look severely on your affection for that young man?",
  "45216": "Is this a weather to send benevolence?",
  "45217": "Who was the criminal, then?",
  "45218": "And what reason is that?",
  "45219": "Where was the difficulty?",
  "45220": "What do I care about blood?",
  "45221": "What is that stupid fellow troubling himself about?",
  "45222": "You say I can't live but a few hours?",
  "45223": "Is this a preparation for immortality?",
  "45224": "Had I ever seen so much loathing and pale horror on one countenance?",
  "45225": "When shall we start?",
  "45226": "Did I, sir?",
  "45227": "And who can tell when these happy hours may return?",
  "45228": "Don't you remember you and I had it when we were fixing the pipes outside the projectile, when we had the other breakdown?",
  "45229": "We were saying that the parents should be in the prime of life?",
  "45230": "What about those elemental rights of representation and election which had figured in the glorious contest for freedom?",
  "45231": "Are these no capital?",
  "45232": "A little of the wine?",
  "45233": "Why did I at once experience a shock?",
  "45234": "Cannot I cut off the part and restore you by a sweat bath?",
  "45235": "Should art be taken seriously?",
  "45236": "But how are you to get that balance?",
  "45237": "Why this hostility of interests?",
  "45238": "What availed the noise and bustle of cheerful morning, which penetrated even there, to him?",
  "45239": "Have we not tramps and beggars enough already to pester us as we sit at meat?",
  "45240": "When shall it be?",
  "45241": "Can you turn a strain to the ladies, sir?",
  "45242": "Over whom?",
  "45243": "Didn't he ask you why you didn't bring him the papers?",
  "45244": "Would not jets of boiling water, constantly injected by the pumps, raise the temperature in this part and stay the congelation?",
  "45245": "What difference would that make?",
  "45246": "Or look you I should play the orator?",
  "45247": "Doth not wealth satiate, and become nauseous, and no longer serve to satisfy or pleasure, or to buy an hour's peace of mind?",
  "45248": "And did you do anything?",
  "45249": "You wouldn't let any enemy hurt me, if you could prevent it?",
  "45250": "You were going to say, thirdly?",
  "45251": "Do they really, you dog?",
  "45252": "Into a new light?",
  "45253": "Did she want to stay at home?",
  "45254": "Which building?",
  "45255": "But why should I consort, I, a brave man, with the abominable?",
  "45256": "Can you guess, now, what this is?",
  "45257": "Suppose you were a foundling and were shown our faith and yours, and asked for which you would decide, which would you choose?",
  "45258": "And how on earth would she ever manage to hold her tongue during school hours?",
  "45259": "Are we afraid of foreign gold?",
  "45260": "Was it a double tooth, hey?",
  "45261": "And how can it all be done by daybreak?",
  "45262": "After these, what resentment can remain in the heart?",
  "45263": "But if she has so absolutely failed, what then had she done?",
  "45264": "And you remember, too, the period when he began to grow fatter?",
  "45265": "What is nature?",
  "45266": "What was it that was borne in upon my mind when she stood still and looked attentively at me?",
  "45267": "And you're not frightened?",
  "45268": "Are you a politician, friend?",
  "45269": "Have you not got all the plants and stones you want?",
  "45270": "What time was it?",
  "45271": "Is it obeying your husband to disobey him on the wital subject of his business?",
  "45272": "On what grounds?",
  "45273": "What is your address in the country?",
  "45274": "How will he ever know the truth, since I shall not tell him of it?",
  "45275": "It was he who rescued you?",
  "45276": "What de devil you here for, den?",
  "45277": "What, for instance, do you mean by all that humbug about the soul?",
  "45278": "Cannot I answer your purpose?",
  "45279": "Natasha, it's magical, isn't it?",
  "45280": "To whom did he give up his sword?",
  "45281": "Would not that be a sacrifice of higher prospects for you?",
  "45282": "An't you?",
  "45283": "Say, what can cause such impotence of mind?",
  "45284": "But the doctor?",
  "45285": "What business have I with this pipe?",
  "45286": "You have a recipe for it?",
  "45287": "Hang the boy, can't I never learn anything?",
  "45288": "But she?",
  "45289": "Do you know anything about fortifications?",
  "45290": "Is there no merit in repentance?",
  "45291": "What became of you, dear?",
  "45292": "Well, what is to be done, mademoiselle, when so many wills are leagued against me?",
  "45293": "And besides, what is truth to us but the continuous progress of our mind from poetry to prose?",
  "45294": "Is there any point to which you would wish to draw my attention?",
  "45295": "Shall we go in?",
  "45296": "And how would I do it, think you?",
  "45297": "At least we can have a window?",
  "45298": "It was somewhere here?",
  "45299": "Must one die like a dog?",
  "45300": "What does that wagon contain?",
  "45301": "What's the matter with your leg?",
  "45302": "Might not some curious eye fasten on it, and divine its contents?",
  "45303": "What is the difference?",
  "45304": "Who's the other fool?",
  "45305": "Well, do you understand, monsieur?",
  "45306": "You are doing catkins?",
  "45307": "Now, how does a man search a revolving bookcase?",
  "45308": "On what ground do you venture to interfere with me, messieurs?",
  "45309": "What ails ye, man?",
  "45310": "What would be your surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness?",
  "45311": "If you're not coming yourself, give us the cards, will you?",
  "45312": "In the office?",
  "45313": "Ah, precious one, why does your lover live to see you dead?",
  "45314": "Could she be deceived as to the meaning of this?",
  "45315": "Do you really mean to say that that leg of yours is better already?",
  "45316": "Do you not think perhaps that some of the shortcoming lies with yourself?",
  "45317": "Her name?",
  "45318": "How can that be, monsieur?",
  "45319": "What duties?",
  "45320": "And suppose he can obtain his desires, is that so bad as cutting her throat?",
  "45321": "Look here, do you intend to take up you abode with us?",
  "45322": "What do you want to drink now?",
  "45323": "Carey?",
  "45324": "Happy?",
  "45325": "How old are you?",
  "45326": "Is it such as they that we are to follow?",
  "45327": "Do you not think that I also long for forgetfulness?",
  "45328": "What's this?",
  "45329": "What is the captain about?",
  "45330": "Cannot you tell him I will?",
  "45331": "Now, couldn't you swear she was going to get up in a minute?",
  "45332": "Why had he not let them know that he was still working on the case?",
  "45333": "A ghost?",
  "45334": "Will you work?",
  "45335": "Where have you been, this long, long while?",
  "45336": "What might not have happened to men?",
  "45337": "With what color of propriety could the force necessary for defense be limited by those who cannot limit the force of offense?",
  "45338": "Is it bright?",
  "45339": "How could I know he hated him?",
  "45340": "But didn't she say all about it?",
  "45341": "And all this, for what, I pray?",
  "45342": "Who told you that I loved him?",
  "45343": "Is that what you meant?",
  "45344": "And did I do it for my country's sake?",
  "45345": "Why did you get married?",
  "45346": "But what exactly am I to tell you about them?",
  "45347": "Now where will it be agreeable to you that we hold our conference?",
  "45348": "Why does fate play such tricks with poor, helpless worms?",
  "45349": "Have you ever seen a snake rise up on your path?",
  "45350": "Do passive indolent women make the best wives?",
  "45351": "What would you feel, if a man were faithless to you?",
  "45352": "Has a dog money?",
  "45353": "What do you want there?",
  "45354": "Eliza, girl, what ails you today?",
  "45355": "What is there for me to eat this evening?",
  "45356": "Is there fate amongst us still, send down from the pagan world of old, that such things must be, and in such way?",
  "45357": "Then you had some grounds for supposing he might be the culprit?",
  "45358": "How on earth did you manage to become the favorite of the king, you who have never spoken to him more than twice in your life?",
  "45359": "And your second wish?",
  "45360": "If the view from below had been most interesting and singular, how shall I describe its appearance as seen from above?",
  "45361": "What do you think of a brilliant display of fireworks?",
  "45362": "Are you cold?",
  "45363": "Not so dusty, what?",
  "45364": "Till death itself?",
  "45365": "To defend him would be to accuse herself, would it not?",
  "45366": "But do you think it will rise?",
  "45367": "As bad as all that?",
  "45368": "May it not be spoken except in private?",
  "45369": "For the story?",
  "45370": "But not as a CELEBRITY?",
  "45371": "When did you first begin this mad career?",
  "45372": "May he share your hopes?",
  "45373": "Would she so?",
  "45374": "Do you place it out at interest?",
  "45375": "I suppose that's why you never got married, uncle?",
  "45376": "But do you know why he did not come, papa?",
  "45377": "Then he is on board?",
  "45378": "Do you find the study of the lower orders interesting?",
  "45379": "Can you make any objection?",
  "45380": "It is quite decided, then?",
  "45381": "What shall I pay you for the body?",
  "45382": "Would he not rather say or do the same as his like in the same case?",
  "45383": "Stryver?",
  "45384": "But how do you and your neighbour get on about the disputed right of way?",
  "45385": "It is possible we may meet again,' and 'will it be of any consequence to you whether we do or not?",
  "45386": "Would he have to abdicate his precentorship, as he had his wardenship, and to give up chanting, as he had given up his twelve old bedesmen?",
  "45387": "What is he waiting for?",
  "45388": "Do you remember that's what you used to call them?",
  "45389": "And where is coldness so ugly as between brothers?",
  "45390": "You know you let me call you so?",
  "45391": "Where is he, then?",
  "45392": "Does the cardinal refuse to receive the king?",
  "45393": "Theurgy, magic, and sorcery?",
  "45394": "What can have happened to them all this time?",
  "45395": "What did you talk about?",
  "45396": "Why on earth do you say that?",
  "45397": "Do you know why it's called a whiting?",
  "45398": "Eyebrows?",
  "45399": "Could I forget them?",
  "45400": "Number and date taken, I suppose?",
  "45401": "Have I not borne secrets heavier than this?",
  "45402": "But, then, accidents?",
  "45403": "Do you think it would be any harm?",
  "45404": "Conrad, what is it?",
  "45405": "Is there nobody here who can sing a song to lighten the time?",
  "45406": "Bless me, how shall I behave?",
  "45407": "What harm can I do to you or to her?",
  "45408": "On me, uncle?",
  "45409": "Somebody has stolen a rabbit?",
  "45410": "Why enter into painful details, so easily divined by the intelligent reader?",
  "45411": "How do you come here?",
  "45412": "Does any answer come out of it?",
  "45413": "How can he find out his strength or weakness otherwise?",
  "45414": "Who's talking o' women?",
  "45415": "Have you never made others labor?",
  "45416": "Then I suppose they'll soon bring the white bread and the brown?",
  "45417": "So you're not tired?",
  "45418": "Ist I will be reueng'd?",
  "45419": "Does he give you sharp answers?",
  "45420": "Do we want to contemplate his mercy?",
  "45421": "What is your theory, then, as to those footmarks?",
  "45422": "And how did you find out?",
  "45423": "Are your things sent off?",
  "45424": "Why did they fancy you?",
  "45425": "Will that suit you?",
  "45426": "Feel what, squire?",
  "45427": "So, then, am I her enemy?",
  "45428": "Saturday?",
  "45429": "How do you keep it on?",
  "45430": "Then why don't they give it up?",
  "45431": "Well, what if there is a trial?",
  "45432": "What are you yourself seeking?",
  "45433": "Would I be quiet and talk rationally?",
  "45434": "Well, what can you do?",
  "45435": "But what would grammar matter if he really loved her?",
  "45436": "Has he marked himself?",
  "45437": "I ask by whose authority?",
  "45438": "Master bridegroom, where are you?",
  "45439": "Why need he bother about my tuft?",
  "45440": "Farfrae's?",
  "45441": "Are you turning up your noses?",
  "45442": "What then remained?",
  "45443": "You're getting too proud to own me afore company, are you?",
  "45444": "Your father was fortunate, then?",
  "45445": "Do you really believe that such is our aim?",
  "45446": "Could he, as he asked, stop the sea with his hands?",
  "45447": "Do you suppose THEY don't know, sir?",
  "45448": "What has she done?",
  "45449": "I've fretted my gizzard green about it, maister, but what can I do?",
  "45450": "Could it be possible that even now a remnant of that lost race inhabited the ruined grandeur that had once been their progenitor?",
  "45451": "Quite for ever?",
  "45452": "Why do you keep tramping up and down like an old hen?",
  "45453": "Is it ketching?",
  "45454": "Your opinion, if you please, on this difficult matter?",
  "45455": "As her husband was a man of means, and had doubtless returned by this time, could she not send them the money?",
  "45456": "And dark?",
  "45457": "What name would your friend like to put on it?",
  "45458": "What are you going to tell me?",
  "45459": "Aren't they laughing at me?",
  "45460": "And if you wished to die, you would choose this death, count?",
  "45461": "You hain't seen no towhead?",
  "45462": "Do you think I don't repent?",
  "45463": "What are you doing out of your studio at this hour?",
  "45464": "Is love the only thing?",
  "45465": "Oh, you didn't?",
  "45466": "For that only?",
  "45467": "And I hope you're good children, are you?",
  "45468": "How was it that no one else saw it?",
  "45469": "In our own house?",
  "45470": "Cannot you inform him that it is frightful earnest?",
  "45471": "Well, what shall we do?",
  "45472": "Why shouldn't it be?",
  "45473": "Well, then, are you the brave captain, are you the valiant blade who dispersed those who wished to burn the condemned?",
  "45474": "Will you please look into the case and restore the old man to his home if the public interest will admit?",
  "45475": "Why should we not imagine this the apartment of an honest mother?",
  "45476": "No bid?",
  "45477": "He comes to live with us?",
  "45478": "Have they come from the town?",
  "45479": "But who told you I was inactive?",
  "45480": "Can you remember any breakfast that I've had today?",
  "45481": "And what are they, captain?",
  "45482": "Well, what of it?",
  "45483": "What am I to do?",
  "45484": "Why did you leave there?",
  "45485": "What can you suppose?",
  "45486": "What drawer or tiring do you mean?",
  "45487": "Don't you ever go on an excursion?",
  "45488": "Did he say whether he had any business to speak about?",
  "45489": "Are you 'fraid of bubbles, too?",
  "45490": "I hope you have preserved the unities, sir?",
  "45491": "Martha knew about you all the time?",
  "45492": "Why did you paint him?",
  "45493": "How could you say that its relation to a knower is the only and fundamental relation for the existence of the tree?",
  "45494": "And you say in his leisure moments the worthy man was a poacher?",
  "45495": "Come, who is this man who is in the basket?",
  "45496": "You don't happen to know of any other that would be at liberty?",
  "45497": "Because I like his company?",
  "45498": "How many desperate wretches have I sent to the devil?",
  "45499": "You've got them at last?",
  "45500": "Is there no morsel bread that ye do keep?",
  "45501": "Then why so hurry me?",
  "45502": "Why do you grovel before it?",
  "45503": "Aren't men silly?",
  "45504": "Is it all a quite dead garden?",
  "45505": "Now, do you know what all this means?",
  "45506": "What are the chief sources of expense in every government?",
  "45507": "Can nothing save him?",
  "45508": "You know his guilt?",
  "45509": "What was that miracle?",
  "45510": "And what may you have to say to him?",
  "45511": "Oh, madam, let me bring you a little something?",
  "45512": "Well, now, what are your conditions, if I employ you?",
  "45513": "You have as good as informed me, sir, that you are going shortly to be married?",
  "45514": "Oh, where is there deliverance from the flux of things and from the 'existence' of penalty?",
  "45515": "Do you think he wants to die?",
  "45516": "Wheres thy lady?",
  "45517": "You don't mind my fumigating you?",
  "45518": "The only question was, had she ten or twelve?",
  "45519": "What faces are the most distinct to me in the fleeting crowd?",
  "45520": "What should you prefer?",
  "45521": "Why not, if it amuses him?",
  "45522": "Didn't anybody ever tell you?",
  "45523": "And pray, where do you consider modern music to begin?",
  "45524": "Why do we hate?",
  "45525": "And if she cast it aside, her loyalty, her promise?",
  "45526": "A prisoner?",
  "45527": "But, even relying on his good faith, would be he able to keep his promise?",
  "45528": "Haow soon?",
  "45529": "But what can I do?",
  "45530": "Where th' blazes does he git his stren'th from?",
  "45531": "You cannot say what it was?",
  "45532": "And the walks in the avenues?",
  "45533": "Who shall reveal the burning anxiety with which he throbbed to see beyond that cruel wall?",
  "45534": "What will he do?",
  "45535": "To whom shall I give the list of the children's linen?",
  "45536": "What have you said, but that I am to stay a fortnight longer?",
  "45537": "What do you think of a bite of a mouth like that?",
  "45538": "Shall I rise, madam, and pay my duty to my new aunt?",
  "45539": "Emp'ror?",
  "45540": "What other course could it pursue?",
  "45541": "Where's my ulster?",
  "45542": "What to do next?",
  "45543": "Dreadful apparition, why do you trouble me?",
  "45544": "Is she also taken away from me for ever?",
  "45545": "Would not the general loss be too great to justify such relief?",
  "45546": "How many did you get?",
  "45547": "But you like me in spite of it?",
  "45548": "Have you come from a great distance?",
  "45549": "What right have we to argue?",
  "45550": "Have you ever been there?",
  "45551": "With the king's command?",
  "45552": "And is she possessed with a devil?",
  "45553": "Upon what is opinion settled?",
  "45554": "Was it an accident?",
  "45555": "What is the good of all this romancing?",
  "45556": "Why on earth not?",
  "45557": "Montmartre?",
  "45558": "Hedn't you 'baout's well send the old man aboard?",
  "45559": "What occasions?",
  "45560": "Know not the living that the grave will swallow them up after a life of sadness and cruel misery?",
  "45561": "So, with the springtime, what was more likely than that the wild idea of escaping had come to him?",
  "45562": "He stopped hard by me, and asked if I knew who he was?",
  "45563": "What could be inside it?",
  "45564": "She is your daughter?",
  "45565": "Where could it a come from?",
  "45566": "A murderous attack?",
  "45567": "Has this place any local appellation?",
  "45568": "Shall I strike it, sir?",
  "45569": "Why do you talk to me like this?",
  "45570": "What can he do here?",
  "45571": "You're not racing?",
  "45572": "Shall it lie unproductive in the public vaults?",
  "45573": "What are you looking at now?",
  "45574": "Why went he there?",
  "45575": "Oh, is that all?",
  "45576": "Or is this not true, is there no such thing as pure accident?",
  "45577": "Alas, who shall now comfort the good margrave's wife?",
  "45578": "That book is quite closed?",
  "45579": "What do you expect me to say?",
  "45580": "Am I?",
  "45581": "Are you happy?",
  "45582": "Why all this coldness, O my best beloved?",
  "45583": "Well, but where have you left the ladies?",
  "45584": "Have you come to meet me?",
  "45585": "And suppose that they were to attack the upper part of the balloon, what would you do?",
  "45586": "May I beg your pardon again, if I inquire what you mean, sir?",
  "45587": "Leave?",
  "45588": "Ever, as long as you live?",
  "45589": "Was ever such an account of a dynasty given?",
  "45590": "Don't you think it's pretty rough not to let her go to the picnic when she's so set on it?",
  "45591": "Is the cloth taken?",
  "45592": "Adam?",
  "45593": "How did you receive that wound on your face?",
  "45594": "But what did you do yesterday after you left me?",
  "45595": "And the harmonious soul is both temperate and courageous?",
  "45596": "Now, how should I, that ne'er have squealed in your sty, know all the swine therein?",
  "45597": "But won't that mar the charming effect of my consistent shabbiness?",
  "45598": "And what do you suppose it's made of?",
  "45599": "I wonder what's become of her?",
  "45600": "O see na ye yon bonny bower?",
  "45601": "Would you have your husband constantly at your feet?",
  "45602": "Where shall you be yourself?",
  "45603": "Are not the young people growing up today, really dead before they have a chance to live?",
  "45604": "How many times have I told you to tell me at once?",
  "45605": "Is not that so?",
  "45606": "Is it more afflicting to him to leave the graves of his fathers than it is to our brothers and children?",
  "45607": "Do you think it is nonsense?",
  "45608": "And what of passion, or spirit?",
  "45609": "And will you punish him because he cannot become so?",
  "45610": "To you alone, then, may I confide my sorrows and my hopes?",
  "45611": "Then don't you like them?",
  "45612": "Now, what do you complain of?",
  "45613": "Shall I be believed?",
  "45614": "Well, and what good would that be?",
  "45615": "How do you propose to deal with the case, sir?",
  "45616": "AIN' dat gay?",
  "45617": "It was you, then, that hit me?",
  "45618": "Who is this?",
  "45619": "What amount is wanting?",
  "45620": "Do all your people grow on bushes?",
  "45621": "Were all the infinitely numerous kinds of animals and plants created as eggs or seed, or as full grown?",
  "45622": "Is it to be decided by the first dozen settlers who arrive there, or is it to await the arrival of a hundred?",
  "45623": "And what is one?",
  "45624": "What the deuce are you driving at now?",
  "45625": "To some old hag?",
  "45626": "Who's he?",
  "45627": "Did she?",
  "45628": "Do you think he'll give us a good ride?",
  "45629": "Then how used you it?",
  "45630": "Shall it be the bride or bridegroom?",
  "45631": "Will he be poison'd with a simile?",
  "45632": "Where are we going to now?",
  "45633": "What, CAPITAL?",
  "45634": "But how shall I leave him dreeft?",
  "45635": "Was she, indeed?",
  "45636": "What am I to do, then?",
  "45637": "Why don't you put a heap of stones there and pretend it is a rockery?",
  "45638": "Amicable?",
  "45639": "Oh, why did I not tell you all?",
  "45640": "How, if that be so?",
  "45641": "That she ought to go back?",
  "45642": "Don't you want to be good?",
  "45643": "Possible, my dear?",
  "45644": "Do you want to fight it?",
  "45645": "Have you anything further to say about your friend?",
  "45646": "You are crying, aren't you?",
  "45647": "But what know they more than we ?",
  "45648": "Why do artists, like mechanics, find the means to live?",
  "45649": "Can this be another vengeance of that woman?",
  "45650": "What did he want?",
  "45651": "My new blue coat as I've got on?",
  "45652": "Are you satisfied?",
  "45653": "Was ever such bad luck and such bad management, too?",
  "45654": "What is the fact?",
  "45655": "Wouldn't you like the flower table?",
  "45656": "It isn't one of your jokes, is it?",
  "45657": "Where's that huntsman from?",
  "45658": "Why should he leave the comet?",
  "45659": "You don't care much for oysters, do you?",
  "45660": "But why doesn't the duke come in?",
  "45661": "Would he be in soon?",
  "45662": "Is it her mother you're going to take her to?",
  "45663": "He offered you his hand?",
  "45664": "Whatever shall I do?",
  "45665": "What can be the signification of the uneven shrugging of her hulchy shoulders?",
  "45666": "Where is a man's resource and what can he do?",
  "45667": "And had he not moved her?",
  "45668": "But are they fully known?",
  "45669": "Secondly, what will satisfy you for the trouble of producing it?",
  "45670": "My dear cousin, can you be satisfied with such a way of spending your probation?",
  "45671": "D'you want to wash?",
  "45672": "Why, what nonsense are you telling us?",
  "45673": "Do you seek any promise from me?",
  "45674": "Or is he dead?",
  "45675": "Parry, is that all?",
  "45676": "Can't we save?",
  "45677": "What were they about?",
  "45678": "Only a bullet?",
  "45679": "And now that she did own it, what should be her course?",
  "45680": "Would its citizens approve of its doing so?",
  "45681": "These relics have a history then?",
  "45682": "This screaming mob, are they, or are they not, my subjects?",
  "45683": "Would it be much out of the way, to take me in, near the great cathedral door between the two towers?",
  "45684": "But how came you to tell me that he was so disagreeable?",
  "45685": "And how did you regulate the matter, let me know?",
  "45686": "Why have you gone out of your mind, like this?",
  "45687": "We may venture on a contest with them, may we not?",
  "45688": "And not talebearers either?",
  "45689": "Is she like him?",
  "45690": "Commission?",
  "45691": "How has he deserved this persecution?",
  "45692": "You will not communicate your letter to me?",
  "45693": "Where the devil can all the shipping be?",
  "45694": "What do you think of that letter?",
  "45695": "What did they say, then, of the disappearance of these gems?",
  "45696": "Everybody?",
  "45697": "You'd have betted a hundred pound to five, now, that you wouldn't have seen me here, wouldn't you?",
  "45698": "Are there many?",
  "45699": "Does preparation advance at all?",
  "45700": "Haven't you just told me all about it?",
  "45701": "Look, did not this stump come from thy shop?",
  "45702": "What have any of you cussed cattle to do with thinking what's right?",
  "45703": "Does he know how I'm altered?",
  "45704": "Where's the servant whose business it is to answer the door?",
  "45705": "Have they demolished it stone by stone, and uprooted the soil to the last tree?",
  "45706": "What is it about the sight of sheep that excites one so?",
  "45707": "Well, and what are you doing?",
  "45708": "I say, laddie, would you mind getting me a lemonade?",
  "45709": "Was that affair hot?",

  "45718": "I ask, whether she loves him?",
  "45719": "Besides, what was the use of seeing each other?",
  "45720": "It's a wonderful city for scholarship and religion?",
  "45721": "Come, have you committed some crime, pursued by human justice, from which I can protect you?",
  "45722": "And your old parents, are they still living?",
  "45723": "Were you of them?",
  "45724": "Have I said anything to trouble you?",
  "45725": "Have?",
  "45726": "Still at your books?",
  "45727": "How big is it?",
  "45728": "And ain't that a big enough majority in any town?",
  "45729": "Why are we stopping?",
  "45730": "Your mother hasn't relented?",
  "45731": "More often than what?",
  "45732": "What right have you to be happy?",
  "45733": "And you will find traces of poison?",
  "45734": "Shall I begin, ma'am?",
  "45735": "Whither ?",
  "45736": "Do you not then know, child, how you can make the hyena gentle, and the tiger tame?",
  "45737": "Is it that you have almost all finished, or are you speaking always?",
  "45738": "How will it benefit?",
  "45739": "Whence proceeded the foregoing folly?",
  "45740": "Now what does the king wish?",
  "45741": "Had it been raining all evening?",
  "45742": "Is it possible that not one of all these men will notice me?",
  "45743": "Did you dust this bureau yesterday morning?",

  "46145": "What sweets are we going to have?",
  "46146": "Say you have not?",
  "46147": "Or, on the other hand, might it not be attracted to the great central source of light and heat, and be absorbed in it?",
  "46148": "But where shall we find him?",
  "46149": "S'pose they'd have me thar?",
  "46150": "What was that you said about seeing someone up there on top of the hill?",
  "46151": "And you will not take my advice?",
  "46152": "Had he resisted, and been overcome in the struggle?",
  "46153": "*Do you know the proverb?",
  "46154": "Won't somebody dance?",
  "46155": "Why was he able to stand in the place of the scarecrow, hidden by nothing but an old hat?",
  "46156": "Who would not have expected them to be insipid likenesses of each other?",
  "46157": "You don't object to him, little woman?",
  "46158": "What has he said to you?",
  "46159": "That is no business of yours either, is it?",
  "46160": "Wouldn't it be better to keep hens, and get bigger eggs?",
  "46161": "That I was so happy as I was?",
  "46162": "Which of us is happy in this world?",
  "46163": "Where do you think to go to?",
  "46164": "Why did he come in?",
  "46165": "How long before?",
  "46166": "Why will you ask him in terms that he does not comprehend?",
  "46167": "And shall I ever neglect her, or hurt her, or even forget to consider her?",
  "46168": "Well, how is he?",
  "46169": "Among the patrons, I suppose?",
  "46170": "What is thy name?",
  "46171": "Am I, then, so very revolting?",
  "46172": "Ought I to vanish?",
  "46173": "After they had been declaiming eight hundred years, had they made the world better than when they began?",
  "46174": "You have that in the house, I suppose?",
  "46175": "Where are you taking us to?",
  "46176": "Whither was he to flee from universal famine?",
  "46177": "And have you handed in the petition?",
  "46178": "I mean, are you going to stay on in your cottage?",
  "46179": "May I have the use of your skiff?",
  "46180": "Are you the knight who came every day to the festival, always in different colours, and who caught the three golden apples?",
  "46181": "What sin of mine could merit such a rod?",
  "46182": "Indeed?",
  "46183": "When shall we be there?",
  "46184": "And if they were able to converse with one another, would they not suppose that they were naming what was actually before them?",
  "46185": "Why don't we get married?",
  "46186": "What's your name, boy?",
  "46187": "Why does my blood rush into a hell of tumult at a few words?",
  "46188": "But you still know each other?",
  "46189": "But in what does a strong association between a word and an idea differ from a weak one?",
  "46190": "And wha will glove my hand?",
  "46191": "Do you wonder that I avow this to you?",
  "46192": "You like that better than all your playthings, eh?",
  "46193": "Yet why be afraid?",
  "46194": "Do you find any dazzling sensation before the eyes?",
  "46195": "It's the right one, I suppose?",
  "46196": "And why wonder at that?",
  "46197": "Why, what is a silhouette party?",
  "46198": "How do you mean, I too?",
  "46199": "What sort of a fatality, in short, is that which is contradicted every instant by the facts which take place within its bosom?",
  "46200": "And do you really love him quite well enough?",
  "46201": "You were not aware of any hurrying feet on the stair as you entered the outer door?",
  "46202": "But how did these women bear themselves amid toils so arduous?",
  "46203": "Volumnia, do I make myself intelligible?",
  "46204": "What ain't a dream?",
  "46205": "Is all the spilt wine swallowed?",
  "46206": "And where is that letter?",
  "46207": "What would become of his wife if he should be convicted?",
  "46208": "He who had ever been so good to her, why had he now failed her so grievously?",
  "46209": "Why do you torture me?",
  "46210": "You are great friends, eh, all together?",
  "46211": "Do you find any trouble or disquiet in your body by the importunate stings and pricklings of the flesh?",
  "46212": "What made your sons go to spring on my sons till my big son was killed by your children?",
  "46213": "Well, then, where do we dine?",
  "46214": "Mightn't I have a little drop of that stuff, just in a cup of coffee?",
  "46215": "Find we no cure for wounds?",
  "46216": "Where did you go?",
  "46217": "Ah, how would she feel then?",
  "46218": "Did he wear a vest?",
  "46219": "Now, do you honestly think they can?",
  "46220": "What is its breadth?",
  "46221": "It's a bad business, eh?",
  "46222": "Do you waltz?",
  "46223": "Have you no place you call a parlour?",
  "46224": "You never intended really to propose to go with me to the altar, and then make yourself rich by one great perjury?",
  "46225": "How could I?",
  "46226": "Are you content with yourself and with your life?",
  "46227": "And what does the author mean to do?",
  "46228": "Was it intentionally?",
  "46229": "May I ask your reason for such an insulting supposition, sir?",
  "46230": "What was the force of that army?",
  "46231": "But of what?",
  "46232": "Do you know where we are going?",
  "46233": "What's the use of it?",
  "46234": "What year?",
  "46235": "But, woe is me, wherefore do I complain?",
  "46236": "Have you a garden of your own?",
  "46237": "Why is not this principle universal?",
  "46238": "Can't you do it more gently?",
  "46239": "And was the sum a large one?",
  "46240": "Why, we are all mortal, are we not?",
  "46241": "Philip, how can you be so unkind?",
  "46242": "Where is he now?",
  "46243": "Will your majesty please proceed?",
  "46244": "And, besides, what is paying it but submission to tyranny?",
  "46245": "But why all this secrecy?",
  "46246": "Oh, gosh?",
  "46247": "Not much in the habit of such travelling yourself, I think, sir?",
  "46248": "But what's the matter with you?",
  "46249": "Besides, what could you have to tell me?",
  "46250": "You know that you are recalled to life?",
  "46251": "Will she be back soon?",
  "46252": "That wasn't right?",
  "46253": "Airing yourself, as I am doing, before you go to bed?",
  "46254": "And the sometime greater to the sometime less, and the greater that is to be to the less that is to be?",
  "46255": "Do you like that dining at the tables d'hote?",
  "46256": "Couldn't one get a book?",
  "46257": "Is the hand not always pointing there?",
  "46258": "Shouldn't they have been happy?",
  "46259": "But who was the spy who stole the papers?",
  "46260": "So it's 'Eat my dear birdies,' is it, young man?",
  "46261": "And yet the cardinal was attached to you?",
  "46262": "Can any woman alive believe you in earnest, or think you design anything but to banter her?",
  "46263": "But, such being the case, where could you have heard the same report?",
  "46264": "Why had he not told her everything?",
  "46265": "Who is that BRAHMA?",
  "46266": "What offence did I commit?",
  "46267": "Where am I to find them?",
  "46268": "What paper have you written for?",
  "46269": "How should the leman of a vassal become a king's wife?",
  "46270": "Where are you from?",
  "46271": "Is it he?",
  "46272": "And these other instruments, the use of which I cannot guess?",
  "46273": "She will pay, only when?",
  "46274": "Do you mean write it to her?",
  "46275": "How do you make that out?",
  "46276": "Russian books, indeed ?",
  "46277": "Will you walk in, sir?",
  "46278": "To whom then?",
  "46279": "You prefer to stay here and imagine that all the world is gaping at your pictures?",
  "46280": "What know I of the minister's heart?",
  "46281": "And why among us four?",
  "46282": "You were looking for me out of the window?",
  "46283": "Has he not already forgotten she ever existed?",
  "46284": "Is he not solid gold?",
  "46285": "What are their secret counsels?",
  "46286": "Who'll say a guinea?",
  "46287": "Do you think I particularly like you?",
  "46288": "Who is he, my dear?",
  "46289": "And did you?",
  "46290": "Shall I ever know any thing?",
  "46291": "Where is that murderer?",
  "46292": "Oh, is it broken?",
  "46293": "True, but saw you ever one more cool and assured?",
  "46294": "And is there no room for love there?",
  "46295": "For not alluding to your leaving us?",
  "46296": "What then must be the result?",
  "46297": "What is all settled?",
  "46298": "Saw you those meteors?",
  "46299": "And what will that good treatment be?",
  "46300": "Well, but is there any war on record which was carried on successfully by him, or aided by his counsels, when he was alive?",
  "46301": "Do you want a map?",
  "46302": "But what other is there?",
  "46303": "Say candidly, were not those heavenly black eyes the whole basis of all your early reasoning on the subject?",
  "46304": "You understand the rest, then?",
  "46305": "You couldn't sing a comic song on the pony's back, could you?",
  "46306": "Where were we?",
  "46307": "Would you have 'em both before marriage?",
  "46308": "Why was it?",
  "46309": "What made you choose that particular direction?",
  "46310": "Then the cost of this vessel is great?",
  "46311": "Socrates, has taken possession of you all?",
  "46312": "Have you seen for YOUR self?",
  "46313": "Bore me, my dear?",
  "46314": "How can I ever pay you?",
  "46315": "Give me one little sip more, and tell me from whom you received the noble gift?",
  "46316": "But the orders?",
  "46317": "How here?",
  "46318": "If I don't bring 'em here, what does it matter?",
  "46319": "Did he not, my dear father and mother, deserve all the truth to be told?",
  "46320": "You think that likely?",
  "46321": "Can we not better make the attempt after dark?",
  "46322": "Why don't you put the damned dabs into something that will stay, then?",
  "46323": "Carver, you DO think him witty?",
  "46324": "Don't you know your income?",
  "46325": "Giry?",
  "46326": "Why are they leaving the town?",
  "46327": "What is the meaning of that noise?",
  "46328": "And did you go alone?",
  "46329": "What good wind brings you here?",
  "46330": "And if he were dead, to what height of fury would not the violence of the people lash the legionaries?",
  "46331": "You see I am generous, am I not, mother?",
  "46332": "What charm has gone from the twilight?",
  "46333": "What is it, sir?",
  "46334": "And what brought you here?",
  "46335": "Could he have any, do you suppose?",
  "46336": "FOOD FOR THE VULTURES?",
  "46337": "Have you happened to miss such an article as a pie, blacksmith?",
  "46338": "Is it as nice as it sounds?",
  "46339": "You're no wiser than the rest of us, are you?",
  "46340": "Still dreaming and staring?",
  "46341": "How dare you say such things about me?",
  "46342": "Is it not true that legists are governed by caprice in giving and taking away rights?",
  "46343": "Will you go over and get some canned peaches?",
  "46344": "And you heard nothing, and saw nothing?",
  "46345": "When did he go to church last?",
  "46346": "Which then shall we prefer?",
  "46347": "What more inconstant than the desires of man?",
  "46348": "And you obeyed?",
  "46349": "Which should he take?",
  "46350": "What's the matter?",
  "46351": "Does it not make you shudder?",
  "46352": "What infernal noise?",
  "46353": "Jellyby's?",
  "46354": "Do any of you know of one?",
  "46355": "They did not, and why not?",
  "46356": "When do you leave town?",
  "46357": "He knows what YOU know?",
  "46358": "What are you bothering him for?",
  "46359": "What can it be?",
  "46360": "How, sir?",
  "46361": "You met him once at my place, don't you remember?",
  "46362": "Whom shall we call, lest spectres should appear?",
  "46363": "Differently?",
  "46364": "And how am I to cross?",
  "46365": "But what am I going to eat?",
  "46366": "How often am I to call you?",
  "46367": "Is it not a source of mortification to a class of men that they are excluded from political power?",
  "46368": "Do you see this parcel?",
  "46369": "A murder do you call it?",
  "46370": "Who does not love you?",
  "46371": "And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?",
  "46372": "How like you her wit?",
  "46373": "It's very soon done, sir, isn't it?",
  "46374": "Have you got anything of your own?",
  "46375": "But where are the folk?",
  "46376": "Can't you wait till that day comes?",
  "46377": "But shall I not use tobacco at all?",
  "46378": "Now, when the thing's done, don't you see, can one possibly cast her off?",
  "46379": "Will you never be done getting me into trouble?",
  "46380": "Françoise, all these young fellows not caring two straws for their lives?",
  "46381": "Why, tell me, said he, what answer you would make?",
  "46382": "What can be done with four?",
  "46383": "Was he not contented with his children?",
  "46384": "Can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws?",
  "46385": "You have nothing more to say?",
  "46386": "You told him that?",
  "46387": "Would you advise me, whilst able to fight, to throw the arms I hold in my hand to the ground?",
  "46388": "Now, what do you want with me?",
  "46389": "What are people planning against him?",
  "46390": "Forever a footman?",
  "46391": "But where are we, uncle?",
  "46392": "Wouldn't he be utterly foolish there?",
  "46393": "Who forced my hand, as was the lawful cap'n?",
  "46394": "Will your majesty do me the honor to explain yourself?",
  "46395": "Who could this young woman be, I wonder?",
  "46396": "The beginning of what?",
  "46397": "Who d'you work for?",
  "46398": "Why does the theatre draw me so that I am willing to sacrifice for it even those I love?",
  "46399": "Can you remember?",
  "46400": "What should ail them?",
  "46401": "But why should these rough drafts of letters be regarded as anything else than what they actually and obviously are?",
  "46402": "Why had he married the eyes in the photograph?",
  "46403": "Ned, my dear fellow, will you mention what we agreed upon?",
  "46404": "Do you know what that is?",
  "46405": "Couldn't do it?",
  "46406": "Was he satisfied?",
  "46407": "Have you been for a soldier?",
  "46408": "Where are the brothers?",
  "46409": "He whom your aunt intends for you?",
  "46410": "I was to leave town the next day for a fortnight's absence, and whom had they to see to them?",
  "46411": "What do I ask now?",
  "46412": "What shall we do for dessert?",
  "46413": "Who do you give your casting vote to?",
  "46414": "How is it that this difference happens?",
  "46415": "But do you only labour at the graves of children, and young people?",
  "46416": "What became of the two men?",
  "46417": "And has not the body itself less of truth and essence than the soul?",
  "46418": "Better?",
  "46419": "You came straight here?",
  "46420": "She did, hey?",
  "46421": "All of us?",
  "46422": "Shall we turn back, or run into a cottage?",
  "46423": "Why did his condition improve?",
  "46424": "How was it?",
  "46425": "Will they permit me to enter?",
  "46426": "And if it is not sorcery, what is it, then?",
  "46427": "Was she lying?",
  "46428": "Why do you kneel to me?",
  "46429": "Jane, are you ready?",
  "46430": "Then you suppose it was the people alone who wished to burn the condemned?",
  "46431": "Is it a strict moral obligation?",
  "46432": "I didn't know she was coming, did I?",
  "46433": "Isn't my safety worth a little sacrifice of dogmatic principle?",
  "46434": "Isn't it royal?",
  "46435": "Who came hither?",
  "46436": "How will you judge the counterfeit, if you have no guarantee?",
  "46437": "Damn it now, what's his name?",
  "46438": "And stealing yet more blessed than taking?",
  "46439": "Is there ony room at your feet?",
  "46440": "May I count on you?",
  "46441": "And where am I to sit?",
  "46442": "Where has she taken refuge?",
  "46443": "Why should I go to see them, therefore?",
  "46444": "Are there not the unjust who are fortunate, while the just are unfortunate?",
  "46445": "What would he think of me, of my lack of will?",
  "46446": "Is the imp altogether evil?",
  "46447": "In this new revolution thus established forever, who shall decide which is the sun and which is the moon?",
  "46448": "Of THEMSELVES?",
  "46449": "What are you saying to me?",
  "46450": "What is yonder?",
  "46451": "When did you lie, the last time or now?",
  "46452": "Did he live his life again in every detail of desire, temptation, and surrender during that supreme moment of complete knowledge?",
  "46453": "Did you see him?",
  "46454": "What prompted me then to disturb the memory of the buried dead?",
  "46455": "But can you really be so credulous as to think that I will print all this and give it to you to read too?",
  "46456": "How shall we destroy him?",
  "46457": "Am I not your mother also?",
  "46458": "Why didn't you bring her?",
  "46459": "And the bridegroom?",
  "46460": "What are young men to rocks and mountains?",
  "46461": "Wot did I say?",
  "46462": "I am her father, am I not?",
  "46463": "Going to be in town long?",
  "46464": "But when will that be?",
  "46465": "But what have I done to you?",
  "46466": "Yours is a long life to look back upon, sir?",
  "46467": "D'ye understand?",
  "46468": "Then it was you?",
  "46469": "Why have you come?",
  "46470": "And that we may dismiss you to the moor and the rainy night?",
  "46471": "Will it come off?",
  "46472": "Why is there so much negation and abnegation in your hearts?",
  "46473": "And is there any greater or keener pleasure than that of sensual love?",
  "46474": "You know the consequences of mixing them?",
  "46475": "When have I been hash, tell me?",
  "46476": "Did you think a gentleman would be likely to take any interest in you?",
  "46477": "But what reference has that to me?",
  "46478": "Couldn't you have sent her back?",
  "46479": "You were her first love?",
  "46480": "Who were they?",
  "46481": "Yet why a second venture try?",
  "46482": "Do you want him to be fond of you?",
  "46483": "Where would you go?",
  "46484": "What advantages had she?",
  "46485": "Well, how has all gone off?",
  "46486": "Do we pay no money?",
  "46487": "What weapon would he choose?",
  "46488": "Why did he not go on?",
  "46489": "What will you take for it?",
  "46490": "Anything for me?",
  "46491": "What is there more?",
  "46492": "Is your majesty satisfied to see the earl and the queen make their appearance at this meeting?",
  "46493": "What possessed you to tell those stories about my saddle, and the hats and boots, and all the rest of it?",
  "46494": "Perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him?",
  "46495": "Was I, then, not yet aware that what I felt, myself, for her, depended neither upon her actions nor upon my desires?",
  "46496": "Even as a man who rides a horse is called a horseman?",
  "46497": "Not to me, I hope?",
  "46498": "Has he any objection to make to them which would justify him in overturning them?",
  "46499": "A young gentleman, is he not?",
  "46500": "But have you reflected seriously?",
  "46501": "Is this your indifference, your uninteresting conversation?",
  "46502": "Then one may smoke on board?",
  "46503": "Why should not she be a maid of honor, as well as myself?",
  "46504": "What will come out of those three elements when I am no longer present to combine them?",
  "46505": "Stopping here?",
  "46506": "I needn't, but hadn't I better?",
  "46507": "Sed?",
  "46508": "Were not the slaves, thanks to the right of sanctuary and to their poverty, the dearest proteges of religion?",
  "46509": "Didn't you cheat at croquet?",
  "46510": "It appears then that the world judge correctly, why should you be ashamed of their favorable judgment?",
  "46511": "As princes of the blood, in fact?",
  "46512": "What, faithless?",
  "46513": "What else do you want?",
  "46514": "Has the loss of memory rendered it impossible for you to weep?",
  "46515": "May I help you off with your helmet?",
  "46516": "Why has she been crying?",
  "46517": "What can they have done with him?",
  "46518": "Do you love me, then?",
  "46519": "Blacklisted?",
  "46520": "Will they neither obey nor make room for those who will?",
  "46521": "At what point shall we expect the approach of danger?",
  "46522": "But shall not we, ourselves, the truth maintain?",
  "46523": "My dear, do you see?",
  "46524": "But, after all, what is this metaphor called a crown, or rather what is monarchy?",
  "46525": "Is the aggregate power of the general government greater than ought to have been vested in it?",
  "46526": "Do you doubt them?",
  "46527": "Would you take a creature that has not a groat in the world?",
  "46528": "And that other gentleman?",
  "46529": "What would your excellency like to eat?",
  "46530": "How much do a king git?",
  "46531": "How many times?",
  "46532": "Why should she not be his?",
  "46533": "It doesn't matter, does it?",
  "46534": "Why didn't you write, my dear, and say you were coming?",
  "46535": "How do you maintain discipline among your men?",
  "46536": "And are you going to have no breakfast or dinner today?",

  "46940": "Have you any means of transport?",
  "46941": "Why should you put things so bitterly, dearie?",
  "46942": "The millionaire's mite, eh?",
  "46943": "Will you direct me to a lawyer who will aid me?",
  "46944": "Are they real?",
  "46945": "And for what purpose?",
  "46946": "Do you suppose the boat will sail promptly?",
  "46947": "What was its standard?",
  "46948": "Do you remember how silent I was on the drive back?",
  "46949": "Besides, why were they not allowed to escape?",
  "46950": "Were we really there half an hour?",
  "46951": "Does that satisfy you?",
  "46952": "Won't you have something warm to drink?",
  "46953": "Do you see that, my dear?",
  "46954": "The circumstances?",
  "46955": "Would you imagine it?",
  "46956": "O, is't the custom?",
  "46957": "How many had I?",
  "46958": "What does he want me to do, I wonder?",
  "46959": "What, outside our line?",
  "46960": "Is this the way I must return to native dust?",
  "46961": "You think he has run away, do you, sir?",
  "46962": "That he should appear only at that point?",
  "46963": "What are you saying?",
  "46964": "Foolish indeed?",
  "46965": "Quite strong and well, I hope?",
  "46966": "Is his power of speech gone?",
  "46967": "Would he not have done better to have kept the water that he had decomposed in pure loss, in order to sustain him in the air?",
  "46968": "And he might have asked also, where the industry so necessary for such a trade?",
  "46969": "But if I justify it?",
  "46970": "Was he so awfully hot?",
  "46971": "Isn't that your tobacco lying there?",
  "46972": "What is thy name, fellow?",
  "46973": "Where she would be settled?",
  "46974": "Has madame come in yet?",
  "46975": "And which I can have?",
  "46976": "For who would understand the work within him?",
  "46977": "The spider?",
  "46978": "Haven't I told you I won't give them up?",
  "46979": "Where can we be going in such a tiny pool of water?",
  "46980": "Had you heard that?",
  "46981": "But what then, made her so unhappy?",
  "46982": "No brother at all?",
  "46983": "The question I have to ask myself is, shall I marry him?",
  "46984": "Have you been dragging the river all day, gentlemen?",
  "46985": "Perhaps two o'clock will suit you better?",
  "46986": "Anyone in the room could get out?",
  "46987": "A dream?",
  "46988": "And his eminence, the cardinal?",
  "46989": "Did you answer it yourself?",
  "46990": "Put 'em ashore like maroons?",
  "46991": "And what does she come worming herself in here for?",
  "46992": "What comes next?",
  "46993": "This prisoner, who was he?",
  "46994": "Do you recollect me?",
  "46995": "The lieutenant of musketeers?",
  "46996": "And you don't think the patient would object to him?",
  "46997": "You wish to be, according to your tastes or private friendships, free to destroy my plans and save my enemies?",
  "46998": "If I be right in this, how could we make any entirely new improvement by means of tonnage duties?",
  "46999": "Wherein differ the sea and the land, that a miracle upon one is not a miracle upon the other?",
  "47000": "Will you leave that spinning wheel be, you young devils?",
  "47001": "You're wretched, he's wretched, and what good can come of it?",
  "47002": "You have received a regular letter of advice?",
  "47003": "What was that awful noise?",
  "47004": "I asked him where he meant to go?",
  "47005": "And light of foot?",
  "47006": "Do you feel unwell?",
  "47007": "What is a fontis?",
  "47008": "And will not their wives be the best women?",
  "47009": "How, then, did you deduce the telegram?",
  "47010": "Which of them, seeing us together here, will believe that our meeting and dancing at the gipsy party was by chance?",
  "47011": "Why should not my father see him?",
  "47012": "I have heard a party was to leave the encampment this morning for the lake shore?",
  "47013": "What do you call important?",
  "47014": "And, really, what is the result of all this?",
  "47015": "Beg him to come at once, do you hear?",
  "47016": "What do you do in your cottage when it rains like this?",
  "47017": "If so, what we are afraid of, when we but suspect our enemies will inflict it on us, shall we inflict it on ourselves for certain?",
  "47018": "But where are you going really?",
  "47019": "Did not the sun shine upon him with a halo, so that he was bright as an angel?",
  "47020": "No dinner?",
  "47021": "How much does the proprietor increase the utility of his tenant's products?",
  "47022": "You've never worked at anything like this before, have you?",
  "47023": "Did you see us?",
  "47024": "But who could ever repay half the debt we owe you?",
  "47025": "Could he have thrown down the statue after he'd stripped the corpse?",
  "47026": "Shall we say in one hour's time?",
  "47027": "First of all, what did you see?",
  "47028": "Why, where ever did you go?",
  "47029": "You mean the rascals?",
  "47030": "Is it really calling us?",
  "47031": "Do they not think, they will have their own ends, and be truer to themselves, than to them?",
  "47032": "What humour's this?",
  "47033": "How about when you lose?",
  "47034": "But how about the new orbit in which we are moving?",
  "47035": "Shall I lead the way?",
  "47036": "Where was the poor devil to go?",
  "47037": "Would they not willingly sacrifice a little gift in order to obtain everlasting life?",
  "47038": "Where else could he have put it?",
  "47039": "Won't, if he has the chance, turn on me?",
  "47040": "Why are you explaining?",
  "47041": "Why how do you know?",
  "47042": "Well, did he?",
  "47043": "What the deuce have you done with yourself this last month?",
  "47044": "How much have you left of your hundred pistoles, d'Artagnan?",
  "47045": "Why should we load ourselves with a useless burden?",
  "47046": "Had he, beneath the childish face, already recognized the passionate, proud woman?",
  "47047": "What is the reward?",
  "47048": "Why, why, why, are there no harbours of refuge for grown men who have not yet lost them?",
  "47049": "To what good?",
  "47050": "Do you know why I came clear out here afoot?",
  "47051": "Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?",
  "47052": "Is he dead?",
  "47053": "Look here, captain, to speak candidly, do you mean to say that there is anything marvelous in the occurrence?",
  "47054": "What was his purpose?",
  "47055": "There were brave men among them, but of what use was courage when their weapons were powerless against the monster?",
  "47056": "Have you any witness on't?",
  "47057": "Is it a bargain?",
  "47058": "And in the common way of his business does he not expect to be paid for his pictures?",
  "47059": "Who is this youth?",
  "47060": "Not named?",
  "47061": "He hain't been a sittin' so all day, has he?",
  "47062": "And where is your young master?",
  "47063": "How can we truly open the doors, and set free the full genius of our people?",
  "47064": "This what?",
  "47065": "We will go up now, shall we?",
  "47066": "But, it will be asked again, can we on these grounds, admit the existence of a wise and omnipotent author of the world?",
  "47067": "You have taken them away?",
  "47068": "He wondered if she would pity him if she knew?",
  "47069": "Save it?",
  "47070": "To do with you, my lord?",
  "47071": "Our course is barred southward?",
  "47072": "What boots it to deplore?",
  "47073": "How do you manage yours?",
  "47074": "What other dreadful things may happen, who can tell?",
  "47075": "How now, what noise is that?",
  "47076": "What is that house, then?",
  "47077": "Did he cut you out?",
  "47078": "You want to know the crime of which you are accused?",
  "47079": "How could we both be deceived?",
  "47080": "How was her girl to have guarded herself from a love so unfortunate, or have avoided the rock on which her vessel had been shipwrecked?",
  "47081": "Do you notice anything about the arrangement of the lamps?",
  "47082": "Can it establish a maximum?",
  "47083": "You take a roundabout way, then, to inform me that I am very ill?",
  "47084": "Shall I myself really have to say it to him?",
  "47085": "What other case?",
  "47086": "Is there any news of game afoot?",
  "47087": "What does it matter to you?",
  "47088": "Surprised you, didn't I?",
  "47089": "Nice animal for a pleasure party, wasn't it?",
  "47090": "How much is so applied?",
  "47091": "Why do I find it so hard to breathe?",
  "47092": "Ye must tell us more, whether our dear friends at home be of good cheer?",
  "47093": "Did you find poison, or a dagger, that you look so mournful now?",
  "47094": "What do you think of that plan?",
  "47095": "Do you not feel that?",
  "47096": "Besides, are they worse than others, these whom you call savages?",
  "47097": "You believe, then, the attack will be renewed?",
  "47098": "But why should you?",
  "47099": "What was this grand, eternal pageant to which he had yearned from his childhood up, and in which he could never take part?",
  "47100": "Will nothing alter your decision?",
  "47101": "Were you hit?",
  "47102": "Can you tell me anything about the matter?",
  "47103": "Where did you meet him?",
  "47104": "By what constraint doth the high stoop to the low?",
  "47105": "What was it that opened it?",
  "47106": "And what have we to oppose to them?",
  "47107": "I suppose you work till late?",
  "47108": "Murdered?",
  "47109": "Can ye restore to us the beloved dead?",
  "47110": "Shall my silly heart be pined 'Cause I see a woman kind?",
  "47111": "Suppose he never commits the crime?",
  "47112": "So you knew me all the time, from the first moment I came into the room?",
  "47113": "From what, they asked, could his dissatisfaction arise?",
  "47114": "Is this arrangement satisfactory?",
  "47115": "Are you well?",
  "47116": "Couldn't you and I camp out in this house for the night?",
  "47117": "Where are you speaking from?",
  "47118": "What need to say that?",
  "47119": "What eye could penetrate into the tower of darkness?",
  "47120": "Has the ministry resigned?",
  "47121": "Am I not ready speak de too moshe?",
  "47122": "But how shall we gain the bottom of the sea?",
  "47123": "But suppose they come unarmed?",
  "47124": "But what was she doing?",
  "47125": "Was it from the cold?",
  "47126": "You will not, eh?",
  "47127": "Where should we be going, but home?",
  "47128": "Going home?",
  "47129": "But even apart from that?",
  "47130": "He won't, won't he?",
  "47131": "How is it, then?",
  "47132": "It would be terrible if we all yielded to it, wouldn't it?",
  "47133": "Of what consequence was this to them?",
  "47134": "What do they matter to you?",
  "47135": "And the work?",
  "47136": "How can you act this way, dearest?",
  "47137": "What other matters?",
  "47138": "Do you hear?",
  "47139": "How is it that a fatal organization, the organization of humanity, is adventitious, contradictory, full of tumult and catastrophes?",
  "47140": "Shall we not know it?",
  "47141": "What, indeed?",
  "47142": "Guilty?",
  "47143": "What, he had done you the honor to remain here?",
  "47144": "How shall you all fear death if you all know what your friend does not know that he knows?",
  "47145": "Who is that?",
  "47146": "And how long can he rest at the end of his journey?",
  "47147": "You were trying to guess that?",
  "47148": "Cannot you go to the river and drink your fill from the stream?",
  "47149": "Why on earth should two men write a letter in such a fashion?",
  "47150": "Wilfully?",
  "47151": "How long have you been here?",
  "47152": "Or stars and strings?",
  "47153": "An't you?",
  "47154": "Why can't I die now?",
  "47155": "You do not?",
  "47156": "Who could fully describe even five minutes of it?",
  "47157": "You want to take my father FROM me?",
  "47158": "Why should I refuse her whom I bear in heart?",
  "47159": "Who's a child?",
  "47160": "How can I possibly treat these poor fellows, who are of some good, at all events, otherwise than as a councilor of parliament?",
  "47161": "And how about a tour abroad?",
  "47162": "Are you mad, you wretch?",
  "47163": "And what is his rank and proper name?",
  "47164": "But can we expect such a king, or, for that is the material point, can we expect a lineal series of such kings?",
  "47165": "How did you get such a huge huge head?",
  "47166": "Was I resigned?",
  "47167": "And you think if I marry, it will be snub?",
  "47168": "Their complexion?",
  "47169": "I will be?",
  "47170": "A good cause might turn the scale with me, for may not I too be of an exceptional brain, congenitally?",
  "47171": "Is there anything you hold sacred?",
  "47172": "What did you take then at any other?",
  "47173": "Were there many of them?",
  "47174": "How did you escape?",
  "47175": "Will you now comply with my request?",
  "47176": "And the world, you think, would be none the poorer?",
  "47177": "You don't mind admitting that, I suppose?",
  "47178": "Who can tell them where their father is?",
  "47179": "For how is it probable that he would have been tender of his life, when he was so bitter against his memory?",
  "47180": "And why didn't mamma speak to me about him?",
  "47181": "Is it to be some panel of philosophers, some fancied posterity, or some other outside authority?",
  "47182": "Could he not feel that letters, eloquence, philosophy, were all degraded in his degradation?",
  "47183": "Got a cigaroot?",
  "47184": "In love with me?",
  "47185": "What is it, then?",
  "47186": "Some good fortune?",
  "47187": "And meantime?",
  "47188": "But am I not too cold with him?",
  "47189": "Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a lie?",
  "47190": "When do you cease to work?",
  "47191": "Following me?",
  "47192": "What do you here, fellows?",
  "47193": "How will you group the words together according to your new interpretation?",
  "47194": "So much frankness, do you say?",
  "47195": "A big P with a flourish above it, E and N smaller?",
  "47196": "Have you anything to add?",
  "47197": "Yet, after all, who would not envy him?",
  "47198": "Do you?",
  "47199": "Did he still need her, or she him?",
  "47200": "What will it be when he has grown up?",
  "47201": "What am I to do with a stone?",
  "47202": "He was wrong, then?",
  "47203": "But will you let me speak a word or two with you in private?",
  "47204": "When, how, and by what title did they obtain this privilege?",
  "47205": "Morrel?",
  "47206": "What is it you call him?",
  "47207": "Could it ever be?",
  "47208": "Would he be so lost to propriety as to marry her before the year was out?",
  "47209": "Do they think we're dogs?",
  "47210": "Did you redress yourself to me, my man?",
  "47211": "Yes, she loved him, or else how could that have happened which had happened?",
  "47212": "Does not the cone of the shadow cast by the earth extend beyond the moon?",
  "47213": "And must it not be looked upon as a sort of warrant for such actions, if I stay after this?",
  "47214": "Isn't it all the same?",
  "47215": "Would he say dat?",
  "47216": "Was it not wrong?",
  "47217": "You think, then, that I may rely on the count's promises?",
  "47218": "Mamma, why shouldn't father come with us?",
  "47219": "At your house?",
  "47220": "He was awfully rich, wasn't he, mother?",
  "47221": "Had he, indeed, been permitted to see a satyr at home?",
  "47222": "In search of what?",
  "47223": "I have no doubt of it, but are these your only reasons for this sudden fancy?",
  "47224": "Do you recognize me at all?",
  "47225": "Expected?",
  "47226": "And in the meanwhile?",
  "47227": "Why did you shake your head?",
  "47228": "Wouldn't you like to go to such a beautiful city as that when you die?",
  "47229": "And what good can you do her?",
  "47230": "Who is there?",
  "47231": "And to what part of it?",
  "47232": "She said she was not your wife?",
  "47233": "Can't you understand why?",
  "47234": "How are you going to get him down?",
  "47235": "And these things I see suddenly, what mean they?",
  "47236": "How dared you?",
  "47237": "Why did she not let me know sooner?",
  "47238": "Because of the numerous court decisions of that character?",
  "47239": "You are a hypocrite, too, are you?",
  "47240": "Then why should this be so?",
  "47241": "Could he not escape from his little house?",
  "47242": "And is it finished?",
  "47243": "Quoy de ceux qui naturellement se changent en loups, en juments, et puis encores en hommes?",
  "47244": "Who comes here?",
  "47245": "And your police?",
  "47246": "Isn't it fun?",
  "47247": "What signified that disguise?",
  "47248": "But the grave question was, ought she to do this?",
  "47249": "What are you up to?",
  "47250": "What word, then, can be found to describe the days which they occupy in descending?",
  "47251": "Well, and is that all?",
  "47252": "Our hero commanded the galley?",
  "47253": "Then you do not fear to follow?",
  "47254": "ESPANOL?",
  "47255": "Is this one of the nine comforts of matrimony?",
  "47256": "And who made him my master?",
  "47257": "And how will you do that?",
  "47258": "Why should it?",
  "47259": "But what then?",
  "47260": "What envy would hinder him?",
  "47261": "Danglars?",
  "47262": "Your husband isn't in the house, I suppose?",
  "47263": "The death of your prince?",
  "47264": "Whither should I ride but to the court?",
  "47265": "And the flies?",
  "47266": "From ME?",
  "47267": "Does not his appearance speak for him?",
  "47268": "What is it, then?",
  "47269": "Who'll get there first?",
  "47270": "Was cupidity, strengthened by habit, to be laid asleep by a few fine sentences about virtue and union?",
  "47271": "But you will be careful, won't you?",
  "47272": "Nothing, aunt?",
  "47273": "Isn't it lucky we found it?",
  "47274": "Then why harm anyone?",
  "47275": "The good of mankind?",
  "47276": "Am I pale?",
  "47277": "Does he resemble either of these two passengers?",
  "47278": "But the work?",
  "47279": "But those who see the absolute and eternal and immutable may be said to know, and not to have opinion only?",
  "47280": "Does the reasoning strike yo as being faulty?",
  "47281": "Or perhaps you may be intending to undertake some sort of employment?",
  "47282": "Regiment cut up rough, think you?",
  "47283": "Were they asked?",
  "47284": "Francois?",
  "47285": "Then you've come from my house, have you?",
  "47286": "Who is that secret lover, I ask, of whom, at least, most of the relatives know nothing?",
  "47287": "Where is the gentleman to whom you are engaged?",
  "47288": "Didn't I tell you that?",
  "47289": "I suppose you remember him?",
  "47290": "What reparation can you make for this?",
  "47291": "Which has happened to you?",
  "47292": "What is democracy?",
  "47293": "Nor hear, nor regard ourselves?",
  "47294": "Are you in good spirits?",
  "47295": "Can it then be a matter of surprise, that boys become selfish and vicious who are thus shut out from social converse?",
  "47296": "Of nostril clear?",
  "47297": "Do you expect company?",
  "47298": "How often am I to say the same thing?",
  "47299": "As for themselves, what can they depend on in this their opposition, when the greatest part of their city is already taken?",
  "47300": "How can you leave us?",
  "47301": "And your mother?",
  "47302": "Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive?",
  "47303": "Of what nation be they, and of what kindred?",
  "47304": "What's that cry?",
  "47305": "But what I want to know, mister, is how the coppers know these things?",
  "47306": "But if, uneasy at our absence, he would venture to come?",
  "47307": "Did you tell him that it was the last door at the end of the corridor, on the right?",
  "47308": "How could I come till I knew what had befallen you?",
  "47309": "What place is that, the falcon?",
  "47310": "Ye say it is the good cause which halloweth even war?",
  "47311": "Did ye ever see the like of that cloud?",
  "47312": "What's going on now?",
  "47313": "You had been drinking as well as begging last night, had you not?",
  "47314": "There, will you let me go?",
  "47315": "Next, if her present servant love her?",
  "47316": "Does he say it in his general sweeping charge?",
  "47317": "And in what manner ought it to attend to them ?",
  "47318": "So, old acquaintance, said my master, again have I met you in this place?",
  "47319": "How can I explain myself?",
  "47320": "Have we lost faith?",
  "47321": "Don't you think it may be a little premature?",
  "47322": "Why did I do it?",
  "47323": "But why do you think we shall be safe?",
  "47324": "What then remains?",
  "47325": "Ought I to spare myself more than others?",
  "47326": "Is she faithful to him?",
  "47327": "All day?",
  "47328": "Come now, that comical joke?",
  "47329": "What have ye done to surpass man?",
  "47330": "Why should I witness embarrassments which I cannot relieve, and mysteries which I offend you even by attempting to penetrate?",
  "47331": "Will we ourselves be at peace?",
  "47332": "Why was it so?",
  "47333": "Who gave them a right to decide that it is a sin?",
  "47334": "Will you go, dearest?",

  "47836": "Do I not know that, all the country round, men and woman are calling me the same behind my back?",
  "47837": "Who are these people on the side of the bill?",
  "47838": "But what is it, then?",
  "47839": "But who, then was this man?",
  "47840": "Then they do not know it yet?",
  "47841": "What if he turned his back, now, and disappeared mysteriously?",
  "47842": "You won't hold that noise, won't you?",

  "47876": "Look, will this insolence amend thy lot?",
  "47877": "Who may the four be?",
  "47878": "Do I look as if I liked it?",
  "47879": "Well, is it good?",
  "47880": "Then a man may feel for years that he is good solid company, and be wrong about himself after all?",
  "47881": "Did I say you wasn't beautiful?",
  "47882": "Are we only half way up?",
  "47883": "Pray, when, sir, shall I see you at my house?",
  "47884": "But when is this ball to take place?",

  "48518": "Isn't it just the same?",
  "48519": "Could you swear to it?",
  "48520": "What, do you confess, then?",
  "48521": "Is that bill real?",
  "48522": "You wouldn't then?",
  "48523": "Then where is the butter jar?",
  "48524": "Do you believe me?",
  "48525": "What can I do to save you?",
  "48526": "And what if they are?",
  "48527": "Has he recognized me?",
  "48528": "Do you hear what he says?",
  "48529": "You want to go to your uncle?",
  "48530": "Do you begin, a little, to be satisfied?",
  "48531": "What's come to your lead?",
  "48532": "Am I that?",
  "48533": "Well, my dear fellow, so you still want to be an adjutant?",
  "48534": "Maybe you could get something in the stage line?",
  "48535": "You don't mean to tell me that you were expecting it?",
  "48536": "How much is the bottle?",
  "48537": "Who are those people?",
  "48538": "Come, who is my father?",
  "48539": "Why this interest?",
  "48540": "And what answer did you get?",
  "48541": "Will you kindly gif me a word of taste and help?",
  "48542": "Will you do that?",
  "48543": "Is it so?",
  "48544": "You remember the hat beside the dead man?",
  "48545": "What shall we do now, my son?",
  "48546": "You are referring to the demands of the rebels and to the tone in which they stated them?",
  "48547": "Now, really, let me ask, sir, have you?",
  "48548": "But, in admitting that the sun does not go out, might it not happen that the earth might move away from it?",
  "48549": "Do you mean where have I been while supper was getting ready?",
  "48550": "So, you will go?",
  "48551": "What's that writing about, eh?",
  "48552": "What chance brings you here, gentlemen?",
  "48553": "And, when so weighed, were they ever to kick the beam like feathers?",
  "48554": "What would he with vs?",
  "48555": "Would they soon be coming?",
  "48556": "Will you allow no affection, no love on my side, where there has been so much on your side?",
  "48557": "You, you poor creature, what good would you do?",
  "48558": "How will he live?",
  "48559": "Have you weaned her yet?",
  "48560": "Hain't your folk gone yet?",
  "48561": "Is there still no end to the bloodshed?",
  "48562": "Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up to the grand northern lights?",
  "48563": "Do you believe there is a consideration in the world that would induce her to take such a step against her favourite son?",
  "48564": "What is he looking at?",
  "48565": "But was not her father the head of the community?",
  "48566": "How could you be so careless?",
  "48567": "What are we to do?",
  "48568": "How is your life in danger here?",
  "48569": "Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?",
  "48570": "Again, upon the supposition that the soul is a harmony, why is one soul better than another?",
  "48571": "How did I deserve such pay?",
  "48572": "Where did he get out?",
  "48573": "Never mind, you know when monsieur le comte will return, at least?",
  "48574": "What was passing in that receptive childlike soul that so eagerly caught and assimilated all the diverse impressions of life?",
  "48575": "Which is which?",
  "48576": "I have been betrayed or denounced, then?",
  "48577": "Andy, where's your gun?",
  "48578": "So much as that?",
  "48579": "And have whole streams of blood been spilt in vain?",
  "48580": "But what is there to say about me?",
  "48581": "How were we going to begin to bring order out of this chaos?",
  "48582": "Do you recognize the carriage?",
  "48583": "Have ye understood this word, O my brethren?",
  "48584": "Why was she stumbling about amongst the rubble and catching her dress in brambles and burrs?",
  "48585": "Which driver was going to drive the carriage and which the cart?",
  "48586": "Who has clothed the earth in its beauty?",
  "48587": "Who a cuss cares what he knows?",
  "48588": "Zakhar is shouting that I should turn to the left, but why to the left?",
  "48589": "You believe in nothing visible, except grass and birds?",
  "48590": "But that column of water?",
  "48591": "How did you know it was the country?",
  "48592": "Were you comfortable together?",
  "48593": "May I stay a little longer?",
  "48594": "Will you become a suitor to her for her hand?",
  "48595": "What, to marry in an inn, and at night too?",
  "48596": "Well, where are we to go to now, father?",
  "48597": "Would you do me the favor of stepping into the shop?",
  "48598": "You see the stairs afore you?",
  "48599": "What will your relatives say to see me in a crumpled collar?",
  "48600": "To READ?",
  "48601": "The empty one?",
  "48602": "Where shall we meet again?",
  "48603": "Anyways, your reverence will call for me coming back?",
  "48604": "The earth?",
  "48605": "What unforseen events might not open his prison door, and restore him to liberty?",
  "48606": "Why will you have nothing to do with me?",
  "48607": "Why abridge our native freedom, when, in every instance, the utmost exertion of it is found innocent and beneficial?",
  "48608": "Was it prudence?",
  "48609": "Well, sir, what can I do?",
  "48610": "But where to now?",
  "48611": "Aramis here?",
  "48612": "How can you imagine it, since he has so lately declined everything from you?",
  "48613": "And what for?",
  "48614": "There's no likelihood of her running away or eloping?",
  "48615": "But who can see her as I have seen, who can know what her life has been, and not love her?",
  "48616": "Don't you keep track of them any more?",
  "48617": "Do you think any hint has reached her?",
  "48618": "Was that real or not?",
  "48619": "And will any duchess or countess rank with her?",
  "48620": "Well, if I didn't I suppose I shouldn't be here, should I?",
  "48621": "You are keeping the school there again, just as formerly?",
  "48622": "Don't you like hiding the garden?",
  "48623": "Worked here before?",
  "48624": "Peggotty go away from you?",
  "48625": "And in the sun?",
  "48626": "Have you not?",
  "48627": "Which field?",
  "48628": "How dare you trespass?",
  "48629": "What do you do in the circus?",
  "48630": "How could I understand all human affairs, ancient and modern, in the world?",
  "48631": "What is the good of your stars and trees, your sunrise and the wind, if they do not enter into our daily lives?",
  "48632": "My dear boys, what are you thinking about?",
  "48633": "I asked you if you knew him?",
  "48634": "What was it?",
  "48635": "And what of the country's people?",
  "48636": "And will you allow me the privilege of an old friend, of looking in upon you now and then?",
  "48637": "But do you believe you could arrest the progress of two horses rushing forwards with ungovernable fury?",
  "48638": "Stop, you wicked man, why did you look into the forbidden room?",
  "48639": "Has he lost his wealth at sea?",
  "48640": "Mercedes?",
  "48641": "Who told you that, my dear?",
  "48642": "How could one not love him?",
  "48643": "But you had a decent passage out, hadn't you?",
  "48644": "Silent still?",
  "48645": "Are they being killed, then?",
  "48646": "Was it actually in the room?",
  "48647": "But on which side is truth?",
  "48648": "Would it not have been better that we should remain friends?",
  "48649": "But how can we follow him?",
  "48650": "Do you mean to state what your complaint against this boy is, man, or do you not?",
  "48651": "Now what?",
  "48652": "What did he see?",
  "48653": "Is it not the rushing of the wolves you have mentioned?",
  "48654": "For what?",
  "48655": "Should he impose his galleys on those two dazzling children, or should he consummate his irremediable engulfment by himself?",
  "48656": "Did you bring it to your master directly it was made?",
  "48657": "Where do you hide 'em?",
  "48658": "Now I wonder where these blacks are?",
  "48659": "What mercies or what sins of men are you talking of?",
  "48660": "Do you require the word?",
  "48661": "Must I be disarmed, and hindered from using my own reason?",
  "48662": "What place and what season can be goodlier than this?",
  "48663": "To what do you allude, monsieur?",
  "48664": "Poor fellow, what is it?",
  "48665": "Liver out of order?",
  "48666": "After what they had seen, could the travelers solve it?",
  "48667": "And don't that give you a little uneasiness?",
  "48668": "Did I think them stupid, obscure, inexact?",
  "48669": "Quis vatum discursus erat?",
  "48670": "What were they all?",
  "48671": "Have you been, or are you, his mistress?",
  "48672": "And why did you behave thus about my portrait?",
  "48673": "And how for that?",
  "48674": "She said not, but who could tell what was truth which came from those lips, or if that corrupt heart was in this case pure?",
  "48675": "Have you heard the news?",
  "48676": "And we like 'em all the better for it, don't we?",
  "48677": "Will you kindly tell us which way your mother went to get on top the earth?",
  "48678": "Is that what you have made of him?",
  "48679": "It feels nervous and strange to be coming here again after all these years?",
  "48680": "Who was she that he danced with?",
  "48681": "How many persons is the prison built to hold?",
  "48682": "But what can he do?",
  "48683": "And what are those words THERE, on THAT line?",
  "48684": "Is that really you?",
  "48685": "How'd they act?",
  "48686": "Are these the picked bones of the little angel who has been cruelly devoured by the monster?",
  "48687": "Has it come to pass that you have buried yourself entirely?",
  "48688": "Won't he drown?",
  "48689": "How is it pointing?",
  "48690": "Change places with him, and would you have been looked at by those blue eyes as he was, and commiserated by that agitated face as he was?",
  "48691": "Is that your conclusion, lieutenant?",
  "48692": "What qualities have you, my friend, which would make your services so valuable?",
  "48693": "And may we not say the same of all things?",
  "48694": "And then if we look at things from a still more lofty point of view, why do we speak of civil war?",
  "48695": "Is it to tell the maids to leave their master's business and cook dinner for them?",
  "48696": "D'ye think I'm ashamed of my own name?",
  "48697": "Where did her dignity come from?",
  "48698": "Do you know what the question is here?",
  "48699": "Why, what harm was there in that?",
  "48700": "Do you really mean you had ever rented it?",
  "48701": "You will let me know?",
  "48702": "Is commerce of importance to national wealth?",
  "48703": "Who cares a button for our national ideas, any more than for our national bowler hat?",
  "48704": "How came it that they had discovered my flight so soon since it could not be more than six o'clock, if as much?",
  "48705": "Out of pure lightness of heart?",
  "48706": "For what is it you're wanting him, my poor man?",
  "48707": "You hear her?",
  "48708": "Whence came he?",
  "48709": "Are you mad, to talk to me thus?",
  "48710": "How is it that from beauty I have derived a type of unloveliness?",
  "48711": "Why shouldn't I get up and try that chair of yours?",
  "48712": "Does his island produce him such a revenue?",
  "48713": "Can he give any definition of it, that will not be the same with that of causation?",
  "48714": "For two good names, hey?",
  "48715": "Another round?",
  "48716": "What did he write it with?",
  "48717": "Whom have you got o' board?",
  "48718": "What are you up to now?",
  "48719": "What do I think?",
  "48720": "Why's that?",
  "48721": "Who, condemns justice and humanity in the abstract?",
  "48722": "Who asked you to try to persuade me to marry him?",
  "48723": "But what was the nature of this emotion?",
  "48724": "War?",
  "48725": "For if he be capable of attending his brother to the mount, why is he not made prefect of the city?",
  "48726": "Where is he to go?",
  "48727": "Where will you be with the grammars?",
  "48728": "Do you want to make out that you love them BOTH?",
  "48729": "Et ubi prenus?",
  "48730": "Must I do that?",
  "48731": "How is that all too brief period spent at present?",
  "48732": "What do we here?",
  "48733": "Been back long?",
  "48734": "Lyon?",
  "48735": "Why, what?",
  "48736": "What more is to be said?",
  "48737": "You would, would you?",
  "48738": "What do you mean by special privileges?",
  "48739": "How shall I dare to come, who know no good thing of myself, whence I might be able to presume?",
  "48740": "And pray, what sort of a road may that be?",
  "48741": "I?",
  "48742": "And what do those girls do?",
  "48743": "Now did I say anything of the sort?",
  "48744": "Why should I spare him?",
  "48745": "But how can the steersman follow the route in the middle of the waters?",
  "48746": "Go long, will ye?",
  "48747": "How do you feel now, ma'am?",
  "48748": "In a moment?",
  "48749": "What force made men act so?",
  "48750": "Do you mean, for example, that he who is mistaken about the sick is a physician in that he is mistaken?",
  "48751": "What would happen in the desolate darkness?",
  "48752": "You don't remember hittin' anything when you fell over, do you?",
  "48753": "A venial, or a mortal, sin?",
  "48754": "Who's to doom, when the judge himself is dragged to the bar?",
  "48755": "And that is all?",
  "48756": "Is that the lad?",
  "48757": "Well, how could that injure me, abbe?",
  "48758": "You'll stay to tea?",
  "48759": "How is it that the more easily I can be taxed the sooner I shall be provided?",
  "48760": "Nothing more?",
  "48761": "Will you not take a chair nearer to the fire?",
  "48762": "But what signifies it all?",
  "48763": "Who shot him, then?",
  "48764": "And if they be, what then?",
  "48765": "What do you intend doing with me?",
  "48766": "What has he done?",
  "48767": "The king?",
  "48768": "Shall we restore the dollar to its former gold content?",
  "48769": "Did you know about it?",
  "48770": "Did you do that?",
  "48771": "Don't they holler out a good deal, and scratch sometimes?",
  "48772": "Is there not?",
  "48773": "When did you first feel that?",
  "48774": "You have not dined?",
  "48775": "Am I ill?",
  "48776": "Was not this perhaps why he became an artillery officer?",
  "48777": "Will you go away and never molest her further?",
  "48778": "Will he not come out, think you?",
  "48779": "Could the finger prints of an ape be detected from those of a man?",
  "48780": "Why did you drop out of the league class after the first lesson?",
  "48781": "How can I do it?",
  "48782": "Is it above us, tell me, or below?",
  "48783": "What other means could I employ?",
  "48784": "But what did you want?",
  "48785": "On what occasion, ever, had she appeared to find him wanting?",
  "48786": "Where have you been all the time?",
  "48787": "And does the girl like you?",
  "48788": "Perhaps some cave, which it would be advisable to explore, existed there?",
  "48789": "What is your age?",
  "48790": "Would she not have made an admirable queen?",
  "48791": "Why should she defer the answer?",
  "48792": "And you have no doubt that it is your husband's hand, madam?",
  "48793": "He does?",
  "48794": "You, who have arranged your infernal plans, and removed the beverages with a talent and precision almost miraculous?",
  "48795": "Surely you must feel how easy it is for you to insult me?",
  "48796": "My name?",
  "48797": "Where's the policeman?",
  "48798": "Doesn't it destroy all our spontaneity, all our instincts?",
  "48799": "But is he sure that his son is dead?",
  "48800": "A pipe, then?",
  "48801": "Would they decide for or against it?",
  "48802": "Not finally?",
  "48803": "You will, of course, ask 'where is the connexion?",
  "48804": "Fail I alone, in words and deeds?",
  "48805": "For if they cannot, what possibly can become of them?",
  "48806": "Have I not told you that was my business?",
  "48807": "What a gentleman he is, isn't he?",
  "48808": "But what would you have in place of it?",
  "48809": "So that is the fate in store for us?",
  "48810": "What would your poor father say?",
  "48811": "What's the matter here, my dear?",
  "48812": "What shall I do now?",
  "48813": "Ask' you?",
  "48814": "Has he gone off?",
  "48815": "What is her name?",
  "48816": "What would you have here?",
  "48817": "Why came they to see me with such an equipage?",
  "48818": "What on earth are you talking about?",
  "48819": "Where do you suppose they all go to?",
  "48820": "You can do that, of course?",
  "48821": "What am I to do on this earth?",
  "48822": "From whence came this precious metal, which represented an enormous sum?",
  "48823": "Do you think he did it on purpose?",
  "48824": "And you, where are you going?",
  "48825": "Yet you didn't tell me?",
  "48826": "Well, well, well, what?",
  "48827": "And who wishes to speak with me?",
  "48828": "Am I dreaming?",
  "48829": "Why, rising by the roadside here, do you the colors greet?",
  "48830": "Who can tell, your honor?",
  "48831": "I wonder what I should be like then?",
  "48832": "What mean you, lords?",
  "48833": "But he was right?",
  "48834": "So he disguised himself?",
  "48835": "What are you crying about?",
  "48836": "What crime, then, have my eyes committed, if their glance but follows my desire?",
  "48837": "Can a man so important and necessary to society be also my husband?",
  "48838": "And where are those treasures which may be sufficient for your undertakings?",
  "48839": "I ask you if you know any other living man who would make such a statement?",
  "48840": "See?",
  "48841": "Where did you get him?",
  "48842": "Your part of the country, I think?",
  "48843": "Was it a beast or was it a man?",
  "48844": "So you think that it may go on well?",
  "48845": "The pleasant lady?",
  "48846": "How far is it?",
  "48847": "I suppose you're not strong enough to bring the raft to this side, are you?",
  "48848": "Then what will he look like?",
  "48849": "What did I do?",
  "48850": "Are they gone too?",
  "48851": "You're not going to tell me you've been occupying your leisure in writing poetry?",
  "48852": "Really conscientious?",
  "48853": "You have a room in which you can keep it for me till this evening?",
  "48854": "What are you going to say?",
  "48855": "Somehow she felt hopeful, for was it not possible that her husband also might say these same things to her even yet?",
  "48856": "Was all this serious?",
  "48857": "Tommy?",
  "48858": "For why did he lose all his dignity with me?",
  "48859": "What shall we say to explain them?",
  "48860": "Is it for the royal child?",
  "48861": "What have you made of your slippers, you foolish man?",
  "48862": "Can one picture it?",
  "48863": "Old?",
  "48864": "Do you think differently?",
  "48865": "By me?",
  "48866": "Well, have you seen everything?",
  "48867": "Was it really only an idea, or was it the interpretation of a profound yearning?",
  "48868": "How should he close again?",
  "48869": "What prince?",
  "48870": "Is that, sir, a lawful impediment?",
  "48871": "Haven't you seen a child?",
  "48872": "Is this man your servant?",
  "48873": "The things I make up about that damned ship that you call a galley?",
  "48874": "Who does not love liberty and equality?",
  "48875": "I've got to be a regular martyr before you'll be inspired?",
  "48876": "Porthos, what is that yonder?",
  "48877": "Who managed to get on the front seat for the sake of fresh air?",
  "48878": "Tiutkin, coiffeur?",
  "48879": "Ah, how can I express it?",
  "48880": "Does he arrive at a clear conclusion?",
  "48881": "Why not ten years hence?",
  "48882": "Is the infant that stretches out its hands toward a bright object conscious of a desire to possess it?",
  "48883": "How did the star get into the icon?",
  "48884": "Why wouldn't he have it?",
  "48885": "But who knows whether I shall have time?",
  "48886": "Why then shall we spend the public money in such employment?",
  "48887": "What sort of an army do you rely on?",
  "48888": "Who knows?",
  "48889": "And what is the end?",
  "48890": "Ayrton here?",
  "48891": "How do you suppose it got there?",
  "48892": "What, then, after labor, is the primary cause of the multiplication of wealth and the skill of laborers?",
  "48893": "But we'll be still, shall we?",
  "48894": "What's the use worrying right now?",
  "48895": "Can a chap catch a likeness flying along a rail road?",
  "48896": "But is this a satisfactory method to treat a grave matter of faith, coming down to us from the olden times?",
  "48897": "Kekcaa?",
  "48898": "What do you say to that?",
  "48899": "You know that he is of good family?",
  "48900": "Beg your pardon, miss?",
  "48901": "He is then two hours in advance?",
  "48902": "There is a drive, then?",
  "48903": "What, a'ready?",
  "48904": "What is it you are making a slave of?",
  "48905": "Would you like to have some?",
  "48906": "And where the devil have you come from, sir?",
  "48907": "But what if you don't hit?",
  "48908": "Then I was right?",
  "48909": "But the trunks?",
  "48910": "What ails you, my dearest father?",
  "48911": "So you admire this kind of beauty, do you?",
  "48912": "What shall it be?",

  "50102": "Are you stopping here?",
  "50103": "Oh, don't burn 'em up, can't you send 'im word to come and get 'em?",
  "50104": "Or which must end me, a fool's wrath or love?",
  "50105": "Now, has she deserved this punishment?",
  "50106": "And may I not paint one like it for you?",
  "50107": "Why?",
  "50108": "What's the use of a lot of capital lying dead?",
  "50109": "What on earth will they expect me to talk about?",
  "50110": "Are you strong enough to stand?",
  "50111": "So I may give him your word of honour, may I, that in case of extremity you will stand by her?",
  "50112": "Would that do?",
  "50113": "You fear to see my naked blade?",
  "50114": "Didn't you know that?",
  "50115": "My idea?",
  "50116": "Why is she unhappy, I wonder?",
  "50117": "May I use it?",
  "50118": "Have I ever seen one?",
  "50119": "Months?",
  "50120": "You have abandoned the king?",
  "50121": "Where were you when you began to feel bad?",
  "50122": "Isn't tbat funny?",
  "50123": "Who let you loose?",
  "50124": "Is any one the less ill because one does not know the name of one's malady?",
  "50125": "I ridiculous?",
  "50126": "Are you armed?",
  "50127": "Do you know me, madame?",
  "50128": "Crack my son over the head, will you, you hardhearted, murtherin' divil?",
  "50129": "By what wickedness cometh this child here?",
  "50130": "Was he feeling badly?",
  "50131": "Is not this the most profound ignorance of human nature?",
  "50132": "Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?",
  "50133": "Do you think I should remember all about my mother's death if I were out of my mind?",
  "50134": "Do you forget that?",
  "50135": "Was it very edifying and instructive?",
  "50136": "Must this last formality take place in your presence, sir?",
  "50137": "Didn't make you at all uneasy?",
  "50138": "Do you attend the family?",
  "50139": "Who knows, when I shall be at liberty, that I may not satisfy your curiosity?",
  "50140": "Was it the devil who rang it?",
  "50141": "Is it unfaithfulness to my husband?",
  "50142": "The train is at three?",
  "50143": "Did you ever see me carry dishes?",
  "50144": "How is such a man to be worked on?",
  "50145": "What murderous spectacle is this?",
  "50146": "Couldn't you stay?",
  "50147": "What do you suggest?",
  "50148": "Have you nothing to show your cousin anywhere about, not even a rabbit or a weasel's nest?",
  "50149": "Won't you help me?",
  "50150": "Have you ever heard of him?",
  "50151": "Had he not corn enough?",
  "50152": "What weapons shall you select?",
  "50153": "Mamma, how can you go back in that way?",
  "50154": "Then no misfortune has happened to you?",
  "50155": "Is the island inhabited then?",
  "50156": "Who's that curtseying there?",
  "50157": "What happens?",
  "50158": "You have plenty of vermin to deal with, I suppose?",
  "50159": "What have you got to say, sir?",
  "50160": "You have news for me?",
  "50161": "Do you know anything?",
  "50162": "Where was his skill?",
  "50163": "Are we not arriving too late?",
  "50164": "Whence did you get that splendid pipe?",
  "50165": "Just suppose perhaps the baking powder isn't good?",
  "50166": "Is he not?",
  "50167": "Outside?",
  "50168": "Can it be possible we could be like husband and wife, alone, your family with you?",
  "50169": "What is the matter with him?",
  "50170": "Dare I look at her?",
  "50171": "And what are you going to do?",
  "50172": "What does she want now?",
  "50173": "How did yeh git 'way over here, anyhow?",
  "50174": "You will not desert him?",
  "50175": "Do you make money or do you not make it?",
  "50176": "I had seen the man robbed, what else could I have done?",
  "50177": "Don't you believe it even now?",
  "50178": "You're not sending the horses off yet?",
  "50179": "What atones?",
  "50180": "My daughter, my daughter, why did you die?",
  "50181": "What shall we do exactly?",
  "50182": "But what has become of them all?",
  "50183": "But what was it, my love?",
  "50184": "Why does she say that?",
  "50185": "What do you advise me to do?",
  "50186": "And therefore to acknowledge that bad and good are the same?",
  "50187": "Shall I tell him to wait?",
  "50188": "What do we find?",
  "50189": "Is that right?",
  "50190": "Well, my dear, and how are we getting on?",
  "50191": "How many men have you here?",
  "50192": "What are you going as?",
  "50193": "You mean if there's a weak place?",
  "50194": "WHAT OUGHT I TO DO?",
  "50195": "Does he know I am his mother really?",
  "50196": "May I make a compact with you?",
  "50197": "Who and what are the two men of whom you speak?",
  "50198": "What are you saying, doctor?",
  "50199": "Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I WAS uncivil?",
  "50200": "Say, for such worth are other worlds prepared?",
  "50201": "Will this sun of freedom, now peepin' troo de black cloud, come cl'ar out, an' make a bright day?",
  "50202": "What's this?",
  "50203": "Did you find him?",
  "50204": "Where is he?",
  "50205": "And since when have you become afraid of a quarrel?",
  "50206": "But can't we wait for you while you dress?",
  "50207": "Where are they taking you to, you poor dear?",
  "50208": "Why, how wet it is?",
  "50209": "Ain't that so?",
  "50210": "Suppose he finds out, and your brother, and your betrothed?",
  "50211": "Did he give any explanation of his conduct?",
  "50212": "You didn't think I was going to keep a promise like that?",
  "50213": "Corcoran?",
  "50214": "How ever did you get along in a sledge?",
  "50215": "Ah, indeed?",
  "50216": "Does it exist?",
  "50217": "How many?",
  "50218": "You wouldn't like to be a poet when you grow up?",
  "50219": "Then her life won't be altogether wasted, you think?",
  "50220": "In what manner?",
  "50221": "Will it drive me out of my mind?",
  "50222": "Would she, aunt?",
  "50223": "Pretty?",
  "50224": "Well, have you seen him?",
  "50225": "Is this one also a complementary colour?",
  "50226": "Farebrother?",
  "50227": "I wonder who he was?",
  "50228": "And when can I see this young lady, for whom I already feel so great a sympathy?",
  "50229": "Let him profit by the means as I found out?",
  "50230": "What's that about six pound a year?",
  "50231": "What is it, then, sire?",
  "50232": "You are quite sure that you do not want to sell your land?",
  "50233": "How are delights and miseries to be weighed, and reasonably balanced?",
  "50234": "In exchange for that you refuse me?",
  "50235": "Are you going to tell me that it is impossible?",
  "50236": "May I look?",
  "50237": "Is this the end of all my bursting prayers?",
  "50238": "And what did you learn from him?",
  "50239": "How was the play?",
  "50240": "But does it shut equally well?",
  "50241": "What's yo' name?",
  "50242": "How near do you get to it?",
  "50243": "And who is the magistrate who has reason to complain of the agent?",
  "50244": "Who are you talking of?",
  "50245": "I wonder if I shall ever be happy enough to have real lace on my clothes and bows on my caps?",
  "50246": "Did you think he was too good to go?",
  "50247": "Come, now?",
  "50248": "Marry whom?",
  "50249": "You know his house, don't you?",
  "50250": "Alas, had she not declared to him that everything was finished?",
  "50251": "Was it not unhealthful?",
  "50252": "Her hair isn't red, is it?",
  "50253": "What happened during the night?",
  "50254": "If two and two made four when we were happy together, surely they make four now?",
  "50255": "How near to you?",
  "50256": "Has the queen any further commands for me now?",
  "50257": "May it not frighten her terribly?",
  "50258": "And what was the end of this worthy man?",
  "50259": "Are the oysters good?",
  "50260": "Which colour strikes most?",
  "50261": "When the devil would you have a man be afraid but when there is so much cause?",
  "50262": "But what happened ?",
  "50263": "But how came that first note to be inserted in your journal?",
  "50264": "Then addressing herself to me, asked, with ineffable complacency, if I was the person who had been so cruelly used by robbers?",
  "50265": "But why could he not tell you this?",
  "50266": "Unseen then?",
  "50267": "Are you sure you don't mind?",
  "50268": "Will you give me an egg to eat?",
  "50269": "Would she ever live to see it?",
  "50270": "A cart?",
  "50271": "Will you sell your rapier?",
  "50272": "What is the reader's conceived opinion of the duties and labors of a missionary in a heathen land?",
  "50273": "But if his daily death was the theme of the legend, why was it celebrated by an annual ceremony?",
  "50274": "Old fellow, can you let me have thirty pounds?",
  "50275": "How do you manage to get people to talk about it?",
  "50276": "Did not you see me tip you the wink to leave off in time?",
  "50277": "A shilling a leg?",
  "50278": "Rid myself of that nightmare?",
  "50279": "Could there possibly have been a more exact guide?",
  "50280": "Why, do you think I should be any happier if I were to feel disturbed about the excavations you tell me of?",
  "50281": "But how am I to climb?",
  "50282": "What is your love to mine?",
  "50283": "Love covers a multitude of sins, and of whom could you ask more freely than of him?",
  "50284": "Did you observe that man's eyes while he was speaking to us?",
  "50285": "And who is she, this woman that you want to see?",
  "50286": "Still, are they going to do it shortly?",
  "50287": "What do you mean, master of mine?",
  "50288": "And of what other trees?",
  "50289": "May we not conjecture that they belonged to the people who resided in the town, and who were victorious in the engagement?",
  "50290": "Could a man be born to a more perfect glory?",
  "50291": "You are vexed?",
  "50292": "You'll not say anything about it at home, will you?",
  "50293": "To our journey's end?",
  "50294": "Don't you want supper?",
  "50295": "To what unexpected good fortune, to what accident, am I to ascribe this happy meeting?",
  "50296": "How did it fare with the missions in these days of woe and terror?",
  "50297": "And how is everybody?",
  "50298": "Perhaps you'd like to spend a couple of shillings or so, in a bottle of currant wine by and by, up in the bedroom?",
  "50299": "With what object?",
  "50300": "Or is it the matter?",
  "50301": "Do you wish a step, or some place in the government?",
  "50302": "Of course you know a squint may be induced or cured by surgery?",
  "50303": "Would it not be better to rest now?",
  "50304": "But what then?",
  "50305": "Am I right or not?",
  "50306": "Why impossible?",
  "50307": "It is agreed, then, that I carry you off with me?",
  "50308": "You don't think one needs the EXPERIENCE of having been married?",
  "50309": "Quite seriously?",
  "50310": "Who should prevent you?",
  "50311": "The vastness of this word?",
  "50312": "Whose horse is waiting at your gate?",
  "50313": "Oh, why should I injure a man both worthy and innocent, who has only done me services and honour?",
  "50314": "Why did you light the thirsty lamp?",
  "50315": "Would he be in time to rescue?",
  "50316": "How did he come to be there?",
  "50317": "Why aren't I good enough to attend her filthy brat?",
  "50318": "The meeting?",
  "50319": "Can't read it?",
  "50320": "Whence doth this aspect horrible proceed?",
  "50321": "Will your majesty deign to excuse me?",
  "50322": "Shall we say it is because we have won an empire?",
  "50323": "Had he been scarred by accident or illness?",
  "50324": "What do you talk about?",
  "50325": "Or why should not all the three walk abreast?",
  "50326": "Don't you know how one longs to have something to do for some one who belongs to one?",
  "50327": "And is it so, maidy?",
  "50328": "Were they hungry?",
  "50329": "Won't you stay?",
  "50330": "Has he committed suicide?",
  "50331": "Do your ears tell you that they have traced our retreat?",
  "50332": "What made you sit in such an awkward position?",
  "50333": "Why shouldn't we both be married, instead of sitting through the long winter evenings by our solitary firesides?",
  "50334": "You think me rather parsimonious, don't you?",
  "50335": "Why are you so very shy, and so very sombre?",
  "50336": "Would any one of us be here if we weren't paupers?",
  "50337": "What other initiative, what greater authority, do you ask?",
  "50338": "Why do you serve in this capacity?",
  "50339": "How do you like it?",
  "50340": "What month?",
  "50341": "More than in other years?",
  "50342": "But could he be sure that this was all that was to be said about this enigma, and that he should never arrive at a solution?",
  "50343": "Half a mile, you say?",
  "50344": "Has anything happened, ma'am?",
  "50345": "Where is the man who brought the letter?",
  "50346": "Whither am I going?",
  "50347": "Shall I have it, or shall I not?",
  "50348": "And all my limbs unbroken?",
  "50349": "Why did they?",
  "50350": "Do you know where we could get one?",
  "50351": "Well, and you want your fortune told?",
  "50352": "Because I loved and married someone else doesn't alter the fact that I once cared for him, does it?",
  "50353": "Was it his wife, or else as like her as any sister could be?",
  "50354": "Does that mean that all men have a right to all property?",
  "50355": "How could she tell where I had got the handkerchief?",
  "50356": "And can bear to have my morsel of bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my cup?",
  "50357": "One thing and another commit?",
  "50358": "Oh, isn't that too bad?",
  "50359": "What troops are these that seem to be passing through the wood?",
  "50360": "You'd never think it to look at me, would you?",
  "50361": "What shall I sing?",
  "50362": "What object could they have?",
  "50363": "And do you suppose she understands nothing?",
  "50364": "Could I have caused that girl's death and procreated this being?",
  "50365": "What do the women find so impressive in that little brat?",
  "50366": "Well, sir?",
  "50367": "And I must cross it with silver, I suppose?",
  "50368": "A letter?",
  "50369": "Whom follow?",
  "50370": "What means this profession of faith?",
  "50371": "His wife?",
  "50372": "What place is that?",
  "50373": "Is not this thing which you advise me to do a little cowardly?",
  "50374": "Who has paid adulation to the nation while claiming for it a sovereignty which it was incapable of exercising?",
  "50375": "Have you not wished to go?",
  "50376": "Died he of sickness or through treachery?",
  "50377": "Isn't this rather sudden?",
  "50378": "To how much?",
  "50379": "Why, why are people all balls of bitter dust?",
  "50380": "You tell me nothing?",
  "50381": "What means this?",
  "50382": "Who calls?",
  "50383": "Why should I deny it?",
  "50384": "What is the matter with them?",
  "50385": "Now, children, which is it to be?",
  "50386": "Is the doctrine warranted by FACTS?",
  "50387": "Then what will you do with me then?",
  "50388": "Can anyone grasp what such an offer meant at such a spot, made to a man who, to tell the truth, is very fond of a smoke after meals?",
  "50389": "From whom had they that information?",
  "50390": "Shall I ever see your sister?",
  "50391": "Then your duchess is still at the waters?",
  "50392": "Have you heard anything of the case?",
  "50393": "Do you wish to try to do so?",
  "50394": "After all, he said in his bitterness, what can a woman care about so much as house and furniture?",
  "50395": "What was his devotion worth to her?",
  "50396": "I suppose I could walk with the rest?",
  "50397": "But why waste more words on them?",
  "50398": "What was it fell last night from the evil moon?",
  "50399": "Well, then, I said, why couldn't she tell her husband to fetch a dog?",
  "50400": "Just as she was, in a manner, pretending to listen?",
  "50401": "Two words?",
  "50402": "It was he who told you to invite me to appear with these studs?",
  "50403": "And how were they treated?",
  "50404": "Do you bring me a message from the king, or have you made a bold hit, and wish me to take you again under my protection?",
  "50405": "Isn't it a terrible thing to die so young as that?",
  "50406": "How many times have we seen it?",
  "50407": "Well, then, what possessed you to go down there this time of night?",
  "50408": "And do you know who is his lieutenant?",
  "50409": "Did not you take heed, quoth he, a little before he opened his mouth to speak, what a shogging, shaking, and wagging his head did keep?",
  "50410": "I suppose that's what your humanity would suggest?",
  "50411": "And are you going away, then, really?",
  "50412": "Do you not know that you have been dead this long time?",
  "50413": "How long a delay do you wish for?",
  "50414": "Well, what will you give for it?",
  "50415": "What evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of your senses?",
  "50416": "But should you not interfere?",
  "50417": "It would trouble me sadly to make him unhappy, for I couldn't fall in love with the dear old fellow merely out of gratitude, could I?",
  "50418": "Where were thy senses?",
  "50419": "Mademoiselle, how could you believe that?",
  "50420": "Do you understand what the word pity means?",
  "50421": "You mean it makes you feel that you have nothing?",
  "50422": "But what about women?",
  "50423": "Besides, how could one land on the opposite bank among willows which would scuttle the boat, and with a flood of unknown extent?",
  "50424": "Have I, indeed, said anything you should answer with such a cruel remark?",
  "50425": "What hinders it?",
  "50426": "Would you care fer any one that took all those?",
  "50427": "You haven't breakfasted?",
  "50428": "So what have you done with it?",
  "50429": "You mean when a woman has children?",
  "50430": "What is there to surprise anyone in that?",
  "50431": "If I only had it here, wretch that I am, what more should we want?",
  "50432": "Well, monseigneur?",
  "50433": "Do you wish me to begin admiring the peoples?",
  "50434": "Do I not myself know that I am at this moment in want of a dozen pages, and that I am sick with cudgelling my brains to find them?",
  "50435": "Which do ye choose?",
  "50436": "Did you observe any one during the first act?",
  "50437": "Have you heard the news?",
  "50438": "And what IS this on my head?",
  "50439": "Why deceive us further?",
  "50440": "And by whom are you forbidden?",
  "50441": "Who has done this?",
  "50442": "And who was that man?",
  "50443": "What happened to you?",
  "50444": "What put her up to clearing out?",
  "50445": "To play blindman's bluff?",
  "50446": "Well, sire?",
  "50447": "Any answer?",
  "50448": "How do you do?",
  "50449": "You wouldn't like your relations to be starved, even if they were only third cousins, would you?",
  "50450": "And so, is it quite certain he is coming?",
  "50451": "What have you discovered?",
  "50452": "If nobody were rich, who would employ the poor?",
  "50453": "And what do you expect the king to reply?",
  "50454": "But if she does?",
  "50455": "Where is he who could say it no?",
  "50456": "I have surely not been dreaming, have I?",
  "50457": "Shall we light a fire, so as to signal our presence on the coast?",
  "50458": "Do you think of dying, my lord?",
  "50459": "What does the poetry or the value of the ring signify?",
  "50460": "What do you believe, what do you KNOW?",
  "50461": "How's my poor brother?",
  "50462": "Is he so hard, then?",
  "50463": "Why did you come?",
  "50464": "Oh, mother, what is the matter?",
  "50465": "And what house is this?",
  "50466": "What, no second club?",
  "50467": "Will fish go down with them?",
  "50468": "May it not, theoretically, include as much of the universe as is known to man?",
  "50469": "Is it my affair?",
  "50470": "I, madame?",
  "50471": "Why should you go about the parish?",
  "50472": "Who is this ancient teacher or who is his prototype if he is an ideal being?",
  "50473": "What could those words mean?",
  "50474": "Did you never do any robbery in your life?",
  "50475": "What devil?",
  "50476": "Why are we less prompt to provide for our own safety than the rest of the citizens?",
  "50477": "I said, do you hear me?",
  "50478": "For what purpose?",
  "50479": "Is his hour past?",
  "50480": "Do you know of any other?",
  "50481": "For how, under different wills, should we find complete unity of ends?",
  "50482": "Did you ever see anything to equal it, as you steam away in the sunset?",
  "50483": "Were you thinking of your birth then?",
  "50484": "Look at a plant in the midst of its range, why does it not double or quadruple its numbers?",
  "50485": "Couldn't he have waited for the good season to increase his chances?",
  "50486": "Am I too heavy?",
  "50487": "Shall we agree to this plan, or not?",
  "50488": "Buy back your wheelbarrow?",
  "50489": "Do they begin by exciting the detestation of the very instruments of their intended usurpations?",
  "50490": "Up so early?",
  "50491": "Do I know you?",
  "50492": "His things and his bag are with him?",
  "50493": "Another shock, eh?",
  "50494": "Can I trust you?",

  "50598": "Had the remembrance of her teaching utterly vanished, and the last trace of her maternal influence quite faded away?",
  "50599": "Don't you know the cawing crow lives five times as long as a man?",
  "50600": "What do you want with me?",
  "50601": "You are staying the whole evening, I hope?",
  "50602": "Why shouldn't she like him?",

  "50605": "Good gracious, what noise is that?",
  "50606": "Have you seen the princess?",
  "50607": "Is it because there is no word tender enough to be your name?",
  "50608": "Won't you try and care for me a little?",
  "50609": "So you wanted to get away, my dear, did you?",
  "50610": "Did it not show that he comprehended his relations with her?",
  "50611": "What need of positive law where natural justice is, of itself, a sufficient restraint?",

  "50618": "Had not his books taught him that he was a man?",
  "50619": "And will you mention to me the yearly sum which would repay you for managing these affairs which we have discussed together?",
  "50620": "What'll be over?",
  "50621": "But then, what are we here for?",
  "50622": "Why shouldn't I have them all to myself?",
  "50623": "You'll wait and wave your handkerchief when I get to that turn in the road?",
  "50624": "Two years ago, wasn't it?",
  "50625": "Now, what do you think the lawyer making the inquiries wants?",
  "50626": "You have?",
  "50627": "De qui?",
  "50628": "What was it, my dear?",

  "50634": "Have they?",
  "50635": "Shall my messenger, in your name, tell your people to give in?",
  "50636": "And does he still tip you?",
  "50637": "If he forsakes his faith, how doth it profit you?",
  "50638": "Why do you do such a strange thing?",
  "50639": "Why did you think so?",
  "50640": "Does he say so now?",
  "50641": "And both should be in harmony?",
  "50642": "Why, you love him, do you not?",
  "50643": "I hope I am doing nothing wrong in asking it again?",
  "50644": "Had he spoken of himself, of himself as he was or wished to be?",
  "50645": "If he did not, what would she do?",
  "50646": "And ought not the same natures to have the same pursuits?",
  "50647": "What next?",
  "50648": "Won't you come to see mamma?",
  "50649": "Why did it happen?",
  "50650": "But our troop horses?",
  "50651": "Nay, tell me, how many histories are there filled with these marvels?",
  "50652": "It's likely, isn't it, then there would be two girls with a name like that?",
  "50653": "Do you mind my smoking?",
  "50654": "How, then, does this passion for gain, abandoned to itself, turn to the prejudice of society?",
  "50655": "If a kiss had been imprinted?",
  "50656": "Well, do you attend the function tonight?",
  "50657": "Whence the cause of this singular intoxication, the consequences of which might have been very disastrous?",
  "50658": "But they have wisdom, else what is the use of having died?",
  "50659": "Always a muddle?",
  "50660": "Have I given no testimony of my sincerity and of my passion?",
  "50661": "That's everything?",
  "50662": "Is this the same lemonade of which you partook?",
  "50663": "And what does he charge?",
  "50664": "But the horses?",
  "50665": "Is not a debt, while the solvency of the debtor is undoubted, always reckoned as part of the wealth of the creditor?",
  "50666": "In summer?",
  "50667": "And what the devil was the matter with his head?",
  "50668": "Why do we love?",
  "50669": "And what do the rulers call the people?",
  "50670": "And how much was the residue?",
  "50671": "What do you think he replied?",
  "50672": "Or is it equally criminal in every body?",
  "50673": "Perhaps you think I shall abandon you, dear grandpapa, and that I shall forget you when I am married?",
  "50674": "What's coming next?",
  "50675": "Did your father speak of it?",
  "50676": "What was that noise?",
  "50677": "Then why didn't you say so before, you idiot?",
  "50678": "Your father breaks horses, don't he?",
  "50679": "What made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here?",
  "50680": "An old hag who said her son had the plague?",
  "50681": "How then was it closed?",
  "50682": "What is the cause of all this?",
  "50683": "What do I seek on the height?",
  "50684": "Have the enemy called in any foreign help?",
  "50685": "Will you believe that she never said a prayer in her life till tonight?",
  "50686": "Lost her memory, eh?",
  "50687": "And pray who are the persons who exhaust your fortune?",
  "50688": "You did not recognise me?",
  "50689": "How shall I break through them?",
  "50690": "That your own bunk over on that side?",
  "50691": "Is this a fact?",
  "50692": "But where, where was this self, this innermost part, this ultimate part?",
  "50693": "What have I to consider?",
  "50694": "Had she succeeded in extracting the secret, and awakening in that adamant heart a last faint touch of pity?",
  "50695": "And will you transfer me to your brother?",
  "50696": "Indeed formerly you were wont to give us some freely, and will you not now let us have any for our money?",
  "50697": "How did it come about, I wonder, that the elder officers are not here to interfere with anything you do?",
  "50698": "Natasha, what is it about?",
  "50699": "I may turn my back on this town a few hours sooner than I intended, but what of that?",
  "50700": "How are they?",
  "50701": "Divide it by three, and what is the result?",
  "50702": "Would I speak to you if he did?",
  "50703": "Where shall I go to find you?",
  "50704": "And the casks?",
  "50705": "Said I, is there here a new world?",
  "50706": "Hamlet's which?",
  "50707": "And suppose some learned traveller should come across these specimens, eh?",
  "50708": "Dare you pretend to rouse him against me?",
  "50709": "Is it possible that you consider the sea to be greater now than formerly?",
  "50710": "Where are your reindeer?",
  "50711": "Why was it I wanted to tell him and did not tell him?",
  "50712": "Have I not a wife?",
  "50713": "What time are you supposed to return?",
  "50714": "Why, what are these doing, who are bent down so much?",
  "50715": "Five pounds?",
  "50716": "Had they restored the master's gold with the clothes?",
  "50717": "But why do you wish to bind yourself?",
  "50718": "Say, is it possible?",
  "50719": "You've bought our inn?",
  "50720": "If he were not only to sink from his highest resolve, but to sink into the hideous fettering of domestic hate?",
  "50721": "Must one not surrender his right when he is unable to recover it?",
  "50722": "Why are you so careful, so tender, of this one wrong and no other?",
  "50723": "How am I to pay them?",
  "50724": "You hear that?",
  "50725": "I hope you will not object to my remaining at home, sir?",
  "50726": "And you have brought him back here?",
  "50727": "Should he speak to her?",
  "50728": "And the first?",
  "50729": "How can one describe a man?",
  "50730": "Do you know what you look like, all together, as you are armed and guarded by your lackeys?",
  "50731": "Do you believe him to be implicated?",
  "50732": "Now, what are you waiting for?",
  "50733": "Have you got the pipe?",
  "50734": "Is it surprising, that such a tasteless being should rather caress this dog than her children?",
  "50735": "Of how many does it consist?",
  "50736": "How could they learn, how calculate, in the midst of this night?",
  "50737": "Are not the two sexes made for one another?",
  "50738": "Are these bears here?",
  "50739": "No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of mine?",
  "50740": "When will he come?",
  "50741": "What misfortune has happened then?",
  "50742": "Were they TO BE or BORN TO BE?",
  "50743": "We haven't the dust to bother us, as the men have, and whoever heard of a horse stepping on a man?",
  "50744": "And how far from the edge of the wood?",
  "50745": "When you get through working your horses this fall, will you turn them out in the snow?",
  "50746": "If it's all wrong, why does he read them?",
  "50747": "Why, said I, are you afraid I should confederate with them to commit a robbery upon my master?",
  "50748": "This famous invention of yours?",
  "50749": "Don't you want any?",
  "50750": "But what are you shouting for?",
  "50751": "Or what is your name?",
  "50752": "Do you mind him only having two noises?",
  "50753": "Was that poetry?",
  "50754": "Have we done?",
  "50755": "Why take less critical utilitarians as the only exponents of the school?",
  "50756": "And where do you find them?",
  "50757": "Should he, on the very threshold of such an errand, be afraid?",
  "50758": "Are you married, or are you not?",
  "50759": "The lamps are right, are they?",
  "50760": "For what purpose is your question?",
  "50761": "No luck for old fellows, then, my sweet bud of the wilderness?",
  "50762": "But didn't you yesterday wear a beard, and long hair, and dust in your hair?",
  "50763": "Did the other boys do so?",
  "50764": "Is it possible to transmit a projectile up to the moon?",
  "50765": "Would you like my carbine?",
  "50766": "You spent that cent I give ye, eh, an' got so much that it made ye sick?",
  "50767": "So you do remember some things?",
  "50768": "Don't you like eggs?",
  "50769": "Off I go where?",
  "50770": "And would not my four months' silence appear to him a tacit acceptance of our situation?",
  "50771": "Pray is your lodger within?",
  "50772": "What is easier, you know?",
  "50773": "What, you must leave?",
  "50774": "But how can I?",
  "50775": "What is it you want, dear grandpapa?",
  "50776": "Why don't you drink it?",
  "50777": "Shall the air never again be lighted with the glare of our guns?",
  "50778": "Had this sphinx his fore paws in crime and his hind paws in authority?",

  "50783": "Did they try to fight you when you saw 'em?",
  "50784": "Your excellency, how come you to be here?",
  "50785": "Well, then, a horse?",
  "50786": "As valiant as was that other?",
  "50787": "Alas, but that sentence is a puddle, is it not?",
  "50788": "I really, my dear, described to you a manner?",
  "50789": "You pelief, ten, in te possibilty of te odd ?",

  "50795": "Might I see you sew it up?",
  "50796": "Is he a deputy?",
  "50797": "Do say something more?",
  "50798": "You're not afraid of the snow melting first?",
  "50799": "But how?",
  "50800": "But won't you have some tea?",
  "50801": "I'd be a nice sight, wouldn't I, rowing down the pond in a flat?",
  "50802": "Is it very late, mother?",
  "50803": "How are ye, lads?",
  "50804": "What next, I mean?",
  "50805": "Well why don't you DO it?",
  "50806": "And now, what must we do?",
  "50807": "Will this closet suit you, my brother?",
  "50808": "How could I answer?",
  "50809": "What of that?",
  "50810": "Yet if it doesn't work?",
  "50811": "Is there any particular and special reason for your being unable to do either?",
  "50812": "Why will not the marechal advance me a portion of my patrimony?",
  "50813": "What were you crying for?",
  "50814": "Will you mount?",
  "50815": "If you were a regular motorman, and had been treated as we've been, you wouldn't want any one to come in and take your place, would you?",
  "50816": "Still attracts a little, eh?",
  "50817": "Did his spirit sink as he approached his dreary home, oppressed with a dark foreboding of what the future should bring forth?",
  "50818": "So you DID get here, after all?",
  "50819": "Early?",
  "50820": "What is it that really happens?",
  "50821": "Equally?",
  "50822": "Whither, then, shall we turn for our conception of man's nature?",
  "50823": "And now, how can I retrace the impression left upon me by that walk under the waters?",
  "50824": "How can she know how much we think of our darling?",
  "50825": "There was an advertisement of yours in the papers this morning?",
  "50826": "A being?",
  "50827": "Will you not come and choose your own beasts tomorrow?",
  "50828": "What can I say on the matter?",
  "50829": "And how was she to divide the guests between the marquee and the parlour?",
  "50830": "Did you get my note?",
  "50831": "Well, then, what can be done?",
  "50832": "Sell them?",

  "50838": "What can that matter to him?",
  "50839": "What do you think of her?",
  "50840": "But how can I wear ornaments if you, who are the elder sister, will never wear them?",
  "50841": "But what matters that?",
  "50842": "What kind of country should we have to deal with?",
  "50843": "Had the word lost its power, or could the failing eye and weary sense no longer answer to the touch of that mighty inspiration?",
  "50844": "At their age?",
  "50845": "What would therefore be more open to him than to keep her in love with him?",
  "50846": "Not to your ladyship's knowledge, perhaps?",
  "50847": "I hope you are not angry with him?",
  "50848": "Why do you look at the thing, then?",
  "50849": "McNabbs?",
  "50850": "Do you wish me to lend you some?",
  "50851": "Can you use your sails?",
  "50852": "Towards what?",
  "50853": "Could I say a few words with you in the next box?",
  "50854": "But what shall you do with him?",
  "50855": "But can there be any difficulty in proving, that vice and virtue are not matters of fact, whose existence we can infer by reason?",
  "50856": "Since a puff of tobacco can cloud it, shall I follow the fitful fire?",
  "50857": "She will not take poison and have horrid pains, will she?",
  "50858": "Is that right?",
  "50859": "And yet you will let me perish with hunger?",
  "50860": "Why cannot I speak out?",
  "50861": "And why YOU?",
  "50862": "Are they and we no longer the same men?",
  "50863": "You feel quite at home here again, I dare say?",
  "50864": "Was I laughing?",
  "50865": "Has any thing happened?",
  "50866": "When went he?",
  "50867": "Gone already?",
  "50868": "Does she not share in the general jubilee?",
  "50869": "Is it rational to favor one's neighbor, to be proud of one's native town, which may be a poor sort of a town?",
  "50870": "Which way?",
  "50871": "And did you give it to him?",
  "50872": "What became of the poor woman?",
  "50873": "How could you send me such reports as these?",
  "50874": "Miss me?",
  "50875": "Oh, ciphers is it?",
  "50876": "Had always the headache?",
  "50877": "Can any of them read?",
  "50878": "Have I the pleasure of seeing that gentleman before me?",
  "50879": "When?",
  "50880": "Why do you want water?",
  "50881": "Is she married?",
  "50882": "Is there any such foolish thing in the world, ha?",
  "50883": "By the way, why doesn't he come?",
  "50884": "Did any one of the thirteen colonies entertain such a design or expectation?",
  "50885": "Massa's book say I's one hundred and eight, an' dat is eight years for another hundred, ain't it?",
  "50886": "Why, what has happened?",
  "50887": "What soul his future conduct can foresee?",
  "50888": "What praise shall we bestow?",

  "52509": "Is he bitten by the leeches?",
  "52510": "What, the hinges?",
  "52511": "And then, how had it answered, that plan of his of keeping her all to himself?",
  "52512": "Where is this lemonade?",
  "52513": "Have you nearly done?",
  "52514": "What did most of the people do?",
  "52515": "Funny, ain't it?",
  "52516": "Surely you are mistaken?",
  "52517": "By exalting himself, or endeavoring to abase me?",
  "52518": "Are we at the end?",
  "52519": "Well, who doubts it?",
  "52520": "Have you endeavoured to trace any of the securities here mentioned?",
  "52521": "When did you find it out?",
  "52522": "Who, may I ask?",
  "52523": "Now, how had this noble rescue been accomplished?",
  "52524": "Seems a fate in it, don't there?",
  "52525": "Could it be done on horseback, think you?",

  "52543": "How do you do, sir?",
  "52544": "What a GIGANTIC strength of will, eh?",
  "52545": "And against whom?",
  "52546": "And have you any children?",
  "52547": "And I see you think he's a horrid man?",
  "52548": "Will I take the peas with me?",
  "52549": "Counsels upon what, sire?",

  "52553": "What made you think of ambition?",
  "52554": "You do get so attached to things like that, don't you?",
  "52555": "Whose fault is it?",
  "52556": "But what was that mangled shape lying over there among the sandbags?",

  "52614": "Won't you say that you are sorry?",
  "52615": "She will not deny us her light, our lovely little star?",
  "52616": "Have you informed the police?",

  "52618": "Would you mind giving me something to smoke?",
  "52619": "Where were you before that?",
  "52620": "Has not your eminence observed, that during the last month I have changed my remedies ten times?",
  "52621": "And why will ye not pluck at my wreath?",
  "52622": "Won't you come and dine with me?",

  "52649": "And is there other company than hers, in which with more of joy and peace I might fare to the abodes unknown?",
  "52650": "And this is not a conspiracy, perhaps?",
  "52651": "How did you get such broad broad shoulders?",
  "52652": "Quemquam poss putas mores narrare futuros?",
  "52653": "You want to hear of me, my dear?",

  "52673": "How shall the burial rite be read?",
  "52674": "But do you read it WITH FACILITY, I say?",
  "52675": "Have they not all their rights now as they ever have had?",
  "52676": "We may go, then?",
  "52677": "Where are we to go, my lord?",
  "52678": "May we go up?",
  "52679": "You are taking him away, whither?",
  "52680": "And which is more difficult to do outlines or light and shade?",

  "52768": "Why don't you try teaching again?",
  "52769": "Sire?",
  "52770": "What should I know about that?",
  "52771": "Are kings such monsters that a wish like that must be reckoned a royal virtue?",
  "52772": "The papers said something about it, did they not?",
  "52773": "But, however, why not?",
  "52774": "Can we meet them?",

  "52811": "Brought whom?",
  "52812": "Then why do you offer to go if you know that?",
  "52813": "Was he incredibly stupid, or did he understand her better than she understood herself?",
  "52814": "Uncle?",
  "52815": "Are you going away?",
  "52816": "Must I then lose this admirable being?",
  "52817": "Can it be death?",
  "52818": "Annie?",
  "52819": "And meditate?",
  "52820": "You are not aware of what has happened?",

  "52831": "Had my eyes deceived me?",
  "52832": "But what is the joke?",
  "52833": "How is it in physics?",
  "52834": "And that's all that you have away from me?",

  "52845": "And how many is there room for on this horse?",
  "52846": "May I not drink to your health, and you to mine?",
  "52847": "How, then, had she been killed?",
  "52848": "How did it get there?",
  "52849": "Can the earth bear such an envious caitiff?",
  "52850": "Is the phalanstery to be prohibited from capitalizing and lending at interest?",

  "53665": "And now amid these things what shall I say?",
  "53666": "Can you tell what we may have to go through yet?",
  "53667": "How, then, am I going to stop him?",
  "53668": "It isn't true that you are a baron?",
  "53669": "How lost you your name, my most kind virgin?",
  "53670": "Who is to lead, and who to follow?",
  "53671": "Will you, his wife, and you, his mistress, publicly swear with a sacred oath to the truth of your declaration?",
  "53672": "Has that infernal dog torn up those geraniums again?",
  "53673": "And our guardian is both warrior and philosopher?",
  "53674": "Well, did you grieve very much for her?",
  "53675": "Are you kidding?",
  "53676": "And what did you do meantime?",
  "53677": "What's that on the arm of the chair, a fur cloak or some beast?",

  "53715": "What is the cause of this exclusion?",
  "53716": "But how came you in the bag?",
  "53717": "Let us hide him away, and who is the wiser?",
  "53718": "How acts the judge?",

  "53740": "Do you still see as much of him as ever?",
  "53741": "Who would have ever believed it?",
  "53742": "Forever?",
  "53743": "You are happy, my dear father?",
  "53744": "Can I spare the time to walk with you, sir?",
  "53745": "Why didn't you come in afore?",
  "53746": "You know, I suppose, who I married?",

  "53751": "How is that?",
  "53752": "What's his game in the matter?",
  "53753": "But what had it to do with the crime?",
  "53754": "Well, if you did?",
  "53755": "Why don't you put him to something?",
  "53756": "And you said nothing?",
  "53757": "Well, are you ready?",
  "53758": "Can you get near enough to throw shells into the city?",
  "53759": "How could they then prevent the pirates from landing?",
  "53760": "Shall we expect some transatlantic military giant to step the ocean and crush us at a blow?",
  "53761": "Why didn't you bring it?",
  "53762": "Do you call it a cheerful language, now?",
  "53763": "Have you answered the question I put to you on entering the room?",
  "53764": "Some poetry?",
  "53765": "Was it possible for me to expect in a lady of such high rank, a constancy proof against my want of address to support it?",

  "53767": "Do you come a long way from here?",
  "53768": "You have a message for me?",
  "53769": "Is your man white or black?",
  "53770": "Where, sire?",
  "53771": "What do you mean by wrong?",
  "53772": "Has he not thrice refused?",
  "53773": "O, whither shall I flee?",
  "53774": "But what did that amount to?",
  "53775": "Can you produce him?",
  "53776": "What's amiss now, eh?",
  "53777": "If I am here at six it will do, I suppose?",
  "53778": "What else do we need?",
  "53779": "Aren't you hungry?",
  "53780": "But shall I put my foot on his neck, I, of all men, when he is falling a prey to the intrigues of a pack of women and clerks?",
  "53781": "That surprises you, does it?",
  "53782": "If there be no life similar to ours in animals, how could we sustain our life by subsisting on them?",
  "53783": "Could this be a desirable condition for a young country to be in?",
  "53784": "How, then, could the attractiveness of labor serve us as a principle and lever, when it is still our object and our end?",
  "53785": "Finished with your uncle?",
  "53786": "Do the pale faces love their children less in the morning than at night?",
  "53787": "Were his companions dead with him?",

  "53826": "What is the object of medical education?",
  "53827": "He's not going to die at once, I should think, is he?",
  "53828": "Mary, you heard that?",
  "53829": "But do you know in what manner I will make amends for my faults during the short space of time I have to remain near to you?",
  "53830": "Will they not be sophisms captivating to the ear, having nothing in them genuine, or worthy of or akin to true wisdom?",
  "53831": "What have you to say against him?",
  "53832": "Who still wanteth to obey?",

  "53841": "Who can have authorized such an institution?",
  "53842": "Not the drains, I hope?",
  "53843": "What have you done with your candle?",
  "53844": "Yes, but what is a girl to do who has no family?",
  "53845": "Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of it?",
  "53846": "Ever since I come here, you've been out of your senses, and what would have been the good of telling you then?",
  "53847": "And you receive silver from that man?",
  "53848": "Shall I say imprisonment?",
  "53849": "Does it indeed?",
  "53850": "In other terms, is it not the absolute, of which we are only the relative?",
  "53851": "Look, comes he not?",

  "53995": "For what purpose?",
  "53996": "Why then haven't you told me about her before?",
  "53997": "Had we the knowledge at our birth, or did we recollect the things which we knew previously to our birth?",
  "53998": "But are you sure it's he?",
  "53999": "What on earth does this mean?",
  "54000": "What was it?",

  "54863": "Have you recovered the lost tracks?",
  "54864": "Now what does this mean?",
  "54865": "What does it matter to you now, in any case?",
  "54866": "Our father?",
  "54867": "Children, who'd like to race the horses with me?",
  "54868": "Never mind, never mind, what does it matter?",
  "54869": "What o'clock was this?",
  "54870": "And would you just throw in a nod when I seem to ask you for it?",
  "54871": "What was he to say?",
  "54872": "And what is your success?",
  "54873": "Isn't it large?",
  "54874": "That's a most puzzling expression for a natural science man, do you understand?",
  "54875": "Was he not made?",
  "54876": "Would an exchange of name be an exchange of rights?",
  "54877": "And have we, any on us, yet come so low as he come?",
  "54878": "At the same place?",
  "54879": "Have you no longer any kind feeling for your father?",
  "54880": "Out, even to me?",
  "54881": "Do you know?",
  "54882": "The tide?",
  "54883": "Did you receive my little note the day before yesterday?",
  "54884": "What sort of a report would they bring of the result?",
  "54885": "And what are you jawing for like that?",
  "54886": "What did you see?",
  "54887": "Going to see the pictures?",
  "54888": "But who should be the executioner?",
  "54889": "And what was that working?",
  "54890": "What are you going to do about him?",
  "54891": "You are not worse, are you?",
  "54892": "Why not go right down now and fix him?",
  "54893": "If I name one fact you don't know, will you give me back my rifle?",
  "54894": "You may have recognized the fumes?",
  "54895": "Oh, what does that matter?",
  "54896": "From whom did you get this?",
  "54897": "Who do you reckon 't is?",
  "54898": "Why did he not break it there, since it is evident that every yard that he carried it increased the risk of someone meeting him?",
  "54899": "Which I took hold of and was merrily asking him what he would take to have it said for my honour that it was of my getting?",
  "54900": "How did it come to be cut like that?",
  "54901": "Why do you trample upon dead bodies in this temple?",
  "54902": "Whence have you come?",
  "54903": "And how did it happen?",
  "54904": "What do you consider to be the greatest blessing which you have reaped from your wealth?",
  "54905": "Where got she the strength to resist the impulse?",
  "54906": "Anything I like?",
  "54907": "Micawber?",
  "54908": "Are you a large party?",
  "54909": "What were our feelings at that moment?",
  "54910": "Where are you running to?",
  "54911": "A document?",
  "54912": "Do you not reckon me?",
  "54913": "MATERIALS?",
  "54914": "Will any antiquarian inform us, if possible, why these bones were placed here?",
  "54915": "And what do you call these, my darling?",
  "54916": "As to you, monseigneur?",
  "54917": "And had he any right to ask her for a revelation of feelings which she had evidently intended to withhold from him?",
  "54918": "Which of the three is it?",
  "54919": "What do I say?",
  "54920": "And you heard what he said?",
  "54921": "Will you give them to me?",
  "54922": "Well, and what have you been doing?",
  "54923": "Why are there no daffodils now?",
  "54924": "Is it not a happy feeling?",
  "54925": "Why sacrifice forty?",
  "54926": "Where's that ten cents?",
  "54927": "And if he left off dreaming about you, where do you suppose you'd be?",
  "54928": "With your brother?",
  "54929": "Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy?",
  "54930": "Can't you see, you're killing me?",
  "54931": "Now, dear, what are your own?",
  "54932": "I suffer from emotion?",
  "54933": "What laws are there for us?",
  "54934": "And shall she have the head she covets?",
  "54935": "Would she go out to work again?",
  "54936": "Where did I disappear to?",
  "54937": "And you have no way to get news of them?",
  "54938": "Again the law?",
  "54939": "Aunt, will you have some beef?",
  "54940": "Saw her?",
  "54941": "But I must know that you love me, mustn't I?",
  "54942": "Shall we get out and try to find the road?",
  "54943": "You found something compromising?",
  "54944": "Do you see this letter?",
  "54945": "The gentleman who receives us?",
  "54946": "Where de debble did you come frum?",
  "54947": "Has my father asked you for money?",
  "54948": "Who are you, that you should question the judgment of the nations and the ages?",
  "54949": "What would they do in that case?",
  "54950": "You have not counted me out as equal to so much land, and calculated on me as a balance at your banker's?",
  "54951": "Do you know what this plant is?",
  "54952": "Was he awake, or was it but a dream?",
  "54953": "I wonder where we can go next?",
  "54954": "Are you thinking, if I'm drunk itself, I'd leave my daughter living single with a little frisky rascal is the like of you?",
  "54955": "And what awaits you if you remain faithful to your oath, and obey the commands given you?",
  "54956": "Sire, have you in the army one regiment on which you can implicitly rely?",
  "54957": "Will it take long?",
  "54958": "What's that pump stopping for?",
  "54959": "But then, why do you repulse me?",
  "54960": "Are you willing?",
  "54961": "Have I any?",
  "54962": "I wish you'd lend me half a sovereign, will you?",
  "54963": "No, really?",
  "54964": "Can't you see those good people, with a totally strange woman bursting into their house?",
  "54965": "Has he left you for another?",
  "54966": "Can we really affect the adversary's will?",
  "54967": "Shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the sea?",
  "54968": "Was it possible for her to forgive him?",
  "54969": "D'you like all that frilly, bunchy stuff at the throat?",
  "54970": "What purpose do they serve?",
  "54971": "Oh is it?",
  "54972": "Were all those dear, sorrowful, valiant, charming or tragic beings merely dreams?",
  "54973": "Is there anything of the feminine gender among them?",
  "54974": "Lodging?",
  "54975": "Not his brother?",
  "54976": "And which of them made this passage?",
  "54977": "Not more?",
  "54978": "Has he been examined by any synod or council?",
  "54979": "Have you any objection to see him in my presence?",
  "54980": "But what about them at home?",
  "54981": "I must have been ordered abroad, but how could I have gone?",
  "54982": "What is the difference between light and the lustre which is seen on the polished surface of opaque bodies?",
  "54983": "Now, ma'am, am I a fool?",
  "54984": "You know who that is?",
  "54985": "Had she left no friends, no relations behind her?",
  "54986": "What are you doing?",
  "54987": "You will, won't you, dear?",
  "54988": "You'll take me as I am, with nothing?",
  "54989": "Things are all right with you then?",
  "54990": "Ought he to turn to the left or to the right?",
  "54991": "Who dares?",
  "54992": "But how did you manage it, little pa?",
  "54993": "Some what?",
  "54994": "Do you give it to me?",
  "54995": "Tell me, are you human, or are you more than human?",
  "54996": "And you have not made her speak?",
  "54997": "Took hold of you?",
  "54998": "Have you not talked long enough to drink?",
  "54999": "How can you be so cruel to me?",
  "55000": "Are you better?",
  "55001": "Who is it that you have fallen in love with, my poor fellow?",
  "55002": "Come, come, who did you think we were when you ran away from us?",
  "55003": "But what do you require of me, then?",
  "55004": "Do you like roses?",
  "55005": "Not just yet?",
  "55006": "Was there ever a loser content with the loss of the game?",
  "55007": "Going?",
  "55008": "What's the colour of their stockings?",
  "55009": "Why do you look at us like that?",
  "55010": "Does his daughter know of the relapse?",
  "55011": "Is it not a pity that people who are bright and clever should so often be exceedingly improper?",
  "55012": "What did it all mean?",
  "55013": "Would you like a little mash?",
  "55014": "And what salary do you ask?",
  "55015": "I s'pose you'll be starting off for college in a fortnight's time?",
  "55016": "Did you see a young lad passing this way in the early morning or the fall of night?",
  "55017": "How can you say so?",
  "55018": "Could inertia of race, on such a scale, be broken up, or take new form?",
  "55019": "And how did he treat you?",
  "55020": "You, dear mamma?",
  "55021": "What line shall you take, then?",
  "55022": "Towards a new sun?",
  "55023": "May I come in, guardian?",
  "55024": "Has he finished his turn?",
  "55025": "Mahotin?",
  "55026": "Yet why did he come?",
  "55027": "There are those sharks now over the side, don't you see they prefer it tough and rare?",
  "55028": "If you decide to go, why shouldn't you go in the same ship?",
  "55029": "Is it as bad as all that?",
  "55030": "How old are you and what's your name?",
  "55031": "Are the others coming out?",
  "55032": "Are you certain that you can afford to part with so much money, and that it is right that it should be so expended?",
  "55033": "Queer notion, wasn't it?",
  "55034": "Was that last night?",
  "55035": "And is the gentleman who fired at us the governor of the fortress?",
  "55036": "Is my pa in, do you know?",
  "55037": "Is that all?",
  "55038": "Won't you join us?",
  "55039": "Was this ever possible?",
  "55040": "Their hair?",
  "55041": "Did they leave these two industries to themselves?",
  "55042": "Do they by attaching to the soul and inhering in her at last bring her to death, and so separate her from the body ?",
  "55043": "Have you been slightly dazzled at the sudden fusion of my ingots?",
  "55044": "Perhaps you did not like it?",
  "55045": "Did he look in this way?",
  "55046": "To me?",
  "55047": "But, look here, are you a great hand with the ladies?",
  "55048": "Have you?",
  "55049": "Was he a man or only a crosseyed thief an a loafer?",
  "55050": "Or was he ordered to inflict this punishment upon me?",
  "55051": "Is that all the story?",
  "55052": "None of it at all?",
  "55053": "And how do you find home, now you have come back to it?",
  "55054": "Do you suppose you could find any good in a child by whipping him?",
  "55055": "Is it the secret instinct of decaying nature, or the soul's impulsive throb, as immortality draws on?",
  "55056": "Who was the youth he had adopted and who bore so striking a resemblance to him?",
  "55057": "You wouldn't like to marry a small tradesman or a working man, would you?",
  "55058": "And his offence?",
  "55059": "Are you sure you are not making a mistake?",
  "55060": "You mean your papers?",
  "55061": "It is a poor conclusion, is it not?",
  "55062": "It may also be called temperate, and for the same reasons?",
  "55063": "Don't you think agricultural laborers would rather have three acres and a cow than three acres of printed forms and a committee?",
  "55064": "But surely this is somewhat irrelevant?",
  "55065": "Was it very vile to be dragged back here again?",
  "55066": "Can you break an engagement off slowly?",
  "55067": "Do you wish to ruin us outright?",
  "55068": "Any how does she do?",
  "55069": "You called me a creature of civilization, or something, didn't you?",
  "55070": "Neckett's children?",
  "55071": "Safe?",
  "55072": "My friends, why do I wish for peace?",
  "55073": "Won't you even stay for tea?",
  "55074": "Can he speak?",
  "55075": "And why not with you?",
  "55076": "Well, do you like it?",
  "55077": "What was she to do?",
  "55078": "But can you make any sense out of them?",
  "55079": "He was not playing, then?",
  "55080": "Rosamond a sufferer, a labourer, a female apostle?",
  "55081": "Who could grant them?",
  "55082": "What were you saying about being married?",
  "55083": "That's it, ain't it?",
  "55084": "Was he engaged in a struggle with some animal whose retreat he had disturbed?",
  "55085": "But certain, if execution be remiss or blindfold now, and in this particular, what will it be hereafter and in other books?",
  "55086": "Did he sign, too?",
  "55087": "You're not angry with me any more?",
  "55088": "Have you considered what it is to undermine the confidence that should subsist between my daughter and myself?",
  "55089": "How long will this fuse burn?",
  "55090": "Why do you hesitate?",
  "55091": "How can I ever describe the charm and picturesqueness of that summer life?",
  "55092": "May I write to you?",
  "55093": "This will be your luggage, I suppose?",
  "55094": "How could that bring you?",
  "55095": "But all our praises why should lords engross?",
  "55096": "And what then would you say?",
  "55097": "There might possibly be some hundreds, and what could three men do, even armed to the teeth, against such a multitude?",
  "55098": "What is your opinion on the matter?",
  "55099": "Pictures are like wine, and want age, you think?",
  "55100": "Where is the entrance?",
  "55101": "The barricade?",
  "55102": "What is life at all?",
  "55103": "If you please, sir, should I have no brandy nor nothing to give the poor creetur?",
  "55104": "Is he kind to her?",
  "55105": "Who is conducting the prosecution?",
  "55106": "Is it mingled with anger or hate?",
  "55107": "What had he to do, indeed?",
  "55108": "Why, what, madam, does it signify what I think?",
  "55109": "Will it be believed that the night of so brilliant a day was for me a night of anguish and perplexity?",
  "55110": "Is not this an agreeable surprise?",
  "55111": "What can you not understand?",
  "55112": "Yes, but where?",
  "55113": "What did you burn 'em for?",
  "55114": "But what does that signify?",
  "55115": "Has it indeed?",
  "55116": "What do you want, sir?",
  "55117": "How did that help you?",
  "55118": "Let me hear it?",
  "55119": "But then again, what has the whale to say?",
  "55120": "What power?",
  "55121": "Surely he has some opinion?",
  "55122": "Will it be soon?",
  "55123": "Must I, then?",
  "55124": "Do you call that nourishment?",
  "55125": "What WERE these things?",
  "55126": "Polo?",
  "55127": "Does he like the moor?",
  "55128": "What, dares the villain write in such base terms?",
  "55129": "But what can I do?",
  "55130": "You are quite sure?",
  "55131": "Publish what, you unreasonable man?",
  "55132": "And where do you come from?",
  "55133": "What letter do you mean she returned unopened?",
  "55134": "Why should I not stay here?",
  "55135": "Whence did our servitude commence?",
  "55136": "You insist?",
  "55137": "What's the motive?",
  "55138": "Could he not hinder that, by persuading her out of her system of privation?",
  "55139": "Well, mon cher, what are you doing personally?",
  "55140": "Do you propose to me to do so, D'Artagnan?",
  "55141": "What did he know of himself?",
  "55142": "What is the young lady's name?",
  "55143": "Shall I adventure?",
  "55144": "You won't go either, will you?",
  "55145": "Is that his child?",
  "55146": "Then, sire?",
  "55147": "Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its contents?",
  "55148": "Object to in them?",
  "55149": "Have you any thing further?",
  "55150": "Why, what do they want with more?",
  "55151": "Tell me, therefore, who are these men who killed the son with despair, and the father with famine?",
  "55152": "You would wish a notary to be sent for then?",
  "55153": "Is HE her uncle?",
  "55154": "And is it really so beautiful as they say?",
  "55155": "Do you not see?",
  "55156": "Look?",
  "55157": "Do you understand, officer?",
  "55158": "From your husband?",
  "55159": "And who are you to teach me?",
  "55160": "Don't you expect to see him?",
  "55161": "You went home?",
  "55162": "Is not that stonework?",
  "55163": "You order me to receive his friends, too, I suppose?",
  "55164": "Have you any?",
  "55165": "Why should I stay here alone?",
  "55166": "Is my lord pleased with his escort?",
  "55167": "Who will lead us through the land?",
  "55168": "Is it a holiday?",
  "55169": "But where did he find it?",
  "55170": "Then I am not like him, am I?",
  "55171": "Have I a friend here?",
  "55172": "On an omnibus?",
  "55173": "And for what reason?",
  "55174": "You don't know I quit the seminary?",
  "55175": "And in our opinion the guardians ought to have both these qualities?",
  "55176": "What have they done to my hair?",
  "55177": "Have you ever slept, my friend, in a grove of orange trees in flower?",
  "55178": "But for air to breathe on the road?",
  "55179": "Is not some idea expressed in the act of exhuming the bones after the flesh is decayed ?",
  "55180": "Can I wipe my face now?",
  "55181": "In a game of tennis?",
  "55182": "With what will you save it?",
  "55183": "Cousin, what's the matter?",
  "55184": "May we talk?",
  "55185": "What were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss?",
  "55186": "So much has been said and sung of beautiful young girls, why don't somebody wake up to the beauty of old women?",
  "55187": "Or is it the master who has not understood his dog?",
  "55188": "Will you be improved?",
  "55189": "Are you rich, that you may pay for courtiers?",
  "55190": "Don't you think you are?",
  "55191": "Why do you not go back?",
  "55192": "But tell me all about it?",
  "55193": "And why do you mean to do such a horrible thing?",
  "55194": "What do YOU think of what the prince has just been saying?",
  "55195": "What need you fear?",
  "55196": "You say you fear nothing but death?",
  "55197": "Who would believe, that a childish fault should be productive of such melancholy consequences?",
  "55198": "I may order the motor round, mayn't I?",
  "55199": "And my sisters?",
  "55200": "Could the diplomat hold it?",
  "55201": "Would you, therefore, that your physician heal the bodily evil?",
  "55202": "Will you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine wanderer?",
  "55203": "Had something gone wrong with the bank?",
  "55204": "What was this universe?",
  "55205": "The question is, if the colored people are persuaded to go anywhere, why not there?",
  "55206": "What million?",
  "55207": "Will you then, in the presence of these two friends, accept me as your future husband, and plight me your vow of truth and love?",
  "55208": "Why are we to love prejudices, merely because they are prejudices?",
  "55209": "Why won't you marry me?",
  "55210": "D'you remember what you said to me the other day?",
  "55211": "And did he take it?",
  "55212": "Did you ever see a crocodile overcome?",
  "55213": "Did you see the nursing home!?",
  "55214": "My friend deceive me?",
  "55215": "Well, my dear, what is it?",
  "55216": "Would you fear to go, perhaps to your death, for this imperilled man?",
  "55217": "Must I go?",
  "55218": "Why speak, when words cannot express what one feels?",
  "55219": "Who is to prevent me?",
  "55220": "Of what was he in pursuit?",
  "55221": "Can you not recognize something undisturbed and peaceful among disturbance and trouble?",
  "55222": "And you, my lord?",
  "55223": "What was behind their competent stare?",
  "55224": "And how did this despatch reach you?",
  "55225": "But how were they to be got at?",
  "55226": "What should I speak to him for?",
  "55227": "Tabooed?",
  "55228": "Not?",
  "55229": "He can't, eh?",
  "55230": "Nor running a chance of arrest?",
  "55231": "Who said I wanted to?",
  "55232": "Impossible?",
  "55233": "But wherefore do I awake this remembrance?",
  "55234": "But why are you going?",
  "55235": "To the left?",
  "55236": "How can it be that he should think otherwise?",
  "55237": "What drives him to it?",
  "55238": "A hundred louis?",
  "55239": "How in the name of reason can I be asked to eat a mutton chop?",
  "55240": "Who knows whether these opacities will not become transparent?",
  "55241": "Eh, what?",
  "55242": "What on earth are you raving about?",
  "55243": "What is it but the worst and last form of intellectualism, this love of yours for passion and the animal instincts?",
  "55244": "Was you born a reddleman?",
  "55245": "But what do you mean?",
  "55246": "With this conviction, would he have left the head apothecary in that town?",
  "55247": "Theatres, evening parties, dinners in town?",
  "55248": "But you were pitiless in getting yourself killed like this, I shall not even grieve over your death, do you understand, you assassin?",
  "55249": "What atonement shall we offer him?",
  "55250": "Does HE suppose that people will pay him only to come and sit with them and go away again?",
  "55251": "Whence could this noise proceed?",

  "55888": "Why, cannot you see that they are all infatuated with pride and vanity?",
  "55889": "Had she not guessed anything, seen anything, comprehended anything?",
  "55890": "And what then, sir?",
  "55891": "That you do not wish to compromise her?",
  "55892": "Which is the best?",
  "55893": "Wherefore, then, should I be dissatisfied?",

  "55952": "Now will you do what I want you to?",
  "55953": "No light repartee, have you, old bean?",
  "55954": "Some people said it was because he couldn't sell it, but I'd rather believe that it was out of the kindness of his heart, wouldn't you?",

  "56005": "Won't you ever change your mind?",
  "56006": "If I were alone, would he not at times force his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or to contemplate its progress?",
  "56007": "Is not this unavoidable?",
  "56008": "Have you spoken to her?",
  "56009": "But what could it do, if any danger came?",
  "56010": "That would be good, wouldn't it?",
  "56011": "Could it be for any other reason than that he did not want to see it, and if so was he not a traitor to the cause of truth?",

  "56019": "What does he say?",
  "56020": "Why is it that the peace of the country is disturbed in order that one people may assume to judge of what another people should do?",
  "56021": "So you think he'll make her an offer today?",
  "56022": "But where is he?",
  "56023": "Don't you want to tell me?",
  "56024": "It beseemeth us both better, forsooth, to leave this undone, for why should I honor one who doth bear me hatred?",

  "56058": "Are you ambitious, and do you seek after the greatnesses of the earth?",
  "56059": "When they have no leaves and look gray and brown and dry, how can you tell whether they are dead or alive?",
  "56060": "Would we be able to see those pictures?",
  "56061": "Then if children make so much trouble, why do people have 'em?",
  "56062": "And you never confined your patients?",

  "56069": "I do something?",
  "56070": "Which way went he, young man?",
  "56071": "Are you coming to this ball?",
  "56072": "Why did he not correct our judgment at the start?",
  "56073": "How can one deceive these dear little birds, when they look at one so sweetly and confidingly?",
  "56074": "Is wealth thy passion?",
  "56075": "What is the matter at home?",
  "56076": "Is there any sense in it?",
  "56077": "And where is he going?",
  "56078": "Well, what have I to do with that?",
  "56079": "Do you not consume supplies as fast as you get them forward?",

  "56086": "But who gave you leave to cease eating mutton?",
  "56087": "And what can one do?",
  "56088": "Yes, that is the doctor we've been sewing for, is it?",
  "56089": "What pamphlet is this?",
  "56090": "Was it not for these causes that you send for me when the great trouble came?",
  "56091": "May I live with you, and tend upon you as I used to do?",
  "56092": "Will you unclasp your hand?",
  "56093": "Wasn't you bad enough when you threw all the money away, so you had to go an' do this just when we was in awful trouble?",
  "56094": "Why don't you go to your bankers?",
  "56095": "Do you see this same ram?",
  "56096": "Shall I go and offer her my services?",

  "56108": "What else could I look for, being what I am, and leading such a life as mine?",
  "56109": "Why didn't you come to dinner?",
  "56110": "Where is this poor giant, or this poor wretch of a vanquished knight, to find her?",

  "56116": "My father is well, is he not?",
  "56117": "Was it going farther from, or nearing, the disc?",
  "56118": "How is this?",
  "56119": "Recollect, my lord, if he did not say something a little like that to you?",
  "56120": "Is he really her cousin, as he says?",
  "56121": "Who's to prevent me?",
  "56122": "Why dig up the pestilence from the pit in which it is buried?",
  "56123": "The other question?",
  "56124": "I may go on?",
  "56125": "And by whom?",
  "56126": "It is true, then?",
  "56127": "Should an ass exceed me in fortitude?",
  "56128": "Would the island hold together till then?",
  "56129": "No, why should you?",
  "56130": "What can I do sir?",
  "56131": "Should I have remained in that house, near you and them, if I did not love them?",
  "56132": "And this letter?",
  "56133": "What d'you charge for a ride, boss?",
  "56134": "What is the matter?",
  "56135": "And if it be so, what is it?",
  "56136": "Mother, what are you crying for?",
  "56137": "Were I to allow you to march out, what security can I have that you will not join them, and afterwards fight against me?",
  "56138": "Reinforcements?",
  "56139": "What would it be right to do?",

  "56141": "Should it ever be said that he had robbed those old men, whom he so truly and so tenderly loved in his heart of hearts?",
  "56142": "What made you think he'd ceased to take any interest in the case?",
  "56143": "Is it anything I have done that has pulled you down like that?",
  "56144": "What could my father mean by sending me to be an inmate in this strange family?",
  "56145": "You mean you'll have no quarrel with me?",
  "56146": "Was he awake or was he asleep?",
  "56147": "Well, but if I bought the mill, and allowed your husband to act as my manager in the same way, how then?",
  "56148": "What am I to do if I love him and the other one too?",
  "56149": "And have you come from far like this?",
  "56150": "Or a new torture invented by these blacks?",
  "56151": "And what did I tell 'ee?",
  "56152": "Could she, who had been so active in the getting up of the funeral triumph, do less than exult?",
  "56153": "Who now will tell the ladies that I would hie me thither?",
  "56154": "What is genius?",
  "56155": "You have taken care, I hope, of the casket I sent you to lock up?",
  "56156": "What evils?",
  "56157": "And is it wounded?",
  "56158": "What recollections of boyhood and innocence might have been flitting across his brain?",

  "56165": "Why should we be unable to preserve a remembrance of them?",
  "56166": "There is something else you wanted to say?",
  "56167": "Was I not right in saying at the outset that, relatively to the tax, we are behind our institutions?",
  "56168": "What charge, sir?",
  "56169": "Did you see no one?",
  "56170": "Ah, now, couldn't you take me with you?",
  "56171": "Oh, may I get this rose?",
  "56172": "He asked me whether I would go with him?",
  "56173": "A'n't you getting all you hoped for, ay, and more than you hoped for?",
  "56174": "Why did you leave him on the road?",
  "56175": "And in such a case what is one to say?",
  "56176": "Yes, why?",
  "56177": "To which of us?",
  "56178": "Could we not break it?",
  "56179": "What does he drink?",
  "56180": "But however are you going to race in this mud?",
  "56181": "Is this the part of wise men, engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty?",
  "56182": "Cannot you describe her?",
  "56183": "And that which is not more or less a harmony is not more or less harmonized?",
  "56184": "A joke?",
  "56185": "What is his folly?",
  "56186": "I must, then, remain here?",
  "56187": "Who were they?",
  "56188": "Mercenary, mem?",
  "56189": "Well then, my dear, why don't you praise the neatness and prettiness with which it's kept?",
  "56190": "Have you not read in my eyes that there is nothing but devotion and sympathy in my heart?",
  "56191": "Is that worth talking about and making so much ado?",
  "56192": "When are you starting?",
  "56193": "You want no treasures and no castles?",
  "56194": "You will live on our selection, won't you?",
  "56195": "He wouldn't have so much influence, then, don't you reckon?",
  "56196": "Now then, gentlemen, shall I break the seal or not?",
  "56197": "It must have been on the boulevard?",
  "56198": "Could a statue of marble have been more impassive and more mute?",
  "56199": "Would you like to?",
  "56200": "Do you call yourself a raw country girl?",
  "56201": "And, then, do you think that my stumps are pretty?",

  "56203": "Sure it's he?",
  "56204": "Whose fault?",
  "56205": "She has formed no other attachment?",
  "56206": "What matter?",
  "56207": "Is that what makes your hair so white?",
  "56208": "And wherefore has he not been to see me?",
  "56209": "Shall we really try it?",
  "56210": "Doth any praise himself?",
  "56211": "Now, then, where's the first boy?",
  "56212": "What has age to do with it?",
  "56213": "What besides?",
  "56214": "Separate, my dear?",
  "56215": "Now, why don't you take my advice?",
  "56216": "Do you wish I hadn't come?",
  "56217": "And alone?",
  "56218": "Why should I pull her into it?",
  "56219": "You would not kill yourself?",
  "56220": "No cheering news, then?",
  "56221": "And with what object?",
  "56222": "Monks would never learn how you knew what you do?",
  "56223": "What do you keep SAYING you will for?",
  "56224": "Was it so?",
  "56225": "But the earl?",
  "56226": "Do you see, now, one reason why I have let you go thus early into the world?",
  "56227": "Will you show me your plan?",
  "56228": "Can't one cut pages with a garden knife?",
  "56229": "What needs appealing in a fact so plain?",
  "56230": "And if he have great riches, to you leave him all his wealth, or do you make him a beggar?",
  "56231": "Bast?",
  "56232": "What was it you wanted to ask, sir?",

  "56238": "To what point of the continent?",
  "56239": "From whence can she come?",
  "56240": "Will you play?",
  "56241": "What's to hinder 'em from cutting right and left if they begin?",
  "56242": "Give up the parish altogether?",
  "56243": "And what was the policy of that ally?",
  "56244": "But who should tell him so?",
  "56245": "Her voice when she talked to them?",
  "56246": "Would the militia, in this supposition, be more ready or more able to support the federal authority than in the case of a general union?",
  "56247": "Is he in favor of all these things at once?",
  "56248": "Or show you restless, miswandering, misclimbing ones, new and easier footpaths?",
  "56249": "Do you think the thing possible?",
  "56250": "Is the door shut?",
  "56251": "But what will you do?",
  "56252": "Well, then, have you any better plan to propose?",
  "56253": "What, have you a wife, then?",
  "56254": "But does nothing depend on it for them?",
  "56255": "You are well?",
  "56256": "You do love me still?",
  "56257": "Where do your excellencies wish to go?",
  "56258": "Then what the devil brought you here, being a churchman?",
  "56259": "You know what to beautify is, I suppose?",
  "56260": "How can I commit such treachery?",
  "56261": "And what is it doing in the world?",
  "56262": "Do you know, sir?",
  "56263": "And what does it amount to, after all?",
  "56264": "By his son, sir?",
  "56265": "But how, madame?",
  "56266": "What course is that?",
  "56267": "What did the gardener say?",
  "56268": "Why cucumber sandwiches?",
  "56269": "A duel, you mean?",
  "56270": "But what is thy name?",
  "56271": "Ma foi, what rival?",
  "56272": "An't that as nat'ral as walking, and as good for the health?",
  "56273": "Do I then strive after HAPPINESS?",
  "56274": "One should never admit anything in electioneering matters, should one?",
  "56275": "Is she game for that?",
  "56276": "Is it void of understanding?",
  "56277": "And who dictated it?",
  "56278": "Was it not this?",
  "56279": "Who's there?",
  "56280": "What next, I wonder?",

  "56289": "Where does he tempt one to stray from duty?",
  "56290": "What does it strike you that I've done?",
  "56291": "Money down?",
  "56292": "Jane's mother is going to let her have a birthday party?",
  "56293": "Have you not shelter, and food, and leisure?",
  "56294": "And what can be said in, at least, partial defence of the actual historical procedure of the nations?",
  "56295": "What should I get by sending to you?",
  "56296": "Sailors?",
  "56297": "You found her well and awaiting you?",

  "56305": "What the devil are you doing there in such an agitated manner?",
  "56306": "And what will that signify to me?",
  "56307": "Why will you be silent?",

  "56317": "Shall we have them sit up to the table and serve them with the complete dinner, enlivening it with intellectual conversation?",
  "56318": "Well, fwiend?",
  "56319": "Had anything occurred that was likely to alienate her from her family?",
  "56320": "And papa's written consent?",
  "56321": "How could he have been so forgetful?",
  "56322": "And taking it as a story, what do you think of it?",
  "56323": "Can he be afraid of this boy?",
  "56324": "How about returning?",
  "56325": "Don't you mean the composition pedals?",
  "56326": "Well, what is there surprising in that?",
  "56327": "Do you see any objection?",

  "56338": "So you're in the washing business, ma'am?",
  "56339": "And I am to hide my guilt, as I have done so many years?",
  "56340": "Pray what was his offence?",
  "56341": "Was it possible he had deceived himself so utterly about her?",
  "56342": "What was it you put on that chair near the window?",
  "56343": "Who else is it?",
  "56344": "Why should I try to shield him from the consequences of his own wicked acts?",

  "56364": "For do you not see the wide and unknown wilderness behind?",
  "56365": "Yes, who was she?",
  "56366": "And do you cool yourself in that stream now, my young friend?",
  "56367": "Why, especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not care about me?",
  "56368": "What better way was there to take care of his life in the helpless growing time than by passing him into obscurity?",
  "56369": "Are you going anywhere in particular just now?",
  "56370": "What are you but a boy?",
  "56371": "See you nothing walking on the shore of the pond?",
  "56372": "Which one?",

  "56382": "She hasn't got it, doctor, has she?",
  "56383": "You promise it?",
  "56384": "Going?",
  "56385": "And what would you say of the physician?",

  "56387": "On account of your approaching marriage with her?",
  "56388": "Something that crossed me?",
  "56389": "You could not have made any slip in coming?",
  "56390": "What arrangement do you want to come to?",
  "56391": "Copperfield?",
  "56392": "WHAT'S that?",

  "56410": "You think so?",
  "56411": "You are certain of this amount?",
  "56412": "Yes, but the horses?",
  "56413": "Or how remove the encumbrance?",
  "56414": "If so, shall I take you anywhere?",
  "56415": "Or will you be contented with the first now, and stay for the other till after grace?",

  "56437": "You would agree with me?",
  "56438": "The deuce on you, what more might a king, an emperor, or a pope wish for?",
  "56439": "Once when?",
  "56440": "But why should you see him?",
  "56441": "Is it sheer love of their species, and an unadulterated wish to see young people happy and dancing?",
  "56442": "Is it possible that you do not know of whom you purchased it?",
  "56443": "Have I interrupted a conversation?",

  "57178": "What letters?",
  "57179": "Will it not be better that she should keep the resentment of the insult for ever?",
  "57180": "Why do they wish to kill you, m'sieur?",
  "57181": "What could be the cause of this phenomenon?",
  "57182": "Or whether it eats and drinks?",

  "58815": "Said he, and took my hand, what do you talk of an argument?",
  "58816": "Do you really mean that?",
  "58817": "How does this misfortune affect you?",
  "58818": "Now, why?",
  "58819": "Do I not think of you?",
  "58820": "Am I not?",
  "58821": "Do you see the connection?",
  "58822": "What should provoke her to be your enemy, unless she has made you advances which you have slighted?",
  "58823": "Did you find the letter, my bird?",
  "58824": "Couldn't you knock her cap off, or her tooth out, or scratch her, or do something or other to her?",
  "58825": "Would you think, my dear, anybody might perhaps be spared from taking this path?",
  "58826": "Why didn't you start dinner?",
  "58827": "You would not deceive me?",
  "58828": "Girls?",

  "58833": "Then what is it?",
  "58834": "I am to put myself right before the world by incurring debts which I know I can never pay?",
  "58835": "What then?",
  "58836": "What female heart can gold despise?",
  "58837": "Still?",
  "58838": "What are you to live on?",
  "58839": "And this keepsake that you keep under lock and key, and moon over at times, is that a remembrance from her?",
  "58840": "And where have we got to put our heads?",
  "58841": "Which way did they go?",
  "58842": "Where could you wait for me?",
  "58843": "How do people do to get a new place?",

  "58848": "Are there any strangers?",
  "58849": "And what else was there?",
  "58850": "Suppose I say that?",
  "58851": "That you forsook your house and home?",
  "58852": "And if I were to decline?",
  "58853": "Who will remember it?",
  "58854": "Could he not rely on the sagacity of the faithful animal?",
  "58855": "Was this the ridiculous motive to all this passion?",
  "58856": "Then where is it?",
  "58857": "So you object to being called sonny, do you?",
  "58858": "Ought I to take the money?",
  "58859": "Would that be harm?",
  "58860": "Have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled that force must be called in to win back our love?",
  "58861": "Your son?",
  "58862": "I trust I give no offence to the companion of my youth, in submitting this proposition to his cooler judgement?",
  "58863": "E vero?",
  "58864": "Didn't you see me?",
  "58865": "You believe it, surely?",
  "58866": "These books?",
  "58867": "There, now you'll go and inform the king, will you not?",
  "58868": "But what good would it do her then, you know, when she was drowned?",
  "58869": "What does the city say to you?",
  "58870": "Did you ever meet her at home?",
  "58871": "You will change it, won't you?",
  "58872": "I hope you are none the worse for your exertions tonight?",

  "58875": "What shall I say more?",
  "58876": "How does it taste?",
  "58877": "And if they should altogether praise me, how could I go to sleep on THEIR praise?",
  "58878": "Have you any notion of self or substance?",
  "58879": "Is it very bad?",
  "58880": "Remember?",
  "58881": "Isn't it nice to get credit even for bad work?",
  "58882": "And can you trust your missis?",
  "58883": "Didn't you say something else?",
  "58884": "What, then, of revenge?",
  "58885": "Corrupting themselves and the men with whose passions they played?",
  "58886": "Did I not tell you so?",
  "58887": "And how?",
  "58888": "What about me, then?",
  "58889": "Gentlemen, who wishes to bet with me?",
  "58890": "'Back' her?",
  "58891": "Is it serious?",
  "58892": "Cromwell?",
  "58893": "But won't they be veg'table, like everything else here?",
  "58894": "And what ailed the chestnut tree?",
  "58895": "You say that your fare told you that he was a detective?",
  "58896": "The soul, I said, being, as is now proven, immortal, must be the fairest of compositions and cannot be compounded of many elements?",
  "58897": "What's he been a doing of?",
  "58898": "Hadn't you got anything better to occupy your mind?",

  "58902": "Which shall sing?",
  "58903": "You don't?",
  "58904": "Do you mean he's a stranger?",
  "58905": "How, then, could he conceal the launch and yet have her at hand when wanted?",
  "58906": "Isn't it the same whether I go for the whole night or a part only?",
  "58907": "Whither hurries this crowd like the waves of a furious sea under the torrents of a tropical sun pouring its heat upon our heads?",
  "58908": "Do they not know me?",
  "58909": "Why, what makes you ask that?",
  "58910": "How is one to help feeling sad?",
  "58911": "Is that trembling cry a song?",
  "58912": "Oh, my friend, why, think you, did I go so far round, why take so long to tell so simple a thing?",
  "58913": "Not married?",
  "58914": "What was most required by citizens?",
  "58915": "And so the mad dog has strangled him?",
  "58916": "Liveth it yet in the world?",
  "58917": "What shall we gain by fighting them?",
  "58918": "And you tell me this magistrate expressed great sympathy and commiseration for you?",
  "58919": "What ARE you thinking about?",
  "58920": "Is she clever?",
  "58921": "How long since the helmet, the coat of mail, and the battle axe, were laid aside?",
  "58922": "But is she very ill?",
  "58923": "And why if they were guilty of not carrying out a prearranged plan were they not tried and punished?",
  "58924": "Valentine?",
  "58925": "But silence, do you hear me?",
  "58926": "What love, what fidelity, what constancy is there equal to that of a nurse with good wages?",
  "58927": "Horatio?",
  "58928": "But whats the cause that you concealde me since?",
  "58929": "How then is it possible, that the same substance can at once be modifyed into that square table, and into this round one?",
  "58930": "What have you come for?",
  "58931": "In what?",
  "58932": "A change so shameful, say, what cause has wrought?",
  "58933": "Whither away so fast?",
  "58934": "You think the mummy was abstracted?",
  "58935": "Is he courteous?",
  "58936": "Will your majesty speak now?",
  "58937": "Would you like to speak to him?",
  "58938": "And you will give me as long as I want?",
  "58939": "Capital?",
  "58940": "Well, are you talking?",
  "58941": "Come, ain't that what you saw?",
  "58942": "And when did you go down?",
  "58943": "Does my uncle think what YOU think?",
  "58944": "Isn't her dress quite delightful?",
  "58945": "And what shall I do there?",
  "58946": "Am I all ready now?",
  "58947": "Then you accept his offer?",
  "58948": "Has anything happened while I have been away?",
  "58949": "Castiglione die?",
  "58950": "Do you believe that I love you?",
  "58951": "Or where is the war on which a world was staked till now?",
  "58952": "But does that hare come here still?",
  "58953": "But which was the way?",
  "58954": "I suppose you have no hint to give me?",
  "58955": "And you are quite certain of having seen this fire?",
  "58956": "Why, do you not recollect the name of the celebrated bandit by whom I was made prisoner?",
  "58957": "So you've found your folk?",
  "58958": "Will master risk it?",
  "58959": "Won't you come in and sit down?",
  "58960": "In morals too, is not THE TREE KNOWN BY THE FRUIT?",
  "58961": "Never studied for the stage?",
  "58962": "Will you just listen to me for a moment?",
  "58963": "Now will you think over my proposal, and meet me here the first fine day next week, and say if you are still in the same mind?",
  "58964": "Perhaps, but why?",
  "58965": "Do you, dear boy?",
  "58966": "Was the ship built so long ago as that?",
  "58967": "Have work and the necessity of work?",
  "58968": "While you were carrying me yesterday, did I not see in the west a mountain which commands the country?",
  "58969": "Our army would doubtless go forward at daybreak, but was it already occupying this place?",
  "58970": "But do you want any?",
  "58971": "Where are the wenches?",
  "58972": "Come, squire, when do you mean to pay her?",
  "58973": "What could we fasten this onto?",
  "58974": "Who could it possibly be?",
  "58975": "What did he tell you?",
  "58976": "Having got it, why do you give me the pain of looking at you for another moment, and seeing what you have become?",
  "58977": "And so you will not tell me?",
  "58978": "And does he not do so with reason?",
  "58979": "Have you seen them?",
  "58980": "But what was there to laugh at in it?",
  "58981": "What was meant by the invective against him who had no music in his soul?",

  "58990": "What still remaineth to me?",
  "58991": "Why not stay on quietly here, like us, and be jolly?",
  "58992": "Can one tell what goes on in such undeveloped brains?",
  "58993": "What do you mean by this noise, you hussies?",
  "58994": "And the devil teaches you to swear at daddy?",
  "58995": "Where is it now, then?",
  "58996": "What can he be to me when he shall have married the daughter of such a man as that?",
  "58997": "You have heard people talking about it, no doubt?",

  "59154": "Did this hatred still seek for vengeance?",
  "59155": "That night when it snew so hard?",
  "59156": "Do my countrymen need any assurance that such a catastrophe is not to overtake them while I possess the power to stay it?",
  "59157": "And why do I ask you?",
  "59158": "And what do you think of it?",
  "59159": "Am I to drive you to the entrance?",

  "59606": "But you will come, won't you?",
  "59607": "If you didn't see him, how do you know he was in the loft?",
  "59608": "Then you expect to hold a parley with these blacks?",
  "59609": "Don't the words seem to come of themselves, and fill up the blanks?",
  "59610": "Are ye not very ripe for the sermon of death?",
  "59611": "Won't you come with us?",
  "59612": "Do you know what my name is?",
  "59613": "But the baby?",
  "59614": "Haven't I?",
  "59615": "Am I in the other world?",
  "59616": "How do you think of acting?",
  "59617": "Don't you remember that I said I'd never see you again?",
  "59618": "What have you done?",
  "59619": "What is thy visit's purpose?",
  "59620": "A glass of srub and water, now?",
  "59621": "Do you see that idle lad riding while his old father has to walk?",
  "59622": "Cartouche?",
  "59623": "Of course I shall never seen anything more of either of you now?",
  "59624": "Who could there be?",
  "59625": "Is it WHOM you like?",
  "59626": "Eh?",
  "59627": "Does he know the word?",
  "59628": "And I'm to be bridesmaid, aren't I?",
  "59629": "What trick would it be?",
  "59630": "He was calm and radiant, was he not?",
  "59631": "I give you my word I won't, only what shall I say when they ask me?",
  "59632": "Don't mean it?",
  "59633": "How could this be?",
  "59634": "Is this, my dear friend, what we agreed upon?",
  "59635": "About this who can tell?",
  "59636": "Are you in a hurry?",
  "59637": "I went my way, filled with amazement, asking myself what this all meant, to what race of beings belonged this huntress of the tombs?",
  "59638": "Were there many there?",
  "59639": "What phenomenon was this that had produced a cataclysm so tremendous in effect upon earth, sky, and sea?",
  "59640": "I wonder who he can be, anyhow?",
  "59641": "You do not tell me what I am to grant you?",
  "59642": "Now do tell us why you must needs lie about it?",
  "59643": "Is he come again?",
  "59644": "Cannot the enemy ford the river?",
  "59645": "Will you come and dine with me?",
  "59646": "Told whom?",
  "59647": "Where do we stand?",
  "59648": "And the pain in your chest?",
  "59649": "Should he send another detachment to the rescue of the first?",
  "59650": "Can I be both?",
  "59651": "And you will not come in, then?",
  "59652": "Why be afraid?",
  "59653": "Why had he fled?",
  "59654": "He will be condemned, will he not?",
  "59655": "We four?",
  "59656": "Would you like me never to see anyone?",
  "59657": "IS that grass in the hollow green or golden?",
  "59658": "What would this mean but that, practically, he was never to be tried or tested?",
  "59659": "Have you ever seen this stone in the chemist's shops, the beautiful and transparent one, from which they kindle fire?",
  "59660": "Or do they only believe the stammerer?",
  "59661": "You think, then, I have something to dread?",
  "59662": "Had, you mean a social situation?",
  "59663": "Took eleven calls, did he?",
  "59664": "What could this house be?",
  "59665": "Where are you?",
  "59666": "Dog?",
  "59667": "What point of view?",
  "59668": "And isn't that what we do best?",
  "59669": "Have I not for eighteen months been doing everything to obtain it?",
  "59670": "You are of that opinlon?",
  "59671": "Have I by any means displeased you?",
  "59672": "Why not again?",
  "59673": "What wonder, after that, that a lazy city, where no industry was carried on, became a den of avarice?",
  "59674": "And pertinent to what does my father reply, by words so sceptical, to an assertion so seldom disputed?",
  "59675": "Why did you not tell me monsieur, that you came to relate me this?",
  "59676": "So, I suppose, if I were to come in at twelve o'clock at night, the child would have had nothing to eat?",
  "59677": "Who are your parents?",
  "59678": "Had you any special object?",
  "59679": "The first week?",
  "59680": "Who's there?",
  "59681": "And have you any on hand just now?",
  "59682": "Don't you remember shooting a pigeon, you and I, one day?",
  "59683": "Od send, if I've not been his friend, who has, I should like to know?",
  "59684": "Where is she, I ask?",
  "59685": "Why do you both want to bully me?",
  "59686": "How have I freed myself from loathing?",
  "59687": "How much is left in the puhse?",
  "59688": "Oh, don't you think he's changed?",
  "59689": "Well, I suppose you've been back in the woods laying in a supply of switches for tomorrow?",
  "59690": "What do you want to turn on me like that for?",
  "59691": "How could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance, which she had been obliged to give in the other?",
  "59692": "But where am I to sit?",
  "59693": "But does it not show great weakness?",
  "59694": "Where must we place him?",
  "59695": "The what, you dog?",
  "59696": "Will he come?",
  "59697": "When will she take her first communion?",
  "59698": "Do you know the reason monkeys are no good?",
  "59699": "Have you brought me what you said you would?",
  "59700": "You have not had a cable, have you?",
  "59701": "What calumny is this?",
  "59702": "Have you any passengers?",
  "59703": "In fact, would it not be less valuable in this, that it would break no great line of the enemy's communications, while mine would?",
  "59704": "All your population?",
  "59705": "Is it still only an intention, your eminence?",
  "59706": "Have you brought forth children as she has done?",
  "59707": "Was it too abrupt a transition from the habits of the twelve preceding years?",
  "59708": "Did you kill him then?",
  "59709": "I can go out with him if I want to, can't I?",
  "59710": "How could they have done that?",
  "59711": "Is there one of your fathers or mothers or friends who does not see through them?",
  "59712": "But the motive for this meeting?",
  "59713": "Do you not see how very suggestive that is?",
  "59714": "See you not the scar of the awl?",
  "59715": "Was it for that you mightn't go back?",
  "59716": "What's kep us poor?",
  "59717": "Do we not know that man is frail and fickle, that his heart is full of delusions, and that his lips are a distillery of falsehood?",
  "59718": "Why were all these acts?",
  "59719": "How the devil can you dream of fawning on me?",
  "59720": "Which part should I keep back?",
  "59721": "Are there not cases where insurrection rises to the dignity of duty?",
  "59722": "Do you hear, somebody?",
  "59723": "Botanist, weakling?",
  "59724": "What does that signify?",
  "59725": "Oh whither shall I fly ?",
  "59726": "Would he never have a home of his own?",
  "59727": "NEVER?",
  "59728": "Must I go up or down?",
  "59729": "But a propos of this cloak, dear D'Artagnan, will you allow me to offer you a little advice?",
  "59730": "You know it then?",
  "59731": "Hey, are you dumb?",
  "59732": "Who brought it here?",
  "59733": "What are your excellency's orders?",
  "59734": "What is this, my lord?",
  "59735": "And of whom?",
  "59736": "When do you intend to give up sermonising?",
  "59737": "Deduce what?",
  "59738": "You haven't got a needle and thread I suppose?",
  "59739": "What is your address?",
  "59740": "His days, then, are shorter than ours?",
  "59741": "How is the old boy?",
  "59742": "If he did not, should he risk trying to make an ally of her?",
  "59743": "And how about her?",
  "59744": "Where is my funnel?",
  "59745": "Why all?",
  "59746": "How can you suppose that so brilliant a destiny will be extinguished in that remote and miserable scene?",
  "59747": "Are you a soldier?",
  "59748": "How could he raise his head as he pronounced the eighth commandment?",
  "59749": "What would you think of a man who contemplated engaging in some business, but said he did not have much time to devote to it?",
  "59750": "Whither do ye strangers journey?",
  "59751": "And who is to be the judge?",
  "59752": "You did not notice it, then, since you say you have been told so?",
  "59753": "Now do you think I shall ever feel that for a woman?",
  "59754": "Was it not, your majesty?",
  "59755": "If I were to go to the shore some night with you do you think I could see your rock people too?",
  "59756": "Is it a large school, aunt?",
  "59757": "And how does he now regard the matter?",
  "59758": "I am not I?",
  "59759": "What's he about, I wonder?",
  "59760": "Don't you see the golden city and the everlasting day?",
  "59761": "What's in here?",
  "59762": "Why are you in hopes?",
  "59763": "How has this been done, monsieur?",
  "59764": "Who but I?",
  "59765": "Do you not know, then, how tenderly I love you, my dear, noble brother?",
  "59766": "Is the matter serious?",
  "59767": "What new master is this they have found?",
  "59768": "Will he marry her?",
  "59769": "And how could it be otherwise?",
  "59770": "You never were in it?",
  "59771": "How explain that?",
  "59772": "But have we changed as a nation even in our time?",
  "59773": "Said she, is the creature begging me off from insult?",
  "59774": "Were any other lives lost?",
  "59775": "Why should I work hard when that lazy fellow gets the same pay that I do and does only half as much work?",
  "59776": "You won't be forced to go to law with him, I hope, brother?",
  "59777": "To penal servitude?",
  "59778": "If, on the contrary, there is wealth which is not the product of labor, why is the possession of it a privilege?",
  "59779": "D'ye want to look at 'em?",
  "59780": "What is there to hinder?",
  "59781": "HOW was he going to come to her?",
  "59782": "Did he hurt you?",
  "59783": "What brings you up to town?",
  "59784": "Why must I live?",
  "59785": "You swear it won't hurt me?",
  "59786": "How can I do that?",
  "59787": "Is that why you called him a humbug, just now?",
  "59788": "Who could resist his power?",
  "59789": "What then is that about which we ought to employ our serious pains?",
  "59790": "But we are quite friendly?",
  "59791": "You give me your word of honor not to go?",
  "59792": "Me too?",
  "59793": "Where are your verses?",
  "59794": "Have I disgraced myself in any way?",
  "59795": "Yes, said she, and mine too, I suppose, sir?",
  "59796": "Is he dead?",
  "59797": "You are a foreigner, are you not?",
  "59798": "Was it ever there?",
  "59799": "What impression have I made upon your fancy?",
  "59800": "Are you arrested for much, sir?",
  "59801": "You have got some building of your own I dare say, now?",
  "59802": "For whom alone ought we to fear?",
  "59803": "Do you think anything else was to be expected of them?",
  "59804": "Don't you want me?",
  "59805": "How does it become me, well?",
  "59806": "What would you do with them?",
  "59807": "But what interest have you in recommending her to such a step?",
  "59808": "In health?",
  "59809": "What, you don't know?",
  "59810": "Who knows what babies will turn to?",
  "59811": "Where on earth do you see anything?",
  "59812": "That is your religion?",
  "59813": "Might it be, in the mysterious ways of spiritual life, that her soul at those same moments had been conscious of his homage?",
  "59814": "Will you promise not to shoot till we've done?",
  "59815": "What's the next step?",
  "59816": "What are you up to?",
  "59817": "Will you stop your noise?",
  "59818": "That's my business, isn't it?",
  "59819": "Where did you get it?",
  "59820": "Friends?",
  "59821": "Could you start at once?",
  "59822": "I ruined?",
  "59823": "You expected me, didn't you?",
  "59824": "Might it bite him fatally?",
  "59825": "What's the matter with you this evening, dear?",
  "59826": "Can I be of any service?",
  "59827": "Where in that place in the country, by the way?",
  "59828": "You killed that woman?",
  "59829": "Does she really think of adopting teaching as a profession?",
  "59830": "Why did I not understand?",
  "59831": "What surprise?",
  "59832": "Where is the mother?",
  "59833": "But how, if there were no people?",
  "59834": "I wonder WHY it wouldn't do?",
  "59835": "Did this incomprehensible person imagine that I had discovered some forbidden secret?",
  "59836": "Whom had she gone forth to meet?",
  "59837": "Weren't you already standing out there yesterday, greeting me?",
  "59838": "Will you go inside first and join the suitors, leaving me here behind you, or will you wait here and let me go in first?",
  "59839": "What do you think about imperial defence?",
  "59840": "If I go among my workmen, can they talk to me?",
  "59841": "Is it fraudulent to mix wines?",
  "59842": "Why was he there?",
  "59843": "You're no yoursel' the day?",
  "59844": "Was he dead?",
  "59845": "This is your first child, I take it?",
  "59846": "Do you not read them?",
  "59847": "To which of the gulfs did he nod his head?",
  "59848": "But where's the harm, if he likes it?",
  "59849": "You've been to see her?",
  "59850": "You know what it is, then?",
  "59851": "What is the use of a statue if it cannot keep the rain off?",
  "59852": "Where is the road now, and its merry incidents of life?",
  "59853": "Well, have you discovered the answer?",
  "59854": "When am I to see her?",
  "59855": "But who says you are driven away, or that you are exiled?",
  "59856": "Shall we resort to entreaty and humble supplication?",
  "59857": "Or in his voice?",
  "59858": "What's the meaning of it all?",
  "59859": "And what is the meaning of the two lines which almost immediately follow?",
  "59860": "Would they pass near enough to be able to solve certain physical and geological questions until then insoluble?",
  "59861": "Could she?",
  "59862": "Oh, why did I ever try to learn this man's secret?",
  "59863": "What are we, you ask, and what our life?",
  "59864": "Why, in that instant, did I not extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly bestowed?",
  "59865": "Did you enjoy your lunch?",
  "59866": "Of the other king's?",
  "59867": "Anna, is this you?",
  "59868": "And where would that lead her?",
  "59869": "Shall I ever be as happy as here with ye?",
  "59870": "And have you fixed your habitation in this distant land?",
  "59871": "And why then don't you think so now?",
  "59872": "And will you swear it?",
  "59873": "How could she refuse him just because he was about thirty pounds overweight?",
  "59874": "Who did you say it was?",
  "59875": "And could we go farther than to the moon if we wanted to?",
  "59876": "Ferdishenko has gone, you say?",
  "59877": "How's your discussion society getting on?",
  "59878": "What mean the prayers and mysterious fasts you have ordered?",
  "59879": "Are you apprehensive of the new sphere you are about to enter?",
  "59880": "Well, are you satisfied?",
  "59881": "Are you going to him?",
  "59882": "Is it rational?",
  "59883": "Who did that?",
  "59884": "Have you REALLY?",
  "59885": "Can you repair this wheel immediately?",
  "59886": "Because it has a particular quality which no other has?",
  "59887": "Why would she have me killed?",
  "59888": "Come where?",
  "59889": "Hitched to a cabriolet?",
  "59890": "Do they believe that at each supposed act of creation one individual or many were produced?",
  "59891": "What were we going to do?",
  "59892": "Had his wife a private fortune?",
  "59893": "And the government is the ruling power in each state?",
  "59894": "You don't?",
  "59895": "Are you always in the country?",
  "59896": "And we are going to wait too?",
  "59897": "Are we, sure 'nough?",
  "59898": "Why was it driving at a walk?",
  "59899": "Have you ever had occasion to study character in handwriting?",
  "59900": "Where's that robin as is callin' us?",
  "59901": "Of whom are you speaking?",
  "59902": "The difficulty of my enjoyment of that is, don't you see?",
  "59903": "But you said you had no commission from her?",
  "59904": "Would you like me to send her there?",
  "59905": "And is it that liquid that is going to blow up our rocks?",
  "59906": "Do you take?",
  "59907": "And what is the difficulty now?",
  "59908": "By the way what about the political rights of these folk under your schemes?",
  "59909": "And what do you intend to do?",
  "59910": "So the rascal ran off, eh?",
  "59911": "Where is the foundling's father hidden?",
  "59912": "Talk?",
  "59913": "Ah, she has been injured then?",
  "59914": "How are you getting along?",
  "59915": "But if so, why do you degrade yourself to serve this dirty foreigner, when you at least saw the last of a genuine national gentry?",
  "59916": "Did no one hear him move?",
  "59917": "Do you hear me, sir?",
  "59918": "What are you plotting against me?",
  "59919": "Are we surprised that a multitude of proselytes should embrace the doctrine and the passions of an eloquent fanatic?",
  "59920": "Now, did you ever hear the like since you were born?",
  "59921": "What court?",
  "59922": "But what can be done about it?",
  "59923": "Has not the experience of centuries confirmed his opinion?",
  "59924": "And now that you understand the situation, what do you advise me to do?",
  "59925": "What is sadder than a dead house, with its skeleton standing bare and sinister?",
  "59926": "Besides, what trouble is there at all in doing this?",
  "59927": "Is it a job, or a boy at marbles?",
  "59928": "You found it?",
  "59929": "There are tints in the clouds this evening, violets and blues, which are very beautiful, are they not, my friend?",
  "59930": "To lie 'for' her?",
  "59931": "But such being the case, why should she take on herself to cater for the amusement of people of such degraded tastes?",
  "59932": "You remember the place, my father?",
  "59933": "Who has?",
  "59934": "A fish of the sea or river?",
  "59935": "Was the island still inhabited by the castaway to whose succor they had come?",
  "59936": "Well, sir?",
  "59937": "Why, what is the meaning of such desperate passions?",
  "59938": "Ah, why indeed?",
  "59939": "There are so many paths leading to heaven, who knows which is the right one?",
  "59940": "Can human nature be constructed on lines so insignificant?",
  "59941": "And after all, what harm does it do?",
  "59942": "Troop?",
  "59943": "Why should she answer any such question?",
  "59944": "And is the reason known?",
  "59945": "Why can't the woman leave us alone?",
  "59946": "But if she does, what can I say to her?",
  "59947": "How, master?",
  "59948": "I suppose you have your composition all done?",
  "59949": "And are we come to that degree of misery, that our enemies themselves are expected to pity us?",
  "59950": "What did he do after he had wept?",
  "59951": "'If' you've been mistaken, you say?",
  "59952": "Isn't it good?",
  "59953": "And what should I do with these?",
  "59954": "When do you think he ever told her that before?",
  "59955": "Would you come round with me to the registry office?",
  "59956": "But who are these strangers with you?",
  "59957": "And why is he doing this to me?",
  "59958": "Why, what age do you call that little creature?",
  "59959": "What sort of a new life can you and I look forward to?",
  "59960": "Why didn't you go down yesterday?",
  "59961": "Missis has got dem bills?",
  "59962": "What's that after his name?",
  "59963": "What are you laughing at?",
  "59964": "First, will your ladyship allow me to ask you whether you have had any strange visitors this morning?",
  "59965": "But who will assert, that this is the only foundation of justice?",
  "59966": "Is it far off?",
  "59967": "Are you less cold now?",
  "59968": "How many steps have you told?",
  "59969": "Is it the form of the thing?",
  "59970": "Do the buyers pay before they bring away the things?",
  "59971": "How, my fault?",
  "59972": "Where did ye get your finishing, my dear?",
  "59973": "And the meal?",
  "59974": "What have I done, that I should be the only mark of your cruelty?",
  "59975": "Was there no one in the churchyard?",
  "59976": "Well, what would she have now?",
  "59977": "What trick is this?",
  "59978": "Are the guns ready?",
  "59979": "Will you be so good as to pledge me, sir?",
  "59980": "With her?",
  "59981": "Where is the key you speak of?",
  "59982": "But where are the antennæ you spoke of?",
  "59983": "When did you come back?",
  "59984": "Not an ill wind, I hope?",
  "59985": "Eustacia?",
  "59986": "As you truly say, if we were to act in this way, what would the world come to?",
  "59987": "Oh, where shall we meet?",
  "59988": "Well, have you sent?",
  "59989": "Or why should it be forbidden that he gaze upon the sea?",
  "59990": "If I had one that I could and ought to have revealed, should I not have long ago divulged it?",
  "59991": "How can one say what seed of good may have been dropped into his soul, never to die?",
  "59992": "Do you preach them?",
  "59993": "Would you like to be a lovely young girl?",
  "59994": "Where should they go?",
  "59995": "Why such a terrible misfortune?",
  "59996": "What should he do about his skimming?",
  "59997": "How much did the stiff have in his bags?",
  "59998": "Why won't you tell me?",

  "61833": "But what can I do, sister?",
  "61834": "Well, are you coming?",
  "61835": "It was from your wife, we supposed?",

  "61838": "Oh how great a confidence shall there be to the dying man whom no affection to anything detaineth in the world?",
  "61839": "He paid for them, did he not?",
  "61840": "And if the world perceives that what we are saying about him is the truth, will they be angry with philosophy?",
  "61841": "Can such men fall away from reality?",
  "61842": "Are those our barks, yonder?",

  "61859": "How would you like to come in on that with me?",
  "61860": "But are you flesh and blood?",
  "61861": "She's not in this house, for instance?",
  "61862": "Hoo be all wi' ye?",
  "61863": "What time do you get up to get breakfast?",
  "61864": "Well, and what do you mean to do with me?",
  "61865": "Why don't you get into touch?",
  "61866": "And you went asking money of him, or making talk of getting a wife would drive him from his farm?",
  "61867": "You include the grounds about the houses?",
  "61868": "What, then, remains?",
  "61869": "But are we not made better for the effort and sacrifice, and are not those we serve lifted up and blessed?",

  "61883": "Good faith?",
  "61884": "Oh, don't you see how much nicer it would be if it was a secret?",
  "61885": "Confess what?",
  "61886": "Is this a time to be offering pardons, or renewing the long forgotten subjects of charters and taxation?",
  "61887": "Would you care to come and dine with me?",
  "61888": "What could she have done to you?",
  "61889": "And shall we begin at once?",
  "61890": "But would you be able for it, my boy?",
  "61891": "Surprised at this emphasis, I surveyed my valet, and, perceiving a wildness in his looks, asked if he had seen his grandfather's ghost?",
  "61892": "Get it ready, will you?",
  "61893": "But you could find out?",
  "61894": "Was she pretty?",
  "61895": "Or will he say that to abolish corruption is a bad thing?",
  "61896": "And why did the body conceal itself?",
  "61897": "Jo, how could you?",
  "61898": "Don't they say as there's somebody can strip it off him?",
  "61899": "Is not all here yours?",
  "61900": "What other possible reason could there have been for her so blushing ?",
  "61901": "What made him seek this quarter of the house at an untimely season, when he should have been asleep in bed?",
  "61902": "Where can they have crossed?",
  "61903": "If such things are done in the green wood, what will be done in the dry?",
  "61904": "And whom he brought back this morning?",
  "61905": "Any references?",
  "61906": "Was not he believed to be dead?",
  "61907": "With whom are you going to fight?",
  "61908": "Then don't you despair?",
  "61909": "And why think you that will make him sad?",
  "61910": "But when will you come and see my study?",
  "61911": "My friends, why with us?",
  "61912": "What a carriage that was, and where did it come from, eh?",
  "61913": "But is that all your evidence?",
  "61914": "Why did you give him six pistoles?",
  "61915": "You deny it?",
  "61916": "How long does the incredulity with which I hear a new theory propounded continue to be a wise and salutary incredulity?",
  "61917": "Do you feel that you are a sufficiently practical man?",
  "61918": "How do you mean sad?",
  "61919": "What crime, then, have you committed?",
  "61920": "Did I tell you?",
  "61921": "Fwhat are you talkin' of?",
  "61922": "How could she, indeed?",
  "61923": "Don't you hear often?",
  "61924": "But, surely, there is some one in the world whom you love?",
  "61925": "And where is his corpse?",
  "61926": "Well, do you know what is taking place at this moment?",
  "61927": "And would you like to be here alone with her for a month?",
  "61928": "Isn't it a peacock?",
  "61929": "For instance, if you lived in the penal days?",
  "61930": "I say, what on earth's the matter?",
  "61931": "She has gone to visit friends?",
  "61932": "But why did men who were interpolating bronze corslets freely introduce bronze so seldom, if at all, as the material of greaves?",
  "61933": "And the men?",
  "61934": "Do you s'pose they would?",
  "61935": "Are you making fun of me?",
  "61936": "How could he possibly have doubted it?",
  "61937": "Who ever got a letter that was worth waiting for?",
  "61938": "What is your theory, then?",
  "61939": "You've come at last, have you?",
  "61940": "How may I tell you for what we were sunk here, when I do not know, unless it was because we were rich?",
  "61941": "But what good can one do oneself?",
  "61942": "And you're so great a favourite there, you say?",
  "61943": "Give up?",
  "61944": "Are you sure you wouldn't like some more breakfast?",
  "61945": "When shall I have you here again?",
  "61946": "If she's charming, how can she help it?",
  "61947": "And discarding all consideration of political consequences, what unspeakable personal glory there would then be to him as a man?",
  "61948": "You'll not tell, will you?",
  "61949": "How could she ever suppose such a thing?",
  "61950": "Was it the same desperate confusion, or would the ground offer better facilities?",
  "61951": "Kill that boy?",
  "61952": "Why, but will you leave him with so slight command, and infuse no more charge upon the fellow?",
  "61953": "Sherry or 'ock, sir?",
  "61954": "You have the unspeakable effrontery to stand there and admit it?",
  "61955": "True?",
  "61956": "Suppose now that by the light of the examples just offered we enquire who this imitator is?",
  "61957": "Very distant?",
  "61958": "Does his conscience ever entertain the question of his right to such subsidies?",
  "61959": "How shall I defile them?",
  "61960": "Can you strike a man to the heart and leave no mark on him?",
  "61961": "Do you know whence comes our real power?",
  "61962": "You don't suppose she could take any interest in you, do you?",
  "61963": "What's your hurry?",
  "61964": "If it be, how can that question have place, concerning the subsistence of self, under a change of substance?",
  "61965": "That?",
  "61966": "And in what light must I appear to the world?",
  "61967": "Marilla, have I really a pretty nose?",
  "61968": "On the other hand, what do we see?",
  "61969": "But what should we have been then?",
  "61970": "For are not milliners and mantuamakers reckoned the next class?",
  "61971": "She used to speak of me then?",
  "61972": "Could I ever forget?",
  "61973": "You think not, sir?",
  "61974": "Ran away with her?",
  "61975": "But do you?",
  "61976": "What sort of weather was it?",
  "61977": "And all for what?",
  "61978": "So that was the way they did it, eh?",
  "61979": "What admission?",
  "61980": "To make the people laugh?",
  "61981": "How can we get it?",

  "62778": "And to what?",
  "62779": "Have I always hated you so much?",
  "62780": "How does he use it?",
  "62781": "You will sing with me?",
  "62782": "Grant?",
  "62783": "I say, you don't happen to have heard of a murder?",
  "62784": "What did I borrow?",
  "62785": "Am I not clearly designated in that, captain?",
  "62786": "And with what purpose could he do that?",
  "62787": "What is it that this polypragmonetic ardelion to all the fiends of hell doth aim at?",
  "62788": "What has happened that you should speak like that?",
  "62789": "What means, then, this dithyramb upon property?",
  "62790": "And where afterwards?",
  "62791": "What reason was there for assuming any probability of an uprising in the city?",
  "62792": "Is it not a canonical and authentic exception, worthy to be premised to all our undertakings?",
  "62793": "Ah, friends, what shall I do?",
  "62794": "Do we not both take from the poor people that which they can ill spare?",
  "62795": "What is the place, then, upon which we stand?",
  "62796": "Is he a man of fortune?",
  "62797": "How dare to repeat experiments that had failed so often?",
  "62798": "There is still another influence, what do you say to that?",
  "62799": "What makes you ask?",
  "62800": "Killed?",
  "62801": "See you not, you goblins, that your lord and master is here?",
  "62802": "Now, who can this other letter be from?",
  "62803": "But how is it he is not already returned?",
  "62804": "What is to be the manner of her death?",
  "62805": "Wizard?",
  "62806": "Then why have you endeavoured to assist him?",
  "62807": "Are we going, do you fancy, to the house of our wenches, like gallants who come and knock and go in at any hour, however late it may be?",
  "62808": "And, conversely, that which has less of truth will also have less of essence?",
  "62809": "You mean that they would shipwreck?",
  "62810": "Didn't you yourself bring her the contract?",
  "62811": "Swinging by the chain?",
  "62812": "What put it into your head, little mother?",
  "62813": "You don't mean to say he's here?",
  "62814": "Then it is very thin wine?",
  "62815": "Did I offer to hit him or did I not?",
  "62816": "And what temperature may that be?",
  "62817": "Have you a pair of silent shoes?",
  "62818": "Who else should do so?",
  "62819": "And to what effect?",
  "62820": "I shall meet them there, and who knows what future advantages may result from the interview?",
  "62821": "Could it have been aught but a shipwreck which had drawn it under the water?",
  "62822": "The song?",
  "62823": "Shall you go?",
  "62824": "How are you, my dear?",
  "62825": "Ain't that a shame, sir?",
  "62826": "Why then not trace the rights of man to the creation of man?",
  "62827": "How did you know about it?",
  "62828": "What was the worthy geographer thinking of?",
  "62829": "How about that?",
  "62830": "Who knows it?",
  "62831": "You were alluding to the jerking movement of my hand every time I try to reach for anything?",
  "62832": "What the devil was you afraid of?",
  "62833": "What did he do before he went?",
  "62834": "Your alphabet?",
  "62835": "What's up?",
  "62836": "Which house is that?",
  "62837": "What's your real name?",
  "62838": "Why were they so strangely silent?",
  "62839": "Is it an amusing story?",
  "62840": "You were, were you not?",
  "62841": "Do you find the answer?",
  "62842": "At last she is dead?",
  "62843": "Do you mean to say you couldn't love me then?",
  "62844": "Don't you hear to what soft whispers the wind has fallen?",
  "62845": "Time to start?",
  "62846": "Wasn't it as good as a marriage?",
  "62847": "You understand?",
  "62848": "But how did you know that I was a prisoner back there?",
  "62849": "Wherein?",
  "62850": "Which do you prefer?",
  "62851": "What can be more gratifying than such a retrospect as this?",
  "62852": "What did she say?",
  "62853": "Oh, indeed?",
  "62854": "Besides, which am I to choose?",
  "62855": "Go to?",
  "62856": "But how could I, a poor dazed village lad, avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best and wisest of men fall every day?",
  "62857": "Well, why not?",
  "62858": "What does it all mean?",
  "62859": "I may assume that there is a second to be mentioned?",
  "62860": "And it's a very pretty name, don't you think?",
  "62861": "Your father is dead?",
  "62862": "Of whom?",
  "62863": "Natasha, you would not deceive me?",
  "62864": "What were you doing in the battle, my friend?",
  "62865": "But does not this expose himself more than me?",
  "62866": "And is not this the reason why of old love has been called a tyrant?",
  "62867": "What are you doing here?",
  "62868": "Why not take a number of banths and set them loose before us above ground?",
  "62869": "How long did he wear it?",
  "62870": "Is he not a prey which will always be within your grasp?",
  "62871": "What instructing do you think I should do?",
  "62872": "What took her away?",
  "62873": "Yes, how long?",
  "62874": "Is it not the separation of soul and body?",
  "62875": "It is said to have been a congestion of the brain, or apoplexy, which is the same thing, is it not?",
  "62876": "Executions?",
  "62877": "Have commissioned you to tell me what you have just stated?",
  "62878": "Remorse or regret?",
  "62879": "How am I to describe it?",
  "62880": "Tulkinghorn?",
  "62881": "Why are you smiling, prince?",
  "62882": "And if he had not, why did he take her again?",
  "62883": "That is your intention, is it not?",
  "62884": "Will it pass?",
  "62885": "Why did you pick him?",
  "62886": "Do you suppose these stoneless mounds hide no dust of what were men just as good?",
  "62887": "Where are those passionate eyes that appeal'd to my eyes in passion?",
  "62888": "What is it that you say you are going to do?",
  "62889": "What did she send?",
  "62890": "For you surely would not regard the skilled mathematician as a dialectician?",
  "62891": "Should he find him at all?",
  "62892": "Why should I meddle?",
  "62893": "The earlier it might be, would it not be better?",
  "62894": "The theories say that, do they?",
  "62895": "And what hope was there that these designs would fail?",
  "62896": "Not from the photos I have showed you?",
  "62897": "Have you ever noticed that the ones we would love the most distractedly are those whom we never meet to know?",
  "62898": "Well, then, my lord, say, are you satisfied?",
  "62899": "Gentlemen, do you stare?",
  "62900": "Well, what do you want?",
  "62901": "Why, monsieur, what secret can you expect to find in the hollow head of a soldier?",
  "62902": "Are you going to return there?",
  "62903": "What need has it of exaggeration?",
  "62904": "What if she loves you now better than anyone?",
  "62905": "Do you happen to know any one in this neighbourhood who would receive him for a while on my paying for him beforehand?",
  "62906": "He has done his best, but what does a fish's best come to when the fish is out of water?",
  "62907": "You are a reactionary, then?",
  "62908": "What's up, anyhow?",
  "62909": "Will there, indeed?",
  "62910": "Who drove you to it?",
  "62911": "We being strangers here, how dare you trust so great a charge from your own custody?",
  "62912": "You are a wheelwright?",
  "62913": "Does that suit you?",
  "62914": "Is anything the matter, aunt?",
  "62915": "But did be profess any attachment?",
  "62916": "Who are you, madame?",
  "62917": "Did you ever taste beer?",
  "62918": "Boomer?",
  "62919": "Does he mean to say that?",
  "62920": "Didn't you get my last letter?",
  "62921": "Don't you see you are not wanted here?",
  "62922": "How much fudder is got for go?",
  "62923": "I say, did you mean it the other day that you wouldn't marry me if I asked you?",
  "62924": "Is anyone up in your house?",
  "62925": "Will that suit you?",
  "62926": "Have I not explained your wishes, grandpapa?",
  "62927": "Did you see it?",
  "62928": "And, to be frank, my lord, was I wrong?",
  "62929": "From what?",
  "62930": "How was he to meet his lawyer?",
  "62931": "Herod?",
  "62932": "Cautious, why so?",
  "62933": "Was it the better to deceive them both?",
  "62934": "Why can't I?",
  "62935": "Did you tell us?",
  "62936": "Do you understand what you have done to me?",
  "62937": "Nor church?",
  "62938": "Does it end with just our two selves?",
  "62939": "Will there be beds for me and all who seek?",
  "62940": "But it's SOMEBODY'S plates, ain't it?",
  "62941": "What virtue will there be then, said the monk, in their bullets of concupiscence, their habits and their bodies?",
  "62942": "How do I know?",
  "62943": "In what direction?",
  "62944": "And of such a man too?",
  "62945": "What good am I here?",
  "62946": "Do you mean what did I say?",
  "62947": "What did the whole world matter to them?",
  "62948": "You feel some pretty well now?",
  "62949": "The man says?",
  "62950": "How should I make a mistake?",
  "62951": "Will you have hash or fishballs for breakfast?",
  "62952": "Won't you come again to see me?",
  "62953": "What signifies?",
  "62954": "Did she mean to go out?",
  "62955": "Where is she?",
  "62956": "Do you know where they came from?",
  "62957": "Did you see him come out on us?",
  "62958": "Why lie awake nights worrying about this?",
  "62959": "And if I did not obey his call, who could answer for what might happen?",
  "62960": "Or worse than the parts they acted require?",
  "62961": "What did you go out for?",
  "62962": "Well, then, what's the sense in wasting the plates?",
  "62963": "Aren't you very tired?",
  "62964": "Have you not lately renewed your promise?",
  "62965": "Whose are these beautiful green meadows?",
  "62966": "And why do we set our soul and body, which are such dear companions, at such variance?",
  "62967": "Living together?",
  "62968": "Did you never hear it?",
  "62969": "You don't remember me?",
  "62970": "And what else is paper currency?",
  "62971": "And do you propose to make this journey very shortly?",
  "62972": "But what if fresh disasters should take place?",
  "62973": "Who will say they were not beautiful?",
  "62974": "What did tha' shut thysel' up for?",
  "62975": "Is anybody to come and fetch me?",
  "62976": "But when?",
  "62977": "And what explanation is given of the girl's death?",
  "62978": "What was the dreadful thing I dreamed?",
  "62979": "I should think it was a very pleasant life, the married one, eh?",
  "62980": "But what shall we reply to the medals, undoubtedly genuine, which reckon the fifth year of his tribunitian power?",
  "62981": "Have we either of us ever rubbed thumbs over honestly gained farthings?",
  "62982": "Ah, you are the young woman come to look after my birds?",
  "62983": "There ain't nothing wrong?",
  "62984": "How can we help it?",
  "62985": "Why do you ask such a question, I said, when you ought rather to be answering?",
  "62986": "Would you say six or four years?",
  "62987": "Would you shoot a poor, defenceless girl?",
  "62988": "D'ye think he had great pain when 'a died?",
  "62989": "Which is the duke?",
  "62990": "Now, are you ready?",
  "62991": "Oh, isn't it sweet and fresh back here?",
  "62992": "Can you write shorthand?",
  "62993": "Yes, why did I not steal?",
  "62994": "Will you say it is because the body is the medium of suffering in this life?",
  "62995": "WHO is the man into whose throat all the heaviest and blackest will thus crawl?",
  "62996": "Haven't you no manners?",
  "62997": "And are who what?",
  "62998": "You are of my opinion?",
  "62999": "Could it be possible that the squire was going to make a fool of himself and get married?",
  "63000": "Funny, ain't it, that you and me both had the same idea about spending our vacation?",
  "63001": "But you will?",
  "63002": "How would the white bear have behaved?",
  "63003": "Then why didn't you say so?",
  "63004": "How much is it?",
  "63005": "You will permit me to consider him an invalid?",
  "63006": "Where is he concealed?",
  "63007": "But was it his fault?",
  "63008": "You spoke to my coachman, then?",
  "63009": "Was the photograph a cabinet?",
  "63010": "Who's go dar?",
  "63011": "Didn't you hear us calling you?",
  "63012": "For the commission, is it not my whole future?",
  "63013": "Why all this excitement?",
  "63014": "Do you know the numbers?",
  "63015": "Do you wish you may die if you do know, hey?",
  "63016": "Why then should he repine when the hour of separation arrives?",
  "63017": "She had no reason for walking elsewhere, and why should she not go that way?",
  "63018": "Where is the knave?",
  "63019": "Any news, father?",
  "63020": "When did you see him last?",
  "63021": "Why, pray, did he add the old day?",
  "63022": "You think he went off just by chance?",
  "63023": "Is the cause of my soreness such a mystery that there's any need to tell me I am sore everywhere the staff hit me?",
  "63024": "Couldn't ye ha' said soa, at onst?",
  "63025": "What be these two, signior?",
  "63026": "Can anyone here play the drum?",
  "63027": "Shall you like to have such a brother?",
  "63028": "And what is better than woman?",
  "63029": "Ye much hurt?",
  "63030": "How shall I ever look this man in the face again?",
  "63031": "Yes?",
  "63032": "You think there may be fighting?",
  "63033": "Could it be that by some neglect in the preparations, the substitution perhaps of the wrong brandy, the astralization could not be effected?",
  "63034": "Was this to her doom after all?",
  "63035": "How agreed?",
  "63036": "And those papers?",
  "63037": "How is the gentleman called?",
  "63038": "What do you mean, you minx?",
  "63039": "What can be done?",
  "63040": "And why are we here?",
  "63041": "How do you know I can't?",
  "63042": "Amontillado ?",
  "63043": "A coffin?",
  "63044": "Does it suggest anything to your mind?",
  "63045": "Is the second floor at home?",
  "63046": "You are certain?",
  "63047": "Why, did you not hear all we said?",
  "63048": "How, how?",
  "63049": "Is this statement true?",
  "63050": "Then it is my place to ask you what you are going to do about it?",
  "63051": "Won't you come in again, and stay as long as you like?",
  "63052": "Why are you up so early, my dear?",
  "63053": "Who will tell her?",
  "63054": "Guilty, of course?",
  "63055": "Do you laugh, you unfeeling brute, as if you enjoyed my distress?",
  "63056": "What enjoyment is there in making love to a woman who belongs to nobody and yet belongs to any one?",
  "63057": "Have you not a word to say to me?",
  "63058": "Two drunken men, eh?",
  "63059": "What need they torture their heads with that which others have taken so strictly and so unalterably into their own purveying?",
  "63060": "What can be more natural and characteristic?",
  "63061": "Is there anything particular?",
  "63062": "What are you upset about?",
  "63063": "But the bogus inspector?",
  "63064": "And where are the children?",
  "63065": "There are then people who inhabit it?",
  "63066": "But where is thy son now?",
  "63067": "Her happiness?",
  "63068": "Please, ma'am, could I inquire if this highly instructive and charming institution is a new one?",
  "63069": "But why not?",
  "63070": "How would they address us?",
  "63071": "Is there any thing new in this doctrine?",
  "63072": "What was she to say to him?",
  "63073": "You doubt it then?",
  "63074": "What sort of mischief?",
  "63075": "What sense is there in murdering a man in order to define one's relation to a guilty wife and son?",
  "63076": "Then this new kind of knowledge must have an additional quality?",
  "63077": "Lads, haven't you a sack?",
  "63078": "How do you mean, bold?",
  "63079": "What farther proof can be desired for the present system?",
  "63080": "They taught you that?",
  "63081": "But you, critic, the reader undoubtedly will ask, what is your solution?",
  "63082": "But the heat developed by the rapidity of the projectile in crossing the strata of air?",
  "63083": "Of all this we may certainly affirm that we acquired the knowledge before birth?",
  "63084": "Well, are you trying to make out that I've said you have?",
  "63085": "Three days ago?",
  "63086": "What is it, a man?",
  "63087": "Whom do you think that is to?",
  "63088": "The lighted window, right up there?",
  "63089": "An' you don't seem to have done any great things for yourself by going away?",
  "63090": "But if I lose?",
  "63091": "There, who are you?",
  "63092": "Or, perhaps, you may have the precious object she wants in your collection?",
  "63093": "Who do you think should be sent there?",
  "63094": "And what for?",
  "63095": "But, my dear fellow, in that case, why didn't you get him a pauper's funeral?",
  "63096": "Should he place his catastrophe as a third associate in their felicity?",
  "63097": "Can you speak, lady?",
  "63098": "He has extensive house property in the city and three places of business and isn't it to his own advantage to keep down the rates?",
  "63099": "Do what?",
  "63100": "That so?",
  "63101": "And you followed the business of a tailor?",
  "63102": "But how did you gain them?",
  "63103": "Whither should they go, and where should be the new seat of the mission?",
  "63104": "Why can't you let me alone?",
  "63105": "How does his apoplex?",
  "63106": "Ca vous amuse, la vie?",

  "63109": "What can be keeping him?",
  "63110": "Some intrigue, D'Herblay?",
  "63111": "Why do you laugh, sir?",
  "63112": "Should she speak to her?",
  "63113": "How dared they so much as THINK of such a thing?",
  "63114": "Should she open the door or should she not?",
  "63115": "Now, while you have tyranny in so great a degree walled in, and see your enemies over your heads, to what purpose is it to take counsel?",
  "63116": "But don't you know the higher you climb, the colder it gets?",
  "63117": "You do not know that you love me?",
  "63118": "What in thunder has that to do with you?",
  "63119": "No one at home?",
  "63120": "How is it over?",
  "63121": "Is it business?",
  "63122": "What's a ball through the chest?",
  "63123": "Has he found time to tell you scandal about me?",
  "63124": "Well how can I help it?",
  "63125": "Is my master not here, sir?",

  "63131": "Seeing the old man?",
  "63132": "Are you no longer my master, or have I ceased to be your slave?",
  "63133": "But there were three races, were there not?",
  "63134": "Was it the effect of the balmy climate alone which recalled him to health?",
  "63135": "Is it paid for?",
  "63136": "Were you speaking of me?",
  "63137": "An emancipator?",
  "63138": "These are the orders, are they?",
  "63139": "Does SHE look like the mother of six?",

  "63161": "How, you are going soon?",
  "63162": "So saying, he fixed his eyes upon me, and asked if I had seen him tremble?",
  "63163": "Isn't she enormous?",
  "63164": "But the man who was under him?",
  "63165": "Did he still cherish hope?",
  "63166": "Isn't it a dreadful feeling?",
  "63167": "Why funny?",
  "63168": "What have I done?",
  "63169": "Do you know much of him?",

  "63178": "I daresay you've heard of her?",
  "63179": "Perhaps you'd care to come in and have a drink on your way?",
  "63180": "Must I receive it, or leave it in the hands of the notary?",
  "63181": "What is the meaning of that?",
  "63182": "Oh, you know him?",
  "63183": "Sir, have you finished supper?",
  "63184": "What did I get by that?",
  "63185": "What has become of the faith which has hitherto carried you so bravely through all our difficulties?",

  "63194": "Do you remember that after less than a year of married life you stood on the verge of an abyss?",
  "63195": "Aren't they really terrifying?",
  "63196": "Don't you see, now, what's the matter with that ha'nted room?",
  "63197": "Why should I die, then, or basely despair?",
  "63198": "And anyone else?",
  "63199": "And what did he tell 'ee next?",
  "63200": "Do you never feel sick of it?",
  "63201": "Was this precaution or humility?",
  "63202": "Any men on it?",
  "63203": "Was it possible they heard not?",
  "63204": "Why do men halt between two opinions, and expect impossibilities?",
  "63205": "What are you wanting?",
  "63206": "Why aren't you in bed?",
  "63207": "Will not the good people respond to a united and earnest appeal from us?",
  "63208": "Who could be suspected of this mischief?",
  "63209": "But why should I not receive her?",
  "63210": "But from whom is that letter?",
  "63211": "Should we not then say that the master had only fulfilled a sacred obligation of duty?",
  "63212": "Have you them?",
  "63213": "What, gentlemen, is your verdict?",
  "63214": "What's a tall man unless he fight?",

  "63220": "If the officer be accused of dishonesty, how shall it be made out?",
  "63221": "Where is the cure?",
  "63222": "Are you on the ground?",
  "63223": "You mentioned a fowl, I think?",
  "63224": "Upon what?",
  "63225": "Is not this an extraordinary tale?",
  "63226": "What are you meddling with my deeds for?",
  "63227": "Who is it, then, that you want to see?",
  "63228": "Is it to be yes at last?",
  "63229": "What made you think she would be here?",
  "63230": "WHO is in the room?",
  "63231": "What was there to be seen there?",
  "63232": "Was there left now nothing but to break off from the happy creative being, was the time up?",
  "63233": "You are not going out, uncle?",
  "63234": "What does it matter where it comes from?",
  "63235": "You are determined, then, to push your fortune in other lands?",
  "63236": "Ain't he played me tricks enough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time?",
  "63237": "Why should I be ashamed of myself?",
  "63238": "And there are four of you?",
  "63239": "How will it do, how will it do?",
  "63240": "Did you see the libraries and schools!?",
  "63241": "I should like to know whether you have the same notion which I have of this study?",
  "63242": "Who is going to dress me?",
  "63243": "Think of who?",
  "63244": "What is it you want to distract you?",
  "63245": "Whose beneficence was like his?",
  "63246": "Who taught her?",
  "63247": "It was not he, then, you came to seek?",
  "63248": "Who'll have her?",
  "63249": "Did you speak to him?",
  "63250": "Have you seen fifty frightful men pass down from the cliffs into this forest, my children?",
  "63251": "Will your ladyship stay the night?",
  "63252": "What can he be picking up?",
  "63253": "Then why on earth does she do it?",
  "63254": "How could this be, sir?",
  "63255": "Shall I tell you why?",
  "63256": "What is the day of the month?",
  "63257": "What shall become of me?",
  "63258": "Hasn't she come back yet?",
  "63259": "Well, have you made up your mind to this journey?",
  "63260": "And him you found?",
  "63261": "Did he get his brain fever, and then write all those terrible things, or had he some cause for it all?",
  "63262": "Was she young?",
  "63263": "Cosette?",
  "63264": "Have you seen?",
  "63265": "Where shall we go?",
  "63266": "Or what is this?",
  "63267": "Have you, indeed, my boy?",
  "63268": "Have you seen the general?",
  "63269": "What have you been doing during my absence?",
  "63270": "To you, eh?",
  "63271": "But can the musician by his art make men unmusical?",
  "63272": "Well, and your guardian must be brave if he is to fight well?",
  "63273": "Has my girl any objection?",
  "63274": "Now, when the restriction is removed, what is to prevent it from going still farther?",
  "63275": "But, I say, do you make any progress in it?",
  "63276": "But who should less expect from you?",
  "63277": "Then how d'you know that we have the truth now?",
  "63278": "I would have you consider seriously of it?",
  "63279": "And what money 'ud he want?",
  "63280": "What would you have, sir?",
  "63281": "Were they asleep?",
  "63282": "Yet if he is not the maker, what is he in relation to the bed?",
  "63283": "Of complexion and brown hair?",
  "63284": "Have they contributed to encourage the diligence, and to improve the abilities, of the teachers?",
  "63285": "What about marriage?",
  "63286": "My friend, whom, then, will you serve?",
  "63287": "Did I forbid myself to think of him in any other light than as a paymaster?",
  "63288": "How is it that justice and isolation always accompany each other?",
  "63289": "And how is it to be parried?",
  "63290": "The rabbit?",
  "63291": "What could he have wanted there?",
  "63292": "Rob?",
  "63293": "So there is a hole?",
  "63294": "Why pay rent?",
  "63295": "Should he try to catch her eye, and then raise his hat?",
  "63296": "The first question is, whether music is or is not to make a part of education?",
  "63297": "Will you do me the favor to explain this enigma to me?",
  "63298": "Is there any other point which you would like to ask about?",
  "63299": "The bed might have been let down by some artificial means?",
  "63300": "But what are you up to?",
  "63301": "But what about you, and the rowing?",
  "63302": "Oh, why wasn't somebody kind to her?",
  "63303": "May I have a grill for dinner?",
  "63304": "What need he add to such a desperate proof in figures?",
  "63305": "Did you promise to marry her?",
  "63306": "Did you speculate any more?",
  "63307": "Haven't you your power of attorney?",
  "63308": "What, let me ask, is a man in and of himself?",
  "63309": "Why so much beating about the bush?",
  "63310": "Or am I not to know?",
  "63311": "What does your chamber open on?",
  "63312": "Come to where four roads meet?",
  "63313": "What's this round your neck?",
  "63314": "And which?",

  "63317": "Do you think you can help me, dear grandpapa?",
  "63318": "Why do you sit out here all alone?",
  "63319": "O why was that so?",
  "63320": "You know what they say of my lodger?",
  "63321": "I wonder who 'tis?",
  "63322": "But if he gives you?",
  "63323": "What money is this?",
  "63324": "And would it be indiscreet to ask you the name of this powerful protector?",
  "63325": "I beg your pardon?",
  "63326": "What do you call liberty, monsieur?",
  "63327": "You'll mention that I called, perhaps?",
  "63328": "You notice my ring?",
  "63329": "What revenge?",
  "63330": "Won't you have an egg beaten up in a glass of milk while you're waiting?",
  "63331": "What say ye?",
  "63332": "Against your father?",
  "63333": "Is it all right in the new way?",
  "63334": "Are those horrid creatures gone?",
  "63335": "Why does he then exceed all bounds at once?",
  "63336": "How are you sure?",
  "63337": "Does any one live, who knows what set purposes you have, half as well as I do?",
  "63338": "Could it be that these were four words, and that they were intended to carry a message to me?",
  "63339": "There is nothing you desire?",
  "63340": "Will you let me make the tea?",
  "63341": "What else did he say to you?",
  "63342": "What is there in all that for me to think about?",

  "63353": "What could this NN be?",
  "63354": "And how did he behave, madam?",
  "63355": "How much do you require for my ransom?",
  "63356": "Wouldn't you like him to dribble into the great flood?",
  "63357": "But are your relatives so very poor?",
  "63358": "What is all this dancing up and down?",
  "63359": "If all were only vanity, who would mind it?",
  "63360": "Would I not give my life to secure it?",

  "63379": "Pray, what may that portmanteau of yours weigh?",
  "63380": "You'll be sure to be stirring early and go with us?",
  "63381": "Will it be possible to draw water here tonight?",
  "63382": "Are any of the gallants within?",
  "63383": "Well, then, what do you make of your word AUSTRA?",

  "63390": "Will he succeed in his purpose?",
  "63391": "Oh, how could you act so?",
  "63392": "And yet, he said, the number two is certainly not opposed to the number three?",
  "63393": "No lands neither?",
  "63394": "What were horses made for, if not to drag people uphill?",
  "63395": "In which of your characters, sir, will you give us leave to address you?",
  "63396": "Why have you thrown that away?",
  "63397": "Dead?",
  "63398": "Will you never correct yourself of that vile habit?",
  "63399": "And what did you think, sir, of what I said?",
  "63400": "What, then, it may be asked, is the good of being great?",
  "63401": "I wonder which craft I shall get?",
  "63402": "You promise?",
  "63403": "Not so much as out of bed?",
  "63404": "What's the good of tormenting him like this?",
  "63405": "What do you think of that?",
  "63406": "Can you not do anything you wish?",
  "63407": "But how were you to benefit?",
  "63408": "Rinaldo, why still so pensive?",
  "63409": "What can I do for you?",
  "63410": "What have I done to need his forgiveness?",
  "63411": "And whom I so dearly love?",
  "63412": "Only compatible with letting ME, you mean?",
  "63413": "If so, is he mad?",
  "63414": "How dared he think that he had discovered what so many wiser and clever men had overlooked?",

  "63423": "What work are you about now?",
  "63424": "Would not his hearers add to that sum?",
  "63425": "But passion for him?",
  "63426": "Who is he?",
  "63427": "Does your feminine tyranny require that when you say the thing you mean is one of several things, I should know it immediately by that mark?",
  "63428": "In what condition of mind were you?",
  "63429": "Aren't they pretty?",
  "63430": "Is it like that, dad?",

  "64114": "You do work hard, don't you?",
  "64115": "Have you told them where to find me?",
  "64116": "Doesn't it depend a bit on what she regards as charming?",
  "64117": "Where, then, is the ship?",
  "64118": "I'm not very exacting, am I?",
  "64119": "And in what state of mind has he returned to you?",
  "64120": "Didn't you see the gold with your own two eyes?",
  "64121": "What was it that he did?",
  "64122": "Well, then, tell us frankly, what do you think of her personal appearance?",

  "64132": "Od's precious, come away, man, what do you mean?",
  "64133": "May I go and help carry the things to the poor little children?",
  "64134": "Have heard them say that there is nothing pleasanter than to get rid of their pain?",
  "64135": "Who could see?",
  "64136": "Have you any more to stake?",
  "64137": "What shall you tell her?",
  "64138": "What like is he?",
  "64139": "Is this of envy or no?",
  "64140": "Why, WHY do they torment me and say I am going to marry you?",
  "64141": "If I went to sleep as I proposed, how could the atmosphere in the chamber be regenerated in the interim?",
  "64142": "I suppose you have searched her desk and things?",
  "64143": "I mean can't you put on your own clothes?",
  "64144": "What, after all, was this new oath?",
  "64145": "What then are we to conclude from these facts and considerations?",
  "64146": "How might it fare more gently with you in all the world?",
  "64147": "What avarice?",
  "64148": "Has he gone crazy?",
  "64149": "Hurt me?",
  "64150": "Who's not playing fair?",
  "64151": "They were none of them among our friends at the lodge, then?",
  "64152": "Has it been so kept?",
  "64153": "So you are going away in the fall?",
  "64154": "In the flesh?",
  "64155": "Wouldn't you teach them to play on the piano, and paint on velvet?",

  "64158": "And had he married the valiant matron's daughter, as he promised?",
  "64159": "Everything's made to be played, with and broken, isn't it, young 'un?",
  "64160": "Whatcher take me for, hey?",
  "64161": "What do you mean, the rabbit?",
  "64162": "Now what do you say?",
  "64163": "And what sort of men do they graduate?",
  "64164": "He knew then?",
  "64165": "Why must one read books before he can be considered to have learned?",
  "64166": "What was she insolent about?",

  "64174": "What is the object of this assembly?",
  "64175": "Good heavens, are you ill?",
  "64176": "Well, did you dig up the watch?",
  "64177": "You will arrest him?",
  "64178": "And aren't you?",
  "64179": "What uncanny secret did it hold?",
  "64180": "Why is she thus possessed, and why does she not spare herself?",
  "64181": "But won't you speak to him?",
  "64182": "At any rate, you have some walks in the neighbourhood?",
  "64183": "You have been a soldier?",
  "64184": "But why a year?",
  "64185": "Who's that laughing at me?",
  "64186": "Where, then, would have been her navy, her trade and even her existence?",
  "64187": "What do you hear from your mother?",
  "64188": "How could I settle the point forever?",
  "64189": "What does that spell?",

  "64193": "Is the shepherd said to be just to his sheep and his dogs?",
  "64194": "Why do you keep the secrets of that man, when they mean death to so many?",
  "64195": "But if I pursue and nothing gain, what will it profit me to come up with him?",
  "64196": "Do you wish to get out?",
  "64197": "Clara, are you ready to come home?",
  "64198": "Did you ever hear of such ingratitude?",

  "64206": "What has made you so disobedient and unfaithful?",
  "64207": "You're not in bed?",
  "64208": "What spot?",
  "64209": "Did he believe?",
  "64210": "And now, is this all you have to tell me?",
  "64211": "Could he forego the renown of being the first wit of his age?",
  "64212": "What was he hoping for?",
  "64213": "What name am I to say?",
  "64214": "Elm or fir, both of which abounded in the island?",
  "64215": "And why will they not?",
  "64216": "A new one?",
  "64217": "What if you should die first?",
  "64218": "As day by day the sun sank lower and lower in the sky, could he be certain that the luminary would ever retrace his heavenly road?",
  "64219": "Had they nothing else to say to one another?",
  "64220": "Who told you to steal?",
  "64221": "Did I not tell you how quick and resolute she was?",
  "64222": "Is there any example of an individual object that escaped the government of that law in the whole history of the world?",
  "64223": "Why tarry ye?",
  "64224": "Did he give a reason?",
  "64225": "How did you come here?",
  "64226": "Did I break through one of your rings, that you spread that damned ice on the causeway?",
  "64227": "He asked himself, or were they playing a part?",
  "64228": "Is it true that my mind is only a harmony, and my soul a vortex?",
  "64229": "But if I do fight, you will surely not object to giving me a lesson or two in shooting and fencing?",
  "64230": "Are we women?",
  "64231": "Ah, but it isn't, is it?",
  "64232": "Have you more to say?",
  "64233": "What had really happened?",
  "64234": "How if his death were occasioned by a wound received in defending his master?",
  "64235": "For what is there more prompt, more unexpected, more abbreviatory of space and time, than the maturity of an obligation?",
  "64236": "Would they be right in the future?",
  "64237": "And isn't he?",
  "64238": "And what do you say is your surmise as to your present position?",
  "64239": "Suppose now I ask, why I rather than anybody else?",
  "64240": "If what?",

  "64280": "How did you get this passport?",
  "64281": "The house is sold, then?",
  "64282": "Well, have ye heard the news?",
  "64283": "What kind of person is she?",
  "64284": "Did he hear me?",
  "64285": "You were his constant companion, then?",
  "64286": "Is it not rather an appeal to the proprietory instinct, the COMMERCIAL instinct?",
  "64287": "Is that true, mother?",
  "64288": "How once?",
  "64289": "Wot I say?",
  "64290": "They're a nice lot, ain't they?",
  "64291": "Well, and what does it signify whether it was he or I?",
  "64292": "What formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward?",
  "64293": "Would it be believed, that when near nineteen, any one could be so stupid as to build his hopes of future subsistence on an empty phial?",
  "64294": "For what?",
  "64295": "Is not this absurd?",
  "64296": "Do you know that I am to be beheaded outside this window?",
  "64297": "Eh, who's there?",
  "64298": "How many a year, did you say?",
  "64299": "You intend to show off your intelligence, I suppose?",
  "64300": "Did you want me?",
  "64301": "What are you talking about, man?",
  "64302": "Is it possible that even now, when I give you these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?",
  "64303": "But where were you going, when you met us?",
  "64304": "How do you tink she can be ven you leave her to kill herself so?",

  "66473": "You do not mean to ride, gentlemen?",
  "66474": "May I mention something?",
  "66475": "Why don't you leave me alone?",
  "66476": "You understand how those things are managed?",

  "66503": "Isn't that strange?",
  "66504": "Why cannot man be content to live alone and be happy, and let the women live alone and be happy too?",
  "66505": "Can equality, by the right of succession, be preserved between citizens, as well as between cousins and brothers?",
  "66506": "Ay, and ashamed of it too?",
  "66507": "Cadby's death was from drowning, you say?",

  "66511": "And you?",
  "66512": "Lor, if the devil don't get them, what's he good for?",
  "66513": "Do you think they are dead?",
  "66514": "Has it ever been done before?",
  "66515": "Who's that boy?",
  "66516": "Or do you know some reason why it suits your father's book to amalgamate as well as it suits mine?",
  "66517": "Had you not better light a candle?",
  "66518": "Do you know where he lives?",
  "66519": "Is there ony country where they talk i' that way?",
  "66520": "What did that mean, to kiss?",
  "66521": "And how was she to punish her?",
  "66522": "Tyler appointed him?",
  "66523": "Had the nervous strain resulted in a hallucination, or did the door really move?",
  "66524": "Could she not be brought for just one little instant?",
  "66525": "Can you see me?",
  "66526": "Then to put the question is to solve the problem?",
  "66527": "Can you row up?",
  "66528": "Holding up a bank?",
  "66529": "To meet you in this way, on the sly?",
  "66530": "And what's a sonne?",
  "66531": "What am I to say to him?",
  "66532": "And in the first place, he will honour studies which impress these qualities on his soul and disregard others?",
  "66533": "And you couldn't remember?",
  "66534": "And booted, spurred, and whip in hand, too?",
  "66535": "Would I come and look at it?",
  "66536": "Did you remark the postmarks of those letters?",
  "66537": "Do you see what I meant about the clothes falling off?",
  "66538": "Where is your escort?",
  "66539": "Is it necessary, pray, to illustrate a remark in so practical a style?",
  "66540": "Would he go and describe his rough reception, or recount his exploit?",
  "66541": "What, in the name of everything hideous, did this mean?",
  "66542": "Are you going somewhere?",
  "66543": "Do you know her?",
  "66544": "What can have happened?",
  "66545": "I presume you know, gentlemen, to whom my friend is indebted for this piece of patronage?",
  "66546": "Among them odd heaps of old papers, this gentleman, when he comes into the property, naturally begins to rummage, don't you see?",
  "66547": "Why are you distressed?",
  "66548": "Are you going to have lunch too?",
  "66549": "And what is the means?",
  "66550": "And if I did know them now, what would it avail me?",
  "66551": "What would you have?",
  "66552": "Revels?",
  "66553": "Now will you believe I'm in earnest?",
  "66554": "Is the sun up?",
  "66555": "Oh, what's that?",
  "66556": "Is it the immediate object of this confidence, that you may at once ascertain that, with my knowledge?",
  "66557": "How large was it?",
  "66558": "Then had I not best send him about his business?",
  "66559": "What does it matter?",
  "66560": "Don't your store people trust you?",
  "66561": "Shall we invite him into our hearts?",
  "66562": "What have you done with her, then, if you have her no longer?",
  "66563": "Then you'll not be wanting me any more tonight, ma'am?",
  "66564": "Jane, do you hear that nightingale singing in the wood?",
  "66565": "Where could they be going?",
  "66566": "Won't you?",
  "66567": "Not in regular government pay and employment, to lay traps?",
  "66568": "But who could affirm, who would dare to say, that the amiable fellow did not really see that which his two companions would not see?",
  "66569": "You can't recommend anything for the boy, I suppose?",
  "66570": "What was it that she wanted of him?",
  "66571": "Where are the nearest?",
  "66572": "How has he drawn you to himself?",
  "66573": "Not even of sending me a scrap of stuff for a new dress?",
  "66574": "If he cuts off one of his own toes, or one of his assistants', would you be very much astonished?",
  "66575": "Was the weather hot or cold?",
  "66576": "Where was my baggage?",
  "66577": "Authority?",
  "66578": "Tell him or not tell him?",
  "66579": "O you will let me hold your brave hand, stranger?",
  "66580": "You think so, my lord?",
  "66581": "In your left ear?",
  "66582": "Am I a soothsayer?",
  "66583": "Who shall live up to the great trust?",
  "66584": "Are we there already?",
  "66585": "And my council dares to temper and negotiate?",
  "66586": "How are you?",
  "66587": "But what?",
  "66588": "It was you, was it not?",
  "66589": "Am I not by?",
  "66590": "Have you given up loving her altogether?",
  "66591": "What good does it do?",
  "66592": "You have never heard her nephew play?",
  "66593": "And what is thy want?",
  "66594": "What sin, mademoiselle?",
  "66595": "Or that it is impossible to draw more than one right line betwixt any two points?",
  "66596": "Do you think I could ever skip like that?",
  "66597": "Can you send me to the station?",
  "66598": "When did you leave service?",
  "66599": "Well, what do you think of that?",
  "66600": "What DO you know of him?",
  "66601": "What good will he be to the tribe?",
  "66602": "What, did you come digging here entirely because of me?",
  "66603": "Do you feel that you have lost her?",
  "66604": "What, senor?",
  "66605": "Or the raspberry?",
  "66606": "What is there?",
  "66607": "What have you been after?",
  "66608": "You don't mean to say he stole money, do you?",
  "66609": "But who are all these?",
  "66610": "Well, what d'you think of it?",
  "66611": "Oh, I?",
  "66612": "You couldn't write?",
  "66613": "You here again?",
  "66614": "You have no trouble, I hope, to keep you waking?",
  "66615": "What is, or was, their address?",
  "66616": "But of what disease, then, did she die?",
  "66617": "Trodden upon by whom?",
  "66618": "Mighty men?",
  "66619": "No, but what do you mean?",
  "66620": "Yes, I am out of temper, and do you know why?",
  "66621": "Did you ever hear anything like your brother's eloquence?",
  "66622": "And what is the use of a fellow having a little money if it does not make him independent?",
  "66623": "Why have you no pride?",
  "66624": "Who are you, that you are to play with two young people's affections and break their hearts at your will?",
  "66625": "Yes?",
  "66626": "You mean, will it be prudent?",
  "66627": "What is justice?",
  "66628": "How so?",
  "66629": "Weren't you listening to me?",
  "66630": "What's in it?",
  "66631": "Did he himself find no cause for laughter on the earth?",
  "66632": "And who completed it as it now is?"
