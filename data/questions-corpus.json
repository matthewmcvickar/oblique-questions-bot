  "1312": "Why so fierce?",
  "1313": "For what is it we call a man of birth, but one who is descended from a long succession of rich and powerful ancestors, and who acquires our esteem by his relation to persons whom we esteem?",
  "1314": "Would you mind telling me, so that I can see whether you are not mistaken?",
  "1315": "How are your brains?",
  "1316": "Could any government do more to train the people in the way in which he would have them go?",
  "1317": "After all, what good was this?",
  "1318": "You mean perhaps to be a painter?",
  "1319": "For whom was the first appointment?",
  "1320": "Well, what should I have done?",
  "1321": "Where's my considering cap?",
  "1322": "How did you come by this letter?",
  "1323": "One or other?",
  "1324": "Would he arouse him with a throb of agony?",
  "1325": "But, really, for mercy's sake, prince, what have I done?",
  "1326": "Has anything happened?",
  "1327": "Come up on the tramp?",
  "1328": "What was he doing on the tower?",
  "1329": "What did they contain of pleasure, of happiness, or of grief?",
  "1330": "What do you mean, cousin?",
  "1331": "But then, when you wish to embark, you are obliged to come to the surface of the water?",
  "1332": "What has he in his arms?",
  "1333": "For what now was the first thing you were taught?",
  "1334": "Shall we yield ourselves to him?",
  "1335": "Will you enter, and see my wife?",
  "1336": "Could it then be possible?",
  "1337": "What are these imperious sympathies?",
  "1338": "Could this, too, be a wig?",
  "1339": "Do you consider it an accidental case, prince?",
  "1340": "Will you add these twenty francs to the seven you have?",
  "1341": "And you failed?",
  "1342": "Then you know nothing of the city?",
  "1343": "Was that wise?",
  "1344": "They had a youth with them?",
  "1345": "Were they intelligent mechanisms?",
  "1346": "Are you in a place?",
  "1347": "Warn her?",
  "1348": "Shall we have it up here, or go down to the restaurant?",
  "1349": "And you say that one of your friends lives in that house?",
  "1350": "What does he send me?",
  "1351": "He was only talking to himself, saying 'Over, is it?",
  "1352": "And would not the deficiencies of one year be made up for by the surplus of another?",
  "1353": "I understood, of course, that he saw something, but what?",
  "1354": "Where did you find so many diamonds?",
  "1355": "But tell me, senor, what do you call this excellent and rare adventure that has left us as we are left now?",
  "1356": "Why should you get into such a tantrum about nothing?",
  "1357": "Are you not nearly spent with the heat?",
  "1358": "Do you think you are where you used to be?",
  "1359": "Then the eleventh day must have been a holiday?",
  "1360": "But what can you expect of a creature from the deanery?",
  "1361": "The children?",
  "1362": "You are, doubtless, acquainted with a variety of languages, so as to have been able to read all these?",
  "1363": "What makes you think that?",
  "1364": "Why then are we to believe the same thing of another girl whom we never saw, told by nobody knows who, nor when, nor where?",
  "1365": "Were they going to let him alone this time?",
  "1366": "Had you commissioned me?",
  "1367": "And you remember that we came up with the two in a ditch, and that there was a scuffle between them, and that one of them had been severely handled and much mauled about the face by the other?",
  "1368": "What has the change been?",
  "1369": "And where is the next point?",
  "1370": "It is not such a very dreadful circumstance that we are odd people, is it?",
  "1371": "What says my nephew?",
  "1372": "Who's firing?",
  "1373": "Mamma, are you cross?",
  "1374": "Perhaps you think the poor might have their part?",
  "1375": "Then I am to blow my brains out?",
  "1376": "What is it then, for goodness' sake?",
  "1377": "Poison him?",
  "1378": "And do you hear?",
  "1379": "What shall we do?",
  "1380": "Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?",
  "1381": "What's this paper?",
  "1382": "Then it was to go to her that you left us?",
  "1383": "Are we not endowed with inner force to fight successfully against obstacles and difficulties, and to wrest trophies of glory from hardships?",
  "1384": "Then I am condemned, sire?",
  "1385": "Could he be trying to measure the thickness of the crust of the earth that lay between us and the world above?",
  "1386": "What do you mean to do about this you have seen?",
  "1387": "But your old friends of the musketeers?",
  "1388": "How to get rid of him?",
  "1389": "Each time there had been no sentence of importance which she could relate, and as for the glances and sensations, what woman would reveal them?",
  "1390": "Go and call upon this girl?",
  "1391": "Till he yield to me?",
  "1392": "You're back from leave, I suppose?",
  "1393": "Where are the papers of this prisoner?",
  "1394": "I say, friends, have you heard?",
  "1395": "Well, I said, and how does the change from oligarchy into democracy arise?",
  "1396": "Will you let them come?",
  "1397": "I mean that are not there now?",
  "1398": "Why have they not got rid of him?",
  "1399": "And will you tell me what a gentleman is?",
  "1400": "Were you in love with him?",
  "1401": "Does a woman ever know how much such speeches cost?",
  "1402": "How is this seeming miracle accomplished?",
  "1403": "Do you not humble me if you are too proud to accept what is due to you from my brother?",
  "1404": "Did you have a nice walk?",
  "1405": "Would it not be more like a man to go before his face, and take the satisfaction of a warrior?",
  "1406": "How much does the hire amount to since yesterday?",
  "1407": "Have you heard the password?",
  "1408": "But where are the huts?",
  "1409": "Why should all the parts and organs of many independent beings, each supposed to have been separately created for its proper place in nature, be so invariably linked together by graduated steps?",
  "1410": "What would be the use?",
  "1411": "But how did she become so?",
  "1412": "As before?",
  "1413": "But can the crude fruit of casual observation, never brought to the test of judgment, formed by comparing speculation and experience, deserve such a distinction?",
  "1414": "But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge?",
  "1415": "How can it be foreign?",
  "1416": "Which of your uncles do you like best?",
  "1417": "And what is it to be?",
  "1418": "That we may find it necessary to punish the injury you have done to us?",
  "1419": "Ex tempore?",
  "1420": "Their father is dead?",
  "1421": "Or what is gone with my lords your brethren?",
  "1422": "Well, then, how about the land?",
  "1423": "What business have you at all with these interviews?",
  "1424": "How long was she there?",
  "1425": "But may I regard certain arrangements, which seemed to have been made in conformity with some fixed aim, as the arrangements of design, and look upon them as proceeding from the divine will, with the intervention, however, of certain other particular arrangements disposed to that end?",
  "1426": "A whole bottle?",
  "1427": "Moved?",
  "1428": "Is he not a man of honour and feeling?",
  "1429": "For if we fail in this our fight he must surely win, and then where end we?",
  "1430": "The great question certainly was, what?",
  "1431": "He supposed he was right?",
  "1432": "Is nothing due to the man whom we have all such reason to love, and no reason in the world to think ill of?",
  "1433": "But when you are not sure whether it is a fact or not, what are you to do?",
  "1434": "Would you like to see 'em?",
  "1435": "Which of the two?",
  "1436": "Has either of them confided anything to you by word of mouth?",
  "1437": "Has he ploughed, sowed, reaped, mowed, winnowed, weeded?",
  "1438": "Opposite the scaffold?",
  "1439": "Has anyone gone for the opossum?",
  "1440": "Apiece?",
  "1441": "Monseigneur assures me that the devil has nothing to do with this?",
  "1442": "Well, is it not noble to defend the poets, and introduce to the public all the new scientific and political ideas?",
  "1443": "Is this just?",
  "1444": "But how can you get there?",
  "1445": "Would you help me?",
  "1446": "What right had they to weep over or to talk about her?",
  "1447": "What's he like, this lad?",
  "1448": "What do you think, can a man be suffocated with a wet cloth?",
  "1449": "Is the loin pork enough?",
  "1450": "Put it straight, will you?",
  "1451": "Are you not, comrade?",
  "1452": "How is that, my child?",
  "1453": "And what after that?",
  "1454": "Do you repent of your sins, and do you acknowledge death as a righteous expiation and punishment?",
  "1455": "Shall I serve my child by a lie?",
  "1456": "Hey, who's there?",
  "1457": "How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments?",
  "1458": "Is not death opposed to life?",
  "1459": "And how much will that pair of stockings be worth when she has finished them?",
  "1460": "Grimaud, why did you not tell me this?",
  "1461": "My superintendent would not find me any money?",
  "1462": "How came it yours?",
  "1463": "Besides, who is to choose the velvet and cut for this young dandy?",
  "1464": "Who wants a protector?",
  "1465": "ARE they memorials?",
  "1466": "Exactly of what else could a platform consist?",
  "1467": "Why are you making knots in that ribbon, and writing invisible characters on the floor with the point of that busy little foot?",
  "1468": "Of my own life?",
  "1469": "What do these sounds portend?",
  "1470": "And who knows it?",
  "1471": "Can you do it?",
  "1472": "Or are you going to keep it right alongside of us outrageous fellows?",
  "1473": "You consider that to be important?",
  "1474": "Should I?",
  "1475": "Has he, ma'am?",
  "1476": "What precaution?",
  "1477": "On his track?",
  "1478": "Was not he disguised?",
  "1479": "And the quilting of the stairs no where worn out, and bare?",
  "1480": "What have you there?",
  "1481": "You go back and watch that long, will you?",
  "1482": "Will they abandon them in misfortune?",
  "1483": "What, then, will you say?",
  "1484": "Why, is it hid all around?",
  "1485": "You think love is the ticket, do you?",
  "1486": "Old or young?",
  "1487": "Has no copy been taken?",
  "1488": "Do you love him, love him with all your heart and soul, with all the love your bosom can feel?",
  "1489": "And how do you feel about it?",
  "1490": "What are fireworks like?",
  "1491": "Whom am I and what am I?",
  "1492": "Oh, why had she sent her letter?",
  "1493": "Do you conceive me, gentlemen?",
  "1494": "To what, ma'am?",
  "1495": "But how much truth was behind it?",
  "1496": "What does it contain?",
  "1497": "Why should it break three inches from the top, as this one has done?",
  "1498": "Was it last evening that you came on board this vessel?",
  "1499": "And why not a bowl of rack punch as well as any other cause?",
  "1500": "Would it be some young man or other whom she takes an interest in?",
  "1501": "Is it absolutely necessary to go on with the letter, darling?",
  "1502": "Is that a genuine letter you are reading?",
  "1503": "What could be better?",
  "1504": "What has she been telling you?",
  "1505": "Why is that little, and the little freedom they enjoy, to be infringed?",
  "1506": "Had I been remanded to my dungeon, to await the next sacrifice, which would not take place for many months?",
  "1507": "Will she recover?",
  "1508": "Is that what you mean?",
  "1509": "But now that virtue has become to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into bitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy?",
  "1510": "What do you mean by going with other men, anyway?",
  "1511": "What would be the end?",
  "1512": "Feelin' sick?",
  "1513": "Determine on what?",
  "1514": "And yet what?",
  "1515": "Why risk the world's great empire for a punk?",
  "1516": "You mean, spend too much money?",
  "1517": "Nose and all?",
  "1518": "And will you answer it?",
  "1519": "How, then, will competition be harmoniously determined in society?",
  "1520": "Have I got to drink that stuff?",
  "1521": "Ruined her?",
  "1522": "So that I need not make use of this petition?",
  "1523": "But what do you conclude from that, father?",
  "1524": "What took place?",
  "1525": "Will you give your honour not to fire while we talk?",
  "1526": "What's the use of that?",
  "1527": "What's fame?",
  "1528": "Where would be the use of it?",
  "1529": "My purpose, for why should I deny it?",
  "1530": "Do you contradict me?",
  "1531": "What makes you so smitten with that little vermin?",
  "1532": "But how did you get in here?",
  "1533": "Where was the man flying to after such dreadful retaliation?",
  "1534": "Why not still proceed over the untamed yet obedient element?",
  "1535": "For, suppose the manufacturer, who seems to make this profit on his property, wishes also to make it on his merchandise, can he then pay himself one franc for that which cost him ninety centimes, and make money by the operation?",
  "1536": "Why then has he never taken part in public affairs?",
  "1537": "From that woman?",
  "1538": "Does not every merchant have his secret mark?",
  "1539": "And that others should approve of what we approve, is no miracle or impossibility?",
  "1540": "He will be a baronet, will he not?",
  "1541": "To what purpose?",
  "1542": "Can you pray?",
  "1543": "And can his majesty count upon many such subjects as yourself for his flight?",
  "1544": "What became of him?",
  "1545": "How many arms have you there ready for distribution?",
  "1546": "Will you come and see me?",
  "1547": "What makes you suppose I know?",
  "1548": "But what am I to do with the brute?",
  "1549": "What nonsense is this?",
  "1550": "Where was she now?",
  "1551": "How do you explain the influence the count evidently possessed over those ruffians?",
  "1552": "What is the idea of you buying a fox skin, you poor beggar?",
  "1553": "Lost confidence?",
  "1554": "How could he have chosen a better friend in whom to trust?",
  "1555": "In the same way?",
  "1556": "What was your remark, my dear friend?",
  "1557": "Why do you answer me so roughly?",
  "1558": "What's going to become of us now?",
  "1559": "And what will the be the good of your going on after that?",
  "1560": "Is it right?",
  "1561": "Be terrorized by every prating paper?",
  "1562": "Are many of the young ladies with you?",
  "1563": "Oh, she thinks me too meek?",
  "1564": "Sparking plugs, eh?",
  "1565": "Was he alone, that long night, whose brave, loving spirit was bearing up, in that old shed, against buffeting and brutal stripes?",
  "1566": "I am out of all that, am I not?",
  "1567": "Have there not been religions indisputably on a moral level lower than that of the community which they represent?",
  "1568": "What are you going to do next?",
  "1569": "Who was her father?",
  "1570": "In fact, has ANYTHING ever been done by government for the interest of the private settler?",
  "1571": "And what is human omnipotence?",
  "1572": "So you have brought him thither from the barricade?",
  "1573": "But what would you say of equal portions of wood and stone, or other material equals?",
  "1574": "Have I anything to pay?",
  "1575": "Do they think to have to do with a ninnywhoop, to feed you thus with cakes?",
  "1576": "Is it at the city of the stones or in the garden of the palms?",
  "1577": "What the devil are you waiting for?",
  "1578": "I suppose that none of these securities have been found among the property of the dead man?",
  "1579": "Chance?",
  "1580": "Oh, you want a knife?",
  "1581": "But who will distribute these things?",
  "1582": "Who wrote the letter?",
  "1583": "I suppose that you would know him when you saw him?",
  "1584": "Then, under the influence either of poverty or of wealth, workmen and their work are equally liable to degenerate?",
  "1585": "Are there any newspapers now?",
  "1586": "Who is that other person?",
  "1587": "Was she not horribly bedizened with velvet and pearls, with velvet and pearls, too, which had been torn off her back?",
  "1588": "Why should you have?",
  "1589": "What would you do yourself?",
  "1590": "How do you mean, forgotten?",
  "1591": "D'Imfreville?",
  "1592": "To get more knocks?",
  "1593": "Could it be possible, he continued, that eyes which as they gazed never expressed any divergence from what the tongue was telling, were yet ever seeing another world behind her ostensible one, discordant and contrasting?",
  "1594": "Hulloa, where have you sprung from?",
  "1595": "What can I say?",
  "1596": "But what can we do with him?",
  "1597": "To encourage him to continue poaching?",
  "1598": "Then why do people go there?",
  "1599": "Does any one scruple, in extraordinary cases, to violate all regard to the private property of individuals, and sacrifice to public interest a distinction which had been established for the sake of that interest?",
  "1600": "If the profits has turned out to be none, lackin' considable, and none to carry, is it my fault any more'n it's yourn?",
  "1601": "Lily, will you be mine?",
  "1602": "How can it be?",
  "1603": "Do you reckon you can learn me?",
  "1604": "What do you want to do?",
  "1605": "Might I have a buttonhole first?",
  "1606": "Come, be a good boy, what's her name?",
  "1607": "My sister stolen away?",

  "2142": "Surely there is no necessity for you to say one word, mama?",
  "2143": "That's eight months she has been away, surely?",
  "2144": "Who shall go in?",
  "2145": "Will you sell them for five francs?",
  "2146": "Why negotiate, and above all why retreat, when to retreat is so contrary to his method of conducting war?",
  "2147": "You wanted to speak to her?",
  "2148": "But am I not your nearest relative?",
  "2149": "Then what do you think, mother, has become of 'em?",
  "2150": "You have written to your father?",
  "2151": "Ought it not?",
  "2152": "Did he tell you so himself?",
  "2153": "The ladies are great observers, sir?",
  "2154": "Are you come to do anything in my way, sir?",
  "2155": "Have you honours?",
  "2156": "Suppose, now, I could give you up to a rich man who would be able to insure you against all wants?",

  "2190": "Am I not to know to whom to present it?",
  "2191": "I say, madam, what do you propose to do with these papers?",
  "2192": "Are we ready?",
  "2193": "Have you any better explanation?",
  "2194": "Who was it gave me that rogues' march from the stocks to the gallows's foot?",

  "2202": "At this last moment I ask you, have we not long been betrothed to each other in our secret hearts?",
  "2203": "When did this happen?",
  "2204": "Something about somebody laughing at a locksmith?",
  "2205": "For what are you fighting?",
  "2206": "And that is adding insult to injury, is it?",

  "2252": "And what was his purpose?",
  "2253": "Ah, you know it?",
  "2254": "But with a beard, you tell me?",
  "2255": "But, on the other hand, whose blood was that which lay so thickly upon the floor?",
  "2256": "Well, what did you see, sir, or think you saw?",
  "2257": "What was taking place within him?",
  "2258": "What did you force me to run away with you for?",
  "2259": "Besides, can any one be afraid of a war abroad, and that with such as will have comparatively much greater moderation than our own people have?",
  "2260": "Did I groan all right?",
  "2261": "Known what?",
  "2262": "You, my poor child, suffer poverty and hunger?",
  "2263": "Was it by his extensive knowledge, by his exquisite judgment, or by his heroic valour?",
  "2264": "Whose language would he speak?",
  "2265": "Perhaps you would care to try?",

  "2390": "I suppose you've made pretty speeches to a girl before now?",
  "2391": "What was this ruffian religiously absorbed in the adoration of a virgin, watching over her, rearing her, guarding her, dignifying her, and enveloping her, impure as he was himself, with purity?",
  "2392": "How much did the girl receive?",
  "2393": "Why an I interrupted when I am engaged on business?",

  "4606": "What's the matter with you girls?",
  "4607": "Then why do they quarrel?",
  "4608": "Can we then for a moment believe that, if this had been so, tradition would have been absolutely silent on the matter?",
  "4609": "Is the power of declaring war necessary?",
  "4610": "Even if he enjoys peace and a truce with you and all your men, what matters that to me?",
  "4611": "The last governess?",
  "4612": "I wonder if that will have a good effect?",
  "4613": "What horrible place are we in?",
  "4614": "Then there is no revenge?",
  "4615": "Do you imagine such a thing?",
  "4616": "You will do for me what you have done for the queen?",
  "4617": "Have you lived with the family long?",
  "4618": "Want to break up the line?",
  "4619": "Mercy, did you say?",
  "4620": "How is SHE?",
  "4621": "You saw me, perhaps, on the night of the convict hunt, when I was so imprudent as to allow the moon to rise behind me?",
  "4622": "Where are the gloves?",
  "4623": "Am I to understand that you say you love me?",
  "4624": "Is that clear?",
  "4625": "How be ye?",
  "4626": "Ah, by my crown, what's that?",
  "4627": "Are you glad to see me?",
  "4628": "What is our life but the very worst life?",
  "4629": "Well, what is to be done?",
  "4630": "Badly made up?",
  "4631": "What would happen?",
  "4632": "But, once more, how is that my fault?",
  "4633": "Until now?",
  "4634": "Is he an old offender?",
  "4635": "Which of these do we take?",
  "4636": "What old cove?",
  "4637": "Do you want us to fling ourselves headlong down these rocks?",

  "4640": "In what figure shall I give his heart the first impression?",
  "4641": "The inquiry being only into the circumstances touching the death of the deceased, it's not necessary to go beyond these facts, I suppose you'll agree?",
  "4642": "Have you knocked at that one?",
  "4643": "Today, this moment?",
  "4644": "Or had he in reality always been like this, commonplace and prosaic, and was it merely in her imagination that he had been wonderful?",
  "4645": "Have you only just come?",
  "4646": "What man?",
  "4647": "Why do the women wear these things?",
  "4648": "Given the laboratories, how are the investigators to be maintained?",
  "4649": "All ready there?",
  "4650": "Why should we not leave together?",
  "4651": "What did you do then, sir?",
  "4652": "What was the ebb and flow of this tragic meditation?",
  "4653": "Then you want me to go back there?",
  "4654": "But do they do right in ignoring the existence of violence and bloodshed in resistance to constituted authority?",
  "4655": "Harness, but how can I harness everything?",
  "4656": "How cruel is your goodness?",
  "4657": "But what good will it do?",
  "4658": "What will protect him?",
  "4659": "How can I be sure of this?",
  "4660": "What's death?",
  "4661": "What was amiss?",
  "4662": "Where are you going to dine then?",
  "4663": "What could you do?",
  "4664": "If he could not do it, and if, nevertheless, it behoved them to break off this match, by whom was it to be done if not by her?",
  "4665": "A monkey, then?",
  "4666": "Have you any idea who did?",
  "4667": "Who made the lemonade?",
  "4668": "How shall he stop all the holes and deliver himself from the vipers?",
  "4669": "And why should that particular hole in the ground have anything to do with it?",
  "4670": "Why did the doctor's wife give the clerk presents?",
  "4671": "Am I doing anything?",
  "4672": "What did you think?",
  "4673": "Is it all you expected of it?",
  "4674": "What is it that you know?",
  "4675": "Do you not think so?",
  "4676": "Is, then, the crown too heavy that I wear?",
  "4677": "Does he want to protect himself, or does he think I would not go alone?",
  "4678": "Has law and order come down to this?",
  "4679": "And have you had a good bonfire up there?",

  "4681": "What do we want of a saw?",
  "4682": "Shall I sew, read, cone, draw, or do all at once?",
  "4683": "How call you the fountain?",
  "4684": "Yea?",
  "4685": "Who would be left?",
  "4686": "And, if so, how far into the future should we look?",
  "4687": "You have seen inside, then?",
  "4688": "And what did I do?",
  "4689": "What good will it do?",
  "4690": "Would you let me fetch another pat of butter, ma'am?",
  "4691": "Where's some brandy?",
  "4692": "Do you think he'll do it?",
  "4693": "Or will a not fail when he does come?",
  "4694": "Has there been any mistake, has she been buried alive?",
  "4695": "Yes, why was it that he had not married?",
  "4696": "Have I not indeed been living in a dream?",
  "4697": "But you, my poor child?",
  "4698": "Who could resist the pleading of so wise and compassionate a judge?",
  "4699": "How long are you staying?",
  "4700": "What on earth is the matter with the boy?",
  "4701": "I said just now, what good could come of it?",
  "4702": "May be a fraud?",
  "4703": "What's an engagement made of, do you suppose?",
  "4704": "I suppose you will be glad of variety and admiration?",
  "4705": "Do you think you can recover your lord by giving away thus to your grief?",
  "4706": "But where is the use?",
  "4707": "You're not going?",
  "4708": "With no work to do, nobody to worry us, and nobody to compete with?",
  "4709": "I know I've had it a long time, but where did I get it?",
  "4710": "Is she alone?",
  "4711": "What had taken place during this long sleep?",
  "4712": "When, finally, he was graduated a captain as well as a soldier, to what object should he address his efforts?",
  "4713": "Am I, or am I not, the queen?",

  "4717": "Now, then, mum?",
  "4718": "Who by?",
  "4719": "How can they laugh, or even live at all here?",
  "4720": "Who came here the last time?",
  "4721": "But what color can the objection have, when a specification of the objects alluded to by these general terms immediately follows, and is not even separated by a longer pause than a semicolon?",
  "4722": "What about poaching eggs?",
  "4723": "You know not the subject of their conversation?",
  "4724": "You would not fight a duel?",
  "4725": "Worth it, the little sacrifice, for whom?",
  "4726": "Is my son dead or unhorsed or so wounded that he cannot help himself?",
  "4727": "What about those rings you told me of?",
  "4728": "Little bamboos that creak together, tell me where he ran?",
  "4729": "Want a pilot, captain?",
  "4730": "There, what do you think now of the affair?",
  "4731": "Was there anything in your letter which might have unbalanced him or induced him to take such a step?",
  "4732": "How long was I what they called out of my senses?",
  "4733": "I am having a great holiday, am I not?",
  "4734": "In what strain should he do so?",
  "4735": "What was their case?",
  "4736": "Was your sister dressed?",
  "4737": "Where has he gone?",
  "4738": "What does it signify?",
  "4739": "And what did he do the rest of his time?",
  "4740": "What do you mean, then?",
  "4741": "You're not angry that I sent for you?",
  "4742": "Might I have a word with your lordship?",
  "4743": "But what had been in the box?",
  "4744": "May I prove my gratitude by explaining for once where my difficulty lies?",
  "4745": "And do you suppose, madam, that he would have no money left?",
  "4746": "Do you not see that all these soldiers of ours have been raised by us to the pitch of expectation?",
  "4747": "I afraid?",
  "4748": "Did you ever love such an one?",
  "4749": "And will the head's being bare cure the madness of yours?",
  "4750": "Is it worth while?",
  "4751": "Will you be good enough to come and see me?",
  "4752": "She is ready, is she?",
  "4753": "From whom else could they come?",
  "4754": "You do not need that name in order to live?",
  "4755": "What has he done?",
  "4756": "Have you done this?",
  "4757": "Was he one of those two passengers?",
  "4758": "What is to become of us?",
  "4759": "Give every one their due, eh?",
  "4760": "What stone wall?",
  "4761": "How could I adore her more if I were married to one of the people you speak of?",
  "4762": "Do you think so?",
  "4763": "By what oaths can he bind himself?",
  "4764": "Will monseigneur have the kindness to say for what purpose?",
  "4765": "Of what burden is she?",
  "4766": "Do I amuse you?",
  "4767": "Come, is that enough, mamma, or do you intend to put any more questions?",
  "4768": "A lost art?",
  "4769": "Are you one of his men?",
  "4770": "Criminals?",
  "4771": "Who was the he?",
  "4772": "Why did you wish to stop my ears?",
  "4773": "Have you forgiven me?",
  "4774": "Will you refuse to do as I wish?",
  "4775": "Well, what did he talk about with you?",
  "4776": "Where is the forest man who went to rescue you?",
  "4777": "And what is the time limit for such reactions?",
  "4778": "But if, in the dawn of life, we could soberly survey the scenes before us as in perspective, and see every thing in its true colours, how could the passions gain sufficient strength to unfold the faculties?",
  "4779": "Will you not speak to me?",
  "4780": "What hour?",
  "4781": "What has brought him here at this time?",
  "4782": "I think I saw you in the park riding?",
  "4783": "Are we not?",
  "4784": "Why should love be a bond?",
  "4785": "And if you found him deserting to your enemies, what would you do?",
  "4786": "Who could have told you that?",
  "4787": "Why do we not arrive?",
  "4788": "Then, after all, it was given to me by the dean?",
  "4789": "May I have her at my party?",
  "4790": "But who said it was buried alive?",
  "4791": "May I call tomorrow?",
  "4792": "What was that?",
  "4793": "My wish?",
  "4794": "What's to do naow?",
  "4795": "I ask you, sir, how dare you do it?",
  "4796": "What have you gained?",
  "4797": "How have we handled our national finances?",
  "4798": "But if he be willing to accept my offers, will you oppose them?",
  "4799": "The next question of anxiety was, where would the balloon alight?",
  "4800": "She?",
  "4801": "How could you sing, sing like that while crying?",
  "4802": "My line?",
  "4803": "But will it hurt me?",
  "4804": "So you want to marry?",
  "4805": "How is that, my friend?",
  "4806": "Can destiny, then, be as malicious as an intelligent being, and become as monstrous as the human heart?",
  "4807": "What difference does that make?",
  "4808": "Would you be able to recognize that man again?",
  "4809": "And who the devil gave YOU leave to touch a stick about the place?",
  "4810": "You supposed he should have hung himself indeed?",
  "4811": "Of what kind were they?",
  "4812": "Have you a brother?",
  "4813": "Can you tell how?",
  "4814": "What the devil do you come in between me and my dog for?",
  "4815": "Did you see?",
  "4816": "I presume then that you are going to make one of the interdicted answers?",
  "4817": "And I?",
  "4818": "And good counsel is clearly a kind of knowledge, for not by ignorance, but by knowledge, do men counsel well?",
  "4819": "Do you understand me?",
  "4820": "Have not almost all the governments in the world always been in the wrong on religious subjects?",
  "4821": "Why do you make so much noise?",
  "4822": "Against whom?",
  "4823": "What was to be done in the rural districts?",
  "4824": "Ah, how many inhabitants could it support?",
  "4825": "And which to the mortal?",
  "4826": "But what do you make of the grandmother?",
  "4827": "How have we offended?",
  "4828": "And what about her?",
  "4829": "What business have you here?",
  "4830": "Is it just?",
  "4831": "What is that you say, my friend?",
  "4832": "Do you really?",
  "4833": "But what sort of a man was he?",
  "4834": "No use?",
  "4835": "Your real name you will not give?",
  "4836": "Has he not compounded a riddle, thinking to try me?",
  "4837": "And what shall we say about men?",
  "4838": "Have you no shame?",
  "4839": "Why weep you not to think upon my wrongs?",
  "4840": "Stranger, what is it?",
  "4841": "What shall I suffer and endure?",
  "4842": "Maybe you'll be very lonely, ma'am?",
  "4843": "What is it, little girl?",
  "4844": "But may not the tradition of it have descended from the discovery of comparatively late remains, by primitive man, of the winged saurians that crawled, swam, dived, or flew, lingering on till the later geologic period?",
  "4845": "The lady, sir?",
  "4846": "Oats?",
  "4847": "How long could they keep the pace?",
  "4848": "His uncle had deceived him, and might he not consign her to some miserable place where her youth and beauty would prove a far greater curse than ugliness and decrepitude?",
  "4849": "Who do you wish to see?",
  "4850": "How long is this for?",
  "4851": "What conceivable motive had they for doing so?",
  "4852": "Which way is the business part?",
  "4853": "And dressed?",
  "4854": "Why, cousin?",
  "4855": "Make you feel rotten?",
  "4856": "Do I ever take pains to have any secrets?",
  "4857": "Did you ever see her?",
  "4858": "How do you like my entrance?",
  "4859": "Can you rest here?",
  "4860": "Cruel?",
  "4861": "Will you never do anything?",
  "4862": "Beneath it?",
  "4863": "Is such a thing possible?",
  "4864": "Sorry for whom?",
  "4865": "Your leagues concluded, your engagements past?",
  "4866": "Why does he not come himself?",
  "4867": "Is anything the matter?",
  "4868": "Of what misdemeanor do you accuse him?",
  "4869": "And who did it?",
  "4870": "Only think what you are giving up here?",
  "4871": "And what would you call her?",
  "4872": "The boy is out, you say?",
  "4873": "What can make her amends for this privation, or where is she to seek for a fresh employment?",
  "4874": "But what's the southern army to do?",
  "4875": "What was passing in that brain, so loaded with dreadful secrets?",
  "4876": "Are you sure she said that?",
  "4877": "I do not know whether you have heard the whole story?",
  "4878": "How near were you?",
  "4879": "Surprise?",
  "4880": "And why should you object?",
  "4881": "But what are men?",
  "4882": "It that noble?",
  "4883": "Oh, what shall I call you?",
  "4884": "Will you come out with me again one evening?",
  "4885": "Then who is supporting you there?",
  "4886": "What is the difference, then, between the two customs?",
  "4887": "I wonder, captain, what they will say of my going away, ha?",
  "4888": "In such a world as this, what is the use of the enjoyment of pleasures, if he who has fed on them is to return to this world again and again?",
  "4889": "Why did you introduce a defective bill?",
  "4890": "And why then have you tempted me?",
  "4891": "And his name?",
  "4892": "Did he get well?",
  "4893": "Lend me a hanky, will you?",
  "4894": "Would you know how to buy it, my darling?",
  "4895": "When the tongue of an advocate once gets in motion, who can tell where it will stop?",
  "4896": "What was this?",
  "4897": "Is there any enjoyment in it, if his opinion is that he is aggrieved?",

  "4899": "Of what consequence?",
  "4900": "Would you like me to get out the books now that your grandmother is going to give you for your birthday?",
  "4901": "What is it, then?",
  "4902": "Well, how are you?",
  "4903": "You've come back, have you?",
  "4904": "Now, if I grant that they cannot be employed in the sphere of experience, as constitutive principles, how shall I secure for them employment and objective validity as regulative principles, and in what way can they be so employed?",
  "4905": "How long have you had that cough ?",
  "4906": "Would you turn their distress into a malediction?",
  "4907": "Of what did the plebeians complain?",
  "4908": "Giry, do you know what is in this envelope?",
  "4909": "Are you sure of this?",
  "4910": "Or five?",
  "4911": "But how about the wine?",
  "4912": "Must I go in immediately?",
  "4913": "BROWN?",
  "4914": "See, now, my jealous lord, do I address such questions to you?",
  "4915": "What are laborers in relation to each other?",
  "4916": "What scoundrel struck that blow?",
  "4917": "I mean, would you have wished to paint her?",
  "4918": "You receive stolen goods, do you?",
  "4919": "What had he, a family man, to do with ventures beyond sea?",
  "4920": "Will you please tell him that a lady wishes to see him?",
  "4921": "A wa'at for me?",
  "4922": "Was there enough ice?",
  "4923": "But where will they lead us to?",
  "4924": "A fright?",
  "4925": "How can I help that, my boy?",
  "4926": "Can you have become untrue to your own heart?",
  "4927": "How then, sir, can I act, but by shewing my abhorrence of every step that makes towards my undoing?",
  "4928": "And you will not turn aside as you did just now?",
  "4929": "How is it?",
  "4930": "Said he, what's the matter?",
  "4931": "And was it not the manly thing for him to do?",
  "4932": "Was that kind?",
  "4933": "Is ever disaster nearer than when each solider thinks about his private safety only?",
  "4934": "Are you all clear, you, aft there?",
  "4935": "That is perhaps true, but what of it?",
  "4936": "Where may he be at present?",
  "4937": "Menneville, what do you want to do?",
  "4938": "But this coffer?",
  "4939": "The main question is, which of the two parents is more to be had in honour?",
  "4940": "We were too rich, were we?",
  "4941": "Are we not bound to carry our investigations to extremity?",
  "4942": "Can you read?",
  "4943": "What were we the worse for the former folly?",
  "4944": "Could I speak to you alone for a moment?",
  "4945": "Oh, you're the new articled clerk?",
  "4946": "What right thing?",
  "4947": "Stendhal?",
  "4948": "Will you go?",
  "4949": "Why, then, do you fear them?",
  "4950": "O how shall I know this?",
  "4951": "You want to see who they are?",
  "4952": "What stayed them?",
  "4953": "And I've got a tremendous will, have I?",
  "4954": "Oh, something in a philanthropic way?",
  "4955": "Oh, but how was it?",
  "4956": "But where are we drifting?",
  "4957": "But what were our managers doing?",
  "4958": "You are come to tell us it is time to be gone, have you not?",
  "4959": "Was the man a magician?",
  "4960": "Her brother?",
  "4961": "Do you not see what feigned prices, are set upon little stones and rarities?",
  "4962": "What, are there any greater still?",
  "4963": "Is she your cousin?",
  "4964": "What mystery could be hidden under this sign?",
  "4965": "To the cottage of her sister?",
  "4966": "A pipe ?",
  "4967": "Do I delight to die, or life desire?",
  "4968": "Why are you in low spirits?",
  "4969": "And you will leave me then?",
  "4970": "Was it an illusion, a mistake, an optical illusion?",
  "4971": "What principle of good faith, then, was violated?",
  "4972": "Looking toward our house?",
  "4973": "Will you be quiet, then?",
  "4974": "Who am I?",
  "4975": "Is it for you, who keep an inn, to treat passengers at this rate?",
  "4976": "And did you see him?",
  "4977": "Supposing, for instance, that they should suddenly hail a taxi?",
  "4978": "Have you anything interesting there?",
  "4979": "And you found yourselves suddenly on a mountain side?",
  "4980": "Why do you ever come back, then, at all?",
  "4981": "Will that be all?",
  "4982": "But what did I want crawling forward to scorch my understanding at her flaming brow?",
  "4983": "But if there were somewhere a being strong and beautiful, a valiant nature, full at once of exaltation and refinement, a poet's heart in an angel's form, a lyre with sounding chords ringing out elegiac epithalamia to heaven, why, perchance, should she not find him?",
  "4984": "You have only lately arrived?",
  "4985": "I shall have the comte's letter in eight hours?",
  "4986": "How can we with mortal eyes contemplate this image, whose celestial splendor the host of heaven presumes not to behold?",
  "4987": "How can it affect them?",
  "4988": "Ever seen one like it?",
  "4989": "How have I done what I have done?",
  "4990": "Do you see that bath behind you?",

  "4993": "What length was it?",
  "4994": "What are we all miserable for, when everything might be so happy?",
  "4995": "What did he say to me?",
  "4996": "I'm afraid you are ill?",
  "4997": "Why should she have been less prone to love than he was?",
  "4998": "In what time?",
  "4999": "How was it known that these letters were from me?",
  "5000": "Surely I never led you to expect such a thing?",
  "5001": "And is he aware of the danger he has been in?",
  "5002": "But why had his father taken up the board?",
  "5003": "What has become of him?",
  "5004": "And are not your own very lives in my hands?",
  "5005": "But we shall see you soon again, shall we not?",
  "5006": "I missed again?",
  "5007": "Am I boring you with all this?",
  "5008": "Are they, do you think?",
  "5009": "Do you realize that it's all your fault?",
  "5010": "My dear fellow, how are you?",
  "5011": "What does he appear to be?",
  "5012": "What were you doing?",
  "5013": "What is the relative age of this hymn?",
  "5014": "But if your honor knew this man?",
  "5015": "Do you think the lemon juice did any good?",
  "5016": "Am I to believe that?",
  "5017": "But your writing?",
  "5018": "Well, do you hear, sirrah?",
  "5019": "Was it in this room that you gave your instructions as to the copying of the document?",
  "5020": "How comes it that a true and cordial fraternity has not arrested on the one side and on the other the effects of pride and labor?",
  "5021": "What do you mean, sir?",
  "5022": "Do you wish this to live?",
  "5023": "What more can they pretend?",
  "5024": "Has anything escaped me?",
  "5025": "Ever kicked downstairs?",
  "5026": "Is it possible to abolish property in land in our age?",
  "5027": "Now how in the world did it get here?",
  "5028": "And what will you say to him, beloved?",
  "5029": "Then the just is happy, and the unjust miserable?",
  "5030": "In favour of the temperate men?",
  "5031": "Why not like that?",
  "5032": "Did you not hear me?",
  "5033": "Indeed, how can he, when they but follow his own vile example?",
  "5034": "Now, what must we conclude with respect to such sexual differences as these?",
  "5035": "What boots it singing on?",
  "5036": "Why do you start and look pale at my words?",
  "5037": "Cannot I serve you as a waiting maid?",
  "5038": "Was it mere fancy?",
  "5039": "Were you not saying that he too makes, not the idea which, according to our view, is the essence of the bed, but only a particular bed?",
  "5040": "Why, what are they thinking upon, sir?",
  "5041": "Shall we go forward?",
  "5042": "I suppose you quite agree with them, prince?",
  "5043": "Am I not right?",
  "5044": "And after the police?",
  "5045": "Have you a place you would like to put him in?",
  "5046": "Well, then, how am I free?",
  "5047": "A mere drudge?",
  "5048": "And who put the torpedo there?",
  "5049": "This is the triumph I was to have, is it?",
  "5050": "What new conditions?",
  "5051": "Are we wrong?",
  "5052": "How can we help loving and dwelling upon its recollections?",
  "5053": "Do you not know him?",
  "5054": "My good sir, is this man a hero, or a criminal?",
  "5055": "You would not change your lot for that of a king?",
  "5056": "Well, you will not tell us?",
  "5057": "She could hardly believe as much, but why did he not write?",
  "5058": "If so, state all he said, as nearly as you can?",
  "5059": "Would you like to see him?",
  "5060": "Or did they interpret our spurts of fire, the sudden stinging of our shells, our steady investment of their encampment, as we should the furious unanimity of onslaught in a disturbed hive of bees?",
  "5061": "And how are you?",
  "5062": "Why send it away?",
  "5063": "What's the hurry?",
  "5064": "How should you know that?",
  "5065": "Very handsome still?",
  "5066": "Would you like to see a little of it?",
  "5067": "May I presume to ask whether you have long possessed it?",
  "5068": "Well, waiving that, as she is nothing to me, and virtuously married to another man, why should she come troubling us?",
  "5069": "And what on earth are you going to do with it?",
  "5070": "Why so hard?",
  "5071": "Have they loved me?",
  "5072": "Ah, but you mean here, at your own home?",
  "5073": "How am I to get in?",
  "5074": "Then he who is a good keeper of anything is also a good thief?",
  "5075": "Will you ask him what kind was his son?",
  "5076": "Ey?",
  "5077": "The one in blue?",
  "5078": "Lordy, what did you do?",
  "5079": "So you'll not tell, will you?",
  "5080": "Why did he not bring it to me here?",
  "5081": "What is all that noise?",
  "5082": "Has he escaped?",
  "5083": "Have you got him?",
  "5084": "Has he a mother?",
  "5085": "Would he carry him on with him?",
  "5086": "You mean that you think there was no accident?",
  "5087": "Why, dear?",
  "5088": "How badly?",
  "5089": "Why should he not go to the home of his fathers?",
  "5090": "Is that all he does?",
  "5091": "Ah, where in the world have there been greater follies than with the pitiful?",
  "5092": "But what is the latest news of him?",
  "5093": "You know we want some help in the servant staff of the hospital?",
  "5094": "Of money?",
  "5095": "Who will plant the flag on the barricade again?",
  "5096": "Was the fire wholly extinct there?",
  "5097": "Why did you originally go away from me?",
  "5098": "How did this come about?",
  "5099": "What do I know about arms or supports?",
  "5100": "What does she make a sham for, and pretend to give me money, and take it away again?",
  "5101": "And was this conference arranged beforehand?",
  "5102": "Yet, to show my ingenuity rather than wit, would not a less model have given a full representation of that subject, not by diminution but by contraction of parts?",
  "5103": "Wherefore should I hold, good fellow?",
  "5104": "What have you done with your fur?",
  "5105": "Is not that true?",
  "5106": "And do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to her daughters, than to us?",
  "5107": "But why must I promise that?",
  "5108": "And what do you know?",
  "5109": "Will you have it so, or will you share your lover's punishment?",
  "5110": "How could a readiness for war in time of peace be safely prohibited, unless we could prohibit, in like manner, the preparations and establishments of every hostile nation?",
  "5111": "And why on earth does she want to speak to me at all?",
  "5112": "What did you do it for?",
  "5113": "What can I do to serve you?",
  "5114": "What reason had you to strike the man who won my daughter?",
  "5115": "What good is arguments to me?",
  "5116": "And who escapes his lot?",
  "5117": "How is she looking?",
  "5118": "Why so?",
  "5119": "What did he wish for?",
  "5120": "Would she take it as a joke?",
  "5121": "And is she not effectually degraded?",
  "5122": "Final for couples?",
  "5123": "They must be sold, I suppose?",
  "5124": "But what shall I do?",
  "5125": "Who can tell what a dark, dreary, hopeless life I have dragged on for months past?",
  "5126": "What could be the trouble in that quarter?",
  "5127": "What does it matter, after all?",
  "5128": "What is the result of it?",
  "5129": "Did you hear that cry?",
  "5130": "Did you ever see such a large peach in all your life?",
  "5131": "How much are you to give him?",
  "5132": "How many?",
  "5133": "Everything as it used to be?",
  "5134": "And how may that be?",
  "5135": "Are you comfortable?",
  "5136": "Can there be a rational adjustment of the claims of each?",
  "5137": "Father, that money is mine, why should I speak to you about that?",
  "5138": "Surely, sweet, it shall never be our dwelling?",
  "5139": "If he is it's not much good my coming, is it?",
  "5140": "Would those stiff trees that had outlived the eagle, turn young and airy pages to him, to skip on his errands when he bade them?",
  "5141": "What is their story?",
  "5142": "At what hour shall we come?",
  "5143": "Have you any tips to give us before we clear out?",
  "5144": "Which is the principal aim of these three?",
  "5145": "Does not the word express more than the fact, and must not the actual, whatever a man may think, always, in the nature of things, fall short of the truth?",
  "5146": "That's to you, I suppose, child?",
  "5147": "How must I arrange it, then?",
  "5148": "Is it really?",
  "5149": "Do you want any assistance?",
  "5150": "Yes, and is there a rope handy?",
  "5151": "Do you think it would be good for you?",
  "5152": "Suppose I handed you over to the police?",
  "5153": "And is the art of war one of those arts in which she can or can not share?",
  "5154": "And when did you arrive here?",
  "5155": "But how did he procure his books?",
  "5156": "You know her only son died eight years ago?",
  "5157": "How far do you purpose to extend your walk?",
  "5158": "At once?",
  "5159": "You do not like it, then?",
  "5160": "Non es eques, quare?",
  "5161": "Boys, ma'am?",
  "5162": "Has he asked you to give me the message?",
  "5163": "Some holy book, no doubt?",
  "5164": "Is it possible that one can forget and forsake what he once loved?",
  "5165": "Shall I put myself into the harness to be worn out like an old horse?",
  "5166": "You come from the contractor, you say?",
  "5167": "Why do you do it?",
  "5168": "Am I never to hear the last of this?",
  "5169": "You say that these thirteen millions are found to be wanting in the accounts?",
  "5170": "Then why not admit that these may be replaced some day by other moral intuitions to be evolved in an unknown future?",
  "5171": "What of yourself?",
  "5172": "Surely there must be someone among all of you here who will turn this shameless creature out of the room?",
  "5173": "What on earth is the use of time to a fellow who has twice as much of it as he knows what to do with?",
  "5174": "Or had he found something he wished to keep to himself?",
  "5175": "And how do these wiseacres know that man wants a normal, a virtuous choice?",
  "5176": "Why not furnish an unequivocal explanation of its object?",
  "5177": "Do you see that mainmast there?",
  "5178": "Any letters for me?",
  "5179": "Why are you so upset?",
  "5180": "Have you never felt the romance of that love?",
  "5181": "An explanation, pray, of what?",
  "5182": "And how on earth do they get at it?",
  "5183": "Do they get you bairns?",
  "5184": "Cannot one find friends among the animals, and choose some tame kid or eloquent parrot or amiable monkey?",
  "5185": "You wish to exchange crosses?",
  "5186": "Well, and did you like it very much?",
  "5187": "Would you mind describing him to me?",
  "5188": "But do you understand the mission you are fulfilling?",
  "5189": "What do YOU mean, mother?",
  "5190": "How about accidents?",
  "5191": "Do you think this is the end?",
  "5192": "Doing well, I suppose?",
  "5193": "What doth it profit to argue about hidden and dark things, concerning which we shall not be even reproved in the judgment, because we knew them not?",
  "5194": "Where 'bouts do you live?",
  "5195": "And then, mother?",
  "5196": "Do you sometimes think that I took an unfair advantage of your weakness?",
  "5197": "In what way did you mean it, sir?",
  "5198": "What did the gentleman say to her, my sonny?",
  "5199": "Did he name no one in his passion?",
  "5200": "What kind of political ambition was to result from this destructive political education?",
  "5201": "He knows them, then?",
  "5202": "Could narrow passages spread from it through the foundations of the island?",
  "5203": "Suppose we were to meet any of them?",
  "5204": "Have you anything?",
  "5205": "And what is the cause of this?",
  "5206": "Or flatter sorry bunglers?",
  "5207": "By my orders?",
  "5208": "So you do not plead guilty?",
  "5209": "Now, are not you fancying, gentlemen, that I am expressing remorse for something now, that I am asking your forgiveness for something?",
  "5210": "Would a man grow weary of such a look turned on him, of such arms held out?",
  "5211": "Why does she give me notice when it's too late?",
  "5212": "Why then do we not follow his example, doing as he did in the countries through which we pass?",
  "5213": "Cancel?",
  "5214": "And have you forgiven her for all she has made you suffer?",
  "5215": "Which of us is there can tell how much vanity lurks in our warmest regard for others, and how selfish our love is?",
  "5216": "Has the owner many ships?",
  "5217": "To a distance?",
  "5218": "This house?",
  "5219": "You think it would?",
  "5220": "Are you having a good time?",
  "5221": "Have you heard this?",
  "5222": "Why, where have you been?",
  "5223": "But now who will relieve me of the dread?",
  "5224": "Have the which?",
  "5225": "Is it not obvious?",
  "5226": "Why did you come to tell me yourself, instead of sending my man?",
  "5227": "Holidays?",
  "5228": "I mean did you see the statue fall?",
  "5229": "And she refused you as she says?",
  "5230": "Durbeyfield?",
  "5231": "Can I see the letter?",
  "5232": "In what then, pray, shall I obey you?",
  "5233": "Why should you make a principle out of what you yourselves are, and must be?",
  "5234": "Why should we imagine that the precious metals are likely to do so?",
  "5235": "And what did he answer?",
  "5236": "What IS the matter?",
  "5237": "Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?",
  "5238": "What could he say to her now, after all he had said formerly, when he held her hands as he kissed her hair beside her cheeks?",
  "5239": "No female nurses?",
  "5240": "How did you happen to think of it?",
  "5241": "And what can I do but obey their commands?",
  "5242": "Would it, indeed, have been better if we had loved each other as a boy and a girl, and forgotten it?",
  "5243": "What social and political rights have women?",
  "5244": "And are they arrested?",
  "5245": "Puffs?",
  "5246": "Where do they come from, then?",
  "5247": "Marriage?",
  "5248": "Now, sir, why are you late again, as usual?",
  "5249": "Might anybody ask what their brother has been saying?",
  "5250": "Well, my children, what is going on now?",
  "5251": "What death?",
  "5252": "To what party did he belong?",
  "5253": "Does that suggest nothing to you?",
  "5254": "Where away?",
  "5255": "How did you penetrate hither?",
  "5256": "Caught cold in the grottos, at night, perhaps?",
  "5257": "You are sure?",
  "5258": "Well, and what did the last one say to ye?",
  "5259": "Did you come in the gig?",
  "5260": "And the DISENCHANTMENT of woman is in progress?",
  "5261": "Had your breakfast yet?",
  "5262": "Could he write something original?",
  "5263": "Breakfast?",
  "5264": "Now what does this imply?",
  "5265": "What possessed him to turn listener?",
  "5266": "Is this not a quite unusual politeness?",
  "5267": "Whatever have you done now?",
  "5268": "Are these things nothing?",
  "5269": "Did my sons get power and money?",
  "5270": "If they are such a happy class of people, how was it that you had such a time of punishing and hanging them within the last two years?",
  "5271": "And I have no doubt she loves you like a brother?",
  "5272": "And what have you been thinking about THEM, my busy bee?",
  "5273": "But how will it be?",
  "5274": "Could anything exceed the picture he gives one of scientific ardour?",
  "5275": "There is no exit that way?",
  "5276": "But was he worse?",
  "5277": "Yet how long before it was unsettled again?",
  "5278": "Philanthropy's sake?",
  "5279": "Or are they late because they have had a lovers' meeting?",
  "5280": "Is he very ill?",
  "5281": "Did he know them before?",
  "5282": "Cranly asked softly, happier than you are now, for instance?",
  "5283": "Why, what on earth does she do here?",
  "5284": "What does it matter to me whether the prince is to be what the late king was?",
  "5285": "How can I urge my daughters now to go and raise large families?",
  "5286": "And what did it matter?",
  "5287": "What are you meddling with, stupid?",
  "5288": "Why do you specify the fox?",
  "5289": "Who said that?",
  "5290": "But you have found out something for yourself?",
  "5291": "What is filled with more real existence, and actually has a more real existence, is more really filled than that which is filled with less real existence and is less real?",
  "5292": "Well, what if I could?",
  "5293": "Did you bet?",
  "5294": "Are you not weary of that stupid, meaningless, constantly repeated fraud?",
  "5295": "I say, you're not putting off a party tonight, are you?",
  "5296": "Well, then, what'll we make him the ink out of?",
  "5297": "But, bishop, the question is, who has the power to settle it?",
  "5298": "What does friendship mean if it not so?",
  "5299": "Well, what time for repayment do you wish me to take?",
  "5300": "Whuzzis?",
  "5301": "Why is the hawk so hated by birds?",
  "5302": "About measures, or rhythms, or verses?",
  "5303": "What sort of young woman?",
  "5304": "Do you know where I shall find him?",
  "5305": "I sprung out of bed, and asked, what wreck?",
  "5306": "Are you sure this time?",
  "5307": "Would he have drawn back?",
  "5308": "Why must he go around hunting for some one who is supporting me or has supported me at some time in his life, and who has said something at some time contrary to that platform?",
  "5309": "Had ever a queen such a throne before?",
  "5310": "And what do YOU want?",
  "5311": "Or was he a debtor or a debtor's son?",
  "5312": "Not quite so far, I hope?",
  "5313": "You are not angry with me?",
  "5314": "For what is maintenance?",
  "5315": "What will you?",
  "5316": "What does this mean?",
  "5317": "Go whither?",
  "5318": "Does he not set me at defiance?",
  "5319": "But, after the ball, why had he not returned?",
  "5320": "And where did you hear it?",
  "5321": "What data could he expect from an uncleaned watch?",
  "5322": "But what is all this about?",
  "5323": "And destroy their lives, when they've helped me to remake mine?",
  "5324": "But need we fear anything beyond a momentary anger?",
  "5325": "And which are these two sorts?",
  "5326": "To drink?",
  "5327": "What shall we do, then, to push this great war of freedom and justice to its righteous conclusion?",
  "5328": "Will you get the mail, dear?",
  "5329": "Yes, very noble?",
  "5330": "Do you know where I am leading you?",
  "5331": "Did we notify them of this sage view of ours when we borrowed their money?",
  "5332": "Why did you form a monster so hideous that even YOU turned from me in disgust?",
  "5333": "Atone for a fault by paying money?",
  "5334": "How can you build on such a quicksand?",
  "5335": "The proper determination of these relations rests on the question, to what faculty of cognition they subjectively belong, whether to sensibility or understanding?",
  "5336": "Is that cough of his better?",
  "5337": "Why does he not look at me?",
  "5338": "From what house does the young noble come?",
  "5339": "But now how stands the wind?",
  "5340": "You promise me that frankness?",
  "5341": "And are you building?",
  "5342": "Would his uncle give him a place in the bank?",
  "5343": "Hearken to me, will you?",
  "5344": "What do you think, would they give us anything for it?",
  "5345": "Do you not know?",
  "5346": "How far does one of these little revolvers carry?",
  "5347": "Shall I seal the door?",
  "5348": "What did you take her?",
  "5349": "Yea, and what work, king's daughter?",
  "5350": "You're going to keep open the proposition, so to speak?",
  "5351": "How long will the air in the reservoirs last for us to breathe on board?",
  "5352": "What have you to offer to me, my friend?",
  "5353": "No doubt you felt this yourself?",
  "5354": "Would he take her back to the beach or would he keep her here?",
  "5355": "Coom, wakken oop, will 'ee?",
  "5356": "And that principle which repels the musical, or the just?",
  "5357": "Why had he withheld life from her?",
  "5358": "Is life grievous to you?",
  "5359": "And are we to be carried on far and away into remote distance, and never, never to return?",
  "5360": "Why do you speak so?",
  "5361": "As for what you do me the honor to say, I presume you mean I was afraid?",
  "5362": "So, why not accept these sports as legitimate expressions of a normal and wholesome human nature?",
  "5363": "Whose camp are you in, those who bless or those who curse?",
  "5364": "Is it my mother?",
  "5365": "What is your opinion of it?",
  "5366": "How in the world did you deduce that?",
  "5367": "Now guess what the young one did?",
  "5368": "What money is there to be made here in any other way?",
  "5369": "But suppose she does come there?",
  "5370": "And was this not to be obtained?",
  "5371": "Your reason, your reason for this?",
  "5372": "And silent all?",
  "5373": "What keeps them dancing till five o'clock in the morning through a whole mortal season?",
  "5374": "Why is it not seen that these ideas are mutually repellent, and that, if, by some impossibility, the proletaire could reach a certain degree of intelligence, he would make use of it in the first place to revolutionize society and change all civil and industrial relations?",
  "5375": "What can it be, then?",
  "5376": "Are you aware what you are saying, my lord?",
  "5377": "So much per man?",
  "5378": "What made you go away with him?",
  "5379": "Will all things be set right in the nation?",
  "5380": "Have you informed him of it?",
  "5381": "What is this vessel?",
  "5382": "Devotion which is weary, heroism which has grown old, ambitions which are sated, fortunes which are made, seek, demand, implore, solicit, what?",
  "5383": "Would you venture to so consider them had they been committed by any nation on earth against the humblest of our people?",
  "5384": "He?",
  "5385": "But who had made her tell it?",
  "5386": "To get her out of my bride's way, who might otherwise walk over her rather too emphatically?",
  "5387": "What is the best way of living for us monks?",
  "5388": "Was that the reason why you quitted the service, monsieur le chevalier?",
  "5389": "Where were you meaning to spend the evening?",
  "5390": "Come at last where your duty calls you, eh?",
  "5391": "Who will push a drum hither for me?",
  "5392": "Who has a right to strike her dead?",
  "5393": "Could it be well that she should sacrifice the happiness of two persons to a theoretic love of pure blood?",
  "5394": "But how is it that you know so much of these matters?",
  "5395": "And what is the faculty in man to which imitation is addressed?",
  "5396": "But where do you come from not to know what every coachman in the town knows?",
  "5397": "What is that pain like?",
  "5398": "Drop me in the park, will you?",
  "5399": "When do you wish the carriage to be here?",
  "5400": "Any one dead?",
  "5401": "Have you lost it?",
  "5402": "But if you have a genius for painting, would it not be right to take that as a guide?",
  "5403": "Is that the question?",
  "5404": "A philosopher, perhaps?",
  "5405": "Is it likely?",
  "5406": "May I count upon your assistance?",
  "5407": "Are the eggs nice?",
  "5408": "Of tea with me over the fire?",
  "5409": "And now, my friend, as you cannot come to me, may I come to you?",
  "5410": "Why not today?",
  "5411": "What?",
  "5412": "Will you render me a little help?",
  "5413": "Are you scoffing at me?",
  "5414": "How do you suppose I managed when you were away?",
  "5415": "Is it so, or is it not so?",
  "5416": "If he could mollify the lioness with such a sop, how happy would he think his first efforts had been?",
  "5417": "And are you nervous?",
  "5418": "Do you say no?",
  "5419": "And why may we not continue that ratio far beyond that period?",
  "5420": "In the churchyard?",
  "5421": "And how so, if you please?",
  "5422": "Abdicated?",
  "5423": "Why tell all that?",
  "5424": "And with regard to us, how were you placed?",
  "5425": "Then where is he gone?",
  "5426": "Think of you?",
  "5427": "Or did I only imagine that you did?",
  "5428": "Yet what do we have but words?",

  "6663": "What flood?",
  "6664": "Is it a man you seen?",
  "6665": "Do you believe that?",
  "6666": "But how does that come about?",
  "6667": "Can we do aught to assist the wretched man?",
  "6668": "Did he say when the battles are to begin?",
  "6669": "How can I find her?",
  "6670": "How do you know?",
  "6671": "What greater luck could he have than to be brought safely home to his father?",
  "6672": "Or is your brain really unhinged?",
  "6673": "And what was then his conduct?",
  "6674": "So you've come, you rascal?",
  "6675": "Is it not truly to ransom prisoners?",
  "6676": "But does that part of the body understand or what?",

  "6678": "Do you despair now?",
  "6679": "What, I say, is to become of those wretches?",
  "6680": "Do you know that I am growing old?",
  "6681": "How then is it that those people pretend to reject reason?",
  "6682": "Did I say, a few days since, that I had nothing to do with him but to receive my salary at his hands?",
  "6683": "And to what end can it serve either for the service of mankind, or for my own private interest?",
  "6684": "In the few hours that I can possibly allow to elapse before I publish the truth, how is he to be found by us, and only by us?",
  "6685": "Will you have a glass of brandy?",
  "6686": "And fetch him where?",

  "6695": "Oh, is he going to take you for a nice drive?",
  "6696": "Surely not let them go unpunished?",
  "6697": "Is that true?",
  "6698": "You know, monseigneur, we set out in search of our comrades?",
  "6699": "Yes, miss?",
  "6700": "If our asteroid has carried with it a portion of the old earth's atmosphere, why should it not likewise retain something of its central fire?",
  "6701": "And this assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice or gesture, is the imitation of the person whose character he assumes?",
  "6702": "Somebody else?",
  "6703": "In the king's service?",
  "6704": "Why, what is important?",
  "6705": "Where are you living?",
  "6706": "But what is straightforward?",

  "6721": "But who perpetrated that joke, let me ask?",
  "6722": "Is there any difficulty in the way?",
  "6723": "Where will their insolence stop?",
  "6724": "Is this aggression?",
  "6725": "Which of the two will hurl the other over?",
  "6726": "Did she ever talk of revisiting the place?",
  "6727": "You suspect some one?",
  "6728": "What has been decided?",
  "6729": "You shall stay here, do you hear?",
  "6730": "What's become of the boy?",
  "6731": "Where could he?",
  "6732": "Was it even a union in love and goodness?",

  "6743": "To sit?",
  "6744": "What was she being tried for?",
  "6745": "What are those two words, and what is their meaning?",
  "6746": "Do you admire that sort of woman, prince?",
  "6747": "Would this afternoon be inconvenient?",
  "6748": "When are we going to have the marriage?",
  "6749": "Is I ME, or who IS I?",
  "6750": "Does not the boar break cover just when you're lighting a weed?",
  "6751": "And have you had any shooting yet this year?",
  "6752": "Wait a minute, would you mind?",
  "6753": "What evil memory is this?",
  "6754": "For what is bombast but a force of expression too great for the magnitude of the ideas embodied?",
  "6755": "At what hour?",
  "6756": "About how much?",
  "6757": "May we inquire what is this recipe?",
  "6758": "Now, darling, what shall we do?",
  "6759": "You have quite turned his head, and why?",
  "6760": "Has it been proved?",
  "6761": "And do you often go out?",
  "6762": "What will break the enchantment of animation?",
  "6763": "What's that you are saying to me?",
  "6764": "What, are you no longer in possession of your senses?",
  "6765": "With what sang froid artful trains of corruption bring lucrative commissions into particular hands, disregarding the relative situation of different countries, and can much common honesty be expected in the discharge of trusts obtained by fraud?",
  "6766": "Is it a note?",
  "6767": "Now, what sum have you about you?",
  "6768": "Is it your bashfulness, said he, or your obstinacy, that makes you not choose I should read it before you?",
  "6769": "But how, then, could he have known my reply if it had been in the negative?",
  "6770": "Might I ask in which direction you are going?",

  "6772": "Do the days when you sat at your mother's knee, seem days of very long ago?",
  "6773": "And before hunting them mercilessly, you would not wait until they had committed some fresh act of hostility against us?",
  "6774": "How could things have taken such a violent turn, and so quickly?",
  "6775": "Where does she live?",
  "6776": "What's the strength of the enemy behind that ridge?",
  "6777": "Why stand you distant, nor attempt a deed?",
  "6778": "Are our lackeys sufficiently devoted to us to risk their lives for us?",
  "6779": "Has your majesty nothing else to say to me?",
  "6780": "How do you feed him?",
  "6781": "Because I want to know in which of the three classes you would place justice?",
  "6782": "Had he not gained a great victory, and was it not fit that he should step into his cab with triumph?",
  "6783": "You have news to impart?",
  "6784": "And wheres the duke?",
  "6785": "But what is the use of asking a jellyfish to sit up straight?",

  "6797": "How should we do?",
  "6798": "How do you expect to manage the balloon?",
  "6799": "Who is coming here so early in the morning?",
  "6800": "Why, surely he has not changed his mind about marrying?",
  "6801": "I should like to know upon what occasion?",
  "6802": "Am I falling?",
  "6803": "But what is it, CHERIE?",

  "6815": "And this is the little girl you have adopted, I suppose?",
  "6816": "Hear ye?",
  "6817": "What's the next?",
  "6818": "Were you waiting for me?",
  "6819": "This very instant?",

  "6821": "Go and where shall I find you?",
  "6822": "Will he return this evening?",
  "6823": "Not when you are with me?",
  "6824": "Is he at home?",
  "6825": "Shall I e'er forget it, mun?",
  "6826": "And that mysterious staircase, the passage through which, not to disturb their sleep, the doctor and nurse pass, or even the father carrying the sleeping child?",
  "6827": "Do you hate it?",
  "6828": "How a wedding present?",
  "6829": "What else?",
  "6830": "And he was alone in achieving an enterprise like that?",
  "6831": "Why has she refused him?",
  "6832": "Why is there an allusion to that cursed 'poor knight' in the anonymous letter?",

  "6837": "You are not convinced yet?",
  "6838": "Have you provided yourself with money?",
  "6839": "I'm rather on the spot this evening, eh?",
  "6840": "Did she see you?",
  "6841": "Do people die of it?",
  "6842": "I suppose there is nothing to prevent it?",
  "6843": "Did not my neck glitter with diamonds?",
  "6844": "How comes it?",
  "6845": "How otherwise should I have been bad enough?",
  "6846": "You do not reply?",
  "6847": "Then would you call injustice malignity?",
  "6848": "Which will conquer?",
  "6849": "Well, what did the king say?",
  "6850": "Are you sure you're quite so much as six foot three?",
  "6851": "And why, may I ask?",
  "6852": "But we have grain belonging to my brother?",
  "6853": "Is that so, sir?",
  "6854": "What course would then have been left to him?",
  "6855": "Do you hear that baggage?",
  "6856": "Must believe?",
  "6857": "How should I know, my dear?",
  "6858": "Why should its existence be prolonged one hour?",
  "6859": "If the prince knew propriety, who does not know it?",
  "6860": "Now, we ask, what was there in this cave to cause a departure from the ordinary course of nature?",
  "6861": "What's the matter aloft there?",
  "6862": "Should war break out in any of those countries who can foretell the extent to which it may be carried or the desolation which it may spread?",
  "6863": "Quite certain?",
  "6864": "Well?",
  "6865": "And what sort of revenge would you take?",
  "6866": "Is it a time of war?",
  "6867": "I suppose that there has been no answer from my cabman advertisement?",
  "6868": "At this hour who would pass now?",

  "6871": "Why should he go to a play if he enjoys it so little?",
  "6872": "Was it an angel's voice?",
  "6873": "Why, then, had he come hither?",
  "6874": "What was his version?",
  "6875": "Is it not perfectly clear, that this argument applies with exactly as much force to every combination of human beings for a common purpose, as to governments?",
  "6876": "Yet what good end can all this superficial counsel produce?",
  "6877": "What's the report of this boy?",
  "6878": "Take a glass of wine?",
  "6879": "And what has become of that scoundrel?",
  "6880": "But, what will you do?",
  "6881": "Are you coming down and fight fair?",
  "6882": "But what is the meaning of all this?",
  "6883": "Where be the dogs?",
  "6884": "Well, what have I learned since?",
  "6885": "Would it bore you if I came in for a quarter of an hour?",
  "6886": "But if I disagree with his lordship's views?",
  "6887": "What can they mean?",
  "6888": "He has had punch already, has he not, sir?",
  "6889": "Shall you come down in the world for want of this letter about your son?",
  "6890": "Why, instead of fascinating us with contradictory opinions, did he not reverse experience by causing us to reach the antinomies by the path of analysis of synthetic ideas, instead of leaving us to painfully clamber up the steeps of antinomy to synthesis?",
  "6891": "So, then, you must leave us?",
  "6892": "But at any rate I have shown, have I not, that there is a certain element of improbability about the lady's story?",
  "6893": "And do you use this often?",
  "6894": "Has he got any?",
  "6895": "Are they friendly to us, do you think?",
  "6896": "Me alone?",
  "6897": "And you allow then, sir, that spheres exist, and that these marked and invisible beings mingle amongst us?",
  "6898": "Who knows if they will not manage to restore to me my pension?",
  "6899": "Who would not, when there was the pretext of casting disgrace upon him, confound his whole life and the truths he had espoused, in one heap of obloquy?",
  "6900": "Poodle?",
  "6901": "Is she dead?",
  "6902": "But were you not on horseback?",
  "6903": "Is the countess up yet?",
  "6904": "Then this young man escaped with you?",
  "6905": "Where are my armies, my troops, my treasures?",
  "6906": "Canler?",
  "6907": "Do you belong to the number of the happy or of the miserable?",
  "6908": "Will you promise to be quiet, and not kick up a fuss if I get you something to eat?",
  "6909": "And they not rich?",
  "6910": "In the rouge way?",
  "6911": "She did not resist, for what could she do?",
  "6912": "I shall hear from you?",
  "6913": "What what is, my dear?",
  "6914": "What did you do yesterday afternoon?",
  "6915": "Exploring or what?",
  "6916": "Why was he carried in a cart?",
  "6917": "Why surprised?",
  "6918": "What are you kicking up this row for?",
  "6919": "Yet are you not sorry for fellows of that stamp?",
  "6920": "What if he turns against the others?",
  "6921": "For is not my lord the son of a king?",
  "6922": "Why is it so long?",
  "6923": "Will he even pay me for his lodging?",
  "6924": "A mistake?",
  "6925": "Shall any man hate me?",
  "6926": "Two figures?",
  "6927": "What will dart out presently?",
  "6928": "Does he regret me a little?",
  "6929": "How do you look at the question?",
  "6930": "You remember?",
  "6931": "Then why are there different faiths?",
  "6932": "What be they?",
  "6933": "Have you any further commands for me?",
  "6934": "Is this your pupil?",
  "6935": "And what, pray, WAS the price?",
  "6936": "How is it with you?",
  "6937": "What o'clock is it?",
  "6938": "How could you go to live in a street like that, which is sickly, which is disagreeable, which is ugly, which has a barrier at one end, where one is cold, and into which one cannot enter?",
  "6939": "Surely the writer does not mean that a pleasant or delectable island would not be fit for breeding horses?",
  "6940": "You are a good temper?",
  "6941": "Had the crew seen me disappear?",
  "6942": "Now, do you understand me?",
  "6943": "How many times will I have to speak of this matter?",
  "6944": "On your arm?",
  "6945": "I understand, however, from the inquest that there were some objects which you failed to overlook?",
  "6946": "Where are the graces of my soul?",
  "6947": "Do you know, sir, said she, that her ladyship intends to be down here with you in a few days?",
  "6948": "What is the meaning of this hunt, skipper?",
  "6949": "Why, had you no unicorn's horn, nor bezoar's stone about you, ha?",
  "6950": "Did you really think me capable of that?",
  "6951": "How do you like her, my dear?",
  "6952": "Shall I sure?",
  "6953": "Bobby?",
  "6954": "Is she sorry for her shameful conduct?",
  "6955": "Whose portraits are those?",
  "6956": "What was the subject of these singular conversations?",
  "6957": "Is it a check to the action of the individual?",
  "6958": "She is melancholy, then?",
  "6959": "Is is a bargain?",
  "6960": "Would not your excellency like a little refreshment?",
  "6961": "So, then, they have paid my ransom?",
  "6962": "Well, mademoiselle, what are you thinking about, standing there like a statue?",
  "6963": "Will you undertake the task?",
  "6964": "Tell me, will you do this for me, and cease to weep?",
  "6965": "Come, how much?",
  "6966": "Do you know, sir, that you are asking me very strange questions, and that I am very foolish to answer them?",
  "6967": "There is a principle of law and reason in him which bids him resist, as well as a feeling of his misfortune which is forcing him to indulge his sorrow?",
  "6968": "Shall I climb the magnolia?",
  "6969": "What becomes of them?",
  "6970": "Eh, madame, who knows?",
  "6971": "The ghost?",
  "6972": "Gwendolen, will you marry me?",
  "6973": "Will you not rest here?",
  "6974": "What were you thinking of?",
  "6975": "You let my mother alone, will you?",
  "6976": "But what are you going to do?",
  "6977": "What proof may there be that you can do your part in the compact?",
  "6978": "Does he play well?",
  "6979": "Then what?",
  "6980": "Do you mean to say you have had my cigarette case all this time?",
  "6981": "What shall we do then?",
  "6982": "Jean, do you think that I am quite mad?",
  "6983": "Why is not her joy complete?",
  "6984": "Do you know his abode?",
  "6985": "And who was this uncle?",
  "6986": "And will not such things sharpen your souls to revenge?",
  "6987": "Oh, what do you want?",
  "6988": "Who asked after a day or two?",
  "6989": "Is this our previous understanding?",
  "6990": "Certainly, why not?",
  "6991": "What orders, your excellency?",
  "6992": "Suppose the worst?",
  "6993": "Then you will not resign, under any circumstances?",
  "6994": "What was the fist?",
  "6995": "My pretty lady, are you come to stay with us?",
  "6996": "What is their object?",
  "6997": "Do I know myself?",
  "6998": "Is he alone?",
  "6999": "And is there not a species of deceit in this to which the honesty of the present age should lend no countenance?",
  "7000": "You who never interest yourself in politics?",
  "7001": "Was it because I wished to give you pain?",
  "7002": "Have WE horns on our heads?",
  "7003": "What on earth do you mean?",
  "7004": "And what about it after all?",
  "7005": "Do you fancy that you can deceive him?",
  "7006": "But, pardon me, have you heard anything of that son?",
  "7007": "Is there any principle in these things?",
  "7008": "A convert to what?",
  "7009": "Who ever did?",
  "7010": "That is an important point, do you understand?",
  "7011": "And what do you mean by your look?",
  "7012": "Guleesh, you clown, you thief, that no good may happen you, why did you play that trick on us?",
  "7013": "Then may I telegraph to the advocate?",
  "7014": "Break off all intercourse with him?",
  "7015": "How do we discover that, in an isosceles triangle, the sides which subtend the equal angles are equal?",
  "7016": "Am I so unlike my countrymen?",
  "7017": "Did you ever know men rise by their own merit under kings?",
  "7018": "And the woman?",
  "7019": "And how do you like being your own mistress?",
  "7020": "But, indeed, what can you expect, monseigneur?",
  "7021": "But can you stay till tomowwow?",
  "7022": "Where shall I meet you?",
  "7023": "You have to confess something?",
  "7024": "And the name of the third?",
  "7025": "Did she say anything more?",
  "7026": "If I am guilty, why am I more fit for a second consulship than I was for my first one?",
  "7027": "Was it not rather because his life was full of bliss that he found strength to live?",
  "7028": "Is it possible that he can have lived at the bottom of the sea?",
  "7029": "If not, why should you come to consult me?",
  "7030": "Lassitude would have come to us, and who knows if I should not even have had the atrocious pain of witnessing your remorse, of sharing it myself, since I should have been its cause?",
  "7031": "Why, where did you leave her?",
  "7032": "How did he hurt himself?",
  "7033": "What shall he be called by us?",
  "7034": "Shall I travel?",
  "7035": "BUT WHAT NEXT?",
  "7036": "You with an old father, and you with pleasant and playful ways?",
  "7037": "Why have your companions deserted you?",
  "7038": "You have promised him that I shall live?",
  "7039": "When shall we two walk together?",
  "7040": "How am I to believe you at present?",
  "7041": "What dress would you like?",
  "7042": "Will you ask me to call it, being for me?",
  "7043": "To whom else could she in such plight look for love?",
  "7044": "What does every one who wants to step into the street do?",
  "7045": "Did you make up anything else?",
  "7046": "Fitted to sustain the weight of armor, or to practise the exercises of the camp?",
  "7047": "O'Dowd?",
  "7048": "Did she forget me, in the course of time?",
  "7049": "Do you want to be a gentleman, to spite her or to gain her over?",
  "7050": "With what kind of parental reflections can the father or mother contemplate their younger offspring?",
  "7051": "Why do you talk of wages?",
  "7052": "Cunningham's?",
  "7053": "Why so early?",
  "7054": "Then why did she run away the moment I came in?",
  "7055": "Why do you run so fast?",
  "7056": "Does not that strike you?",
  "7057": "And when will the dance begin?",
  "7058": "Then you are quite at ease, my lord?",
  "7059": "What did I see there?",
  "7060": "Nothing will stop you?",
  "7061": "Why should the generations overlap one another at all?",

  "7064": "Who could have done less for her?",
  "7065": "Who can it be, then?",
  "7066": "And why should you take trouble?",
  "7067": "Or does he feel that he is sketching an inescapable human condition which makes all of us bear the burden of loneliness?",
  "7068": "You have not allowed him to penetrate your secret, then?",
  "7069": "You keep it on?",
  "7070": "Or are they digging side by side on different lines?",

  "7457": "How does she live?",
  "7458": "Who stole my bread?",
  "7459": "Were we to die as he had done?",
  "7460": "Is it then surprising, that when the sole ambition of woman centres in beauty, and interest gives vanity additional force, perpetual rivalships should ensue?",
  "7461": "Then what on earth are they up to?",

  "7468": "What am I to say to him?",
  "7469": "What more can he do?",
  "7470": "But who can be angry at those assiduities which are meant to please him?",
  "7471": "Does that kind go smoothly?",
  "7472": "Does it hurt?",
  "7473": "Where are you, old fellow?",
  "7474": "And have quite forgiven me?",

  "9420": "Has your excellency found our defense so feeble as to believe the measure necessary?",
  "9421": "For why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do?",
  "9422": "You did not take to pieces all the chairs?",
  "9423": "Is it you, my child?",

  "9566": "What has it found?",
  "9567": "And what is there that can better deserve to be preserved?",
  "9568": "And you have a letter?",
  "9569": "And what do they teach you?",
  "9570": "And the fleet?",
  "9571": "Then how prove that we will as we do, because of the equivalence of the pleasure to the pain?",
  "9572": "You had better have a slice of ham or an egg, or something with your tea?",
  "9573": "Have you not heard?",
  "9574": "Would it be all right to telephone down to the office, or do you think it would be better to ring?",
  "9575": "But the bicycle?",
  "9576": "Could it be done?",
  "9577": "Had the man succeeded in making his escape?",
  "9578": "Can one drink to the sun's health, do you think, prince?",
  "9579": "Will you not cease to lend an ear to those orators of mysticism who tell you to pray and to wait, preaching salvation now through religion, now through power, and whose vehement and sonorous words captivate you?",
  "9580": "Monk?",
  "9581": "Can you be more kind in your daily life?",

  "9590": "Is there anything you would like?",
  "9591": "News?",
  "9592": "And how many have you in charge?",
  "9593": "I say, what's the matter with you?",
  "9594": "And, to avoid censure, what sacrifices are not made by weak minds?",
  "9595": "Well, what am I to do?",
  "9596": "Where is the money?",
  "9597": "Have you brought your wife?",

  "9604": "What made you go at all?",
  "9605": "She lets you off?",
  "9606": "And to what can it so naturally change as to affections or emotions, which are suitable to the temper, and agree with that set of passions, which then prevail?",
  "9607": "Well, did you like their horses?",
  "9608": "Do you know to whom you speak?",

  "9617": "Are you serious, mother?",
  "9618": "What will you say to him now?",
  "9619": "What did she call me?",
  "9620": "What's the use of recalling what's past?",
  "9621": "How does he stand?",
  "9622": "Have you any objection to meet any persons who may be with madame, or do you desire to preserve a strict incognito?",
  "9623": "Or is it given to him?",
  "9624": "What other reason could he have?",
  "9625": "What about him?",
  "9626": "Oh, you're there, are you?",
  "9627": "Have you been ill?",
  "9628": "And surely you have known a city ere now that has marshalled her battalions against a rival state, but with defeat she changes suddenly and is willing to obey and not resist?",
  "9629": "For heaven's sake, where is that?",
  "9630": "How did you leave the count?",
  "9631": "And what did she answer, madame?",
  "9632": "Should we not do better in the grottos?",
  "9633": "What is the matter now, my bold equestrian?",
  "9634": "What will my husband say?",
  "9635": "How can there be?",
  "9636": "Up the river?",
  "9637": "From whom may the letter be you bear to his eminence?",
  "9638": "More than ten pounds?",
  "9639": "To what extent, at this time, was she really a victim?",
  "9640": "What is he here for?",
  "9641": "Lachenel?",
  "9642": "Have you not seen him?",
  "9643": "And so you pick me up in your round, eh?",
  "9644": "What should I be afraid of?",
  "9645": "Where, where, he asked himself, was it all to end?",
  "9646": "Do you not see that you are sliding down a declivity, and that you are obliged to grasp at something similar to the existing law?",
  "9647": "Did she go last night?",
  "9648": "What CAN be done about her?",
  "9649": "Is there anything else you want, good man?",
  "9650": "What view do you take of it?",
  "9651": "And what is knowledge, and among whom is it found?",
  "9652": "Half a crown?",
  "9653": "Did this arise from scorn or from respect?",
  "9654": "Would you mind giving me a little something?",
  "9655": "Who is our friend, my dear friend?",
  "9656": "What does he do that for?",
  "9657": "For what time shall I order dinner?",
  "9658": "Yes, but beer?",
  "9659": "You remember, miss, that we passed some conversation on a certain man this morning?",
  "9660": "What was that?",
  "9661": "Why have you stayed away so long?",
  "9662": "Under her direct appeal for the truth?",
  "9663": "Did you hit your man?",
  "9664": "Is it not time to awake from the deceitful dream of a golden age, and to adopt as a practical maxim for the direction of our political conduct that we, as well as the other inhabitants of the globe, are yet remote from the happy empire of perfect wisdom and perfect virtue?",
  "9665": "Says his father is buried there, eh?",
  "9666": "She has had what she wanted from the house?",
  "9667": "It is a conspiracy, then?",
  "9668": "You would not have recognized me?",
  "9669": "What conclusion do you draw from it?",
  "9670": "Is there a little boy here?",
  "9671": "How could we know when you would return?",
  "9672": "But what further do they couple with these demands which they make for congressional legislation?",
  "9673": "Has he been drinking?",
  "9674": "Did you see what he went after?",
  "9675": "Shillings perhaps?",
  "9676": "How did it begin?",
  "9677": "Did you quarrel with him?",
  "9678": "And you loved her?",
  "9679": "Where are you going so fast?",
  "9680": "What do you think better?",
  "9681": "What availed him then his strength and his prowess?",
  "9682": "But surely he has been destroyed?",
  "9683": "Does the gentleman always have books like that under his arm?",
  "9684": "Was he seen to come out?",
  "9685": "Is your excellency really in earnest?",
  "9686": "And what did she say to that?",
  "9687": "To whom can I speak it now?",
  "9688": "Who owes it you?",
  "9689": "What will the poor authors do in the presence of this omnipotent union of booksellers?",
  "9690": "But you said when we were getting up this morning that you had something you wished to tell me before I left?",
  "9691": "Did you fancy yourself dying?",
  "9692": "Aramis become your surety?",
  "9693": "Does he say so?",
  "9694": "What do you think will happen?",
  "9695": "What impression has my evidence made upon you?",
  "9696": "At what time will it be ready?",
  "9697": "And how do you come to be in our province?",
  "9698": "Where is that friend or enemy now?",
  "9699": "Do you support him for that purpose?",
  "9700": "Will you wait till you love no longer?",
  "9701": "How could I bring him?",

  "9707": "Are coals to be relied upon?",
  "9708": "What are your rates?",
  "9709": "But when?",
  "9710": "What have we seen in our own personal walks through life to make us believe that women are devils?",
  "9711": "Is that mere guesswork?",
  "9712": "Who then is YOUR neighbour?",
  "9713": "But my horse, madame?",
  "9714": "Did you happen to meet any soldiers, my dear, as you came through the wood?",
  "9715": "Has he been wounded, then?",
  "9716": "D'you mean to say that you could take me back after all that's happened?",
  "9717": "Whatever is this?",
  "9718": "And begging your pardon, mister, what name will we call you, for we'd like to know?",
  "9719": "Do not they know where the shoe pinches?",
  "9720": "But will he listen to me?",
  "9721": "What did you RECKON he wanted with it?",
  "9722": "But your own vessel, monsieur?",
  "9723": "Do you think he is old?",
  "9724": "And it's going on?",
  "9725": "Now spose you make me an offer?",
  "9726": "How can the continued overflowings of a susceptible heart suffer it to be incessantly employed in so many little cares relative to the person?",
  "9727": "Vholes?",
  "9728": "There has not been any change made about your own arrangements?",
  "9729": "Do you question it, when you will make me proud and happy above all others of your court?",
  "9730": "Was that lure of men even now in the house, completing her evil work?",
  "9731": "Can he be right?",
  "9732": "What was he like?",
  "9733": "What was the subject, madam?",
  "9734": "But are our missionaries capable?",
  "9735": "Where does he eat?",
  "9736": "What right have you to ask?",
  "9737": "Who was this new, radiant being who had won to existence out of the mist and darkness of our fears?",
  "9738": "I wonder where that ship comes from?",
  "9739": "What gentleman is this?",
  "9740": "Just lend me your scarf, will you?",
  "9741": "But what can they intend to do with the poor creature, and how shall I ever meet her again?",
  "9742": "Says the coroner, is that boy here?",
  "9743": "No kidding?",
  "9744": "Will yo tak' a message to him?",
  "9745": "If there be no life, the same as the animal's life in the vegetables, how could animals sustain their lives feeding on vegetables?",
  "9746": "Do you think there will be?",
  "9747": "But you've had enough now?",
  "9748": "Things fo' me?",
  "9749": "And you would wish me to advance some money?",
  "9750": "Now what is there in her?",
  "9751": "Does it follow that the preferences of love and friendship are unjust?",
  "9752": "But then, where could it be?",
  "9753": "Oh, you mean a change?",
  "9754": "Did you see a man in the pit?",
  "9755": "Do you think they'll object?",
  "9756": "Then there is nothing impossible or out of the order of nature in our finding a guardian who has a similar combination of qualities?",
  "9757": "Will you come back to me?",
  "9758": "And I think a glass of wine will not be disagreeable to you?",
  "9759": "What's that, a dog?",
  "9760": "How did you know I was in service?",
  "9761": "So you can stay here and trifle around with some one else?",
  "9762": "What could I do with myself?",
  "9763": "Then the just is like the wise and good, and the unjust like the evil and ignorant?",
  "9764": "Who can he be?",
  "9765": "And the silver?",
  "9766": "How can we possibly be anything else?",
  "9767": "You have a theory?",
  "9768": "Will not the post be better?",
  "9769": "And do you think now that she could undertake a voyage of some extent?",
  "9770": "Do you suppose I should contend against the most valiant sword in the kingdom?",
  "9771": "A lesson?",
  "9772": "Justified yourself, have you?",
  "9773": "And when they have been enriched, what more shall be done?",
  "9774": "Assault, riot, theft, what do you call these?",
  "9775": "What is a LEGISLATIVE power, but a power of making LAWS?",

  "9782": "But would he?",
  "9783": "What makes you think it 'ud be against his will?",
  "9784": "For heaven's sake what have you done?",
  "9785": "Who, after such brilliant examples of our annihilating justice, who dare accuse us of forbearance?",
  "9786": "How explain, how find out her wishes?",
  "9787": "What then remained for me to do?",
  "9788": "You refer to the possible hindrances from want of health?",
  "9789": "What other hardier pioneer would come, hatchet in hand, to cut down the dark copses?",
  "9790": "Ever been kicked?",
  "9791": "Well, how do YOU explain it?",
  "9792": "And to what penalty do you think the king will be condemned?",
  "9793": "Why was my heart so faint?",
  "9794": "How has that contest gone?",
  "9795": "Then you did not see either of them?",
  "9796": "Then why are you leaving?",
  "9797": "On what occasion would it be most probable that such a presentation would be made?",
  "9798": "Il est mort?",
  "9799": "Then why does he follow you so with his eyes, and get you so frequently alone with him, and keep you so continually at his side?",
  "9800": "Perhaps you have some special information?",
  "9801": "Then how in the name of all that is wonderful did you get these facts?",
  "9802": "And is not this enough to prove that the establishment of equal toleration was not his plan?",
  "9803": "What is the sun?",
  "9804": "Had he a hat?",
  "9805": "After all, the question is still where?",
  "9806": "Did he not tell you?",
  "9807": "Do you live in this room always?",
  "9808": "But what happened to you?",
  "9809": "Where do the sailor live?",
  "9810": "Are we happy because we are good, or are we good because we are happy?",
  "9811": "How, pray?",
  "9812": "Your letters?",
  "9813": "Or in love with the professor's wife?",
  "9814": "How can you hope to reform her after the life she has led?",
  "9815": "For what reason?",
  "9816": "What can be the matter?",

  "9828": "Why will you not let yourself be guided by those who are older and wiser than you?",
  "9829": "Have you chosen a post in which you might be of service to your neighbor?",
  "9830": "Is this house all yours, or joint property?",
  "9831": "Shall I be damned?",
  "9832": "What can have happened to him?",
  "9833": "In this prison that I am going to so unjustly, shall I have some free communication with the world outside?",
  "9834": "What could he reply when asked wherefore, and with what motive, he had been found alone in the night, armed with a sword, in the thickest of the wood?",
  "9835": "Is it not just, however, that they should have their reward, on account of these?",
  "9836": "What sort of cloth is it?",
  "9837": "How does the mortal world go?",
  "9838": "What are you going to say?",

  "9841": "But what extraordinary tumult do I hear?",
  "9842": "But what did you say?",
  "9843": "Doctor, am I not to go with you?",
  "9844": "These volcanoes, however, were at one time in a state of activity?",
  "9845": "Disturbed her?",
  "9846": "Why do you attribute to me a wish for anything that would annoy you?",
  "9847": "She's got no money, you mean?",
  "9848": "Could something have happened out there to keep her away?",
  "9849": "Who'll look after you on this ship?",
  "9850": "The cargo on board?",
  "9851": "Why will they leave us some regret?",
  "9852": "Ah, your favourites are among these?",
  "9853": "Why, did not I tell you she had been stolen from me?",
  "9854": "When, oh when, would his new clothes be ready?",
  "9855": "Say when shall it be?",
  "9856": "Would it be to promote emancipation?",
  "9857": "Or is it the death of some dear friend that has disturbed his mind?",
  "9858": "Why is it that we see no therns?",
  "9859": "Call you that hope, your highness?",
  "9860": "What fault do you find with her?",
  "9861": "Why was his brow clammy with drops of moisture, his knees shaking beneath him, and his soul oppressed with a cold gloom?",
  "9862": "Why is she wandering alone through these mountains?",
  "9863": "If we reject it now, is there any human probability that we shall ever see again so propitious a set of circumstances to bring about the same results?",
  "9864": "Was it indeed a house of death to which I had come, too late?",
  "9865": "Where is that?",
  "9866": "And those who govern ought not to be lovers of the task?",
  "9867": "Why should a man like you go about telling lies in this way?",
  "9868": "And if he could not resist ME, do you think his daughter could resist HIM?",
  "9869": "Do with him?",
  "9870": "Why could he not remember the name when he was told the first time?",
  "9871": "Vortex?",
  "9872": "What am I to believe?",

  "9876": "Do you wish to sleep with us?",
  "9877": "Sperrit?",
  "9878": "Why were those eyes so sunken?",
  "9879": "What kind of a legist is he who declaims when he ought to reason, who continually mistakes his metaphors for legal axioms, and who does not so much as know how to obtain a universal by induction, and form a category?",
  "9880": "Well, what should I say to the king?",
  "9881": "Is there immediate danger?",
  "9882": "Eyes of an admirable expression?",
  "9883": "But how do you make it out?",
  "9884": "Jack?",
  "9885": "And she?",
  "9886": "How did he get the money to buy this house, allow me to ask?",
  "9887": "Do you always draw like that?",
  "9888": "Why attempt to describe the terrible scene which ensued?",
  "9889": "Why, it is seven o'clock?",
  "9890": "You'll promise me you will do this for me?",
  "9891": "How many years have passed since then?",

  "9897": "Did you never hear talk of a young woman who was carried off one night?",
  "9898": "Should he climb the other ridge, or wander along the hollow?",
  "9899": "You do not mean that they have sent him to prison?",
  "9900": "How did he manage to buy this house?",
  "9901": "Was it a knell for his lost soul, chasing him through the empty streets and beginning already an eternal punishment of terror?",
  "9902": "What was he doing during that time?",
  "9903": "What is to be settled?",
  "9904": "Do you mean of dislike?",
  "9905": "If that is not a horror, what is?",
  "9906": "Who knows but this may be deemed right below?",
  "9907": "The sentiment is strong, then?",
  "9908": "Is your soul alive?",
  "9909": "Wildeve?",
  "9910": "And so you would explode confirmation and marriage altogether?",
  "9911": "You think I may hope?",
  "9912": "Do you know the young man?",
  "9913": "What means he, sir?",

  "9922": "Know the road at all?",
  "9923": "Will they not sign it?",
  "9924": "My husband?",
  "9925": "What's this about the girl you say is leaving?",
  "9926": "And the wager?",
  "9927": "Can you guess what it is?",
  "9928": "How say you now?",
  "9929": "Morrel, can you intend it in my house, under my very eyes?",
  "9930": "Why should he have got into any argument about the validity of these orders?",
  "9931": "What have you done to the man?",
  "9932": "Do you notice how it exalts everything?",
  "9933": "Think it?",
  "9934": "What good is it?",
  "9935": "Is it you?",
  "9936": "You approve of my going away for years, then, and never coming here again till I have made myself of some mark in the world?",
  "9937": "In this emergency what are the contending parties doing?",
  "9938": "Must they devour each other?",
  "9939": "What do you say, mother?",
  "9940": "Is it wrong to watch the kingfisher seeking his nest?",
  "9941": "Where are you going to now?",
  "9942": "We're on the right track, I think?",
  "9943": "Is he, indeed?",
  "9944": "You would not inform?",
  "9945": "There is such a person, then?",
  "9946": "Who in this universe?",
  "9947": "Or who would with any patience hear his friends, if they should presume to defend his government as not arbitrary and tyrannical?",
  "9948": "Once more, he said, what ruler is there of the elements of human nature other than the soul, and especially the wise soul?",
  "9949": "Then why not be more careful than him?",
  "9950": "You esteem her, sir?",
  "9951": "You are going to verify THAT?",
  "9952": "And yet?",
  "9953": "Get my letter?",
  "9954": "Why this great sin?",
  "9955": "Has he eaten today, or does he hunt empty?",
  "9956": "Why is there so little fate in your looks?",
  "9957": "Mind, my darling?",
  "9958": "On the contrary, does he not evidently perceive, that from the union of these points there results an object, which is compounded and divisible, and may be distinguished into two parts, of which each preserves its existence distinct and separate, notwithstanding its contiguity to the other?",
  "9959": "What part would they want me to take?",
  "9960": "And has your business been attended to in your absence?",
  "9961": "He's there, is he?",
  "9962": "I may use that freedom with your name?",
  "9963": "Chops, eh?",
  "9964": "But if you saw him so seldom and wrote so seldom, how did he know enough about your affairs to be able to help you, as you say that he has done?",

  "10359": "See us looking, now, at you?",
  "10360": "What remedy can there be for this situation, but in a change of the system which has produced it in a change of the fallacious and delusive system of quotas and requisitions?",
  "10361": "Was it this that made her ill?",
  "10362": "Excuse me, prince, but what are your arrangements?",
  "10363": "Do not whole scales of colors invisibly exist above and below the limits of our retinal sensibility?",
  "10364": "Have you ever had a difference with a dear friend?",
  "10365": "You came upon a private quarrel?",
  "10366": "What, if the idea should come to him in his madness that it would be well for him to slay his wife and his children?",
  "10367": "Oh, fie, now shall I just tell you why you came here today?",
  "10368": "To whom is it degrading?",
  "10369": "Where are you lodging, monsieur?",
  "10370": "But did your reverence hear of the portent that was seen last night?",
  "10371": "What do you say to that show of sense?",
  "10372": "Do you accept the commission which I have intrusted to you?",
  "10373": "Have I forgotten myself so far that I have not even told you his name?",
  "10374": "What was to be done after the crowning of the king?",
  "10375": "Have you not got enough corn of your own?",
  "10376": "We might ask, why it should be a greater proof of insanity in men to set a high value on rare tulips than on rare stones, which are neither more useful nor more beautiful?",
  "10377": "Is it your pleasure, most dear father, that you speak?",
  "10378": "And what will you do about it?",
  "10379": "The girl's name?",
  "10380": "And what have they promised?",
  "10381": "Mole?",
  "10382": "Did it do you any good?",
  "10383": "Which of your firm was it who called on me this morning?",
  "10384": "Can you get out?",
  "10385": "Have I to do with men of straw?",
  "10386": "Where was the monk going?",
  "10387": "Did we come up or down stream?",
  "10388": "The cave?",
  "10389": "Now should they undertake it immediately, and devote this day to it?",
  "10390": "Did the woman keep her oath?",
  "10391": "Why do you do this?",
  "10392": "But who can tell you the real truth of the matter?",
  "10393": "What solution will result later from these data?",
  "10394": "Then you were not merely jesting?",
  "10395": "How many and what dispositions were wanting to make 'em wise?",
  "10396": "But how had she learned?",
  "10397": "For their ransom?",
  "10398": "What else, sir?",
  "10399": "Is it entirely true that the vote has necessarily and really these inherent magical powers of rapid education for individuals and for classes of men, fitting them, in default of other qualifications, for the high responsibilities of suffrage?",
  "10400": "How, in short, reconcile what the progress already accomplished has had the effect of rendering irreconcilable?",
  "10401": "Is it a wreck?",
  "10402": "How much for?",
  "10403": "Your secretary?",
  "10404": "What in the world SHOULD it be?",
  "10405": "Then why inflict it on yourself?",
  "10406": "Shall I not have back the equivalent of his robbery?",
  "10407": "Where was it found?",
  "10408": "What did he give you for thus serving him?",
  "10409": "Is it possible that she has recognised me?",
  "10410": "Are you the boy whom I saw playing in the stacks last week?",
  "10411": "Shall I show you his apartments?",
  "10412": "Why do you make those grimaces, man?",
  "10413": "The meaning, monsieur?",
  "10414": "You really advise it?",
  "10415": "Then we will let it take its chance?",
  "10416": "You are aware it will be war, civil war, furious, devouring, implacable?",
  "10417": "What respect then can be paid to that which describes nothing, and which means nothing?",
  "10418": "And then what?",
  "10419": "What happeneth unto me?",
  "10420": "But, oh, is he on land or sea?",
  "10421": "And what are you doing with it?",
  "10422": "Fletcher?",
  "10423": "What COULD I do?",
  "10424": "How do you know it's not that?",
  "10425": "Is it large?",
  "10426": "Is this all your family, ma'am?",
  "10427": "Have you indeed decided?",
  "10428": "What are we to do with her?",
  "10429": "It seems then he bears a very changing sail?",
  "10430": "I say, have you got your mules ready?",
  "10431": "What does scandal signify to me?",
  "10432": "D'you know what sort of a practice this is?",
  "10433": "Ah, who, who?",
  "10434": "And therefore has neither more nor less of discord, nor yet of harmony?",
  "10435": "Let you be going down the markets, and what would you see for sale?",
  "10436": "And she had the right to live in your house and use your things?",
  "10437": "Pray where are their hens?",
  "10438": "Now, that is what he said, or to that purpose, was it not?",
  "10439": "What do you want with him?",
  "10440": "Or what usually happens, in case any one refuses payment of this tribute?",
  "10441": "What doth it profit a man to gain the whole world if he suffer the loss of his immortal soul?",
  "10442": "Her singing was less remarkable?",
  "10443": "Drunk?",
  "10444": "Are you pleased with what you have heard?",
  "10445": "Do you lock yourself up from me, to make my search more curious?",
  "10446": "Now, did the dogs act thus from the experience of each individual, or from the example of the older and wiser dogs, or from an inherited habit, that is from instinct?",
  "10447": "And a choice of what?",
  "10448": "Are you all right here?",
  "10449": "But what were these fatigues, what did the wounds matter?",
  "10450": "My business?",
  "10451": "What else do you hear?",
  "10452": "Not worth speaking of?",
  "10453": "Would the boat, however, resist more shocks of this kind?",
  "10454": "You will not fail me at the next term with the rest?",
  "10455": "He brings his right arm up, jist across his face, and passes on, with a knowin nod of his head, as much as to say, how do you do?",
  "10456": "Why are the birds all perching together over there?",
  "10457": "Do you wish to have an idea of their appearance?",
  "10458": "What is it for you?",
  "10459": "Of course you know that ambition and avarice are held to be, as indeed they are, a disgrace?",
  "10460": "What does a man learn by travelling?",
  "10461": "Then what is it for?",
  "10462": "As to the autonomy of the village communities, what could be retained of it after so many blows?",
  "10463": "A fear of what?",
  "10464": "You know that there is another man then?",
  "10465": "Is she still in town?",
  "10466": "Do you think that I would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death?",
  "10467": "When will he come back?",
  "10468": "How should she know his parts?",
  "10469": "And you were saying, sire?",
  "10470": "Have you got your thick boots on, and something warm under your cloak?",
  "10471": "How could we bid them hither?",
  "10472": "Well, how about your case?",
  "10473": "Speak how?",
  "10474": "And is not life to be reckoned among the ends of the soul?",
  "10475": "Why, who the devil should there be?",
  "10476": "Who slammed the door?",
  "10477": "What does all this mean?",
  "10478": "What is the good of such rules?",
  "10479": "Or had you rather forfeit your kingdom, your treasures, and your life?",
  "10480": "How are you going to manage that, captain?",
  "10481": "Did she stand the journey well?",
  "10482": "What's it to be?",
  "10483": "What business had she to go away?",
  "10484": "Why poor?",
  "10485": "But it had not approached the body?",
  "10486": "Where did you place it?",
  "10487": "Before the trial?",
  "10488": "My lord, you loue her?",
  "10489": "And what would you do in return?",
  "10490": "Ah, but madame, does mankind ever lose anything?",
  "10491": "Not heard of him, perhaps?",
  "10492": "Why do you come here to do this?",
  "10493": "The king's room?",
  "10494": "Am I a servant?",
  "10495": "Where's the clothes you run off in, you ungrateful robber?",
  "10496": "What do we do next?",
  "10497": "Had this mysterious being, whatever he was, whose existence could not be denied, abandoned the island?",
  "10498": "What will become of me then?",
  "10499": "He has confessed it to you yourself?",
  "10500": "What has the wretch been doing to him?",
  "10501": "To me?",
  "10502": "Then I hope your finger is better now?",
  "10503": "What was the sound?",
  "10504": "Is equality coming, or inequality going?",
  "10505": "Is there no such thing as a gentleman?",
  "10506": "What is your name, boy?",
  "10507": "But, sir, are you sure he is as guilty as they say?",
  "10508": "From where does she hail?",
  "10509": "Further, I said, has not a drunken man also the spirit of a tyrant?",
  "10510": "Why do you, a stranger coming into my rooms at this time of the night, ask that question?",
  "10511": "What did they want from him?",
  "10512": "Who shall still appoint what shall be discoursed, what presumed, and no further?",
  "10513": "How do you know it?",
  "10514": "And you believe her promise?",
  "10515": "Who?",
  "10516": "Tell me, now, if persistence is not a virtue?",
  "10517": "What, it may be asked, is the true spirit of the institution itself?",
  "10518": "Is this a theatre?",
  "10519": "You set me at defiance, do you?",
  "10520": "Does his crew drink air?",
  "10521": "Is not this your opinion, gentlemen?",
  "10522": "Did you notice that sort of flash or flicker the candle gave before it was extinguished?",
  "10523": "On our account?",
  "10524": "Have you studied the habits of hens?",
  "10525": "Is that the sun I see shining, my friend?",
  "10526": "How is it you do?",
  "10527": "Could it be possible that the place was peculiarly unpropitious to her comfort?",
  "10528": "Can they be coming at me?",
  "10529": "Snow at this time?",
  "10530": "What, can he steal, that you demand so much?",
  "10531": "If it was so, was she not bound to show her this letter?",
  "10532": "Suppose we all go away?",
  "10533": "And what is the engagement?",
  "10534": "At what point does deception blossom out into the unmistakable lie?",
  "10535": "Do you want any music?",
  "10536": "A ewe's a small thing, but what would you give me if I did wed him and did save you so?",
  "10537": "You pretend to be ignorant?",
  "10538": "Would you like to read a letter I had from him this morning?",
  "10539": "Did you get very wet?",
  "10540": "Did she see him often?",
  "10541": "Do you particularly like the man?",
  "10542": "Look?",
  "10543": "Is he asleep?",
  "10544": "And if each is one, and both are two, she will conceive the two as in a state of division, for if there were undivided they could only be conceived of as one?",
  "10545": "What could they do, did she think?",
  "10546": "Can I help you now?",
  "10547": "How do they live?",
  "10548": "This beast, I rather conclude, friend, is not of home raising, but is from foreign lands, or perhaps from the little island itself over the blue water?",
  "10549": "Do they hop?",
  "10550": "What's wrong with me?",
  "10551": "Would it not then have been the same if he had died of a fever or of the small pox, of old age, or of anything else?",
  "10552": "In order not to involve the social wealth in an unlimited and consequently disastrous solidarity, will they content themselves with imposing rules upon the spirit of invention and enterprise?",
  "10553": "Is not that a perfect and lofty love?",
  "10554": "But was she here when the lady came?",
  "10555": "Do I talk nonsense if I wish to recover my money?",
  "10556": "Are these plains composed of arid sand, as the first astronomer maintained?",
  "10557": "Alive and well?",
  "10558": "You have some plan, then?",
  "10559": "How could he answer to such an appeal?",
  "10560": "Do you think the poison he fell a victim to was intended for him?",
  "10561": "Shall we get on with our work?",
  "10562": "Mean to say he knowed nothing of you?",
  "10563": "Have you lost your wits?",
  "10564": "What wreck?",
  "10565": "Would you be good enough to turn your face to the window?",
  "10566": "And why had I these aspirations and these regrets?",
  "10567": "So you have a lodging?",
  "10568": "Go away with you?",
  "10569": "This is not your writing?",
  "10570": "For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?",
  "10571": "Who told me to love her?",
  "10572": "And is that all you can say for him?",
  "10573": "Do you think it would be worth a week's wages?",
  "10574": "When is the time?",
  "10575": "What is this, my dear?",
  "10576": "What if I were to try such and such a thing?",
  "10577": "Do you think the countess would mind my having or two of them here if I were to ask her?",
  "10578": "How can she conceal the intrigue from other people's eyes?",
  "10579": "And the persons whose property is taken from them are compelled to defend themselves before the people as they best can?",
  "10580": "Do they, when they put to flight, as it is said, disorders that have baffled the powers of medicine, work in conformity to the light of reason?",
  "10581": "Have you the keys to those two doors?",
  "10582": "You understand that, I hope?",
  "10583": "Who is happy?",
  "10584": "And, if natural, may it not be assumed to be proper and right?",
  "10585": "Who talks of dying?",
  "10586": "Can they be saved when the army has gone?",
  "10587": "Can it harm my lover for me to live on after he is dead, if I take no pleasure in anything but in the woe I bear for him?",
  "10588": "Will you only say that you have been mistaken, and that I may depend on your not acting secretly in future?",
  "10589": "Was it for this, however, that his visits to the farm formed a delightful exception to the meagre occupations of his life?",
  "10590": "An instance?",
  "10591": "But will you go with me to gain the pardons?",
  "10592": "Will you stand upon your legs, you young devil?",
  "10593": "Did she object to it?",
  "10594": "And if her ships are not to be admitted into our harbours, I would ask, how is she to protect us?",
  "10595": "May I hope it?",
  "10596": "Must you really go now?",
  "10597": "And the more detestable his actions are to the citizens the more satellites and the greater devotion in them will he require?",
  "10598": "I suppose it could be managed somehow?",
  "10599": "Have you made him any promise that I must ratify?",
  "10600": "Am I not interrupting your conversation?",
  "10601": "Have you no fears lest your conduct should be misinterpreted?",
  "10602": "The big cake or the little deadlies?",
  "10603": "Will you swear to sacrifice even your lives in their defense, and to keep them always by your valor in the path to victory?",
  "10604": "Anything moving in the old place, mid I ask?",
  "10605": "Are you going to leave me?",
  "10606": "Surely you are mistaken about his trade?",
  "10607": "Can this be it?",
  "10608": "Lemonade, sir?",
  "10609": "Have I not shown my power?",
  "10610": "And how can she do so if, up to this minute, by your own statement, she is herself in ignorance of your knowledge?",
  "10611": "What do we know of the beauty they replace?",
  "10612": "Am I still superintendent?",
  "10613": "Why, what is there so terrific in the cavern?",
  "10614": "Then where did papa get it?",
  "10615": "Then, it is your opinion that our friend has perished in the waves?",
  "10616": "Do you really forgive me?",
  "10617": "What do I say?",
  "10618": "Did I frighten you so much?",
  "10619": "Are you here before me?",
  "10620": "But ought we to attempt to construct one?",
  "10621": "And she knows nothing of it?",
  "10622": "Have you seen a ooser?",
  "10623": "How do you know that?",
  "10624": "What, are you ready there?",
  "10625": "What do you want with her, boy?",
  "10626": "You know the hunt and chase?",
  "10627": "You at last?",
  "10628": "On your word, now?",
  "10629": "But, it will be asked, what kind of a treasure is this that we propose to bequeath to posterity?",
  "10630": "How do you get at that?",
  "10631": "Frank?",
  "10632": "Are you strong enough?",
  "10633": "Now, I want to hear you swear that you are not married to that woman?",
  "10634": "But what, then, is the noise?",
  "10635": "How did you conceive that idea?",
  "10636": "Now, do it look like it?",
  "10637": "Where can they be?",
  "10638": "Was he considering what pallet, what brushes, what canvas he must use, to introduce them into visible life through his art?",
  "10639": "Can you spare me a very few minutes?",
  "10640": "Has the sly old fox made his fortune then, and gone to live in a tranquil cot in a pleasant spot with a distant view of the changing sea?",
  "10641": "What man would marry a girl so placed?",
  "10642": "To what end?",
  "10643": "Do you know?",
  "10644": "Or is it by the law courts and the judge?",
  "10645": "Whom had we to deal with?",
  "10646": "And yet there was one thing wanting in order to complete your happiness?",
  "10647": "I hope there's nothing wrong?",
  "10648": "Have the private emotions also their gutter press?",
  "10649": "Yes, but how came you here again?",
  "10650": "Do you think there is a single person in the county who will not know that his doing is a sign that he has quarrelled with me?",
  "10651": "Are your doubts on that point too strong?",
  "10652": "Who you gwine to take to jail now?",
  "10653": "You, my lord?",
  "10654": "But who could help loving her?",
  "10655": "How so, if he love her?",
  "10656": "Was there anything unusual about the bodies?",
  "10657": "Would you be so good as tell us?",
  "10658": "Now, is it possible to reconstruct the series from which money seems to have been detached, and, consequently, restore the latter to its true principle?",
  "10659": "Have you been studying much law lately?",
  "10660": "You told her that?",
  "10661": "And is it your cook who prepares these pills?",
  "10662": "Or do I have to hit you again?",
  "10663": "What are you giggling at?",
  "10664": "Does anybody believe it?",
  "10665": "Is it wrong to watch the moon, the stars?",
  "10666": "Does anyone know him by sight?",
  "10667": "Would she part with privileges which, once relinquished, could never be regained?",
  "10668": "Why should it be forgotten?",
  "10669": "Are you still sure to close up?",
  "10670": "You'll know our light porter again?",
  "10671": "Is it a good road?",
  "10672": "Am I to let the troops have the oats, and to take a receipt for them?",
  "10673": "Had he in his turn succumbed?",
  "10674": "Anna, what is it for, why will you?",
  "10675": "Philanthropic?",
  "10676": "You remember what people say when they are sick?",
  "10677": "Do you often have this housewarming?",
  "10678": "There are forty years of work in me yet, and why should you despair?",
  "10679": "A tree?",
  "10680": "Are we going to tell him still that politics is a disreputable and useless form of human activity?",
  "10681": "Would you like some nice little part with the infant?",
  "10682": "And is it not needed whenever it helps us and hurts the enemy?",
  "10683": "If you put a question to a person in a right way, he will give a true answer of himself, but how could he do this unless there were knowledge and right reason already in him?",
  "10684": "Was he here this morning?",
  "10685": "Have you posts of profitable pecuniary emolument?",
  "10686": "How could such a state of things be kept secret?",
  "10687": "And do you still deem it a part of valor to die?",
  "10688": "But not about all?",
  "10689": "But is this really true, as you say it now?",
  "10690": "Had you any idea of his coming so soon?",
  "10691": "Did I not forbid you to show your face here for month?",
  "10692": "And am I not to learn his name?",
  "10693": "But what did it matter?",
  "10694": "So that now?",
  "10695": "Has she softened or hardened?",
  "10696": "We shall follow one or the other of these curves?",
  "10697": "How many other girls did you ever tell that?",
  "10698": "Will you hear me say but one word?",
  "10699": "Whether it was a criminal act that I had committed?",
  "10700": "Your head is cool?",
  "10701": "Was it, sir?",
  "10702": "Verver?",
  "10703": "What's that he said?",
  "10704": "Shall they be admitted?",
  "10705": "Why did you quarrel?",
  "10706": "Have you been a soldier?",
  "10707": "Is not this an insult, pray?",
  "10708": "I believe it was you, unless I have had the bad luck to mistake the person in following?",
  "10709": "What can they have meant by this howling?",
  "10710": "Where was he before?",
  "10711": "He had no other calling?",
  "10712": "What character did I act?",
  "10713": "What sort of man are you?",
  "10714": "Helen, are you mad?",
  "10715": "What will be my fate?",
  "10716": "Ah, then you at length understand?",
  "10717": "I call it time, but how long was it?",
  "10718": "Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place?",
  "10719": "What the deuce?",
  "10720": "What, my friend?",
  "10721": "I hope there's nothing amiss?",
  "10722": "Well, WHAT did I tell you?",
  "10723": "Do this look like a forge?",
  "10724": "To how much does the loss amount?",
  "10725": "Combat by regulations the degrading influence of parcellaire division?",
  "10726": "How's everything with you?",
  "10727": "CAN one have knowledge only of the past?",
  "10728": "Who may dogmatize in matters so involved?",
  "10729": "Is that no harm?",
  "10730": "You are awake, sir?",
  "10731": "But who is the clerical appearing gentleman with him?",
  "10732": "And how do you propose to begin?",
  "10733": "Will you walk out with us?",
  "10734": "Do you think it likely?",
  "10735": "Hasbrouck?",
  "10736": "You say that she had a squint?",
  "10737": "And, think you, when he saw one of your feet out of the stirrup, he would wait for the other to be free?",
  "10738": "Ever since her womanhood almost, had she not been persecuted and undervalued?",
  "10739": "Why does he always take the narrow streets?",
  "10740": "Higher?",
  "10741": "Then how can you say you did not learn to see?",
  "10742": "Jane, what is it?",

  "12996": "Is it there a friend to equality ought to carry the affections of a sensible heart, and who thus paying the esteem in which he is held, thinks he returns as much as he receives?",
  "12997": "How unfortnet do you want me fur to be?",
  "12998": "And it is not pleasant?",
  "12999": "What do we live for, if it is not to make life less difficult to each other?",
  "13000": "And who now fills the seat of royalty?",
  "13001": "To state the question more directly, are all the laws but one to go unexecuted, and the government itself go to pieces lest that one be violated?",

  "14044": "Why may not our country at some time average as many?",
  "14045": "Does it hurt?",
  "14046": "And what, after all, is the security which this training gives to governments?",

  "14061": "Thomas, you have returned, then, and your first act is again an indiscretion and a piece of foolhardy rashness?",
  "14062": "What caused it?",
  "14063": "How then could I unite with this wild idolator in worshipping his piece of wood?",
  "14064": "Have not some of the intriguers put it into his head that I regard him with jealousy?",
  "14065": "I hope he's not vicious?",

  "14072": "Yes, well?",
  "14073": "And why did you refuse, my son?",
  "14074": "Is that what they think of relationships nowadays?",
  "14075": "Why did I do that?",
  "14076": "Then you have some other motive unknown to us?",
  "14077": "Old?",
  "14078": "Then you would infer that opinion is intermediate?",
  "14079": "What other course was left to take?",
  "14080": "If the dream is not the same as the things dreamed, in what other form does it appear to you?",
  "14081": "Do you not know it?",
  "14082": "But have you not received my notes?",
  "14083": "Are the preparations for the games complete?",
  "14084": "Where do you wish me to go, madame?",
  "14085": "And who may this be?",
  "14086": "What if she's marrying me simply to be married?",
  "14087": "Which way?",
  "14088": "What about them?",
  "14089": "Would you like to know the opinion of a chronicler of the fourteenth century?",

  "14092": "Should he abandon his friends who were expecting him?",
  "14093": "Clever?",
  "14094": "And when's the wedding to be?",
  "14095": "What is all that about?",
  "14096": "When we had walked about a mile by moonlight, we perceived a horseman behind us, who coming up, wished us good even, and asked which way we went?",
  "14097": "Now, then, what did you do to your hair?",
  "14098": "Why do you pish, captain?",
  "14099": "And what would be the use of behaving otherwise?",
  "14100": "Cousin, will you any tobacco?",
  "14101": "Why not think much about this mansion?",

  "14103": "How do you say it?",
  "14104": "Who's been telling you that?",
  "14105": "How like you this?",

  "14112": "Is it really only negative?",
  "14113": "HIS father?",
  "14114": "Of what sort could a woman be who wrote such a letter as that?",
  "14115": "You acknowledge that as your conviction on the subject?",
  "14116": "And why should I?",
  "14117": "And is it just to assail, condemn, or despise them for doing so?",
  "14118": "Could her mother own it if she did?",
  "14119": "Now, can you?",
  "14120": "Well, what is there so astonishing in that?",
  "14121": "What, will he deal upon such quantities of wine, alone?",
  "14122": "Why, it may be asked, have all the most eminent living naturalists and geologists rejected this view of the mutability of species?",
  "14123": "Besides, what's the good of criticism?",
  "14124": "Do you think a woman could go alone at that hour to a bachelor's house?",

  "14250": "You have seen convents?",
  "14251": "Is he not?",
  "14252": "But how could it have been done?",
  "14253": "Is he at home?",
  "14254": "Sell this ring, a ring which comes from my sovereign?",
  "14255": "Is not that my right?",
  "14256": "You think he'd get after her?",
  "14257": "But what could I do?",
  "14258": "Ought you not to do as I do?",
  "14259": "Concerns me?",
  "14260": "Where did he stand?",
  "14261": "Be content, what do you mean?",
  "14262": "Will you now hold me free?",
  "14263": "Your excellency is the travelling companion of the viscount?",
  "14264": "For what advantage would result to them from this or to the whole, which is the special object of their providence?",
  "14265": "You are not going to the public meeting?",
  "14266": "Well, what else can I do?",
  "14267": "Marchioness, take a seat on the bed, will you?",
  "14268": "Who are your parents?",
  "14269": "And what person?",
  "14270": "You know what we're speaking of?",
  "14271": "What is the bargain?",
  "14272": "Embassadour, what newes nath vrg'd this sodain entrance?",
  "14273": "Very early?",
  "14274": "Is he handsome?",
  "14275": "Was he conscious of all that passed within him, and of all that was working there?",
  "14276": "Of course you stopped at your father's?",
  "14277": "How do I appear to people?",
  "14278": "Do you see anything to the contrary?",
  "14279": "Could he not turn his having lost all into an opportunity?",
  "14280": "What do you want HER to know how you are for?",
  "14281": "But is it true that I have but a fortnight of life left to me?",
  "14282": "Who ARE you?",
  "14283": "Must I do so?",
  "14284": "Well, then, why do you wish me to give up seeing such a man?",
  "14285": "You are sure he will keep his word with me?",
  "14286": "And is there any man in whom you will find more of this sort of misery than in the tyrannical man, who is in a fury of passions and desires?",
  "14287": "But why destroy my friends?",
  "14288": "What were the swans doing on the grass?",
  "14289": "Are you in pain, dear mother?",
  "14290": "For your sins?",
  "14291": "And they will take them on the safe expeditions and be cautious about the dangerous ones?",
  "14292": "You want to know what became of those geese?",
  "14293": "Then you are going with me?",
  "14294": "Who do you think that couple is?",
  "14295": "You think, gentlemen, perhaps that I am mad?",
  "14296": "Who is there, in the official world, that conceives the necessity and therefore the possibility of such a reconciliation?",
  "14297": "An arrest?",
  "14298": "Well, what would you do?",
  "14299": "Of who?",
  "14300": "Was volume or intensity the stronger?",
  "14301": "And love me?",
  "14302": "Why am I not free?",
  "14303": "What do you mean by a vacuum?",
  "14304": "And wounded, too?",
  "14305": "You understand now?",
  "14306": "Have you any water?",
  "14307": "The sea all round?",
  "14308": "Are you alone here?",
  "14309": "Where would you like best to go?",
  "14310": "Could it be possible that she had put on her summer clothes to please him?",
  "14311": "Who, then, my liege?",
  "14312": "What about you?",
  "14313": "Have I ever sought release?",
  "14314": "Do I turn doctor?",
  "14315": "How long did they remain thus?",
  "14316": "What, then, must be our representation of space, in order that such a cognition of it may be possible?",
  "14317": "What do these reproaches mean?",
  "14318": "What is the latest you have?",
  "14319": "Can it be that all this has happened so quickly and has destroyed all that went before?",
  "14320": "And how in the world did you find them?",
  "14321": "He and his two companions did not then perish in the maelstrom, in the midst of which the 'Nautilus' was struggling?",
  "14322": "Doth not the death of your kinsmen and all the hardship grieve the minds of you good knights?",
  "14323": "Did you meet him?",
  "14324": "Spos'n it takes him three or four days?",
  "14325": "Shall we see the king early?",
  "14326": "What can be done?",
  "14327": "What sailed in the boat, my daughter?",
  "14328": "What, my boy?",
  "14329": "Had he indeed the power to call from the grave of the past, the scenes which we have just contemplated, that he was thus able to clothe them with life, to renew their earlier associations?",
  "14330": "Did he indeed, now?",
  "14331": "What shall be done?",
  "14332": "Purposely?",
  "14333": "How are you now, my dear old darling?",
  "14334": "And what then is the name?",
  "14335": "WHAT poor knight?",
  "14336": "Had they carried back both of his companions with them?",
  "14337": "Would she not have been compelled to raise and to maintain a more regular force for the execution of her design?",
  "14338": "Could I live by it?",
  "14339": "Will you inform me how you carry on this establishment?",
  "14340": "Shall I leave you twenty guineas?",
  "14341": "Do I tell it, fur you to feel a obligation?",
  "14342": "Say, how much you got in your pocket?",
  "14343": "Was it not because I loved men far too well?",
  "14344": "And the crew?",
  "14345": "A great deal?",
  "14346": "How can it be night, then?",
  "14347": "Have not the ladies invited you to join them at the piano?",
  "14348": "By persecution or by force?",
  "14349": "What if his marts for business were gone for ever?",
  "14350": "What gratification can I have except the brandy bottle?",
  "14351": "Did these footprints begin at the water's edge?",
  "14352": "What does it matter now?",
  "14353": "And where is your mother?",
  "14354": "Cure the evil?",
  "14355": "And what if you should happen to cough or to sneeze?",
  "14356": "Do you mean she'll ASK it of me?",
  "14357": "What did the prince say just now?",
  "14358": "Shall I read aloud?",
  "14359": "Have they any will?",
  "14360": "Did our talk in the afternoon have something to do with it?",
  "14361": "What shall I do, then?",
  "14362": "You see this toothpick?",
  "14363": "You would like a glass of lemonade, sir?",
  "14364": "Do you want the tuileries?",
  "14365": "What was their sole remaining chance?",
  "14366": "Well, what does your instinct tell you now?",
  "14367": "There is no possibility of any mistake on your part, my boy, is there?",
  "14368": "Do you think I can wait when business is in question?",
  "14369": "Is your profession really so engaging and interesting as to absorb your whole attention?",
  "14370": "How do you do, sir?",
  "14371": "Shivering?",
  "14372": "Did she, too, pine for the lost rank, or rather mourn the lost lover?",
  "14373": "Perhaps you are his spirit come to revisit your old home?",
  "14374": "Is the young lady not with her aunt, after all?",
  "14375": "Why had these men come back after having returned to the camp?",
  "14376": "Has he come?",
  "14377": "But how does my sweet girl?",
  "14378": "Do you know what passed when I took him aside?",
  "14379": "Ah, how do you do, my dear prince?",
  "14380": "Of what do you complain?",
  "14381": "What if there WAS some one concealed in the house?",
  "14382": "You are her grandfather, that is?",
  "14383": "And in what way do you think you could be of use to me?",
  "14384": "Has she, indeed?",
  "14385": "Laziness?",
  "14386": "Was it I who wanted to take the road to the right on top of the hill, insisting that I recognized the road?",
  "14387": "If so, if she had been wrong to accede to that offer when made, would she not be doubly wrong to hold him to it now that she saw his error?",
  "14388": "Say?",
  "14389": "Do you understand this?",
  "14390": "Then you will come and dine with me?",
  "14391": "Why did you not pull the church to pieces, and bring the chandelier home with you?",
  "14392": "How was it you so suddenly popped up in front of me as you did?",
  "14393": "Why do you insult me by telling me all this?",
  "14394": "What woman?",
  "14395": "And do you think, my excellent friend, that a musician when he adjusts the lyre would desire or claim to exceed or go beyond a musician in the tightening and loosening the strings?",
  "14396": "Why does not he run?",
  "14397": "What could have passed between the two, what ailed the man?",
  "14398": "And CONTIN?",
  "14399": "All well?",
  "14400": "A fine fellow, is he not?",
  "14401": "What is that, grandmother?",
  "14402": "How would he feel when he met her again, in her poor ruined home?",
  "14403": "Well, now, gentlemen, is not that very alarming?",
  "14404": "What then became of me?",
  "14405": "How no rent?",
  "14406": "You sleep in this room, then?",
  "14407": "Where did you hide it?",
  "14408": "And have women, who have early imbibed notions of passive obedience, sufficient character to manage a family or educate children?",
  "14409": "Do you know her name?",
  "14410": "But suppose we HAD gone through the ceremony?",
  "14411": "Are you, indeed, going there?",
  "14412": "Well, is she there?",
  "14413": "Do you know will he be long, sir?",
  "14414": "Which side ought he to take?",
  "14415": "You were guarding me?",
  "14416": "Can he praestare fidem datam?",
  "14417": "Of monuments?",
  "14418": "Would she not tell you?",
  "14419": "Is it man or beast?",
  "14420": "Do you fly?",
  "14421": "What do you want among us now?",
  "14422": "Shall I respect man when he condemns me?",
  "14423": "What is he doing?",
  "14424": "Had all this, however, been even completely present to his companion, what other term could she have applied to the strongest and simplest of her ideas but the one that exactly fitted it?",
  "14425": "What shall I put you down for?",
  "14426": "Or what?",
  "14427": "What is your badge?",
  "14428": "And when the body is hungry, against eating?",
  "14429": "Is anything in me changed at all?",
  "14430": "What call?",
  "14431": "Upon what, sire?",
  "14432": "And now what are you going to do about it?",
  "14433": "But when do you expect to go?",
  "14434": "Are you in pain?",
  "14435": "Can you not tell when a warning is for your own good?",
  "14436": "And who can have done it but I?",
  "14437": "Well, sir, is not a substitute clothed with all the power and dignity of him who grants the commission?",
  "14438": "Are we not, sir?",
  "14439": "How should the individual choose his satisfactions?",
  "14440": "And who has filled your head with all this nonsense?",
  "14441": "You got your mother's letter?",
  "14442": "This looks well, eh?",
  "14443": "Well, and how are you my buck?",
  "14444": "Was not an early death his certain fate?",
  "14445": "And how did you manage to make them so grand, exalted, and brave with your wonderful verse?",
  "14446": "You wish to know what I will do?",
  "14447": "Tell me, at least, who you are?",
  "14448": "What shall be our excuse with the king?",
  "14449": "But is this really so?",
  "14450": "Have I called you down from the stars?",
  "14451": "For how much?",
  "14452": "But what do you want with me?",
  "14453": "Is not that quite enough?",
  "14454": "Say he need not lose his children and his wife, will he love you for that more than one who knows he well deserved the loss?",
  "14455": "Or had it transformed itself into this man, and what did the whole thing mean?",
  "14456": "Do you know anything of the commissionnaire?",
  "14457": "Through marriage?",
  "14458": "And do you impute it to either of those?",
  "14459": "Is she not perhaps still a married woman with a living husband?",
  "14460": "Is there never another to be found in the world?",
  "14461": "What's that, captain?",
  "14462": "Did you ever spend a quieter night in our little house at Königsberg?",
  "14463": "In nailing up the coffin?",
  "14464": "Have you enough till I come back?",
  "14465": "Are they better than gold pieces?",
  "14466": "Wel, what of him?",
  "14467": "Why all these complaints?",
  "14468": "If he does not boast of his deeds, who will?",
  "14469": "I am only asking you, is it worth it?",
  "14470": "Tom, have you anything to tell me?",
  "14471": "A gift?",
  "14472": "But, my dear, will you not give us a little hope of touching this heart, so kind and generous?",
  "14473": "Then why do you keep thinking about it?",
  "14474": "What's the use of talking?",
  "14475": "Has he?",
  "14476": "What say you then?",
  "14477": "Do you reflect that all those words will be branded in my memory, and eating deeper eternally after you have left me?",
  "14478": "What example?",
  "14479": "Do you know him personally?",
  "14480": "You cannot mean to shoot me?",
  "14481": "Why does he never write?",
  "14482": "If I go out of and beyond the conception A, in order to recognize another B as connected with it, what foundation have I to rest on, whereby to render the synthesis possible?",
  "14483": "Does it, in fine, consist in the greater obstacles opposed to the concert and accomplishment of the secret wishes of an unjust and interested majority?",
  "14484": "Why did she seem so abstracted?",
  "14485": "The pony?",
  "14486": "What men be ye?",
  "14487": "Who had done this?",
  "14488": "Are we, then, speeding forward to some cataract which will cast us down an abyss?",
  "14489": "For their soul?",
  "14490": "Why do you not go to the inn?",
  "14491": "What'll we do?",
  "14492": "Mamma, from whom was that other letter which you got this morning?",
  "14493": "Which one of you knows whether I have said it or no?",
  "14494": "Has she ever seen you before?",
  "14495": "What do they matter to us?",
  "14496": "Must I be subject to this merciless villain?",
  "14497": "Is your roaguery become an office, with a knaues name?",
  "14498": "Did you expect me to believe you, princess?",
  "14499": "Would you seriously object to my bringing the child over here, with its mother?",
  "14500": "You've not forgotten all your doctoring, have you?",
  "14501": "How could you see her suffering and allow it to continue?",
  "14502": "What will happen if she is guilty?",
  "14503": "Ah, is there a secret spring?",
  "14504": "How did you get such a wee wee waist?",
  "14505": "You, eh?",
  "14506": "If people come to be pinched with want, and yet cannot dispose of anything as their own, what can follow upon this but perpetual sedition and bloodshed, especially when the reverence and authority due to magistrates falls to the ground?",
  "14507": "Turn them over to the captain?",
  "14508": "Job?",
  "14509": "You plie this geere?",
  "14510": "Only tell me, where is she now?",
  "14511": "The hansom cab one?",
  "14512": "Did you go far?",
  "14513": "To whom are you referring?",
  "14514": "Shall I tell you how bad a place it is to pass?",
  "14515": "Has he sent no particular message for me?",
  "14516": "Why do you then doubt of that which you know not?",
  "14517": "May it be told?",
  "14518": "On this rock?",
  "14519": "But the marks?",
  "14520": "Why should he not declare himself, or at least try to find some encouragement?",
  "14521": "What are you reading?",
  "14522": "Ithamore, tell me, is the friar asleep?",
  "14523": "And with whom are they to meet there?",
  "14524": "Or an inheritor?",
  "14525": "Tis not my son disguised?",
  "14526": "Whose injury is like mine?",
  "14527": "When did you get home?",
  "14528": "Who did that?",
  "14529": "You feel that, do you?",
  "14530": "What is the title of the book?",
  "14531": "And if one of your own possessions, an ox or an ass, for example, took the liberty of putting himself out of the way when you had given no intimation of your wish that he should die, would you not be angry with him, and would you not punish him if you could?",
  "14532": "You can milk 'em clean, my maidy?",
  "14533": "Are they overboard?",
  "14534": "But will that be long?",
  "14535": "A new disease, and many troubled with it?",
  "14536": "Vholes?",
  "14537": "Is that sure?",
  "14538": "What can I do with them?",
  "14539": "Under these circumstances was it possible for them to retain even the shadow of a hope?",
  "14540": "And do you mean to say, then, that you have had any acquaintance with her since you came from abroad?",
  "14541": "Want to set yourself up for a dandy, I suppose, and think that you must souse that speckled face of yours into every brook you come to?",
  "14542": "We could hardly pretend to be strangers, could we?",
  "14543": "Is the mind then, which, in proportion to its dignity advances more slowly towards perfection, to be treated with less respect?",
  "14544": "What story?",
  "14545": "To weturn at once?",
  "14546": "For which of us is there who could bear the whole truth being told about him?",
  "14547": "Those at the side?",
  "14548": "Take it, prince, and keep it till tomorrow, will you?",
  "14549": "You have been ill?",
  "14550": "You care about it, then, so much?",
  "14551": "Is he really heir to anything?",
  "14552": "Returned his wife mildly?",
  "14553": "On my account?",
  "14554": "Free them all and keep them among us as underlings?",
  "14555": "Do you repent of this sin, my son?",
  "14556": "What was she thinking of?",

  "14569": "Bulstrode?",
  "14570": "Who is that you say you are going to eat?",
  "14571": "Sulk at you?",
  "14572": "Is there any war now?",
  "14573": "What name shall I give, sir?",
  "14574": "Who can tell whether that heart, so coveted, is not common in its impulses, and full of alloy?",
  "14575": "Will you be seated?",
  "14576": "How are their relations to each other to be adjusted, and room found for both in the mythological system?",
  "14577": "Do you think it is time for us to enter the service?",
  "14578": "Whom was your letter from?",
  "14579": "Doth she ruminate?",
  "14580": "Or think his own worth impeached, by beholding his motley inside?",
  "14581": "What's the use of having a friend, if you must sling your notions at him in words?",
  "14582": "Was there ever such an impudence?",
  "14583": "Can you manage a boat pretty well?",
  "14584": "Are you strong?",
  "14585": "Vesenny?",
  "14586": "What can I give you?",

  "14594": "But, I ask, do you require that that knowledge which concerns all men, should transcend the common understanding, and should only be revealed to you by philosophers?",
  "14595": "Might they not still open the way of freedom?",
  "14596": "Shall I tell her?",
  "14597": "You know of course why I requested this meeting?",
  "14598": "You have met my wife?",
  "14599": "What do you fear?",
  "14600": "Now why did I not know you at once?",
  "14601": "Now, what about yours?",
  "14602": "And do we know what we opine?",
  "14603": "Have you never heard of the boss?",
  "14604": "But who are you?",
  "14605": "Is your life or mine going to be the dropped stitch in the great web of human life?",
  "14606": "He throw a rope?",

  "14624": "And how did you live then?",
  "14625": "Is there anything more dreadful than talking to one's self in an empty house?",
  "14626": "I that loved and you that liked, shall we begin to wrangle?",

  "14634": "But how can you be sure that the path you show is the true path?",
  "14635": "For when a man knows not his own first principle, and when the conclusion and intermediate steps are also constructed out of he knows not what, how can he imagine that such a fabric of convention can ever become science?",
  "14636": "Could we even tell what might occur during the march?",

  "15433": "Have you a handcart in the house?",
  "15434": "Is there no other child?",
  "15435": "What say you, lady?",
  "15436": "You mean to take your horse?",
  "15437": "And a man was with you?",
  "15438": "Can you hold on with one hand long enough to slip the loop of this rope over your shoulders?",
  "15439": "What are you stopping me for?",
  "15440": "Ah, cannot you read between the lines?",
  "15441": "What, therefore, is to be done now?",
  "15442": "How can you do it to me, boys?",
  "15443": "Shall we sling a bowline over the foot?",
  "15444": "Are we not to be friends?",
  "15445": "What would be its fruits?",
  "15446": "What shall you do with this poor fellow?",
  "15447": "Do you, while receiving benefits from me and resting under my shade, dare to describe me as useless, and unprofitable?",
  "15448": "Well, what do you think about it?",
  "15449": "What will become of us?",
  "15450": "What is in their kitchens?",
  "15451": "But for what?",
  "15452": "Driven to do it, were you?",
  "15453": "Are they the work of your hands?",
  "15454": "You are not an enemy of our holy faith?",
  "15455": "Did you get my message?",
  "15456": "But one can draw some hypotheses, I suppose?",
  "15457": "On the one hand, each laborer's task being short and easy, and the means for its successful accomplishment being equal in all cases, how could there be large and small producers?",
  "15458": "But in public who shall express the unseen adequately?",
  "15459": "Where did you stop?",
  "15460": "Tell me what this wretched war is for?",
  "15461": "Now, where has that nasty little beast gone to?",
  "15462": "Could we put off our wedding till a little later?",
  "15463": "What is that again?",
  "15464": "Is it my father?",
  "15465": "Who and what are they?",
  "15466": "You are not jealous?",
  "15467": "Because you think I must have so little?",
  "15468": "Art?",
  "15469": "And would you wish to see that poor creature's domestic hearth ruined and broken up?",
  "15470": "Cold?",
  "15471": "What do they want to argue for?",
  "15472": "What did he do to you?",
  "15473": "Who's that which snatched the meat from me?",
  "15474": "Nor anything at all, then, my lady?",
  "15475": "What was she?",
  "15476": "You will not be angry?",
  "15477": "Had he inherited it?",
  "15478": "Is there one who would not prefer free intercourse with her to high duties on all our products and manufactures which enter her ports or cross her frontiers?",
  "15479": "But what then must be done?",
  "15480": "How does it happen, then, that he is in your service?",
  "15481": "But what would be the use of my telling you of her lodgings and her journeyings?",
  "15482": "What do you need to cure you of all that?",
  "15483": "Oh, there's more?",
  "15484": "You have, doubtless, already guessed that I was preparing a surprise for you?",
  "15485": "How could I become cruel or vicious, when I had before my eyes only examples of mildness, and was surrounded by some of the best people in the world?",
  "15486": "Will you go in there with me and help get it out?",
  "15487": "Can sight adequately perceive them?",
  "15488": "Who is that 'Another' to whose greater good I ought not to prefer my own lesser good?",
  "15489": "Is it hard?",
  "15490": "Why is everybody pursuing me so furiously?",
  "15491": "How many of 'em do you intend to save?",
  "15492": "A client, then?",
  "15493": "Will you introduce me to her some time, if I call?",
  "15494": "And the dog?",
  "15495": "Did he call out because he landed in the water, do you think?",
  "15496": "What will you give me?",
  "15497": "Why do you not apply to them, if you stand in need of help?",
  "15498": "Have you the paper on you?",
  "15499": "You know about that?",
  "15500": "What use'll I be then?",
  "15501": "Can the inexhaustible have any right?",
  "15502": "And I put it as a question to those, who make a study of mankind, whether representation and election is not too great a power for one and the same body of men to possess?",
  "15503": "What have you been in with me for ages?",
  "15504": "And why was this blessed change?",
  "15505": "Or what amendment of your affairs will it bring you, if you do not now go out to meet them?",
  "15506": "And the general?",
  "15507": "Your three suits of apparel a year?",
  "15508": "What do you say, why not go after all?",
  "15509": "Unjust, say you, sister?",
  "15510": "And there you are, my partner, eh?",
  "15511": "Is that she, mamma?",
  "15512": "And you, count, have made this match?",
  "15513": "Have you the keys?",
  "15514": "What is to become of you?",
  "15515": "But have we great resources?",
  "15516": "Do you know who I am?",
  "15517": "Not even a reverend?",
  "15518": "I wonder if I've been changed in the night?",
  "15519": "Can you really then come if we start early?",
  "15520": "Do you wish to hear the name?",
  "15521": "Wickeder than usual?",
  "15522": "My dear fellow, what on earth is there in that?",
  "15523": "Love?",
  "15524": "Have I?",
  "15525": "What sort?",
  "15526": "How, sire?",
  "15527": "Can we describe in the same terms what is natural to man everywhere and always?",
  "15528": "The countess asked her if she found those words in the letter?",
  "15529": "Will you come?",
  "15530": "Who skinned you?",
  "15531": "Would you know why I'm thus, good people?",
  "15532": "But where, when, and how have they been arrested?",
  "15533": "And your duties here have drawn to an end, sir?",
  "15534": "How about him?",
  "15535": "But where are we to go?",
  "15536": "What limit would you propose?",
  "15537": "Any eggs?",
  "15538": "Why give rise to property, where there cannot possibly be any injury?",
  "15539": "Did I nurse you for this, that you should spare your blood on your father's enemies?",
  "15540": "But who resists it?",
  "15541": "You dance?",
  "15542": "Why then should you mind if men talk as you think they will?",
  "15543": "How, and when, and in what proportion shall aids of men and money be afforded?",
  "15544": "Tell me, sir, could you have the courage to do so?",
  "15545": "Oh, signora, how can you be so cruel?",
  "15546": "For who would believe my story?",
  "15547": "You'll be alone?",
  "15548": "But what CAN be done?",
  "15549": "Well, which shall go to left and which to right?",
  "15550": "May we not say that these desires spend, and that the others make money because they conduce to production?",
  "15551": "Why are you awake?",
  "15552": "How were they made?",
  "15553": "Do you really love me?",
  "15554": "You traverse the town and the streets in disguise?",
  "15555": "Do I bother you with talking about it?",
  "15556": "Who, then?",
  "15557": "Then, in general, those kinds of things which are in the service of the body have less of truth and essence than those which are in the service of the soul?",
  "15558": "But what is sovereignty?",
  "15559": "Now, what would you give him?",
  "15560": "Whaling not respectable?",
  "15561": "Too illiterate?",
  "15562": "Are you the same as we?",
  "15563": "What, have you made a passive bawd of me?",
  "15564": "Who's the man that says that we're all islands shouting lies to each other across seas of misunderstanding?",
  "15565": "Been under fire already?",
  "15566": "Who are they?",
  "15567": "But what is this I have heard about your intention of marrying her?",
  "15568": "How, indeed, shall I keep the crimson of my royal mantle always fresh and bright, unless I continually dye it anew in the blood of criminals?",
  "15569": "What has placed itself between us?",
  "15570": "How can one explain these physical sufferings and this morbid distress that were known for some time to his intimates alone?",
  "15571": "What sort of man is he?",
  "15572": "And you are sure that this is your husband's hand?",
  "15573": "Have I still a goal?",
  "15574": "Have they run?",
  "15575": "I think I am not mistaken?",
  "15576": "The facts are admitted?",
  "15577": "What do I care whether he is or not?",
  "15578": "Do you love him enough to wait till he can make a home for you, or will you keep yourself quite free for the present?",
  "15579": "Why do you trouble the man?",
  "15580": "Well, which is better?",
  "15581": "Will you come aboard?",
  "15582": "Is this possible?",
  "15583": "I ask myself, and I ask you, whether it is in our power, by any means, to avert the evil consequences that are only too likely to follow?",
  "15584": "May we say so, then?",
  "15585": "You are going away tomorrow?",
  "15586": "How are you all?",
  "15587": "And what brings you here, you jade?",
  "15588": "Could you pull a little stronger?",
  "15589": "About the dean?",
  "15590": "Do you think you've 'known' me?",
  "15591": "May I ask your name?",
  "15592": "But what's the use?",
  "15593": "Think I was going to stop on now I'm a gentleman of property?",
  "15594": "Why had she come out?",
  "15595": "For who would want to choose by rule?",
  "15596": "What do you say?",
  "15597": "After all, I'm not the first one to have a baby, am I?",
  "15598": "Not yet?",
  "15599": "Have you finished your repast, friend?",
  "15600": "But can we ever be in love with the former?",
  "15601": "Is it not strange compensation?",
  "15602": "Where did he go?",
  "15603": "For camping?",
  "15604": "Hall?",
  "15605": "Do you know what the result of that would be?",
  "15606": "Pray, what virtue do you attribute to a letter, which your speech might not possess?",
  "15607": "Can we fly, my friends?",
  "15608": "What should they fear?",
  "15609": "Was he about to learn at last who it was that he loved, who that young girl was?",
  "15610": "Some unique chaplet?",
  "15611": "Who is it that speaks?",
  "15612": "And where are you going?",
  "15613": "The one loves and embraces the subjects of knowledge, the other those of opinion?",
  "15614": "How can that ever be, father?",
  "15615": "Are you mad?",
  "15616": "Would there be any objection to my taking leave of any one I know, about here, before I go away?",
  "15617": "Why, where was you raised?",
  "15618": "Soon, sir?",
  "15619": "Had he hidden some of his magic tools underneath the floor?",
  "15620": "So late, is it?",
  "15621": "Would not the people start up in their seats, by a simultaneous impulse, and tear him down out of the pulpit which he defiled?",
  "15622": "Have you tried to drive a harpoon through a body?",
  "15623": "Did I perhaps learn from it the long clear silence?",
  "15624": "Have men, collectively, no whims, no prejudices?",
  "15625": "What did you pay for that meat?",
  "15626": "Or was it sensible?",
  "15627": "Well, what can I do for you this morning?",
  "15628": "You have money for them, for those loafers?",
  "15629": "Among those which grow lean which is that which grows leanest?",
  "15630": "Who's that grunting?",
  "15631": "What could we care about in the whole world beside, if we belonged to each other?",
  "15632": "To be in love is folly?",
  "15633": "Discarding punctilio and maxims adapted to more manageable times, and looking only to the unprecedentedly stern facts of our case, can you do better in any possible event?",
  "15634": "Had she not given all that she possessed?",
  "15635": "Shall we answer?",
  "15636": "Whose seats the weary traveller repose?",
  "15637": "What are we to do?",
  "15638": "It is really sold, then?",
  "15639": "What was the last word?",
  "15640": "Will you come with me if I win?",
  "15641": "Please, uncle, may I go on the river, then, if I'm not to go into the street?",
  "15642": "You probably know what I am going to tell you, or do you not?",
  "15643": "What do you mean by that?",
  "15644": "And you, monsieur, you were to obtain conditions for us, I think?",
  "15645": "Could you give me something to do for a few days?",
  "15646": "You like that style?",
  "15647": "D'you believe me?",
  "15648": "It was a troubled dream?",
  "15649": "Pain?",
  "15650": "Why do you want to know all this?",
  "15651": "Did I say we could depend upon no better man?",
  "15652": "And what did you reply?",
  "15653": "How can he make out that it is a forgery?",
  "15654": "Your old original one?",
  "15655": "Pray, what are you laughing at?",
  "15656": "For that matter, of what use could it be to me?",
  "15657": "I suppose you've come from there?",
  "15658": "Is it to be the last?",
  "15659": "Well, are we all ready to start now?",
  "15660": "O, fear you the constable?",
  "15661": "What ship's going?",
  "15662": "What had tempted her to imperil both of their lives?",
  "15663": "Who can exhaust the possibilities of their combination?",
  "15664": "How does it go?",
  "15665": "Why had she toyed with the threatening catastrophe?",
  "15666": "It's all right, eh?",
  "15667": "And the bricks?",
  "15668": "Which of them will nationalize the other?",
  "15669": "Your reverence, whither away so quickly?",
  "15670": "If so, where is it?",
  "15671": "Have they heard anything against her?",
  "15672": "Is she very clever?",
  "15673": "To turn you out for?",
  "15674": "Do you wish anything?",
  "15675": "Irritability?",
  "15676": "Have you ever been arrested before?",
  "15677": "Come up?",
  "15678": "Who lost the tails of his coat?",
  "15679": "Who banged the door?",
  "15680": "Did I steal?",
  "15681": "I ask again, is that the way to test the soundness of a doctrine?",
  "15682": "WHEN did he sing out?",
  "15683": "Now, what do you make of four times five?",
  "15684": "Have we not here a picture of his way of life?",
  "15685": "What is it made of?",
  "15686": "Did you strike golden guineas out of solder, young fellow, or shilling coins itself?",
  "15687": "How shall we get down?",
  "15688": "Does it take long to get a nose, now?",
  "15689": "Otherwise, what would become of society?",
  "15690": "Surely now they would find a document which would throw some light upon all the mysteries that had happened?",
  "15691": "To listen, say I?",
  "15692": "You say yes?",
  "15693": "Pray tell me how it happened?",
  "15694": "Now the question is, after what manner this utility and importance operate upon us?",
  "15695": "What makes you a coward?",
  "15696": "But, do you know?",
  "15697": "Can you dispute the boundary?",
  "15698": "And now tell me, I conjure you, has not imitation been shown by us to be concerned with that which is thrice removed from the truth?",
  "15699": "But what use can I make of it, if it lies in your cabinet?",
  "15700": "Are you going to try to go around it, and land on the side turned away from us?",
  "15701": "And pray what am I charged with?",
  "15702": "What matter?",
  "15703": "What would you do, tell me, if your sister listened to such a proposition?",
  "15704": "How is this to be accounted for?",
  "15705": "But where are you?",
  "15706": "Do you not recognize me, unhappy child?",
  "15707": "Does it not look as if an architect had planned it?",
  "15708": "I suppose you know what you have got?",
  "15709": "Do you know its name?",
  "15710": "Even after marriage?",
  "15711": "Who is it, I said, whom you are refusing to let off?",
  "15712": "But tell me how is my mother?",
  "15713": "You do not admit the conceivability at all?",
  "15714": "Is it only a piatak that I am worth?",
  "15715": "But who lighted it?",
  "15716": "Had you never noticed them before?",
  "15717": "How will we mark that passage?",
  "15718": "Do you not comprehend?",
  "15719": "You knew, then?",
  "15720": "Yes, sir?",
  "15721": "And what is your theory of this poor fellow's death?",
  "15722": "And the world empty of people?",
  "15723": "Flask?",
  "15724": "But the verb, the verb?",
  "15725": "How can he be so?",
  "15726": "Now, would anybody think that this room contained a happy, merry party, who desire nothing better than to laugh and dance the hours away?",
  "15727": "Then how do you know about his rooms?",
  "15728": "How long had it lain in the docks?",
  "15729": "A person to be trusted?",
  "15730": "How am I to be prudent?",
  "15731": "Oh, you are?",
  "15732": "What have you got in that bottle you are carrying?",
  "15733": "Who can have so great a claim on you as I have?",
  "15734": "Was it not less than thirty degrees?",
  "15735": "Never a word?",
  "15736": "What man could have resisted?",
  "15737": "Was anybody any better?",
  "15738": "What is it in the nature of the child that causes it so eagerly to eat and play?",
  "15739": "Why do you talk to me of combining together?",
  "15740": "Where shall I begin?",
  "15741": "How does all that fit into your theory?",
  "15742": "Are you glad to go?",
  "15743": "Who, then, can calculate the course of a molecule?",
  "15744": "What does it mean?",
  "15745": "When shall you send your invitations?",
  "15746": "Now, the question is, do you know him to be one man, or is he really a gang?",
  "15747": "Where does that wedding come from?",
  "15748": "Has he at last concluded?",
  "15749": "To what young lady?",
  "15750": "How could he be otherwise?",
  "15751": "But which one?",
  "15752": "Where's the husband?",
  "15753": "What nonsense is this?",
  "15754": "What benefits accrued to the conquerors from the three fires which annihilated so vast a portion of the buildings and riches of the city?",
  "15755": "Had it gone back to the motionless bed of water?",
  "15756": "Then shall we try to find some way of convincing him, if we can, that he is saying what is not true?",
  "15757": "Which do you admire, then?",
  "15758": "Have you seen anything of them?",
  "15759": "And you approve of such a union?",
  "15760": "Did you look at these papers on the table?",
  "15761": "After the performance?",
  "15762": "Is it fear or is it anger now?",
  "15763": "Do you wish me to say it has merit?",
  "15764": "For a paper?",
  "15765": "What is the purpose of our feeble crying in the awful silences of space?",
  "15766": "And do you remember the word of caution which preceded the discussion of them?",
  "15767": "How does he demonstrate it?",
  "15768": "What, you are going to leave us are you, too?",
  "15769": "Let me see, is this a chair?",
  "15770": "How old was she?",
  "15771": "Could your conversation have been overheard by any one?",
  "15772": "Do you think I'm a'goin' to?",
  "15773": "Why should one?",
  "15774": "Could I help her, do you think?",
  "15775": "And what shall I say to the people?",
  "15776": "Done to death?",
  "15777": "Why should I give you my goods for nothing?",
  "15778": "I beg your pardon?",
  "15779": "Is she honest?",
  "15780": "Enough?",
  "15781": "But, independently of that, what would they live on?",
  "15782": "What is leaving one's body?",
  "15783": "A first motion?",
  "15784": "Who are you that knock here?",
  "15785": "What sort of lie?",
  "15786": "What do you remember?",
  "15787": "Of what use is this tax?",
  "15788": "Else why should he go hunting these wild devils?",
  "15789": "Did anybody order you to prevent that woman from singing?",
  "15790": "It has vanished, has it not?",
  "15791": "And who is best able to do good to his friends and evil to his enemies in time of sickness?",
  "15792": "INFORMER I?",
  "15793": "Yea?",
  "15794": "Why do I believe in cause and effect?",
  "15795": "Who's she?",
  "15796": "Yet what business had I with hope?",
  "15797": "Is that how one human being should meet another?",
  "15798": "Richard, how is it with you?",
  "15799": "And how was that to be turned into cash when there was no cabin on it?",
  "15800": "You would?",
  "15801": "With orders for my medicines?",
  "15802": "Goin' home now, boys?",
  "15803": "Who will be good and save the old man?",
  "15804": "Or do you propose any other punishment that will be more useful to the public?",
  "15805": "What does the booby stare at?",
  "15806": "Have you finished?",
  "15807": "In the first place did we not bring you into existence?",
  "15808": "Has she gone downstairs?",
  "15809": "Would they meet in it?",
  "15810": "Are you satisfied with him?",
  "15811": "Gad, how he did drop, sir, and what was it?",
  "15812": "Grévy?",
  "15813": "My word, but I WILL wallop 'em?",
  "15814": "Seek?",
  "15815": "But of what values?",
  "15816": "I suppose you're doing a little business?",
  "15817": "How moch?",
  "15818": "Was she someone you've never seen?",
  "15819": "Or is it the exhibition of your regard for loyalty to one's friends, and devotion by a citizen to the community to which he belongs?",
  "15820": "And if you are caught in a hurricane?",
  "15821": "Who are you dressed up in that way?",
  "15822": "Where's your father?",
  "15823": "Has he really?",
  "15824": "That he does not love you?",
  "15825": "What were we about to see?",
  "15826": "But admitting that these two classes of citizens are to be benefited by expansion, would it be honest to give it?",
  "15827": "How came the letter back in the box?",
  "15828": "But what will you make your omelet in?",

  "17855": "And if he refused?",
  "17856": "What have I that is not yours?",
  "17857": "But how could he?",
  "17858": "And why do you bewail my fate, when it is in your power to make me happy?",
  "17859": "Can there be loyalty which does not lead to the instruction of its object?",
  "17860": "What then is more pleasing or more suitable to the universal nature?",
  "17861": "Will you associate me in your investigation, or will you prefer that I should act independently?",
  "17862": "What are they, madam?",

  "18985": "Have you seen the new helmets?",
  "18986": "What do you want with that?",
  "18987": "We are to turn to the right, did you say?",
  "18988": "Simply in the end of the world, and grass?",
  "18989": "But to die?",

  "19001": "Where did you pick up the creature?",
  "19002": "No reports of any stranger seen?",
  "19003": "Are you not feeling well today?",
  "19004": "Have you no choice?",
  "19005": "Will you first let me speak half a word with this gentleman in private?",
  "19006": "Then what made her do it?",
  "19007": "But who am I to speak of the mysteries in the soul of a great woman?",
  "19008": "Should it here be pretended, that the view of convenience may be the source of all the right of succession, and that men gladly take advantage of any rule, by which they can fix the successor of their late sovereign, and prevent that anarchy and confusion, which attends all new elections?",
  "19009": "A pretty woman?",
  "19010": "Where are we going, dear?",
  "19011": "Rich, eh?",
  "19012": "Lasting?",
  "19013": "Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?",
  "19014": "But why do you expect that he will leave us anything?",
  "19015": "Is there anything at all on your mind now?",
  "19016": "Just for convenience' sake?",
  "19017": "What are you doing that you have to lie to me?",
  "19018": "Pray what more could I do?",
  "19019": "Why should I hint, and beat about the bush?",
  "19020": "Why did you come here, anyway?",
  "19021": "And what is better than wisdom?",
  "19022": "You do not believe me?",
  "19023": "But, as he said to himself now very often, what right had he to condemn her if she did nothing that was really wrong?",
  "19024": "What kind of beings existed in this strange boat?",
  "19025": "Do you like it then?",
  "19026": "Even in the last few years what changes can most of you not remember?",
  "19027": "What has he to do with my affairs?",
  "19028": "This a genial room?",
  "19029": "What is that sum, gossip?",

  "19052": "What is to be said to him, lady?",
  "19053": "What is the rope for?",
  "19054": "Not even your liberty?",
  "19055": "Do not great crimes and the spirit of pure evil spring out of a fulness of nature ruined by education rather than from any inferiority, whereas weak natures are scarcely capable of any very great good or very great evil?",
  "19056": "How many families that would board them?",
  "19057": "By the fruit?",
  "19058": "And you think him capable of being exact?",
  "19059": "Do you pretend to fight against the impossible?",
  "19060": "For what had happened only a few days before?",
  "19061": "Convicts, sergeant?",

  "19072": "I wonder why he has not come to tell me?",
  "19073": "What is he up to, anyway?",
  "19074": "Bourrienne, are we not old comrades?",
  "19075": "Is it objected that it is proposed to authorize the agencies to deal in bills of exchange?",
  "19076": "No damage?",

  "19078": "When we sum up all the useful truths which we owe to that philosophy, to what do they amount?",
  "19079": "Why, I said, what was ever great in a short time?",
  "19080": "Are you an officer?",
  "19081": "The university degree you never obtained?",
  "19082": "I wonder who could have put it there?",
  "19083": "Oh, that's what you are after?",
  "19084": "Gone the least bit beyond sniff and snaff at all?",
  "19085": "What is the news he brings?",
  "19086": "What is he, then?",
  "19087": "Am I to answer, then?",
  "19088": "Then what on earth are you playing at?",
  "19089": "But what is meant by this system?",
  "19090": "What sort of creature is that which approaches us?",
  "19091": "And you say that the same fate is in store for the earth?",
  "19092": "Would you give me the time?",
  "19093": "Well, I suppose it is time we were at table?",
  "19094": "What may that be?",
  "19095": "You consent then?",
  "19096": "It is a man, then, who expects you?",
  "19097": "And would it not be foolish to mourn a calamity above twenty years beforehand?",
  "19098": "What are you dissatisfied with?",
  "19099": "And their souls?",
  "19100": "What surprises you in that?",
  "19101": "Ah, so you know that house too?",
  "19102": "When that bunch got interested and planned to float the company?",
  "19103": "For what is the memory but a faculty, by which we raise up the images of past perceptions?",
  "19104": "You'll put your horse in?",
  "19105": "Was there no other way?",
  "19106": "Then I have leave?",
  "19107": "Why have you disregarded my request?",
  "19108": "The blue room is it not?",
  "19109": "Ambition?",
  "19110": "But I can hardly suppose that you have heard of my name before?",
  "19111": "Who made you?",
  "19112": "Are they only to be met with in the towns or cities?",
  "19113": "And what led you to form such a resolution?",
  "19114": "Why are you accompanying the army?",
  "19115": "Tell me, now, can you deny all this?",
  "19116": "What do they want?",
  "19117": "Well now, well, what's your own theory?",
  "19118": "What is there to declare?",
  "19119": "Can you tell us why?",
  "19120": "Who could have penned them?",
  "19121": "Who buzzeth in mine ears I am a spirit?",
  "19122": "What have you here?",
  "19123": "Why, then, do the supposed late continuators represent tools, not weapons, as of iron?",
  "19124": "Did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism?",
  "19125": "And what prompted your heart, my fair sweet friend?",
  "19126": "What did all this matter to her?",
  "19127": "Do you know what he has done, this child?",
  "19128": "Well, why not, if you're not afraid?",
  "19129": "Where do you expect to go to?",
  "19130": "And you've changed your mind?",

  "19133": "But who, sir, makes the trader?",
  "19134": "Is it that the level way through the desert is closed?",
  "19135": "What air?",
  "19136": "How can you let such things alone?",
  "19137": "But do you not think that the best thing to be done now is to openly give chase to these wretches?",

  "19145": "Excommunicated you, my son?",
  "19146": "Why do you not rally, and get to your work like a man?",
  "19147": "What more simple?",
  "19148": "Who wanted them?",
  "19149": "And who told you I had no affair with a lover?",

  "19151": "Do they do?",
  "19152": "Could you do better?",
  "19153": "When, when was this terrible affair decided?",
  "19154": "Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as my sister, how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray?",
  "19155": "And how am I to become his wife unless I love him well enough myself?",
  "19156": "Why, what's happened?",
  "19157": "And, after all, whose fault was it?",
  "19158": "How within it?",
  "19159": "There's no fear of failing, in the end?",
  "19160": "What did the man mean?",
  "19161": "He has not gone?",
  "19162": "Whom can he be shown to?",
  "19163": "Do you believe I am so great an invalid?",
  "19164": "Is there any claim that I can release or any charge or trouble that I can spare my husband in obtaining HIS release by certifying to the exactness of your discovery?",
  "19165": "What ails ye?",
  "19166": "Who wants me?",
  "19167": "Or till the soil?",

  "19174": "Can you handle the rifle?",
  "19175": "Yes, of course, but which rules?",
  "19176": "Have they, by some miraculous instinct or foresight, set apart in each of them a common place of residence?",
  "19177": "But still, papa, you'll have the dear old house and garden?",
  "19178": "Shall we meet again?",
  "19179": "What answer did you give your friend, sir?",
  "19180": "If we have been angels, why have we fallen lower?",
  "19181": "Came where?",
  "19182": "Any steps?",
  "19183": "If we can do so safely, why should we not?",

  "19193": "Whom does he consider disinterested?",
  "19194": "What bargain are you talking about?",
  "19195": "What is nobler than to succour those we love?",
  "19196": "How do you defend them?",
  "19197": "Colbert?",
  "19198": "How have I?",
  "19199": "It's very ingenious, and she says several pretty things in the process, but what's gained, I'd like to know?",
  "19200": "But who else was there?",
  "19201": "Do I look a sight?",
  "19202": "How can you talk about being like a book, when it makes even me, an outsider, feel sick?",

  "19216": "Why are you so unhappy, mother?",
  "19217": "And did you give me tobacco yesterday?",
  "19218": "For the last time, I ask you, will you reply to my questions?",
  "19219": "I wonder if he has forgotten the many unanswerable questions which he propounded to me so fluently on the day when I gave him my last lecture?",
  "19220": "Who is this?",
  "19221": "Suppose he did all this, what then?",
  "19222": "How is it with you?",
  "19223": "Who is that girl?",
  "19224": "What can she have said?",
  "19225": "Must I see my poor chile' go after all my hope to save her?",
  "19226": "Someone else?",
  "19227": "That conveys nothing to you?",
  "19228": "And how was he to meet her again on this very day?",
  "19229": "Who the devil prevents you?",
  "19230": "Then why will you not be my wife?",
  "19231": "In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?",
  "19232": "But who else COULD it be, my very dear prince?",
  "19233": "Do you think it would be unfriendly of me if I said I was busy?",
  "19234": "How old is she?",
  "19235": "WILL you shake hands?",
  "19236": "Did you ever hear of a dog running up a curtain?",
  "19237": "What is all my world after?",
  "19238": "And suppose he should say all he knows?",
  "19239": "Whether they are going to convict, or whatever it is, that dreadful soldier?",
  "19240": "Do you see this diamond?",
  "19241": "Why did he not go?",
  "19242": "Who was this man who held in his finger these curiously variegated links of an unknown chain?",
  "19243": "How much may not a few months do?",
  "19244": "What would this chamber of justice do?",
  "19245": "Well, yes, you are right, I am a fool, why not simply remain here?",
  "19246": "Are you going to shoot me?",
  "19247": "Oh, do you know that it is cruel never to name the name of the loved one?",
  "19248": "Is he quiet?",
  "19249": "A girl, is it?",
  "19250": "Shall a curiosity, which seems to lead nowhere, be satisfied?",
  "19251": "Was there no injustice in this?",
  "19252": "A dead dog, or rabbits, or what?",
  "19253": "Have you plotted to drown me?",
  "19254": "Oh, where was he?",
  "19255": "If I might make a suggestion, sir?",
  "19256": "What decision?",
  "19257": "Have you a mind to go ashore there?",
  "19258": "From number sixty?",
  "19259": "Or was the projectile nothing now but a metal coffin, bearing three corpses into space?",
  "19260": "What is the difficulty?",
  "19261": "How could you shut me out, bear it all alone?",
  "19262": "Would it be an indiscretion to ask to see those precious pills?",
  "19263": "And who is the cause of all this annoyance?",
  "19264": "After this, what more can be wanted?",
  "19265": "Tame?",
  "19266": "Will you take these mementos to him?",
  "19267": "And WHERE has he gone?",
  "19268": "But what is the point of it?",
  "19269": "Might it not be possible that the cheque having thus fallen into her husband's hands, he had come, after a while, to think that it had been sent to him by his friend, the dean?",
  "19270": "And what good is it to the bubble while it holds together, or what harm when it is burst?",
  "19271": "What are you going to do with yourselves after you get settled?",
  "19272": "Is that it, my dear?",
  "19273": "If one is not to get into a rage sometimes, what is the good of being friends?",
  "19274": "Where shall I put all this treasure, and which way shall I go?",
  "19275": "Why not mention these almost divinely childish sayings of kindness?",
  "19276": "Awake?",
  "19277": "Bucket?",
  "19278": "Is any rule more plain than this, that whoever voluntarily gives to another irresistible power over human beings is bound to take order that such power shall not be barbarously abused?",
  "19279": "I say so because what amount of persuasion could have persuaded me that there are apes in the world that can divine as I have seen now with my own eyes?",
  "19280": "WHICH one is the poet?",
  "19281": "What if her nerve had given way under the strain?",
  "19282": "What are you up to, little man?",
  "19283": "More powerful than my mother, then?",
  "19284": "You are convinced?",
  "19285": "Yes, why?",
  "19286": "Where did she live?",
  "19287": "Good?",
  "19288": "You love me?",
  "19289": "Why are you so impatient?",
  "19290": "Well, what if it is?",
  "19291": "Shall I ever forget the triple horror of that spectacle?",
  "19292": "Do you deny that?",
  "19293": "Will you turn the hay over to us, the hay in the old stack?",
  "19294": "But that way of arguing by imaginary instances is not supposed to be genuine, is it?",
  "19295": "Or am I going mad?",
  "19296": "What is the price?",
  "19297": "On what shall I reflect?",
  "19298": "So near, are we?",
  "19299": "And will it cost much?",
  "19300": "We are not wrong therefore in calling them necessary?",
  "19301": "Gentlemen, did you ever see a scorpion pinned to a wall?",
  "19302": "But what about the lamps?",
  "19303": "But then?",
  "19304": "And me, too?",
  "19305": "I suppose you gave a goodish figure for him?",
  "19306": "A surprise?",
  "19307": "Why cannot we launch into space through the scuttle?",
  "19308": "Is that what you wish for?",
  "19309": "Die for it?",
  "19310": "They must have been mistaken, surely?",
  "19311": "Absolutely?",
  "19312": "Is this the recompense you had in store for me?",
  "19313": "Shall I go and see if I can find them?",
  "19314": "Will you let me try to mend it for you?",
  "19315": "And for ever?",
  "19316": "You whom I regard as the last word, the last charming and delightful word, in modern womanhood?",
  "19317": "To avoid this dilemma what is proposed?",
  "19318": "Well, have there been reviews of your book?",
  "19319": "Kiss any of them?",
  "19320": "Would he really be permitted to lean on his father's broad breast once more?",
  "19321": "Have you had board and lodging too?",
  "19322": "Frequently?",
  "19323": "What might the staying of my blood portend?",
  "19324": "Mother, do you see this?",
  "19325": "Have you so soon forgotten from whom you received the foolish instrument you hold in your hand?",
  "19326": "Are periodical visits made to the grave?",
  "19327": "Well, now then, the count?",
  "19328": "Whether he had any accomplices, or whatever the thing is called in the law?",
  "19329": "You think it will come to that?",
  "19330": "Cut a man?",
  "19331": "But is there no mitigating circumstance?",
  "19332": "Who are these gentlemen whom you have brought with you?",
  "19333": "Anything down there about your souls?",
  "19334": "What can she do?",
  "19335": "Is there no remedy for this?",

  "19338": "Was the veil about to be rent?",
  "19339": "What were you saying to this youngster?",
  "19340": "Where have you been hiding yourself, you naughty boy?",
  "19341": "How dare you call me flimsy?",
  "19342": "For if the living spring from any other things, and they too die, must not all things at last be swallowed up in death?",
  "19343": "Had she betrayed him?",
  "19344": "Heart, what will you say if this be the appendix or label to both you indentures?",
  "19345": "Witty?",
  "19346": "Did I tell you to come around to day?",
  "19347": "You remember that fellow who came upon the evening before you left us?",
  "19348": "And you did not believe him when he said that?",
  "19349": "How can they?",
  "19350": "And always with the same lady?",
  "19351": "Have you read his article?",
  "19352": "So, then, they drew up the indictments before the king was taken?",
  "19353": "But eternal justice?",
  "19354": "Can you wonder I'm lonesome?",
  "19355": "Is it us?",
  "19356": "Then what do you hope for?",
  "19357": "Is it sweetening yet?",

  "19363": "When did such a massacre occur?",
  "19364": "Do you know the town at all?",
  "19365": "Is it because you love her so passionately?",
  "19366": "What is he after?",
  "19367": "Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison?",
  "19368": "Does this oath satisfy you?",

  "19528": "Why does your ladyship ask?",
  "19529": "Would they be naughty then?",
  "19530": "Was it a bet?",
  "19531": "How dare you come in so?",
  "19532": "But who was to lead the men?",
  "19533": "Or a sausage or something?",
  "19534": "Or was it some one who was with the thief who did it in order to prevent the crime?",
  "19535": "What period?",
  "19536": "Or are we going to hell for orders?",

  "19577": "No friend but you?",
  "19578": "Then you're a wizard?",
  "19579": "Are we enthralled with material things, less appreciative of the nobility of work and sacrifice?",
  "19580": "It makes no difference about those four crowns, but why did you get up like this?",
  "19581": "Well, well?",

  "20567": "Oh, where will be the end?",
  "20568": "Was that not enough, and more than enough?",
  "20569": "Is therefore that most honorable and most natural of our passions utterly lost, I mean the desire of liberty?",
  "20570": "How long since?",
  "20571": "But how is it conceivable that a nation should find its market clogged because of having got rid of its useless mouths?",

  "20612": "Why did you intrude here?",
  "20613": "Will you lend the money?",
  "20614": "Why should it be on this?",
  "20615": "How can she have, if the previous argument holds?",
  "20616": "Have you seen something?",
  "20617": "Was the islet invaded?",
  "20618": "Anne, whatever are you thinking of?",
  "20619": "And what became of them?",
  "20620": "Where is that written?",

  "20622": "Who's he?",
  "20623": "What have you found out?",
  "20624": "And yet, why should my heart be so heavy?",
  "20625": "That weakness in the legs?",
  "20626": "What is there to be afraid of?",

  "20640": "When they've even used, how are they?",
  "20641": "Now, does he do too much?",
  "20642": "Who can tell, who can understand, who can even faintly guess, what will be the anguish of longing which shall consume our very being?",
  "20643": "Door kept shut, did you say?",
  "20644": "You know who sent it?",
  "20645": "Our friends?",
  "20646": "Who'd you give the baggage to?",
  "20647": "Who breaks a butterfly upon a wheel?",
  "20648": "And all your servants gone to bed?",
  "20649": "What is the meaning of all these preparations?",
  "20650": "Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?",
  "20651": "He wanted you to marry him?",
  "20652": "What happens to them, then?",

  "20662": "Do you regard the condition as hers then that you spoke of a minute ago?",
  "20663": "Is not the thing feasible?",
  "20664": "Officer?",
  "20665": "What's the good of making us both unhappy?",
  "20666": "And what do you suppose is the count's age?",
  "20667": "Now what is it you ask for?",
  "20668": "Have not names and tones been given unto things that man may refresh himself with them?",
  "20669": "Was it not all true?",
  "20670": "Is it so odd that I should love your brother, whom I have known almost all my life?",
  "20671": "And what do you mean by an epidemic?",
  "20672": "I wonder if you really love me, after all?",
  "20673": "And have you settled it, as you call it, in opposition to the wishes of all your friends?",
  "20674": "Feeling better?",
  "20675": "Pray, sir, what man was that, with whom I saw you in the street last night?",
  "20676": "To come to the point, can we have a word with you in private?",

  "22147": "Can you still lie?",
  "22148": "You wished me to know the reasons?",
  "22149": "Or else, why did she not go out of the neighborhood, and get a situation where she was not known?",
  "22150": "Do you know that he holds terrestrial beings under his control?",
  "22151": "Has she been with you long?",
  "22152": "Or shall we say that they are in harmony with the apparent social will only, and really stand condemned?",
  "22153": "An explanation?",
  "22154": "What shall I be next?",
  "22155": "Where's the larder?",
  "22156": "Suppose a boy sauced you back when you told him to do something?",
  "22157": "Putting ourselves out of the question, what would you think of a girl who could engage herself to any man under such circumstances?",
  "22158": "As at present?",
  "22159": "What is your name?",
  "22160": "Whom have I hurt?",
  "22161": "Do you mean if you give in?",
  "22162": "Or have tasted the bag of the bee?",
  "22163": "For rich caparisons or trapping gay?",
  "22164": "Would you have it?",
  "22165": "What hotel did you manage?",
  "22166": "Where falls the balance of freedoms here?",
  "22167": "What sauce are they most dainty for?",
  "22168": "What will have gained by telling me all this?",
  "22169": "Is there not love in my heart, and constancy in my resolves?",
  "22170": "Were not the odds the other way?",
  "22171": "Did he keep any record of his cases?",
  "22172": "How often have I asked you not to take my things?",
  "22173": "Rank?",
  "22174": "How did it begin, when did it all come about?",
  "22175": "Where do you go?",
  "22176": "Well, what is to be done?",
  "22177": "Can you hear a mewing cat?",
  "22178": "Have you any opinion to offer, count?",
  "22179": "How long must we stay, do you think?",
  "22180": "What, gossip?",
  "22181": "What is the matter with it?",
  "22182": "But may I be allowed to place the mark for the second shooting?",
  "22183": "Have you ever noticed that all little children are blond?",
  "22184": "And that cavalier, that guest, that nobleman who arrived before she came?",
  "22185": "When am I to wear it?",
  "22186": "How do you communicate?",
  "22187": "Have you enemies, then?",
  "22188": "Which of them will you test?",
  "22189": "Would you really do that?",
  "22190": "How is your old fellow?",
  "22191": "What bottles?",
  "22192": "Could we not keep it as a secret?",
  "22193": "But proportional to what?",
  "22194": "How did you come here?",
  "22195": "What would these insects eat, if we did not pass this way?",
  "22196": "Your advice, then?",
  "22197": "From the monastery?",
  "22198": "Are you not meditating?",
  "22199": "Would you compel such a state of affairs?",
  "22200": "Then how do you know?",
  "22201": "Where must I sleep, then?",
  "22202": "Supposing nobody should ever fetch me, how long would they consent to keep me there?",
  "22203": "And I?",
  "22204": "Are you alone, madam?",
  "22205": "Vulgar?",
  "22206": "Is not this change wrought in your minds a very important change?",
  "22207": "True?",
  "22208": "Shall I run on and stop them?",
  "22209": "What sort of road would that be?",
  "22210": "Is it your intention to go to an hotel, sir?",
  "22211": "Agree with what?",
  "22212": "Shall we go this high very long?",
  "22213": "Up?",
  "22214": "Was it this room?",
  "22215": "Anyone shot a fox?",
  "22216": "Then what business is it of yours?",
  "22217": "Dishonorable?",
  "22218": "What is the steamer's name?",
  "22219": "Do you often go to see it?",
  "22220": "How is it that the convicts are lying yonder dead, in the middle of the enclosure?",
  "22221": "But where should she go?",
  "22222": "You would be afraid to draw such an inference, would you not?",
  "22223": "Why, instead of a revolution, did they not content themselves with a reform?",
  "22224": "Why should you say that?",
  "22225": "And had it ready a nice little pinch of salt to put upon his tail?",
  "22226": "In what direction?",
  "22227": "And why was this?",
  "22228": "Now, did it strike your ladyship that she was like anybody?",
  "22229": "What do you mean to do with him?",
  "22230": "Not caring for their lives, is it?",
  "22231": "Will you promise to sit up with me to bear me company?",
  "22232": "What are you waiting for?",
  "22233": "What bell was that?",
  "22234": "And with you, governor?",
  "22235": "How came the words forth from her?",
  "22236": "Have I not always fought for your glory and interests?",
  "22237": "What, after all, was this blood of which she had taught herself to think so much?",
  "22238": "How do you do?",
  "22239": "But could it be otherwise?",
  "22240": "Must I compel men to render her fitting honor?",
  "22241": "For who gets wealth, that puts not from the shore?",
  "22242": "You feel, in other words, that she lies to you?",
  "22243": "Who has?",
  "22244": "And what crime has he committed?",
  "22245": "And whom are you waiting for?",
  "22246": "Why not say so?",
  "22247": "Nine, ten, eleven?",
  "22248": "And it was a fierce one?",
  "22249": "What is it they 'ad of you, sir?",
  "22250": "What have you been doing all this time, eh?",
  "22251": "Well, what does that lead up to?",
  "22252": "To whom did he call?",
  "22253": "And what are you?",
  "22254": "Could he be dead?",
  "22255": "Will you be willing to leave your present situation and try?",
  "22256": "What else can we do?",
  "22257": "Had he fallen during the attack on his rider, or was he straying in the bush, or had the convicts carried him off?",
  "22258": "How can he tell?",
  "22259": "Is it with me or for me that you are angry?",
  "22260": "Then how is it that I seem to understand them myself?",
  "22261": "What am I to DO with this?",
  "22262": "Where dwell we now?",
  "22263": "Why are they always anxious?",
  "22264": "What man has authority over himself?",
  "22265": "Who attends to them?",
  "22266": "And now, monseigneur, your answer to this proposition?",
  "22267": "And that caused his sister to refuse my brother?",
  "22268": "And you think she would be angry?",
  "22269": "What news have you?",
  "22270": "And have you not seen any of our other friends?",
  "22271": "All I'd done?",
  "22272": "If there are other causes of poverty than competition, does that prevent it from contributing its share?",
  "22273": "Why should I deceive you?",
  "22274": "What is it you fear?",
  "22275": "Faithful to whom?",
  "22276": "Ah, but if you got nothing to eat for ever so long?",
  "22277": "A horror?",
  "22278": "Do you think I was sorry?",
  "22279": "What's the matter?",
  "22280": "What about the chair?",
  "22281": "I suppose you will live with her now?",
  "22282": "Of what consequence is it to me, then, whether he be grateful or not?",
  "22283": "And why should the goblins mind you, pray?",
  "22284": "What villainy is this?",
  "22285": "Blewett?",
  "22286": "At home?",
  "22287": "Why, instead of transports that should have intoxicated me with their deliciousness, did I experience only fears and repugnance?",
  "22288": "Whats he?",
  "22289": "Well, he took that icon home with him for a few days and what did he do?",
  "22290": "Why, we must ask, do you trouble yourself so much about death?",
  "22291": "How does your lady, and how thrives your love?",
  "22292": "The greatest affection of which he is capable?",
  "22293": "Wife?",
  "22294": "A pox, is this your inns o' court breeding, not to know your friends and your relations, your elders, and your betters?",
  "22295": "And what's her name?",
  "22296": "What are those we know?",
  "22297": "Now do you want me to tell you who you are?",
  "22298": "Are you dissatisfied with my service, say?",
  "22299": "What is the object of slaying the spirit of vegetation at any time and above all in spring, when his services are most wanted?",
  "22300": "What is there in your son's face?",
  "22301": "Gone where?",
  "22302": "What length of course do you propose, dear heart?",
  "22303": "In what manner was I protected by him?",
  "22304": "What do you like best?",
  "22305": "Is it customary, I ask you, to help to tenderloin with one's fingers?",
  "22306": "Do you imagine that a person can die like this?",
  "22307": "Have you received the orders, and will you act upon them?",
  "22308": "How are they called who follow others in spite of them?",
  "22309": "Do you mean that you saw the murder?",
  "22310": "Was it not then a man like you and me, who first proposed this law, and by speaking persuaded the ancients?",
  "22311": "A political one, I suppose?",
  "22312": "What, I ask, in that case, would have been your conduct towards her?",
  "22313": "Do I turn to the right, or to the left hand?",
  "22314": "And suppose he falls?",
  "22315": "An expedition, sir?",
  "22316": "Is it not enough to set him thinking about it?",
  "22317": "What am I?",
  "22318": "Do you believe they're his own?",
  "22319": "And if I obtain this son, the object of my most cherished wishes, this son who is so necessary to me, who will take my place with him when I shall be absent?",
  "22320": "But you're not making a mistake?",
  "22321": "Was you a party in anything, ma'am?",
  "22322": "The knight they went to?",
  "22323": "Ask him what?",
  "22324": "Have I done something for the general interest?",
  "22325": "Have they legs and chops?",
  "22326": "What do you mean by this conduct?",
  "22327": "You're not a skater, I suppose?",
  "22328": "With him, aunt?",
  "22329": "Why does he not come to me?",
  "22330": "Among all the unfathomable precipices which surrounded him, which was his choice?",
  "22331": "Mais, monsieur, is it not time to begin to take more counsel of humanity, and less of your courage?",
  "22332": "How shall I requite you?",
  "22333": "Or when he chew'd it?",
  "22334": "How do I know, my dear, what young men do?",
  "22335": "How can I regret when what I did was inevitable?",
  "22336": "Can you have the heart to do it?",
  "22337": "Was not death infinitely more lovely and noble than such a life?",
  "22338": "When shall I set out?",
  "22339": "But what is this on the chest?",
  "22340": "Where's mother?",
  "22341": "Shall we turn?",
  "22342": "And now, do you wish to attend to your letters?",
  "22343": "May it be that, in some fashion or other, you want me?",
  "22344": "Do you know that the least garrison is of twenty companies of infantry?",
  "22345": "Have these confessed?",
  "22346": "Do you suppose I've asked him for an assurance?",
  "22347": "Are you sure it was my house she was coming to?",
  "22348": "And what are those hatfuls of pence and halfpence?",
  "22349": "What does the change mean?",
  "22350": "Monsieur le comte had an enemy there, then?",
  "22351": "Where are you off to?",
  "22352": "Why should this be so?",
  "22353": "His son?",
  "22354": "Well, and what next?",
  "22355": "What, you're on his track?",
  "22356": "Do you expect them today?",
  "22357": "A parson?",
  "22358": "Now, in what sign will the sun then be?",
  "22359": "Is that the way you love your neighbor as yourself?",
  "22360": "If they hear of this, will they let it pass?",
  "22361": "But where are you going,' that you talk about bidding goodbye?",
  "22362": "So you hate each other?",
  "22363": "Do you go home to dinner?",
  "22364": "Tell me how and why am I again a prisoner?",
  "22365": "You intend to look after me, then?",
  "22366": "Is not my husband here?",
  "22367": "And is she gone?",
  "22368": "If he had been your own boy, you would have put him to it, just the same, I suppose?",
  "22369": "We asked who they were?",
  "22370": "Is there not one among them who has seen it all, and who knows it to be true?",
  "22371": "Or cold?",
  "22372": "Are you cold?",
  "22373": "What were the joy of man, what else could give him pleasure, but pretty maids and noble dames?",
  "22374": "Can you not be more definite?",
  "22375": "Who is she, or how did you get her?",
  "22376": "Tell me why you came?",
  "22377": "Or, shall we continue on our way?",
  "22378": "Do you hear the dog?",
  "22379": "Is his dog dead?",
  "22380": "With our business, how can we get away?",
  "22381": "And what is this?",
  "22382": "What will then become of me?",
  "22383": "Even in the midst of joy, may he not be permitted to be gloomy and oppressed?",
  "22384": "And what does his eminence think of this love, which is, by the bye, no secret to anybody?",
  "22385": "How do they act?",
  "22386": "Which do you like best?",
  "22387": "Have you seen the army?",
  "22388": "But what have I here said, that reflections very refined and metaphysical have little or no influence upon us?",
  "22389": "Fwhat?",
  "22390": "They grow out of our knowledge, ma'am?",
  "22391": "But could you think, because the nodding husband would not wake, that e'er the watchful lover slept?",
  "22392": "And the papers?",
  "22393": "Can you not come to me now, at once, before anything terrible happens?",
  "22394": "My card?",
  "22395": "Tell me, I beseech you, what ails you?",
  "22396": "Nevyedovsky?",
  "22397": "Where does your highness wish to go?",
  "22398": "Will not you, as well as your brother, intercede with your uncle in our behalf?",
  "22399": "Is SHE coming?",
  "22400": "Did you see her face?",
  "22401": "To love me, perhaps?",
  "22402": "In the first place, what proof have we of the fact?",
  "22403": "What are you trying to do?",
  "22404": "I strive to engage my uncle in my projects for the repair of the ruins, for the culture of those wide bogs and moorlands why is it that he turns away and looks down embarrassed?",
  "22405": "No right to be warden of the hospital, papa?",
  "22406": "When are we to discover them?",
  "22407": "Diamonds on the moon?",
  "22408": "What is your errand, then, with me, sir?",
  "22409": "Why is it that the dogs have failed to bark?",
  "22410": "And yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him?",
  "22411": "And do you think your power as great with the fraternity as monsieur le cure told me it was just now?",
  "22412": "And whose room is this, my dear child?",
  "22413": "And me?",
  "22414": "If that is the case, why wait till evening?",
  "22415": "What children?",
  "22416": "Lemme go with you?",
  "22417": "Is there any other point which I can make clear?",
  "22418": "ITS DECISION WHAT is a battle?",
  "22419": "Do you mean to say it's not of importance?",
  "22420": "Must I speak again?",
  "22421": "You are not laughing?",
  "22422": "Is there any news today?",
  "22423": "Or a fairy in disguise?",
  "22424": "Bingley?",
  "22425": "Let's see it?",
  "22426": "How, got the start?",
  "22427": "How many of such feelings were preserved from that subtle evaporation which robs them of their perfume, that gradually increasing inconstancy which lulls us until we forget to call the dying emotions to account?",
  "22428": "You are going to leave us?",
  "22429": "Wherefore should we linger upon it now?",
  "22430": "But you'll do it?",
  "22431": "Which of my friends, my lord?",
  "22432": "Are you going for a walk?",
  "22433": "What am I going to say?",
  "22434": "What, monsieur, will you leave us so soon?",
  "22435": "It not the blood in your veins as warm as his?",
  "22436": "Why was it useless to try to win any one's favour?",
  "22437": "But in the face of all of them, whose voice appeals unto me?",
  "22438": "Imprimis, he is older than my father?",
  "22439": "What has been the result of the first war?",
  "22440": "And you have promised?",
  "22441": "Have you the money with you?",
  "22442": "Dolly, why have you disobeyed me?",
  "22443": "So, that's it, is it?",
  "22444": "Do?",
  "22445": "Do you not see them doing the same?",
  "22446": "Does the lady go with us, my father?",
  "22447": "Never seen anchor weighed before?",
  "22448": "Do you burrow, or live in a tree?",
  "22449": "Where had he obtained that blouse?",
  "22450": "Sith then mine evil fortune would have it so, pray tell me, are any of the strangers still alive?",
  "22451": "Where's that?",
  "22452": "Some herb vodka?",
  "22453": "Nay?",
  "22454": "You hailed me, I think?",
  "22455": "And what do you want here?",
  "22456": "Is it a door with a lock to it?",
  "22457": "Is that honestly said?",
  "22458": "How could that be?",
  "22459": "And why should they not say so?",
  "22460": "Have you the diamond?",
  "22461": "Or the eastern?",
  "22462": "Is he aiming at doing anything, or simply undoing what's been done?",
  "22463": "Might he be called perfectly virtuous?",
  "22464": "But what else could she do?",
  "22465": "How ken I?",
  "22466": "Is such a hope justified?",
  "22467": "What man is there, even of those whom our age has called great, whose name, so many years after his death, could summon so many loving hearts around his tomb?",
  "22468": "What could I be to a man who had ever gained heartfelt love from a faithful wife?",
  "22469": "For your sakes or my own?",
  "22470": "Then I suppose that we ought to do good to the just and harm to the unjust?",
  "22471": "Philip?",
  "22472": "And have no fear of afflicting and destroying beings who are so dear to you?",
  "22473": "When is property satisfied?",
  "22474": "If the public felt that their wills were in safe keeping, and took it for granted that the office was not to be made better, who was the worse for it?",
  "22475": "How can the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall?",
  "22476": "How dare you?",
  "22477": "What about capitulation?",
  "22478": "Then would he descend to the south?",
  "22479": "Had he come home?",
  "22480": "All these days?",
  "22481": "Take fifty roubles for your cloak?",
  "22482": "Well, is she going to stay with him all day?",
  "22483": "What would it be?",
  "22484": "How will you forgive all my roughness in former days?",
  "22485": "By looks only?",
  "22486": "If I desert her, sir, do you suppose she forgets me?",
  "22487": "Will your majesty permit me to give orders in your name throughout this business?",
  "22488": "You never HAVE entertained it?",
  "22489": "What steps will you take?",
  "22490": "In a private car?",
  "22491": "The pretty little widow?",
  "22492": "Whither are we flying?",
  "22493": "Would anyone call you an old friend of mine?",
  "22494": "Then what conclusion may be drawn?",
  "22495": "Where did you get it?",
  "22496": "For what advantage would result to them from this or to the whole, which is the special object of their providence?",
  "22497": "Is this all of you tonight?",
  "22498": "Is't not admirable?",
  "22499": "Lucien?",
  "22500": "Is he worse?",
  "22501": "Be they of much import?",
  "22502": "Is it for this reason, pray, that you have also lost your cloak?",
  "22503": "Will your eminence be angry if I read you a lesson?",
  "22504": "His manners, I think, you said are not to your taste?",
  "22505": "What call was there to press it on so eagerly?",
  "22506": "And if he had judged her harshly?",
  "22507": "In what do I need help?",
  "22508": "Have I no friend that will make her drunk?",
  "22509": "How old, sir, said I, is miss?",
  "22510": "Whether the fruits of his labours shall be enjoyed by himself or consumed by the profligacy of governments?",
  "22511": "Dull now?",
  "22512": "How long?",
  "22513": "And with all this, does life offer aught substantial, aught that is lasting?",
  "22514": "Was he contemplating the abandonment of his plans?",
  "22515": "Is the steam full on?",
  "22516": "Where was it?",
  "22517": "Have done with what?",
  "22518": "Are we to leave them to overrun our forests, our fields, our plantations?",
  "22519": "What do you think of them?",
  "22520": "That one?",
  "22521": "How did she look when she was reading my letter?",
  "22522": "And what can they be?",
  "22523": "You see, do you?",
  "22524": "What house is this?",
  "22525": "What have you been up to now, I should like to know?",
  "22526": "Are you?",
  "22527": "Did you eat it all?",
  "22528": "I assume that you would not accept my word for anything?",
  "22529": "Gentlemen, how does the case stand, upon the present occasion?",
  "22530": "Dare any soul on earth breathe a word against the sweetest, the purest, the tenderest, the most angelical of young women?",
  "22531": "Come, tell me, what is the joke?",
  "22532": "You know that I know all the news?",
  "22533": "How do you mean, settled?",
  "22534": "How can one see all this and not feel sad?",
  "22535": "Have you shown this letter to any one?",
  "22536": "When did he come here?",
  "22537": "They were just beginning to speak of his journey, when casting his eye on the small table he asked in a sharp tone, what lad that was?",
  "22538": "Were you happy in prison, dear child?",
  "22539": "And has she been out since?",
  "22540": "Where did I go?",
  "22541": "Well, you rascal, what is it?",
  "22542": "Now do you see anything upon that knee bone?",
  "22543": "Who is that complaining?",

  "22936": "Well, what could this do but stimulate his humour?",
  "22937": "What now?",
  "22938": "And this is?",
  "22939": "Is it really you?",
  "22940": "Beyond man, forsooth?",
  "22941": "For what purpose a chaplet?",
  "22942": "Were the figures in the mysterious documents correct?",
  "22943": "Must you go?",
  "22944": "He's told 'ee what's happened to us, I suppose?",
  "22945": "But then, why did you ask me how many sweethearts I had had?",
  "22946": "Are you afraid of the sea?",
  "22947": "Are you sure, in her conversation with you, that your wife mentioned no names?",
  "22948": "Till then, then?",
  "22949": "How can you torture me and yourself like that, for a mere fancy?",
  "22950": "What was the meaning of it all?",
  "22951": "She ought not, ought she?",
  "22952": "But what was she to say on the present moment?",
  "22953": "How many ages had the rains and the stream been at work to scoop out from the flat tableland this deep and broad valley?",
  "22954": "What had these women done?",
  "22955": "And the virtue which enters into this competition is justice?",
  "22956": "Whither do you intend going?",
  "22957": "How do you suppose he is feeling?",
  "22958": "What monster can possibly fill itself with such a quantity of water, and spurt it up so continuously?",
  "22959": "Where's she off to?",
  "22960": "Where do you yourself come from?",
  "22961": "Now, monsieur le cardinal, did he not bring me up, did he not support me?",
  "22962": "But how could he know anything of it?",
  "22963": "And by contracts you mean partnerships?",
  "22964": "What, in its true sense, is a holy life?",
  "22965": "But is it fair to leave the job I got you and come to me for another?",
  "22966": "And you ARE a beadle, are you not?",
  "22967": "You asked when?",
  "22968": "Did any one ever see a capitalist, weary of gain, conspiring for the general good and making the emancipation of the proletariat his last speculation?",
  "22969": "Before what?",
  "22970": "In what adventure?",
  "22971": "Will aggression cease?",
  "22972": "As to sparing the girl, of what importance or value is she?",
  "22973": "Do you think the fellow was bashful?",
  "22974": "Is there anything else to correct in the history, senor bachelor?",
  "22975": "If they had come hand in hand all the way through life, with no memories behind them but those which belonged to each other?",
  "22976": "Could there be some being hidden in its profoundest recesses?",
  "22977": "Will you ruin your life and my own for the sake of this promise?",
  "22978": "But what is the treasure, then?",
  "22979": "You think women never can keep secrets, I suppose?",
  "22980": "D'you think they're rotten?",
  "22981": "When it came to be looked into, it was all a matter of the life and death of one woman, to wit me myself, and why should she not live, why should she not sit upon the throne with the man who loved her?",
  "22982": "What place is he to go to?",
  "22983": "Have you something to tell me?",
  "22984": "Did you say pig, or fig?",
  "22985": "And even if they did arrest me for being here, what would it matter?",
  "22986": "What did it matter?",
  "22987": "Which is yours?",
  "22988": "What was this figure of the shadows which had for its only object the preservation of the rising of a star from every shadow and from every cloud?",
  "22989": "Were you walking alone, may I ask?",
  "22990": "Now which is the worse defect?",
  "22991": "Why wonder?",
  "22992": "The anchorage is on the south, behind an islet, I fancy?",
  "22993": "Symbol of departure or of loneliness?",
  "22994": "Is it possible to have much respect for a system of education that thus insults reason and nature?",
  "22995": "And fell I not downright?",
  "22996": "Out?",
  "22997": "You can understand my feelings, can you not, monsieur?",
  "22998": "Why do you keep laughing at me?",
  "22999": "How shall they settle the dispute, since neither is able to make his assertions directly comprehensible and certain, but must restrict himself to attacking and confuting those of his opponent?",
  "23000": "Had they been seen?",
  "23001": "Do you think it could be otherwise when two human beings are drawn to each other by the irresistible force of mutual affection?",
  "23002": "It there nothing behind, that you will not tell me?",
  "23003": "Is it your pleasure to remain in the carriage?",
  "23004": "What people, if you please?",
  "23005": "You did not intend to say, eh?",
  "23006": "Do you reckon these two to be akin?",
  "23007": "If I tell mine, will you tell yours?",
  "23008": "Besides, who could tell?",
  "23009": "How has this ended?",
  "23010": "Where then is the constitution either that gives or restrains power?",
  "23011": "In earnest?",
  "23012": "Is that the crook I'm indebted to for the loss of my plans?",
  "23013": "Was it he, who as everything leads us to believe, saved you from the waves, and that under circumstances in which any one else would not have been able to act?",
  "23014": "Or should I brile a rasher?",
  "23015": "Whose child are you, and what is your name?",
  "23016": "What dignity?",
  "23017": "Carford?",
  "23018": "If I tell you that what have you to say?",
  "23019": "Would you wish to have her sent back to the village, or would you like to take her with you, or what would you prefer?",
  "23020": "Now then will you come or no?",
  "23021": "Who provides our means of subsistence?",
  "23022": "Did you see anything unnatural?",
  "23023": "You still work when you are well?",
  "23024": "But talking of heat, is there nothing I can offer you by way of refreshment?",
  "23025": "Then all is agreed?",
  "23026": "But did they never marry?",
  "23027": "Do you know why your ears are so big?",
  "23028": "Have you telegraph forms?",
  "23029": "What WAS this time travelling?",
  "23030": "Tell me, pray, if they are really clouds, what ails them, that they resemble mortal women?",
  "23031": "Well, what have you to say?",
  "23032": "YOU gifted with the power of pleasing him?",
  "23033": "What do you think of that?",
  "23034": "Why should I want assistance?",
  "23035": "Are you quite sure that you have not made any mistake in all this?",
  "23036": "Is this mine own countree?",
  "23037": "Was it possible, to breathe in again and again, to breathe out, to feel hunger, to eat again, to sleep again, to sleep with a woman again?",
  "23038": "But may I speak to you for a moment?",
  "23039": "You wish perhaps to boast of the cleverness of your investigation, to cry up your talents as detective?",
  "23040": "Would you like to telegraph to the lady assistant?",
  "23041": "As to his private expenditure, you mean?",
  "23042": "Why should a horse want to put itself in the human power?",
  "23043": "Where, indeed, is to be found more patriotism than in the country, greater devotion to the public welfare, more intelligence, in a word?",
  "23044": "Is that far off?",
  "23045": "What could be going on there?",
  "23046": "Cool?",
  "23047": "Moriarty?",
  "23048": "Where has she gone to dwell?",
  "23049": "What more could a man ask?",
  "23050": "To start with?",
  "23051": "Not going home alone, are you?",
  "23052": "But why did you say just now that there were very particular reasons why I should study this case?",
  "23053": "And if he refuses, who will stand then?",
  "23054": "So you have never noticed before how beautiful I am?",
  "23055": "Your majesty will not allow me to justify myself?",
  "23056": "Have I, now?",
  "23057": "At his what?",
  "23058": "You have mistaken my meaning?",
  "23059": "But does it apply to the present case?",
  "23060": "Where were you born?",
  "23061": "How about those occupations in which time is difficult to calculate?",
  "23062": "Shall we not pay ransom and go our ways?",
  "23063": "But the cause of this surprise?",
  "23064": "Will not their presence prevail against the current of his humour?",
  "23065": "Shall we begin by assuring him that he is welcome to any knowledge which he may have, and that we are rejoiced at his having it?",
  "23066": "Will you never change?",
  "23067": "What reason do you assign?",
  "23068": "What is that germ like?",
  "23069": "You will remain here, then?",
  "23070": "He will, I suppose, return there with you, if his sight gets strong again?",
  "23071": "Is not the separation and release of the soul from the body their especial study?",
  "23072": "Did the cow calve?",
  "23073": "What is sin?",
  "23074": "Who comes there?",
  "23075": "Why, is it over for you already?",
  "23076": "What can you do against us?",
  "23077": "How is one to explain this?",
  "23078": "What is the use of tongues when a sigh or a groan will tell all men feel while, perforce, they think in silence?",
  "23079": "A real doll?",
  "23080": "What?",
  "23081": "Why fiction?",
  "23082": "And what are you in trouble about?",
  "23083": "How is it to be expected that he should understand?",
  "23084": "Do you know what o'clock it is?",
  "23085": "Will you, or will you not?",
  "23086": "Why am I here to relate the destruction of the best hope and the purest creature on earth?",
  "23087": "And then so, do you see?",
  "23088": "Can he swim?",
  "23089": "What has happened?",
  "23090": "Why should she thus weep for him in paroxysms of truest grief?",
  "23091": "You know nothing about it?",
  "23092": "For wherefore should I love them less than heretofore?",
  "23093": "Did the others feel as you did?",
  "23094": "But how often has he been heard to restrain the violent and less reserved expressions of those about him?",
  "23095": "What is he in search of?",
  "23096": "How long did you stay?",
  "23097": "What are your products?",
  "23098": "How's that for the bare outline?",
  "23099": "How could he know, even?",
  "23100": "My good fellow?",
  "23101": "How could I be so cruel to you?",
  "23102": "It is my marriage you mean, is it not, dear grandpapa?",
  "23103": "But tell me, and tell me true, in what way did you die?",
  "23104": "How can one think with one's head all fuzzy?",
  "23105": "How can you expect that I shall continue to love you, when I see you maintain, when I hear you swear to me a thing which I know to be false?",
  "23106": "What can it mean, this relentless persecution?",
  "23107": "WHY so pale and wan, fond lover?",
  "23108": "Two in the morning, or two in the afternoon?",
  "23109": "Are you sick then?",
  "23110": "Who knows what may happen to us anywhere?",
  "23111": "Have I not heard you say that he would have had you too a soldier, but for your mother?",
  "23112": "What does a man say to a girl?",
  "23113": "Did she own she liked it?",
  "23114": "What is your own idea, then?",
  "23115": "But how can he explain that smile, that excitement after he had been talking to her?",
  "23116": "Should I, too, look back?",
  "23117": "Have you nothing to confess, somebody will ask me, upon this subject?",
  "23118": "Is this enviable or is it not?",
  "23119": "What was the object of the second man?",
  "23120": "Do you think I can stay to become nothing to you?",
  "23121": "Shall I have a barricado made against my friends, to be barr'd of any pleasure they can bring in to me with their honourable visitation?",
  "23122": "What I want to know is, where I ought to rank myself?",
  "23123": "Will you take a gold piece?",
  "23124": "Was it but the mockery of penitence?",
  "23125": "Are they?",
  "23126": "Saccharum, doctor?",
  "23127": "Of course you love him dearly?",
  "23128": "What was the thickness of this wall?",
  "23129": "What pen can describe it?",
  "23130": "Is controlling it as other property the same thing as destroying it, or driving it away?",
  "23131": "What is that, my love?",
  "23132": "Was there no one with you?",
  "23133": "Can you tell us what to do?",
  "23134": "To whom?",
  "23135": "When a good man sticks his bayonet through another good man, father of a family, or, perhaps, a great artist, what idea is he following out?",
  "23136": "Ah, it was you, sir?",
  "23137": "Shall we have the light?",
  "23138": "And into what a delicious riot of things am I rushing?",
  "23139": "Why did you not come?",
  "23140": "They are friends of yours, then?",
  "23141": "Did the government keep family histories?",
  "23142": "How did you guess?",
  "23143": "But how can the news be brought to you?",
  "23144": "Could they have fallen into the sea?",
  "23145": "The visible heavens and earth, the whole system of the universe, which may be conceived by the mind, is it created or eternal?",
  "23146": "But where is the other?",
  "23147": "What's the matter with me, anyhow?",
  "23148": "Are you set on the death of that spy?",
  "23149": "Does his mother not know this?",
  "23150": "Then you noticed it too?",
  "23151": "I am right, am I not?",
  "23152": "Why did she take it into her head to die at that moment?",
  "23153": "Saw you ever the like?",
  "23154": "And who am I, to nourish such ambition?",
  "23155": "You are surprised at what you see here?",
  "23156": "Do you hear the laughing and his voice?",
  "23157": "Shall I bear false witness?",
  "23158": "Is he not reviving slowly?",
  "23159": "What's afoot now, young un?",
  "23160": "What sort of a place was it, and what would he be like?",
  "23161": "Had any of them made such a hash of life as he?",
  "23162": "Who's the other cup for?",
  "23163": "Is there more?",
  "23164": "What paper was that?",
  "23165": "And when you know, will you tell me?",
  "23166": "How long would it take for a telegram to reach him?",
  "23167": "Do you wish to make good your boasted prowess?",
  "23168": "Is it not, therefore, clear, that in marrying him, you would descend to a rank below you own?",
  "23169": "How should I forget ?",
  "23170": "What boot these wonders?",
  "23171": "And who says so?",
  "23172": "How long have you been engaged?",
  "23173": "What they read in the church?",
  "23174": "If this sailor had escaped the perils of the shipwreck, why should not the captain?",
  "23175": "Oh, how can I live?",
  "23176": "But how did that old man, alone, in opposition to the general opinion, so truly discern the importance of the people's view of the events that in all his activity he was never once untrue to it?",
  "23177": "I suppose you can transform us into beasts as well as birds?",
  "23178": "How is it one never sees you?",
  "23179": "Where've you been?",
  "23180": "Now say if I conceal anything from you?",
  "23181": "What speech was there between you?",
  "23182": "Is not all that happiness when they are the three together, husband, wife and child?",
  "23183": "How is it you are so late?",
  "23184": "You have kept a diary of all these so strange things, is it not so?",
  "23185": "But your companions?",
  "23186": "I trust that there is nothing of consequence which I have overlooked?",
  "23187": "Is it for my own sake?",
  "23188": "Well, what are you going to do?",
  "23189": "And is there nothing on the way?",
  "23190": "Gentlemen, please you change a few crowns for a very excellent blade here?",
  "23191": "What, now, is the significance of this appeal from ANALYSIS to the false judgments of the synthesis?",
  "23192": "Is not that it?",
  "23193": "Forgive you?",
  "23194": "What association?",
  "23195": "But where are these persons, then?",
  "23196": "What doth he seek on the height?",
  "23197": "Where shall we lie in wait?",
  "23198": "And by what gate did they go out?",
  "23199": "From whom can come so many disgraces heaped upon her head, if not from him?",
  "23200": "Who invited you?",
  "23201": "Making love in play, eh?",
  "23202": "How, then, could his father's heart remain void, and closed to its influence?",
  "23203": "Have you heard the story?",
  "23204": "Would you really give us the money?",
  "23205": "But what other internal attributes of such an object can I think than those which my internal sense presents to me?",
  "23206": "Any children?",
  "23207": "How is it distant?",
  "23208": "Which box do you mean?",
  "23209": "How can a system of education flourish that begins by so monstrous a falsehood, which the sense of hearing suffices to contradict?",
  "23210": "Do you know anything about him?",
  "23211": "What are you talking about, then?",
  "23212": "Is it a long drive to the church?",
  "23213": "Diggory?",
  "23214": "How shall I set about it?",
  "23215": "His horses where?",
  "23216": "Have you no father nor mother?",
  "23217": "A present?",
  "23218": "Do you hear me when I tell you that, my darling?",
  "23219": "And when you can do better, you will?",
  "23220": "And does he catch plenty of fish?",
  "23221": "Did you ever stop to think of all the love letters that have been found after death?",
  "23222": "But the rebellion continues, and, now that the election is over, may not all have a common interest to reunite in a common effort to save our common country?",
  "23223": "Why do you say that?",
  "23224": "What could she have to conceal from me whose happiness she knew principally consisted in that of herself and her daughter?",
  "23225": "But if death is the journey to another place, and there, as men say, all the dead abide, what good, O my friends and judges, can be greater than this?",
  "23226": "Do you expect news from him?",
  "23227": "Will you trust me?",
  "23228": "Say, is it thus those honours you requite?",
  "23229": "Where is he who called me?",
  "23230": "May I not come near you?",
  "23231": "What are you doing for it?",
  "23232": "Father, you have trained me from my cradle?",
  "23233": "What do you say, then, to my right?",
  "23234": "Am I so like you?",
  "23235": "Who was there to teach him better, or where was it to be learnt?",
  "23236": "But what is so headstrong as youth?",
  "23237": "Who put that mouse in my desk?",
  "23238": "Are they all to be treated, until they are large enough to be organized into a political community, as wanderers upon the public land, in violation of law?",
  "23239": "So does my grocer stigmatize me when I complain of the quality of his sultanas, and he answers in one breath that they are the best sultanas, and how can I expect the best sultanas at that price?",
  "23240": "What of him?",
  "23241": "Do you do nothing but architectural sculpture?",
  "23242": "Har you a goin' to pay me?",
  "23243": "What nonsense?",
  "23244": "Have you not said that that abduction was entirely political?",
  "23245": "But what is the difference?",
  "23246": "Is that a friar passing?",
  "23247": "Why did you not listen to the counsels of your confessor?",
  "23248": "Is he quite well?",
  "23249": "Did he himself quite know what he meant?",
  "23250": "Do you suppose it does not give me pain to hear you thus spoken of with scorn?",
  "23251": "Are there exceptions to this proposition?",
  "23252": "What are you?",
  "23253": "Are they longing for another rule?",
  "23254": "Why does she wring her lovely hands and beat and tear her breast?",
  "23255": "Oh, why not?",
  "23256": "What was going on in her poor little head?",
  "23257": "And at what height?",
  "23258": "I hope it was not on account of bad news?",
  "23259": "Your mother, no doubt, or some female relative of advanced years, resides here also?",
  "23260": "But what do you want money for?",
  "23261": "Shall I show her in, madam?",
  "23262": "You grant me the text?",
  "23263": "If we had no war out of it when thus placed, wherein is the ground of belief that we shall have war out of it if we return to that policy?",
  "23264": "Why do you ask me such a question?",
  "23265": "Who was speaking?",
  "23266": "And, if you will let me for a moment speak of the very highest forms of literature, do we not regard them as highest simply because the more we know the truer they seem, and the more competent we are to appreciate beauty the more beautiful they are?",
  "23267": "What defect?",
  "23268": "You're sure about the money?",
  "23269": "But why did you think about it, bishop?",
  "23270": "Then why, my friend, do you put on such a dismal countenance?",
  "23271": "What do you wish me not to have?",
  "23272": "Shall we be towed by him to the infernal world?",
  "23273": "Did I promise to wait for you at some barn?",

  "23294": "And you have fought often?",
  "23295": "Would not the mere circumstance of freight occasion a considerable deduction?",
  "23296": "Does your arm hurt you?",
  "23297": "And your police, they would interfere, would they not?",
  "23298": "But may I wait and reflect a little while?",
  "23299": "And should an immortal being seriously think of this little space rather than of the whole?",

  "23312": "Do you know that your letter frightens me?",
  "23313": "Might I speak a word to you, my lady?",
  "23314": "And what do you do then?",
  "23315": "But in the midst of their perplexity, what sound was that which startled them?",
  "23316": "Would not this tinker be a good recruit?",
  "23317": "Saving money?",
  "23318": "What would any be but odd men and they living lonesome in the world?",
  "23319": "Can such opponents stand when we assail?",
  "23320": "When does she try to avoid society, or appear restless and dissatisfied in it?",
  "23321": "What do they say?",
  "23322": "Can I hope?",
  "23323": "Why do not you oftener make use of copper?",
  "23324": "She asked her, at different times, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother's maiden name?",
  "23325": "It's all arranged about bringing off the swag, is it?",
  "23326": "Will you warrant him sound, wind and limb?",
  "23327": "And now, doctor, how about money, eh?",
  "23328": "You've had him once, and what has he done for you?",
  "23329": "Is I heah, or whah IS I?",
  "23330": "Ellen, what do you think?",
  "23331": "Why any fear of detection?",
  "23332": "You've noticed that, too?",
  "23333": "What shall we see?",
  "23334": "Why not make one's own fashions?",
  "23335": "And why are they here at this time?",
  "23336": "Do you see the likeness?",
  "23337": "But if we have now ceased to advance why do we yet leave that sail loose, which at the first shock of the tempest may capsize us in a moment?",
  "23338": "Who's to put it out?",
  "23339": "Are we no longer on speaking terms?",
  "23340": "And what good thing is there beyond that we may gain by length of days?",
  "23341": "Has she a recognized knight, then?",
  "23342": "From whom does he borrow?",
  "23343": "Which does she mean?",
  "23344": "And does that not go a long way?",
  "23345": "Why not accept the whole of history?",
  "23346": "Would you believe that?",
  "23347": "And if the dead were conscious would they be pleased?",
  "23348": "But who knows what the sly man may not pick up?",
  "23349": "Who can they be?",
  "23350": "If I meet you by chance, there is no concealment in that?",

  "23353": "Did you ask how much?",
  "23354": "What do you mean by more time?",
  "23355": "Am I to understand that this man has professed himself to be altogether indifferent to the bishop's prohibition?",
  "23356": "How much do you owe me?",
  "23357": "Are you ill?",
  "23358": "What facts?",
  "23359": "Who gave me such a father as that?",
  "23360": "What is it not?",
  "23361": "You, who are never afraid of living men, what do you fear from the dead?",
  "23362": "Boy, would you have him live to dishonor these gray hairs?",
  "23363": "But do you?",
  "23364": "But who had power like him?",
  "23365": "Did I press it in the least?",
  "23366": "Even for what I have just said to you?",
  "23367": "Will not you rise up and turn upon those that strike you?",
  "23368": "What's the good of talking to you?",
  "23369": "Knew what?",
  "23370": "What do you think of my theory?",
  "23371": "And what had you to report?",
  "23372": "I suppose I may come over and see you if I'm good?",
  "23373": "But how will you make yourself proof against calumny?",
  "23374": "Ada is well?",
  "23375": "Is it only chance?",
  "23376": "When shall we be led to the field of battle?",
  "23377": "But tell me, are you printing this book at your own risk, or have you sold the copyright to some bookseller?",
  "23378": "And are you sure that it did not?",
  "23379": "This what you want?",
  "23380": "What cheer?",
  "23381": "Did you find the journey tiring?",
  "23382": "Ah, I also wanted to ask you where our position is exactly?",
  "23383": "What is property?",
  "23384": "Sleeping well still?",
  "23385": "What of your husband, the forester?",
  "23386": "After you went to bed?",
  "23387": "What can be more natural?",
  "23388": "We three?",
  "23389": "What are you studying?",
  "23390": "Why not six square acres, while you're about it?",
  "23391": "Then I am to conclude that you decline to do anything?",
  "23392": "Who shall dare to say that the sun is false?",
  "23393": "What do you say?",
  "23394": "How, how?",
  "23395": "Do you think he meant anything, dear?",
  "23396": "And whom do you accuse?",
  "23397": "And what does he say?",
  "23398": "What other gratification?",
  "23399": "In the first place, is it positively true that the king has given it to him?",
  "23400": "Have you been to the general?",
  "23401": "How does the same principle, rigorously followed to its conclusions, lead to effects diametrically opposite?",
  "23402": "Do you want me to go away?",
  "23403": "Which door?",
  "23404": "What would be the use of carrying so much more weight?",
  "23405": "You remember what happened, eh?",
  "23406": "May not a body see her?",
  "23407": "Which are they?",
  "23408": "But you absolve me from all other sins, why not from that?",
  "23409": "Well, now, what do you say to a cart?",
  "23410": "Why so soft, so submissive and yielding?",
  "23411": "Your WHAT?",
  "23412": "Or to drown kitlings?",
  "23413": "How are we going to pay it?",
  "23414": "Nine folks out of ten would own 'twas going too far to dance then, I suppose?",
  "23415": "Madam, do you cut little children's things?",
  "23416": "Why did he let me come here?",
  "23417": "And who are your companions?",
  "23418": "In the presence of witnesses?",
  "23419": "Should she indeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and denounce the murderer?",
  "23420": "Was she not here, put absolutely in his path?",
  "23421": "Suppose one of the company should call for a glass of wine, how will you behave?",
  "23422": "Do you observe it?",
  "23423": "How should we accomplish this?",
  "23424": "In gastronomy?",
  "23425": "Ah, his friend is with him?",
  "23426": "What, what?",
  "23427": "Had I unwittingly provoked this fit of anger?",
  "23428": "And these roses, the fairest that ever were seen?",
  "23429": "Why should I marry him?",
  "23430": "Wait upon them?",
  "23431": "And why were you so affected at that story, or rather fable, which the count related?",
  "23432": "But suppose they fight?",
  "23433": "The first week, did you say?",
  "23434": "What about women?",
  "23435": "Then shall we fight courageously with them?",
  "23436": "Thereby it asked, in less general terms, what was the cause of the social evil, and what was its remedy?",
  "23437": "Who was it guessed right this time?",
  "23438": "Does the virtue consist in the metaphor, or in the man?",
  "23439": "Think you that a thern would demean himself by labour?",
  "23440": "Can you point it out to me?",
  "23441": "Does my country need a victim?",
  "23442": "What do you call this?",
  "23443": "But is he really a prince?",
  "23444": "Shall we have it here instead of in my house?",
  "23445": "What on earth would we want them for?",
  "23446": "How was that?",
  "23447": "And he the speaker?",
  "23448": "Why, too, had he pretended they were not his when I had remarked about them at first?",
  "23449": "How could you be so simple?",
  "23450": "Might he not as well come as send?",
  "23451": "What friends?",
  "23452": "Can no accident, no unforeseen circumstance, snatch it from us?",
  "23453": "Would they keep me long enough to spend seven shillings?",
  "23454": "Do you think it will work?",
  "23455": "What mean you, sirrah?",
  "23456": "Is she fair now as she lies?",
  "23457": "Have you a winged horse, then?",
  "23458": "Where is the bundle we sent down before us?",
  "23459": "Why should he be dragged from a career he liked in a place he loved, into a career he detested, in a place and climate he shunned?",
  "23460": "He eats, then?",
  "23461": "The hatchway?",
  "23462": "What does he care?",
  "23463": "Where does that door lead to?",
  "23464": "A widow, I think?",
  "23465": "And did he die that night?",
  "23466": "Is not all weeping complaining?",
  "23467": "Have you come out of the water?",
  "23468": "But what were the metes and bounds of this province which had been so often bought and sold?",
  "23469": "Again, would you choose an occasion when you are known to be in the house, when a servant has let you in?",
  "23470": "Heavens, what is that?",
  "23471": "He is going to return to it immediately, is he not?",
  "23472": "And yet, now that I can reflect quietly, now that my spirit has grown calm again, now that months have slipped by since this strange and supernatural meeting, what am I to think?",

  "23474": "Is the machine yours?",
  "23475": "You demanded a favor?",
  "23476": "Where, then, did the hospital defaulters get their drink?",
  "23477": "But what has become of my father there, then, all these two years?",
  "23478": "At the castle?",
  "23479": "Is there no passage inside the door, then?",
  "23480": "Yet again, who shall judge me?",
  "23481": "And shall we revisit together a hapless spot, that proved so fatal to many of our former brave companions?",
  "23482": "Why do you want to know the name of my clerk?",
  "23483": "Is it possible?",
  "23484": "To what, then, are we indebted for our safety?",

  "23495": "Well, and do not all these qualities, which we have been enumerating, go together, and are they not, in a manner, necessary to a soul, which is to have a full and perfect participation of being?",
  "23496": "Have you been here ever since?",
  "23497": "What would you do with him, now?",
  "23498": "Can he, then, be trusted with the government of others?",
  "23499": "Do they not owe their lives to you?",
  "23500": "Well, sir, what do you require of me, and what document is it that you wish to be drawn up?",
  "23501": "Is the sleeper the leafless forest or the bare earth of winter?",

  "23538": "You would like to return to your people?",
  "23539": "Suppose I should tell you wrong?",
  "23540": "What mystery was here?",
  "23541": "Slight, do you say?",
  "23542": "Are we to regard him as a mere lawless egoist, or as something more?",
  "23543": "Do you know yourself what you looked like?",
  "23544": "I asked myself had these latter things indeed happened?",
  "23545": "You were not awake an hour ago?",

  "23575": "Not seldom that long wandering unfits us for further travel, and of what use is our experience to us then?",
  "23576": "You think it will go to a jury, then?",
  "23577": "And what is in the ALFORJAS?",
  "23578": "Can this be?",
  "23579": "Shall I go alone?",

  "24479": "I do not seek to know where these dreadful people live, but where will you be walking or passing at any settled period from this time?",
  "24480": "I take it for granted that she is not particularly not dangerously affected, eh?",
  "24481": "On all the counts?",
  "24482": "But what if neither of these two ways will work upon you, of which doleful truth some of our playwrights stand so many living monuments?",
  "24483": "Does he now understand?",
  "24484": "What are the facts upon which this bold assertion is based?",
  "24485": "Is not now sitting opposite to you?",
  "24486": "The same as yesterday?",
  "24487": "Why has this happened?",
  "24488": "Who is there?",
  "24489": "Are these worth a great deal of money, mamma?",
  "24490": "Do you tell me his name?",
  "24491": "How long has it been going on?",
  "24492": "Would that be an extraordinary rate of speed?",
  "24493": "What's the salary?",
  "24494": "And what business has she here abroad and alone?",
  "24495": "And that is nothing?",
  "24496": "Then you suffer a great deal?",
  "24497": "Could you do it now?",
  "24498": "Such is the clearness of still water, and how much greater is that of the human spirit?",
  "24499": "Who was it she was in love with?",
  "24500": "And how did you return?",
  "24501": "For me?",
  "24502": "And am I despised?",
  "24503": "How, I pray?",
  "24504": "Is that the end of the story?",
  "24505": "What are you thinking of, little woman?",
  "24506": "What would I not have given to be the child of her mother?",
  "24507": "But will you help me?",
  "24508": "What can I write?",
  "24509": "Is this ideal to survive and prevail in our civilization or not?",
  "24510": "Have you the certificate?",
  "24511": "Why have you come here?",
  "24512": "Why thus do I loiter and not knock at the door?",
  "24513": "Will you assure me it shall not be signed?",
  "24514": "How much does he give you for bringing him that envelope?",
  "24515": "How was the rest of the papers?",
  "24516": "Imagination?",
  "24517": "So much the better?",
  "24518": "How is it that I can, then?",
  "24519": "And who is to find that out, if not he who holds the keys of power?",
  "24520": "Will you listen to the braggart?",
  "24521": "Therefore, as the family say, why not let well enough alone?",
  "24522": "You remember coming up here?",
  "24523": "Do you think I could eat it?",
  "24524": "Did ever any man believe in horsemanship, and not in horses?",
  "24525": "But when shall she die?",
  "24526": "Do you feel good?",
  "24527": "Is this your young attendant?",
  "24528": "Of all the orators, who, during the whole course of their lives, have done nothing else, which can you prefer to him?",
  "24529": "Where does HE live?",
  "24530": "Who could be coming at such an hour?",
  "24531": "Are we quite safe in this cavern?",
  "24532": "Why unfortunately?",
  "24533": "Does the spirit which has produced such results need to be stimulated or checked?",
  "24534": "Do you know the place where he was buried?",
  "24535": "For maircy's sake, what object's this?",
  "24536": "And now I am to choose?",
  "24537": "What should I get for all this?",
  "24538": "Boy of the neighborhood?",
  "24539": "Where were the other six?",
  "24540": "And then you bring news, do you not?",
  "24541": "And is it possible that this frightful combination of crimes has been invented by a woman?",
  "24542": "What plans have you made?",
  "24543": "And who was the person long ago?",
  "24544": "And after what fashion?",
  "24545": "What is there to hinder you?",
  "24546": "In economic language what are luxuries?",
  "24547": "The true question to be decided then is, whether the smallness of the number, as a temporary regulation, be dangerous to the public liberty?",
  "24548": "What did it profit a man to gain the whole world if he lost his soul?",
  "24549": "Mean and shabby, eh?",
  "24550": "Is it not so?",
  "24551": "How many arts do you understand?",
  "24552": "Had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me?",
  "24553": "Does sedition blaze so wildly in my land, that we have no longer the power to subdue it?",
  "24554": "You must know SOMETHING to have advertised as you did?",
  "24555": "Do you not know him?",
  "24556": "Does anyone contest your rights?",
  "24557": "Then you yourself are one of these marked beings?",
  "24558": "But what was the fate of the guards who thus possessed his secret?",
  "24559": "Am I not he that has been overthrown?",
  "24560": "Do you remember the rest?",
  "24561": "Why do you wish to return to companions you paint in such terrible colors?",
  "24562": "Why have they all been bullying me these three days about you, prince?",
  "24563": "What is the matter with you?",
  "24564": "What were you thinking?",
  "24565": "What can have put the shivers on him?",
  "24566": "Eh, boy?",
  "24567": "Does she exercise any authority over you in that way?",
  "24568": "Ought it?",
  "24569": "Why am I so old?",
  "24570": "Would she forgive him?",
  "24571": "Or with what peculiar force does he suppose himself invigorated, that difficulties hitherto invincible should give way before him?",
  "24572": "What do you think has happened this morning?",
  "24573": "No, why be sorry?",
  "24574": "Why this hideous costume, when he had so much money in his purse?",
  "24575": "Is any sick?",
  "24576": "Is that your remedy for everything?",
  "24577": "Who stole the rabbit?",
  "24578": "What, then, are the distinctive characters of the republican form?",
  "24579": "I mean if we wished?",
  "24580": "What are you convinced of?",
  "24581": "What had come of the pride of his spirit which had always made him conceive himself as a being apart in every order?",
  "24582": "Providence?",
  "24583": "Is feminine beauty a trifle to be so slightly regarded by a wise man?",
  "24584": "Of what original word is the translation?",
  "24585": "You are there, sir?",
  "24586": "Then you are a sea fisherman?",
  "24587": "Will you sell me one of your lobsters?",
  "24588": "What on earth do you do there?",
  "24589": "Who would spare himself now?",
  "24590": "Is that the boat, where I see a light yonder?",
  "24591": "Why did you not come down to breakfast?",
  "24592": "What is it that you've learned, what you're able to do?",
  "24593": "What sold?",
  "24594": "You are expecting a letter, then?",
  "24595": "So you have neither father nor mother?",
  "24596": "You mean it's for him you most suffer?",
  "24597": "How are we to get rid of him?",
  "24598": "Let us go, you mean?",
  "24599": "If they ask it what have I to say?",
  "24600": "Ought he not to be singed?",
  "24601": "Will you let me look at it?",
  "24602": "You have not noticed anything?",
  "24603": "To what single individual has it ever proved an injury?",
  "24604": "Had he not that note this moment in his pocket?",
  "24605": "Do you observe the plunges that this poor gallant is put to, signior, to purchase the fashion?",
  "24606": "And this is the sum of what you could collect last night?",
  "24607": "How does she bear her fate?",
  "24608": "You want so to go out again?",
  "24609": "Would you like me to come with you?",
  "24610": "Who knows the metes and bounds of it?",
  "24611": "What factor do you mean?",
  "24612": "Who wants to quarrel with you?",
  "24613": "You see to what a string of absurdities that will lead?",
  "24614": "When are you off?",
  "24615": "Ought she to?",
  "24616": "And of what account was anybody's past, in the huge kaleidoscope where all the social atoms spun around on the same plane?",
  "24617": "You will take her away?",
  "24618": "Would he marry her?",
  "24619": "What think of 'em?",
  "24620": "What have you done with yours, seeing that it has not made you a miser or a prodigal?",
  "24621": "Are you going to imprison me over night?",
  "24622": "Do you think he expects to make a success of it?",
  "24623": "How can I help it, if he drinks?",
  "24624": "And after dinner?",
  "24625": "There is not a room in this cottage that will hold ten couple, and where can the supper be?",
  "24626": "Why was I always suffering, always browbeaten, always accused, for ever condemned?",
  "24627": "Where shall we lodge this new guest in our great capital?",
  "24628": "Pepys?",
  "24629": "Only thirteen minutes?",
  "24630": "What have you done with your hat?",
  "24631": "Your knowledge of women goes as far as that, does it?",
  "24632": "How many surgeons have you?",
  "24633": "Matthew, are you sick?",
  "24634": "Can no power stop this awful revolving thing?",
  "24635": "When was this?",
  "24636": "Afterward?",
  "24637": "Do you care so much for me?",
  "24638": "And how could she have done any other than to pledge herself, invoked to it as she had been?",
  "24639": "What underlay it?",
  "24640": "Which time?",
  "24641": "How old?",
  "24642": "Now, what is it they want to know?",
  "24643": "Do you wish me to speak the truth?",
  "24644": "What am I to do with them afterwards?",
  "24645": "And what else can I do with myself here?",
  "24646": "And you yourself?",
  "24647": "But what is the difference between a council and a board?",
  "24648": "Where is the manling?",
  "24649": "Why was there nothing to say?",
  "24650": "What's the use of paying two guineas for a dinner with fellows you see every day of your life?",
  "24651": "Why when they leave me do my pennants of joy sink flat and lank?",
  "24652": "Where was the night constable?",
  "24653": "Is there any chance of his being made to speak?",
  "24654": "Would his father meet him at the station?",
  "24655": "But what do you mean by strange?",
  "24656": "Why, what are you thinking about?",
  "24657": "Why should we fear the horrors of famine, when death was swooping down upon us in a multitude of other forms?",
  "24658": "Where's my sword?",
  "24659": "How do you do sir?",
  "24660": "Are there not others for that discipline?",
  "24661": "What is your trouble?",
  "24662": "How do you live then?",
  "24663": "Why should I live now that I have known a perfect love?",
  "24664": "Whose is it?",
  "24665": "And his age?",
  "24666": "To this house?",
  "24667": "Why, pray, do you talk nonsense, as if you had fallen from an ass?",
  "24668": "But why do you take such an interest in me?",
  "24669": "Why has he constantly called them a series of measures?",
  "24670": "What causes?",
  "24671": "What will be the result of your conduct?",
  "24672": "On account of the great geographical discoveries, the important scientific results?",
  "24673": "Is not that always so?",
  "24674": "Can you take that in?",
  "24675": "Did I understand you?",
  "24676": "Well, is it over?",
  "24677": "And what would he have done had he overtaken us?",
  "24678": "And now, what have you got to say next?",
  "24679": "Do you know that for a fact?",
  "24680": "What need you go, sir, if I tell you?",
  "24681": "Or that he who errs in arithmetic or grammar is an arithmetician or grammarian at the me when he is making the mistake, in respect of the mistake?",
  "24682": "What was the use of thinking about behavior after this crying?",
  "24683": "Did it happen here, ever?",
  "24684": "Or rather, is not the nearest approach to the knowledge of their several natures made by him who so orders his intellectual vision as to have the most exact conception of the essence of each thing which he considers?",
  "24685": "Can the dead come to life?",
  "24686": "But cannot you have pity on me?",
  "24687": "Who will give me seven cents more?",
  "24688": "Is this true?",
  "24689": "In what way different?",
  "24690": "What I mean is, what about the next step?",
  "24691": "Do you remember it so well?",
  "24692": "Would you ring the bell, please?",
  "24693": "You have achieved it?",
  "24694": "Oh, have you?",
  "24695": "And do not the two styles, or the mixture of the two, comprehend all poetry, and every form of expression in words?",
  "24696": "What are you going to do, my lord?",
  "24697": "Are we to do nothing, then?",
  "24698": "Have done, shipmate, will ye?",
  "24699": "Since then no part of our earth is left unoccupied, why is it to be supposed that the immensity of space is a naked void, lying in eternal waste?",
  "24700": "The whole truth?",
  "24701": "What more desirable or more essential than this quality in the governors of nations?",
  "24702": "What is your name, dear?",
  "24703": "Governor, why stand you all so pitiless?",
  "24704": "Suppose we say a little something down, and a fuller discussion of the matter later?",
  "24705": "What call you the lord of the castle, sweet face?",
  "24706": "Is the exchange an equitable one?",
  "24707": "What do they care for but money?",
  "24708": "What is it you stare at?",
  "24709": "But you have promised not to go until she comes?",
  "24710": "But what is a cable's length?",
  "24711": "And we'll be in a friendly country?",
  "24712": "What in the world does that mean?",
  "24713": "D'you mean to say they're worth nothing at all?",
  "24714": "What is the use of counting on any success of mine?",
  "24715": "But who were the victors?",
  "24716": "When are you coming out?",
  "24717": "Can you be with us?",
  "24718": "So he is a very good father, is he?",
  "24719": "What do you recognize?",
  "24720": "Where did they draw the treacle from?",
  "24721": "Did not one grain of pity enter your heart as she turned away?",
  "24722": "You're not going with her?",
  "24723": "Is any parallel attempted to be drawn in this company between matrimony and hanging?",
  "24724": "What appointment?",
  "24725": "Who's brought it?",
  "24726": "Who were you then?",
  "24727": "What DID you do, you naughty, bad thing?",
  "24728": "What do you think of those fellows yonder?",
  "24729": "I suppose you have some cause of quarrel?",
  "24730": "Will she permit it?",
  "24731": "Shall I give you a lift?",
  "24732": "What's that he's got in his paddle?",
  "24733": "But what is this last piece of luck that has befallen you?",
  "24734": "And the wise is good?",
  "24735": "Now what have you to say?",
  "24736": "Who can doubt that the refusal to fight a duel through fear has caused many men an agony of shame?",
  "24737": "Have I gone through all this to fail at the last?",
  "24738": "What, with that face?",
  "24739": "And did he frighten my aunt again?",
  "24740": "What his teachings?",
  "24741": "Do you think I'm putting you into an impossible position?",
  "24742": "Can you hear the sound upon the terrace, through the music, and the beat, and everything?",
  "24743": "Are you a perfect fool?",
  "24744": "Will you let me go with you?",
  "24745": "How much time have I lost by illness?",
  "24746": "Is it enough merely to love if one cannot put all the poetry and all the music of heaven and earth into love?",
  "24747": "The next thing is for us to go and wish 'em joy, I suppose?",
  "24748": "How much have you done?",
  "24749": "Perhaps you are offended, gentlemen, that I should receive such guests in your presence?",
  "24750": "I wonder if the beasts will attack us?",
  "24751": "He was not suffering any, why should he relax his severity?",
  "24752": "Tom, have you said to any one that we made a visit to those people, and that we saw those three together?",
  "24753": "And what had I better do about it, sir?",
  "24754": "Polly whom?",
  "24755": "And what we cannot do on a raft could have been done in the ship's boat?",
  "24756": "Does he still continue his rude assaults on those beautiful long silken tresses?",
  "24757": "Did it miss fire?",
  "24758": "What, in heaven's name, was it?",
  "24759": "What were you about saying, sir?",
  "24760": "But was it possible for him to be brave when he was by himself, face to face with his soul, or would he then surrender to despair?",
  "24761": "Why long for a life which could be for him now only an isolated, desolate, and gloomy one?",
  "24762": "Could we not bail her out?",
  "24763": "How shall we prevent a conflict between charity and judgment?",
  "24764": "What have I all along maintained?",
  "24765": "Disko, what did you pick me up for?",
  "24766": "How will you take it, ungrateful brute?",
  "24767": "Why, then, suppose now an inertia which definitions contradict, now an external potentiality which nothing proves?",
  "24768": "Well, but what ought to be the criterion?",
  "24769": "Then, darling papa?",
  "24770": "Or rather was it a boat from the frigate, that was hailing us in the darkness?",
  "24771": "Is this the language of a rational man?",
  "24772": "Well, and how did the ring come into your possession?",
  "24773": "What should I have done as soon as I was hard and fast here?",
  "24774": "Why had not you as good do it?",
  "24775": "Am I going, or not, to my ruin?",
  "24776": "And who is ever silly enough to complain of it?",
  "24777": "But what sort of a way is that for bones to lie?",
  "24778": "Is it not evident, then, I ask you, that there will some day appear velocities far greater than these, of which light or electricity will probably be the mechanical agent?",
  "24779": "What CAN all that green stuff be?",
  "24780": "Do you recognize your quondam pupil, professor?",
  "24781": "I require to be let alone?",
  "24782": "Can he even see the feature?",
  "24783": "Well, why have I worried him, for five years, and never let him go free?",
  "24784": "But meantime, how am I to get on with my washing?",
  "24785": "Are there then chains for two which are forged on high?",
  "24786": "How could you have gone away and left me?",
  "24787": "How many kingdoms are there at present in the world, and how many more do we find in history, whose governors have no better foundation for their authority than that of present possession?",
  "24788": "Is any better than experience and wisdom and reason?",
  "24789": "But can that which is neither become both?",
  "24790": "But he really is disinterested, and above small jealousy and spite, I have heard?",
  "24791": "And he rests now, near his companions, in the coral cemetery?",
  "24792": "What are we to do, now?",
  "24793": "And now, where is he gone?",
  "24794": "Do you not need to mitigate the struggle for existence more sanguine than the war of weapons?",
  "24795": "When will he come back?",
  "24796": "And why should I not dare?",
  "24797": "And is he in love perchance?",
  "24798": "Surely, this was not the only cause of estrangement?",
  "24799": "Where had he heard the name before?",
  "24800": "Where's my mother?",
  "24801": "Were you looking for us?",
  "24802": "But tell me, and tell me true, what is the meaning of all this feasting, and who are these people?",
  "24803": "Has it begun?",
  "24804": "Where are you taking me?",
  "24805": "What's all this?",
  "24806": "Shall you be present in the reception room?",
  "24807": "What was the matter?",
  "24808": "What magazine, or treasury of bliss?",
  "24809": "What do I think?",
  "24810": "Ah, why DID he?",
  "24811": "How could I ask you to gif up so much for a poor old fellow, who has no fortune but a little learning?",
  "24812": "Is it quite certain?",
  "24813": "Clayton?",
  "24814": "Why do you not think so?",
  "24815": "And you will permit me to accompany you?",
  "24816": "And you can refuse, you mean, eh?",
  "24817": "What, then, was there left to do?",
  "24818": "What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed?",
  "24819": "Are you so sure?",
  "24820": "Is that too simple a source of pleasure for some to prize?",
  "24821": "Then you knew her before?",
  "24822": "Have you not asked papa for money?",
  "24823": "Is there anything whimsical about me?",
  "24824": "Is this ingratitude, however?",
  "24825": "For nothing?",
  "24826": "The winch, you say?",
  "24827": "Was ever a man in such a fearful fool's position?",
  "24828": "But this kind man who has done so much will, I am sure, take you right on to my house?",
  "24829": "But if no one among us is capable of governing himself, then who among us has the capacity to govern someone else?",
  "24830": "Was personal happiness the aim and object of their ambition?",
  "24831": "Have you ever seen a wire jacket?",
  "24832": "Cranmer awaits us in the private chapel?",
  "24833": "And how about today's telegram?",
  "24834": "Where had that daring singer got to?",
  "24835": "Was it he who threw us that bottle, when the vessel made her first cruise?",
  "24836": "Brilliant?",
  "24837": "Now, what is competition?",
  "24838": "Do you know that you are speaking to me quite as a friend?",
  "24839": "What do you do then?",
  "24840": "Do you think we live as cheaply as we might?",
  "24841": "Surely there are classified lists?",
  "24842": "Why ride into the middle of the battalion?",
  "24843": "May I ask if you can confirm these statements?",
  "24844": "Is not this an infallible and sovereign antidote?",
  "24845": "Well, what's this now?",
  "24846": "Now, what have we a right to possess?",
  "24847": "A cigarette?",
  "24848": "But what did he do, my dear?",
  "24849": "What act?",
  "24850": "What in thunder is it?",
  "24851": "And the man?",
  "24852": "How am I to understand you, mon pere?",
  "24853": "Why dilate upon what everybody knows?",
  "24854": "Might this be for you, sir?",
  "24855": "How can you learn lessons in here?",
  "24856": "Who be these?",
  "24857": "Do you love my son?",
  "24858": "What follows that angel?",
  "24859": "Will it strengthen our families and support our children?",
  "24860": "Why where should I leave them but where I found them?",
  "24861": "Shall he now be arrested in his desolating career?",
  "24862": "Do you know what that means?",
  "24863": "But why should I make a long story of it?",
  "24864": "Are you not jealous at all?",
  "24865": "And do you believe it to be so?",
  "24866": "Do you take milk in yours?",
  "24867": "What fiend is this?",
  "24868": "Where are they?",
  "24869": "Would any one believe it?",
  "24870": "What if I've accepted too passively the funny form of our life?",
  "24871": "What, indeed, can tend to deprave the character more than outward submission and inward contempt?",
  "24872": "If they bite and kick?",
  "24873": "Is there that about me that should affright a man?",
  "24874": "For how can any experience be adequate with an idea?",
  "24875": "What is this I hear about you?",
  "24876": "How old are you, dear?",
  "24877": "I wonder if they made that fearful sound I heard just before you came?",
  "24878": "What made them kick you out?",
  "24879": "Am I allowed to repeat it?",
  "24880": "I think that this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with me for six o'clock?",
  "24881": "Have you any dice in your pocket?",
  "24882": "What on earth put such a notion into your head?",
  "24883": "None belonging to your father?",
  "24884": "What had he to say?",
  "24885": "Owing to him?",
  "24886": "To me, sir?",
  "24887": "What do you suppose she wants to talk about tomorrow?",
  "24888": "Would he say a lie?",
  "24889": "How much money had these men fraudulently obtained?",
  "24890": "How many have you loved?",
  "24891": "Then why, when you were able to run away, did you go back to him?",
  "24892": "You are alone?",
  "24893": "What are your favourite flowers?",
  "24894": "By your misfortune?",
  "24895": "Now are you satisfied?",
  "24896": "Who is your lady friend with the big grey envelope and the fat monogram outside?",
  "24897": "How many millions upon millions of centuries would pass before that bird had carried away even a square foot of that mountain, how many eons upon eons of ages before it had carried away all?",
  "24898": "Have you got them?",
  "24899": "Did you get lost?",
  "24900": "I wonder how he felt when he heard it?",
  "24901": "What need for weapon?",
  "24902": "Weevle?",
  "24903": "Are we falling?",
  "24904": "And by character?",
  "24905": "And would not a really good education furnish the best safeguard?",
  "24906": "What manner of man are you?",
  "24907": "And that one?",
  "24908": "Has he ever taken from the rich that he did not give again to the poor?",
  "24909": "Has your mother relented at last?",
  "24910": "What do you want to do?",
  "24911": "Is this all your spinning, grandmother?",
  "24912": "What sort of ship?",
  "24913": "And do they not share?",
  "24914": "Shall I meet strange, heavenly things?",
  "24915": "What is that thing?",
  "24916": "But who else?",
  "24917": "Why, how?",
  "24918": "Do you hear, my children?",
  "24919": "Can you deny that all that was craft and deceit and fraud and greed?",
  "24920": "How shall we set about it?",
  "24921": "Not too difficult?",
  "24922": "Were his father's religious devotion, his teachers warnings, his own knowledge, his own search able to keep him safe?",
  "24923": "Should they be embarked?",
  "24924": "Is my experience but of yesterday?",
  "24925": "Can I trust in you?",
  "24926": "Are you in earnest?",
  "24927": "Where are you to go?",
  "24928": "Do you want to earn half a crown?",
  "24929": "Wilcox?",
  "24930": "What do I mean?",
  "24931": "But will no one remain in the house, my lord?",
  "24932": "How, then, with these variations and with revenues so uncertain, can we establish even distribution and uniform wages for laborers?",
  "24933": "Of the hearses?",
  "24934": "But will you not drink with me, sir?",
  "24935": "What avail is it?",
  "24936": "Oh, I must, hey?",
  "24937": "What more natural than to imagine that the violets and the hyacinths, the roses and the anemones, sprang from their dust, were empurpled or incarnadined by their blood, and contained some portion of their spirit?",
  "24938": "Or are they both in this their own reward?",
  "24939": "What do we do?",
  "24940": "How will you live?",
  "24941": "Will you remember that, if you please?",
  "24942": "Does he read ee very long zermons, my dear?",
  "24943": "What is a passport?",
  "24944": "How long do you remain in town?",
  "24945": "Where shall I see the head of him which contrived to murder his father, which I will tear to pieces with my own hands?",
  "24946": "Why this absence of mind, and sweet irresolution?",
  "24947": "We better than you?",
  "24948": "Did this mad wife of his carry it off with her?",
  "24949": "Had the man seen through him?",
  "24950": "But will you promise to have me took there, sir, and laid along with him?",
  "24951": "But if I do not marry?",
  "24952": "Why did he interfere with me, and fill your mind with such falsehood?",
  "24953": "But when one has no experience, how can one tell what is sickness and what is health?",
  "24954": "How can you tell who is poor?",
  "24955": "Is it so precious?",
  "24956": "Why am I to be disturbed?",
  "24957": "Will you take my advice?",
  "24958": "Something important?",
  "24959": "Perhaps you think I am mad, eh?",
  "24960": "Shall you have the courage?",
  "24961": "Will you forget him?",
  "24962": "Wait for you?",
  "24963": "Now, what fault can you point out in him?",
  "24964": "CUI BONO?",
  "24965": "Where had the dragon gone in such a short space of time?",
  "24966": "You've got a friend here?",
  "24967": "What has he made you?",
  "24968": "You keep the registers of entries and departures?",
  "24969": "To what tribe do they belong?",
  "24970": "And then?",
  "24971": "What does your wife want?",
  "24972": "It was his life or mine, but far more than that, it was his life or hers, for how could I leave her in the power of this madman?",
  "24973": "How did I get hold of that?",
  "24974": "Whatever is the matter?",
  "24975": "And it is true that you did not set it on fire?",
  "24976": "Has anything unpleasant happened since I saw you?",
  "24977": "Is it believed that axioms in metaphysics, declarations of right, harangues from the tribune, will put a stop to the disbanding of an army?",
  "24978": "What does not a man undergo for the sake of a cure?",
  "24979": "You a member here?",
  "24980": "What is your own experience of him?",
  "24981": "Me, young ladies?",
  "24982": "What are these corruptions?",
  "24983": "Why must he look farther than their platform when he claims himself to stand by his platform?",
  "24984": "Now, surely, if he takes so warmly to people who are not related to him at all, may he not take as warmly to his own kin?",
  "24985": "Not since the humour of gentility was upon you, did you?",
  "24986": "Governor come round?",
  "24987": "That boy's tutor?",
  "24988": "What is a soul?",
  "24989": "And with our wives?",
  "24990": "Who would think of plotting with a poor little weak creature like me?",
  "24991": "What is his exact kin to us, mother?",
  "24992": "Is this a new brand of humour?",
  "24993": "Yes, what were we talking about?",
  "24994": "Do I know them?",
  "24995": "And what business have you here?",
  "24996": "You know who bricks and mortar is, I suppose, sir?",
  "24997": "Oh, what's the use of me saying anything?",
  "24998": "I make the first advances?",
  "24999": "Why strive for the knowledge of things if we become more cowardly thereby?",
  "25000": "Why, how do you come to be here?",
  "25001": "What the devil is he doing here?",
  "25002": "What's he to do with the lassie?",
  "25003": "Why must people kneel down to pray?",
  "25004": "Do you like him?",
  "25005": "First tell the boys, what we have decided?",
  "25006": "What is it to be?",
  "25007": "Tell us, dear, what do the creatures look like?",
  "25008": "Do you see that whale now?",
  "25009": "How is it that there are birds enough ready to replace immediately a lost mate of either sex?",
  "25010": "You admit, I hope, that I have a right to speak about what concerns the dignity of my wife's sister?",
  "25011": "Will somebody hand me anything hard and bruising to pelt at her?",
  "25012": "Is he industrious at his work and respectful to you?",
  "25013": "Could her face inspire passion at all now?",
  "25014": "Why ought I to know?",
  "25015": "And you are not furious?",
  "25016": "Will you let me go away?",
  "25017": "Or at some public school, perhaps?",
  "25018": "They do, do they?",
  "25019": "Is not the night mournful, sad, and melancholic?",
  "25020": "I asked them, if they were at liberty to tell me the truth of what they were to do with me?",
  "25021": "Why are you sorry, sir?",
  "25022": "What prison is he in?",
  "25023": "Shall we go on, your excellency, fine champagne?",
  "25024": "Leave our brother to come to us?",
  "25025": "Will you really not have tea?",
  "25026": "Whom do you expect to find here?",
  "25027": "Have you no other to propose?",
  "25028": "What can a writer, who professes scepticism, have in common with radical views?",
  "25029": "See that blue dory behind him?",
  "25030": "But is an education which ignores them all a liberal education?",
  "25031": "What upon?",
  "25032": "But who has told you?",
  "25033": "Where are my priwileges?",
  "25034": "Well, did she say what she was coming for?",
  "25035": "How can I ever thank you?",
  "25036": "You own the name and renounce the alias?",
  "25037": "Is he of noble family, and rich?",
  "25038": "How then are we to begin our strike to destroy him?",
  "25039": "Who is this boy?",
  "25040": "And who hit you at all?",
  "25041": "What are these men's leading principles, and about what kind of things are they busy, and for what kind of reasons do they love and honor?",
  "25042": "Thornfield?",
  "25043": "May I ask if you are very busy just now?",
  "25044": "How can it concern him to learn how the self came to be what it is, or what it will be in the distant future?",
  "25045": "You think it will?",
  "25046": "But why should I weary you with details?",
  "25047": "So you kept him after all?",
  "25048": "And the queen?",
  "25049": "That we see before our noses?",
  "25050": "Can I never tell my story in a plain, straightforward way?",
  "25051": "Can competition in labor be abolished?",
  "25052": "You cannot help us?",
  "25053": "But what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance?",
  "25054": "What was the use of his being somewhere in the neighbourhood if she had no means of knowing where she could find him?",
  "25055": "You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?",
  "25056": "You will protect me from him?",
  "25057": "Had you heard?",
  "25058": "Can you remember that?",
  "25059": "Ever live by cheating at play?",
  "25060": "Why do you permit such a surgeon to have the care of the sick, wounded, and dying soldiers?",
  "25061": "And is that why he hits her?",
  "25062": "Why, what is there to understand?",
  "25063": "Yet you have a large establishment, too, I am told?",
  "25064": "And you think that I am going to send you back to that world which must know me no more?",
  "25065": "What is done to infanticides in this country?",
  "25066": "And did you see anyone?",
  "25067": "Well, then, what makes you talk so wild?",
  "25068": "You have formed one, then?",
  "25069": "Will you please pardon my rudeness?",
  "25070": "My dear father, may I beg you to prepare your mind for what I am going to say?",
  "25071": "With what my father said just now?",
  "25072": "What did you think of that, sir?",
  "25073": "Would you like me to sit down for a minute or two?",
  "25074": "He is going with you, is he not?",
  "25075": "Of what disposition is he?",
  "25076": "What is it, then?",
  "25077": "Where did you really get them?",
  "25078": "What did you expect to gain by that?",
  "25079": "What heart can hold?",
  "25080": "Had he left her there to her fate in the lonely jungle?",
  "25081": "How do you do, all of you?",
  "25082": "Do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not talk as fast, and admire what she admires as rapturously as herself?",
  "25083": "Curious?",
  "25084": "Do you intend to sit up for me?",
  "25085": "But would the man acknowledge the relation?",
  "25086": "What are you doing now?",
  "25087": "Do you suppose that if I had made such a revelation to the king, I should have been alive now?",
  "25088": "He had a passion for pictures, and why should he not be able to paint as well as anybody else?",
  "25089": "Are you the gentleman who caused the accident?",
  "25090": "And the pay?",
  "25091": "Husband?",
  "25092": "I know what everyone would say is the right thing to do, but what do you say?",
  "25093": "What difference can it make to you?",
  "25094": "Was he a proprietor, or only a usufructuary?",
  "25095": "You have sold all your clothes?",
  "25096": "Surely you learnt that too?",
  "25097": "WHAT is it?",
  "25098": "But at this moment who knows if we may not be frightfully crushed between the two glassy surfaces?",
  "25099": "We must take care that that affair comes off all right, must we not?",
  "25100": "Why do you shake me like that?",
  "25101": "Now really should a cock be brought into a tragic play?",
  "25102": "Is his thread spun?",
  "25103": "Is it, then, impossible that, in the present condition of society, the workshop with its hierarchical organization, and machinery, instead of serving exclusively the interests of the least numerous, the least industrious, and the wealthiest class, should be employed for the benefit of all?",
  "25104": "Have not you an intimate friend?",
  "25105": "But how, and wherewith?",
  "25106": "That was a very different account of matters, was it not?",
  "25107": "What laws mean you?",
  "25108": "And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps?",
  "25109": "And on what will you sleep?",
  "25110": "That is what comes of your gospel of love, is it?",
  "25111": "Beautiful?",
  "25112": "Is it really possible that perfectly innocent people are kept here?",
  "25113": "You know the road?",
  "25114": "So if I say they're gone, you'll bear me witness, will you?",
  "25115": "Why should you not mention the sum?",
  "25116": "To what a devil, then, said he, serve so many paltry heaps and bundles of papers and copies which you give me?",
  "25117": "How did you get such small small legs?",
  "25118": "What is that news?",
  "25119": "His nieces accompany him, no doubt?",
  "25120": "Well, but whom are you attacking?",
  "25121": "Am I fool?",
  "25122": "What should hinder it?",
  "25123": "Is this true, my pulse?",
  "25124": "Have you given in your resignation, mademoiselle?",
  "25125": "How can you make yourself so inferior to me, as to show such a bad spirit?",
  "25126": "How can that be managed?",
  "25127": "When shall we be able to fish again?",
  "25128": "And what may your purpose be, most lofty lady?",
  "25129": "And when the better part of their products are consumed by others at the play, do you assure me that their families are not in want?",
  "25130": "Do I combine?",
  "25131": "What good was there in doing that?",
  "25132": "How can you do it seriously?",
  "25133": "Read?",
  "25134": "Was I absurd?",
  "25135": "Live like this?",
  "25136": "And if I could, what comfort to me?",
  "25137": "Aglaya, may I kiss YOUR prince?",
  "25138": "You mean to ask, I said, what will be our answer?",
  "25139": "You do not mean to inherit that infamous crotchet my brother has got into his head?",
  "25140": "Not a circus?",
  "25141": "Well, what have you got in your ear?",
  "25142": "What came of it?",
  "25143": "What makes it smell so funny?",
  "25144": "Which way are you going?",
  "25145": "Sure, little woman?",
  "25146": "The boy's, then?",
  "25147": "Why do you delay?",
  "25148": "Proud, eh?",
  "25149": "Since no man has aught of what he leaves, what is't to leave betimes?",
  "25150": "How is he?",
  "25151": "Were there not the brilliant particles of a halo in the air about his head?",
  "25152": "I therefore turned towards him with a stern countenance, and asked, who he called fool?",
  "25153": "You want me to swear?",
  "25154": "What you standing there for?",
  "25155": "Perhaps he is just as fond of suffering?",
  "25156": "What's the matter with you, old man?",
  "25157": "Married woman, I believe?",
  "25158": "Will you grant it to me?",
  "25159": "And the chin, with its dimples, as in health, might it not be hers?",
  "25160": "What will happen then?",
  "25161": "You mean that the thing is supernatural?",
  "25162": "And if I do speak to her, my lord, what then?",
  "25163": "Was it sufficient?",
  "25164": "Have you ever committed a sin?",
  "25165": "Presented to whom?",
  "25166": "Not for myself?",
  "25167": "Well, sir, will you go?",
  "25168": "Where did you go?",
  "25169": "What have we done?",
  "25170": "Do you jog hither, wagging your tails, to pant at my wine, and bepiss my barrel?",
  "25171": "What was going on in congress?",
  "25172": "Do you need a doctor?",
  "25173": "Why, oh why, have I betrayed myself?",
  "25174": "Had he any intellect, any thinking faculty, any consciousness of his own existence?",
  "25175": "Outspoken, is she?",
  "25176": "Is it honouring your husband to dishonour his business?",
  "25177": "To whom resort for relief?",
  "25178": "What must be done then?",
  "25179": "Are yours like that?",
  "25180": "And now, are you aware of one thing, monsieur?",
  "25181": "Is he on this farm?",
  "25182": "Now, did you not think so?",
  "25183": "What do men know about women's martyrdoms?",
  "25184": "What can be done?",
  "25185": "Is the room to be got ready upstairs?",
  "25186": "Will you be silent?",
  "25187": "But how could she?",
  "25188": "How shall I bring forth my wife?",
  "25189": "And the greater the interval which separates them from philosophy and reason, the more strange and illusive will be the pleasure?",
  "25190": "Does he also desire his archic man to be got up in a manner befitting royalty at a certain date?",
  "25191": "What can I do for you, my child?",
  "25192": "Well, the question is, what do you know about her?",
  "25193": "Suppose that she coulde pittie me, what then?",
  "25194": "Where is the child?",
  "25195": "What will you take?",
  "25196": "But who could have foreseen such an attention as this?",
  "25197": "Do you know I have entrusted him with our secret?",
  "25198": "Your sister is dead, then?",
  "25199": "What have I done to displease you?",
  "25200": "How begot, how nourished?",
  "25201": "What was the good of playing?",
  "25202": "Would she not be marvellously fair to look upon when in happy mood, seeing that she is so fair in her displeasure?",
  "25203": "Any youngsters?",
  "25204": "Can a man who possesses the slightest common sense be so unreasonable?",
  "25205": "Have you kept him in the cellar all this time?",
  "25206": "Did either of you boys touch it?",
  "25207": "Why has HE done nothing?",
  "25208": "Arrest you, my most faithful servant?",
  "25209": "Why did she betray the two of them so terribly, in embracing the glow of the evening?",
  "25210": "Are you a missionary?",
  "25211": "And in what condition?",
  "25212": "Did they have any repinings because of their course?",
  "25213": "You understand what I mean?",
  "25214": "You serve the cardinal?",
  "25215": "Where is his pistol?",
  "25216": "What DOES it call itself, I wonder?",
  "25217": "Was she not very much surprised?",
  "25218": "But what is that blockhead of a benevolent gentleman doing?",
  "25219": "And how do you know my heart is innocent?",
  "25220": "Shall I leave you?",
  "25221": "His blushes, his stumbles, his awkwardness, and the number of feet which he crushed as he went back to his place, who shall describe or calculate?",
  "25222": "So what does it matter?",
  "25223": "Or whether we should hold that cowardice makes no difference in the end, seeing that we all must share alike?",
  "25224": "You probably are not aware that I am here on a public kind of business, preposterous enough in itself, but which I have gone in for, and sworn by, and am supposed to be devoted to in quite a desperate manner?",
  "25225": "Now, do you find the business good, and the investment advantageous?",
  "25226": "And I dare say you sing a little, too?",
  "25227": "Was she normal?",
  "25228": "Are their heads off?",
  "25229": "This page or this page?",
  "25230": "What kind of a man is he?",
  "25231": "Will you tell me how that came about?",
  "25232": "For how can we know all the possible cases that may arise?",
  "25233": "Unfortunately, my lord, I am acquainted with nobody here but your grace, and if I should no longer find you, or if you should have forgotten me in your greatness?",
  "25234": "And why should she expect her brother to do that which her brother's guests would decline to do?",
  "25235": "What was there in the young girl's glance on this occasion?",
  "25236": "And then, why did he not at least answer it?",
  "25237": "But where are they, then?",
  "25238": "And then he can write back to my address, and I can smuggle the letter to you?",
  "25239": "Won what, ma'am?",
  "25240": "What dreadful thing drives her to say this, father, when it is such a pain to her?",
  "25241": "What then, my gentle sister?",
  "25242": "Which of the two will be the first to fall?",
  "25243": "Was this the right corner to turn?",
  "25244": "What are we?",
  "25245": "Who of you have done more?",
  "25246": "Get it?",
  "25247": "Whose hand's out?",
  "25248": "Alas, do you love nothing else in me?",
  "25249": "Shall we send the watch there?",
  "25250": "Would you mind my taking 'em out and looking at 'em for a minute, to see how they are made?",
  "25251": "Would you believe it?",
  "25252": "But you were married?",
  "25253": "Jespersen?",
  "25254": "Is papa alive?",
  "25255": "How is she?",

  "25935": "Why was it none would give it, then?",
  "25936": "Shall they be banished from the district, or from the whole land?",
  "25937": "Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?",
  "25938": "Did I abuse you?",
  "25939": "You who see your betters bearing up under this shame every day, meekly suffering under the slights of fortune, gentle and unpitied, poor, and rather despised for their poverty, do you ever step down from your prosperity and wash the feet of these poor wearied beggars?",

  "25951": "Was he again to be disturbed?",
  "25952": "Was she going to act and keep house?",
  "25953": "But why does he have this idea of a horse?",
  "25954": "Was that his work or was it possibly the doing of someone who was bent upon counteracting his schemes?",
  "25955": "Two minutes wrong?",
  "25956": "Do you not guess, monsieur?",
  "25957": "Where's your horse?",

  "25977": "What's that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for?",
  "25978": "On which of these actions did he reflect with the most pleasure, when he was summoned by the angel of death?",
  "25979": "What was in there?",
  "25980": "But tell me, what is she?",
  "25981": "Is he ungrateful to no one else?",
  "25982": "Aye, how do you know he is?",

  "25987": "You imagine, I dare say, that you invented something quite new?",
  "25988": "Is there anything in what I say, or am I talking to no purpose?",
  "25989": "Was he already with the queen?",
  "25990": "What is the matter, that with all his ill usage of me, I cannot hate him?",
  "25991": "Now, I beseech you, do tell me, have you ever attended to their pairing and breeding?",
  "25992": "Oh, what have I done to be blessed with such friends?",
  "25993": "Two one pound notes, or friends?",
  "25994": "Why indeed should they maintain a watch?",
  "25995": "What was I to do?",
  "25996": "So will you abandon your plan?",
  "25997": "What can I say that will enable you to understand the depth of my sorrow?",
  "25998": "Did she still love him?",
  "25999": "What you 'bout?",
  "26000": "And of the pleasures of love, and all other pleasures, the same holds good?",
  "26001": "What does she want?",
  "26002": "Will it be safe to leave you there alone?",
  "26003": "In your room?",
  "26004": "Can dignity of mind exist with such trivial cares?",
  "26005": "Are they dead, ma'am?",
  "26006": "And what shall we have in lieu of it?",
  "26007": "It is a lovely night, and why should we not prolong our ride a little?",
  "26008": "You will not come?",
  "26009": "For arrears of pay?",
  "26010": "Copperfield, my dear fellow, how do you do?",
  "26011": "And is the city which is under a tyrant rich or poor?",
  "26012": "Was it not too clear that, let the matter go how it would, there was no happiness in store for her?",
  "26013": "Would you kindly send one of your constables for two buckets of water?",
  "26014": "But what is there, then, above the sun?",
  "26015": "Why are they not given up to the church, as they ought to be?",
  "26016": "To conceal his name?",
  "26017": "Is it at some set season?",
  "26018": "Did she know anything of his life upon the sea?",
  "26019": "Where is so awful a responsibility laid upon them?",
  "26020": "Well, my boy, what's there to prevent you?",
  "26021": "What more natural, after this, than the dream which came to him?",
  "26022": "If vices be genuine and virtue a deception, as you think, why do you call the inventors of that deceiving art sages?",
  "26023": "Has the law any eyes to witness your grief?",
  "26024": "How can I be vain when I know I'm homely?",

  "26037": "Was it mere social effect, fulfilment of ambition in the social world, in the community of mankind?",
  "26038": "How about this ad of yours?",
  "26039": "Do you still suppose that I am a boy ignorant of my own mind, and mistaking the impulses of my own soul?",
  "26040": "Must we then not be married, in order to sanctify the union of our hearts?",
  "26041": "Ay, but will you promise to come?",
  "26042": "What did you write about?",
  "26043": "Perhaps you are laughing again?",
  "26044": "So you think that these people have already quitted the island?",
  "26045": "What's a lad with good friends doing as loblolly boy?",
  "26046": "Who can tell if that mind, when the touchstone is applied to it, will not be found of a mean and vulgar character?",
  "26047": "But what time's breakfast, sir?",
  "26048": "Did you signal us, lording?",
  "26049": "Where was you raised?",

  "26051": "Where is the treasure?",
  "26052": "You know?",
  "26053": "Snatch at it?",
  "26054": "Would not this mode of proceeding be preferable to that of causing letters to be opened by any one who may be employed, and replying to them by a circular to which it is only necessary to attach a date?",
  "26055": "Well, what say you to a friend that would take this bitter bargain off your hands?",
  "26056": "Just step into this corner a moment, will you?",
  "26057": "What will you do, dear?",
  "26058": "Who shall prevent him?",
  "26059": "Is it a profession?",

  "26089": "Where did you go this morning?",
  "26090": "So very soon?",
  "26091": "Well, sir, in writing against property, have I done more than quote the language of history?",
  "26092": "I unhappy?",
  "26093": "But how did he come by his death?",
  "26094": "Can you believe it?",
  "26095": "Do you think that was done last night?",
  "26096": "Which is the way to the chapel?",
  "26097": "May we, then, be permitted to speak of the past in the present?",
  "26098": "What victim?",

  "26107": "What is bad?",
  "26108": "And what now?",
  "26109": "Was he actually in hiding from the police?",
  "26110": "Shall he in the meantime risk the character and interest of the nation in the hands of men to whom he can not give his confidence?",
  "26111": "In the tremendous breaking forth of a whole people, in which all degrees, tempers and characters are confounded, delivering themselves, by a miracle of exertion, from the destruction meditated against them, is it to be expected that nothing will happen?",
  "26112": "What's the meaning of this?",
  "26113": "But how was it possible to effect this?",
  "26114": "Will you let me?",
  "26115": "And look you, lord, times are not ill, so wherefore should I risk a change of days?",
  "26116": "That certainly seems a satisfactory explanation, does it not?",
  "26117": "You have my birth certificate?",
  "26118": "Is it an odd speech, papa?",
  "26119": "Had you not observed it before?",
  "26120": "Who would attend him when he was sick?",
  "26121": "Till to your very doors the war be brought?",

  "26125": "Why, indeed?",
  "26126": "Shall you?",
  "26127": "But how came the hand to discompose you so much, if it was only a letter of business?",
  "26128": "Why did this sudden conviction of a religious woman cast a terrible doubt in my mind?",
  "26129": "Was that then he or an inhuman thing moved by a lower soul?",
  "26130": "And the power which the eye possesses is a sort of effluence which is dispensed from the sun?",
  "26131": "What was one to think or feel?",
  "26132": "Can you tell the position of the rooms?",

  "26138": "You know that to be so?",
  "26139": "Was it possible to render any aid to the dying man?",
  "26140": "Widowed mother, perhaps?",
  "26141": "Has she mentioned me lately?",
  "26142": "And what your sorrow?",
  "26143": "Did you speak, my own?",
  "26144": "Is it only a voice?",

  "26149": "But how can I pay them?",
  "26150": "How was this done?",
  "26151": "Away from me?",
  "26152": "And, if so, surely there is good material in you?",
  "26153": "What was the matter with you, baron?",

  "26155": "Will you come into the garden?",
  "26156": "Will it satisfy them, in the future, if we have nothing to do with invasions and insurrections?",
  "26157": "But what are we to do with her when we have caught her?",
  "26158": "And what do you say of lovers of wine?",
  "26159": "Where now the splendid future of her poor duped children?",
  "26160": "So that is what you wanted the money for?",
  "26161": "Would you like to take her place?",
  "26162": "Was it in the papers yet?",
  "26163": "What had become of that fair fellowship, so closely bound together by public and private ties, so resplendent with every talent and accomplishment?",
  "26164": "Who lives to the left there?",
  "26165": "Where shall we have tea?",
  "26166": "Would she ever die?",
  "26167": "And had the leather interior lasted with the felt cap through seven centuries?",
  "26168": "But why should anyone take it in order to keep it in his house?",
  "26169": "What will happen now?",
  "26170": "Next, how can the posting be accomplished in these mountainous parts?",
  "26171": "Does your soul belong to him now?",
  "26172": "How is man to know?",
  "26173": "And what can I do for you, esteemed prince?",
  "26174": "But this letter in which he recommends you to me?",
  "26175": "What are bulbs?",
  "26176": "Would you like to ferry me over?",
  "26177": "I hope your respected father is well, sir?",
  "26178": "And what, my lord, has been my fault?",
  "26179": "Then what is the illness itself?",
  "26180": "Is that what you've been so funny about this evening?",
  "26181": "But you are half asleep, are you not?",
  "26182": "Of whom?",
  "26183": "And suppose I were to die?",
  "26184": "I wonder where they do go, by the by?",
  "26185": "Is the well where you got this water near at hand?",
  "26186": "And does your honor know the four men who undertook to rescue him?",
  "26187": "Did you still hear the knocking?",
  "26188": "But to what place was I to go?",
  "26189": "Would you work for four and a half a week?",
  "26190": "You have a child?",
  "26191": "Can any man think it would be wise to leave such posts in a situation to be at any instant seized by one or the other of two neighboring and formidable powers?",
  "26192": "How shall we punish him for such a speech?",
  "26193": "What can be plainer than that the webbed feet of ducks and geese are formed for swimming?",
  "26194": "The sun?",
  "26195": "Diana?",
  "26196": "But who was she?",
  "26197": "Have you been in others?",

  "26200": "She asked, if she should call me again?",
  "26201": "Have you been there long?",
  "26202": "Do I interrupt?",
  "26203": "But it is quite understood, is it not?",
  "26204": "Will you carry him?",
  "26205": "Neither will he ever break faith where there have been oaths or agreements?",
  "26206": "If he comes back again, father?",
  "26207": "But who can tell what had happened?",
  "26208": "What then, I shall be asked, prevents these things from taking place with such regularity and precision?",
  "26209": "Who is the lady?",
  "26210": "And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?",
  "26211": "Is it not a just retribution?",
  "26212": "And where are the bodies?",
  "26213": "What do you say to coffee?",
  "26214": "Then we are friends?",
  "26215": "It was four years ago that I had it made, and what do you think I chose for the word and figures?",
  "26216": "Can I have missed it?",
  "26217": "WHICH candle?",
  "26218": "Shall we take their horses out, or tell them to find friends elsewhere as they best can?",
  "26219": "How much longer will you stay here?",
  "26220": "Is yours a hooky or a nobbly?",

  "26222": "And it is to you, you graceless varlet, I owe all this?",
  "26223": "I have spoken of this because I keep wanting to know for a fact whether other people feel such enjoyment?",
  "26224": "Who is the fellow with him?",
  "26225": "And what will happen now?",
  "26226": "Can we be so unwise as to mean, that she shall keep a navy in our harbours for that purpose?",
  "26227": "Do you think that you are going to stay here?",
  "26228": "Are you going away, or has something happened?",
  "26229": "At the point where the path passes through the gate, you could surely pick up the tracks?",
  "26230": "What have we for lunch?",
  "26231": "Then it's a go, eh?",
  "26232": "What is't?",
  "26233": "Because she was there?",
  "26234": "Can you, of all the people who love her, bear to see her so?",
  "26235": "And if we had not arrived, what would you have done?",
  "26236": "Should you like me to take down his hat to him?",
  "26237": "Honest?",
  "26238": "Are all the flowers dead, or do some of them come again in the summer?",
  "26239": "Can one work there?",
  "26240": "Doing?",
  "26241": "I mean, will you be good to us, or do you intend to eat us?",
  "26242": "Will there be roses?",
  "26243": "Who gives you your maintenance, I pray you?",
  "26244": "What makes you pant so, my friend?",
  "26245": "Is it his fault that he is so ugly, and has so little sense?",
  "26246": "And what due or proper thing is given by cookery, and to what?",
  "26247": "Do you take me vor a shicken ?",
  "26248": "What are you to do?",
  "26249": "And why do you ask that?",
  "26250": "What is it, grandmother?",
  "26251": "What's the good of stopping?",
  "26252": "Had I right, for my own benefit, to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations?",
  "26253": "Have not often the profoundest efforts of genius been used to baffle the aspirations of the reader, to raise false hopes and false fears, and to give rise to expectations which are never realised?",
  "26254": "Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?",
  "26255": "By whose means?",
  "26256": "How much do you own?",
  "26257": "And the lakes, cousin, what do you say of them?",
  "26258": "Is that possible?",
  "26259": "What do you mean by lagging and a lifer?",
  "26260": "Are there no honest ones?",
  "26261": "And what is THAT to me?",
  "26262": "Are you unwell today?",
  "26263": "Phips had compromised, and why not he?",
  "26264": "To the office?",
  "26265": "Why should he bear all this?",
  "26266": "Successfully, I hope?",
  "26267": "Have you not heard the astonishing intelligence regarding her surreptitious union?",
  "26268": "Yet, what have I got to do with it?",
  "26269": "Still he's not worth her little finger, is he?",
  "26270": "Is the baby all right?",
  "26271": "Has she been stolen?",
  "26272": "Why must she do it?",
  "26273": "And by what means our news to him repeat?",
  "26274": "What in the world was the meaning of this?",
  "26275": "Is it possible that this stranger has now become everything to me?",
  "26276": "The question arises, what disposition are we to make of our accumulating funds?",
  "26277": "Is it of any use for me to tell you again why we must try to part with the house?",
  "26278": "How comes it that you would not answer my greetings for so long?",
  "26279": "And what did the firm say?",
  "26280": "You do think I could do some good at it, if I were to try?",
  "26281": "But what is to be done, old man?",
  "26282": "As they are or as they appear?",
  "26283": "What do I want with them?",
  "26284": "Where is that secretary person?",
  "26285": "What could he do, even supposing himself strong enough to fight the battle?",
  "26286": "Can one be too much alive, too happy?",
  "26287": "Who are to be the objects of popular choice?",
  "26288": "But will not the general be too hospitable for you?",
  "26289": "And that's the lad, sir, is it?",
  "26290": "Which road?",
  "26291": "And me?",
  "26292": "Oh, so it's not time to die yet?",

  "26314": "Who speaks for this cub?",
  "26315": "Is it not very unwise in us to go on spending the little money we've got when I can keep down expenditures by an honest occupation?",
  "26316": "What ought they to be allowed, or not allowed, to do, be, and suffer?",
  "26317": "How long have you been there?",
  "26318": "I may well be allowed to ask what has made my maid of honor, who left the festive hall sick, now all at once so well that she goes roaming about the castle in the night time, and in a dress which seems likely to be mistaken for mine?",

  "26320": "What, then, prevented charity, union, sacrifice from maintaining themselves in the hierarchy, when the hierarchy might have been only a condition of labor?",
  "26321": "But what, miss?",
  "26322": "Observe, my friends, that in the position occupied by the projectile, an oblique position with regard to the lunar disc, our rockets, in slightly altering its direction, might turn it from the moon instead of drawing it nearer?",
  "26323": "And you never by any chance lose sight of him, I presume?",
  "26324": "Should we go now?",
  "26325": "How is one to vanish partly?",
  "26326": "Who was it that was eaten?",
  "26327": "Can I have another piece?",
  "26328": "Where is the use of the devil in that sentence?",
  "26329": "Whereabouts?",
  "26330": "Yet how can I let this knavish dog die and lose the money?",

  "26342": "Do you believe you have still a certain amount of it to expend this evening?",
  "26343": "Then why in the world not?",
  "26344": "What are they then?",
  "26345": "What can you love me for?",
  "26346": "Is he a presentable sort of a person?",

  "26348": "But what was his name?",
  "26349": "What do you mean by gone?",
  "26350": "Is not it what you have often wished to do yourself?",
  "26351": "Would a boat be waiting for us with supplies and letters?",
  "26352": "What must have been his feelings?",
  "26353": "And shall we ever come into our own again?",
  "26354": "What do you want, my pretty?",
  "26355": "Supposing him to be attached to me, would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?",
  "26356": "But suppose she had run against this piece of iron?",
  "26357": "Who will be the jury?",
  "26358": "You think, then, that you can help me more efficaciously than your brothers?",
  "26359": "And do you think it's true?",
  "26360": "Shall there never be a fresh opportunity of trying the ranges of projectiles?",
  "26361": "Did he wake up?",
  "26362": "Was he nice?",
  "26363": "And now what will we do?",
  "26364": "Do you not know?",

  "26375": "Do you believe he can?",
  "26376": "Who has seen her?",
  "26377": "What did he mean by such a pagan idea?",
  "26378": "Was it because at that time we passed for very rich people, and you were afraid of being refused?",
  "26379": "And besides, what have I done to bring it about?",
  "26380": "Alas, what shall I wretched wight become?",
  "26381": "But suppose it's a woman?",
  "26382": "Why am I to give an account of myself?",
  "26383": "What's that you tell me?",
  "26384": "What colorable reason could be assigned, in a country so situated, for such vast augmentations of the military force?",
  "26385": "Is this too little?",
  "26386": "For the last three months?",

  "26392": "What do you wish, gentlemen?",
  "26393": "What does she?",
  "26394": "What, then, is the use of your worship?",
  "26395": "Was the gate open?",
  "26396": "Shall us begin it now?",
  "26397": "A recruit, sir, I understand?",
  "26398": "Sir?",
  "26399": "Yet could a woman who had done even what she had done deserve all this?",
  "26400": "But who would do it?",
  "26401": "Has not your father already his sixth wife?",
  "26402": "I ask, is it not as good a rule for him as it is for me?",
  "26403": "WHAT do you call him?",
  "26404": "Who is coward now?",
  "26405": "Have they nothing better to do?",
  "26406": "Are you feeling any better?",
  "26407": "Do you think I care more for my dress than for my little girl?",
  "26408": "What man of taste and feeling can endure rifacimenti, harmonies, abridgments, expurgated editions?",
  "26409": "Faucheux?",
  "26410": "And do you think that you would be happy with her, or she with you, after what has passed?",
  "26411": "Do you ask their pardon of me?",
  "26412": "Who can possibly have told you I had had that dream?",
  "26413": "And this is the return you make me for all the indulgences I've heaped on you?",
  "26414": "Why not raise it five more?",
  "26415": "Will you let me tell you?",

  "26823": "When do we hear of women, who starting out of obscurity, boldly claim respect on account of their great abilities or daring virtues?",
  "26824": "But where is the old man?",
  "26825": "You recollect that first night, when I was so unpolite and inky?",
  "26826": "But if you will come and live with me, papa?",
  "26827": "You think there is no hope?",
  "26828": "Do you wish to go there?",
  "26829": "Are we all ready?",
  "26830": "What do you want to rush out for this way?",
  "26831": "Where does this animal live, and what is the use of that plant?",
  "26832": "And a man helpin' on her up the bank?",
  "26833": "Markleham?",
  "26834": "Holyhead?",
  "26835": "I should be glad to know whether, when I have put on my green robe in spring, the trees do not afterwards do the same?",
  "26836": "Will you?",
  "26837": "Then where does the vanity come in?",
  "26838": "But what were you to do with that woman?",
  "26839": "What does that signify, so long as they favor your suit?",
  "26840": "Do you want to stay here all day?",
  "26841": "Have you a pen?",
  "26842": "What's to become of me?",
  "26843": "What is a power, but the ability or faculty of doing a thing?",
  "26844": "Is it?",
  "26845": "Now, was there ever, since men emerged from a state of utter barbarism, an age in which there were no debts?",
  "26846": "Does any one believe that, if the merchants interested in the course of the navigable way had been charged with the enterprise at their own risk and peril, they would have had to do their work twice?",
  "26847": "There are whalers in these quarters, then?",
  "26848": "You went out with them, of course?",
  "26849": "Do they measure the king, too?",
  "26850": "And twisted it into thread?",
  "26851": "Where was he sitting?",
  "26852": "A setback?",
  "26853": "You will call me sister, will you not?",
  "26854": "Had she heard aright?",
  "26855": "Did we reach any goals?",
  "26856": "Whither was it going?",
  "26857": "And, suppose I should wish to be married to the man that I love?",
  "26858": "Did these men arrive here voluntarily or involuntarily, by disembarking on the shore or by being wrecked?",
  "26859": "Are you going too?",
  "26860": "Did you think there was nothing but evil at the bottom of them?",
  "26861": "What would she do?",
  "26862": "This vexes you?",
  "26863": "And what do I see here, monsieur?",
  "26864": "Will he not think that the pleasure of riches is vulgar, while the pleasure of learning, if it brings no distinction, is all smoke and nonsense to him?",
  "26865": "Why should she disappoint those expectations because of the imperious demands of a very highly excited boy?",
  "26866": "Good heavens, why should I?",
  "26867": "For an augury of good or evil?",
  "26868": "What is he doing?",
  "26869": "Why on earth should you doubt them?",
  "26870": "And are we convinced that all of them are generated out of opposites?",
  "26871": "He's got a pretty strong string round your father's leg, by what I hear, eh?",
  "26872": "Please, where ARE the crabs?",
  "26873": "If we had had provisions enough for months, how could we get out of the abyss into which we were being hurled by an irresistible torrent?",
  "26874": "May I ask how old he is, ma'am?",
  "26875": "Did you ever see her?",
  "26876": "But what on earth did she mean?",
  "26877": "What besides?",
  "26878": "And why do you stand there gaping?",
  "26879": "Contempt, my friend?",
  "26880": "What's the right way to knock?",
  "26881": "Every mornin' do?",
  "26882": "And in what did that which has taken place concern you?",
  "26883": "What could that mean?",
  "26884": "You are her father?",
  "26885": "Are your wife and children destitute of a bed to lie on, or bread to live on?",
  "26886": "What will he do?",
  "26887": "Why disgrace me before the army?",
  "26888": "You came seeking me to make to me certain proposals, but did you make them?",
  "26889": "And why were you crying so just now?",
  "26890": "And will you get him first thing in the morning?",
  "26891": "What will you do with the light?",
  "26892": "Have you come up determined not to deal?",
  "26893": "You have heard and understood what your granddaughter has been saying, sir, have you?",
  "26894": "What could they desire beyond their liberty?",
  "26895": "Edlin?",
  "26896": "What shall we do with him?",
  "26897": "I should like to deal him a blow, but can I actually do it?",
  "26898": "Do you know what time your father will be back?",
  "26899": "But who, then, is this assassin, this murderer?",
  "26900": "Why did he urge me so little about the princess?",
  "26901": "What is the meaning of their eternal care and worry?",
  "26902": "Were his eyes deceiving him?",
  "26903": "And you spoke to him?",
  "26904": "What's the trouble?",
  "26905": "Give who?",
  "26906": "Anything else?",
  "26907": "Are you mad enough to leave this house?",
  "26908": "How long have you been engaged in the practice of medicine?",
  "26909": "What of it?",
  "26910": "Then it will be our duty to select, if we can, natures which are fitted for the task of guarding the city?",
  "26911": "Why not end my misery now rather than drag out a few more wretched days in this dark pit?",
  "26912": "Why did you lend an ear to the temptings of friends?",
  "26913": "What do you understand of the affair?",
  "26914": "Are we to pass the night in the king's room?",
  "26915": "Not about money, I hope?",
  "26916": "Extraordinary, did you say?",
  "26917": "Why should you interfere?",
  "26918": "Gania, what are you standing there for?",
  "26919": "But why, of all others, choose these?",
  "26920": "Ever so little did you say, gossip?",
  "26921": "Are you in need of soothsaying?",
  "26922": "An incendiary, then?",
  "26923": "To come at call?",
  "26924": "Have I time?",
  "26925": "Do they live?",
  "26926": "And this is all?",
  "26927": "You mean that you want to go away from me?",
  "26928": "Now, my friends, can the country be saved upon that basis?",
  "26929": "What, billing so sweetly?",
  "26930": "Well, then what of it?",
  "26931": "What would my islanders say when they heard their governor was going, strolling about on the winds?",
  "26932": "But, guardian, may we not hope that a little experience will teach him what a false and wretched thing it is?",
  "26933": "Have you told them to bring the horse?",
  "26934": "Will you then believe, you dear, foolish enthusiast, that I love you, and that it is no demon that rests here in your arms and swears that she loves nothing but you?",
  "26935": "What are we doing?",
  "26936": "Well, did you see them fly?",
  "26937": "What are you up to?",
  "26938": "And that's why you trust him, eh?",
  "26939": "And what does he think of it?",
  "26940": "What sort of an education could they have got in the country?",
  "26941": "How do you go back?",
  "26942": "How old is your sister?",
  "26943": "Were they in the tent?",
  "26944": "Some poaching case, no doubt?",
  "26945": "What is that for?",
  "26946": "On what occasion?",
  "26947": "But were there no reasons why I should avoid you?",
  "26948": "Would it not be of some assistance, if we knew of what substance it is composed?",
  "26949": "Had she only been guilty of silence as to his fate?",
  "26950": "Shall I take it down for you?",
  "26951": "What about, papa?",
  "26952": "But I suppose there is no fire?",
  "26953": "Why should she talk of her own unhappiness?",
  "26954": "Where do you suppose him to be?",
  "26955": "And what means are ours, of attaining the truth?",
  "26956": "You mean?",
  "26957": "Please, sir, be this note for you?",
  "26958": "Surely I can never have seriously written such a silly motto as that?",
  "26959": "Have you made up your mind when you shall be there yourself?",
  "26960": "Need it go on?",
  "26961": "How can you love a girl, and yet so humiliate her as to throw her over for the sake of another woman, before the very eyes of that other woman, when you have already made her a formal proposal of marriage?",
  "26962": "What was going on in that mind which was so young and yet already so impenetrable?",
  "26963": "What shall become of this?",
  "26964": "But how was this to be done, when he had no revenue, often not means enough for necessary expenses?",
  "26965": "What steps have you taken?",
  "26966": "And now?",
  "26967": "What was that they said?",
  "26968": "Why should any one murder a man in so clumsy a fashion as by hanging him?",

  "26971": "Should he knock as of old?",
  "26972": "Nothing about the silver calabash he spat into?",
  "26973": "But what availeth it?",
  "26974": "Where then lay the spots of commonness?",
  "26975": "Who will volunteer for the job?",
  "26976": "How do we stand in point of time, constable, eh?",
  "26977": "Did I not promise?",
  "26978": "Well, who said it was?",
  "26979": "I suppose your people all do this?",
  "26980": "Did anyone send you, sir?",
  "26981": "What then do you know?",
  "26982": "But where could a dog have come from?",
  "26983": "What shall I do with this beastly tumbril?",
  "26984": "Do I excuse her for it?",
  "26985": "Who is it that compels them to borne along?",
  "26986": "Did any of you gentlemen want to have it out with ME?",

  "26991": "Do you want her?",
  "26992": "To what, then, do we owe these blessings?",
  "26993": "In other words, how, from the nature of universal human reason, do those questions arise which pure reason proposes to itself, and which it is impelled by its own feeling of need to answer as well as it can?",
  "26994": "Runic?",
  "26995": "And would you not say that he is temperate who has these same elements in friendly harmony, in whom the one ruling principle of reason, and the two subject ones of spirit and desire are equally agreed that reason ought to rule, and do not rebel?",
  "26996": "I say, shall we soon be clear?",
  "26997": "Slid, sir, what should you behold in my face, sir, that should move you, as they say, sir, to ask me, sir, if I would sell my rapier?",
  "26998": "Am I worth anything now, since you have got into such high favor?",
  "26999": "Will nothing make you understand?",
  "27000": "Tell me would you rob?",
  "27001": "Ah, it's you?",
  "27002": "Is it possible under the conditions to enlarge the work of practical teaching and practical examination which is the one desire of those who administer the department?",
  "27003": "What more can the devil do than strangle us?",
  "27004": "Anything more?",
  "27005": "What does it matter, when you come to think of it, whether a child is yours by blood or not?",
  "27006": "I passed you on the road?",
  "27007": "And what makes you think?",
  "27008": "Is he come back, then?",
  "27009": "Why do you cast those anxious looks on each other?",
  "27010": "Finished what, may I ask?",
  "27011": "Why, they say, is he not perfect in his training?",
  "27012": "Njal went on to ask, whether he had a right of action against all of them, or whether the leaders had to answer for them all in the suit?",
  "27013": "Will you swear it?",
  "27014": "Does your excellency wish for a receipt?",
  "27015": "What experiment?",

  "27021": "Meditatin', eh?",
  "27022": "Next time you roust me out, you hear?",
  "27023": "But it's not serious?",
  "27024": "We knew you were going to get married, did we?",
  "27025": "Why make a long story of what took but five minutes to do?",
  "27026": "Why with disgust?",
  "27027": "What mill?",
  "27028": "What evil spirit has taken possession of your heart that you should be so wicked?",

  "27139": "Can I speak with him?",
  "27140": "And to feel not exactly dull, but sad?",
  "27141": "Was it near, was it far?",
  "27142": "Neither, I said, can there be any question that the guardian who is to keep anything should have eyes rather than no eyes?",
  "27143": "Damn it, did you then take me along with you for your chaplain, to sing mass and shrive you?",
  "27144": "What is the liberty of the press?",
  "27145": "Would she throw away the inestimable advantage of royal protection?",
  "27146": "In whom can we trust?",
  "27147": "Then how is it that you did not go?",
  "27148": "And what reward have they?",
  "27149": "Would you care to try it?",
  "27150": "See what, sir?",
  "27151": "What else could I say when he asked me?",
  "27152": "Are you willing to carry us through the air wherever we wish to go?",
  "27153": "Suppose it was all a gigantic mistake?",
  "27154": "Why out of the question?",
  "27155": "Is your secret of enough importance to me to spare your life for it?",

  "27196": "She and I were like sisters, and now she is gone, will you not let me be like a sister to you in your trouble?",
  "27197": "And is there any opposite to life?",
  "27198": "Well?",
  "27199": "What am I to do if I love nothing but fame and men's esteem?",

  "27632": "But after that?",
  "27633": "But do you really WANT sensuality?",
  "27634": "Will you just turn this nab of heath, and walk into my house?",
  "27635": "Would you do it?",
  "27636": "Now since the fancy finds the same facility in passing from the lesser to the greater, as from remote to contiguous, why does not this easy transition of ideas assist the transition of passions in the former case, as well as in the latter?",

  "27658": "With what people takes he this task in hand?",
  "27659": "Taken the goose?",
  "27660": "Is your vessel a swift one?",
  "27661": "Or if it be possible to imagine, that such errors are the sources of all immorality?",

  "28360": "And as to her face, could it inspire nothing but passion?",
  "28361": "What was it then, and how had it affected his fate?",
  "28362": "Manager to a diamond merchant, or some such thing, is he not?",
  "28363": "And he does forgive?",
  "28364": "When all that failed, he boldly accosted him, and asked him, whether he did not remember him?",
  "28365": "Or, whither he should go?",

  "28382": "Where did your instructions come from?",
  "28383": "Why, then, monseigneur does not know?",
  "28384": "But, gentlemen, why are you getting angry again?",
  "28385": "And now it is you who have brought them together again?",
  "28386": "Was there not a spirit in him which, silent as it was, burned on him like the fires of perdition?",
  "28387": "Hurt you?",
  "28388": "What visions, they asked, could one but read them, must lie behind the quiet, dreaming eyes of that inscrutable face?",
  "28389": "What resources could they expect to find upon that scene of desolation?",
  "28390": "May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?",
  "28391": "Are you reconciled?",
  "28392": "Are you nothing?",
  "28393": "But what could have frightened the creatures so, and driven them from their haunts, when they ought to have been quietly sleeping?",
  "28394": "Or would you include the mixed?",
  "28395": "Was it a screw or thrust?",
  "28396": "Ah, then, is THAT what you've stayed over for?",
  "28397": "Do you know that he's the honestest and faithfullest fellow that ever lived, and that he has an irreproachable good name?",
  "28398": "What do you think of it, now?",
  "28399": "Why not?",
  "28400": "Always busy at what?",
  "28401": "How is it possible for him to be attained to?",
  "28402": "Is it finished?",
  "28403": "What do you mean?",
  "28404": "Do you hesitate?",
  "28405": "Is there any one in the lobby?",
  "28406": "I like the baron, but what better gifts can marriage bestow, than I already possess?",
  "28407": "Is not that saying illustrated by this?",
  "28408": "What's he?",
  "28409": "Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?",
  "28410": "Silver?",
  "28411": "Are we going to continue this pace all night?",
  "28412": "Can I be so lucky as to find what everybody is seeking for?",
  "28413": "Face?",
  "28414": "What else have you done?",
  "28415": "It stung you up a bit when I spoke of your game leg, young fellow?",
  "28416": "Sire, will you allow me to speak frankly as befits a loyal soldier?",
  "28417": "Then why speak to me about it?",
  "28418": "What the devil do I do?",
  "28419": "Who would ever know?",
  "28420": "Was I very gleeful, settled, content, during the hours I passed in yonder bare, humble schoolroom this morning and afternoon?",
  "28421": "Who will shrive the poor wretch, if you have come away from him?",
  "28422": "Why should I do so?",
  "28423": "And then she could not help remembering that he had passed some time with her under like circumstances, so why should there be any unfitness in the fact?",
  "28424": "Is there no mistake?",
  "28425": "Must he not have the qualities of a sage?",
  "28426": "Why is the sycophant thus added to the hypocrite, and the man who pretends to govern, sunk into the humble and submissive memorialist?",

  "28430": "Whatever her sins, they were not sins of intention, but of inadvertence, and why should she have been punished so persistently?",
  "28431": "What was the bargain?",
  "28432": "And his dog also?",
  "28433": "Must I call you a liar as well as a thief?",
  "28434": "Why did you bring me here?",
  "28435": "If he could not speak, how was she to do so?",
  "28436": "And he will accomplish the trip?",
  "28437": "Is he mad?",
  "28438": "What is she there for?",
  "28439": "YOU insulted ME?",
  "28440": "And now, matey, did that doctor say how long I was to lie here in this old berth?",
  "28441": "My companion?",
  "28442": "For how can one?",
  "28443": "Game for a morning drive?",
  "28444": "You know where you left the team?",
  "28445": "How much have you lost?",
  "28446": "The boy's name?",
  "28447": "Why do you want to start on that again?",
  "28448": "And you yourself, what do you think about it?",
  "28449": "Why do you say I do not regard it?",
  "28450": "Must we, then, give up to despair?",
  "28451": "But where the devil are you?",
  "28452": "Living?",
  "28453": "Do you know what you have said?",
  "28454": "Well, and what has she been doing?",
  "28455": "Shall we not spend our immortal life together?",
  "28456": "Would this political deterrence prove acceptable to allies and to our own public?",
  "28457": "Should not all they be called mercenary who are always seeking consolations?",
  "28458": "Where is it, then?",
  "28459": "Do you really mean that?",

  "28465": "Who knows the will of heaven?",
  "28466": "What's that?",
  "28467": "Who's the object of your meditation, sir?",
  "28468": "Would you not say that he is entirely concerned with the soul and not with the body?",
  "28469": "Have we not?",
  "28470": "What does she think herself about him?",
  "28471": "Do you hate me so much as all that?",
  "28472": "Is not this to be rich?",
  "28473": "Should you like to retire at once?",
  "28474": "Will you ever go back?",
  "28475": "Why conceal your real feelings?",
  "28476": "In a hospital?",
  "28477": "Have you no information as to his abiding place?",
  "28478": "What is come of the troops that were encamped beside my palace?",
  "28479": "What's your names?",
  "28480": "For what reason is all this fume and fury?",
  "28481": "Of the painter we say that he will paint reins, and he will paint a bit?",
  "28482": "Will you ride on a few paces with the princess?",
  "28483": "Can you wash your own hands, or shall I wash them for you?",
  "28484": "And when shall we have the honor of seeing you again, your excellency?",
  "28485": "Are you interested in the sugar question?",
  "28486": "And they will go in three days now?",
  "28487": "But what good could he have done if he had?",
  "28488": "And what probability was there that a mere drudge would be able to manage a large and stormy assembly, abounding with able and experienced men?",
  "28489": "Gave him leave?",
  "28490": "You have, then, overheard our conversation?",
  "28491": "Will they sacrifice opportunity for the distressed, the beauty of our land, the hope of our poor?",
  "28492": "Esther, will you forgive me?",
  "28493": "Was this not preventing any inquiry, and, at the same time, assuming a higher ground through this pretended fascination exercised over a man who must have been of warlike nature and accustomed to receive homage?",
  "28494": "For what end are her fair complexities, her changes of soil, her sinuous coast?",
  "28495": "What was to be done with them?",
  "28496": "What must I know?",
  "28497": "Is it good?",
  "28498": "Would you four stand up for a moment?",
  "28499": "Is it not on this order of release?",
  "28500": "And, still further, I am tempted to inquire what has become of the indigent scholars, the sons of the masses of the people whose daily labour just suffices to meet their daily wants, for whose benefit these rich foundations were largely, if not mainly, instituted?",
  "28501": "There is nothing in my house for you, do you hear?",
  "28502": "On what ground shall we persuade the contented egoist, who has but a handful of commonplace desires and finds it possible to satisfy most of them, that it is better to call into being a multitude of wants many of which will probably remain unrealized?",
  "28503": "Do you hear now?",
  "28504": "What fog?",
  "28505": "Who was there present?",
  "28506": "What interest, I say, what interest do you ask?",
  "28507": "Not sick, are you?",
  "28508": "But what if I were mistaken?",
  "28509": "Then do you yourself know?",
  "28510": "Why should you, of all people, be so passionate about it?",
  "28511": "Would YOU like cats if you were me?",
  "28512": "Fifty cents a pound, was it?",
  "28513": "Do you acknowledge your faults?",
  "28514": "How can its error, being universal, be capable of correction?",
  "28515": "What had fate in store for these daring adventurers?",
  "28516": "Who do these three cavaliers appear to you to be?",
  "28517": "How did you know?",
  "28518": "And how could I do that, unless so be I was there myself?",
  "28519": "Are you still intimate with her?",
  "28520": "Or I my brains?",
  "28521": "Has anyone assaulted you?",
  "28522": "Whose?",
  "28523": "Is it in vain our conquering arms subdue?",
  "28524": "That idea is your own, and yours solely?",
  "28525": "Why have you never told me?",
  "28526": "Where are you going now?",
  "28527": "You will not say it?",
  "28528": "What are we going to do?",
  "28529": "How about these papers?",
  "28530": "Will nobody say what is the matter?",
  "28531": "But why should I repine?",
  "28532": "I must be trembling, does it not show in my writing?",
  "28533": "How had it come to pass that matters which with others are so private, should with her have become the public property of so large a circle?",
  "28534": "Where is the man who can say the fault, in part, has not been his?",
  "28535": "You would allow, I said, that there is in nature an upper and lower and middle region?",
  "28536": "Well, and what do you think?",
  "28537": "Have we lost the power of rendering you happy?",
  "28538": "Why not, sire?",
  "28539": "Are you sure that you do not falter or fear?",
  "28540": "And what can we do there?",
  "28541": "Want money?",
  "28542": "You're not going to be silly about it, are you?",
  "28543": "And have you ever seen her by any chance?",
  "28544": "You have heard nothing to the contrary, have you?",
  "28545": "Did you find him, gossip?",
  "28546": "Is it all over?",
  "28547": "What's that, sir?",
  "28548": "That you fled from your husband?",
  "28549": "Remember where he said the book was?",
  "28550": "And now, when shall we meet again?",
  "28551": "Did I say anything that was inconsistent with his having seen it before?",
  "28552": "Iron what?",
  "28553": "Can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than laws can among friends?",
  "28554": "Why contend?",
  "28555": "But may not this inference be presumptuous?",
  "28556": "What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant?",
  "28557": "And how have you wriggled onto the staff?",
  "28558": "Counting from when?",
  "28559": "What's the matter, then?",
  "28560": "Does he know you are going to be married?",
  "28561": "Are they not lovely?",
  "28562": "What would you do, then?",
  "28563": "You remember, I was proclaimed four years ago?",
  "28564": "I suppose you'd be above sittin' down and 'avin' a bit of dinner with us?",
  "28565": "Was he bent, then, upon ruining me?",
  "28566": "Why scare people?",
  "28567": "Where am I to let you know to?",
  "28568": "Any fault there?",
  "28569": "Where did you get that donkey head?",
  "28570": "Was anybody here just now?",
  "28571": "From whom and what about?",
  "28572": "Barkis?",
  "28573": "Who would these be?",
  "28574": "Of her character?",
  "28575": "Like my father?",
  "28576": "Yes, and why did you go in?",
  "28577": "In which world?",
  "28578": "You have arms, I suppose?",
  "28579": "Where are you bound for?",
  "28580": "And of what kind of trees?",
  "28581": "Going to college, I suppose?",
  "28582": "What's gone of your father and your mother, eh?",
  "28583": "Do you suppose they'll ever dance together?",
  "28584": "Do they imagine at home that I am so inexpert in the theory of drama as not to know this?",
  "28585": "What did you cut it off for, then?",
  "28586": "Johnson?",
  "28587": "What good is it then for the ball to be thrown up, or harm for it to come down, or even to have fallen?",
  "28588": "But would it be so?",
  "28589": "Do you play much?",

  "28596": "Have you nothing to add?",
  "28597": "Does the straw bother you, mate?",
  "28598": "My footprint, I presume?",
  "28599": "Would you like it again?",
  "28600": "Where is he going?",
  "28601": "And what did you do in the matter, bishop?",
  "28602": "Give me what you took from me, will you?",
  "28603": "Are you going to marry him?",
  "28604": "But she's got her faults, you mean to say?",
  "28605": "Is he a good workman?",
  "28606": "Who might have done that, I wonder?",
  "28607": "How long do you remain here, prince?",
  "28608": "But did you never win?",
  "28609": "Since I've been away?",
  "28610": "Ruined?",

  "28617": "Do you see anything else?",
  "28618": "How could I after all the fuss?",

  "28633": "How shall I ever bring round to my adventurous views those whom I propose to desert?",
  "28634": "Did I have a father and mother?",
  "28635": "Do you remember me?",
  "28636": "But why do I thus torment myself?",
  "28637": "Where's the second boy?",
  "28638": "Are these lenses capable of resisting such pressure?",
  "28639": "How, then, could they catch it?",
  "28640": "A how much?",
  "28641": "We should, never quarrel, should we after we were used to each other?",
  "28642": "What do you want to say to me, my love?",
  "28643": "And how did it begin to be his?",

  "28646": "You mean the threat in her husband's letter?",
  "28647": "What will be the fairest way of considering the question?",
  "28648": "And if I prize so highly these two things, who could estimate the value of what remains?",
  "28649": "But was that all her reward?",

  "29553": "When do you think he WILL come?",
  "29554": "What should he do now?",
  "29555": "Was he withheld by regard for his word?",
  "29556": "And what's the price?",
  "29557": "You must have a ladder?",
  "29558": "Sir, are you at leisure for five minutes?",
  "29559": "Shall we go to him this morning?",
  "29560": "Did this mean we had to drop everything else and concentrate on armies and weapons ?",
  "29561": "Why should he be made so wretched?",
  "29562": "You here so late?",
  "29563": "You cannot take me with you?",
  "29564": "Who goes there?",
  "29565": "Why wage campaigns that send no laurels home?",
  "29566": "And have you heard?",
  "29567": "What's to hinder you from staying, except the widow woman or the young girls would inveigle you off?",
  "29568": "But, my dear, are fellows never to get livings?",
  "29569": "And what is better than jasper?",
  "29570": "Dolly, are you serious?",
  "29571": "How could he tell?",
  "29572": "Where from?",
  "29573": "How many?",
  "29574": "Was it not extraordinary?",
  "29575": "Why do you kiss the gentlewoman so?",
  "29576": "Could we sleep under the trees?",
  "29577": "Wentworth?",
  "29578": "And is this all?",
  "29579": "May I ask why?",
  "29580": "Do they never go to sleep?",
  "29581": "Gotta da peach?",
  "29582": "And what was he saying?",
  "29583": "But when were the hopes of humanity fulfilled?",
  "29584": "How did he do?",
  "29585": "What's your lay?",
  "29586": "Who at this court is so audacious as to wish to injure those whom the queen loves?",
  "29587": "Merciful heavens?",
  "29588": "Have you only just come?",
  "29589": "Over there, do you see, where the pools are?",
  "29590": "Let me ask you why you deceived me?",
  "29591": "Shall you keep it or send it back?",
  "29592": "To what do you refer?",
  "29593": "If there be no life in earth, how could life come out of it?",
  "29594": "Is the money, then, ready?",
  "29595": "Can you see them?",
  "29596": "Is there THREE of 'em then?",
  "29597": "Where do we go?",
  "29598": "Would he not one day make you pay for keeping this terrible secret?",
  "29599": "Will there ever be an end to these fooleries?",
  "29600": "But, then, why should he smile so kindly upon you?",
  "29601": "What misfortune?",
  "29602": "How could I wish to make anything hard to you either by my words or conduct?",
  "29603": "What was the meaning of this?",
  "29604": "Would he never come back?",
  "29605": "Are you staying at the flat?",
  "29606": "How could I be expected to know?",
  "29607": "Have you chased them away, too?",
  "29608": "Is he one of your men?",
  "29609": "Everything?",
  "29610": "What have you been doing?",
  "29611": "After all, what could it matter to her whether he were here or there, on this ship or another, ashore or not?",
  "29612": "Are you not near me?",
  "29613": "It is not your business, is it?",
  "29614": "In three days?",
  "29615": "Well then, do you think I am awake?",
  "29616": "Is she ill, or only famished?",
  "29617": "Have you any more notions?",
  "29618": "You are not well?",
  "29619": "Cohan?",
  "29620": "Has he committed a sin?",
  "29621": "Do you want to see it?",
  "29622": "You are still with us, I presume?",
  "29623": "And where is he gone to?",
  "29624": "What means had been employed to kidnap this innocent creature, and with what object?",
  "29625": "How can I hope to save her?",
  "29626": "What is't you do?",
  "29627": "What was?",
  "29628": "Well, will you go?",
  "29629": "And your grandparents?",
  "29630": "What, that child?",
  "29631": "I suppose you would hardly know me again now I've got a pair of whiskers?",
  "29632": "Your wife?",
  "29633": "If he be ever so improper, how can I help his having written to me?",
  "29634": "What jars to our preconceptions will he and I receive here?",
  "29635": "How could there be any good in a woman that everybody spoke ill of?",
  "29636": "What call shall I send?",
  "29637": "How do you name yourself?",
  "29638": "Did you understand that sign?",
  "29639": "Will you come in?",
  "29640": "Cost?",
  "29641": "Why, man, what are you talking about?",
  "29642": "But do you know where?",
  "29643": "Was it because she was bareheaded, was it merely her natural expression?",
  "29644": "Have you shadowed her?",
  "29645": "Will you come back?",
  "29646": "And what else can he be after?",
  "29647": "Then how do you come to be going there?",
  "29648": "Well, if war is a terrible thing, what about patriotism, which is the idea at the base of it?",
  "29649": "Does it please your honor that I should accompany you?",
  "29650": "Why, is not here your cloak?",
  "29651": "Are all the cranes and pulleys sure?",
  "29652": "She is in prison?",
  "29653": "But there is nothing comforting in having your hair cut off because you've dyed it a dreadful color, is there?",
  "29654": "It is not like her, you say?",
  "29655": "And who is he?",
  "29656": "What letter is it?",
  "29657": "And you, what the devil do you want here?",
  "29658": "Suppose we have a little game of euchre?",
  "29659": "What does it all mean?",
  "29660": "But when you leave him, for instance?",
  "29661": "Only slightly touched?",
  "29662": "Was it for so petty a thing that he had done all that he had done?",
  "29663": "Perhaps this incident was connected with that of the bullet?",
  "29664": "Conway, what are you going to do?",
  "29665": "Are limes the fashion now?",
  "29666": "Rebecca, may I give you a wing?",
  "29667": "What were the defects of this remarkable man?",
  "29668": "But how were we to get him into his clothes again?",
  "29669": "I hope I was not the trouble, guardian?",
  "29670": "Where is beauty?",
  "29671": "Where has he gone?",
  "29672": "Well, then, how if we were to begin with oysters, and so change the whole program?",
  "29673": "The face he pulled?",
  "29674": "Can they govern a family, or take care of the poor babes whom they bring into the world?",
  "29675": "Is it, then, stretching our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the occasion of the change?",
  "29676": "Neither gold nor rank?",
  "29677": "But was he alone or accompanied?",
  "29678": "WHY, you dear delightful woman, did you like it?",
  "29679": "Who is knocking?",
  "29680": "How can you speak of it in that way?",
  "29681": "Do you mean that we are going to die too?",
  "29682": "Why not stay here now and be quiet?",
  "29683": "You have since reflected?",
  "29684": "Do you think your hotel man will open his hotel this month?",
  "29685": "Is that all, gentlemen?",
  "29686": "Why should you be inconvenienced?",
  "29687": "Thed what are you?",
  "29688": "Did anyone ever hear the like?",
  "29689": "Is there too much vanity in what I have just said?",
  "29690": "What is that?",
  "29691": "You would not marry him, now that he is free?",
  "29692": "And the unjust is good and wise, and the just is neither?",
  "29693": "Who wrote it?",
  "29694": "Now, was that somebody brother to the prisoner at the bar?",
  "29695": "Well, does the colonel treat you well?",
  "29696": "How long are we to endure it?",
  "29697": "What is it that I manage?",
  "29698": "You made paper, pens and ink?",
  "29699": "But why talk now?",
  "29700": "Is it a renewal of the former proposition or what?",
  "29701": "But what to do?",
  "29702": "Shall we charge them or no?",
  "29703": "Why should I tire you with particulars of my consequence?",
  "29704": "Then why do you apply to me?",
  "29705": "And have they appointed the matron?",
  "29706": "And why not?",
  "29707": "Has a girl of fourteen a heart large enough, vigorous enough, to hold the swelling spring of pure, full, fervid eloquence?",
  "29708": "I understand you to say that there are three students who use this stair, and are in the habit of passing your door?",
  "29709": "Our neighbor?",
  "29710": "Where would they meet?",
  "29711": "How was it I noticed nothing?",
  "29712": "Where are you going, bandit?",
  "29713": "You do not doubt his affection?",
  "29714": "What orders?",
  "29715": "Can you walk?",
  "29716": "If he had been positively in earnest, with downright manly earnestness, would he have allowed the thing to drag itself with a weak uncertain life, as it had done for the last two or three years?",
  "29717": "Even allowing that she does not love him, that she pays no heed to her vows and promises, how can she give herself to another man?",
  "29718": "Who gave her away?",
  "29719": "To what had he brought himself?",
  "29720": "What can be done for it?",
  "29721": "Is everything as it should be?",
  "29722": "I trust he does not suffer?",
  "29723": "How do you mean, the general?",
  "29724": "And how many hours a day did you do lessons?",
  "29725": "Is it a very wicked place?",
  "29726": "Why had our incomprehensible guide led us to the bottom of this submarine crypt?",
  "29727": "What are you doing tonight?",
  "29728": "Will you take me away with you?",
  "29729": "I hope we are not to part as enemies?",
  "29730": "Ah, dear sister, how can I answer this question?",
  "29731": "Why will you think so?",
  "29732": "What could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as it dropped on her work?",
  "29733": "Do you mean me, sir?",
  "29734": "Did he not pretend to go back to his tribe, who had treated him ill, and driven him from their wigwams like a dog?",
  "29735": "But how can we find the way in this fog?",
  "29736": "In a decadent society, to come nearer to the problems which concern us in ethics, must a man strive to realize the social will expressed in progressive decadence?",
  "29737": "Had he noticed that the days had been only six hours long, and that the weight of the atmosphere was so much diminished?",
  "29738": "What was the man doing when you saw him?",
  "29739": "What does all this knowing mean to me?",
  "29740": "Might not that person by patient waiting be covering silent preparation, and proving his fitness for the glorious task before him?",
  "29741": "But what if it's worse than this?",
  "29742": "Not HE?",
  "29743": "Do I try and catch them?",
  "29744": "Still inquisitive?",
  "29745": "Is it my fault if fortune, which has frowned on you, has been kind to me?",
  "29746": "You haf not got something to drink, hey?",
  "29747": "Yes, dear?",
  "29748": "Art shod with lead?",
  "29749": "Wherein have I hurt you?",
  "29750": "Will our help come from you?",
  "29751": "How should there be eighteen copies, all different from the original, and from one another, in minor matters?",
  "29752": "In the meantime, who can foretell what would be the sufferings and privations of the people during its existence?",
  "29753": "What is it, grandmother?",
  "29754": "If we could get a drink?",
  "29755": "Is it not the duty of the nations to combine and to relieve suffering humanity?",
  "29756": "Then that is not the knowledge which we are seeking to discover?",
  "29757": "You met a monk, did you not?",
  "29758": "Can I not read your heart?",
  "29759": "Now, then, the difference between property and possession being well established, and it being settled that the former, for the reasons which I have just given, must necessarily disappear, is it best, for the slight advantage of restoring an etymology, to retain the word PROPERTY?",
  "29760": "What, it seems I do not drink but by an attorney?",
  "29761": "What was the cause of this flaw?",
  "29762": "Shall I give her?",
  "29763": "Was it right to be frightened already?",
  "29764": "At what hour would you wish the ceremony performed?",
  "29765": "Do you mean a compliment?",
  "29766": "Do you not know that there is a spirit within you different from flesh?",
  "29767": "In this painful moment can the best of fathers wish to destroy my domestic happiness, the only kind which now remains to me?",
  "29768": "What struggle was going on within him?",
  "29769": "So that he still expects his money?",
  "29770": "What will become of us if she dies, as I always fear when her face is like that?",
  "29771": "And if not, is he a devil?",
  "29772": "You your command, and I my title?",
  "29773": "Why has she not written to me, then?",
  "29774": "By this train?",
  "29775": "Are they good to eat?",
  "29776": "Will we trample again upon that torn and mangled corpse?",
  "29777": "And who can wonder if it be so, mother?",
  "29778": "Are you comfortable now, sir?",
  "29779": "Swear it was not true?",
  "29780": "What good was moral support in providing a million and a half?",
  "29781": "But can you restore him back to life?",
  "29782": "I hope you're well?",
  "29783": "Did he designedly conceal some incident of his captivity?",
  "29784": "You remember that young fellow mother wanted me to have?",
  "29785": "So there are fashions, nowadays, in illness, are there?",
  "29786": "Then, sir, you are a favourite, I find, among the ladies?",
  "29787": "Do he rave about his mother just the same, poor fellow?",
  "29788": "Where is it?",
  "29789": "Yours then are rather here?",
  "29790": "Are you in a position to quit the post of superintendent at this moment?",
  "29791": "Do you observe anything remarkable about that?",
  "29792": "How was this to be done?",
  "29793": "Have you never heard talk of a certain secret?",
  "29794": "Did he come here voluntarily?",
  "29795": "What do you really think of her?",
  "29796": "When did he give it you?",
  "29797": "Unintentionally?",
  "29798": "Harry?",
  "29799": "Am I to come home?",
  "29800": "Now if this tenderness for the dead is such an exercise of these three theological virtues, and if, again, even heroic sanctity consists principally in their exercise, what store ought we not to set upon this touching and beautiful devotion?",
  "29801": "And the result of the examination?",
  "29802": "His ELDER brother?",
  "29803": "Perhaps he was expected to utter certain words?",
  "29804": "Supposing he is loyal, can any of his requests be granted, and if any, which of them?",
  "29805": "Are you sure you are more reasonable?",
  "29806": "Shall I go in first?",
  "29807": "What will you warm yourself with this winter?",
  "29808": "How is it they come to you?",
  "29809": "What have you got there?",
  "29810": "Have you your carriage?",
  "29811": "Do you think that you will catch anything?",
  "29812": "What is she lying down for?",
  "29813": "Who said she knew him?",
  "29814": "How do you find yourself this morning, sir?",
  "29815": "And what would you call this?",
  "29816": "How think you of that?",
  "29817": "Does she?",
  "29818": "What is that water?",
  "29819": "Going on?",
  "29820": "What palace may it deck?",
  "29821": "Reversed?",
  "29822": "Are you going to sit down, or are you not?",
  "29823": "Were you ever there?",
  "29824": "Do you see what a villain he is?",
  "29825": "And yet, when I was at my father's, did not the men give up their gayest balls and parties in order to pass the evening with me?",
  "29826": "But I want to know why the word 'moor' should have been written?",
  "29827": "We sent you wine?",
  "29828": "When did you get the letter?",
  "29829": "What is indispensable to you?",
  "29830": "What have I said?",
  "29831": "But how could you be sure I would know it?",
  "29832": "Tell me, I entreat of you, who and what you are?",
  "29833": "Had he not seduced his sisters, one after the other?",
  "29834": "Might I speak to you with regard to that matter of his grace, sir?",
  "29835": "Must I close this?",
  "29836": "The world is surely not worth living in now, is it?",
  "29837": "And was this the man?",
  "29838": "What's the time?",
  "29839": "What's queer?",
  "29840": "What house will they take?",
  "29841": "May the man who denies it rest his assertion upon such general considerations as that satisfaction presupposes desire, and that desire implies a lack, and, hence, pain?",
  "29842": "Was it well?",
  "29843": "Could it be done?",
  "29844": "Why should I stand in a comrade's way?",
  "29845": "What have you done with that gentleman against whom you had the audacity, about twelve days ago, to make an accusation of passing false money?",
  "29846": "What else should I stay on for?",
  "29847": "What beings surround me?",
  "29848": "What judgment?",
  "29849": "How could I offend a man who was charitable enough to sit at my bedside a good hour, and talk on some other subject than pills and draughts, blisters and leeches?",
  "29850": "D'Epinay?",
  "29851": "Are you certain of what you say, monsieur?",
  "29852": "And the reason is that each part of him is doing its own business, whether in ruling or being ruled?",
  "29853": "You want it, I expect?",
  "29854": "Had he been fooled once more?",
  "29855": "Do you seriously believe that that machine has travelled into time?",
  "29856": "What says our graver sister?",
  "29857": "But when these different reflections and observations concur in establishing the same conclusion, must they not bestow an undisputed evidence upon it?",
  "29858": "Can I do anything?",
  "29859": "What passage is that?",
  "29860": "But does she now dissolve the union?",
  "29861": "Any way out of that yard, now?",
  "29862": "Have those who have had their share in oligarchies been peculiarly wise and peculiarly devoted to the common good?",
  "29863": "What was there to be done in the village?",
  "29864": "What should I tell?",
  "29865": "Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad?",
  "29866": "To what purpose?",
  "29867": "And if it is labor that creates wealth and legitimates property, how explain the consumption of the idler?",
  "29868": "What did you mean by that?",
  "29869": "Well, what do YOU make of it?",
  "29870": "Are there any?",
  "29871": "And if I refuse to retract, you wish to fight, do you?",
  "29872": "Dora, what has happened to you?",
  "29873": "Where have you been sleeping all this week?",
  "29874": "But what do you gather from it?",
  "29875": "Then how could you know?",
  "29876": "Are you much hurt?",
  "29877": "Daunted?",
  "29878": "And why should you try to deceive me by telling a tale?",
  "29879": "Can I come, with my doll?",
  "29880": "Yes my boy?",
  "29881": "Had it not been for this utter stranger, they had succeeded, for who would have accepted my unsupported word against the damning evidence of those cards hidden on my person?",
  "29882": "Why this man saved and that man lost?",
  "29883": "How has my judgment wander'd?",
  "29884": "And is not all true virtue the companion of wisdom, no matter what fears or pleasures or other similar goods or evils may or may not attend her?",
  "29885": "You know what I mean?",
  "29886": "What, sweetheart?",
  "29887": "What sort of a place is it?",
  "29888": "Well, I vow, that's what the sea folks call sailing UNDER BARE POLES, come true, aint it?",
  "29889": "Who took his hands out of mine?",
  "29890": "I insist upon your living, do you hear?",
  "29891": "Why on earth did you ask him to dine with us?",
  "29892": "Was she sheering off?",
  "29893": "What say your old men?",
  "29894": "Are not the quail, the pigeon and the partridge the natural prey of the hawk?",
  "29895": "From the country, I see, sir?",
  "29896": "Would prudence or gratitude allow the pontiffs to renounce their benefactor?",
  "29897": "Why must their ruffs be always crinkled like endive leaves, and not crimped with a crimping iron?",
  "29898": "To whom is it they should have recourse?",
  "29899": "But who is there that ever heard of such an instinct?",
  "29900": "Well, but what am I to do?",
  "29901": "Subdivide?",
  "29902": "What is the colour of the men?",
  "29903": "What's the pay?",
  "29904": "Because I sigh when thinking of some one I am leaving?",
  "29905": "Whom did you play with?",
  "29906": "Do they work worse?",
  "29907": "You're not worried about anything?",
  "29908": "Are you sure you know the way?",
  "29909": "Why not make him a doctor like his father?",
  "29910": "But what was that to her, or to any one but myself?",
  "29911": "A little fancy work?",
  "29912": "Then again, if a woman and her lover conspire to murder a husband, are they going to advertise their guilt by ostentatiously removing his wedding ring after his death?",
  "29913": "Where are you off to?",
  "29914": "What's set you a snivelling now?",
  "29915": "And who is to do the parish work?",
  "29916": "Are you well fed?",
  "29917": "How many years do you mean to live after I am gone?",
  "29918": "What could these people do?",
  "29919": "Do you think I would leave you?",
  "29920": "And what do you call all this?",
  "29921": "Is it anything bad?",
  "29922": "Is it of course?",
  "29923": "But now what?",
  "29924": "Where is it?",
  "29925": "Would these two travellers make much difference to the horses, if we took them with us?",
  "29926": "Shall we not bear the trials of life a little longer in patience?",
  "29927": "How can they recognize you, if you act in such a manner that no one can recognize you?",
  "29928": "What is it you smell of?",
  "29929": "Forgotten, indeed?",
  "29930": "Were you at the performance last evening?",
  "29931": "How have you got on?",
  "29932": "Paying the money, I suppose?",
  "29933": "May one venture to ask you, monsieur, on what you have reflected?",
  "29934": "Are you, then, a coward?",
  "29935": "Would it not be safer and more certain if I should ask him his name and tell him yours?",
  "29936": "Why, how did he come here, mother?",
  "29937": "Why do you say that, when you are going to this terrible war, and he is so old?",
  "29938": "Under what law, and for what offence?",
  "29939": "Easily?",
  "29940": "Why did he not take her in his arms and swear that he would never leave her?",
  "29941": "DID you hear that?",
  "29942": "Is the committee willing to hear this witness?",
  "29943": "Would you care for it?",
  "29944": "Who will be waiting for me beyond the ditch?",
  "29945": "May I?",
  "29946": "What is the stone called?",
  "29947": "Now, sir, tell me who and what that woman was?",
  "29948": "Are you one?",
  "29949": "Married?",
  "29950": "Will that do now?",
  "29951": "How shall I put it on?",
  "29952": "And to what purpose?",
  "29953": "Mouston?",
  "29954": "How is your dear mother getting on?",
  "29955": "Why did we choose it, this foolish task?",
  "29956": "Are you an alienist?",
  "29957": "Cannot ate it?",
  "29958": "You are, I imagine, still of the same opinion?",
  "29959": "Or not you so much, perhaps, as your friend in the city?",
  "29960": "Did you ask her how much?",
  "29961": "Is there no force on this side of the creek?",
  "29962": "If I guess rightly, will you confess it?",
  "29963": "Did you ever hear a definition of fame, sir?",
  "29964": "Ay, but how shall we know the catchpole?",
  "29965": "What harm is there in that?",
  "29966": "Why are there men and women that while they are nigh me the sunlight expands my blood?",
  "29967": "Why, according to popular belief is it rather characterised by the very contrary?",
  "29968": "Shall we hold it as a province and govern it by despotic power?",
  "29969": "My dear doctor, what is my wife's complaint?",
  "29970": "Do we go all the way today?",
  "29971": "Oh, what does that matter?",
  "29972": "What place was there in her mind for a remonstrance to lodge in?",
  "29973": "Really and truly?",
  "29974": "If that were so, what had become of my father?",
  "29975": "But where is the last year's snow?",
  "29976": "How much will you ask to stay with her till the end?",
  "29977": "Can the heart become misshapen and contract incurable deformities and infirmities under the oppression of a disproportionate unhappiness, as the vertebral column beneath too low a vault?",
  "29978": "What can it be?",
  "29979": "Of whom are you jealous, now?",
  "29980": "What was the sense of that?",
  "29981": "I felt very ignorant, but what could I do?",
  "29982": "And what are you going to do with yourself now, if I may ask?",
  "29983": "What interest of hers was affected by the treaty?",
  "29984": "An order to who?",
  "29985": "Which is the stronger, the small stick that first PRODUCES the fire, or the fire itself?",
  "29986": "So you've been at the club?",
  "29987": "Has he been a good soldier except the desertion?",
  "29988": "Do you think not?",
  "29989": "What you mought call me?",
  "29990": "Full of hope?",
  "29991": "And who will go?",
  "29992": "Farther?",
  "29993": "Should he slip away after having come and peeped into the barricade?",
  "29994": "Perhaps?",
  "29995": "Very well, my dear sir, and how does that concern us?",
  "29996": "But will the wild ass submit to the bonds?",
  "29997": "Where is the count?",
  "29998": "A whole one, and in a candlestick?",
  "29999": "Are you?",
  "30000": "Are you going to remain as you are, dear princess?",
  "30001": "What might have been your opinion of the place?",
  "30002": "Who defeated it?",
  "30003": "Plantation hand?",
  "30004": "For us, also?",
  "30005": "What is to be done with them?",
  "30006": "What would the life of a man be if he could feel no fear or repulsion?",
  "30007": "Is it really so that I may understand you, sir?",
  "30008": "Well, dad, what do you say about it?",
  "30009": "Why did she love everything so tenderly and so passionately, everything living that was not a man?",
  "30010": "In favor of some member of your family?",
  "30011": "You are angry, monsieur?",
  "30012": "What, he told you so, I suppose?",
  "30013": "What, have they buried him in honour for his services to them?",
  "30014": "To stand from fear set free?",
  "30015": "You are aware, I suppose, that all mythology and poetry is a narration of events, either past, present, or to come?",
  "30016": "Why do you go, sir?",
  "30017": "You called my father 'Michael' as if you knew him well?",
  "30018": "This DETOUR has been entirely for our benefit, then?",
  "30019": "What do you tell me?",
  "30020": "What was she like now?",
  "30021": "Call the captain, and heave the ship aback?",
  "30022": "And did you observe any change in her then?",
  "30023": "Flee alone, and leave you here?",
  "30024": "Can I have lost it?",
  "30025": "Are the sacrifices I have made of honour and modesty to you no proof of my being tied to you in bonds too strong to be broken?",
  "30026": "But what makes you so much out of sorts?",
  "30027": "Why, wherefore stay you?",
  "30028": "Who asked him while I was away?",
  "30029": "Jarndyce?",
  "30030": "Why, what's the matter?",
  "30031": "What does it depend upon?",
  "30032": "Now will you learn not to answer back when I speak to you?",
  "30033": "And what you think of it?",
  "30034": "But, on the other hand, did not the people evince decided obstinacy and insubordination?",
  "30035": "And my making it easy for you to see the child?",
  "30036": "Has anyone an interest in preventing your arrival there?",
  "30037": "Do you abuse your teacher?",
  "30038": "Has it struck you that we may not now choose to give over?",
  "30039": "And how do you like the place?",
  "30040": "Why do you not sit by his side and begin talking to him and asking him questions?",
  "30041": "What have you got to be afraid of?",
  "30042": "What used he to say?",
  "30043": "Where the devil is mine?",
  "30044": "How do you feel yourself?",
  "30045": "That millions of others still exist, which are too minute for any observation?",
  "30046": "I suppose we might call her that?",
  "30047": "What's that to me?",
  "30048": "But you are sure you can act your part, and disguise your voice so that he may mistake that, as he has already mistaken your person?",
  "30049": "What would it matter if you smashed to smithereens at the end of the run, after a bust like that?",
  "30050": "Can someone have guessed our secret and dug up the watch?",
  "30051": "But what could he do but just let her see that he would make anything, everything, for her, as honourably easy as possible?",
  "30052": "How many cartridges did you say you had left?",
  "30053": "What then is worth being valued?",
  "30054": "What does this avail?",
  "30055": "This, then, was his father's residence?",
  "30056": "Fisher?",
  "30057": "How like you that answer?",
  "30058": "But what shall we do?",
  "30059": "If it is a friend, why does he not show himself?",
  "30060": "Who then must decide?",
  "30061": "Can we with propriety suffer them to be rulers?",
  "30062": "Have you been here long?",
  "30063": "How can they suit each other?",
  "30064": "Do you see these?",
  "30065": "How do you prove that?",
  "30066": "Arsenic?",
  "30067": "Now, sir, what have you to say to me?",
  "30068": "I suppose we're going to have a talk about this?",
  "30069": "Let 'em both wait?",
  "30070": "Perhaps you would not mind walking to town with me?",
  "30071": "Love had bandaged his eyes, in order to lead him whither?",
  "30072": "It is not my intention to detain the reader by expa?",
  "30073": "Why ask?",
  "30074": "Am I to read this?",
  "30075": "Who are you then?",
  "30076": "Was there nothing to fear?",
  "30077": "But did this man hope to conceal himself effectually behind that heap of rubbish, which one need but skirt?",
  "30078": "Then it all depends on that object that you regard, for your reasons, as evidence?",
  "30079": "What if there was no rank of life in which she could now properly attach herself?",
  "30080": "Why then do philosophers look for public spirit?",
  "30081": "How many would he have?",
  "30082": "But do you know this mysterious count is a bachelor?",
  "30083": "Why strive for a coherent, satisfied life?",
  "30084": "Intelligent you call yourselves, do you?",
  "30085": "Did men eat men?",
  "30086": "That is, he was not a boy at all, I suppose?",
  "30087": "Who knew what would have saved him?",
  "30088": "Could he not annul the verdict?",
  "30089": "How can something come out of nothing?",
  "30090": "And now, he said, what did we just now call that principle which repels the even?",
  "30091": "What is that error?",
  "30092": "I hurriedly made him a reply to the effect, that I hoped the error into which I had been betrayed by the desperate nature of my love, did not induce him to think me mercenary too?",
  "30093": "What is this place?",
  "30094": "Guy, is this amount of confidence to be our stock to start the new life on?",
  "30095": "How is your head, better?",
  "30096": "What matters that?",
  "30097": "The opportunity is a good one, then?",
  "30098": "But if, in spite of all my precautions, I am at last obliged to fight, will you not be my second?",
  "30099": "May I ask you to be so kind as to inquire of all your subjects if any of them have seen a fishing hook lost in the sea?",
  "30100": "And what is your business?",
  "30101": "Had I better wait till it's three o'clock?",
  "30102": "Why are you not eating anything, gentlemen?",
  "30103": "Does this not amount to your stealing the annual salary from your lord?",
  "30104": "Who'd you reckon?",
  "30105": "WILL IT BE COMMUNISM?",
  "30106": "Are you a married man, sir?",
  "30107": "What dream we of?",
  "30108": "What's the good of taking it in hand now?",
  "30109": "But if he does not come?",
  "30110": "Have you any idea what became of them?",
  "30111": "And why this ABSOLUTISM in the relations of capitalist and laborer?",
  "30112": "Is any man termed a gentleman, that is not always in the fashion?",
  "30113": "Do I ever leave you?",
  "30114": "Are you all of the same opinion?",
  "30115": "Whose was this mighty personality?",
  "30116": "Perhaps you could name the figures of a few wiolincellers of a good tone?",
  "30117": "To marrying whom?",
  "30118": "Am I wrong to come up here to see her?",
  "30119": "You heard my question?",
  "30120": "Why now should I be tempted?",
  "30121": "Where's my maid?",
  "30122": "You're able to read?",
  "30123": "What has he lived on since?",
  "30124": "And you resent it?",
  "30125": "Kennedy was preparing to discharge all his batteries into the middle of the ascending multitude, but what could he have done against such a numberless army?",
  "30126": "Was it not rather a service and a kindly act?",
  "30127": "How could there be when it's barely ten o'clock yet?",
  "30128": "And have you got a paper?",
  "30129": "Where is the girl who promised to marry any one who would release her brother?",
  "30130": "And all arithmetic and calculation have to do with number?",
  "30131": "How do you happen to be here?",
  "30132": "And what is the result?",
  "30133": "And for what have you ruined your life, if you come to think of it?",
  "30134": "Who talks of cadeaux?",
  "30135": "But did you not read that I must be alone?",
  "30136": "Do you find the prisoner guilty or not guilty?",
  "30137": "And he who does not possess and is therefore unable to impart this conception, in whatever degree he fails, may in that degree also be said to fail in intelligence?",
  "30138": "But what's happened to you?",
  "30139": "Are you lost or have the wolves eaten you?",
  "30140": "Why should I still be subject to these visitations of the devil, when I try so hard to keep him away?",
  "30141": "How do you know what I think?",
  "30142": "But why was the tear in her eye?",
  "30143": "Are you lonesome because you're a magician?",
  "30144": "What had taken place during those ten months?",
  "30145": "You accuse him, then?",
  "30146": "What has anybody to do with that?",
  "30147": "Was I wrong in claiming that confusion reigned among legists, and ought I to be legally prosecuted for having said that their science henceforth stood convicted of falsehood, its glory eclipsed?",
  "30148": "John, which way must we now turn?",
  "30149": "Was I not right?",
  "30150": "Why so breathless a start?",
  "30151": "And have we, at our age, been earnestly discoursing with one another all our life long only to discover that we are no better than children?",
  "30152": "Do you want to go with us?",
  "30153": "Who had taken the letters, if letters there were?",
  "30154": "At any rate, they are all reconciled to it now, I hope?",
  "30155": "And they will place them under the command of experienced veterans who will be their leaders and teachers?",
  "30156": "Even the spiritual vision, is it not at all points arrested by the continuous golden walls of the universe?",
  "30157": "What can you be dreaming of?",
  "30158": "You say again you are quite sure that it was the prisoner?",
  "30159": "Is it any new trouble?",
  "30160": "And talking about the hospital?",
  "30161": "Amid what elegancies of carved furniture, decorated walls, elaborate tapestries did they move?",
  "30162": "If they are really qualified for the task, will not their own hearts be the first to inform them of it?",
  "30163": "What sort of life were that to live?",
  "30164": "What's your trade?",
  "30165": "How could I have been so beguiled?",
  "30166": "How does I talk wild?",
  "30167": "Would we be done for?",
  "30168": "Come, now, my learned friend, what makes you hesitate?",
  "30169": "You have come far?",
  "30170": "But is she not awfully rich?",
  "30171": "Who can make good coffee?",
  "30172": "So we had better leave you?",
  "30173": "Is the downstairs door fast?",
  "30174": "Or if he is to be governed, how can he be governed well?",
  "30175": "Will you have tea here then, or go across to the house, where there's a tent on the lawn?",
  "30176": "Did you observe the colour?",
  "30177": "Can it be?",
  "30178": "Will this assist in explaining the difficulty?",
  "30179": "Is not my son hungry?",
  "30180": "You are sure of your enterprise?",
  "30181": "Have you been at the concert?",
  "30182": "What about her horse?",
  "30183": "Mamma, what am I to say to him?",
  "30184": "When is your turn to come?",
  "30185": "Had I thus come in vain into these forests and mountains?",
  "30186": "Do you call that nothing?",
  "30187": "What is it, then, which does judge about them?",
  "30188": "Shall I lend you a hand here?",
  "30189": "Damn you, what do you mean by that?",
  "30190": "And who's that tall chap standing beside her?",
  "30191": "Would any one deny this?",
  "30192": "Did they impose on each industry a proportional tax, so as to preserve a balance in the market?",
  "30193": "What should you do in my place?",
  "30194": "What more could one ask for?",
  "30195": "For who can change men's opinions?",
  "30196": "Would a painter be any the worse because, after having delineated with consummate art an ideal of a perfectly beautiful man, he was unable to show that any such man could ever have existed?",
  "30197": "Have you decided?",
  "30198": "How is your father getting on?",
  "30199": "Were those great, stony cliffs the gates of paradise?",
  "30200": "Shall our rivers and harbors be improved?",
  "30201": "But how do you make it shine through the walls?",
  "30202": "What, do you want to leave us?",
  "30203": "Do you stand me out, mistress?",
  "30204": "How is the poor woman?",
  "30205": "Or, that she should prefer the rant of flattery to the simple accents of sincerity?",
  "30206": "Are you a gentleman?",
  "30207": "Did you speak?",
  "30208": "Shall I see you again before your departure?",
  "30209": "And how are the other people getting on?",
  "30210": "Why should I not go?",
  "30211": "And if they are not fortifying, sire?",
  "30212": "But hark, what music is that?",
  "30213": "What do you suppose they would do to a man disarmed like me?",
  "30214": "Are you really frightened, madame?",
  "30215": "What are you doing, you stupid creature?",
  "30216": "Who will undertake it, if it be not also a service of honour?",
  "30217": "What have you heard?",
  "30218": "But as for me, what solace had I when the days of my fighting were done?",
  "30219": "You were not unfortunate, and yet you are an orphan, fatherless and motherless?",
  "30220": "Would not that have been better evidence?",
  "30221": "Where was my head when I made that grant?",
  "30222": "How will she take it?",
  "30223": "And you order me to announce you to the duchess?",
  "30224": "What more has happened?",
  "30225": "Why did you not tell me, instead of teasing me like this?",
  "30226": "Judah told you?",
  "30227": "So far we are within the bounds of possibility, are we not?",
  "30228": "Will the train soon be in?",
  "30229": "What is your opinion?",
  "30230": "How was it, having so little in reality to conceal, that I always DID feel as if this man were finding me out?",
  "30231": "What I wanted, who can say?",
  "30232": "And pray how do I and these my friends around me seem to you?",
  "30233": "Ah, are you composing poetry, queen?",
  "30234": "What is the use of being exquisite if you are not seen by the best judges?",
  "30235": "Then what was the use of our coming?",
  "30236": "Why do you disappoint me so?",
  "30237": "Are you a child or a teetotum?",
  "30238": "Take head?",
  "30239": "The date?",
  "30240": "Would I do him this favour?",
  "30241": "Do you mind if I go in and tell this man to come on to us when he's finished here?",
  "30242": "Is it in this particular part, or in that other?",
  "30243": "Are you ready to get back the trade on those terms?",
  "30244": "To what does your ambition aspire?",
  "30245": "And all complaining, accusing?",
  "30246": "Is she like me?",
  "30247": "What, none of you?",
  "30248": "You will fulfill your promise to me?",
  "30249": "What sort of animal is this interest?",
  "30250": "You must have known that?",
  "30251": "Was it not I?",
  "30252": "And am I dishonest?",
  "30253": "What's the letter?",
  "30254": "Would it please you to accompany her upon the lake?",
  "30255": "Ladies and gentlemen, what is your opinion on the subject?",
  "30256": "What do you want, sir?",
  "30257": "And where can a man seek ends of any sort beyond this broad field?",
  "30258": "How came you to make such a mistake as this?",
  "30259": "Is it too late?",
  "30260": "How do you feel now?",
  "30261": "Anne, did YOU put sugar in these peas?",
  "30262": "That is to say, justice is useful when money is useless?",
  "30263": "Is not this second infinite, so to speak, subjacent to the first?",
  "30264": "And he said nothing as he died?",
  "30265": "WHO forbade you?",
  "30266": "Gallia out of place?",
  "30267": "And am I not ready to do so again?",
  "30268": "Frightened of what?",
  "30269": "Where do we go first?",
  "30270": "Where are you?",
  "30271": "How did you get yourself into this mess?",
  "30272": "It is not in your possession?",
  "30273": "Will your excellency give your name, or remain incognito?",
  "30274": "Legal proceedings to prevent payment?",
  "30275": "Have you any sort of conveyance?",
  "30276": "I suppose you kissed his hand?",
  "30277": "What's in it?",
  "30278": "How dare you look into this garden?",
  "30279": "How find a straight road of progress, you men of science, of industry, of cooperation, of trades unions, and all the rest?",
  "30280": "Really?",
  "30281": "Is this gentle and lovely being lost forever?",
  "30282": "Weigh out tragedy, like butcher's meat?",
  "30283": "Happy?",
  "30284": "What mingles in the strain?",
  "30285": "What can that be, monsieur le chevalier?",
  "30286": "Why do you seek me?",
  "30287": "What, to buy gingerbread?",
  "30288": "Have the fugitives been pursued?",
  "30289": "Is he likely to marry, uncle?",
  "30290": "Not even a sou?",
  "30291": "What did he want?",
  "30292": "Of course it is very different here, but who knows how long it will last?",
  "30293": "Do you ever try to read your own face?",
  "30294": "No accident has happened to him?",
  "30295": "What have you to do with us?",
  "30296": "What's his name?",
  "30297": "Why, then, I would ask, do we see these lengthened shadows, which follow in the course of our political day?",
  "30298": "And how are they all?",
  "30299": "Larrey?",
  "30300": "Is this his house?",
  "30301": "Who is the man that seeks another man?",
  "30302": "Why, do you smoke?",
  "30303": "Will you have it now?",
  "30304": "When shall we get away?",
  "30305": "Good gracious, what's that?",
  "30306": "Have you been there?",
  "30307": "But why have you come the back way?",
  "30308": "What would you like to have?",
  "30309": "But does the painter know the right form of the bit and reins?",
  "30310": "Indeed?",
  "30311": "Why this jealousy of our advancement?",
  "30312": "With HER?",
  "30313": "And what is justice?",
  "30314": "But how if you and I had married legally, as we were on the point of doing?",
  "30315": "What millions, father?",
  "30316": "WHEREFORE IS LIGHT GIVEN TO HIM THAT IS IN MISERY, AND LIFE UNTO THE BITTER IN SOUL?",
  "30317": "Married him?",
  "30318": "How 't happens?",
  "30319": "Why these splendid buskins?",
  "30320": "Better than what?",
  "30321": "And may I escape by the door, sir, when I have opened it?",
  "30322": "But why with melancholy?",
  "30323": "Do you think that I deserve a recompense?",
  "30324": "Can I take the apple blossoms with me for company?",
  "30325": "How could any vanquish such a mighty antagonist?",
  "30326": "What are you dreaming of?",
  "30327": "Like whom?",
  "30328": "Why did I not fall in love with her then and propose to her?",
  "30329": "I suppose you've got your thumbs?",
  "30330": "Just's?",
  "30331": "And how long were you in the hole?",
  "30332": "What, all sons of silence, no spirit?",

  "30731": "How could I wait so long?",
  "30732": "Well, have I convinced you?",
  "30733": "Oh, where am I to go?",
  "30734": "You will not let me speak?",
  "30735": "Nothing, I suppose?",
  "30736": "And if they were pleased, would that make them immortal?",
  "30737": "What do they say to this?",
  "30738": "What design has the cardinal upon you to make him so generous?",
  "30739": "Is it indeed so?",
  "30740": "How came you to be walking here?",
  "30741": "There is the other service, the old one, that which belonged to my husband?",
  "30742": "A room just above?",
  "30743": "Will their successors falter and plead organic impotency in the nation?",
  "30744": "Now what do you think?",
  "30745": "It is in my power, think you, to make such a change at demand?",
  "30746": "It will have pity?",
  "30747": "What can I propose?",
  "30748": "Should I not be disingenuously serving my own ends?",
  "30749": "How is bread made?",
  "30750": "Do you recall him?",
  "30751": "Landlords?",
  "30752": "Should they ever again find themselves in the midst of their friends, or seated at the domestic hearth?",
  "30753": "To lead me to my death, is that enough?",
  "30754": "What use am I to make of your instruction?",
  "30755": "Where?",
  "30756": "Shall we, then, establish it for a general maxim, that no refined or elaborate reasoning is ever to be received?",
  "30757": "How did you get such big big hips?",
  "30758": "How about me?",
  "30759": "Oh?",
  "30760": "Is it deemed a holy place in the land, then?",
  "30761": "The king has not signed, however?",
  "30762": "Why the delay of a reargument?",
  "30763": "But how do you know?",
  "30764": "Should I ever meet you there?",
  "30765": "But if he did marry her in spite of the threat?",
  "30766": "Did I say a peach?",
  "30767": "What has happened since then to give you a completely new idea of the case?",
  "30768": "Has a young man, such as I am, gone through this morning, then?",
  "30769": "What am I to say, indoors?",
  "30770": "How did he evolve his ethics?",
  "30771": "Have you seen the thief?",
  "30772": "Do virtuous men, in so far as they are virtuous, stand in each other's light?",
  "30773": "Shall we bathe this morning?",
  "30774": "What's the matter now, ma'am?",
  "30775": "And is no allowance to be made for inadvertence, or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment?",
  "30776": "Or is it actual?",
  "30777": "How does she look?",
  "30778": "Married another?",
  "30779": "Do with him?",
  "30780": "And what may his name be, coptain?",
  "30781": "You might have stayed away, I suppose, if you would?",
  "30782": "Brown, convicted of mutinous conduct and sentenced to death?",
  "30783": "Who will become the sharer of this dangerous secret?",
  "30784": "What is the gift of conquest but safety?",
  "30785": "French, eh?",
  "30786": "Is he too so very remarkable?",
  "30787": "Who do you think is going to be married tomorrow?",
  "30788": "Both, on the other hand, had joined pretty gaily in the conversation, for why should they interrupt it?",
  "30789": "I regulate my watch?",
  "30790": "Do you hear, sir?",
  "30791": "How can girls like to have lovers and refuse them?",
  "30792": "Have you finished tea?",
  "30793": "What like was she?",
  "30794": "Has anything extraordinary happened to you?",
  "30795": "Who made this gruel here?",
  "30796": "And where are they?",
  "30797": "If you had been born such, would you have been here now?",
  "30798": "But how do you come here?",
  "30799": "But I wonder is it so very nice?",
  "30800": "Did it hurt you much?",
  "30801": "On what principle, then, shall we any longer choose justice rather than the worst injustice?",
  "30802": "Do you reckon YOU can learn 'em anything?",
  "30803": "What do I read here?",
  "30804": "What woman can before her husband?",
  "30805": "Who has the right to dictate to my conscience, and where did he get that right?",
  "30806": "Is she coming, and open, free?",
  "30807": "By your orders?",
  "30808": "To dig the foundations out from under that cabin with?",
  "30809": "My dear child, how can I help minding?",
  "30810": "Is this so?",
  "30811": "You'll make up for it by making another?",
  "30812": "Bubbles?",
  "30813": "Are you willing to endure to the last, and not once attempt a repayment?",
  "30814": "What are they, my dear friend?",
  "30815": "I hope you think so?",
  "30816": "But why on earth should it bother him?",
  "30817": "I wonder whether I've done well in advising that amusement?",
  "30818": "Had I?",
  "30819": "Jack?",
  "30820": "What means can I take to introduce it to the world?",
  "30821": "And so it came about that the young rat did see a good deal of the world, but how?",
  "30822": "But they will contest the will after your death?",
  "30823": "Walks by night, does she?",
  "30824": "And who is it to belong to?",
  "30825": "Is that enough?",
  "30826": "What about souls?",
  "30827": "But what have you been doing?",
  "30828": "Do we need common sense and fairness in our regulations?",
  "30829": "Oh, who does not desire to dwell forever and forever in that city of love and light when the pains and sorrows, the trials and tears, of this weary life are over?",
  "30830": "Have you let your lodgings, ma'am?",
  "30831": "Ought we to rank this one species with bears, and what should we do with the other species?",
  "30832": "Were you not engaged in it then?",
  "30833": "How do you know that, sir?",
  "30834": "Is it conscious?",
  "30835": "What do you know on the subject?",
  "30836": "And what, pray, is your idea of the duties of a devoted friend?",
  "30837": "Who can desire it more than I?",
  "30838": "What would you propose doing?",
  "30839": "What chance have I?",
  "30840": "What were his charms?",
  "30841": "Why should they not work for a uniform minimum of labour conditions through all their communities?",
  "30842": "So he has turned you out?",
  "30843": "Come for long?",
  "30844": "By the way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from?",
  "30845": "Why should he be so mean now?",
  "30846": "DO with it?",
  "30847": "Ask you what provocation I have had?",
  "30848": "Not know the thing which my own eyes beheld?",
  "30849": "Anything else?",
  "30850": "Will you taste for yourself?",
  "30851": "It's not a very nice night to be out, is it?",
  "30852": "You'll come and meet me as usual, girls?",
  "30853": "Now, had I come upon a hopeless incompatibility?",
  "30854": "Do you know what you're doing?",
  "30855": "Quite a vineyard, hey?",
  "30856": "Do I flatter myself if I allow myself to look at it in that way?",
  "30857": "Have I done right?",
  "30858": "He's all right?",
  "30859": "How can I ever thank you for all the deep obligations you impose upon me every day?",
  "30860": "Ought we not to make something great out of a youth, under twenty, who has, in the highest degree, quickness to conceive and courage to execute?",
  "30861": "Was there no loophole of escape?",
  "30862": "I suppose we must take the shapes of beasts?",
  "30863": "What are you surprised at?",
  "30864": "What did they matter when he played divinely?",
  "30865": "Tell me the why of this?",
  "30866": "But is it that makes you go?",
  "30867": "Will you graciously let me kiss your hand?",
  "30868": "Who are you to ask me my business?",
  "30869": "But does not this question make a disturbance outside of political circles?",
  "30870": "What influence can I possibly have over a bandit?",
  "30871": "Is there a carriage at the door?",
  "30872": "Do you still wish to do so?",
  "30873": "At all events, what use was there in delaying?",
  "30874": "And what right had she to be cross?",
  "30875": "What's the good, if you're sick with love for him?",
  "30876": "How should you?",
  "30877": "Is that fine, keen edge upon your soul that gives such avidity for holy things?",
  "30878": "What of the resemblance?",
  "30879": "Why a locksmiths' association in a village?",
  "30880": "Or must I fly the country altogether?",
  "30881": "What would have been the result?",
  "30882": "Back at last?",
  "30883": "What else could this fragment be but the sole surviving remnant of some sumptuous mansion that once had stood on this unrivaled site?",
  "30884": "In relation to what objects?",
  "30885": "You WERE afraid?",
  "30886": "Do you think I am deceiving you?",
  "30887": "How can you know what he is?",
  "30888": "What were you eating there all by yourself for your dinner?",
  "30889": "Are you going to sail in?",
  "30890": "Wonder if you'll ever drag me up there?",
  "30891": "Is there any need to hurry, sir?",
  "30892": "Still I ask you, what is this to me?",
  "30893": "And leave the litter as it is?",
  "30894": "Do you advance with him?",
  "30895": "So perhaps I shall rub on?",
  "30896": "In front or behind?",
  "30897": "And by what authority?",
  "30898": "Yea, what then?",
  "30899": "I really could not say?",
  "30900": "And does he imagine that the coadjutor will put himself out for him?",
  "30901": "Do you think she will ever forget that her son is her safeguard, her shield, the pledge for her dignity, for her fortune and her life?",
  "30902": "You said prince, did you not?",
  "30903": "Was it worth it?",
  "30904": "What young ladies?",
  "30905": "Shall we turn back?",
  "30906": "At the end of your name stands for?",
  "30907": "Is it not time to decide finally the meaning of the gift of the great fortune now all in your hand, and growing?",
  "30908": "Well, are we going to stand here all day?",
  "30909": "Who would not acknowledge that a poor man or woman, fain to earn daily bread by the sweat of the brow, is far more reprehensible in yielding to the solicitations of love, than a rich lady, whose life is lapped in ease and unrestricted luxury?",
  "30910": "Have we reached the limits of what reason can supply?",
  "30911": "What should I say?",
  "30912": "Did you ever, O king, hear a cat purring over a bowl of broth, or the buzzing of beetles in the twilight, or a shrill tongued old woman scolding your head off?",
  "30913": "What will gladden your heart?",
  "30914": "Are you sure it will be the last time?",
  "30915": "What is that for a man to do?",
  "30916": "Since when?",
  "30917": "Why, soldiers, why?",
  "30918": "How came you to read some of those queerer ones?",
  "30919": "Did you not love your husband either?",
  "30920": "Where is true peace or true glory?",
  "30921": "How is it now?",
  "30922": "Durys?",
  "30923": "Has the reality of them ever been perceived by you through the bodily organs?",
  "30924": "Which girls should love?",
  "30925": "When was it?",
  "30926": "Does it belong to anybody in the neighbourhood?",
  "30927": "Has anything happened?",
  "30928": "Did you hit her?",
  "30929": "Is there any signal for the general rally?",
  "30930": "About what age is he?",
  "30931": "And why did I come here?",
  "30932": "What mercy can you expect from the man whom you have wronged?",
  "30933": "Have I taken an oath of some sort, then?",
  "30934": "Shall we say, in such a case, that the will of the majority was for the ultimate end?",
  "30935": "Where what?",
  "30936": "You say?",
  "30937": "Do you no longer like to think of your mother?",
  "30938": "What are you doing?",
  "30939": "May I understand, sir, that you threat is withdrawn, and that my income is secure?",
  "30940": "Are the two so deeply separated in this town, that there is no place whatever for an honest workman between them?",
  "30941": "Why then should a man cling to a longer stay here?",
  "30942": "The symptoms are marked, do you see?",
  "30943": "Whether fate, whose circle surrounds us, exercises a control over our liberty so imperious and compulsory that infractions of the law, committed under the dominion of antinomies, cease to be imputable to us?",
  "30944": "But supposing we had the authority, I would ask what good can result from the examination?",
  "30945": "What am I coming for?",
  "30946": "But settled?",
  "30947": "Did I like his voice?",
  "30948": "How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor?",
  "30949": "Who to?",
  "30950": "And the girl?",
  "30951": "Well, have you had a good hunt, have you botanised successfully?",
  "30952": "And why should you want to spite her?",
  "30953": "What did you pick me up for?",
  "30954": "And what does 'in my name' mean?",
  "30955": "Have you ever seen it?",
  "30956": "When, then, did father and son exchange shields, and why?",
  "30957": "Would he have been justified in sacrificing his own child, even if he could thereby save another's?",
  "30958": "Why are you only laying one place?",
  "30959": "Loves him?",
  "30960": "Yet who are the folk whom you find HERE?",
  "30961": "Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?",
  "30962": "Who is coming in here?",
  "30963": "What was she going to say, and what reply would she get?",
  "30964": "Can you tell me how to go about getting on the stage?",
  "30965": "What was your idea, then?",
  "30966": "Running from what?",
  "30967": "Valdemar?",
  "30968": "How are you going to manage to get out?",
  "30969": "Have you a portmanteau?",
  "30970": "What does it matter?",
  "30971": "What depth have we now reached?",
  "30972": "What the deuse do we men go to school for?",
  "30973": "If it be called swamp or sky?",
  "30974": "How the devil is he so like?",
  "30975": "Once more, will you undertake it?",
  "30976": "Are not these functions proper to the soul, and can they rightly be assigned to any other?",
  "30977": "How's this, dear niece?",
  "30978": "Do you know who that was?",
  "30979": "Was SHE at the ball too?",
  "30980": "And what made you ask it of me?",
  "30981": "Do you know that if we should ship, it would serve you quite right?",
  "30982": "Where are your wits?",
  "30983": "Is it possible, dear, that what I hear is true?",
  "30984": "No clue?",
  "30985": "Will you give me as far from the river as you can distinguish the belly of a horse?",
  "30986": "So what if he died, how did this concern the boy?",
  "30987": "Build I in the winds my dwelling?",
  "30988": "And what more free than he that desireth nothing upon earth?",
  "30989": "And you have them?",
  "30990": "Did I indeed, sir?",
  "30991": "And are greater miracles to be performed by those who do not follow his footsteps, who healed the body to reach the mind?",
  "30992": "And did I say there was any difficulty?",
  "30993": "Have I not got a brave determination of all my doubts, and a response in all things agreeable to the oracle that gave it?",
  "30994": "Could I leave the lady alone?",
  "30995": "Is it really?",
  "30996": "Do you think I'm not sufficiently ruining my health living here amid the continual emanations of the pharmacy?",
  "30997": "How should she be able to compose herself when she should first see him?",
  "30998": "But tell me, what would you have done?",
  "30999": "Confused?",
  "31000": "Wherefrom do they acquire these tendencies, these peculiarities?",
  "31001": "Who first seduced them to that foul revolt?",
  "31002": "If they want to jump down, now, and get into trouble, who objects?",
  "31003": "Do you regard that meaning as offensive?",
  "31004": "And why does the former operation end exactly when the latter commences?",
  "31005": "What is your notion?",
  "31006": "What now was my plain duty?",
  "31007": "But where can one jump to?",
  "31008": "And how were they?",
  "31009": "Who told you his name?",
  "31010": "Who and where is he?",
  "31011": "Shall we then raise cuckolds?",
  "31012": "But that I make no admissions?",
  "31013": "Am I deceived?",
  "31014": "What's the good of daylight now?",
  "31015": "Does any man ask himself what profit he has gained from the fulfilment of his dreams, if he must still endure, still undergo hunger and thirst and toil and trouble and care?",
  "31016": "What are the facts?",
  "31017": "Have you nothing to say to us?",
  "31018": "Can you tell when there is a good fire?",
  "31019": "What on earth will she say to me, I wonder?",
  "31020": "Did you anticipate the accident which has happened to your granddaughter?",
  "31021": "What cause had you to make discoveries of his pretended passion?",
  "31022": "Elopement?",
  "31023": "How shall I be able to endure life for thirteen years?",
  "31024": "How deeply sir, you apprehend it?",
  "31025": "Cake or bread and butter?",
  "31026": "Or might you have only travelled for your amusement?",
  "31027": "Who has not seen poor birds caught by their feet in the lime?",
  "31028": "I have seen you before, I think?",
  "31029": "Does not the practice of despoiling an enemy afford an excuse for not facing the battle?",
  "31030": "The place is then, as you know, determined on rebellion?",
  "31031": "And was that the upshot of my life's hardest battle?",
  "31032": "When did you shed tears over lost souls?",
  "31033": "Is it not horrible?",
  "31034": "On plantation?",
  "31035": "When you say it that way it sounds comical, does it not?",
  "31036": "What did you do with the girl?",
  "31037": "Who would want to injure us, or damage the projectile?",
  "31038": "How do you distinguish them?",
  "31039": "Haidee, would it please you not to leave me?",
  "31040": "In the name of the ninth day, what manner of creature are you?",
  "31041": "It is then a service which you propose to render us, count?",
  "31042": "Why a blue coat?",
  "31043": "Are you here for good?",
  "31044": "What was I telling you?",
  "31045": "Snakes?",
  "31046": "Ought she to shrink in this way from the long penance of life, which was all the possibility she had of lightening the load to some other sufferers, and so changing that passionate error into a new force of unselfish human love?",
  "31047": "May I ask you a question?",
  "31048": "And yet does not your honor fear to compromise yourself by allowing such a sum to be carried away for the service of your enemy?",
  "31049": "Then have we got to part?",
  "31050": "But what do you want to do with these chickens?",
  "31051": "Do you suggest that I should do that to a similarly garbed female?",
  "31052": "And if I do not read it, what shall you do, mamma?",
  "31053": "What is going on here?",
  "31054": "Can I see her first?",
  "31055": "And the profits are large?",
  "31056": "You let him go?",
  "31057": "How can he save them?",
  "31058": "Barkis, do you mean?",
  "31059": "All right, is it?",
  "31060": "Is that the sort of fellow?",
  "31061": "And that's all you want?",
  "31062": "Number of what, child?",
  "31063": "Well, now, when you orators get that off next year, and, may be, this very year, how would you like some old grizzled farmer to get up in the grove and deny it?",
  "31064": "Fluffed in his lines, did he?",
  "31065": "But was resistance and, in the last place, victory possible?",
  "31066": "Ought not a son to love his father, whatever happens?",
  "31067": "Why, you wished to have a talk with me when the others left?",
  "31068": "Have you ever heard anything particular respecting his birth?",
  "31069": "But how did we become engaged?",
  "31070": "Did this man belong to the double enigma of order and disorder?",
  "31071": "Then he has travelled?",
  "31072": "Will you not take my word?",
  "31073": "I pray you say, what would you ask?",
  "31074": "What is the name of this obliging youth?",
  "31075": "Have they sentenced you?",
  "31076": "I am the ghost's accomplice?",
  "31077": "And has not this been our own case in the matter of equals and of absolute equality?",
  "31078": "And if I do my duty and do right, you will sustain me, will you not?",
  "31079": "Do not you also?",
  "31080": "But you will see him yourself?",
  "31081": "And yet they say that war is like a game of chess?",
  "31082": "But what does he want of them?",
  "31083": "But what's your real name?",
  "31084": "Then why did you stay with us, and blast your prospects?",
  "31085": "And the salary?",
  "31086": "Have you heard the news, sir?",
  "31087": "Or to what port are we bound?",
  "31088": "Why, then, is it, when neither law nor justice forbids it, that we are asked to spend our time and money in inquiring into its truth?",
  "31089": "And what will all her learning and her daintiness do for her, now?",
  "31090": "How has this terrible past been recalled?",
  "31091": "Am I to feed upon wisdom like a dog?",
  "31092": "Indeed, why not?",
  "31093": "Could not you, sir, estimate their maximum?",
  "31094": "Is this the fact?",
  "31095": "Barsad?",
  "31096": "And our poor cactuses, where are they?",
  "31097": "What muscles he had?",
  "31098": "Why, what do you mean?",
  "31099": "No, but what can I do?",
  "31100": "Have they allowed the headsman to escape?",
  "31101": "Is perseverance a virtue?",
  "31102": "Can you ever forgive me?",
  "31103": "You really think that your solution must be correct?",
  "31104": "Have we not already seen enough of the fallacy and extravagance of those idle theories which have amused us with promises of an exemption from the imperfections, weaknesses and evils incident to society in every shape?",
  "31105": "You have nothing further to say to me?",
  "31106": "Shall I cut away?",
  "31107": "Has he asked you to be his wife?",
  "31108": "Now, what's up?",
  "31109": "PISTHETAERUS I?",
  "31110": "Is there anything you dislike in me that you act so contrarily to my wishes?",
  "31111": "Anger?",
  "31112": "Is it not some bad affair?",
  "31113": "Will you do it?",
  "31114": "I wonder how many I shall meet going back?",
  "31115": "Could it be possible that they had escaped?",
  "31116": "Are you SURE you were quite comfortable?",

  "31910": "What must I do to attain such sublimity?",
  "31911": "You have never been married?",
  "31912": "What do they wear on their hands?",
  "31913": "And you, what do you think, young lady?",
  "31914": "Which way do we head?",
  "31915": "I take it for granted that since dawn every constable within forty miles has been looking out for a wet stranger?",
  "31916": "What have we to fear, anyhow?",
  "31917": "You said you had a clue?",
  "31918": "If it be said he cannot avoid them, shall this be in archery?",
  "31919": "How can a right to the land be based upon a difference in the quality of the land?",

  "31922": "Is this all?",
  "31923": "Dogs' heads, eh?",
  "31924": "You think?",
  "31925": "Would you murder me?",
  "31926": "Where can I drive you?",
  "31927": "There, did I do all right?",
  "31928": "Why stay to imbibe this sweet poison that was corroding the very springs of my life?",
  "31929": "Where now shall we seek them?",
  "31930": "Does that astonish you, my boy?",
  "31931": "Are you educated and he ignorant, you high and he low, you refined and he coarse, you talented and he simple?",
  "31932": "Whom else?",
  "31933": "Would he ask for items?",
  "31934": "For the second time?",
  "31935": "Why do you men want so many boats?",
  "31936": "What's the use of bothering me with medicine?",

  "31944": "Was there any possible reason other than the one she gave?",
  "31945": "But what is to be done if the direct and sole vocation of every intelligent man is babble, that is, the intentional pouring of water through a sieve?",
  "31946": "What am I to write?",
  "31947": "Krook?",
  "31948": "Things for sale, or do you want to sell anything?",
  "31949": "Would the matter be carried as far as that?",

  "31955": "Got a pin and a pencil, some of you?",
  "31956": "Against whom?",
  "31957": "Would you like fine horses, or it may be some one has offended you, and you would like his head?",
  "31958": "Wisdom, virtue, enlightenment?",
  "31959": "And what could they be talking about?",
  "31960": "And that which is opposed to them is one of the inferior principles of the soul?",
  "31961": "We may reply, and by what right do you demand payment from us for labor which we did not impose upon you?",

  "31965": "And, of course, the horse and cart were ready?",
  "31966": "That the strong bias of one decision would be apt to overrule the influence of any new lights which might be brought to vary the complexion of another decision?",
  "31967": "For who but the rich of this world can thus afford to fling pearls away?",
  "31968": "Suppose you catch it?",
  "31969": "And be merry?",
  "31970": "What are you about?",
  "31971": "What else?",
  "31972": "What's his name and address?",
  "31973": "How many times did he call upon his father?",

  "31978": "Of what consequence to science is this interminable recital of crude facts, if your analysis never extracts a single idea from them?",
  "31979": "What, my dear, are you talking about?",
  "31980": "After all, who had seen him?",
  "31981": "From such beginning of governments, what could be expected but a continued system of war and extortion?",
  "31982": "And how much did they possess?",
  "31983": "Does he limit it to the few who did him the wrong, or does he take in the many?",
  "31984": "But why should I tell you all this?",
  "31985": "Do you think I will not listen to you?",
  "31986": "What link could there be between that creature and my wife?",
  "31987": "And do you think she is not there?",
  "31988": "The law?",
  "31989": "Will you go directly?",
  "31990": "Can it be that there remains to us only the recollection of them?",
  "31991": "Not even if they were kind to you?",
  "31992": "And who will help you?",
  "31993": "And were these four men attached to each other, true in heart, really united?",
  "31994": "Have you let it?",
  "31995": "Why does the soul still tarry in my body?",
  "31996": "Who has ever heard of such a marvelous place?",
  "31997": "But in heaven's name, tell me, what was that?",
  "31998": "Where did you hear it?",
  "31999": "Do you see?",
  "32000": "And now, prisoner, will you consent to tell your name?",
  "32001": "Is he accompanied?",
  "32002": "Yes, but how?",
  "32003": "What weight can my blood add to the wool?",
  "32004": "How did he die?",
  "32005": "Says I, father, what on airth are you at?",
  "32006": "May not this prove dangerous?",
  "32007": "How is it all the better?",
  "32008": "What dreadful thing will you do next?",
  "32009": "Is your wife at home?",
  "32010": "How did your tribute arise?",
  "32011": "Well, what are you doing here, and what is your name?",
  "32012": "What are you in such a hurry for?",
  "32013": "If you know my heart, then, can you not see that it is my heart I offer you?",
  "32014": "And yet how could it possibly be so?",
  "32015": "Well, are you so sure of the little gentleman?",
  "32016": "Was it you, sir?",
  "32017": "Have you noticed anything amiss with them of late?",
  "32018": "What purpose?",
  "32019": "What possessed him to do it?",
  "32020": "Or would you like another?",
  "32021": "You should sin less, and keep better in health?",
  "32022": "What advantage would it be to me to be anything else?",
  "32023": "Has your brother or the cat been meddling?",
  "32024": "Secondly, what are the best means, and the least expensive, for accomplishing those ends?",
  "32025": "Well, tell me, I have always wanted to know, did it hurt worse going in or coming out?",
  "32026": "Will I have eyes at the bottom of the sea, supposing I descend those endless stairs?",
  "32027": "Do you understand it at last?",
  "32028": "Now you quit it, do you hear?",
  "32029": "What is to be done now?",
  "32030": "Has she slept through it?",
  "32031": "Was there any idea at all connected with it?",
  "32032": "Is this the man?",
  "32033": "You will take something or other, surely?",
  "32034": "Did you stop there?",
  "32035": "And where did you get so much money?",
  "32036": "But they'll recognize you?",
  "32037": "Have you any message?",
  "32038": "May I come out to you in the garden presently?",
  "32039": "Where has she gone?",
  "32040": "But what's the idea of your new picture?",
  "32041": "But would it not be salutary to give also the means of preventing their commission?",
  "32042": "Have all gentlemen's servants warts upon their noses, mother?",
  "32043": "Bene curasti hoc jumentam?",
  "32044": "Who was right then?",
  "32045": "Why to me?",
  "32046": "Did you see what a fool he looked?",
  "32047": "Perhaps a dodge?",
  "32048": "What is it for?",
  "32049": "Cannot you stay a few minutes longer?",
  "32050": "Do you refuse this lady's hand whom I now offer you?",
  "32051": "Where are you going there?",
  "32052": "Your lordship will recall inquiring of me on the night of the ball as to the bona fides of one of the temporary waiters?",
  "32053": "Would you set a cloud to chase the wind?",
  "32054": "The strength one can eke from little, who knows till he has been subjected to the trial?",
  "32055": "Would you, my reader, like to be more gentle in your manner?",
  "32056": "You had your portfolio with you, then?",
  "32057": "What is the good of repentance like that?",
  "32058": "They are laying supper over there, are they?",
  "32059": "You have some in the house, have you not?",
  "32060": "Did he then love the rhythmic rise and fall of words better than their associations of legend and colour?",
  "32061": "Is not the most important problem that of getting the right man at the head of the company?",
  "32062": "Now, then, who can point out any sinless person in the present world?",
  "32063": "You are in love?",
  "32064": "WHAT IS IT?",
  "32065": "Shall I love all men, then, for the sake of one?",
  "32066": "How can they, he said, when they are not allowed to apply their minds to the callings of any of these?",
  "32067": "Are you really not to be persuaded, even now, to pass the night under my roof?",
  "32068": "What for, then?",
  "32069": "Is my husband's political career likely to suffer through this incident?",
  "32070": "Besides, where were these poor girls to go?",
  "32071": "Do you really think so?",
  "32072": "About what am I now employing my own soul?",
  "32073": "Do you speak by way of offence, sir?",
  "32074": "Why did you name them all with the same name?",
  "32075": "Well, I ask, what can the intervention of power, with the assistance of civil law and political economy, accomplish here?",
  "32076": "A bottle, perhaps?",
  "32077": "What do you expect to do in the midst of this darkness?",
  "32078": "And did she not even go to him?",
  "32079": "What other forces were arrayed?",
  "32080": "And why do they worry me so?",
  "32081": "What becomes, then, of the doctrine of expiation and abstinence, the morality of sacrifice, resignation, and happy moderation?",
  "32082": "If she makes up her mind to tell you, you will come and let me know, will you not?",
  "32083": "What is this rubbish?",
  "32084": "What is he doing there?",
  "32085": "Her name and family?",
  "32086": "What knave is this?",
  "32087": "But what did I know?",
  "32088": "Had he reached the point of forgetting the mayor's presence?",
  "32089": "Three?",
  "32090": "How could she do it, how can it be possible that she is a woman like that?",
  "32091": "Can we find any such connection in the case of a public work executed by a government?",
  "32092": "What sort of an entertainment, captain?",
  "32093": "How did he make it enter in?",
  "32094": "What do you reckon did it, boys?",
  "32095": "How do you help it?",
  "32096": "Is it not truly to clothe the naked, to procure for them a garment of light, a raiment of glory?",
  "32097": "Just give me one of those roses in the bunch you are wearing, will you?",
  "32098": "Harrison?",
  "32099": "Unless indeed you know me, and have some purpose in your brain?",
  "32100": "Is he conscious?",
  "32101": "Had his forms of expression changed, or his sentiments become less laudable?",
  "32102": "But what is it you wish?",
  "32103": "Why notice it?",
  "32104": "Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?",
  "32105": "On what charge?",
  "32106": "Is he not a handsome lad?",
  "32107": "Haue you hope of life?",
  "32108": "What is the remedy?",
  "32109": "You think so, do you?",
  "32110": "What would he himself say a couple of years after the event?",
  "32111": "How are you to act?",
  "32112": "Is it long since you came?",
  "32113": "By you?",
  "32114": "And will you let me play a few of your accompaniments?",
  "32115": "Sell my rapier?",
  "32116": "Is he prosperous and happy?",
  "32117": "Why will not people lend their money?",
  "32118": "Guess what?",
  "32119": "For sheer terror?",
  "32120": "Did you know this?",
  "32121": "What did I tell you about making me creak the door?",
  "32122": "And in what consists this plot?",
  "32123": "Whether those pleading orators were persons educated in the general knowledge of equity, or only in provincial, national, and other local customs?",
  "32124": "Shall I fetch you another cup?",
  "32125": "How's that for high living?",
  "32126": "Then for what reason did he call me son?",
  "32127": "And why do you keep following me about?",
  "32128": "Is it worth while to keep an army to protect you in writing proclamations, or to get once a year into winter quarters?",
  "32129": "Well, what's to be done?",
  "32130": "You mean you'll join us?",
  "32131": "Have you given this man work before?",
  "32132": "In the way, you mean, of living with US?",
  "32133": "Is he from home?",
  "32134": "Is there a house in the neighborhood?",
  "32135": "What were you doing on that armchair?",
  "32136": "What say my other friends?",
  "32137": "Some one?",
  "32138": "Do you then suspect any one?",
  "32139": "But why should you have been anxious?",
  "32140": "What size do you want to be?",
  "32141": "Now, is there any sense in these things?",
  "32142": "What manner of man is he?",
  "32143": "I might let that to you, for what matters it to me?",
  "32144": "What was the opinion?",
  "32145": "Nothing to you?",
  "32146": "I suppose you have had dinner?",
  "32147": "Where in the word did you acquire such a voluminous vocabulary?",
  "32148": "And what if other benefits were gained by peace?",
  "32149": "What is it, father?",
  "32150": "What did you tell him?",
  "32151": "From the cardinal?",
  "32152": "Is it far from here, sir?",
  "32153": "When was he married?",
  "32154": "Was she beautiful?",
  "32155": "You're staying the night, I hope?",
  "32156": "What would I want wedding so young?",
  "32157": "What IOU's?",
  "32158": "Do you know anything?",
  "32159": "If this sad picture you have drawn, be indeed true to nature, how does your country, said I, appear so attractive, as to draw to it so large a portion of our population?",
  "32160": "That's interesting, eh?",
  "32161": "Whither so soon?",
  "32162": "Did you find no trace of him?",
  "32163": "The sovereigns?",
  "32164": "A physician?",
  "32165": "Where ought I be, then?",
  "32166": "Who said that she was to belong to you?",
  "32167": "In this place?",
  "32168": "You mean it is a little dry, perhaps?",
  "32169": "You are not touched even by that danger?",
  "32170": "Then this racket they are making is on account of it, I suppose?",
  "32171": "For what is he in prison then?",
  "32172": "Would exasperation, however, if relief had longer been postponed, finally have betrayed me?",
  "32173": "What did I mean by asking questions?",
  "32174": "Will you dance with me?",
  "32175": "Can you dive?",
  "32176": "More rabbits?",
  "32177": "For this?",
  "32178": "Was there any connection between the commotion of the atmosphere and that of the interior of the earth?",
  "32179": "A merry going forth bringeth often a sorrowful return, and a merry evening maketh a sad morning?",
  "32180": "And even of what he knew, how much could he make his untravelled friend either apprehend or believe?",
  "32181": "When did you enter the room?",
  "32182": "Whom have I to live for?",
  "32183": "Going to lose her?",
  "32184": "And may we be so bold as to affirm that there are also many criminals to be found in them, rogues who have stings, and whom the authorities are careful to restrain by force?",
  "32185": "For such matters?",
  "32186": "And do you object to going through the village?",
  "32187": "What do you think of that figure there?",
  "32188": "To how many people can any one tell all?",
  "32189": "Could a body hypocritically take there a small hypocritical touch?",
  "32190": "How have they made me a victim?",
  "32191": "But where can he be?",
  "32192": "How am I?",
  "32193": "And what did she say?",
  "32194": "What could he have done to me?",
  "32195": "Do you take us for thieves?",
  "32196": "For a young cobra?",
  "32197": "Theramenes?",
  "32198": "France?",
  "32199": "Tell me, my dear sir, do you admit the existence of volcanoes on the moon's surface?",
  "32200": "Was it not necessary for the good of the state and the interests of the young king, that you should live in good intelligence with the queen?",
  "32201": "What could be the meaning of his sudden change toward me?",
  "32202": "He warned you to abandon your visit?",
  "32203": "Did you really come to propose to me?",
  "32204": "And then, you ungrateful being, you are not pleased to see an old friend?",
  "32205": "Will you return to this gang of robbers, and to this man, when a word can save you?",
  "32206": "Because of the money?",
  "32207": "Who could place my feet on the right path, and bring me back to my company?",
  "32208": "Why did you pull the curtain over the place to make me think you were still there?",
  "32209": "And are the hours the same?",
  "32210": "What is the reason?",
  "32211": "Money is no object?",
  "32212": "Where, then, could the driver be, unless he were inside the house?",
  "32213": "Nay, has not a little rationality exposed many women to the severest censure?",
  "32214": "Was that all right?",
  "32215": "What is it?",
  "32216": "Why is the ardour of youth thus to be damped, and the luxuriancy of fancy cut to the quick?",
  "32217": "If there be no distinction between the pleasing and the disgusting, why does it accept the one or reject the other?",
  "32218": "How is that?",
  "32219": "What consolation does the poor suffering soul find in the superb coffin, in the splendid funeral?",
  "32220": "And what am I myself?",
  "32221": "Egeria?",
  "32222": "Have you dined?",
  "32223": "You are very lonely, are you not?",
  "32224": "Do you try to force them?",
  "32225": "What do you all say to a wrestling match?",
  "32226": "What will the servants think?",
  "32227": "Would it still kick and show temper, then?",
  "32228": "Does he wish us to draw conclusions?",
  "32229": "Now, what is the harvest fortnight to be?",
  "32230": "Notwithstanding your father's wishes to the contrary?",
  "32231": "How many other families have never had that same opportunity?",
  "32232": "Ye higher men, what think ye?",
  "32233": "Are there many of them?",
  "32234": "I am now among princes like myself, am I not?",
  "32235": "What do you mean by tetragones?",
  "32236": "And you have been in the choir in pursuance of your duties?",
  "32237": "If all is well, why go to the lodge?",
  "32238": "None?",
  "32239": "In displaying anxiety for the breath of which he was at present so willing to get rid, might I not lay myself open to the exactions of his avarice?",
  "32240": "By what path did you get thither?",
  "32241": "Can we get behind his track so that they may smell it?",
  "32242": "You have how many new suits?",
  "32243": "How far mus go up, massa?",
  "32244": "Where's that?",
  "32245": "Is she discouraged, does she drag herself about the house and find fault with everything?",
  "32246": "What whole thing?",
  "32247": "Since it was your intention to live alone, why did you throw into the sea the document which put us on your track?",
  "32248": "If this were human life, if these were human beings, living in a complete world, then what was her own world, outside?",
  "32249": "We are at peace and, why then, should they harm us?",
  "32250": "Then you believe the papers?",
  "32251": "What must I do, officer?",
  "32252": "What do you like to talk about?",
  "32253": "Getting a bit hot, eh?",
  "32254": "If she had wished it, would she not have sent to me by this time?",
  "32255": "Or whom oppose?",
  "32256": "Was it, when he set his heart upon it?",
  "32257": "You, who refuse to tell me the slightest thing?",
  "32258": "Where's mama?",
  "32259": "Are we in any great danger?",
  "32260": "Or will a reaction set in which may arrest progress and even undo much that has been done?",
  "32261": "You are only responsible for my body, is it not so?",
  "32262": "But for this imaginary resistance, officially announced, how would it have been possible to justify the spoliations and exactions which ensued?",
  "32263": "How can you deliberately get up such paltry falsehoods?",
  "32264": "Afterwards to me?",
  "32265": "Carries a bag?",
  "32266": "Shall you not all help me?",
  "32267": "What signified the terms to them, so long as we obtained the actual surrender of people who only wanted a good opportunity to give up gracefully?",
  "32268": "Shall I cut it out?",
  "32269": "Would not the doing of this be your best mode of counteracting his raid on your communications?",
  "32270": "After dinner, eh?",
  "32271": "Well, what, my dear girl?",
  "32272": "What would they say if I did not go?",
  "32273": "But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?",
  "32274": "But to what in the world?",
  "32275": "By your leave, do you know me, sir?",
  "32276": "He will be ruined, you mean?",
  "32277": "What of the prisoner?",
  "32278": "Do you not see that by its solidification, it would burst through this field of ice that imprisons us, as, when it freezes, it bursts the hardest stones?",
  "32279": "Then it appears there will be an opposition, and the enterprise will be disputed?",
  "32280": "Have you heard?",
  "32281": "Will you dine with me?",
  "32282": "Does he ever come back to this neighborhood?",
  "32283": "And, if ignorance of everything which it is needful a ruler should know is likely to do so much harm in the governing classes of the future, why is it, they ask reasonably enough, that such ignorance in the governing classes of the past has not been viewed with equal horror?",
  "32284": "And now, tell me your name?",
  "32285": "Do you fear their finding it here, should they come to search?",
  "32286": "Whither are they going?",
  "32287": "What is it, now?",

  "32405": "Nicholas, when when did you break your cameo?",
  "32406": "D'you remember the last time we met?",
  "32407": "What hope could there have been for him then?",
  "32408": "You have no mother?",
  "32409": "Outside of a private car?",
  "32410": "And what was this spring of the floor under his feet to the dizzy eccentric lurch with which in the old time the trembling ship yielded to the beat of staggering billows, drunk with their power?",

  "32437": "Perhaps you would like to pay interest?",
  "32438": "Which is she?",
  "32439": "Is that any reason why we should propose to preserve it for ever in a condition of tutelage?",
  "32440": "And my walking up and down for three hours from the table to the stove?",
  "32441": "Not chops?",
  "32442": "Would he choose the peers, for example?",

  "32456": "It is not so?",
  "32457": "Then I shall really have them?",
  "32458": "So you go back from your promise?",
  "32459": "May she?",
  "32460": "Do you remember what I said when you asked me what I should do if I won all the pots I set my heart on and came through alive?",
  "32461": "Is it too great?",
  "32462": "At it again, hey?",
  "32463": "Which was it?",
  "32464": "Do you believe in presentiments and superstitions?",

  "32480": "And we recognize also that this absolute equality has only been known, and can only be known, through the medium of sight or touch, or of some other of the senses, which are all alike in this respect?",
  "32481": "Know you anything of your own family at that time?",
  "32482": "And from a noble client?",
  "32483": "So that, in fact, you have never learned or heard anything in particular?",
  "32484": "What was said or done?",
  "32485": "And where will your worship drink?",
  "32486": "How is it that you have no friends in your prosperity when you had many in adversity?",

  "32497": "What about the other girl, the one you decoyed away over a week ago?",
  "32498": "How could she not be happy?",
  "32499": "It has been a delightful evening, has it not?",
  "32500": "And now, doctor, what are we to do about money?",
  "32501": "Had they not searched exactly where the document stated?",
  "32502": "How you like it, hey, ole sport?",
  "32503": "But what human language can adequately portray that astonishment, that horror which possessed me at the spectacle then presented to view?",
  "32504": "At best, might not a man in the water lose all his power of direction, and so move in an endless circle until he sank exhausted?",
  "32505": "Does his wife know of it?",
  "32506": "And what is the solar heat?",
  "32507": "If any one were to come in, my dear boy?",
  "32508": "Has your grace taken the precaution to come out in a good stout pair of boots?",

  "32513": "How could he take the infant from the mother's breast, or abandon the daughter to the fatal influences from which only, by so violent an effort, he could free the son?",
  "32514": "Was that all a human being amounted to?",
  "32515": "But you would not advise me to refuse?",
  "32516": "And so much to my honour too?",
  "32517": "And why look there?",

  "32528": "But why?",
  "32529": "And could it be believed that it at last seems to us as if the problem had never been propounded before, as if we were the first to discern it, get a sight of it, and RISK RAISING it?",
  "32530": "If you come to that, it's hardly my place to be flung out of the flat like this and have to go to an hotel, what?",
  "32531": "Will you open, yes or no?",
  "32532": "If so, on what does your constitution rest?",

  "32567": "Why did you come, then?",
  "32568": "What was the abbe's name?",
  "32569": "Never see you again?",
  "32570": "Would the lock click at the end of those seemingly interminable intervals of time?",

  "32572": "Why am I left here alone?",
  "32573": "Do you mean to say you think we are going to have bad weather?",
  "32574": "But who attributes to the animals a belief that the phenomena of nature are worked by a multitude of invisible animals or by one enormous and prodigiously strong animal behind the scenes?",

  "32596": "And how the deuce could I, even if I knew every girl in the place?",
  "32597": "But would she pass on, or would she put into port?",
  "32598": "You looked into the cellars?",
  "32599": "How could you be so rude, so mean, and cruel to us both?",
  "32600": "Was not the selection of the male guardians determined by differences of this sort?",
  "32601": "Why, who do you think this is?",
  "32602": "Is that his design in settling here?",

  "32620": "Do you think as it could be a rabbit?",
  "32621": "But how did you get to work again?",
  "32622": "Would it not, moreover, be much more easy for him to gain his daughter, if he did all in his power to forward his father's views?",
  "32623": "And in what way does he who thinks that wisdom is the discernment of the tempers and tastes of the motley multitude, whether in painting or music, or, finally, in politics, differ from him whom I have been describing?",
  "32624": "What man could be more lovable than such a man as would grow from such a boy?",

  "32635": "How long have you been married?",
  "32636": "Yet who is there does not sometimes hazard it for the enjoyment of an hour?",
  "32637": "Now for what, my dear friend?",
  "32638": "You will promise me that, at any rate?",
  "32639": "What was their languid grace but the softness of chambering?",
  "32640": "Was it not natural that, in the indignation excited by their wrongs, they should turn to the man who had laid the axe to the root of the tree which bore such fruit, and at least consider the possibility of profiting by his work?",
  "32641": "Could I count them on my fingers?",
  "32642": "May I come in?",
  "32643": "Are you for the rich or for the poor?",
  "32644": "Whose is he?",
  "32645": "Who has been telling you about him?",

  "32652": "Do you seek any guidance from me?",
  "32653": "How on earth should she talk of any one else as long as you are here?",
  "32654": "And a narrative it remains both in the speeches which the poet recites from time to time and in the intermediate passages?",
  "32655": "And others say even that the external world is the work of our organs?",
  "32656": "Am I sorry?",
  "32657": "And, indeed, unless this shoal had a machine in its stomach, how could it change its position with such astonishing rapidity?",
  "32658": "Could the prisoners see each other?",
  "32659": "But why do you ask?",
  "32660": "Are you quite sure, then, that you WILL come to see him often?",
  "32661": "Till then, will you be one, sir?",
  "32662": "And will you undertake to deliver it?",
  "32663": "Well, did you like it?",
  "32664": "Where is my aunt?",
  "32665": "You are horrified?",
  "32666": "Who can say where the dominion of mind over matter ceases?",
  "32667": "But if you think all servitude intolerable, to what purpose serve your complaint against your particular governors?",
  "32668": "If he were so delighted by my visit, why had he not crossed the lawn at once as soon as he saw the car?",
  "32669": "What odds then?",

  "33065": "Who would hear her?",
  "33066": "Do you not see that they are all giving me the wink, and wanting me to turn you out by force, only I do not like to do so?",
  "33067": "And are you glad to see me?",
  "33068": "And what is the pay?",
  "33069": "Has he now some disciples?",
  "33070": "To sleep?",
  "33071": "What'll it be?",
  "33072": "But a little rakish, hey?",
  "33073": "With friends like that, who needs enemies?",
  "33074": "A bride?",
  "33075": "Or what is become of them?",
  "33076": "Is he indeed, sir?",
  "33077": "He will not talk to me about it, so why should I trouble him?",
  "33078": "But is not your eminence going to the queen?",
  "33079": "At once?",
  "33080": "Will it be long first?",
  "33081": "But am I sure?",
  "33082": "Rita?",
  "33083": "Who took that step?",
  "33084": "What's better in him?",
  "33085": "But why should I make a long story?",

  "33117": "Do you hear what I say?",
  "33118": "Of what complexion?",
  "33119": "Is she to be shown up to your room?",
  "33120": "And, if I said so, to whom would the place belong?",
  "33121": "If they are not, with what propriety can the like power justify such a charge against the national government, or even be urged as an obstacle to its adoption?",
  "33122": "Is no one about who can get in?",

  "33137": "Is it because we are invited?",
  "33138": "Will you walk a little bit with me?",
  "33139": "Do you deny that you were listening at that door?",
  "33140": "How soon may we hope to get back?",
  "33141": "Is the wind north or south?",
  "33142": "Yet how could he think her capable of deliberately wishing to renew their assignations now?",
  "33143": "Aluminum?",
  "33144": "How could it have been me?",
  "33145": "What makes you say that?",
  "33146": "And who will be the warden of the hospital?",
  "33147": "What's that that has fallen?",
  "33148": "Has judgment been pronounced?",
  "33149": "And who is the criminal?",
  "33150": "Can you row?",
  "33151": "Can he spare you?",
  "33152": "Shall we ever know?",

  "33161": "And you did not know any one else on the train?",
  "33162": "You intend to remain?",
  "33163": "No guarantee?",
  "33164": "Are you asking for a lodger?",
  "33165": "And if it knew, would it dare?",
  "33166": "And what do you call that little metal ruler?",
  "33167": "What is advantage?",
  "33168": "You are not going, papa?",
  "33169": "Is that what you have been trying?",
  "33170": "My little woman, why do you look at me in that way?",
  "33171": "What do you want to say?",
  "33172": "Is yours a long part?",
  "33173": "Gentle?",
  "33174": "What is POLITICS?",
  "33175": "What did their tears imply?",
  "33176": "What shall the court do?",
  "33177": "But what do YOU think?",
  "33178": "If he had not lost his balance, why should he have launched into an almost passionate defence of the physical coward?",
  "33179": "And is it not very rational to conclude, that the women who have not been taught to respect the human nature of their own sex, in these particulars, will not long respect the mere difference of sex, in their husbands?",
  "33180": "What is the object of these questions?",
  "33181": "Oh you're there, are you?",
  "33182": "How much may it amount to?",
  "33183": "Shall I tell him all, then, openly?",
  "33184": "Oswald, have you not your mother to come to the rescue?",
  "33185": "O, do you know me, man?",
  "33186": "And how do you get on with the officers?",
  "33187": "How dare you come when you're not wanted?",
  "33188": "Is it certainly accursed?",
  "33189": "But to do this he must have spoken?",
  "33190": "Have you ever died yet?",
  "33191": "Who would ever suspect me, me, me, especially if I should choose a being I had no interest in doing away with?",
  "33192": "Trust to the sword the fortunes of the world?",
  "33193": "Where is your crown, then?",
  "33194": "And even if there's a delay, how can it alter the end?",
  "33195": "It will not be opened when the hearing is resumed?",
  "33196": "Then what does he do?",
  "33197": "Have the rebels been successful up to this time?",
  "33198": "You saw this?",

  "33608": "There's nothing wrong?",
  "33609": "NOT a party in anything, ma'am?",
  "33610": "Have I cut my heart into a demd extraordinary number of little pieces, and given them all away, one after another, to the same little engrossing demnition captivater, and can I live to be suspected by her?",
  "33611": "Then what?",
  "33612": "Supper?",
  "33613": "Can anyone do much for anyone else unless by making a will in his favour and dying then and there?",
  "33614": "Did we not leave her, but just now?",
  "33615": "Then?",
  "33616": "Has anything worried you?",
  "33617": "And who shall then stick closest to ye, and excite others?",
  "33618": "Can I rely upon you?",
  "33619": "Oh, you are the young feller who did that poster?",
  "33620": "Do you know of any houses?",
  "33621": "Do you mean to say that this slip of paper will help us?",
  "33622": "What identity?",
  "33623": "Did you bring the things I mentioned?",
  "33624": "But, my lord, if there be no secret of penitence, will the director consent to my being here?",
  "33625": "Do you have a faith, or a knowledge, you follow, which helps you to live and to do right?",
  "33626": "Is not this what we would have all men do to us?",
  "33627": "You hussy, how dare you talk in that way?",
  "33628": "Now, what shall we do?",
  "33629": "Which should it be?",
  "33630": "Will you follow me?",
  "33631": "What else can I do?",
  "33632": "How would you like to come into a house and find everyone muttering to themselves?",
  "33633": "And can the just by justice make men unjust, or speaking general can the good by virtue make them bad?",
  "33634": "You're sure?",
  "33635": "Are we to see profound wisdom in this?",
  "33636": "Is it not, said she, whispering her husband in his ear, is it not a noble nose?",
  "33637": "Who'll keep THEM quiet?",
  "33638": "Had any difference arisen between him and her papa?",
  "33639": "And what shall I?",
  "33640": "Not so much so?",
  "33641": "You are fond of it?",
  "33642": "May I see it?",
  "33643": "Tell me, do you know what the countess, for whose pardon you are beseeching me, has done?",
  "33644": "Had she not openly avowed her intention of marrying for money if she ever had the chance?",
  "33645": "That the boy may sink and perish?",
  "33646": "Whose there?",
  "33647": "Been there long?",
  "33648": "Which is the way?",
  "33649": "Or his starch'd beard?",
  "33650": "Who knows what may be in store for you yet?",
  "33651": "By this?",
  "33652": "And not long?",
  "33653": "Is that certain?",
  "33654": "Are you asleep?",
  "33655": "Any ideas?",
  "33656": "Have we been deceived by an illusion?",
  "33657": "Was it physical?",
  "33658": "Caution?",
  "33659": "Did not you know that, my dear lord?",
  "33660": "Did not your friend here look like me?",
  "33661": "What are you rattling in there?",
  "33662": "But again, will they tell us that such a nature, placed under favourable circumstances, will not be perfectly good and wise if any ever was?",
  "33663": "Has not one of you a cross?",
  "33664": "And what does the judge affirm to be the life which is next, and the pleasure which is next?",
  "33665": "Was my uncle stark mad?",
  "33666": "Or have we found angels in the forms of kings to govern him?",
  "33667": "More in your brains than in your pocket, eh?",
  "33668": "He has come, then, as they told me?",
  "33669": "The only unofficial detective?",
  "33670": "Have you had lunch yet?",
  "33671": "Far from here?",
  "33672": "Whither is it carrying me?",
  "33673": "And where are they looking for her?",
  "33674": "Who told you this?",
  "33675": "Of what was he thinking?",
  "33676": "Do you think it is too much?",
  "33677": "D'you remember you were rather sniffy about meeting him?",
  "33678": "Is that what you wished to say?",
  "33679": "How much of the ballast of conservatism and of loyalty to tradition is it well to throw overboard in the interest of accelerated motion?",
  "33680": "Shall a similar end be pursued for the ethical purpose of widening the circle of those who shall live and be happy?",
  "33681": "Why have they not seized me?",
  "33682": "When did it happen and what has happened?",
  "33683": "You see?",
  "33684": "How could we like a people who treated us so unjustly?",
  "33685": "When shall the day come when we shall lift our hands?",
  "33686": "Are you then making a thesis?",
  "33687": "Would you like me to bring some rice?",
  "33688": "Who do you want?",
  "33689": "How did he get 'em?",
  "33690": "And is my life to be forfeit, is some terrible punishment to come on my poor old head for that which I cannot help?",
  "33691": "You will be frank with me?",
  "33692": "And was that the head and front of his offending?",
  "33693": "And must he not be represented as such?",
  "33694": "But what's he doing here?",
  "33695": "While he indulged himself in this state, amidst a profound silence, the curate, approaching him with great reverence, asked him if he would not be pleased to honour him with his company at dinner?",
  "33696": "He said nothing more?",
  "33697": "And even if he has done wrong, how do I know that he has not condemned himself?",
  "33698": "And do they give you frogs to eat, so's to make you limber?",
  "33699": "A doctor?",
  "33700": "What did you do?",
  "33701": "Would he allow imitation to be the ruling principle of his life, as if he had nothing higher in him?",
  "33702": "That's what you tell this gentleman too, is it?",
  "33703": "He's your husband, eh?",
  "33704": "Can I spare him?",
  "33705": "What now?",
  "33706": "Armed?",
  "33707": "Or may not all three be properly allotted to it?",
  "33708": "Anything up?",
  "33709": "Is that so?",
  "33710": "You do not wish to hear it, perhaps?",
  "33711": "What does it matter to me?",
  "33712": "And will not a true astronomer have the same feeling when he looks at the movements of the stars?",
  "33713": "Why, what else are they?",
  "33714": "And s'pose he steps in here any minute, and sings out my name before I can throw him a wink to keep quiet?",
  "33715": "And the just is the good?",
  "33716": "How have I deviated from those principles, monsieur?",
  "33717": "But why FOUR pounds?",
  "33718": "And what did you find?",
  "33719": "What has he come here for?",
  "33720": "Are you inside?",
  "33721": "Downright?",
  "33722": "Do you think she'll miss you?",
  "33723": "Why was it necessary to weave the queen into this gloomy web of guilt and crime?",
  "33724": "I suppose that is why you live in town?",
  "33725": "What was the result of that memorable expedition?",
  "33726": "What, then, is the defence?",
  "33727": "What do you mean by risk?",
  "33728": "What would be the use?",
  "33729": "How could she make such nails work?",
  "33730": "Am I not the wife of my husband?",
  "33731": "What came after?",
  "33732": "Supposing her to be as good a woman as any you can find, which she certainly is not, why do you wish to connect yourself with anybody at present?",
  "33733": "What is the proposition?",
  "33734": "So?",
  "33735": "How is the snatchblatch?",
  "33736": "Just?",
  "33737": "Did you hear anything of it when you were in those parts?",
  "33738": "What is in this?",
  "33739": "And through what deplorable madness had she thus ruined her life by continual sacrifices?",
  "33740": "Where are the marks of its fangs?",
  "33741": "Who was this novice in war with the effrontery of a luminary?",
  "33742": "In my precinct?",
  "33743": "Is she, my lord?",
  "33744": "May this young lady go with us?",
  "33745": "Has no one come to seek her in this land?",
  "33746": "Then you'll be free?",
  "33747": "Monseigneur?",
  "33748": "Is it not sad?",
  "33749": "Can people enchant each other too much, cajole each other too much, charm each other too much?",
  "33750": "Why do they grease the axles of the wheels?",
  "33751": "If there be doubt as to which of our divisions will get our candidate, is there no doubt as to which of your candidates will get your party?",
  "33752": "What did you take me to your mother for?",
  "33753": "And did they ask you to make a speech?",
  "33754": "Some such object it was, that induced you to call on me?",
  "33755": "But how about money?",
  "33756": "You here at this hour?",
  "33757": "Well, then, was it this eye or that through which you dropped the beetle?",
  "33758": "What did your excellency say?",
  "33759": "Will you then swear to me, that you will never, under any pretext, and from any motive whatsoever, betray to anybody, so much as a single word of what I am now about to tell you?",
  "33760": "Where are you going, you rascal?",
  "33761": "Do you know, my friends, what that plain, seen from the height we are at, resembles?",
  "33762": "What was the good of bringing him?",
  "33763": "Where was it?",
  "33764": "Would she be decent to him, or would she scold him?",
  "33765": "Which is the best wish to wish him?",
  "33766": "How CAN you say 'I am happier,' and nothing changed?",
  "33767": "Why sadden the poor children, and damp their newly cherished hopes?",
  "33768": "And you feel convinced that you must break with him?",
  "33769": "Alone, where?",
  "33770": "And you saw him frequently?",
  "33771": "Why is she so glad?",
  "33772": "But why do you ask?",
  "33773": "What new treasures lay here for science to unfold?",
  "33774": "Rochester?",
  "33775": "What's coming on?",
  "33776": "Are we to wonder, then, if here and there we find in his works an offensive expression?",
  "33777": "Why not cut it?",
  "33778": "What does the letter mean, mother?",
  "33779": "Are we rising into a fiery furnace?",
  "33780": "What substances will you proscribe?",
  "33781": "And what method of surveillance do you employ?",
  "33782": "Oh, well, as it were, what?",
  "33783": "You think so?",
  "33784": "Of how much?",
  "33785": "But we could not prevent it, could we?",
  "33786": "You get your percentage out o' the purchase, I suppose?",
  "33787": "Food enough for all?",
  "33788": "Has she told you she likes me much?",
  "33789": "Why should I envy them?",
  "33790": "What did he say to you?",
  "33791": "But if he were taken back again he would imagine, and truly imagine, that he was descending?",
  "33792": "My friend, my friend, why thus grieve me?",
  "33793": "How does that strike you?",
  "33794": "Forty pounds?",
  "33795": "But I mean another piece?",
  "33796": "Are all voters enlightened?",
  "33797": "And his level, whether higher or lower, could it possibly be the same as hers?",
  "33798": "What makes you so sure?",
  "33799": "What is it in the nature of the oak that causes it to send its root down into the soil and to drink up of its substance?",

  "33801": "Where shall I go?",
  "33802": "Are then at this time the revolutions of the heavens, the constellations of the firmament, and aspects of the planets such, that whosoever shall lose a hatchet shall immediately grow rich?",
  "33803": "What was the primitive tissue?",
  "33804": "How much do you pay a week?",
  "33805": "And he is named?",
  "33806": "How came you by the knowledge?",
  "33807": "Why not win to freedom?",
  "33808": "Does he?",
  "33809": "And if not in the worst, why is it to follow at all?",
  "33810": "What, pray?",
  "33811": "Wherefore?",
  "33812": "Shall I be that?",
  "33813": "And what shall we say of such things as religious duties, of cheerfulness, of good manners, of personal cleanliness?",
  "33814": "Or, have you been a bad steward to yourself, and wasted your property in lawsuits and the like?",
  "33815": "Ah, who put it up?",
  "33816": "But light?",
  "33817": "What has opened her eyes?",
  "33818": "Do you want him?",
  "33819": "And would you indeed damn your precious soul?",
  "33820": "Well, did you see her safely off?",
  "33821": "But is he engaged to her?",
  "33822": "Why, how are all the folks at home?",
  "33823": "Are these persons, then, so rich and powerful?",
  "33824": "Can it give heat to a dead body?",
  "33825": "Where's the use of looking nice, when no one sees me but those cross midgets, and no one cares whether I'm pretty or not?",
  "33826": "And the king has seen the cardinal?",
  "33827": "Detain him?",
  "33828": "And return to life, if there be such a thing, is the birth of the dead into the world of the living?",
  "33829": "Or do you also hate the duke your husband?",
  "33830": "Do you know who it is from?",
  "33831": "Have you been to the opera?",
  "33832": "Not a word to your loving mother, who was growing older too?",
  "33833": "Would you be at ease, and feel that you had played an open part?",
  "33834": "Has your majesty no other orders to give me?",
  "33835": "But what are you going to do with him, now he is alive?",
  "33836": "And what shall I do when papa and you leave me, and I am by myself?",
  "33837": "Why is he sleeping there?",
  "33838": "Had he not told her, yes, told her to make a list, and not to admit anyone who was not on that list?",
  "33839": "Were her fears realized?",
  "33840": "I suppose it bowled the poor blighter over absolutely?",
  "33841": "Who introduced this innovation?",
  "33842": "You are perhaps a tulip fancier?",
  "33843": "May I go in and look?",
  "33844": "When will we be married?",
  "33845": "You're in the habit of shaking hands?",

  "33852": "And ten?",
  "33853": "Do you think if I drink water it would take off this hiccup?",
  "33854": "And this one opposite, who is this?",
  "33855": "Neither may they imitate smiths or other artificers, or oarsmen, or boatswains, or the like?",
  "33856": "You'll be ready this day week, will you?",
  "33857": "How was it possible for one poor tongue, so reviled and persecuted, so humbled, insulted, and triumphed over, to resist three tongues in league against it?",
  "33858": "What was become of them?",
  "33859": "Shall we gather strength but irresolution and inaction?",
  "33860": "And what was in the sealed iron chest?",
  "33861": "Shall I put a little more tea in the pot afore I go, ma'am?",
  "33862": "And what can you conceive more deadly?",
  "33863": "Why did you do it?",
  "33864": "What does she want?",
  "33865": "How do you know about it, and who are you, anyhow?",
  "33866": "What next?",
  "33867": "Deserted?",
  "33868": "When did you get in?",
  "33869": "Will it hit us?",
  "33870": "Do you want to be doing the same?",
  "33871": "Who will bring us bread?",
  "33872": "My friend, what do you tell me?",
  "33873": "Their whistle?",
  "33874": "Where in the world did you get that song?",
  "33875": "Is he very clever?",
  "33876": "Who did I get the statues from?",
  "33877": "Will you have some whiskey and water?",
  "33878": "What news?",
  "33879": "Struck me?",
  "33880": "And you are up?",

  "33885": "What two lines?",
  "33886": "At twenty minutes to nine?",
  "33887": "Whom have I to love?",
  "33888": "And the rocks with their various strata?",

  "33898": "You call them that, too?",
  "33899": "But by what means?",
  "33900": "Not come yet?",
  "33901": "Ever hear of lones the packer, hey, ole chappie?",
  "33902": "Is it quite original?",
  "33903": "Did he do that?",
  "33904": "Why should he trust himself to a balloon, that would blaze up like a piece of paper?",
  "33905": "You saw it?",
  "33906": "Like him?",
  "33907": "Would you take a seat, sir?",
  "33908": "And yet what else am I to do?",
  "33909": "Well, have you heard from your husband lately, my dear?",
  "33910": "You refused him?",
  "33911": "How did you know that?",
  "33912": "Can she make your real flecky paste, as melts in your mouth, and lies all up like a puff?",
  "33913": "Yes, what is it?",
  "33914": "Should he stay at home with her, her mother and her sisters?",
  "33915": "What can I do to prevent it?",
  "33916": "Have been brought together, eh?",
  "33917": "Would you like to come up and see her?",
  "33918": "What would you like to do tomorrow?",
  "33919": "Will that arrangement suit you?",
  "33920": "And you shall be included in it, in our happiness, do you hear, father?",

  "33924": "Water to drink?",
  "33925": "You will not serve me, sir, will you?",
  "33926": "How should he be?",
  "33927": "Again, has he greater experience of the pleasures of honour, or the lover of honour of the pleasures of wisdom?",
  "33928": "Is it nothing to hold one's peace?",
  "33929": "And you can do nothing until then?",
  "33930": "When, where?",
  "33931": "Is there generally?",
  "33932": "Yes, but still all this has to be looked after, and who is there to look after it?",
  "33933": "How much will you give me for it?",
  "33934": "What have I to say to them?",
  "33935": "When are you coming back?",
  "33936": "Can anyone be surprised if one gets fond of such a ship?",
  "33937": "Oh, not her?",
  "33938": "If the loyal people united were put to the utmost of their strength by the rebellion, must they not fail when divided and partially paralyzed by a political war among themselves?",
  "33939": "But what is worship?",
  "33940": "Why do you not speak to me?",
  "33941": "In arms against me?",
  "33942": "Do you wish for a proof?",
  "33943": "Where, then?",
  "33944": "Prove?",
  "33945": "Little woman?",

  "33953": "Tony, where are you going, my charmer?",
  "33954": "What does this tell us?",
  "33955": "How does she use you?",
  "33956": "Have you nothing else to ask him, sir?",
  "33957": "In the nick of time?",
  "33958": "How?",
  "33959": "Mind it?",
  "33960": "How can I help myself?",
  "33961": "Where has he gone?",
  "33962": "That visit not succeeding either, you will go again perhaps?",
  "33963": "Husband, are you as kind and gentle toward your wife as you should be?",
  "33964": "For what is death?",
  "33965": "If I see, clearly see, that ladder leading from plant to man, why should I suppose it breaks off at me and does not go farther and farther?",
  "33966": "Lively?",
  "33967": "Another glass?",
  "33968": "But the great point is, is there a 'Rita' on the list?",
  "33969": "Why should he not try rather to fortify himself, to add to his courtiers, to continually obtain new subsidies, and finally to free himself from dependence on the people, the inevitable goal of all power originating in the people?",
  "33970": "What was the difference whether the alms were given into my hands or into my wife's?",
  "33971": "Do you tell me that the woman is dead?",
  "33972": "Did he take that medicine, men?",
  "33973": "Who would suppose it?",
  "33974": "When was that done which settled the matter?",
  "33975": "What did you say, sir?",
  "33976": "Well and what am I to do now?",
  "33977": "What would be the result of a total extraction of the nitrogen?",
  "33978": "Do you not suspect?",
  "33979": "Did it keep you awake?",
  "33980": "Need any help, officer?",
  "33981": "What's the row now?",
  "33982": "Why are you so bad?",

  "33984": "Could I ever have believed then that I could come to such humiliation?",
  "33985": "Do you belong to the nobility?",
  "33986": "D'you think they care for us?",
  "33987": "You bring me great news, then, monsieur?",
  "33988": "Did I say above, or seem to imply, that the judge sometimes spoke harshly to his wife?",
  "33989": "Not in health?",
  "33990": "And we have admitted that justice is the excellence of the soul, and injustice the defect of the soul?",
  "33991": "Did you really?",
  "33992": "What was he doing?",
  "33993": "Is he out of his senses?",
  "33994": "Who then?",
  "33995": "Why do I feel so inclined to tease him?",
  "33996": "What monstrous place is this?",
  "33997": "Where is the use of our reckoning?",
  "33998": "You are AFRAID of it?",
  "33999": "Where is the prisoner?",
  "34000": "Is he generally liked?",

  "34002": "So soon?",
  "34003": "Genius, or insanity, who can say?",
  "34004": "Will not the guardians be the smallest of all the classes who receive a name from the profession of some kind of knowledge?",
  "34005": "A telegram?",
  "34006": "That's the boy, is it?",
  "34007": "At whose house?",

  "34009": "Which of them do you call her best friend?",
  "34010": "Is sugar always to be produced by vital blood?",
  "34011": "Was it a fear that he should deliver this name to the hazards of another memory than his own?",
  "34012": "You think it's certain he's there?",
  "34013": "Would they not have been as unwilling to part with them as with gold, and have compelled them to stay at home with them?",
  "34014": "Who did you pass on the road?",
  "34015": "What could she do but sob?",
  "34016": "What was that you told me before we left the old house?",
  "34017": "Beautiful and lusty?",
  "34018": "And is not the soul almost or altogether indissoluble?",
  "34019": "Buried amongst them, what met my eye?",
  "34020": "What is the matter with him?",
  "34021": "Might he not well inform the doctor that he had something to tell him for his advantage?",
  "34022": "But how can we gain your freedom?",
  "34023": "Or is this a subject in which new discoveries can be made?",
  "34024": "Has he got to be harnessed up and driven through life like a horse?",
  "34025": "What to do with him?",
  "34026": "Assuming also, again I say, that physical obstacles can be overcome, is not the time opportune for making a start?",
  "34027": "Why should it?",
  "34028": "Are you badly hurt?",
  "34029": "Has he many men, then?",
  "34030": "Will there be mercy for me there?",
  "34031": "I hope your father is well?",
  "34032": "Why then am I dissatisfied if I am going to do the things for which I exist and for which I was brought into the world?",
  "34033": "I tell you?",
  "34034": "You are no longer my father?",
  "34035": "And why, my young friend?",
  "34036": "If we were jurymen, what would we do with this parricide?",
  "34037": "What did they do it for then?",
  "34038": "Can you rely on his word?",
  "34039": "Why the coal country?",
  "34040": "Is that possible?",
  "34041": "What the prime cause of all my woe doth prove?",
  "34042": "Well, brigadier, what is he charged with?",
  "34043": "Look here, what does this mean?",
  "34044": "Liver?",
  "34045": "Will you not speak to them?",
  "34046": "Why, who are you, bold fellow, to range so boldly here?",
  "34047": "You want to speak to me, do you?",
  "34048": "And where is the wounded officer?",
  "34049": "And afterwards?",
  "34050": "What is your illustration?",
  "34051": "He has still hope, but what is it he hopes?",
  "34052": "In a tree?",
  "34053": "The question is, whether it procures most pain or pleasure?",
  "34054": "What's the matter with your legs?",
  "34055": "Who says that?",
  "34056": "How can I play a trick on a monkey?",
  "34057": "What kind of a bird is he?",
  "34058": "But how did you come here?",
  "34059": "Then it is settled?",
  "34060": "Where am I to die?",
  "34061": "What ought to be done?",
  "34062": "How now?",
  "34063": "But will you tell me?",
  "34064": "And do the enchanted sleep, now, senor?",
  "34065": "Is there anything else you would like?",
  "34066": "And you DO think something better of me than you did?",
  "34067": "Shall I not visit for these things?",
  "34068": "And how did it go so fast, so straight ahead, with such staring, staring eyes?",
  "34069": "Should I have to hand over?",
  "34070": "Do they love?",
  "34071": "What should be done with the elephant, which had been so dearly purchased?",
  "34072": "Was he not handsome?",
  "34073": "In making him a duke?",
  "34074": "How can you dare to speak to me like that?",
  "34075": "Whose was it?",
  "34076": "How did I lose her?",
  "34077": "Well, and what did the lady do?",
  "34078": "This has been done so often, and what good has ever come from it?",
  "34079": "Where do the lord and lady sleep?",
  "34080": "But whither am I wandering?",
  "34081": "With what kind of order?",
  "34082": "Why, then, refuse to follow to the end the road opened by science, and to admit an hypothesis which is the inevitable result of experience itself?",
  "34083": "But do you think we shall find the count at home?",
  "34084": "And what I am, to you my friends, now am I not?",
  "34085": "Do you conceive any thing but merely that perception?",
  "34086": "Who are these men you have brought before us?",
  "34087": "Some one holds you in restraint?",
  "34088": "Did you think he came directly from town?",
  "34089": "Will you breakfast with me tomorrow morning?",
  "34090": "Dearest, what?",
  "34091": "What's the news?",
  "34092": "And had you made up your mind what to say to him?",
  "34093": "Is not the president's shoulder still bleeding from the blow it has received?",
  "34094": "Wiggins?",
  "34095": "Oh, when are you going?",
  "34096": "Why should I care?",
  "34097": "What could you do for a boy like that?",
  "34098": "Does it think?",
  "34099": "Why should we ask what comes after the experience, when the experience is still unknown to us?",
  "34100": "Was he not the prince of men?",
  "34101": "Are not these dread words for a nation bearing in her bosom so mighty an injustice?",
  "34102": "What has happened?",
  "34103": "On what days?",
  "34104": "Or what hopes have we of deliverance by thus continuing faithful to such wicked wretches?",
  "34105": "Who's accused you?",
  "34106": "What's one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one?",
  "34107": "But the question again recurs, upon what pretense could he be put in possession of a force of that magnitude in time of peace?",
  "34108": "What can I do for the son?",
  "34109": "What, after the last?",
  "34110": "That I might lose them?",
  "34111": "Who is my mother?",
  "34112": "Why not let me send for this pleasant lady?",
  "34113": "Where have you come from?",
  "34114": "Will somebody obleege me with a spittoon?",
  "34115": "Do you think it is a wig?",
  "34116": "You sat in front of his writing desk?",
  "34117": "Had she no tears for the rough friend who laughed at the silk shoes, and taught her how to hold the reins and never fear that the old pony would run away with her?",
  "34118": "Where could my uncle be at that moment?",
  "34119": "Does he not want anything else?",
  "34120": "Why should I guard me?",
  "34121": "What am I to say or to do to make you understand that my only idea of happiness is the idea that sooner or later I may get you to be my wife?",
  "34122": "Why did he not tell it?",
  "34123": "What was the reply?",
  "34124": "Did business men commonly go into an expenditure of money which could be of no account to them?",
  "34125": "And then, in the next place, was it probable that the dean would act upon such a letter by filling up the vacancy, even if he did get it?",
  "34126": "And if not, WHO IS IN THE ROOM besides you and me?",
  "34127": "Must it of necessity be admitted that this power is infringed, so long as a part of the old articles remain?",
  "34128": "Had any papers been handed about among them, similar to these lists?",
  "34129": "Shall I go?",
  "34130": "On what charge do you expect to be arrested?",
  "34131": "But what can we expect from a turnip?",
  "34132": "And what am I now?",
  "34133": "A widow, ma'am?",
  "34134": "Well, what happened when you did get there?",
  "34135": "You say two faces were familiar to you?",
  "34136": "You opened the letter?",
  "34137": "But what are all these birds doing in heaven?",
  "34138": "Is this, also, some enchanted person?",
  "34139": "But what was it?",
  "34140": "I mean to say, what?",
  "34141": "Ha, friend?",
  "34142": "And what about his wife and family?",
  "34143": "Is it necessary that a bourgeoisie which stands in such need of you should disown you?",
  "34144": "Suppose he were taken prisoner again?",
  "34145": "Now, my good fellow, how are you?",
  "34146": "She was about to say?",
  "34147": "Do you have a teaching?",
  "34148": "Has labor, once so fecund, likewise become sterile?",
  "34149": "Then what do you talk of?",
  "34150": "A signal for others?",
  "34151": "Who, and what are you?",
  "34152": "What then is that which is able to conduct a man?",
  "34153": "Well, what are these buildings?",
  "34154": "What does he want to go out for again?",
  "34155": "You know that great pause that comes upon things before the dusk?",
  "34156": "You wish me, then, to relate the history of my past sorrows?",
  "34157": "What the charm that floats the bowl?",
  "34158": "When did that happen?",
  "34159": "Are you sure they can be relied on?",
  "34160": "What will come of it all?",
  "34161": "Was there any mention made of my uncle or me?",
  "34162": "In what does it consist?",
  "34163": "Then I am not to be allowed to have anything to do with it officially?",
  "34164": "Can I go, can I go?",
  "34165": "Is she a friend of yours?",
  "34166": "Or will you be my friend, as you have been hitherto, and do what I request?",
  "34167": "Do you mean it?",
  "34168": "What is that queer concern going down the river?",
  "34169": "Was that all she said I said?",
  "34170": "But how cast off all the superfluous, devilish burden of my outer man?",
  "34171": "Why then is that rather a misfortune than this a good fortune?",
  "34172": "There now, what is it?",
  "34173": "Anything in the gruff and grumble way?",
  "34174": "Oh, my father, must your past career always interfere with my successes?",
  "34175": "Have I furnished it nicely?",
  "34176": "What am I doing here, anyway?",
  "34177": "From what causes do I derive my existence, and to what condition shall I return?",
  "34178": "Who put that paper there?",
  "34179": "Will you tell me what you're going to do with the skin?",
  "34180": "Do you suppose I am going to bring my ropes, my windlass, and set it up, and go down there with my boy and let myself be bitten, perhaps, by your cursed dog for the pleasure of giving it back to you?",
  "34181": "What will you do, then?",
  "34182": "What sort of a life could we build on such foundations?",
  "34183": "Ay, said I, but who can help constitution?",
  "34184": "Not chilled, pet, are you?",
  "34185": "Gone?",
  "34186": "Where had you seen me before?",
  "34187": "And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a fait accompli?",
  "34188": "And to sign the contract in three days?",
  "34189": "And that is your opinion?",
  "34190": "Can one?",
  "34191": "Was it wonderful that I was misanthropic and sullen?",
  "34192": "Who compels me to this?",
  "34193": "What had she done?",
  "34194": "Do you love him?",
  "34195": "Not even by lightening it, as they lighten an overloaded vessel?",
  "34196": "Is there any other witness?",
  "34197": "Do you think I am so poor and short of clothes, or that I have so few cloaks and as to be unable to find comfortable beds both for myself and for my guests?",
  "34198": "Meg, shall we ever learn to talk less?",
  "34199": "What then, when that's once done?",
  "34200": "Then why did you come here, my dear?",
  "34201": "Why should my courtesie to these knights go all for naught?",
  "34202": "Was I, then, a monster, a blot upon the earth, from which all men fled and whom all men disowned?",
  "34203": "Could the latter for a moment suppose that the son would not offer the best part to the father?",
  "34204": "Why should she be sorry?",
  "34205": "Who, then, has counselled you to take this step, one for which the court is deeply indebted to you, and which is perfectly natural, considering your birth and your misfortunes?",
  "34206": "And so?",
  "34207": "Seek introductions, draw petitions up?",
  "34208": "How do we know what is at the bottom of his sudden interest in you?",
  "34209": "Wherefore?",
  "34210": "How do you account for this?",
  "34211": "And on what occasions have such favors been bestowed upon you?",
  "34212": "Do you think that will be really necessary?",
  "34213": "Any other letters?",
  "34214": "And where the prudence now that awed mankind?",
  "34215": "What will the ladies take for breakfast?",
  "34216": "Where did you learn how I speak of others?",
  "34217": "Does it hurt you so much?",
  "34218": "You are not angry with me?",
  "34219": "What if her interest in him were not so entirely that of a relative as it had formerly been?",
  "34220": "Did you see them off, before you came away?",
  "34221": "What on earth are we to do with him?",
  "34222": "Does it consist in the greater security afforded by a greater variety of parties, against the event of any one party being able to outnumber and oppress the rest?",
  "34223": "Should you like to sleep?",
  "34224": "Why, it may be asked, has the supposed creative force produced bats and no other mammals on remote islands?",
  "34225": "Should he not have a regard for his health and efficiency?",
  "34226": "Shall I tell you each ornament of your toilet?",
  "34227": "How does he get it, then?",
  "34228": "Can it be believed that they would thus act to no purpose during their courtship?",
  "34229": "How know you this man has?",
  "34230": "And as it is to so go at all events, may we not agree that the sooner the better?",
  "34231": "Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?",
  "34232": "And why were you not willing?",
  "34233": "Are you so and so?",
  "34234": "May I suppose that you have this distinction of the visible and intelligible fixed in your mind?",
  "34235": "What's the good of getting away?",
  "34236": "Is it not adherence to the old and tried, against the new and untried?",

  "35008": "When did you first notice it?",
  "35009": "Do you see now how very far it is?",
  "35010": "How is their motion?",
  "35011": "Whom I did yearn to see?",
  "35012": "What did she say to him, my man?",
  "35013": "Does it seem strange to you that this should be the conclusion of the argument I have just addressed to you?",
  "35014": "What are those?",
  "35015": "Do you suppose I dread any change of that sort?",
  "35016": "And who is her maid?",
  "35017": "Is this not contrary to fact?",
  "35018": "And who was he?",
  "35019": "Am I not he who must not take up arms for a year?",
  "35020": "And what will happen when we die?",
  "35021": "You had abandoned all hope of being dug out?",
  "35022": "What have I done, sir, to deserve it should be otherwise?",
  "35023": "How many of you have surreptitious milliners' bills?",
  "35024": "What did he do with these riches of time?",
  "35025": "Should he dash down the one or allow the other to fall?",
  "35026": "You know the ragouts I can throw together?",
  "35027": "Why did they envy him her?",
  "35028": "How can people be so common as to go running after them?",
  "35029": "You have a daughter, then, madame?",
  "35030": "Speak if you dare, and tell me, what is the presentiment?",
  "35031": "Would she not prefer to espouse death itself rather than that living corpse?",
  "35032": "What would I do if I was in your case?",
  "35033": "If you act thus in the green leaf, what will you do in the dry?",
  "35034": "Solitary as their lives were, is there no one person who would serve my purpose?",
  "35035": "Can he learn economy or statesmanship from a grin?",
  "35036": "What is this?",
  "35037": "How am I to respect you, if that's the case?",

  "35045": "So early?",
  "35046": "Lawful heart, did any one ever see such freckles?",
  "35047": "You have worked on this alone?",
  "35048": "But what can I do for you?",

  "35056": "Who could refuse him?",
  "35057": "Anybody been here, sir?",
  "35058": "How deeply did they wound me when they deprived me of your friendship?",
  "35059": "You had never anything to complain of?",
  "35060": "You got anything to play music on?",
  "35061": "And the writing?",
  "35062": "So you shun me?",
  "35063": "How do you find yourself, sir?",
  "35064": "My husband is asleep, why do you come to disturb his glorious rest?",
  "35065": "No scarves?",
  "35066": "Tom, what's the matter?",
  "35067": "What is peace?",
  "35068": "Nothing broken?",
  "35069": "Why afraid?",
  "35070": "It was not as she said?",

  "35073": "Is she asleep?",
  "35074": "How many roubles do you want?",
  "35075": "You saw him, sir?",
  "35076": "Who has taken my piece of glass?",
  "35077": "Whom have we here?",
  "35078": "What are you in for?",
  "35079": "Where is the boy?",
  "35080": "What end?",
  "35081": "What is he now?",
  "35082": "Now is that true or not?",
  "35083": "In what way, sir?",
  "35084": "What could be more natural than his asking you again?",
  "35085": "A hartles man, and liue?",
  "35086": "Did you not know I should follow you?",
  "35087": "What does he want?",
  "35088": "Do you understand it now?",
  "35089": "But what does it matter to me that it is inconsistent?",
  "35090": "You which?",
  "35091": "What battle does it represent?",
  "35092": "You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?",
  "35093": "What, me?",
  "35094": "What is that light?",
  "35095": "And all that?",
  "35096": "Is there any secret meaning concealed beneath your words?",
  "35097": "For a time, you mean?",
  "35098": "Have I been false to her, through strict fidelity to you, and sacrificed my friendship to keep my love inviolate?",
  "35099": "Why do I connect it with dumbbells?",
  "35100": "WORK?",
  "35101": "What's all this?",
  "35102": "Have you not perceived it?",
  "35103": "A pupil?",
  "35104": "Is it really true?",
  "35105": "But if your husband is alive and able to write letters, why should he remain away from you?",
  "35106": "Is there no way of communicating with them?",
  "35107": "Did you ever hear of such a thing?",
  "35108": "How can I here speak of the beginning of action?",
  "35109": "Then how did he get in?",
  "35110": "Estella who?",
  "35111": "Would you mind telling me what you'd say?",
  "35112": "See that fire?",
  "35113": "And supposing you had succeeded?",
  "35114": "I suppose the local investigation was relaxed while this false clue was being followed up?",
  "35115": "You say that the fault was all yours?",
  "35116": "Back in a minute?",
  "35117": "And you, are you one of the doctors?",
  "35118": "You are not hurt?",
  "35119": "What do you do, going to my chest?",
  "35120": "Did you correspond with him?",
  "35121": "Well, YOU will not be going that way, I suppose?",
  "35122": "What worries you?",
  "35123": "For with what confidence can I venture upon such bold enterprises, when beside those numberless infirmities peculiar to myself, I find so many which are common to human nature?",
  "35124": "Early t'night, lass?",
  "35125": "Why had they stopped in that strange place?",
  "35126": "But, sir, of writers?",
  "35127": "Well, then, what are you willing to rent the land at?",
  "35128": "Shall I tell it to you?",
  "35129": "Will she not be here anon ?",
  "35130": "And what is the other question of difference now?",
  "35131": "And do the enchanted eat?",
  "35132": "What have I done wrong now?",
  "35133": "You are going to dine?",
  "35134": "It may be asked, perhaps, what has so long kept this disjointed machine from falling entirely to pieces?",
  "35135": "Why not do it?",
  "35136": "What does it matter if your picture is good or bad?",
  "35137": "What, then, have I to fear from him?",
  "35138": "Where's the creature's abominable father?",
  "35139": "Do you wish to know what is known of her?",
  "35140": "Is this he?",
  "35141": "When is it to be?",
  "35142": "Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it?",
  "35143": "On the bridge?",
  "35144": "And you've no doubt what you shall do, if they come?",
  "35145": "So uncivilized?",
  "35146": "Have we no tendency to the latter condition?",
  "35147": "See thot?",
  "35148": "Shall I now accept his perfidious friendship?",
  "35149": "Now then, what do you say to that?",
  "35150": "Who, I, sir?",
  "35151": "What is there in the language of that speech which expresses such purpose or bears such construction?",
  "35152": "But perhaps you can never believe, now, that there is anything human in my heart?",
  "35153": "WHY are you?",
  "35154": "Consumption, was it?",
  "35155": "Where is he to be found?",
  "35156": "I knew that, did I?",
  "35157": "Could you run a hotel in the city?",
  "35158": "Will I?",
  "35159": "In order to spare your tears am I to commit these crimes?",
  "35160": "Why is it necessary to imprison me, to convince me of it?",
  "35161": "Whereas the bad and ignorant will desire to gain more than both?",
  "35162": "Have I understood you rightly?",
  "35163": "Tell me, could you think any thing less?",
  "35164": "For how many causes may a man be divorced, nephew?",
  "35165": "Have you come to me at such an early morning hour?",
  "35166": "You will not exclude me from your confidence if you admit me to your heart?",
  "35167": "As long as he has liquor and good pay, why should he ask questions?",
  "35168": "How long was it before you went to bed?",
  "35169": "Oh, you in front, what is blocking the way?",
  "35170": "He started by and by as if he were just then awakened, and asked who that was, and what was the matter?",
  "35171": "What are all the records of history, but narratives of successive villanies, of treasons and usurpations, massacres and wars?",
  "35172": "But how, sir, shall we dispose of you?",
  "35173": "All ready there, forward?",
  "35174": "That he may be ready?",
  "35175": "What would?",
  "35176": "Do I?",
  "35177": "What happened next?",
  "35178": "Well, what is your opinion?",
  "35179": "Or, in spite of the opinion of the many, and in spite of consequences whether better or worse, shall we insist on the truth of what was then said, that injustice is always an evil and dishonour to him who acts unjustly?",
  "35180": "If all the drops in it were dried up, what would become of the sea?",
  "35181": "Have you not yet divined who he is?",
  "35182": "Do you know the condition I am in?",
  "35183": "Would the two, for his enlightenment, try to ascertain just what they had in common, and why they belonged to the same party?",
  "35184": "Should you go on that plan?",
  "35185": "If this development is equal, how is the power of reproduction lessened?",
  "35186": "It is in this direction, and I could come any afternoon by train for half an hour?",
  "35187": "Had he been indeed a man meanly jealous of fame, and capable of stooping to base and wicked arts for the purpose of injuring his competitors, would his vices have remained latent so long?",
  "35188": "Then why should I not go to his chambers?",
  "35189": "What do you want here?",
  "35190": "Why lie sprawling about the deck like this?",
  "35191": "By what authority?",
  "35192": "Who's a going to try?",
  "35193": "You know no good of the fellow?",
  "35194": "But after all, why not?",
  "35195": "You would not be very angry, would you?",
  "35196": "No accident, I hope?",
  "35197": "And educated?",
  "35198": "My lord?",
  "35199": "But who was the cause of my doing so?",
  "35200": "Why should I go back?",
  "35201": "As for you, what have you done of those things that are recommended by our legislator?",
  "35202": "How else might all be so distressed?",
  "35203": "Is there anything on the face of the earth that a man can do to make you happier than you are at present?",
  "35204": "Who are you, and what do you want?",
  "35205": "Are they alive now?",
  "35206": "Was he planning some daring, impossible, mad attempt to repulse the infuriated horde?",
  "35207": "Would you like to lie down a little while?",
  "35208": "Were you there, then?",
  "35209": "Alone?",
  "35210": "The mistake arose out of my card, did it?",
  "35211": "How would you like to work for me?",
  "35212": "Pray, are you aware that the king has no money in his treasury?",
  "35213": "I, indeed?",
  "35214": "Gedge?",
  "35215": "What things?",
  "35216": "Is the king dead?",
  "35217": "And why did I do it, I should like to know?",
  "35218": "But wherefore sit I in a regall throne?",
  "35219": "Are you not astonished at the wall being completed so quickly?",
  "35220": "What makes, what is it doing?",
  "35221": "Where did he lodge?",
  "35222": "What is your purpose?",
  "35223": "Could we call our knowledge of the laws of gravitation for instance, knowledge of the past?",
  "35224": "Is it my darlings' weeping that I hear?",
  "35225": "Where can he be?",
  "35226": "Is it meant that we are not ready upon brief notice to put a nation in the field, a nation of men trained to arms?",
  "35227": "What in glory has you here at this hour of day?",
  "35228": "Or show you restless, miswandering, misclimbing ones new and easier footpaths?",
  "35229": "Who do YOU like best?",
  "35230": "To you first entering on life, to whom care is new and agony unknown, how can you understand what I have felt and still feel?",
  "35231": "And how does he live, in happiness or in misery?",
  "35232": "Do you beat your father?",
  "35233": "What then is left?",
  "35234": "Whose, ma'am?",
  "35235": "Who ever heard of such an idea?",
  "35236": "How match the bards whom none e'er matched before?",
  "35237": "But, sire, how can you?",
  "35238": "And they will be rich and elegant?",
  "35239": "The boat of the DAY DREAM?",
  "35240": "What course is this you speak of, and impelled by whom, sir?",
  "35241": "Do you mark, sir?",
  "35242": "Are you still aware what you have sworn to me?",
  "35243": "Why, where are your things?",
  "35244": "And this elixir, where is it?",
  "35245": "But what reason has she for being angry?",
  "35246": "What should ail me to harm this misbegotten and miserable babe?",
  "35247": "And he bowed to you like this?",
  "35248": "But what of the resemblance?",
  "35249": "Was it good for you?",
  "35250": "Where do you suppose she's gone to?",
  "35251": "No, no?",
  "35252": "Could you not utter one squeak in your own defence?",
  "35253": "So correspondent to the bearer's state?",
  "35254": "You're not going anywhere in particular, are you?",
  "35255": "How few authors or artists have arrived at eminence who have not lived by their employment?",
  "35256": "That'll fetch her, I think, eh?",
  "35257": "Are your eyes troubling you?",
  "35258": "Why did we not find it sooner?",
  "35259": "A book in the library?",
  "35260": "Dare devil that you are, full of guile, unwearying in deceit, can you not drop your tricks and your instinctive falsehood, even now that you are in your own country again?",
  "35261": "Where do you live, young maid?",
  "35262": "Why not you step out of the narrow circle which, as I have shown, is all of noble life your laws and customs allow?",
  "35263": "Which way should I turn?",
  "35264": "Who else could hold you thus?",
  "35265": "What tricks?",
  "35266": "If they did happen, is it reasonable to suppose that you will make yourselves and others more happy by one course of conduct or by another?",
  "35267": "What do they say of him?",
  "35268": "And how runs this maxim?",
  "35269": "How could I draw back, and how could I confess?",
  "35270": "Is there a row about me?",
  "35271": "Why should there be sin?",
  "35272": "Has she been very ill?",
  "35273": "Where but from the oar with which so long he fought the sea?",
  "35274": "When did you get drunk last?",
  "35275": "Who are you at all?",
  "35276": "Then you abandon me, doctor?",
  "35277": "Does he like the trade?",
  "35278": "And why at all, since it is the custom to pay revenue to the king?",
  "35279": "Will you dine here?",
  "35280": "Good heavens, gentlemen, what sort of free will is left when we come to tabulation and arithmetic, when it will all be a case of twice two make four?",
  "35281": "Could I abandon the unhappy subjects intrusted to my care?",
  "35282": "And the end or use of a horse or of anything would be that which could not be accomplished, or not so well accomplished, by any other thing?",
  "35283": "What shall I say to you?",
  "35284": "Notice your arm's sore?",
  "35285": "Then why flaunt yourself before this booby, as you have been doing?",
  "35286": "But how will you manage to get out?",
  "35287": "But why not both?",
  "35288": "BUT if objects for gratitude and admiration are our desire, do they not present themselves every hour to our eyes?",
  "35289": "And did she inform you what I went to do?",
  "35290": "And with what did you contrive to make that?",
  "35291": "But about the hospital, papa?",
  "35292": "But suppose he loses his seat?",
  "35293": "What?",
  "35294": "Why not advance science in its most difficult and vital aspect, the knowledge of the brain?",
  "35295": "And you, sir?",
  "35296": "Has it reference to what you said just now?",
  "35297": "Into what thicket?",
  "35298": "What would be a reward suitable to a poor man who is your benefactor, and who desires leisure that he may instruct you?",
  "35299": "Perhaps you were acquainted with somebody who was a party in something, ma'am?",
  "35300": "So you will then betray our love to him?",
  "35301": "The wind still sits in that quarter, does it?",
  "35302": "What did he?",
  "35303": "Want?",
  "35304": "Should you like eggs, sir?",
  "35305": "My brethren, wherefore is there need of the lion in the spirit?",
  "35306": "Does that question offend you?",
  "35307": "Has he got anything seriously the matter with him?",
  "35308": "Then why not make himself known at once?",
  "35309": "If he had liked his wife so much why did he hate her garden?",
  "35310": "Is it because LIBERTY implies it, or because property prohibits it?",
  "35311": "Have you quite forgot us poor critturs?",
  "35312": "Is it the old pain, my precious?",
  "35313": "And what is that?",
  "35314": "How does it stand now?",
  "35315": "In what respect?",
  "35316": "Cuthbert?",
  "35317": "Was this word needful?",
  "35318": "No doubt you think that very absurd?",

  "35323": "How should they carry its burden?",
  "35324": "What is it, madam?",
  "35325": "What's the matter with you, shipmate?",
  "35326": "He was very obliging, and as he handed me into a fly after superintending the removal of my boxes, I asked him whether there was a great fire anywhere?",
  "35327": "What on earth did you want to bring this one for?",
  "35328": "What on earth?",
  "35329": "But what was he doing, that he could not trouble to write?",
  "35330": "It was too warm in the room, was it not, count?",
  "35331": "What are you up to here?",
  "35332": "And why was that?",
  "35333": "I mean a way two horses and a van can travel over?",
  "35334": "Have they a party there?",
  "35335": "On the life before you, do you mean?",
  "35336": "Are you thinking of commissions in hand?",
  "35337": "Supposing, then, you get your hat and we both go?",
  "35338": "Where are the sentiments of my heart?",
  "35339": "Are there bears on your place?",
  "35340": "What have I said and what have I done?",
  "35341": "To whom was this addressed?",
  "35342": "Who knows him here?",
  "35343": "Who can forbid your indulgence in any whim?",
  "35344": "Has anything particular happened in the neighborhood?",
  "35345": "That is not quite so common, is it?",
  "35346": "But if we possessed this power, would it be wise to exercise it under existing circumstances?",
  "35347": "Has any one told you he means to make me one?",
  "35348": "What was his handwriting like?",
  "35349": "What do you think?",
  "35350": "Still?",
  "35351": "And with the hearing, I said, we hear, and with the other senses perceive the other objects of sense?",
  "35352": "You mean to say that the people, from whom he has derived his being, will maintain him and his companions?",
  "35353": "One a fat sleek man?",
  "35354": "But why?",
  "35355": "Now, how can an external intuition anterior to objects themselves, and in which our conception of objects can be determined a priori, exist in the human mind?",
  "35356": "Ah, go away, dummy, how about the girls?",
  "35357": "But what does the dazzling day to the south conceal?",
  "35358": "Or something of that sort?",
  "35359": "Since I've been away?",
  "35360": "What is to be done in such a case?",
  "35361": "How did you do it?",
  "35362": "Is it he?",
  "35363": "Where are they, sweetheart?",
  "35364": "Did you have a good time last night?",
  "35365": "Does he not work his will harmfully as well as in love by agencies?",

  "35367": "How long are you going to wait?",
  "35368": "What if some volcanic burst should one day raise these two barriers above the waves?",
  "35369": "He loves me, but how?",
  "35370": "What do I live for?",
  "35371": "And by what means could it be achieved?",
  "35372": "And who are they?",
  "35373": "But would you ruin me?",
  "35374": "Why have you taken off your mask?",
  "35375": "Mamma, how did papa make you an offer?",
  "35376": "Will you not tell me of my husband?",
  "35377": "See anything?",
  "35378": "Ah, and you have not?",
  "35379": "Must one first batter their ears, that they may learn to hear with their eyes?",
  "35380": "Have you ever betrayed to him so much, as a syllable of that which stirs our hearts?",
  "35381": "What will the country say?",
  "35382": "Tess, you wonder why I have followed you?",
  "35383": "Could one, with any feeling, live as he is living with me?",
  "35384": "Do you believe in apparitions?",
  "35385": "Where were the oars?",
  "35386": "Do you know where you saw it afore?",

  "35799": "The question, then, is, ought we to respect the incognito of this generous being, or ought we to do everything to find him out?",
  "35800": "What do you suppose was the worth of them clothes you had?",
  "35801": "And what am I to do there?",
  "35802": "To propose it?",
  "35803": "August ?",

  "35819": "So you found him at the church?",
  "35820": "Ah, it is really a serious matter, then?",
  "35821": "Did these very late interlopers, down to the sixth century, introduce modern details into the picture of life?",

  "35841": "Charles says do you want the TIMES?",
  "35842": "Would it become him humbly to sue to her for pardon?",
  "35843": "And what is your estimate of those you see around me?",
  "35844": "Were you about to start?",

  "36968": "Why had no word of any kind come from him?",
  "36969": "Made by whom?",
  "36970": "Have blows passed?",
  "36971": "And why was I so furious about it?",
  "36972": "Now, who was that someone?",
  "36973": "Who told you so?",
  "36974": "How long is this thing going on like this?",
  "36975": "How much did it cost him?",
  "36976": "How are we today?",
  "36977": "Need I recall either the scene or the national circumstances attending the occasion?",
  "36978": "You're ready, are you?",
  "36979": "Of whom speak you?",
  "36980": "Do you know?",
  "36981": "What am I saying?",
  "36982": "Might not that influence be altogether disastrous?",
  "36983": "What shall I say of this man?",
  "36984": "Is it not the impiety of the inhabitants?",
  "36985": "Was he carrying a hat?",
  "36986": "And the lustful and tyrannical desires are, as we saw, at the greatest distance?",
  "36987": "Who's there?",
  "36988": "When do you desire to go?",
  "36989": "The associate?",
  "36990": "But to whom, then?",
  "36991": "You feel strong enough to walk a little way now?",
  "36992": "What odds in that?",
  "36993": "And do you imagine he realizes all the awfulness of my position?",
  "36994": "Is the world, then, so narrow?",
  "36995": "When did music come this way?",
  "36996": "And what means have you to suggest, may I ask?",
  "36997": "What have we here?",
  "36998": "A spy?",
  "36999": "What are you worrying for, so long as he has money?",
  "37000": "Why did you ask me?",
  "37001": "What did these sealed mysterious letters bring him?",
  "37002": "How long will it take you to make up your mind?",
  "37003": "How of the window?",
  "37004": "And what did she for you?",
  "37005": "Well, how is your district council doing?",
  "37006": "Ought we not, then, to put our virtue and fortitude to the severest tests?",
  "37007": "May you come to me?",
  "37008": "What was his affair?",
  "37009": "Are you a magician?",
  "37010": "How long is it?",
  "37011": "Should you think all that pleasant enough if I forgave you?",
  "37012": "Were not these madmen common enough in such a prison?",
  "37013": "Of HIM?",
  "37014": "Is he hurt badly?",
  "37015": "What the devil is it all about?",
  "37016": "Does he now say that he did not make that promise?",
  "37017": "What was his name?",

  "37020": "Is it true, mother?",
  "37021": "Whither?",
  "37022": "Shall I open the secretary?",
  "37023": "In what respect, madame?",
  "37024": "But what is an energumen?",
  "37025": "Who is it bids me hold?",
  "37026": "May I ask where you have taken up your quarters?",
  "37027": "Or, indeed, I might perhaps get a clerkship in a merchant's office?",
  "37028": "Are you a merchant?",
  "37029": "What injury?",

  "37032": "Where did you get THAT idea from?",
  "37033": "Have you ever seen a man hanged?",
  "37034": "Not even your aunt?",
  "37035": "How would it be possible to explain all this to a judge and jury, so that they might neither say that he was dishonest, nor yet that he was mad?",
  "37036": "Why did you not tell me?",
  "37037": "Do you recall her features distinctly?",
  "37038": "At such a tender age could he have been conscious of his uncle's superiority to all those who surrounded him?",
  "37039": "She had a son, that unhappy woman?",
  "37040": "What was the occasion of this excited assemblage?",
  "37041": "But at a tremendous discount, of course?",
  "37042": "You wish to speak to me about the circumstance which has just happened?",
  "37043": "Was I not just telling you I despised it?",
  "37044": "How has this been proved?",
  "37045": "Do you mind?",
  "37046": "What does it say?",
  "37047": "Then this table is free?",
  "37048": "Who raised the money?",
  "37049": "And what might you think?",
  "37050": "Perhaps you dislike it?",
  "37051": "You see all these bags at the back of my cart?",
  "37052": "Whether they were a rich or a poor corporation?",
  "37053": "And how does he behave towards travellers?",
  "37054": "Have you kept in touch with the market while you have been out of work?",
  "37055": "I then asked him what he intended to do with the knife which had been found upon him?",
  "37056": "Have you ever noticed how much a thing is heightened in value when we obtain possession of it?",
  "37057": "But why should he go through the ceremony if he is not to live with her?",
  "37058": "Oh, is that it?",
  "37059": "I do not know?",
  "37060": "And how could he know that I should be such a simpleton as to believe him?",
  "37061": "Are you so unsociable that you cannot make friends?",
  "37062": "Repeal this statute, my good sir?",
  "37063": "Will you make up your mind at last?",
  "37064": "Do I not know human nature?",
  "37065": "Must I wrap them up?",
  "37066": "If he was going to treat her like that why did he ask her to come and live at the flat?",
  "37067": "But how can I send him away, since I have given him a rendezvous?",
  "37068": "H'm?",
  "37069": "Ever so far?",
  "37070": "What are you doing there?",
  "37071": "And how have I broken that treaty, your excellency?",
  "37072": "How are you, old fellow?",
  "37073": "Sister?",
  "37074": "No misfortune has happened to the queen?",
  "37075": "You advise me, then, to be reconciled to the abbe?",
  "37076": "You too come to see them off?",
  "37077": "What is the meaning of yonder singular building?",
  "37078": "Have you brought his indentures with you?",
  "37079": "Is not ambition but an endless ladder by which no height is ever climbed till the last unreachable rung is mounted?",
  "37080": "Are you staying to talk?",
  "37081": "In what relation must she salute you as her uncle, or as her husband?",
  "37082": "Your crime?",
  "37083": "What have I been waiting for?",
  "37084": "Morrel?",
  "37085": "Or what does she mean?",
  "37086": "Has he got the financial basis arranged then?",
  "37087": "A little?",
  "37088": "Who goes there, yourselves?",
  "37089": "Will nothing of it remain?",
  "37090": "What will we get?",
  "37091": "But what's the use of talking of gorgeous rooms?",
  "37092": "Why did you sin?",
  "37093": "What necessity was there to expatiate on her brother's drunkenness?",
  "37094": "Could we lend you anything?",
  "37095": "I hope number two's as good?",
  "37096": "Are they weighing the shekels of the tabernacle ?",
  "37097": "Is it all past over?",
  "37098": "My heart, who is there upon earth that I could miss so much?",
  "37099": "If it is I you do love, O how can it be that you look and speak so?",
  "37100": "Shall I clamber across, or will you come to the plank above here?",
  "37101": "Have they calculated upon the inevitable consequences of this abdication?",
  "37102": "Plural?",
  "37103": "Why no king?",
  "37104": "Why had her family cast her off?",
  "37105": "And what will you do in that case?",
  "37106": "Why?",
  "37107": "Were they good to you?",
  "37108": "And why not?",
  "37109": "Whither shall I fly?",
  "37110": "Where is such an education as this to be had?",
  "37111": "Have you any more business here?",
  "37112": "You would follow the escort?",
  "37113": "Are you superhuman?",
  "37114": "But what good effect can the latter mode of worship have on the moral conduct of a rational being?",
  "37115": "Why, how, when my money is gone, my complexion gone, my life gone, and my slipper gone?",
  "37116": "Do we desire to make such ruthless combinations and monopolies lawful?",
  "37117": "Whose sword?",
  "37118": "There, do you hear?",
  "37119": "You do believe in my grandmother, then?",
  "37120": "Do you feel ill, sir?",
  "37121": "How did that ivory come all this way?",
  "37122": "Is there confusion in the little isle?",
  "37123": "What lay behind it or within it?",
  "37124": "Why have they not been here?",
  "37125": "But, doctor, you are not going to quarrel with us?",
  "37126": "What the devil are you driving at?",
  "37127": "When did it come to your knowledge?",
  "37128": "You do not comprehend ?",
  "37129": "Do you swear it?",
  "37130": "With your lasso you could stop an ox?",
  "37131": "Why, what do you call yourselves?",
  "37132": "And the corpse?",
  "37133": "You will give me your hand, will you not?",
  "37134": "Was it a girl or a boy?",
  "37135": "From whom?",
  "37136": "Why had she bidden him to come early if she was having people to dine?",
  "37137": "Was it yesterday?",
  "37138": "Shall I see something very uncommon?",
  "37139": "Could she see?",
  "37140": "Are those all they've left us?",
  "37141": "All?",
  "37142": "Where was now the dwarf?",
  "37143": "Was that so?",
  "37144": "What hideous, furtive hand is that which is slipped into the pocket of victory?",
  "37145": "Do you know who the other is?",
  "37146": "And does the essence of the invariable partake of knowledge in the same degree as of essence?",
  "37147": "Why will you ask me to do these things?",
  "37148": "With what view?",
  "37149": "What have you against me?",

  "37181": "What shall I do, mamma?",
  "37182": "What's all this about diamonds?",
  "37183": "Why did you come between my love and me?",
  "37184": "When such as I, who have no certain roof but the coffinlid, and no friend in sickness or death but the hospital nurse, set our rotten hearts on any man, and let him fill the place that has been a blank through all our wretched lives, who can hope to cure us?",

  "37198": "Why should they not do good?",
  "37199": "Where, then, lies the solution of the social problem?",
  "37200": "Then there is no cure for it?",

  "37232": "Steady?",
  "37233": "Was it natural, was it effort?",
  "37234": "Kin you keep awake that long?",
  "37235": "Now, does that signify a jot?",

  "37238": "Shall I strike that?",
  "37239": "When have you found me unmindful of your lessons?",
  "37240": "But I would ask you how did this man know that you lived here, or how to get into your house, or where to hide to get you?",
  "37241": "Did you forbid them to come?",
  "37242": "An old woman?",
  "37243": "And do you?",
  "37244": "You do not, I suppose, want our horses to clamber up on the roof of the carriage in front of us?",
  "37245": "Where has he gone?",
  "37246": "How much have you a year?",
  "37247": "You WILL put it to her yourself then?",

  "37260": "But had it been bad, why should we pronounce it dishonest?",
  "37261": "What do I lack in your eyes?",
  "37262": "Then what is the theory in your mind?",
  "37263": "Murderers of whom?",
  "37264": "To be put to death by mine own people, and render my memory a disgrace to my family and my nation?",
  "37265": "Why did she bear a grateful heart because they had met, and feel it pain to think that they would shortly part?",

  "37274": "How would fifty guineas for a night's work suit you?",
  "37275": "Could you tell her so for me, with my fervent acknowledgments?",
  "37276": "Have you no need of my services, sir?",
  "37277": "Are you also the victim of a treachery?",
  "37278": "Is any one hurt?",
  "37279": "Was there no possibility of sending to fetch him if it were only for an instant, or forwarding to him one line of writing to which he might return a verbal reply?",
  "37280": "What's the use of it?",
  "37281": "Do you think I should find it interesting?",

  "37450": "Was it well done, sir, if you're upon that subject, to deliver what I entrusted to yourself, to the care of another sir?",
  "37451": "Alas, was THIS perhaps the higher man whose cry I heard?",
  "37452": "Heah him crowin' now?",
  "37453": "But how did you find your way to me?",
  "37454": "And have no doubt searched all the huts until you came to this one?",

  "37482": "What, you are desirous of quitting my service, monsieur?",
  "37483": "But how can it be done?",
  "37484": "Now do you really imagine that I could have survived all these years, if I had led a public life, supposing that like a good man I had always maintained the right and had made justice, as I ought, the first thing?",

  "37535": "Who else could lay it there save you or me?",
  "37536": "Why would they not be gone?",
  "37537": "Or, after all, they may be in the right, and poets do really know the things about which they seem to the many to speak so well?",
  "37538": "But would any of your guardians think or speak of any other guardian as a stranger?",
  "37539": "Do you see here this little bunch, to which they are going to give t'other wrench?",
  "37540": "What do you know about it?",
  "37541": "Why, by your silence, have you unchained egoism within me?",
  "37542": "Then why are you so ruffled?",
  "37543": "And why no arrest?",
  "37544": "Is it becoming a philosopher to alter his method of reasoning, and run from one principle to its contrary, according to the particular phaenomenon, which he would explain?",
  "37545": "Where did you get that scratch?",
  "37546": "Should I, if I had a wife, suffer myself to be thus passionately carried to and fro with the stream of her humour, and neglect my deepest affairs, to serve her affections?",

  "37569": "Secondly, will not a movement of our army be a relief to the cavalry, compelling the enemy to concentrate instead of foraging in squads everywhere?",
  "37570": "Small, what will it be?",
  "37571": "What is going to happen?",
  "37572": "What did you come for?",
  "37573": "How long did the queen remain out of the chamber?",
  "37574": "Do you accept the bargain?",
  "37575": "And we have admitted, I said, that the good of each art is specially confined to the art?",

  "37609": "What did you talk about?",
  "37610": "Why does the king set me at liberty?",
  "37611": "Who is there so much his country's enemy, or so unmanly, and so desirous of living, as not to repent that he is still alive?",
  "37612": "You'll hev to wait till you see your pa to reward me, then?",
  "37613": "Your own ancestors were living here before that, I suppose?",
  "37614": "Did you give my note?",
  "37615": "Where's your curls, gal?",

  "37637": "Do you wish to hear what I have to say?",
  "37638": "Where the devil have the leg bands been shoved to?",
  "37639": "What became of them, deprived of the dear garden of former days, with its mazes, its odor of the past, and the graceful windings of its hedges?",
  "37640": "What be they?",
  "37641": "And as fickle?",
  "37642": "Do you know what that is?",
  "37643": "Was it indeed such spiritual guidance that was coming to me in my sleep?",
  "37644": "Are you going to spend your life saying ought, like the rest of our moralists?",
  "37645": "From what can it proceed?",

  "37654": "With respect to the employments of a soldier, a senator, and a judge, which are evidently necessary to the community, shall they be allotted to different persons, or shall the same person execute both?",
  "37655": "Who are we ourselves?",
  "37656": "Rather costly, I suppose, my dear, was it not?",
  "37657": "How could I answer her arguments?",
  "37658": "Billie?",
  "37659": "And indeed, what is there in the idea of measuring, and consequently of fixing, value, that is unscientific?",
  "37660": "And do you call a man your friend whom you have only known for eight or ten days?",
  "37661": "And what do you do, sire?",
  "37662": "I know that, fool, do I not?",

  "37731": "And yet you were acknowledging a little while ago that knowledge is not the same as opinion?",
  "37732": "Do you not see that society is dissolving, that a spirit of infatuation is carrying us away?",
  "37733": "Well, it's very pleasant to have you back again, and you understand all about art now, eh?",
  "37734": "And would you know what I would do unto him?",
  "37735": "You know he is your rival, do you?",
  "37736": "You do not know me?",
  "37737": "But what is there to investigate, sir?",
  "37738": "I may read this?",

  "37740": "Can this be death?",
  "37741": "You have heard of her, I dare say?",
  "37742": "Did he tell you so?",
  "37743": "And does the end of the world frighten you?",
  "37744": "Eustacia?",
  "37745": "What is it you'll tell?",
  "37746": "What is she thinking?",
  "37747": "Was it this voice, or at all like this voice?",
  "37748": "What was the question you put to the officer at the gate?",
  "37749": "Could we handle that dumb thing, or would it handle us?",
  "37750": "What, then, was the change which now took place?",

  "38543": "Could you keep a secret, if I told you one?",
  "38544": "Are you going to take this bird with you also?",
  "38545": "Some brandy?",
  "38546": "Did you fear that we should forget it?",
  "38547": "What heavenly particle inspires the clay?",
  "38548": "Is all else bare?",
  "38549": "The question is, how is that object to be attained?",
  "38550": "Or would the sight of it bring recollections calculated to enervate and distress?",
  "38551": "But what is he ferreting for?",
  "38552": "Who dares at my court be a protector of heretics?",
  "38553": "Will we ever get there?",
  "38554": "Is that far, sir?",
  "38555": "Is it thus you perform your charge, monsieur?",
  "38556": "Where I am going to be married?",
  "38557": "But there has been some official investigation?",
  "38558": "Do you not think that they have sent for you, both for the same thing?",
  "38559": "Teeth, you mean?",
  "38560": "Where are that old man and that child you speak of?",
  "38561": "What is his crime in its moral aspects, to merit such a judgment?",
  "38562": "Not to one?",
  "38563": "You have a boat of your own, nevertheless?",
  "38564": "And had you been captain, should you have retained him in his employment?",
  "38565": "But what is the meaning of this change?",
  "38566": "Can you really do such wonderful transformations?",
  "38567": "Some new relics?",
  "38568": "At his house?",
  "38569": "Are you very much in love with her?",
  "38570": "Am I not sick?",
  "38571": "Is something the matter?",
  "38572": "What can you do?",
  "38573": "And if the vote be really no infallible talisman for man, why should we expect it to work magical wonders in the hands of woman?",
  "38574": "Ay, is it not?",
  "38575": "Who will lend his cape?",
  "38576": "It should be larceny, I'm thinking?",
  "38577": "Would you go with them?",
  "38578": "Why not?",
  "38579": "How did you manage to get here?",
  "38580": "What are your special sins?",
  "38581": "What's this they tell me?",
  "38582": "Do you say that I am false to you?",
  "38583": "She could not surely still love that other man who had treated her with such vile falsehood?",
  "38584": "Will you bet three to one he is not found guilty?",
  "38585": "Were you stopped?",
  "38586": "Had the twenty years of war worn out the blade as it had worn the scabbard, the soul as well as the body?",
  "38587": "What say you?",
  "38588": "And leave the person to whom one gives the thing, you mean, to discover it?",
  "38589": "In what state was the house when you left?",
  "38590": "Would that make the navigation better or worse?",
  "38591": "Electricity?",
  "38592": "For, in short, if it were not he, who could it be?",
  "38593": "Do you know him, then?",
  "38594": "If all our institutions are based upon an error in calculation, does it not follow that these institutions are so many shams?",
  "38595": "And how are you, my dear boy?",
  "38596": "Oh, what can I say?",
  "38597": "But is the old min agreeable?",
  "38598": "Does the author promise a second part at all?",
  "38599": "What was it we were talking about?",
  "38600": "And who is to pay him?",
  "38601": "Can you stand?",
  "38602": "Shall I assume that we ourselves are able and experienced judges and have before now met with such a person?",
  "38603": "Will you hazard so desperate a step while there is any possibility that any portion of the ills you fly from have no real existence?",
  "38604": "MUST a name mean something?",
  "38605": "What will your mother say?",
  "38606": "Are you a ghost?",
  "38607": "He is greatly changed?",
  "38608": "Mary, do you remember the last time that we were together?",
  "38609": "Was it not you who spoke to me about a certain young man?",
  "38610": "So now, what's to be done?",
  "38611": "But with what shall I reward him?",
  "38612": "Take it out?",
  "38613": "And how many were there of these linen drapers?",
  "38614": "But will you allow me for one minute to take my supposition for granted?",
  "38615": "How, then?",
  "38616": "And have you not been to bed?",
  "38617": "But what did you do while it was raining?",
  "38618": "And, when the ghost speaks to you, what does he say?",
  "38619": "Pedringano?",
  "38620": "Kept her, on that sweet construction, to be his mistress?",
  "38621": "Did you steal into my confidence, and with scoffing mouth spy out the secrets of my heart, in order to go away and betray them to your paramour?",
  "38622": "Shall I knock?",
  "38623": "A barrowful of WHAT?",
  "38624": "Who is so wise as to have perfect knowledge of all things?",
  "38625": "But what's the matter?",
  "38626": "Perhaps for another reason?",
  "38627": "Are we quite alone, monsieur?",
  "38628": "How do you go to work?",
  "38629": "But what has she done?",
  "38630": "A chair?",
  "38631": "Not a first attempt, I take it?",
  "38632": "Go with you, is it?",
  "38633": "Ah, what IS it, now?",
  "38634": "If you're not then, where's your faith?",
  "38635": "Does that suggest anything to you?",
  "38636": "In what?",
  "38637": "Worked in the yards before?",
  "38638": "Shall I not read now?",
  "38639": "And if once there has been love, if they have been married for love, why should love pass away?",
  "38640": "Why are you so gay, fellow?",
  "38641": "But you do not yourself look upon this as likely?",
  "38642": "Whether she be living?",
  "38643": "What possible use is he now?",
  "38644": "Was he afraid of measuring swords with this trained detective?",
  "38645": "Well, and what harm is there in that?",
  "38646": "Not that, either?",
  "38647": "Trow?",
  "38648": "Who was the soundest of their logicians?",
  "38649": "Your mother, then, is quite well?",
  "38650": "Does it take so much time?",
  "38651": "What foolery is this?",
  "38652": "Went very well, did he?",
  "38653": "But why did you come, and do this wrong thing, after doing such a right thing as you have done?",
  "38654": "And what do you think about father?",
  "38655": "But what do you expect?",
  "38656": "But why does anybody care about him?",
  "38657": "What do you fear?",
  "38658": "In the first place, you will sup with me, will you not?",
  "38659": "Was he aware, in short, that the entire motions of the terrestrial sphere had undergone a complete modification?",
  "38660": "But could anyone possibly eat sixty monks?",
  "38661": "How can I decide?",
  "38662": "Is the king pleased?",
  "38663": "Can you, sir, produce any witnesses to the truth of what you have asserted?",
  "38664": "Did they really?",
  "38665": "What are you saying?",
  "38666": "Do you know the consequence of this recall to me, my old darling?",
  "38667": "Need I ask again whether the eye has an end?",
  "38668": "What was I?",
  "38669": "And why did you show so much joy in reading it?",
  "38670": "Will your worships give me leave to squeeze in a story between these two pages?",
  "38671": "What is the secret?",
  "38672": "Are you her daughter?",
  "38673": "What does your mistress call you when she wants you?",
  "38674": "My dear sir, will you allow me to ask you a question?",
  "38675": "What produced this extraordinary occurrence?",
  "38676": "And you ate in your carriage?",
  "38677": "Did not an immortal physicist and interpreter of hieroglyphs write detestable verses?",
  "38678": "Uncle, is it true that we are to go?",
  "38679": "Shall I ring?",
  "38680": "Yet what can I do?",
  "38681": "What the devil is that?",
  "38682": "Well, and how is your land doing?",
  "38683": "How?",
  "38684": "How's your father?",
  "38685": "If by any means we omit to do this, what follows?",
  "38686": "Blayne, what will you take?",
  "38687": "Would you please remain in the room?",
  "38688": "Are you quite sure, anyhow, that they have not read it?",
  "38689": "Do you object to that?",
  "38690": "Now, you men, what do you want?",
  "38691": "Who occupies the adjoining house?",
  "38692": "You understand me, do you not?",
  "38693": "Grimwig, will you leave us for a few minutes?",
  "38694": "Do I live, sir?",
  "38695": "It is for your sake, then, madame?",
  "38696": "Was the alarm being given?",
  "38697": "And are the hours of pleasure so frequent in life, that when a man gets a couple of quiet ones to spend in familiar chat with his wife, they must be poisoned by petty mortifications?",
  "38698": "Do you despise your lives?",
  "38699": "Tell him what?",
  "38700": "Here is a fellow, who, infected by the most pestilent and blasphemous code of devilry that ever was known, abandoned his property to the vilest scum of the earth that ever did murder by wholesale, and you ask me why I am sorry that a man who instructs youth knows him?",
  "38701": "Heh?",
  "38702": "Was she kinder, now?",
  "38703": "Then let me ask you to consider further whether the world will ever be induced to believe in the existence of absolute beauty rather than of the many beautiful, or of the absolute in each kind rather than of the many in each kind?",
  "38704": "How do you come here, child?",
  "38705": "Now, who's auctioneer?",
  "38706": "What's the difference?",
  "38707": "What are you paid for, children of hell?",
  "38708": "What happeneth?",
  "38709": "You mean we are strangers from this minute?",
  "38710": "And for whom?",
  "38711": "Why had her husband not written to her?",
  "38712": "Shall I call on him as I pass?",
  "38713": "Have you not much more?",
  "38714": "Then the world cannot possibly be a philosopher?",
  "38715": "Must we not ask who are to be rulers and who subjects?",
  "38716": "My dear girl, would it not be carrying the experiment unnecessarily far?",
  "38717": "How can one enjoy himself seeing that he is hunted to death, unless he courts and wishes it?",
  "38718": "How do you do, sir?",
  "38719": "How should I know it?",
  "38720": "In what way do I make kardopos masculine?",
  "38721": "Pip?",
  "38722": "Is she piquant?",
  "38723": "He must go into the town, but what should he do there?",
  "38724": "May I lay my head against your knee?",
  "38725": "And should I, poor sinner that I am, be ashamed to do likewise?",
  "38726": "Mysterious enough for you?",
  "38727": "Why should not people do these things?",
  "38728": "Again, would you not be cautious of affirming that the addition of one to one, or the division of one, is the cause of two?",
  "38729": "What would she do about that?",
  "38730": "Why did he say he knew that trick?",
  "38731": "I beg your pardon, sir?",
  "38732": "And what do you call 'her' lie?",
  "38733": "Who did advise no navy out to set?",
  "38734": "Must it?",
  "38735": "What makes you say you have?",
  "38736": "What is the highest of all species of being, and what is the lowest?",
  "38737": "But what good would that do you when you came to stand trial?",
  "38738": "Nor heard him?",
  "38739": "I have not hurt you?",
  "38740": "Do people never weep except from envy?",
  "38741": "What's inside?",
  "38742": "And what can HE have to say?",
  "38743": "Why should we injure our health by close study?",
  "38744": "At what height are we?",
  "38745": "Will you call me a name I want you to call me?",
  "38746": "Is there always such a visible body?",
  "38747": "Should it then be thus?",
  "38748": "Can you imagine a milking stool tilted and bowled violently along the ground?",
  "38749": "But if they abstained from injuring one another, then they might act together better?",
  "38750": "Was I right?",
  "38751": "What should such dainty natures do under such indignity but leap as from death?",
  "38752": "But will you be mine?",
  "38753": "Art sure he does not hear us?",
  "38754": "And since then you have carried on your business conscientiously?",
  "38755": "Can you get me some right away?",
  "38756": "Whereabouts is the bed?",
  "38757": "And can you mention any pursuit of mankind in which the male sex has not all these gifts and qualities in a higher degree than the female?",
  "38758": "I could sing it now, and not mind at all?",
  "38759": "It was drink maybe?",
  "38760": "Said I not so?",
  "38761": "You know, eh?",
  "38762": "Shall I be indiscreet if I ask you to tell me the facts of the case?",
  "38763": "What harm could such accusations, even if he made them publicly, do me here?",
  "38764": "And have you communicated your triumphant idea to anybody?",
  "38765": "Is his crime, then, very heinous?",
  "38766": "Why not?",
  "38767": "Will you come into the parlor?",
  "38768": "Fouquet?",
  "38769": "Had this well branches besides the communication with the sea?",
  "38770": "What have I to be afraid of?",
  "38771": "Why did I speak, and destroy such a pretty little picture?",
  "38772": "Is it nonsense?",
  "38773": "What do I know of life?",
  "38774": "Lastly, who shall forbid and separate all idle resort, all evil company?",
  "38775": "And if it is so, WHY is it?",
  "38776": "And you still make use of your sword?",
  "38777": "How will you treat us all next, I wonder?",
  "38778": "And you really will help us?",
  "38779": "Can you answer useful questions?",
  "38780": "But what if they had no such medicinal property?",
  "38781": "Had the unhappy man been dragged away by his former accomplices?",
  "38782": "If this valley is closed to me and I can never come back, how can I leave you behind, and me perhaps in hiding from the police with never a chance of a message?",
  "38783": "Do you know why two and two make four?",
  "38784": "Gone to bed?",
  "38785": "Who could have believed it possible?",
  "38786": "What did they tell you about him?",
  "38787": "Not bear down upon it at once?",
  "38788": "How are you living?",
  "38789": "With the hand?",
  "38790": "Who's the t'other one?",
  "38791": "Now then, where are you taking my cloak to?",
  "38792": "What then will protect ME?",
  "38793": "Did he indeed?",
  "38794": "What is praise, except indeed so far as it has a certain utility?",
  "38795": "Will there be any mass?",
  "38796": "Have you time now?",
  "38797": "What have you done, old fellow?",
  "38798": "What, and shall we see him clown it?",
  "38799": "It's not agreeable, is it?",
  "38800": "Have you a letter of audience?",
  "38801": "Can we conceive anything more destructive to morality than this?",
  "38802": "To what purpose?",
  "38803": "Why of no use?",
  "38804": "Is there only one?",
  "38805": "Hot bath?",
  "38806": "And, further, is not one part of us body, another part soul?",
  "38807": "Why not take a little shop yourself?",
  "38808": "Then are you a coward?",
  "38809": "Why did you make no attempt to throw the pursuers off the track, to have them intercepted?",
  "38810": "Were not these your words?",
  "38811": "What said he?",
  "38812": "Why else should you hold it from me?",
  "38813": "What makes you so venturesome and hardy?",
  "38814": "And what's that?",
  "38815": "Was it in order to pay us a simple visit?",
  "38816": "You're not an artist, then?",
  "38817": "When do you take supper?",
  "38818": "But if they refuse can I count on you?",
  "38819": "Who could be willing that these things should be no more?",
  "38820": "Who set the whisper going first?",
  "38821": "What do you mean, what are you saying?",
  "38822": "If even things which are foreseen sometimes hurt us, what can things which are not foreseen do, but grievously injure?",
  "38823": "Suppose we select an example of either kind, in order that we may have a general notion of them?",
  "38824": "What is a being?",
  "38825": "Then you keep moving round, I suppose?",
  "38826": "Have you not tried before to perfect yourself and become better, and nothing has come of it?",
  "38827": "Have we relations with the court?",
  "38828": "You'll take part in the service, I suppose?",
  "38829": "Why did they separate, guardian?",
  "38830": "Did my young men take his scalp?",
  "38831": "You know about her trouble?",
  "38832": "What will that be?",
  "38833": "What right has he not to wish to receive me into his family?",
  "38834": "Have I not then the mourner's privilege?",
  "38835": "Will you explain what the trouble is?",
  "38836": "Can you see a place to land?",
  "38837": "Stay in the country all the time, do you mean?",
  "38838": "It is all vanity to be sure, but who will not own to liking a little of it?",
  "38839": "Would her death affect any one's interest?",
  "38840": "How come your boots are so muddy?",
  "38841": "Why are they here?",
  "38842": "What did he mean?",
  "38843": "Was he silenced?",
  "38844": "Then shall we proceed to show that the corruption of the majority is also unavoidable, and that this is not to be laid to the charge of philosophy any more than the other?",
  "38845": "How could anything right come from him or from her?",
  "38846": "What did you do that for, any way?",
  "38847": "You are not going out?",
  "38848": "Well, my dear?",
  "38849": "What is the cause of all that dust?",
  "38850": "So we will not say anything about it, or let them take her away?",
  "38851": "Does that interest you?",
  "38852": "Does he believe that I think of a wretched fiddle when the spirit speaks to me?",
  "38853": "But to whom should I say that?",
  "38854": "What do they aim at proving?",
  "38855": "Who is ambitious?",
  "38856": "Come, what did she say?",
  "38857": "Doctor, what would you think now of my getting married?",
  "38858": "Is she absolutely unapproachable?",
  "38859": "Why will it vex itself, and twist its little face into bewitching nutcrackers?",
  "38860": "What, now, directly?",
  "38861": "But how far was their advice to be respected?",
  "38862": "Was there another such a wretched being as she in the world?",
  "38863": "Why be so distressed?",
  "38864": "Will you speak it to whom I wish?",
  "38865": "That's what you mean, is it?",
  "38866": "But how are we to get down below this liquid surface?",
  "38867": "Where do sail from?",
  "38868": "What can I do to make this child understand me?",
  "38869": "I did?",
  "38870": "What would you pay?",
  "38871": "And are there no cardinals that can fight?",
  "38872": "This being the case, gentlemen, how would it do for us to agree to a change like this?",
  "38873": "Is that all true?",
  "38874": "Can we not escape from this country?",
  "38875": "What shall we do now?",
  "38876": "But when I tell you I am married, is it not a consequence that we must have new clothes?",
  "38877": "You know it well, then?",
  "38878": "A lover on a day of farewell, a husband on a day of revenge, or the one whose head it had graced on the day of despair?",
  "38879": "So you will manage the empty coffin?",
  "38880": "But was the dawn wonderful?",
  "38881": "Nobody came into the room at all?",
  "38882": "Why is he cross with me?",
  "38883": "What's the use?",
  "38884": "Well, mate?",
  "38885": "Or have successive variations been accumulated and determined as a protection, or for some unknown purpose, or that one sex may be attractive to the other?",
  "38886": "This outward mourning, what does it signify?",
  "38887": "What was that, sir?",
  "38888": "What sudden eagerness is this you evince?",
  "38889": "What has she to reflect about, who must obey?",
  "38890": "Why this delay?",
  "38891": "Do his fits begin like that?",
  "38892": "Is there some new reason for this banishment?",
  "38893": "Will you give me that?",
  "38894": "Ah, you knew that?",
  "38895": "Where is the standard of perfection to be found?",
  "38896": "What order do you refer to?",
  "38897": "Of an evening?",
  "38898": "How could a ghost be alive?",
  "38899": "You speak of an evil time, and nevertheless you hope, your highness?",
  "38900": "Was he a gentleman?",
  "38901": "For who is there coming humbly to the fountain of sweetness, carrieth not away thence at the least some little of that sweetness?",
  "38902": "Shall I do it?",
  "38903": "Whar'll I be, when a stone goes six times as far as it does on heah?",
  "38904": "What force has a multitude?",
  "38905": "Is mine less hard to bear or is it harder to bear, when my whole living was in it and has been thus shamefully sucked away?",
  "38906": "Of what nature?",
  "38907": "What doth the lad mean?",
  "38908": "Is it strange that a man whose kindness is thus abused, should send sheriff's officers to reclaim what is due to him?",
  "38909": "And where did he get it, mamma?",
  "38910": "I will appeal to any of these gentlemen, could I leave my guest in the hands of a hideous bandit, as you term him?",
  "38911": "What people are you leading thus into the bowels of the earth?",
  "38912": "But not actually raining?",
  "38913": "Was there anything peculiar about any of those skeletons?",
  "38914": "How does opium induce sleep?",
  "38915": "Quite so, but how was it to be done, how to prevent it?",
  "38916": "What can he mean by all this about money?",
  "38917": "But what happened thereupon?",
  "38918": "Who are you at all?",
  "38919": "And do you know what reward we shall offer them?",
  "38920": "About breakfast?",
  "38921": "What right had the friendless to complain?",
  "38922": "If I ran your unfortunate friend through the body, what did I do with the body?",
  "38923": "Did your client commit the robbery?",
  "38924": "You suppose that it will be good?",
  "38925": "Is it a dream of pain, or of pleasure?",
  "38926": "Why did you not stop him till I came?",
  "38927": "But once more, what is there to fear?",
  "38928": "Will you have a cigarette?",
  "38929": "And what are you crying for?",
  "38930": "Have you any reason to suspect robbery?",
  "38931": "Do you take me for a brute?",
  "38932": "What did you do it for?",

  "39326": "What, then, has been the foundation of all this controversy?",
  "39327": "Oswald, what is the matter?",
  "39328": "Who still wanteth to rule?",
  "39329": "Call for me at eight o'clock or shall I wait supper for you at seven?",
  "39330": "Down the staircase and along the corridors or to his room at the end?",
  "39331": "If you are not handsome, what then?",
  "39332": "What is it you depend on?",
  "39333": "And how am I to do so?",
  "39334": "And what do you make of it?",
  "39335": "But could a child of that age have a soul like that?",
  "39336": "Let him slip through our hands?",
  "39337": "Maggie only worst then?",
  "39338": "What's wrong with it?",
  "39339": "Some other man, then?",
  "39340": "You have just come down?",
  "39341": "Would you march at the head of your musketeers, with your sword in your hand, to observe any spot whatever, or an enemy's position?",
  "39342": "Is it likely that the trouble of one wife and mother would be much to us now?",
  "39343": "Come?",
  "39344": "Of the magicians and genii?",
  "39345": "Who's making personal remarks now?",
  "39346": "You admit that?",
  "39347": "Is your honour looking for a boat?",
  "39348": "Shall we form a business partnership?",
  "39349": "Will you join us?",
  "39350": "What are the advantages promised to counterbalance these disadvantages?",
  "39351": "Why did that fool allow himself to die of hunger with sixty years of unlived life before him?",
  "39352": "Whom did she murder?",
  "39353": "Did you give the letter?",
  "39354": "I suppose you have not heard that one young man levanted last year to save himself from a breach of promise case?",
  "39355": "Well, are we going for the children?",
  "39356": "Is that all?",
  "39357": "But who was present?",
  "39358": "Under a pretext of luxury would you like to establish new classes of citizens?",
  "39359": "What else have I that I can think of?",
  "39360": "In what business?",
  "39361": "Now are you happy again?",
  "39362": "Ah yes, and what else did he say that's unpleasant?",
  "39363": "That's what I'm to do, is it?",
  "39364": "Vronsky?",
  "39365": "Where did you get this ring?",
  "39366": "Age?",
  "39367": "Have you never loved ANYBODY in all your life, uncle?",
  "39368": "Will you pay me, sir?",
  "39369": "Is she gone?",
  "39370": "Tom?",
  "39371": "Who was the better for it?",
  "39372": "How long is it since I rented your house?",
  "39373": "Oh, that's the trouble is it?",
  "39374": "Has she heard?",
  "39375": "Why do you wish to know?",
  "39376": "Could he not squeeze under the seat of a carriage?",
  "39377": "Or what does he know about anything for that matter?",
  "39378": "Do you mean to refuse me altogether?",
  "39379": "Why do you ask?",
  "39380": "Is not death in my house?",
  "39381": "There is not room for one more?",
  "39382": "Has your debt been paid you?",
  "39383": "Then what brought you among our enemies?",
  "39384": "Have I at least convinced you, sire?",
  "39385": "A crook?",
  "39386": "What am I to say to her?",
  "39387": "All this time?",
  "39388": "Do you admit that education is a benefit for the people?",
  "39389": "So will you, PLEASE will you, keep from questioning me?",
  "39390": "And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose?",
  "39391": "The murderer?",
  "39392": "And to attend the court no more?",
  "39393": "And have you been here long?",
  "39394": "What have I done, and what could I do?",
  "39395": "Who is mourning for the daughter?",
  "39396": "Will it hurt?",
  "39397": "Has there been any paramour who disgraced himself that lie might help his neighbours?",
  "39398": "But, comrades, what shall we do now?",
  "39399": "About what, mother?",
  "39400": "If this assertion be true, is it not a useless task to educate man with the purpose of making him better and nobler?",
  "39401": "Where was it?",
  "39402": "In such cases, who is to decide, the living or the dead?",
  "39403": "How did that come about?",
  "39404": "Not going at all?",
  "39405": "Did you say those words to her?",
  "39406": "Whuzzamatter whiz you?",
  "39407": "Gentle count, brave soldier, where are you?",
  "39408": "But why this question?",
  "39409": "Was it not too horrible?",
  "39410": "You really think so?",
  "39411": "Had you doubted it, then?",
  "39412": "Do you hear how he's walking?",
  "39413": "But why do I argue thus?",
  "39414": "A letter?",
  "39415": "You mean of family ties?",
  "39416": "Did she eat or drink here?",
  "39417": "What in the devil is the matter with you, my friend?",
  "39418": "How then?",
  "39419": "Do you know it or not?",
  "39420": "You see, I destroy it?",
  "39421": "Will you not wait and breakfast?",
  "39422": "To refresh me?",
  "39423": "Are you supporting them also?",
  "39424": "This varnish?",
  "39425": "And on what floor does he live?",
  "39426": "Why so positive?",
  "39427": "Has he ever whaled it any?",
  "39428": "And, more especially, can he pass unfriendly legislation to violate his oath?",
  "39429": "Who's here?",
  "39430": "Now, when he is in this state of mind, if some one gently comes to him and tells him that he is a fool and must get understanding, which can only be got by slaving for it, do you think that, under such adverse circumstances, he will be easily induced to listen?",
  "39431": "What shall be said of these?",
  "39432": "You cannot tell me?",
  "39433": "Where'd you get the blue ticket?",
  "39434": "Surely will my last night's dream be realised?",
  "39435": "Where was he going?",
  "39436": "Stoepel?",
  "39437": "But why should I be there rather than in this beautiful room?",
  "39438": "How well are the machine sheds at the barracks guarded?",
  "39439": "Had you had a row?",
  "39440": "What has it all been about?",
  "39441": "Why did you not darken your light, that he might be stricken with horror at his crime?",
  "39442": "After this?",
  "39443": "Before the boy comes?",
  "39444": "But why need I wear spectacles?",
  "39445": "Where then do you mean to take refuge?",
  "39446": "What are you going to do with him, assuming that you've got him?",
  "39447": "After a pause of several minutes, their silence was broken, by his asking her in a voice of some agitation, when he was to congratulate her on the acquisition of a brother?",
  "39448": "And what did you say to her?",
  "39449": "Why mine?",
  "39450": "Did no one examine?",
  "39451": "Would that be right?",
  "39452": "And how did you verify them?",
  "39453": "Will you be frank, very frank with me?",
  "39454": "Whither should I go?",
  "39455": "Now tell I tell you something?",
  "39456": "Whose voice was that?",
  "39457": "What will happen, then?",
  "39458": "Did he give his name?",
  "39459": "And where is the consulate?",
  "39460": "Why does he let things be so?",
  "39461": "Singly?",
  "39462": "Mary what, then?",
  "39463": "Are you going?",
  "39464": "I suppose you were a gentleman, then, as well as now?",
  "39465": "Will you be pleased to hang me?",
  "39466": "Camp in a bog, would you?",
  "39467": "Ah what's this I smell?",
  "39468": "And why am I disturbed, for the dispersion of my elements will happen whatever I do?",
  "39469": "Do you doubt it?",
  "39470": "But why not, my dear?",
  "39471": "But how did he account for it?",
  "39472": "Danae means a shower of gold, does it not?",
  "39473": "And in that case they will be right in doing good to the evil and evil to the good?",
  "39474": "Would I reflect on the price?",
  "39475": "Does anyone know where it is?",
  "39476": "Perhaps, gentlemen, if he had not said this in your presence and I had reported it, you'd have held this to be impossible likewise, eh?",
  "39477": "As to arming them, how is that to be done?",
  "39478": "How long ago?",
  "39479": "What pickpockets are they who ply their trade in the rear of glory?",
  "39480": "Will not the three men be found?",
  "39481": "What are they doin' THERE, for gracious sakes?",
  "39482": "How is it that that name rises upon all occasions to torment my ears, during the last two or three days?",
  "39483": "Or maybe it is that monsieur does not care to hunt marauders?",
  "39484": "To keep her in?",
  "39485": "And what do you?",
  "39486": "First, you are sorry for what you've done, and you see the folly of it all?",
  "39487": "Are they or their descendants to embrace our faith?",
  "39488": "Where is the church?",
  "39489": "Nor by reason of a knowledge which advises about brazen pots, I said, nor as possessing any other similar knowledge?",
  "39490": "Who shall judge of the continuance of the danger?",
  "39491": "Are you sure we are alone?",
  "39492": "Are you quite sure that this is a man, or that he has ever been one?",
  "39493": "Who said it?",
  "39494": "The queen wears the rosette?",
  "39495": "To give him an opportunity or making some of his severe remarks and moral reflections, and to undo what we had so much trouble in effecting?",
  "39496": "Pannus, pro quo supponit?",
  "39497": "Swann?",
  "39498": "But is there any doubt as to what he will do on the prominent questions if elected?",
  "39499": "Do you count that as nothing?",
  "39500": "Was it religion that prompted him to cannibalism?",
  "39501": "But do you say he will marry you?",
  "39502": "Their feet?",
  "39503": "Wha will bind up the brags of weir?",
  "39504": "Is he still here?",
  "39505": "The thing was proven upon him?",
  "39506": "Do you feel rather easier?",
  "39507": "Where are the matches?",
  "39508": "Then, for all your valour, you would save your life?",
  "39509": "Guilty of what?",
  "39510": "Why, is any day old and new?",
  "39511": "Nor would you say that medicine is the art of receiving pay because a man takes fees when he is engaged in healing?",
  "39512": "You have, at least, money to receive, as you have an order?",
  "39513": "How she does?",
  "39514": "What does he feel?",
  "39515": "Why are they turned out?",
  "39516": "Very decided character there, sir?",
  "39517": "Remain here?",
  "39518": "Where is he?",
  "39519": "How long have you been here?",
  "39520": "Can he hear my word?",
  "39521": "Where is it then?",
  "39522": "Which would you like best for me to make you, a little cake and bless you, or a big cake and curse you?",
  "39523": "His flatterers?",
  "39524": "Reward?",
  "39525": "How shall I bear it?",
  "39526": "Shall we go up and join my mother?",
  "39527": "What made you suppose we should be?",
  "39528": "In gold, silver, or notes?",
  "39529": "But the sympathies of the latter were with the mother?",
  "39530": "What money have we?",
  "39531": "The election came, and what was the result?",
  "39532": "There is no exit?",
  "39533": "You know what a file is?",
  "39534": "A very strange one?",
  "39535": "Did you know that I have a son?",
  "39536": "You are the cure, are you not?",
  "39537": "You see this foot?",
  "39538": "A rabbit?",
  "39539": "Direct?",
  "39540": "Where have you been so long?",
  "39541": "But is it possible that we are not all associated?",
  "39542": "Who can it be?",
  "39543": "Can you say the person who fought many a sanguinary battle, who got through many cunning negotiations with enemies and friends, who personally experienced the troubles of polygamy, was a person sinless and divine?",
  "39544": "Quite well?",
  "39545": "Which makes in my coffers?",
  "39546": "My dear boy, I hope you are not worn out?",
  "39547": "You do not think we would harm you?",
  "39548": "Hempseed?",
  "39549": "But you will go to heaven, mamma, and why should I not speak of it?",
  "39550": "How could a little chap like me hurt so many people?",
  "39551": "And who served under an assumed name?",
  "39552": "Have you another as good?",
  "39553": "Are you sleepy, darling?",
  "39554": "How was he dressed?",
  "39555": "Why ask this grace?",
  "39556": "But, my dear child, do you mean to say you could not love me if I had some other name?",
  "39557": "I will do well?",
  "39558": "Are you not going to wait until we bring the hostages?",
  "39559": "Sit down in your presence?",
  "39560": "I trouble YOU?",
  "39561": "You dismiss me, monsieur?",
  "39562": "Your father's not at home, I think, is he?",
  "39563": "And do you want to know where I found it?",
  "39564": "Do you mean the sorrel horse?",
  "39565": "Do you like me at all?",
  "39566": "Why these cries?",
  "39567": "Are you in a hurry, sir?",
  "39568": "What, now, pray?",
  "39569": "How is it possible for me to lose it at the moment your majesty's service calls for it?",
  "39570": "She was taken ill, you mean, and went home?",
  "39571": "Must one clatter like kettledrums and penitential preachers?",
  "39572": "I understand that the yew hedge is penetrated at one point by a gate?",
  "39573": "For what are words but words?",
  "39574": "How many of the wise and learned have married their cooks?",
  "39575": "Will she be able to go home today?",
  "39576": "But, my friend, is not that just the reason why you should trust in this matter to someone who can be more calm than yourself?",
  "39577": "Himself?",
  "39578": "If the fortifications of it are new or old?",
  "39579": "Do you eat gum leaves?",
  "39580": "Is not this your hope?",
  "39581": "You are not certain, of course?",
  "39582": "What did that poor, sweet girl do that you should want to cast such dishonour on her grave?",
  "39583": "Mine only joy, what can I more?",
  "39584": "Notice a telephone in the outer office?",
  "39585": "And what am I?",
  "39586": "How does that concern you?",
  "39587": "And why were they so terribly afraid of the dark?",
  "39588": "If you are a friend, why do you bite me so hard?",
  "39589": "But what security is there for the same qualities on the part of monarchy?",
  "39590": "And who has been drinking out of my little glass?",
  "39591": "Pip?",
  "39592": "None whatever?",
  "39593": "What is that to the purpose?",
  "39594": "What do you want to satisfy yourself about?",
  "39595": "And do you ask me that?",
  "39596": "Who all our seamen cheated of their debt?",
  "39597": "What's my return?",
  "39598": "How could it be, then, that I did not like her much the better of the two?",
  "39599": "But, gentlemen, whoever can pride himself on his diseases and even swagger over them?",
  "39600": "What force, what invincible instinct, what custom of centuries impels these birds to come back to this place?",
  "39601": "But may I be permitted solemnly to invoke my countrymen to pause and deliberate before they determine to destroy this the grandest temple which has ever been dedicated to human freedom since the world began?",
  "39602": "Well, what's going to happen now?",
  "39603": "What do YOU know about our faces?",
  "39604": "Then, you could dare censure for my sake?",
  "39605": "Had he perhaps chased butterflies too much?",
  "39606": "What, is't a prognostication raps him so?",
  "39607": "The arrangement of papers and documents?",
  "39608": "Well, doctor, suppose we were to go in pursuit of this cloud, since it refuses to burst upon us?",
  "39609": "How CAN I have done that?",
  "39610": "Were you hidden, or not?",
  "39611": "And does not the difference strike you?",
  "39612": "Dangerous?",
  "39613": "How are we this morning?",
  "39614": "And the nurse, of course?",
  "39615": "Is it blank cartridge or ball?",
  "39616": "You got it, then?",
  "39617": "Was there any hope of salvation for her either in this world or the next after such unnatural conduct?",
  "39618": "Pray, would you know the reason why I'm crying?",
  "39619": "Oh, how much for the jacket?",
  "39620": "What's amiss, dame?",
  "39621": "And who has not felt the same?",
  "39622": "What did your people say?",
  "39623": "Who knows not the double motion of the planets?",
  "39624": "Is my understanding sufficient for this or not?",
  "39625": "Was it still at all possible to be alive?",
  "39626": "Why should he be angry?",
  "39627": "Do you think she will find me much changed?",
  "39628": "What's that you've got, a dagger?",
  "39629": "Pray, with all your cleverness, why did not you manage to keep your eyes open?",
  "39630": "Have you got anything?",
  "39631": "You admit that you would fight, then?",
  "39632": "What says he?",
  "39633": "And what, after all, is the matter on hand?",
  "39634": "Or gold, ivory, purple, a lyre, a little knife, a flower, a shrub?",
  "39635": "What you know 'bout witches?",
  "39636": "Has he not come?",
  "39637": "How in the world can I know?",
  "39638": "What engagements?",
  "39639": "And how much do you want?",
  "39640": "What causes historical events?",
  "39641": "Degree of intelligence?",
  "39642": "Do they parade the cemetery as they parade the street?",
  "39643": "The mob's applauses, or the gifts of kings?",
  "39644": "You knew him, did you not?",
  "39645": "Why, how many tall ships, think ye, now, have I seen laid aboard?",
  "39646": "How long have you been here?",
  "39647": "Has it hurt you?",
  "39648": "What harm do they do?",
  "39649": "Friend or enemy?",
  "39650": "And will you really be an advocate for this unthankful, cruel man, who does not love you?",
  "39651": "Where is the count?",
  "39652": "If his mother were there in living burial, what could he do for her?",
  "39653": "But what are they to live upon?",
  "39654": "Grant that he desires the elective franchise, will he not attain it sooner by saving the already advanced steps towards it, than by running backward over them?",
  "39655": "And is he going to take you with him?",
  "39656": "What had he done?",
  "39657": "Well, and how is she?",
  "39658": "Should we let them go on or not?",
  "39659": "Over for the day?",
  "39660": "Is it a faith only for men, then?",
  "39661": "And why are you angry with your brother?",
  "39662": "Why is it art?",
  "39663": "Done?",
  "39664": "By whose permission?",
  "39665": "An cool?",
  "39666": "Can we venture not only to encounter the risk of their individual and mutual mismanagement, but at the same time to place our foreign and domestic policy entirely under the control of a foreign moneyed interest?",
  "39667": "What say ye, children?",
  "39668": "Say, can you make those dollars yet?",
  "39669": "What does that matter?",
  "39670": "Why do you debase yourself before them?",
  "39671": "What must then be done?",
  "39672": "Was I never to know ardent, feverish love in the moonlit shadows of a summer's night?",
  "39673": "Ever arise in society, and what principle there is in human nature so powerful as to overcome so strong a passion, or so violent as to obscure so clear a knowledge?",
  "39674": "Should he say he had been robbed?",
  "39675": "If he sent her the verses?",
  "39676": "How must I take hold of you in order not to hurt you?",
  "39677": "You've heard me grunt lately?",
  "39678": "Are you coming, m'dear?",
  "39679": "Soothly, who can say?",
  "39680": "Is not pleasing this?",
  "39681": "And suppose I brought you some money?",
  "39682": "Do any among them speak our language?",
  "39683": "And you want to talk to me about it instead of listening to me?",
  "39684": "Now, is it not unjust, and unlike you, to judge him from what you saw of me the other night?",
  "39685": "And on what account, my dear lieutenant?",
  "39686": "When have you found me false to your teaching?",
  "39687": "As what?",
  "39688": "Children alive?",
  "39689": "And what became of the parcel then?",
  "39690": "How much wages do you want a month?",
  "39691": "How dare you say this of me?",
  "39692": "Well, have you solved it?",
  "39693": "Is he dead indeed?",
  "39694": "Can it be that it's only possible to be just negatively?",
  "39695": "And who is to be the dean?",
  "39696": "Did you meet with any accident?",
  "39697": "Hansel, why do you stop and look round?",
  "39698": "Tell me what I must say to him?",
  "39699": "But who knows?",
  "39700": "Is it not sufficient for your infernal selfishness, that while you are at peace I shall writhe in the torments of hell?",
  "39701": "Amigoarawaysoo?",
  "39702": "This being so, is it really wise to let him be poor?",
  "39703": "Would it be a sin to rid the world of such a wretch?",
  "39704": "Have we lost our provisions?",
  "39705": "Was the cup left here?",
  "39706": "Run?",
  "39707": "Still, why should you not again be free, since you have already been so?",
  "39708": "Had you any conversation with the prisoner?",
  "39709": "Through what medium?",
  "39710": "Do you remember that?",
  "39711": "And evidently they must have had enough food, but where on earth had they got it from?",
  "39712": "Why who are you to come thus brawling upon my premises?",
  "39713": "Do you suppose your being young and natural, and fond of me and grateful to me, makes it any pleasure to me to have you near me?",
  "39714": "The cow?",
  "39715": "What sort of a man was he?",
  "39716": "How doth this harmonise?",
  "39717": "Will you send her any message?",
  "39718": "Why, what else can she do?",
  "39719": "What would they say to a bishop who was afraid?",
  "39720": "How is anyone to tell a story which he cannot understand himself?",

  "40510": "But why should I consort, I, a brave man, with the abominable?",
  "40511": "Can you guess, now, what this is?",
  "40512": "Suppose you were a foundling and were shown our faith and yours, and asked for which you would decide, which would you choose?",
  "40513": "And how on earth would she ever manage to hold her tongue during school hours?",
  "40514": "Are we afraid of foreign gold?",
  "40515": "Was it a double tooth, hey?",
  "40516": "And how can it all be done by daybreak?",
  "40517": "After these, what resentment can remain in the heart?",
  "40518": "But if she has so absolutely failed, what then had she done?",
  "40519": "And you remember, too, the period when he began to grow fatter?",
  "40520": "What is nature?",
  "40521": "What was it that was borne in upon my mind when she stood still and looked attentively at me?",
  "40522": "And you're not frightened?",
  "40523": "Are you a politician, friend?",
  "40524": "Have you not got all the plants and stones you want?",
  "40525": "What time was it?",
  "40526": "Is it obeying your husband to disobey him on the wital subject of his business?",
  "40527": "On what grounds?",
  "40528": "What is your address in the country?",
  "40529": "How will he ever know the truth, since I shall not tell him of it?",
  "40530": "It was he who rescued you?",
  "40531": "What, for instance, do you mean by all that humbug about the soul?",
  "40532": "Cannot I answer your purpose?",
  "40533": "To whom did he give up his sword?",
  "40534": "Would not that be a sacrifice of higher prospects for you?",
  "40535": "Say, what can cause such impotence of mind?",
  "40536": "But the doctor?",
  "40537": "What business have I with this pipe?",
  "40538": "You have a recipe for it?",
  "40539": "But she?",
  "40540": "Do you know anything about fortifications?",
  "40541": "Is there no merit in repentance?",
  "40542": "What became of you, dear?",
  "40543": "Well, what is to be done, mademoiselle, when so many wills are leagued against me?",
  "40544": "And besides, what is truth to us but the continuous progress of our mind from poetry to prose?",
  "40545": "Is there any point to which you would wish to draw my attention?",
  "40546": "Shall we go in?",
  "40547": "And how would I do it, think you?",
  "40548": "At least we can have a window?",
  "40549": "It was somewhere here?",
  "40550": "Must one die like a dog?",
  "40551": "What does that wagon contain?",
  "40552": "What's the matter with your leg?",
  "40553": "Might not some curious eye fasten on it, and divine its contents?",
  "40554": "What is the difference?",
  "40555": "Who's the other fool?",
  "40556": "Well, do you understand, monsieur?",
  "40557": "You are doing catkins?",
  "40558": "Now, how does a man search a revolving bookcase?",
  "40559": "On what ground do you venture to interfere with me, messieurs?",
  "40560": "What ails ye, man?",
  "40561": "What would be your surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness?",
  "40562": "If you're not coming yourself, give us the cards, will you?",
  "40563": "In the office?",
  "40564": "Ah, precious one, why does your lover live to see you dead?",
  "40565": "Could she be deceived as to the meaning of this?",
  "40566": "Do you really mean to say that that leg of yours is better already?",
  "40567": "Do you not think perhaps that some of the shortcoming lies with yourself?",
  "40568": "Her name?",
  "40569": "How can that be, monsieur?",
  "40570": "What duties?",
  "40571": "And suppose he can obtain his desires, is that so bad as cutting her throat?",
  "40572": "Look here, do you intend to take up you abode with us?",
  "40573": "What do you want to drink now?",
  "40574": "Carey?",
  "40575": "Happy?",
  "40576": "How old are you?",
  "40577": "Is it such as they that we are to follow?",
  "40578": "Do you not think that I also long for forgetfulness?",
  "40579": "What's this?",
  "40580": "What is the captain about?",
  "40581": "Cannot you tell him I will?",
  "40582": "Why had he not let them know that he was still working on the case?",
  "40583": "A ghost?",
  "40584": "Will you work?",
  "40585": "Where have you been, this long, long while?",
  "40586": "What might not have happened to men?",
  "40587": "With what color of propriety could the force necessary for defense be limited by those who cannot limit the force of offense?",
  "40588": "Is it bright?",
  "40589": "How could I know he hated him?",
  "40590": "And all this, for what, I pray?",
  "40591": "Who told you that I loved him?",
  "40592": "Is that what you meant?",
  "40593": "And did I do it for my country's sake?",
  "40594": "Why did you get married?",
  "40595": "But what exactly am I to tell you about them?",
  "40596": "Now where will it be agreeable to you that we hold our conference?",
  "40597": "Why does fate play such tricks with poor, helpless worms?",
  "40598": "Have you ever seen a snake rise up on your path?",
  "40599": "Do passive indolent women make the best wives?",
  "40600": "What would you feel, if a man were faithless to you?",
  "40601": "Has a dog money?",
  "40602": "What do you want there?",
  "40603": "Eliza, girl, what ails you today?",
  "40604": "What is there for me to eat this evening?",
  "40605": "Is there fate amongst us still, send down from the pagan world of old, that such things must be, and in such way?",
  "40606": "Then you had some grounds for supposing he might be the culprit?",
  "40607": "How on earth did you manage to become the favorite of the king, you who have never spoken to him more than twice in your life?",
  "40608": "And your second wish?",
  "40609": "If the view from below had been most interesting and singular, how shall I describe its appearance as seen from above?",
  "40610": "What do you think of a brilliant display of fireworks?",
  "40611": "Are you cold?",
  "40612": "Not so dusty, what?",
  "40613": "Till death itself?",
  "40614": "To defend him would be to accuse herself, would it not?",
  "40615": "But do you think it will rise?",
  "40616": "As bad as all that?",
  "40617": "May it not be spoken except in private?",
  "40618": "For the story?",
  "40619": "But not as a CELEBRITY?",
  "40620": "Is it possible that you do not know that comparisons of wit with wit, valour with valour, beauty with beauty, birth with birth, are always odious and unwelcome?",
  "40621": "When did you first begin this mad career?",
  "40622": "May he share your hopes?",
  "40623": "Would she so?",
  "40624": "Do you place it out at interest?",
  "40625": "I suppose that's why you never got married, uncle?",
  "40626": "But do you know why he did not come, papa?",
  "40627": "Then he is on board?",
  "40628": "Do you find the study of the lower orders interesting?",
  "40629": "Can you make any objection?",
  "40630": "It is quite decided, then?",
  "40631": "What shall I pay you for the body?",
  "40632": "Would he not rather say or do the same as his like in the same case?",
  "40633": "Stryver?",
  "40634": "But how do you and your neighbour get on about the disputed right of way?",
  "40635": "It is possible we may meet again,' and 'will it be of any consequence to you whether we do or not?",
  "40636": "Would he have to abdicate his precentorship, as he had his wardenship, and to give up chanting, as he had given up his twelve old bedesmen?",
  "40637": "What is he waiting for?",
  "40638": "Do you remember that's what you used to call them?",
  "40639": "And where is coldness so ugly as between brothers?",
  "40640": "You know you let me call you so?",
  "40641": "Where is he, then?",
  "40642": "Does the cardinal refuse to receive the king?",
  "40643": "Theurgy, magic, and sorcery?",
  "40644": "What can have happened to them all this time?",
  "40645": "What did you talk about?",
  "40646": "Why on earth do you say that?",
  "40647": "Do you know why it's called a whiting?",
  "40648": "Eyebrows?",
  "40649": "Could I forget them?",
  "40650": "Number and date taken, I suppose?",
  "40651": "Have I not borne secrets heavier than this?",
  "40652": "But, then, accidents?",
  "40653": "Do you think it would be any harm?",
  "40654": "Why not add to the first class the pachydermatous indifference to rebuffs which is of such service to the social climber, and, to the second, taste in dress and the habit of not repeating stories?",
  "40655": "Conrad, what is it?",
  "40656": "Is there nobody here who can sing a song to lighten the time?",
  "40657": "Bless me, how shall I behave?",
  "40658": "What harm can I do to you or to her?",
  "40659": "On me, uncle?",
  "40660": "Somebody has stolen a rabbit?",
  "40661": "Why enter into painful details, so easily divined by the intelligent reader?",
  "40662": "How do you come here?",
  "40663": "Does any answer come out of it?",
  "40664": "How can he find out his strength or weakness otherwise?",
  "40665": "Who's talking o' women?",
  "40666": "Have you never made others labor?",
  "40667": "Ist I will be reueng'd?",
  "40668": "Does he give you sharp answers?",
  "40669": "Do we want to contemplate his mercy?",
  "40670": "What is your theory, then, as to those footmarks?",
  "40671": "And how did you find out?",
  "40672": "Are your things sent off?",
  "40673": "Why did they fancy you?",
  "40674": "Will that suit you?",
  "40675": "Feel what, squire?",
  "40676": "So, then, am I her enemy?",
  "40677": "Saturday?",
  "40678": "How do you keep it on?",
  "40679": "Well, what if there is a trial?",
  "40680": "What are you yourself seeking?",
  "40681": "Would I be quiet and talk rationally?",
  "40682": "Well, what can you do?",
  "40683": "But what would grammar matter if he really loved her?",
  "40684": "Has he marked himself?",
  "40685": "I ask by whose authority?",
  "40686": "Why need he bother about my tuft?",
  "40687": "Farfrae's?",
  "40688": "Are you turning up your noses?",
  "40689": "What then remained?",
  "40690": "You're getting too proud to own me afore company, are you?",
  "40691": "Your father was fortunate, then?",
  "40692": "Do you really believe that such is our aim?",
  "40693": "Could he, as he asked, stop the sea with his hands?",
  "40694": "What has she done?",
  "40695": "I've fretted my gizzard green about it, maister, but what can I do?",
  "40696": "Quite for ever?",
  "40697": "Why do you keep tramping up and down like an old hen?",
  "40698": "Is it ketching?",
  "40699": "Your opinion, if you please, on this difficult matter?",
  "40700": "As her husband was a man of means, and had doubtless returned by this time, could she not send them the money?",
  "40701": "And dark?",
  "40702": "What name would your friend like to put on it?",
  "40703": "What are you going to tell me?",
  "40704": "And if you wished to die, you would choose this death, count?",
  "40705": "What are you doing out of your studio at this hour?",
  "40706": "Is love the only thing?",
  "40707": "For that only?",
  "40708": "And I hope you're good children, are you?",
  "40709": "How was it that no one else saw it?",
  "40710": "In our own house?",
  "40711": "Cannot you inform him that it is frightful earnest?",
  "40712": "Well, what shall we do?",
  "40713": "Well, then, are you the brave captain, are you the valiant blade who dispersed those who wished to burn the condemned?",
  "40714": "Will you please look into the case and restore the old man to his home if the public interest will admit?",
  "40715": "Why should we not imagine this the apartment of an honest mother?",
  "40716": "No bid?",
  "40717": "He comes to live with us?",
  "40718": "Have they come from the town?",
  "40719": "But who told you I was inactive?",
  "40720": "Can you remember any breakfast that I've had today?",
  "40721": "And what are they, captain?",
  "40722": "Well, what of it?",
  "40723": "What am I to do?",
  "40724": "Why did you leave there?",
  "40725": "What can you suppose?",
  "40726": "What drawer or tiring do you mean?",
  "40727": "Did he say whether he had any business to speak about?",
  "40728": "Are you 'fraid of bubbles, too?",
  "40729": "I hope you have preserved the unities, sir?",
  "40730": "Martha knew about you all the time?",
  "40731": "Why did you paint him?",
  "40732": "Come, who is this man who is in the basket?",
  "40733": "Because I like his company?",
  "40734": "How many desperate wretches have I sent to the devil?",
  "40735": "You've got them at last?",
  "40736": "Then why so hurry me?",
  "40737": "Why do you grovel before it?",
  "40738": "Is it all a quite dead garden?",
  "40739": "Now, do you know what all this means?",
  "40740": "Can nothing save him?",
  "40741": "You know his guilt?",
  "40742": "What was that miracle?",
  "40743": "And what may you have to say to him?",
  "40744": "Oh, madam, let me bring you a little something?",
  "40745": "Well, now, what are your conditions, if I employ you?",
  "40746": "You have as good as informed me, sir, that you are going shortly to be married?",
  "40747": "Oh, where is there deliverance from the flux of things and from the 'existence' of penalty?",
  "40748": "Do you think he wants to die?",
  "40749": "The only question was, had she ten or twelve?",
  "40750": "What faces are the most distinct to me in the fleeting crowd?",
  "40751": "What should you prefer?",
  "40752": "Why not, if it amuses him?",
  "40753": "And pray, where do you consider modern music to begin?",
  "40754": "Why do we hate?",
  "40755": "And if she cast it aside, her loyalty, her promise?",
  "40756": "A prisoner?",
  "40757": "But, even relying on his good faith, would be he able to keep his promise?",
  "40758": "Haow soon?",
  "40759": "But what can I do?",
  "40760": "You cannot say what it was?",
  "40761": "And the walks in the avenues?",
  "40762": "Who shall reveal the burning anxiety with which he throbbed to see beyond that cruel wall?",
  "40763": "What will he do?",
  "40764": "To whom shall I give the list of the children's linen?",
  "40765": "What have you said, but that I am to stay a fortnight longer?",
  "40766": "What do you think of a bite of a mouth like that?",
  "40767": "Shall I rise, madam, and pay my duty to my new aunt?",
  "40768": "Emp'ror?",
  "40769": "What other course could it pursue?",
  "40770": "Where's my ulster?",
  "40771": "What to do next?",
  "40772": "Dreadful apparition, why do you trouble me?",
  "40773": "Is she also taken away from me for ever?",
  "40774": "Would not the general loss be too great to justify such relief?",
  "40775": "How many did you get?",
  "40776": "But you like me in spite of it?",
  "40777": "Have you come from a great distance?",
  "40778": "What right have we to argue?",
  "40779": "Have you ever been there?",
  "40780": "With the king's command?",
  "40781": "And is she possessed with a devil?",
  "40782": "Upon what is opinion settled?",
  "40783": "Was it an accident?",
  "40784": "What is the good of all this romancing?",
  "40785": "Why on earth not?",
  "40786": "Montmartre?",
  "40787": "What occasions?",
  "40788": "Know not the living that the grave will swallow them up after a life of sadness and cruel misery?",
  "40789": "So, with the springtime, what was more likely than that the wild idea of escaping had come to him?",
  "40790": "He stopped hard by me, and asked if I knew who he was?",
  "40791": "What could be inside it?",
  "40792": "She is your daughter?",
  "40793": "Where could it a come from?",
  "40794": "A murderous attack?",
  "40795": "Has this place any local appellation?",
  "40796": "Shall I strike it, sir?",
  "40797": "Why do you talk to me like this?",
  "40798": "What can he do here?",
  "40799": "You're not racing?",
  "40800": "Shall it lie unproductive in the public vaults?",
  "40801": "What are you looking at now?",
  "40802": "Why went he there?",
  "40803": "Oh, is that all?",
  "40804": "Or is this not true, is there no such thing as pure accident?",
  "40805": "Alas, who shall now comfort the good margrave's wife?",
  "40806": "That book is quite closed?",
  "40807": "What do you expect me to say?",
  "40808": "Am I?",
  "40809": "Are you happy?",
  "40810": "Why all this coldness, O my best beloved?",
  "40811": "Well, but where have you left the ladies?",
  "40812": "Have you come to meet me?",
  "40813": "And suppose that they were to attack the upper part of the balloon, what would you do?",
  "40814": "May I beg your pardon again, if I inquire what you mean, sir?",
  "40815": "Leave?",
  "40816": "Ever, as long as you live?",
  "40817": "Was ever such an account of a dynasty given?",
  "40818": "Is the cloth taken?",
  "40819": "Adam?",
  "40820": "How did you receive that wound on your face?",
  "40821": "But what did you do yesterday after you left me?",
  "40822": "And the harmonious soul is both temperate and courageous?",
  "40823": "Now, how should I, that ne'er have squealed in your sty, know all the swine therein?",
  "40824": "And what do you suppose it's made of?",
  "40825": "I wonder what's become of her?",
  "40826": "Would you have your husband constantly at your feet?",
  "40827": "Where shall you be yourself?",
  "40828": "Are not the young people growing up today, really dead before they have a chance to live?",
  "40829": "How many times have I told you to tell me at once?",
  "40830": "Is not that so?",
  "40831": "Is it more afflicting to him to leave the graves of his fathers than it is to our brothers and children?",
  "40832": "Do you think it is nonsense?",
  "40833": "And what of passion, or spirit?",
  "40834": "And will you punish him because he cannot become so?",
  "40835": "To you alone, then, may I confide my sorrows and my hopes?",
  "40836": "Now, what do you complain of?",
  "40837": "Shall I be believed?",
  "40838": "Well, and what good would that be?",
  "40839": "How do you propose to deal with the case, sir?",
  "40840": "AIN' dat gay?",
  "40841": "It was you, then, that hit me?",
  "40842": "Who is this?",
  "40843": "What amount is wanting?",
  "40844": "Do all your people grow on bushes?",
  "40845": "Were all the infinitely numerous kinds of animals and plants created as eggs or seed, or as full grown?",
  "40846": "And what is one?",
  "40847": "What the deuce are you driving at now?",
  "40848": "To some old hag?",
  "40849": "Who's he?",
  "40850": "Did she?",
  "40851": "Do you think he'll give us a good ride?",
  "40852": "Then how used you it?",
  "40853": "Shall it be the bride or bridegroom?",
  "40854": "Will he be poison'd with a simile?",
  "40855": "Where are we going to now?",
  "40856": "What, CAPITAL?",
  "40857": "But how shall I leave him dreeft?",
  "40858": "Was she, indeed?",
  "40859": "What am I to do, then?",
  "40860": "Amicable?",
  "40861": "Oh, why did I not tell you all?",
  "40862": "How, if that be so?",
  "40863": "That she ought to go back?",
  "40864": "Possible, my dear?",
  "40865": "Do you want to fight it?",
  "40866": "Have you anything further to say about your friend?",
  "40867": "But what know they more than we ?",
  "40868": "Why do artists, like mechanics, find the means to live?",
  "40869": "Can this be another vengeance of that woman?",
  "40870": "What did he want?",
  "40871": "My new blue coat as I've got on?",
  "40872": "Are you satisfied?",
  "40873": "Was ever such bad luck and such bad management, too?",
  "40874": "What is the fact?",
  "40875": "Where's that huntsman from?",
  "40876": "Why should he leave the comet?",
  "40877": "Would he be in soon?",
  "40878": "Is it her mother you're going to take her to?",
  "40879": "Whatever shall I do?",
  "40880": "What can be the signification of the uneven shrugging of her hulchy shoulders?",
  "40881": "And had he not moved her?",
  "40882": "But are they fully known?",
  "40883": "Secondly, what will satisfy you for the trouble of producing it?",
  "40884": "My dear cousin, can you be satisfied with such a way of spending your probation?",
  "40885": "D'you want to wash?",
  "40886": "Why, what nonsense are you telling us?",
  "40887": "Do you seek any promise from me?",
  "40888": "Or is he dead?",
  "40889": "Parry, is that all?",
  "40890": "What were they about?",
  "40891": "Only a bullet?",
  "40892": "And now that she did own it, what should be her course?",
  "40893": "Now, if competition cannot by itself become the common condition, why should not those for whom it offers nothing but perils, exact guarantees from the barons whom they serve?",
  "40894": "Would its citizens approve of its doing so?",
  "40895": "These relics have a history then?",
  "40896": "This screaming mob, are they, or are they not, my subjects?",
  "40897": "Would it be much out of the way, to take me in, near the great cathedral door between the two towers?",
  "40898": "But how came you to tell me that he was so disagreeable?",
  "40899": "And how did you regulate the matter, let me know?",
  "40900": "Why have you gone out of your mind, like this?",
  "40901": "We may venture on a contest with them, may we not?",
  "40902": "And not talebearers either?",
  "40903": "Is she like him?",

  "41040": "Does your mother wash?",
  "41041": "What would you have done if you had had to go into the army, to go and fight beneath the standard?",
  "41042": "Tom, do you believe the man I gave the money to, is really implicated in this crime?",
  "41043": "And whom have you for an advocate?",
  "41044": "Where are you?",

  "41293": "May I go across with you?",
  "41294": "Why cannot I now, as three months ago, draw fresh moral strength from your look, so gentle, calm, and penetrating, a look I loved so well and seem to see before me as I write?",
  "41295": "What use is it for mothers to say anything?",
  "41296": "A bit of shadowing, maybe, or such like?",
  "41297": "Have you ever experienced religion?",
  "41298": "Is it hard to know?",
  "41299": "I am, then, your prisoner?",
  "41300": "What is the use of seeing me after we have made all our arrangements?",
  "41301": "What quality?",
  "41302": "And will nothing be done to them?",
  "41303": "Ever been in prison?",
  "41304": "Take what?",
  "41305": "Why should I do it?",
  "41306": "Mine, sir?",
  "41307": "What is there against him?",
  "41308": "Now where shall we put this most excellent man?",
  "41309": "Or should I seek for a good price and sell it?",
  "41310": "How much did you say he took?",
  "41311": "Win anything?",
  "41312": "Have you got what you looked for?",
  "41313": "Where are their females?",
  "41314": "Will not it come of its own accord when I am a woman grown?",
  "41315": "What sweets are we going to have?",
  "41316": "Say you have not?",
  "41317": "Or, on the other hand, might it not be attracted to the great central source of light and heat, and be absorbed in it?",
  "41318": "But where shall we find him?",
  "41319": "S'pose they'd have me thar?",
  "41320": "What was that you said about seeing someone up there on top of the hill?",
  "41321": "And you will not take my advice?",
  "41322": "Had he resisted, and been overcome in the struggle?",
  "41323": "Why was he able to stand in the place of the scarecrow, hidden by nothing but an old hat?",
  "41324": "Who would not have expected them to be insipid likenesses of each other?",
  "41325": "What has he said to you?",
  "41326": "That is no business of yours either, is it?",
  "41327": "That I was so happy as I was?",
  "41328": "Which of us is happy in this world?",
  "41329": "Where do you think to go to?",
  "41330": "Why did he come in?",
  "41331": "How long before?",
  "41332": "Why will you ask him in terms that he does not comprehend?",
  "41333": "And shall I ever neglect her, or hurt her, or even forget to consider her?",
  "41334": "Well, how is he?",
  "41335": "Among the patrons, I suppose?",
  "41336": "Am I, then, so very revolting?",
  "41337": "Ought I to vanish?",
  "41338": "You have that in the house, I suppose?",
  "41339": "Where are you taking us to?",
  "41340": "Whither was he to flee from universal famine?",
  "41341": "And have you handed in the petition?",
  "41342": "I mean, are you going to stay on in your cottage?",
  "41343": "May I have the use of your skiff?",
  "41344": "Are you the knight who came every day to the festival, always in different colours, and who caught the three golden apples?",
  "41345": "What sin of mine could merit such a rod?",
  "41346": "Do you even know whether higher prices for articles of luxury would not be an obstacle to the cheapness of necessary objects, and whether, in trying to favor the most numerous class, you would not render the general condition worse?",
  "41347": "Indeed?",
  "41348": "When shall we be there?",
  "41349": "And if they were able to converse with one another, would they not suppose that they were naming what was actually before them?",
  "41350": "What's your name, boy?",
  "41351": "Why does my blood rush into a hell of tumult at a few words?",
  "41352": "But you still know each other?",
  "41353": "But in what does a strong association between a word and an idea differ from a weak one?",
  "41354": "And wha will glove my hand?",
  "41355": "And how is this accomplished well except by general principles, some about the nature of the universe, and others about the proper constitution of man?",
  "41356": "Do you wonder that I avow this to you?",
  "41357": "You like that better than all your playthings, eh?",
  "41358": "Yet why be afraid?",
  "41359": "Do you find any dazzling sensation before the eyes?",
  "41360": "It's the right one, I suppose?",
  "41361": "And why wonder at that?",
  "41362": "Why, what is a silhouette party?",
  "41363": "How do you mean, I too?",
  "41364": "What sort of a fatality, in short, is that which is contradicted every instant by the facts which take place within its bosom?",
  "41365": "And do you really love him quite well enough?",
  "41366": "But how did these women bear themselves amid toils so arduous?",
  "41367": "Volumnia, do I make myself intelligible?",
  "41368": "Is all the spilt wine swallowed?",
  "41369": "And where is that letter?",
  "41370": "What would become of his wife if he should be convicted?",
  "41371": "He who had ever been so good to her, why had he now failed her so grievously?",
  "41372": "Why do you torture me?",
  "41373": "You are great friends, eh, all together?",
  "41374": "Do you find any trouble or disquiet in your body by the importunate stings and pricklings of the flesh?",
  "41375": "Well, then, where do we dine?",
  "41376": "Find we no cure for wounds?",
  "41377": "Where did you go?",
  "41378": "Ah, how would she feel then?",
  "41379": "Did he wear a vest?",
  "41380": "Now, do you honestly think they can?",
  "41381": "What is its breadth?",
  "41382": "It's a bad business, eh?",
  "41383": "Do you waltz?",
  "41384": "Have you no place you call a parlour?",
  "41385": "You never intended really to propose to go with me to the altar, and then make yourself rich by one great perjury?",
  "41386": "How could I?",
  "41387": "Are you content with yourself and with your life?",
  "41388": "And what does the author mean to do?",
  "41389": "Was it intentionally?",
  "41390": "May I ask your reason for such an insulting supposition, sir?",
  "41391": "What was the force of that army?",
  "41392": "But of what?",
  "41393": "Do you know where we are going?",
  "41394": "What's the use of it?",
  "41395": "What year?",
  "41396": "But, woe is me, wherefore do I complain?",
  "41397": "Have you a garden of your own?",
  "41398": "Why is not this principle universal?",
  "41399": "And was the sum a large one?",
  "41400": "Why, we are all mortal, are we not?",
  "41401": "Philip, how can you be so unkind?",
  "41402": "Where is he now?",
  "41403": "Will your majesty please proceed?",
  "41404": "And, besides, what is paying it but submission to tyranny?",
  "41405": "But why all this secrecy?",
  "41406": "Oh, gosh?",
  "41407": "Not much in the habit of such travelling yourself, I think, sir?",
  "41408": "But what's the matter with you?",
  "41409": "Besides, what could you have to tell me?",
  "41410": "You know that you are recalled to life?",
  "41411": "Will she be back soon?",
  "41412": "Airing yourself, as I am doing, before you go to bed?",
  "41413": "And the sometime greater to the sometime less, and the greater that is to be to the less that is to be?",
  "41414": "Is the hand not always pointing there?",
  "41415": "But who was the spy who stole the papers?",
  "41416": "So it's 'Eat my dear birdies,' is it, young man?",
  "41417": "And yet the cardinal was attached to you?",
  "41418": "Can any woman alive believe you in earnest, or think you design anything but to banter her?",
  "41419": "But, such being the case, where could you have heard the same report?",
  "41420": "Why had he not told her everything?",
  "41421": "Who is that BRAHMA?",
  "41422": "What offence did I commit?",
  "41423": "Where am I to find them?",
  "41424": "What paper have you written for?",
  "41425": "How should the leman of a vassal become a king's wife?",
  "41426": "Where are you from?",
  "41427": "Is it he?",
  "41428": "And these other instruments, the use of which I cannot guess?",
  "41429": "She will pay, only when?",
  "41430": "Do you mean write it to her?",
  "41431": "How do you make that out?",
  "41432": "Russian books, indeed ?",
  "41433": "Will you walk in, sir?",
  "41434": "To whom then?",
  "41435": "You prefer to stay here and imagine that all the world is gaping at your pictures?",
  "41436": "What know I of the minister's heart?",
  "41437": "And why among us four?",
  "41438": "You were looking for me out of the window?",
  "41439": "Has he not already forgotten she ever existed?",
  "41440": "Is he not solid gold?",
  "41441": "What are their secret counsels?",
  "41442": "Who'll say a guinea?",
  "41443": "Do you think I particularly like you?",
  "41444": "Who is he, my dear?",
  "41445": "And did you?",
  "41446": "Shall I ever know any thing?",
  "41447": "Where is that murderer?",
  "41448": "Oh, is it broken?",
  "41449": "And is there no room for love there?",
  "41450": "For not alluding to your leaving us?",
  "41451": "What then must be the result?",
  "41452": "What is all settled?",
  "41453": "Saw you those meteors?",
  "41454": "And what will that good treatment be?",
  "41455": "Well, but is there any war on record which was carried on successfully by him, or aided by his counsels, when he was alive?",
  "41456": "Do you want a map?",
  "41457": "But what other is there?",
  "41458": "You understand the rest, then?",
  "41459": "Where were we?",
  "41460": "Would you have 'em both before marriage?",
  "41461": "Why was it?",
  "41462": "What made you choose that particular direction?",
  "41463": "Then the cost of this vessel is great?",
  "41464": "Socrates, has taken possession of you all?",
  "41465": "Have you seen for YOUR self?",
  "41466": "Bore me, my dear?",
  "41467": "How can I ever pay you?",
  "41468": "Give me one little sip more, and tell me from whom you received the noble gift?",
  "41469": "But the orders?",
  "41470": "How here?",
  "41471": "Did he not, my dear father and mother, deserve all the truth to be told?",
  "41472": "You think that likely?",
  "41473": "Can we not better make the attempt after dark?",
  "41474": "Carver, you DO think him witty?",
  "41475": "Giry?",
  "41476": "Why are they leaving the town?",
  "41477": "What is the meaning of that noise?",
  "41478": "And did you go alone?",
  "41479": "What good wind brings you here?",
  "41480": "And if he were dead, to what height of fury would not the violence of the people lash the legionaries?",
  "41481": "You see I am generous, am I not, mother?",
  "41482": "What charm has gone from the twilight?",
  "41483": "What is it, sir?",
  "41484": "And what brought you here?",
  "41485": "Could he have any, do you suppose?",
  "41486": "FOOD FOR THE VULTURES?",
  "41487": "Is it as nice as it sounds?",
  "41488": "You're no wiser than the rest of us, are you?",
  "41489": "Still dreaming and staring?",
  "41490": "How dare you say such things about me?",
  "41491": "Is it not true that legists are governed by caprice in giving and taking away rights?",
  "41492": "Will you go over and get some canned peaches?",
  "41493": "Do not you think that if I were about any king, proposing good laws to him, and endeavouring to root out all the cursed seeds of evil that I found in him, I should either be turned out of his court, or, at least, be laughed at for my pains?",
  "41494": "And you heard nothing, and saw nothing?",
  "41495": "When did he go to church last?",
  "41496": "Which then shall we prefer?",
  "41497": "What more inconstant than the desires of man?",
  "41498": "And you obeyed?",
  "41499": "Which should he take?",
  "41500": "What's the matter?",
  "41501": "Does it not make you shudder?",
  "41502": "What infernal noise?",
  "41503": "Jellyby's?",
  "41504": "Do any of you know of one?",
  "41505": "They did not, and why not?",
  "41506": "When do you leave town?",
  "41507": "He knows what YOU know?",
  "41508": "What are you bothering him for?",
  "41509": "What can it be?",
  "41510": "How, sir?",
  "41511": "Whom shall we call, lest spectres should appear?",
  "41512": "Differently?",
  "41513": "And how am I to cross?",
  "41514": "But what am I going to eat?",
  "41515": "How often am I to call you?",
  "41516": "Is it not a source of mortification to a class of men that they are excluded from political power?",
  "41517": "Do you see this parcel?",
  "41518": "A murder do you call it?",
  "41519": "Who does not love you?",
  "41520": "And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?",
  "41521": "How like you her wit?",
  "41522": "Have you got anything of your own?",
  "41523": "But where are the folk?",
  "41524": "But shall I not use tobacco at all?",
  "41525": "Will you never be done getting me into trouble?",
  "41526": "Françoise, all these young fellows not caring two straws for their lives?",
  "41527": "Why, tell me, said he, what answer you would make?",
  "41528": "What can be done with four?",
  "41529": "Was he not contented with his children?",
  "41530": "Can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws?",
  "41531": "You have nothing more to say?",
  "41532": "And, as he so resolved, he could not but ask himself the question, whether the charge of the parish ought to be left in the hands of such a man?",
  "41533": "You told him that?",
  "41534": "Would you advise me, whilst able to fight, to throw the arms I hold in my hand to the ground?",
  "41535": "Now, what do you want with me?",
  "41536": "What are people planning against him?",
  "41537": "Forever a footman?",
  "41538": "But where are we, uncle?",
  "41539": "Who forced my hand, as was the lawful cap'n?",
  "41540": "Will your majesty do me the honor to explain yourself?",
  "41541": "Who could this young woman be, I wonder?",
  "41542": "The beginning of what?",
  "41543": "Why does the theatre draw me so that I am willing to sacrifice for it even those I love?",
  "41544": "Can you remember?",
  "41545": "What should ail them?",
  "41546": "But why should these rough drafts of letters be regarded as anything else than what they actually and obviously are?",
  "41547": "Why had he married the eyes in the photograph?",
  "41548": "Ned, my dear fellow, will you mention what we agreed upon?",
  "41549": "Do you know what that is?",
  "41550": "Was he satisfied?",
  "41551": "Have you been for a soldier?",
  "41552": "Where are the brothers?",
  "41553": "He whom your aunt intends for you?",
  "41554": "I was to leave town the next day for a fortnight's absence, and whom had they to see to them?",
  "41555": "What do I ask now?",
  "41556": "What shall we do for dessert?",
  "41557": "Who do you give your casting vote to?",
  "41558": "How is it that this difference happens?",
  "41559": "But do you only labour at the graves of children, and young people?",
  "41560": "What became of the two men?",
  "41561": "And has not the body itself less of truth and essence than the soul?",
  "41562": "Better?",
  "41563": "You came straight here?",
  "41564": "She did, hey?",
  "41565": "All of us?",
  "41566": "Shall we turn back, or run into a cottage?",
  "41567": "Why did his condition improve?",
  "41568": "How was it?",
  "41569": "Will they permit me to enter?",
  "41570": "And if it is not sorcery, what is it, then?",
  "41571": "Was she lying?",
  "41572": "Why do you kneel to me?",
  "41573": "Jane, are you ready?",
  "41574": "Then you suppose it was the people alone who wished to burn the condemned?",
  "41575": "Is it a strict moral obligation?",
  "41576": "Who came hither?",
  "41577": "How will you judge the counterfeit, if you have no guarantee?",
  "41578": "Damn it now, what's his name?",
  "41579": "And stealing yet more blessed than taking?",
  "41580": "Is there ony room at your feet?",
  "41581": "May I count on you?",
  "41582": "And where am I to sit?",
  "41583": "Where has she taken refuge?",
  "41584": "Why should I go to see them, therefore?",
  "41585": "And if he found them differing as much from one another as from his first counsellors, would he not act prudently in trying the experiment unanimously recommended by the latter, rather than be hearkening to those who could neither deny the necessity of a speedy remedy, nor agree in proposing one?",
  "41586": "Are there not the unjust who are fortunate, while the just are unfortunate?",
  "41587": "What would he think of me, of my lack of will?",
  "41588": "Is the imp altogether evil?",
  "41589": "In this new revolution thus established forever, who shall decide which is the sun and which is the moon?",
  "41590": "Of THEMSELVES?",
  "41591": "What are you saying to me?",
  "41592": "What is yonder?",
  "41593": "When did you lie, the last time or now?",
  "41594": "Did he live his life again in every detail of desire, temptation, and surrender during that supreme moment of complete knowledge?",
  "41595": "Did you see him?",
  "41596": "What prompted me then to disturb the memory of the buried dead?",
  "41597": "How shall we destroy him?",
  "41598": "Am I not your mother also?",
  "41599": "And the bridegroom?",
  "41600": "What are young men to rocks and mountains?",
  "41601": "I am her father, am I not?",
  "41602": "Going to be in town long?",
  "41603": "But when will that be?",
  "41604": "But what have I done to you?",
  "41605": "Yours is a long life to look back upon, sir?",
  "41606": "Then it was you?",
  "41607": "Why have you come?",
  "41608": "And that we may dismiss you to the moor and the rainy night?",
  "41609": "Will it come off?",
  "41610": "Why is there so much negation and abnegation in your hearts?",
  "41611": "And is there any greater or keener pleasure than that of sensual love?",
  "41612": "You know the consequences of mixing them?",
  "41613": "When have I been hash, tell me?",
  "41614": "Did you think a gentleman would be likely to take any interest in you?",
  "41615": "But what reference has that to me?",
  "41616": "You were her first love?",
  "41617": "Who were they?",
  "41618": "Yet why a second venture try?",
  "41619": "Do you want him to be fond of you?",
  "41620": "Where would you go?",
  "41621": "What advantages had she?",
  "41622": "Well, how has all gone off?",
  "41623": "Do we pay no money?",
  "41624": "What weapon would he choose?",
  "41625": "Why did he not go on?",
  "41626": "What will you take for it?",
  "41627": "Anything for me?",
  "41628": "What is there more?",
  "41629": "Is your majesty satisfied to see the earl and the queen make their appearance at this meeting?",
  "41630": "What possessed you to tell those stories about my saddle, and the hats and boots, and all the rest of it?",
  "41631": "Perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him?",
  "41632": "Was I, then, not yet aware that what I felt, myself, for her, depended neither upon her actions nor upon my desires?",
  "41633": "Even as a man who rides a horse is called a horseman?",
  "41634": "Not to me, I hope?",
  "41635": "Has he any objection to make to them which would justify him in overturning them?",
  "41636": "A young gentleman, is he not?",
  "41637": "But have you reflected seriously?",
  "41638": "Is this your indifference, your uninteresting conversation?",
  "41639": "Then one may smoke on board?",
  "41640": "Why should not she be a maid of honor, as well as myself?",
  "41641": "What will come out of those three elements when I am no longer present to combine them?",
  "41642": "Stopping here?",
  "41643": "Sed?",
  "41644": "It appears then that the world judge correctly, why should you be ashamed of their favorable judgment?",
  "41645": "As princes of the blood, in fact?",
  "41646": "What, faithless?",
  "41647": "What else do you want?",
  "41648": "May I help you off with your helmet?",
  "41649": "Why has she been crying?",
  "41650": "What can they have done with him?",
  "41651": "Do you love me, then?",
  "41652": "Will they neither obey nor make room for those who will?",
  "41653": "At what point shall we expect the approach of danger?",
  "41654": "But shall not we, ourselves, the truth maintain?",
  "41655": "My dear, do you see?",
  "41656": "But, after all, what is this metaphor called a crown, or rather what is monarchy?",
  "41657": "Is the aggregate power of the general government greater than ought to have been vested in it?",
  "41658": "Do you doubt them?",
  "41659": "Would you take a creature that has not a groat in the world?",
  "41660": "And that other gentleman?",
  "41661": "What would your excellency like to eat?",
  "41662": "How much do a king git?",
  "41663": "How many times?",
  "41664": "Why should she not be his?",
  "41665": "How do you maintain discipline among your men?",
  "41666": "And are you going to have no breakfast or dinner today?",
  "41667": "What make do you like?",
  "41668": "Where are you going, old fellow?",
  "41669": "What is the bridge for?",
  "41670": "You think I was concerned in the plot which brought about the rupture, do you not?",
  "41671": "Who was by him at night?",
  "41672": "Fit, I hope?",
  "41673": "Less than two minutes?",
  "41674": "Nor lay before your eyes what afflictions you yourselves have undergone?",
  "41675": "Mind?",
  "41676": "Suppose, then, a man speak an idle word, and die suddenly, before he has time to repent and confess his sin, will he be lost everlastingly?",
  "41677": "You were also married before you had this wife?",
  "41678": "Was the cause of death mentioned?",
  "41679": "The little princess?",
  "41680": "And that door is locked?",
  "41681": "Yes, or no?",
  "41682": "Found what?",
  "41683": "Why do you give the poor fellow no hope?",
  "41684": "Ah, what have you done to me?",
  "41685": "But what in the name of goodness could provoke you to tempt your fate so long?",

  "42479": "Shall I draw the curtain?",
  "42480": "How comes it, that having both a sister and an adopted son, you have never spoken to me of either?",
  "42481": "Was I free again or a prisoner?",
  "42482": "What does the animal say?",
  "42483": "Would not one of these have served, do you think, sir?",
  "42484": "I surely am entitled to draw my pay from time to time to cover my expenditure?",
  "42485": "Do you want them this evening?",
  "42486": "How can there be a possibility that they were not cognizant and approving of his acts?",
  "42487": "An abdication?",
  "42488": "Who ARE you talking to?",
  "42489": "With what?",
  "42490": "What statesman in all history has done anything calling for so wide a view and for a purpose more lofty?",
  "42491": "Was it possible for any one to hide behind the tombstones?",
  "42492": "Is there no danger to liberty itself in discarding the earliest practice and first precept of our ancient faith?",
  "42493": "Unless you get your eight hours, where are you?",
  "42494": "My assassins?",
  "42495": "What will become of me?",
  "42496": "Who would willingly call them from their sheeted sleep?",
  "42497": "Would it send them along through space at enormous speed?",
  "42498": "What is it, then?",
  "42499": "Why should you go?",
  "42500": "No?",
  "42501": "What may they be?",
  "42502": "You here?",
  "42503": "And as for your poor arm, what difference will that make?",
  "42504": "You know what this is, of course?",
  "42505": "Tell me, then, what is that of which the inherence will render the body alive?",
  "42506": "But you do not intend to sell your diamonds, I suppose, madame?",
  "42507": "But your eminence?",
  "42508": "Pain?",
  "42509": "Say you are not sorry that you loved me?",
  "42510": "If people wanted a barn earnestly enough to take the trouble of building one, why was it not worth while to keep the thing in proper repair?",
  "42511": "I hope that I have said nothing to pain you?",
  "42512": "But who did sleep with you?",
  "42513": "Are you going far, if I may take the liberty to ask?",
  "42514": "Ferdishenko, just step out and order some more champagne, will you?",
  "42515": "Are the economists in a position to effect this elimination?",
  "42516": "Surely we are quite out of the road?",
  "42517": "Are there not many little things in your home life that you can improve upon?",
  "42518": "From what country?",
  "42519": "Is there anyone else you could be?",
  "42520": "What meant the giving of the crucifix, of the garlic, of the wild rose, of the mountain ash?",
  "42521": "Where are you pushing to, you fiends?",
  "42522": "Do you wish me to give her up?",
  "42523": "At what hour do they hang them, monsieur, if you please?",
  "42524": "To my last sin?",
  "42525": "It does not tell us very much, does it?",
  "42526": "Now then, you naughty girl, what have you been doing to yourself?",
  "42527": "Have you not seen him?",
  "42528": "Will your majesty permit me to open the window?",
  "42529": "Did I wake you up?",
  "42530": "Do you pity him?",
  "42531": "Not rabbits?",
  "42532": "What strengthens your belief?",
  "42533": "What matters it?",
  "42534": "What would he do, whether or not?",
  "42535": "But what is the meaning of it all?",
  "42536": "Well, what do you wish me to do?",
  "42537": "Where is my father?",
  "42538": "And how did you recognize me?",
  "42539": "Should we be long permitted to remain in the quiet and undisturbed enjoyment of a metropolis, from the possession of which we derived an advantage so odious to our neighbors, and, in their opinion, so oppressive?",
  "42540": "Was not he kin that fell upon our side?",
  "42541": "Philip, how can you say anything so unkind?",
  "42542": "And what with?",
  "42543": "Or if it was partly, was it wholly and entirely?",
  "42544": "Even poor, giddy, stupid me?",
  "42545": "Have you been at the trouble of writing all that, and am I not to read it after all?",
  "42546": "What do I do, with the mirror?",
  "42547": "Have you read it?",
  "42548": "Well, and how was the old woman?",
  "42549": "Who, I?",
  "42550": "What kind of bird may it be, pray?",
  "42551": "A dog?",
  "42552": "I think the worse of him?",
  "42553": "What woman was it you were dreaming about?",
  "42554": "What is there practical or rational in the present excitement?",
  "42555": "Had he not just gotten a job, and become a sharer in all this activity, a cog in this marvelous machine?",
  "42556": "Did you hear, eternal sleeper?",
  "42557": "What shall I do about it?",
  "42558": "And you did not intercede for him?",
  "42559": "When saw you my niece?",
  "42560": "And, therefore, you would wish to see them brought together?",
  "42561": "You are acquainted with the cardinal's will, then?",
  "42562": "Have you never seen any one enter your room at night?",
  "42563": "If I marry t'oother dear lass, there's a law to punish me?",
  "42564": "But will it be possible for me to find you?",
  "42565": "And has he forgotten his ideal?",
  "42566": "Are you going to stay here yourself?",
  "42567": "Yet, another mug of beer?",
  "42568": "Are we to sneak into the kitchen, as if we came after the forks?",
  "42569": "And are you, in truth, highly magnified?",
  "42570": "Why do you not affirm him?",
  "42571": "What about her?",
  "42572": "And what, think you, does my father feel at this moment?",
  "42573": "Is this playing the game properly?",
  "42574": "But where is the doctor?",
  "42575": "And sit out with him, I suppose?",
  "42576": "What of it?",
  "42577": "Seems we're not going to sleep, then?",
  "42578": "Am I not a man and a brother?",
  "42579": "Are you afraid?",
  "42580": "Champion?",
  "42581": "Match?",
  "42582": "How did you happen to be here?",
  "42583": "Is not such the doom of all speculative men of talent?",
  "42584": "But what does it mean?",
  "42585": "Why, what has he in him of such virtue to be regarded, ha?",
  "42586": "Get on, will you?",
  "42587": "Yea, forsooth?",
  "42588": "And, considering the question of human happiness, where, oh where does it reside?",
  "42589": "Aramis?",
  "42590": "But why do you not rise and greet your guest?",
  "42591": "Why did you not give up that lewd habit, that impure habit?",
  "42592": "So that's it, is it?",
  "42593": "Where do you fish, my friends?",
  "42594": "Is he the same toward the other mummies in the house?",
  "42595": "Who's the next?",
  "42596": "But are you seriously wounded?",
  "42597": "But can it last?",
  "42598": "Why should she fight against every admission until it was forced from her?",
  "42599": "Well, who knows?",
  "42600": "Whether they or their judges had any part in penning those laws, which they assumed the liberty of interpreting, and glossing upon at their pleasure?",
  "42601": "And what the spirit that leads us wants TO BE CALLED?",
  "42602": "What has he made me suffer?",
  "42603": "Who made it?",
  "42604": "What is it you want me to do?",
  "42605": "What on earth became of all these people?",
  "42606": "Or would he spread bat's wings and flee away, looking so much the uglier the higher he rose towards heaven?",
  "42607": "Are you confirmed in your impression?",
  "42608": "Do you think they will grant it?",
  "42609": "Which is the way?",
  "42610": "When must I leave?",
  "42611": "Is that you?",
  "42612": "Yet, what can the votary be justly said to have lost of his present happiness?",
  "42613": "Or what other reason can we ever assign for these affections, but the original fabric and formation of the human mind, which is naturally adapted to receive them?",
  "42614": "And yet, what is life worth to you if you be deprived of these enjoyments?",
  "42615": "Are they here?",
  "42616": "What matters it, if you avoid them?",
  "42617": "With the girl and all?",
  "42618": "You have had your eye on the business, my young friend, have you?",
  "42619": "Does the body correspond so immediately with the spirit?",
  "42620": "And what are you going to buy for it?",
  "42621": "And therefore, previously?",
  "42622": "And long ago?",
  "42623": "How much?",
  "42624": "A name?",
  "42625": "Or that induces the patriot to die for his country?",
  "42626": "To carry this accusing witness about with me everywhere?",
  "42627": "Then I must give up the idea?",
  "42628": "Is it intelligent?",
  "42629": "What good, pray, would this do you?",
  "42630": "Do you doubt my being what I always have been to you?",
  "42631": "How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love?",
  "42632": "Was it all real?",
  "42633": "Am I right behind, mama?",
  "42634": "George?",
  "42635": "But do you not admire, I said, the coolness and dexterity of these ready ministers of political corruption?",
  "42636": "Was he fair or dark?",
  "42637": "Would you?",
  "42638": "Do you agree to it?",
  "42639": "It was the cardinal, then, who informed you of this fete?",
  "42640": "Can you really remember it all?",
  "42641": "Angina?",
  "42642": "Then he said, she came from the country, he saw?",
  "42643": "And see the blue heron by the lotus flowers?",
  "42644": "Oh, you are, are you?",
  "42645": "Was it soil?",
  "42646": "Is it not a pitiful sight?",
  "42647": "How did you make your way in here?",
  "42648": "D'you call life a bad job?",
  "42649": "You will not be my comforter, my rescuer?",
  "42650": "And who were the others?",
  "42651": "Do you understand?",
  "42652": "How much does he spend yearly?",
  "42653": "O, was it no otherwise?",
  "42654": "How could I doubt such a thing?",
  "42655": "How many children have you got, ma'am?",
  "42656": "Why not, if you like it?",
  "42657": "How dare you cross my threshold?",
  "42658": "You'll like that?",
  "42659": "And is her name a secret?",
  "42660": "Uneasy?",
  "42661": "But how came you upon the roof, man?",
  "42662": "La sakes, now, does it?",
  "42663": "Hear you?",
  "42664": "Will they never cease to expect corn from tares, and figs from thistles?",
  "42665": "Why SHOULD you hold out forever?",
  "42666": "Then what was it?",
  "42667": "Else, why should it be let so cheaply?",
  "42668": "Is it possible that there can be many such people on earth?",
  "42669": "And might a man be thirsty, and yet unwilling to drink?",
  "42670": "What is the secret, then?",
  "42671": "But was it on her own account, or on account of another, that she exposed herself to such hazards?",
  "42672": "Shall I tell YOU?",
  "42673": "Whuzzamatter wiz you, hey?",
  "42674": "And you have heard his fortune mentioned?",
  "42675": "Is there in the world, anything outside of the tribunals, executory sentences, the police and the authorities?",
  "42676": "Yeobright?",
  "42677": "Do you accept the wager?",
  "42678": "Now, who the deuce do I know?",
  "42679": "Very well, sir, what next?",
  "42680": "Can it be possible to see anything equal to what we have seen?",
  "42681": "Ha, what is he, man?",
  "42682": "You are pretty strong, eh?",
  "42683": "Why such a large land army?",
  "42684": "What is it my father does not know?",
  "42685": "Is their spiritual condition, I often wonder, much higher than their physical one?",
  "42686": "Heard what?",
  "42687": "Shall I describe his life to you?",
  "42688": "Would they stop short at the hairy cuticle, or would they attack the brain?",
  "42689": "How long then?",
  "42690": "My letter?",
  "42691": "Is he as soft as ever?",
  "42692": "You'll keep that?",
  "42693": "Where were you thinking of going?",
  "42694": "Do you hear the guns, pray?",
  "42695": "Should we not rather say JURISIGNORANCE?",
  "42696": "For what is it we call a man of birth, but one who is descended from a long succession of rich and powerful ancestors, and who acquires our esteem by his connexion with persons whom we esteem?",
  "42697": "But what about a thing like this?",
  "42698": "Was not that better than taking him prisoner?",
  "42699": "What was the name that he mentioned?",
  "42700": "Are you ready to be tested?",
  "42701": "How could I have exposed myself in their presence?",
  "42702": "Shall I see if we can manage that?",
  "42703": "Marguerite, CHERIE, what is it?",
  "42704": "Done?",
  "42705": "My dear archdeacon, who ever expected to see you?",
  "42706": "Why, have you not got any water?",
  "42707": "How could he hope to escape them?",
  "42708": "Here I have served him faithfully for years, and instead of allowing me to end my days comfortably and in peace, he is going to let me be cut up by the butcher, and my poor body is to be roasted and stewed and eaten?",
  "42709": "Now, how little do I look like being carried away trembling?",
  "42710": "To men who had risked their lives for him, and besides had done him a great service?",
  "42711": "What's the matter now?",
  "42712": "Is it to be so?",
  "42713": "This morning was it?",
  "42714": "What other thing do you think I could dream of doing?",
  "42715": "Which house is it?",
  "42716": "By whom?",
  "42717": "But has the problem been well put?",
  "42718": "Could any thing in womanhood be so vile?",
  "42719": "There were two parts in our former scheme of education, were there not?",
  "42720": "Shall I tell you what I always think of you and the fortune yet to come for you, my love?",
  "42721": "Who is the fellow?",
  "42722": "Pleased to be thus undeceived, I laughed at his consternation, and asked what brought him thither?",
  "42723": "Was he losing his reason and thinking he heard things which were not for human ears?",
  "42724": "How far may the idler take advantage of the laborer?",
  "42725": "Why are you going?",
  "42726": "Perhaps you could stop stuffing your nostrils with that dirty snuff?",
  "42727": "What became of the whales in that time?",
  "42728": "Who could attempt to pursue him?",
  "42729": "Genius banished?",
  "42730": "How dare I?",
  "42731": "Well, prince, whom are we to suspect, then?",
  "42732": "I think you had some good reason for giving up the habit of going there?",
  "42733": "What day of the month is it?",
  "42734": "Is he mad, then, that mysterious old fellow?",
  "42735": "But what sort of a sailor are you?",
  "42736": "Who can resist them?",
  "42737": "You think the count will be angry with me?",
  "42738": "But where?",
  "42739": "Did you ever hear the like?",
  "42740": "Who is this man?",
  "42741": "Who wishes you would?",
  "42742": "Is he here now?",
  "42743": "What was it you said to me?",
  "42744": "You in bed?",
  "42745": "Am I wanted?",
  "42746": "How came you to be here?",
  "42747": "Can they have gone out?",
  "42748": "Is it of being poor, forsaken, wretched, that you accuse me?",
  "42749": "Did it change her much?",
  "42750": "What was jour offence?",
  "42751": "Who forbade you?",
  "42752": "What is your name, my gentle angel?",
  "42753": "In the sunshine of the morning, beneath the wide, blue heavens, with a fresh wind astir, what fears, except the most desperate, can find a harbourage?",
  "42754": "So this is our minstrel?",
  "42755": "Yes, why should I stay here?",
  "42756": "Were you then permitted the use of pens, ink, and paper?",
  "42757": "What do you do?",
  "42758": "A dog, for instance?",
  "42759": "Can the cannon support the shock of the pyroxyle?",
  "42760": "Have I ever done that?",
  "42761": "Was there any large school near?",
  "42762": "But are they rich?",
  "42763": "What decision did he come to?",
  "42764": "How can I bear it?",
  "42765": "What am I to say to the creature?",
  "42766": "How would you like to be treated so?",
  "42767": "Is there any one closer to me nor you, or is it likely I'd be listening to stories brought against you?",
  "42768": "And can you not see, sir, the truth that's in me?",
  "42769": "Well, young fellow, are you glad to come to school?",
  "42770": "As how, good signior?",
  "42771": "Has not that been admitted?",
  "42772": "At a registrar's?",
  "42773": "Have you read this bulletin?",
  "42774": "He of whom I have such just apprehensions?",
  "42775": "Did a woman arrive at this place night before last?",
  "42776": "Does anything occur to yourself?",
  "42777": "Then what are they?",
  "42778": "Your father, eh?",
  "42779": "Have they not obeyed me?",
  "42780": "What have you got, broth, is it?",
  "42781": "Where are my amusements?",
  "42782": "What has a father to do with it?",
  "42783": "Do I take you with me?",
  "42784": "Do you understand the theory of that affair?",
  "42785": "Do you hear the way she'll be rating at your own self when a week is by?",
  "42786": "But, still, what sort of danger?",
  "42787": "No more than this?",
  "42788": "Where were the keys?",
  "42789": "Nobody know what this fudge can be?",
  "42790": "Come, what is it?",
  "42791": "Is loyalty too weak?",
  "42792": "What result, then, has ensued?",
  "42793": "Would not it be said by my presumptive remorse that, by my gallantry, manner and dress, I was going to seduce her?",
  "42794": "Never before?",
  "42795": "What do you mean, please, by my having 'done' with you?",
  "42796": "To who, sir?",
  "42797": "Did they try it on you?",
  "42798": "Are you thirsty?",
  "42799": "Will monseigneur give me the order?",
  "42800": "Where is the gardener's son now?",
  "42801": "Would it not be well that he should put an end to himself, and thus escape?",
  "42802": "Is it not generous of him?",
  "42803": "What is the matter with you?",
  "42804": "You hear them when the window is open?",
  "42805": "You can?",
  "42806": "Now, what is the good of driblets?",
  "42807": "I'm not come too soon, am I?",
  "42808": "In fact, this bullet must have issued from a firearm, and who but a human being could have used such a weapon?",
  "42809": "Then you sat there like that, just you and she, all by yourselves?",
  "42810": "Why have I not seen you?",
  "42811": "Do you guess the reason?",
  "42812": "Is the one right any better than the other?",
  "42813": "Am I cut off from the last fond pride of meanest shipwrecked captains?",
  "42814": "What is it, uncle?",
  "42815": "Is it my doing?",
  "42816": "To which dialect was he indebted?",
  "42817": "Can you play on the piano?",
  "42818": "You have no money coming in on which you can rely?",
  "42819": "From such a kind family?",
  "42820": "Why did you leave us?",
  "42821": "Who was there among all whom she knew to whom she could appeal for sympathy?",
  "42822": "Well, and you?",
  "42823": "Do I not know that, all the country round, men and woman are calling me the same behind my back?",
  "42824": "Who are these people on the side of the bill?",
  "42825": "But what is it, then?",
  "42826": "But who, then was this man?",
  "42827": "Then they do not know it yet?",
  "42828": "Be so kind as to walk home with him, will you?",
  "42829": "Richard?",
  "42830": "What is a prison?",
  "42831": "Are you sure?",
  "42832": "Oh, will you be quiet, and help me to carry her?",
  "42833": "Have you not read your bulletin?",
  "42834": "Shall domestic manufactures be encouraged, and in what degree, by restrictions on foreign manufactures?",
  "42835": "Or shall we say they may be continued as long as the danger which occasioned their being raised continues?",
  "42836": "Can you tell me any ill he has done?",
  "42837": "What is government?",
  "42838": "How could I forget?",
  "42839": "Hoo wor it?",
  "42840": "But why should they suppose that I despise generals?",
  "42841": "So both the brothers escaped the common fate?",
  "42842": "Where are we to live?",
  "42843": "What reason do they give?",
  "42844": "Do you suppose I want to shoot myself?",
  "42845": "Whether they were always so free from avarice, partialities, or want, that a bribe, or some other sinister view, could have no place among them?",
  "42846": "Is it not good?",
  "42847": "Was that a trick to make me say which one I prefer?",
  "42848": "And get enchanted again?",
  "42849": "Why not, if what you assert is untrue?",
  "42850": "What's the odds where it comes from?",
  "42851": "Could she go back to the former quiet pleasures of those faraway days before the concert?",
  "42852": "Well, will you go if I change my clothes?",
  "42853": "Oh, he mentioned his name, did he?",
  "42854": "Can you let me sit by the fire?",
  "42855": "Then how?",
  "42856": "How is it possible to hear her?",
  "42857": "How are we going to get back?",
  "42858": "Need you say it face to face?",
  "42859": "Wooster?",
  "42860": "Will he get used to it?",
  "42861": "Who may the four be?",
  "42862": "Do I look as if I liked it?",
  "42863": "Well, is it good?",
  "42864": "Then a man may feel for years that he is good solid company, and be wrong about himself after all?",
  "42865": "Are we only half way up?",
  "42866": "Pray, when, sir, shall I see you at my house?",
  "42867": "But when is this ball to take place?",
  "42868": "And my son?",
  "42869": "But will you gi'e me all the ground the goose flew over?",
  "42870": "Who denies you this right?",
  "42871": "What is the rule in such a case?",

  "42873": "Can you guess how he will be likely to behave towards his flatterers and his supposed parents, first of all during the period when he is ignorant of the false relation, and then again when he knows?",
  "42874": "If you see us among scores of women, will you look upon us?",
  "42875": "Where does the remainder go?",
  "42876": "Did any of you see him trailing us?",
  "42877": "And was he sure of what he said?",
  "42878": "I wrote to you for some grammars, if you recollect, and you sent them?",
  "42879": "But shall we go down and watch this absorbing match?",
  "42880": "My plans?",
  "42881": "And who had deserved the worst?",
  "42882": "Do you believe in my instinctive feelings?",
  "42883": "Are you sure I can get all the things I want there?",
  "42884": "On the front?",
  "42885": "Do you not see then, sire, that this is a covert and indirect accusation against yourself, and that while he praises pardoning love, he at the same time condemns and accuses your righteous and punitory wrath?",
  "42886": "Why weary, and palsy the arm at the oar, and the iron, and the lance?",
  "42887": "Her father, eh?",
  "42888": "What difference did it make?",
  "42889": "Are my purposes wont to be so shallow?",

  "42894": "Did you treat anybody, sir?",
  "42895": "May I?",
  "42896": "And why was I running after her?",
  "42897": "What if the acts he had reconciled himself to because they made him a stronger instrument of the divine glory, were to become the pretext of the scoffer, and a darkening of that glory?",

  "42942": "Eh?",
  "42943": "Have you made anything out of the tangle?",
  "42944": "Am I to be left here in my old age, not a rational soul to speak to, and no other place in the village where there's a drop of decent punch to be had?",
  "42945": "What are you making such a fuss about?",
  "42946": "Well, then, whom does it concern?",
  "42947": "Do you not deduce something from that?",
  "42948": "But who could have taken it?",
  "42949": "One figure whose movements you follow with at least curiosity?",
  "42950": "One?",

  "42955": "How long will you be with us?",
  "42956": "Does she know it?",
  "42957": "You heard of the duel?",
  "42958": "Can you show me the place as I go back?",
  "42959": "What else could I do?",
  "42960": "And do you think we have nothing to fear if we land?",
  "42961": "And are you going to make a fisherman of him?",
  "42962": "What kind of spectacle would its hidden hemisphere present to our terrestrial spheroid?",
  "42963": "Would you have doomed me, at any time, to the frost and blight that have hardened and spoiled me?",
  "42964": "A secret ambassador?",
  "42965": "Do you not constantly argue that this is not the right place to oppose it?",
  "42966": "Then you have some secret hope to buoy you up and please you with whispers of the future?",
  "42967": "But where are you hurrying now?",
  "42968": "You have the same eye to your own interest, that you always had, I doubt not?",
  "42969": "And how should you understand him?",
  "42970": "A coward?",
  "42971": "What have you done about it?",
  "42972": "What could he get by that?",
  "42973": "Do you know whom she reminds me of?",
  "42974": "The accusation?",
  "42975": "Now I ask, what idea do we form of these bodies or objects, to which we suppose solidity to belong?",
  "42976": "But am I in time?",
  "42977": "Will he not utterly hate a lie?",
  "42978": "I had the best of it this time?",
  "42979": "Can you understand the happiness I get out of my absinthe?",
  "42980": "How know you that?",
  "42981": "Now?",
  "42982": "And what kind of fool?",
  "42983": "Casaubon?",
  "42984": "Is it KETCHING?",
  "42985": "Can you wash dishes right?",
  "42986": "But do they not rather demonstrate the absence of a gang?",
  "42987": "Do you think I'm a presumptuous fool?",

  "42991": "Indeed, sir?",
  "42992": "Then the moon was once inhabited?",
  "42993": "Nothing the matter?",
  "42994": "Are we still under the sea?",
  "42995": "But tell me, how does he produce the appearance of death?",
  "42996": "Know you what such a moment holds for me?",
  "42997": "Now, my ladies, you strike him not?",
  "42998": "Is that the idea?",
  "42999": "Will that be necessary?",
  "43000": "You're proud of them?",
  "43001": "Why should an exception be made in her favor?",
  "43002": "Gone where?",
  "43003": "What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman?",
  "43004": "Did ever any one see such a fine piece of beef so completely ruined?",
  "43005": "Yea, is it so bad as that?",
  "43006": "Who does me this?",
  "43007": "And people think it so?",
  "43008": "What have I done that you should pass on me so severe a sentence?",
  "43009": "Did the gentleman give a name?",
  "43010": "Were they then so soon to lose him whom they had snatched from an agonizing death?",
  "43011": "And what shall you do?",
  "43012": "But why so?",
  "43013": "He was disposed to interfere too much, was he?",
  "43014": "Hot and moist?",
  "43015": "Any guerrillas?",
  "43016": "Is he goodly enough?",
  "43017": "And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?",
  "43018": "He is a rebel, then?",
  "43019": "Did you ever meet with anything like that man out of this blessed country?",
  "43020": "What were we who had strayed in here?",
  "43021": "Have I not sworn to you that I loved you in return?",
  "43022": "How have you passed the time?",
  "43023": "Had it struck on a submerged rock, or on an enormous wreck?",
  "43024": "But what if it all had been lost?",
  "43025": "Why had that man taken to flight on the arrival of the police, instead of entering a complaint?",
  "43026": "But the light?",
  "43027": "And what happens?",
  "43028": "Kindly?",
  "43029": "But what step would you propose to me?",
  "43030": "Why should you want to spite her?",
  "43031": "Can men refuse to be pleased with words of gentle advice?",

  "43034": "Do you think he can last till morning?",
  "43035": "What, if I am steeped in poverty?",
  "43036": "An advice?",
  "43037": "No one?",
  "43038": "Is it in this mode that the spirit of mutual support and common effort for the common good, is to be cultivated?",
  "43039": "You will not do that?",
  "43040": "Did you say?",
  "43041": "Oh, what are you doing?",
  "43042": "Where is the corpse lying?",
  "43043": "Is not this so?",
  "43044": "How many of their friends must have fallen in the struggle?",
  "43045": "Do you see this woman sitting beside me?",
  "43046": "And when you see the same evils in the tyrannical man, what do you say of him?",
  "43047": "Are, however, pleasures and pains strictly commensurable?",
  "43048": "Do you hear me?",
  "43049": "My dear fellow, are you really on such good terms with her as to venture to take me to her box?",
  "43050": "How may I aid in the adventure?",

  "43062": "And that human virtue is justice?",
  "43063": "Who is on duty?",
  "43064": "Did not I say so?",
  "43065": "Do fine work?",
  "43066": "But why did we teach you that?",
  "43067": "Why did they do it?",
  "43068": "Anybody been beating 'ee?",

  "43074": "How many bedrooms?",
  "43075": "Well, you see the hills beyond?",
  "43076": "And can it be my fault, can I have done anything wrong?",
  "43077": "And what if we came too late?",
  "43078": "You have turned full steam on?",
  "43079": "Have you heard?",
  "43080": "What interest, let me ask, have the people in the settlement of this question?",
  "43081": "And how should I, having been a hunter all my life?",
  "43082": "Why, what's the matter with you?",
  "43083": "And why, if you knew me, do you let me die?",
  "43084": "But what is to be done?",
  "43085": "You do not doubt that, I hope?",
  "43086": "Is it interesting?",
  "43087": "Eureka?",
  "43088": "What do they call it, that which maketh them proud?",
  "43089": "Why do you think so?",
  "43090": "What is it, dear one?",
  "43091": "Could I retract my word, and take upon myself the responsibility of compromising the future of my companions?",
  "43092": "And is it any better as it is?",
  "43093": "Answer, what?",
  "43094": "But is there no danger from the bite?",
  "43095": "How could I remember you?",
  "43096": "But do you understand me?",
  "43097": "What are we going to do, i'faith?",
  "43098": "Shall I obtain permission not to do so till I have spoken to the king, sire?",
  "43099": "Linon, have you?",
  "43100": "Would you yield to the thirst for gold?",
  "43101": "At what hour did he leave your hotel?",
  "43102": "Yet, if they ask me why I am not dancing, what am I to say?",
  "43103": "Why should you mind what they call it?",
  "43104": "Because I envy you, eh?",
  "43105": "Are you as bad as that?",
  "43106": "Do you think you would?",
  "43107": "Who is there who is not fifty years old?",
  "43108": "Did you come for your interest?",

  "43111": "Is it what you call a breakfast cap?",
  "43112": "How's that?",
  "43113": "Is the torrent in spate?",
  "43114": "May I have not my word taken?",
  "43115": "No, where?",
  "43116": "Is it so necessary that I should stop to think of manners and customs?",
  "43117": "And how is the error to be corrected?",
  "43118": "And what did she do?",
  "43119": "Then, are your names, gentlemen?",
  "43120": "Sleepy?",
  "43121": "Can it, gentlemen?",
  "43122": "Why does it make you angry when you are looked at?",
  "43123": "What do you mean by your insinuations, anyhow?",
  "43124": "You've been dull, I expect?",
  "43125": "But I wonder if she would care to?",
  "43126": "And should you mind that?",

  "44826": "Why spoil the pleasure of our friends by inflicting on them fashionable toilettes on this day of vigorous exercise in the country?",
  "44827": "Why are you the officer in charge now?",
  "44828": "You like music too?",
  "44829": "ARE we safe?",
  "44830": "Your own little share?",
  "44831": "Would it suit you to see them in the darkness of the night?",
  "44832": "Or doth it sit behind a big stone and catch flies?",
  "44833": "And then will he slay me?",
  "44834": "Regarding that as done, is there nothing I can do for you yourself?",
  "44835": "If he wished to injure it why could he not do it there?",
  "44836": "And it turned out that it was not at all because of you he was taken up?",
  "44837": "What has to be done?",
  "44838": "Why, pray, did you not tell me this, then, but excited with hopes a rustic and aged man?",
  "44839": "Is she HERE?",
  "44840": "The cowardliest?",
  "44841": "Would the doctor assist him in preventing this marriage?",
  "44842": "Is there?",
  "44843": "Yes, but are you good enough for it?",
  "44844": "To seek me?",
  "44845": "It is not he, is it?",
  "44846": "What is life?",
  "44847": "The very course he swung to this day noon?",
  "44848": "Now, what is the difference between such actions, when performed by an uncultivated man, and by one of the higher animals?",
  "44849": "And had I not been miserable with less dishonor, if I had met with a more severe and inhuman enemy?",
  "44850": "Have they fed him?",
  "44851": "But who knows whether then you will still wish to elevate him whom you now love, to be your husband?",
  "44852": "Is there no other road?",
  "44853": "Do you mean a whopper?",
  "44854": "Easy you think, eh?",
  "44855": "And your present happiness, has it softened your heart?",
  "44856": "How dare you think of staying here one moment, and refuse my wife the honours that belong to her as such?",
  "44857": "Anyone else?",
  "44858": "And why did I rush off to him just now like a lunatic, and drag him back here?",
  "44859": "Of spiritual profit?",
  "44860": "What is this bird?",
  "44861": "A professor?",
  "44862": "How are we to know whither chance will carry us?",
  "44863": "Are you stopping here?",
  "44864": "Or which must end me, a fool's wrath or love?",
  "44865": "Now, has she deserved this punishment?",
  "44866": "And may I not paint one like it for you?",
  "44867": "Why?",
  "44868": "What's the use of a lot of capital lying dead?",
  "44869": "What on earth will they expect me to talk about?",
  "44870": "Are you strong enough to stand?",
  "44871": "So I may give him your word of honour, may I, that in case of extremity you will stand by her?",
  "44872": "Would that do?",
  "44873": "You fear to see my naked blade?",
  "44874": "My idea?",
  "44875": "Why is she unhappy, I wonder?",
  "44876": "May I use it?",
  "44877": "Have I ever seen one?",
  "44878": "Months?",
  "44879": "You have abandoned the king?",
  "44880": "Where were you when you began to feel bad?",
  "44881": "Who let you loose?",
  "44882": "Is any one the less ill because one does not know the name of one's malady?",
  "44883": "I ridiculous?",
  "44884": "Are you armed?",
  "44885": "But may there not be a more or less vague and evanescent sense of tension, and some psychic fact which may be regarded as the shadowy forerunner of the consciousness of the release of tension which, on a higher plane, reveals itself as the consciousness of will?",
  "44886": "Do you know me, madame?",
  "44887": "Crack my son over the head, will you, you hardhearted, murtherin' divil?",
  "44888": "By what wickedness cometh this child here?",
  "44889": "Was he feeling badly?",
  "44890": "Is not this the most profound ignorance of human nature?",
  "44891": "Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?",
  "44892": "Do you think I should remember all about my mother's death if I were out of my mind?",
  "44893": "Do you forget that?",
  "44894": "And if each proprietor is sovereign lord within the sphere of his property, absolute king throughout his own domain, how could a government of proprietors be any thing but chaos and confusion?",
  "44895": "Was it very edifying and instructive?",
  "44896": "Must this last formality take place in your presence, sir?",
  "44897": "Do you attend the family?",
  "44898": "Who knows, when I shall be at liberty, that I may not satisfy your curiosity?",
  "44899": "Was it the devil who rang it?",
  "44900": "Is it unfaithfulness to my husband?",
  "44901": "The train is at three?",
  "44902": "Did you ever see me carry dishes?",
  "44903": "How is such a man to be worked on?",
  "44904": "What murderous spectacle is this?",
  "44905": "What do you suggest?",
  "44906": "Have you nothing to show your cousin anywhere about, not even a rabbit or a weasel's nest?",
  "44907": "Have you ever heard of him?",
  "44908": "Had he not corn enough?",
  "44909": "What weapons shall you select?",
  "44910": "Mamma, how can you go back in that way?",
  "44911": "Then no misfortune has happened to you?",
  "44912": "Is the island inhabited then?",
  "44913": "Who's that curtseying there?",
  "44914": "What happens?",
  "44915": "You have plenty of vermin to deal with, I suppose?",
  "44916": "What have you got to say, sir?",
  "44917": "You have news for me?",
  "44918": "Do you know anything?",
  "44919": "Are we not arriving too late?",
  "44920": "Is he not?",
  "44921": "Outside?",
  "44922": "Can it be possible we could be like husband and wife, alone, your family with you?",
  "44923": "What is the matter with him?",
  "44924": "Dare I look at her?",
  "44925": "And what are you going to do?",
  "44926": "What does she want now?",
  "44927": "You will not desert him?",
  "44928": "Do you make money or do you not make it?",
  "44929": "I had seen the man robbed, what else could I have done?",
  "44930": "You're not sending the horses off yet?",
  "44931": "What atones?",
  "44932": "My daughter, my daughter, why did you die?",
  "44933": "What shall we do exactly?",
  "44934": "But what has become of them all?",
  "44935": "But what was it, my love?",
  "44936": "Why does she say that?",
  "44937": "What do you advise me to do?",
  "44938": "And therefore to acknowledge that bad and good are the same?",
  "44939": "Shall I tell him to wait?",
  "44940": "What do we find?",
  "44941": "Is that right?",
  "44942": "Well, my dear, and how are we getting on?",
  "44943": "How many men have you here?",
  "44944": "What are you going as?",
  "44945": "You mean if there's a weak place?",
  "44946": "WHAT OUGHT I TO DO?",
  "44947": "Does he know I am his mother really?",
  "44948": "May I make a compact with you?",
  "44949": "Who and what are the two men of whom you speak?",
  "44950": "What are you saying, doctor?",
  "44951": "Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I WAS uncivil?",
  "44952": "What's this?",
  "44953": "Did you find him?",
  "44954": "Where is he?",
  "44955": "And since when have you become afraid of a quarrel?",
  "44956": "Where are they taking you to, you poor dear?",
  "44957": "Why, how wet it is?",
  "44958": "Suppose he finds out, and your brother, and your betrothed?",
  "44959": "Did he give any explanation of his conduct?",
  "44960": "Corcoran?",
  "44961": "How ever did you get along in a sledge?",
  "44962": "Ah, indeed?",
  "44963": "Does it exist?",
  "44964": "How many?",
  "44965": "In what manner?",
  "44966": "Will it drive me out of my mind?",
  "44967": "Would she, aunt?",
  "44968": "Pretty?",
  "44969": "Well, have you seen him?",
  "44970": "Is this one also a complementary colour?",
  "44971": "Farebrother?",
  "44972": "I wonder who he was?",
  "44973": "And when can I see this young lady, for whom I already feel so great a sympathy?",
  "44974": "Let him profit by the means as I found out?",
  "44975": "What's that about six pound a year?",
  "44976": "What is it, then, sire?",
  "44977": "You are quite sure that you do not want to sell your land?",
  "44978": "How are delights and miseries to be weighed, and reasonably balanced?",
  "44979": "In exchange for that you refuse me?",
  "44980": "Are you going to tell me that it is impossible?",
  "44981": "May I look?",
  "44982": "And what did you learn from him?",
  "44983": "How was the play?",
  "44984": "But does it shut equally well?",
  "44985": "What's yo' name?",
  "44986": "How near do you get to it?",
  "44987": "And who is the magistrate who has reason to complain of the agent?",
  "44988": "Who are you talking of?",
  "44989": "I wonder if I shall ever be happy enough to have real lace on my clothes and bows on my caps?",
  "44990": "Did you think he was too good to go?",
  "44991": "Come, now?",
  "44992": "Marry whom?",
  "44993": "Was it not unhealthful?",
  "44994": "What happened during the night?",
  "44995": "If two and two made four when we were happy together, surely they make four now?",
  "44996": "How near to you?",
  "44997": "Has the queen any further commands for me now?",
  "44998": "May it not frighten her terribly?",
  "44999": "Are the oysters good?",
  "45000": "Which colour strikes most?",
  "45001": "When the devil would you have a man be afraid but when there is so much cause?",
  "45002": "But what happened ?",
  "45003": "But how came that first note to be inserted in your journal?",
  "45004": "Then addressing herself to me, asked, with ineffable complacency, if I was the person who had been so cruelly used by robbers?",
  "45005": "But why could he not tell you this?",
  "45006": "Unseen then?",
  "45007": "Will you give me an egg to eat?",
  "45008": "Would she ever live to see it?",
  "45009": "A cart?",
  "45010": "Will you sell your rapier?",
  "45011": "What is the reader's conceived opinion of the duties and labors of a missionary in a heathen land?",
  "45012": "But if his daily death was the theme of the legend, why was it celebrated by an annual ceremony?",
  "45013": "Old fellow, can you let me have thirty pounds?",
  "45014": "How do you manage to get people to talk about it?",
  "45015": "Did not you see me tip you the wink to leave off in time?",
  "45016": "A shilling a leg?",
  "45017": "Rid myself of that nightmare?",
  "45018": "Could there possibly have been a more exact guide?",
  "45019": "Why, do you think I should be any happier if I were to feel disturbed about the excavations you tell me of?",
  "45020": "But how am I to climb?",
  "45021": "What is your love to mine?",
  "45022": "Love covers a multitude of sins, and of whom could you ask more freely than of him?",
  "45023": "And who is she, this woman that you want to see?",
  "45024": "Still, are they going to do it shortly?",
  "45025": "And of what other trees?",
  "45026": "May we not conjecture that they belonged to the people who resided in the town, and who were victorious in the engagement?",
  "45027": "Could a man be born to a more perfect glory?",
  "45028": "You are vexed?",
  "45029": "You'll not say anything about it at home, will you?",
  "45030": "To our journey's end?",
  "45031": "To what unexpected good fortune, to what accident, am I to ascribe this happy meeting?",
  "45032": "How did it fare with the missions in these days of woe and terror?",
  "45033": "And how is everybody?",
  "45034": "Perhaps you'd like to spend a couple of shillings or so, in a bottle of currant wine by and by, up in the bedroom?",
  "45035": "With what object?",
  "45036": "Or is it the matter?",
  "45037": "Do you wish a step, or some place in the government?",
  "45038": "Would it not be better to rest now?",
  "45039": "But what then?",
  "45040": "Am I right or not?",
  "45041": "Why impossible?",
  "45042": "It is agreed, then, that I carry you off with me?",
  "45043": "Quite seriously?",
  "45044": "Who should prevent you?",
  "45045": "The vastness of this word?",
  "45046": "Whose horse is waiting at your gate?",
  "45047": "Why did you light the thirsty lamp?",
  "45048": "Would he be in time to rescue?",
  "45049": "How did he come to be there?",
  "45050": "The meeting?",
  "45051": "Why do you look first on one side and then on the other, as if you were afraid of being arrested yourself, you whose business it is to arrest others?",
  "45052": "Will your majesty deign to excuse me?",
  "45053": "Shall we say it is because we have won an empire?",
  "45054": "What do you talk about?",
  "45055": "How can his readers take on trust his statements concerning the births, marriages, divorces, and deaths of a crowd of people, whose names are scarcely known to this generation?",
  "45056": "Or why should not all the three walk abreast?",
  "45057": "And is it so, maidy?",
  "45058": "Were they hungry?",
  "45059": "Do your ears tell you that they have traced our retreat?",
  "45060": "What made you sit in such an awkward position?",
  "45061": "Is not this the way in which the large landed proprietors have gradually raised their rents, as fast as they have ascertained by the increase in population and the development of industry how much society can produce from their property?",
  "45062": "Why are you so very shy, and so very sombre?",
  "45063": "What other initiative, what greater authority, do you ask?",
  "45064": "Why do you serve in this capacity?",
  "45065": "How do you like it?",
  "45066": "What month?",
  "45067": "More than in other years?",
  "45068": "But could he be sure that this was all that was to be said about this enigma, and that he should never arrive at a solution?",
  "45069": "Half a mile, you say?",
  "45070": "Has anything happened, ma'am?",
  "45071": "Where is the man who brought the letter?",
  "45072": "Whither am I going?",
  "45073": "Shall I have it, or shall I not?",
  "45074": "And all my limbs unbroken?",
  "45075": "Why did they?",
  "45076": "Do you know where we could get one?",
  "45077": "Well, and you want your fortune told?",
  "45078": "Was it his wife, or else as like her as any sister could be?",
  "45079": "Does that mean that all men have a right to all property?",
  "45080": "And can bear to have my morsel of bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my cup?",
  "45081": "One thing and another commit?",
  "45082": "Can you tell me, this last time, that you feel quite, quite sure, no new affections of mine, and no new duties of mine, will ever interpose between us?",
  "45083": "You remember all this quite clearly, but how is it that your reason calmly accepted all the manifest absurdities and impossibilities that crowded into your dream?",
  "45084": "What troops are these that seem to be passing through the wood?",
  "45085": "You'd never think it to look at me, would you?",
  "45086": "What shall I sing?",
  "45087": "Is there no gentleman or lady of virtue in this neighbourhood, to whom I may fly, only till l can find a way to get to my poor father and mother?",
  "45088": "What object could they have?",
  "45089": "And do you suppose she understands nothing?",
  "45090": "Could I have caused that girl's death and procreated this being?",
  "45091": "What do the women find so impressive in that little brat?",
  "45092": "Well, sir?",
  "45093": "And I must cross it with silver, I suppose?",
  "45094": "A letter?",
  "45095": "Whom follow?",
  "45096": "What means this profession of faith?",
  "45097": "Again, if the uncooling or warm principle were imperishable, the fire when assailed by cold would not have perished or have been extinguished, but would have gone away unaffected?",
  "45098": "His wife?",
  "45099": "What place is that?",
  "45100": "Is not this thing which you advise me to do a little cowardly?",
  "45101": "Who has paid adulation to the nation while claiming for it a sovereignty which it was incapable of exercising?",
  "45102": "Have you not wished to go?",
  "45103": "Died he of sickness or through treachery?",
  "45104": "To how much?",
  "45105": "Why, why are people all balls of bitter dust?",
  "45106": "You tell me nothing?",
  "45107": "What means this?",
  "45108": "Who calls?",
  "45109": "Why should I deny it?",
  "45110": "What is the matter with them?",
  "45111": "Is it not inconceivable, that a tribune should have power to imprison a consul, and the people have no authority to degrade him when he uses that honor which he received from them, to their detriment?",
  "45112": "Now, children, which is it to be?",
  "45113": "Is the doctrine warranted by FACTS?",
  "45114": "Then what will you do with me then?",
  "45115": "Can anyone grasp what such an offer meant at such a spot, made to a man who, to tell the truth, is very fond of a smoke after meals?",
  "45116": "From whom had they that information?",
  "45117": "Shall I ever see your sister?",
  "45118": "Then your duchess is still at the waters?",
  "45119": "Have you heard anything of the case?",
  "45120": "Do you wish to try to do so?",
  "45121": "After all, he said in his bitterness, what can a woman care about so much as house and furniture?",
  "45122": "What was his devotion worth to her?",
  "45123": "I suppose I could walk with the rest?",
  "45124": "But why waste more words on them?",
  "45125": "What was it fell last night from the evil moon?",
  "45126": "Just as she was, in a manner, pretending to listen?",
  "45127": "Two words?",
  "45128": "It was he who told you to invite me to appear with these studs?",
  "45129": "And how were they treated?",
  "45130": "Do you bring me a message from the king, or have you made a bold hit, and wish me to take you again under my protection?",
  "45131": "How many times have we seen it?",
  "45132": "Well, then, what possessed you to go down there this time of night?",
  "45133": "And do you know who is his lieutenant?",
  "45134": "I suppose that's what your humanity would suggest?",
  "45135": "And are you going away, then, really?",
  "45136": "Do you not know that you have been dead this long time?",
  "45137": "How long a delay do you wish for?",
  "45138": "Well, what will you give for it?",
  "45139": "What evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of your senses?",
  "45140": "But should you not interfere?",
  "45141": "Mademoiselle, how could you believe that?",
  "45142": "Do you understand what the word pity means?",
  "45143": "You mean it makes you feel that you have nothing?",
  "45144": "But what about women?",
  "45145": "Besides, how could one land on the opposite bank among willows which would scuttle the boat, and with a flood of unknown extent?",
  "45146": "Have I, indeed, said anything you should answer with such a cruel remark?",
  "45147": "What hinders it?",
  "45148": "So what have you done with it?",
  "45149": "You mean when a woman has children?",
  "45150": "What is there to surprise anyone in that?",
  "45151": "If I only had it here, wretch that I am, what more should we want?",
  "45152": "Well, monseigneur?",
  "45153": "Do you wish me to begin admiring the peoples?",
  "45154": "Do I not myself know that I am at this moment in want of a dozen pages, and that I am sick with cudgelling my brains to find them?",
  "45155": "Did you observe any one during the first act?",
  "45156": "Have you heard the news?",
  "45157": "And what IS this on my head?",
  "45158": "Why deceive us further?",
  "45159": "And by whom are you forbidden?",
  "45160": "Who has done this?",
  "45161": "And who was that man?",
  "45162": "What happened to you?",
  "45163": "What put her up to clearing out?",
  "45164": "Well, sire?",
  "45165": "Any answer?",
  "45166": "How do you do?",
  "45167": "And so, is it quite certain he is coming?",
  "45168": "If nobody were rich, who would employ the poor?",
  "45169": "And what do you expect the king to reply?",
  "45170": "But if she does?",
  "45171": "Where is he who could say it no?",
  "45172": "I have surely not been dreaming, have I?",
  "45173": "Shall we light a fire, so as to signal our presence on the coast?",
  "45174": "Do you think of dying, my lord?",
  "45175": "What does the poetry or the value of the ring signify?",
  "45176": "What do you believe, what do you KNOW?",
  "45177": "How's my poor brother?",
  "45178": "Is he so hard, then?",
  "45179": "Why did you come?",
  "45180": "Oh, mother, what is the matter?",
  "45181": "And what house is this?",
  "45182": "What, no second club?",
  "45183": "Will fish go down with them?",
  "45184": "May it not, theoretically, include as much of the universe as is known to man?",
  "45185": "Is it my affair?",
  "45186": "I, madame?",
  "45187": "Why should you go about the parish?",
  "45188": "Who is this ancient teacher or who is his prototype if he is an ideal being?",
  "45189": "What could those words mean?",
  "45190": "Did you never do any robbery in your life?",
  "45191": "What devil?",
  "45192": "Why are we less prompt to provide for our own safety than the rest of the citizens?",
  "45193": "I said, do you hear me?",
  "45194": "For what purpose?",
  "45195": "Is his hour past?",
  "45196": "Do you know of any other?",
  "45197": "For how, under different wills, should we find complete unity of ends?",
  "45198": "Did you ever see anything to equal it, as you steam away in the sunset?",
  "45199": "Were you thinking of your birth then?",
  "45200": "Look at a plant in the midst of its range, why does it not double or quadruple its numbers?",
  "45201": "Am I too heavy?",
  "45202": "Shall we agree to this plan, or not?",
  "45203": "Buy back your wheelbarrow?",
  "45204": "Do they begin by exciting the detestation of the very instruments of their intended usurpations?",
  "45205": "But, surely, if he were convinced that it was absolutely necessary for the vindication of his innocence, he would submit to charge himself with an expense so necessary, not only for himself, but for his family?",
  "45206": "Up so early?",
  "45207": "Do I know you?",
  "45208": "His things and his bag are with him?",
  "45209": "Another shock, eh?",
  "45210": "Can I trust you?",
  "45211": "Other people's?",

  "45213": "And fought?",
  "45214": "Was there no other who contributed?",
  "45215": "Under what obligation do I lie of making such an abuse of time?",
  "45216": "Could any other man express what they knew so well how to express in tones and in words?",
  "45217": "But what book is that next it?",
  "45218": "It surely cannot be you who made shoes for me at the l'ecole militaire?",
  "45219": "How must I do?",
  "45220": "But how, sir, said I, did you part?",
  "45221": "Where was the first lion?",
  "45222": "What is its name?",
  "45223": "That is, you mean that sin keeps him back?",
  "45224": "To whom was this letter addressed?",
  "45225": "Carlo, did I offer any violence?",
  "45226": "But if there be anything which is of such a nature as to be and not to be, that will have a place intermediate between pure being and the absolute negation of being?",
  "45227": "Who are your uncles and aunts?",
  "45228": "What was he saying yesterday?",
  "45229": "If much comfort cannot be expected from the friendship of a reformed rake of superior abilities, what is the consequence when he lacketh sense, as well as principles?",
  "45230": "And do you think I ever shall?",
  "45231": "Why do you want me?",
  "45232": "I ask you what year is it?",
  "45233": "What sent you hither?",
  "45234": "Was such a thing ever heard of?",
  "45235": "What had she to do with the justice or injustice of other people?",
  "45236": "Which is it to be, death or life?",
  "45237": "How will they proceed?",
  "45238": "Not a cloud?",
  "45239": "What has that boy been about?",
  "45240": "Or any other time?",
  "45241": "Are they not already in the land?",
  "45242": "What did they want there?",
  "45243": "To which?",
  "45244": "The surface of a sphere?",
  "45245": "Are they happy?",
  "45246": "Is it a good road, and how far?",
  "45247": "And the lord chamberlain?",
  "45248": "Mayor?",
  "45249": "Had you ever any reason to complain of him?",
  "45250": "Will you promise me then to be at peace?",
  "45251": "A voyage?",
  "45252": "And they found the child?",
  "45253": "Yet what will the energy of true genius not effect?",
  "45254": "What is there to hinder?",
  "45255": "Is it a lonely farm?",
  "45256": "And can I play with him, too?",
  "45257": "Why do I want to go?",
  "45258": "What business, said she, had you to read my letter?",
  "45259": "Or, if it ought to give any, what are the different parts of education which it ought to attend to in the different orders of the people?",
  "45260": "What time did he set off for town?",
  "45261": "And are you coming with us?",
  "45262": "When had that question been settled?",
  "45263": "Had he travelled?",
  "45264": "And why have you such an air of sadness aboard?",
  "45265": "And what has become of the business?",
  "45266": "Was it an instant of enchantment only or long hours and years and ages?",
  "45267": "Is the lady so very alarming?",
  "45268": "And how is it possible to help losing a stronghold that is not relieved, above all when surrounded by a host of determined enemies in their own country?",
  "45269": "Your marriage?",
  "45270": "Your aunt?",
  "45271": "By means of what organ?",
  "45272": "What DOES the face matter?",
  "45273": "All of it?",
  "45274": "Is he lost, I wonder, in this desert?",
  "45275": "Can you enlighten me on that point?",
  "45276": "What makes her want to see ye?",
  "45277": "Do you mean to ask this girl to marry you?",
  "45278": "Are you quite well?",
  "45279": "And what this?",
  "45280": "Did not his land produce sufficient of everything?",
  "45281": "When did it break out?",
  "45282": "Why add up the elements of resistance and anarchy?",
  "45283": "And pray, if you are so good, who ventures to affirm that?",
  "45284": "What for?",
  "45285": "What are you thinking of doing?",
  "45286": "How could we live and where could we live?",
  "45287": "Is it so nice as all that?",
  "45288": "But what do I say?",
  "45289": "Whom does this belong to?",
  "45290": "Who are you, my good man?",
  "45291": "Had I dreamt?",
  "45292": "Why did she so lose courage?",
  "45293": "And can you not understand why I said fortune favours us?",
  "45294": "What's the use of living?",
  "45295": "Are you well and happy?",
  "45296": "What to do?",
  "45297": "Did the sun, which shone so brightly everywhere else, really fall upon him?",
  "45298": "And if there is truth in what has preceded, he will be wedded to an image of pleasure which is thrice removed as to truth from the pleasure of the oligarch?",
  "45299": "What brings you here, dear heart?",
  "45300": "What were they now?",
  "45301": "You understand what I say?",
  "45302": "Will it be said that the opposition between man and the divine being is illusory, and that it arises from the opposition that exists between the individual man and the essence of entire humanity?",
  "45303": "Are they in safety?",
  "45304": "Sneezed, did you?",
  "45305": "I'm not?",
  "45306": "Have you forgotten that a son ought to love and honour his father and mother?",
  "45307": "Had the remembrance of her teaching utterly vanished, and the last trace of her maternal influence quite faded away?",
  "45308": "What do you want with me?",
  "45309": "You are staying the whole evening, I hope?",
  "45310": "What weight would that carry?",
  "45311": "Good gracious, what noise is that?",
  "45312": "Have you seen the princess?",
  "45313": "Is it because there is no word tender enough to be your name?",
  "45314": "So you wanted to get away, my dear, did you?",
  "45315": "Did it not show that he comprehended his relations with her?",
  "45316": "What need of positive law where natural justice is, of itself, a sufficient restraint?",
  "45317": "But how was it settled between you, mamma?",
  "45318": "What means this?",
  "45319": "What is it that is strange?",
  "45320": "Coming in to have a short time?",
  "45321": "Do you reproach me?",
  "45322": "And what do you pick your teeth with, after devouring that fat goose?",
  "45323": "Had not his books taught him that he was a man?",
  "45324": "And will you mention to me the yearly sum which would repay you for managing these affairs which we have discussed together?",
  "45325": "What'll be over?",
  "45326": "But then, what are we here for?",
  "45327": "You have?",
  "45328": "De qui?",
  "45329": "What was it, my dear?",
  "45330": "She was young, you say?",
  "45331": "His effect?",
  "45332": "What is life to you?",
  "45333": "Where are you living now?",
  "45334": "Have they?",
  "45335": "Shall my messenger, in your name, tell your people to give in?",
  "45336": "And does he still tip you?",
  "45337": "If he forsakes his faith, how doth it profit you?",
  "45338": "Why do you do such a strange thing?",
  "45339": "Why did you think so?",
  "45340": "Does he say so now?",
  "45341": "And both should be in harmony?",
  "45342": "Why, you love him, do you not?",
  "45343": "I hope I am doing nothing wrong in asking it again?",
  "45344": "Had he spoken of himself, of himself as he was or wished to be?",
  "45345": "If he did not, what would she do?",
  "45346": "And ought not the same natures to have the same pursuits?",
  "45347": "What next?",
  "45348": "Why did it happen?",
  "45349": "But our troop horses?",
  "45350": "Nay, tell me, how many histories are there filled with these marvels?",
  "45351": "Do you mind my smoking?",
  "45352": "How, then, does this passion for gain, abandoned to itself, turn to the prejudice of society?",
  "45353": "If a kiss had been imprinted?",
  "45354": "Well, do you attend the function tonight?",
  "45355": "But they have wisdom, else what is the use of having died?",
  "45356": "Always a muddle?",
  "45357": "Have I given no testimony of my sincerity and of my passion?",
  "45358": "That's everything?",
  "45359": "Is this the same lemonade of which you partook?",
  "45360": "And what does he charge?",
  "45361": "But the horses?",
  "45362": "In summer?",
  "45363": "And what the devil was the matter with his head?",
  "45364": "Why do we love?",
  "45365": "And what do the rulers call the people?",
  "45366": "And how much was the residue?",
  "45367": "What do you think he replied?",
  "45368": "Or is it equally criminal in every body?",
  "45369": "Perhaps you think I shall abandon you, dear grandpapa, and that I shall forget you when I am married?",
  "45370": "What's coming next?",
  "45371": "Suppose we had attained our end, would it not have been better to have found continents in broad daylight than a country plunged in utter darkness?",
  "45372": "Did your father speak of it?",
  "45373": "What was that noise?",
  "45374": "What made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here?",
  "45375": "An old hag who said her son had the plague?",
  "45376": "How then was it closed?",
  "45377": "But, if from their birth men and women are placed in a torrid zone, with the meridian sun of pleasure darting directly upon them, how can they sufficiently brace their minds to discharge the duties of life, or even to relish the affections that carry them out of themselves?",
  "45378": "What is the cause of all this?",
  "45379": "What do I seek on the height?",
  "45380": "Have the enemy called in any foreign help?",
  "45381": "Lost her memory, eh?",
  "45382": "And pray who are the persons who exhaust your fortune?",
  "45383": "You did not recognise me?",
  "45384": "How shall I break through them?",
  "45385": "That your own bunk over on that side?",
  "45386": "Is this a fact?",
  "45387": "But where, where was this self, this innermost part, this ultimate part?",
  "45388": "What have I to consider?",
  "45389": "Had she succeeded in extracting the secret, and awakening in that adamant heart a last faint touch of pity?",
  "45390": "And will you transfer me to your brother?",
  "45391": "Indeed formerly you were wont to give us some freely, and will you not now let us have any for our money?",
  "45392": "How did it come about, I wonder, that the elder officers are not here to interfere with anything you do?",
  "45393": "Natasha, what is it about?",
  "45394": "I may turn my back on this town a few hours sooner than I intended, but what of that?",
  "45395": "How are they?",
  "45396": "Divide it by three, and what is the result?",
  "45397": "Would I speak to you if he did?",
  "45398": "Where shall I go to find you?",
  "45399": "And the casks?",
  "45400": "Said I, is there here a new world?",
  "45401": "Hamlet's which?",
  "45402": "And suppose some learned traveller should come across these specimens, eh?",
  "45403": "Dare you pretend to rouse him against me?",
  "45404": "Is it possible that you consider the sea to be greater now than formerly?",
  "45405": "Where are your reindeer?",
  "45406": "Why was it I wanted to tell him and did not tell him?",
  "45407": "Have I not a wife?",
  "45408": "What time are you supposed to return?",
  "45409": "Why, what are these doing, who are bent down so much?",
  "45410": "Five pounds?",
  "45411": "But why do you wish to bind yourself?",
  "45412": "Say, is it possible?",
  "45413": "You've bought our inn?",
  "45414": "If he were not only to sink from his highest resolve, but to sink into the hideous fettering of domestic hate?",
  "45415": "Must one not surrender his right when he is unable to recover it?",
  "45416": "Why are you so careful, so tender, of this one wrong and no other?",
  "45417": "How am I to pay them?",
  "45418": "You hear that?",
  "45419": "I hope you will not object to my remaining at home, sir?",
  "45420": "And you have brought him back here?",
  "45421": "Should he speak to her?",
  "45422": "And the first?",
  "45423": "How can one describe a man?",
  "45424": "Do you know what you look like, all together, as you are armed and guarded by your lackeys?",
  "45425": "Besides, if women are educated for dependence, that is, to act according to the will of another fallible being, and submit, right or wrong, to power, where are we to stop?",
  "45426": "Do you believe him to be implicated?",
  "45427": "Now, what are you waiting for?",
  "45428": "Have you got the pipe?",
  "45429": "Is it surprising, that such a tasteless being should rather caress this dog than her children?",
  "45430": "Of how many does it consist?",
  "45431": "How could they learn, how calculate, in the midst of this night?",
  "45432": "What satisfaction could a woman of delicacy promise herself in a union with such a man, when the very artlessness of her affection might appear insipid?",
  "45433": "Are not the two sexes made for one another?",
  "45434": "Are these bears here?",
  "45435": "No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of mine?",
  "45436": "When will he come?",
  "45437": "What misfortune has happened then?",
  "45438": "Were they TO BE or BORN TO BE?",
  "45439": "And how far from the edge of the wood?",
  "45440": "When you get through working your horses this fall, will you turn them out in the snow?",
  "45441": "If it's all wrong, why does he read them?",
  "45442": "This famous invention of yours?",
  "45443": "But what are you shouting for?",
  "45444": "Or what is your name?",
  "45445": "Do you mind him only having two noises?",
  "45446": "Was that poetry?",
  "45447": "Have we done?",
  "45448": "Why take less critical utilitarians as the only exponents of the school?",
  "45449": "And where do you find them?",
  "45450": "Should he, on the very threshold of such an errand, be afraid?",
  "45451": "Are you married, or are you not?",
  "45452": "The lamps are right, are they?",
  "45453": "For what purpose is your question?",
  "45454": "No luck for old fellows, then, my sweet bud of the wilderness?",
  "45455": "Did the other boys do so?",
  "45456": "Is it possible to transmit a projectile up to the moon?",
  "45457": "Would you like my carbine?",
  "45458": "So you do remember some things?",
  "45459": "Off I go where?",
  "45460": "And would not my four months' silence appear to him a tacit acceptance of our situation?",
  "45461": "Pray is your lodger within?",
  "45462": "What is easier, you know?",
  "45463": "What, you must leave?",
  "45464": "But how can I?",
  "45465": "What is it you want, dear grandpapa?",
  "45466": "Shall the air never again be lighted with the glare of our guns?",
  "45467": "Had this sphinx his fore paws in crime and his hind paws in authority?",
  "45468": "Are you satisfied, you great fool?",
  "45469": "Was he sure of his man?",
  "45470": "Where is the villain?",
  "45471": "You have already sworn the oath of secrecy and fidelity, and you are aware that the punishment for any breach of it is instant and inevitable death?",
  "45472": "Now what is this?",
  "45473": "Did they try to fight you when you saw 'em?",
  "45474": "Your excellency, how come you to be here?",
  "45475": "Well, then, a horse?",
  "45476": "As valiant as was that other?",
  "45477": "Alas, but that sentence is a puddle, is it not?",
  "45478": "I really, my dear, described to you a manner?",
  "45479": "You pelief, ten, in te possibilty of te odd ?",
  "45480": "Why is man, who was born for society, not yet associated?",
  "45481": "Yet in what respect can she be termed good?",
  "45482": "If it makes you invis'ble, why do you eat it?",
  "45483": "When do you wish me to go and find your father?",
  "45484": "And what news hear you?",
  "45485": "Might I see you sew it up?",
  "45486": "Is he a deputy?",
  "45487": "Do say something more?",
  "45488": "You're not afraid of the snow melting first?",
  "45489": "But how?",
  "45490": "Is it very late, mother?",
  "45491": "How are ye, lads?",
  "45492": "What next, I mean?",
  "45493": "And now, what must we do?",
  "45494": "Will this closet suit you, my brother?",
  "45495": "How could I answer?",
  "45496": "What of that?",
  "45497": "Is there any particular and special reason for your being unable to do either?",
  "45498": "Why will not the marechal advance me a portion of my patrimony?",
  "45499": "What were you crying for?",
  "45500": "Will you mount?",
  "45501": "Did you never observe, I said, the effect on the mind itself of exclusive devotion to gymnastic, or the opposite effect of an exclusive devotion to music?",
  "45502": "Still attracts a little, eh?",
  "45503": "Did his spirit sink as he approached his dreary home, oppressed with a dark foreboding of what the future should bring forth?",
  "45504": "So you DID get here, after all?",
  "45505": "Early?",
  "45506": "What is it that really happens?",
  "45507": "Equally?",
  "45508": "And now, how can I retrace the impression left upon me by that walk under the waters?",
  "45509": "How can she know how much we think of our darling?",
  "45510": "There was an advertisement of yours in the papers this morning?",
  "45511": "A being?",
  "45512": "Will you not come and choose your own beasts tomorrow?",
  "45513": "What can I say on the matter?",
  "45514": "And how was she to divide the guests between the marquee and the parlour?",
  "45515": "Did you get my note?",
  "45516": "Well, then, what can be done?",
  "45517": "Sell them?",
  "45518": "Well, is the plaid dry?",
  "45519": "Will you not follow 'em?",
  "45520": "What wonder was it that this spot exercised a strong attraction upon each of us at the moment when we were to turn our backs upon it for good?",
  "45521": "Are all voters true to their high responsibilities?",
  "45522": "What can that matter to him?",
  "45523": "What do you think of her?",
  "45524": "Did she also see slowly, but surely, increasing traces of those long wrinkles on the forehead, those slender serpents that nothing can check?",
  "45525": "But how can I wear ornaments if you, who are the elder sister, will never wear them?",
  "45526": "But what matters that?",
  "45527": "What kind of country should we have to deal with?",
  "45528": "Had the word lost its power, or could the failing eye and weary sense no longer answer to the touch of that mighty inspiration?",
  "45529": "At their age?",
  "45530": "What would therefore be more open to him than to keep her in love with him?",
  "45531": "Not to your ladyship's knowledge, perhaps?",
  "45532": "I hope you are not angry with him?",
  "45533": "Why do you look at the thing, then?",
  "45534": "McNabbs?",
  "45535": "Do you wish me to lend you some?",
  "45536": "Can you use your sails?",
  "45537": "Towards what?",
  "45538": "Could I say a few words with you in the next box?",
  "45539": "But what shall you do with him?",
  "45540": "But can there be any difficulty in proving, that vice and virtue are not matters of fact, whose existence we can infer by reason?",
  "45541": "Since a puff of tobacco can cloud it, shall I follow the fitful fire?",
  "45542": "When was that first hateful moment in which she had been conscious of a feeling that clashed with her truth, affection, and gratitude, and had not shaken it from her with horror, as if it had been a loathsome thing?",
  "45543": "She will not take poison and have horrid pains, will she?",
  "45544": "Is that right?",
  "45545": "And yet you will let me perish with hunger?",
  "45546": "Why cannot I speak out?",
  "45547": "And why YOU?",
  "45548": "Are they and we no longer the same men?",
  "45549": "You feel quite at home here again, I dare say?",
  "45550": "Was I laughing?",
  "45551": "Has any thing happened?",
  "45552": "When went he?",
  "45553": "Gone already?",
  "45554": "Does she not share in the general jubilee?",
  "45555": "Which way?",
  "45556": "And did you give it to him?",
  "45557": "What became of the poor woman?",
  "45558": "How could you send me such reports as these?",
  "45559": "Miss me?",
  "45560": "Oh, ciphers is it?",
  "45561": "Had always the headache?",
  "45562": "Can any of them read?",
  "45563": "Have I the pleasure of seeing that gentleman before me?",
  "45564": "When?",
  "45565": "Why do you want water?",
  "45566": "Is she married?",
  "45567": "Is there any such foolish thing in the world, ha?",
  "45568": "Did any one of the thirteen colonies entertain such a design or expectation?",
  "45569": "Why, what has happened?",
  "45570": "What soul his future conduct can foresee?",
  "45571": "What praise shall we bestow?",
  "45572": "Well, sir, and what profession are you meant for?",
  "45573": "What man is that?",
  "45574": "You cannot seriously wish me to stay idling at home all day?",
  "45575": "Could you have believed such a thing possible?",
  "45576": "Is that the man?",
  "45577": "Do they take good care of you?",
  "45578": "What about it?",
  "45579": "Then he is here?",
  "45580": "And what do you say to all this?",
  "45581": "Where were you last night?",
  "45582": "Are all the rest of our men gone?",
  "45583": "What disturbs you?",
  "45584": "Have you given her warning for good?",
  "45585": "Truths?",
  "45586": "And did you not bring me to this cave?",
  "45587": "If you, who are the valet, hope for dispensation to commit a crime, shall not I, the friend of your bishop, have dispensation for eating meat at the call of my stomach?",
  "45588": "Would you do me the favour to look at a few specimens of my portrait painting?",
  "45589": "And what is the revolution that we shall cause?",
  "45590": "What the devil have you seen, then?",
  "45591": "Do you travel far?",
  "45592": "Why should you, for a mere passing pleasure, risk the loss of those great powers with which you have been endowed?",
  "45593": "And where are you off to now?",
  "45594": "And what is a portrait of a woman?",
  "45595": "Do you think that excuses his assaulting his passengers?",
  "45596": "How could she have while living such a rough life as this?",
  "45597": "Could I stand against the two?",

  "46957": "Admitting this to be true of desire generally, let us suppose a particular class of desires, and out of these we will select hunger and thirst, as they are termed, which are the most obvious of them?",
  "46958": "Do you believe it yourself?",
  "46959": "May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?",
  "46960": "What baby?",
  "46961": "Do you know what I should like to do to that old horror?",
  "46962": "How do we get on?",

  "47015": "Are we at the end?",
  "47016": "Well, who doubts it?",
  "47017": "When did you find it out?",
  "47018": "Who, may I ask?",

  "49131": "Did you receive my little note the day before yesterday?",
  "49132": "What sort of a report would they bring of the result?",
  "49133": "And what are you jawing for like that?",
  "49134": "What did you see?",
  "49135": "Going to see the pictures?",
  "49136": "But who should be the executioner?",
  "49137": "And what was that working?",
  "49138": "What are you going to do about him?",
  "49139": "You are not worse, are you?",
  "49140": "Why not go right down now and fix him?",
  "49141": "You may have recognized the fumes?",
  "49142": "Oh, what does that matter?",
  "49143": "From whom did you get this?",
  "49144": "Who do you reckon 't is?",
  "49145": "Why did he not break it there, since it is evident that every yard that he carried it increased the risk of someone meeting him?",
  "49146": "Which I took hold of and was merrily asking him what he would take to have it said for my honour that it was of my getting?",
  "49147": "How did it come to be cut like that?",
  "49148": "On the hypothesis of the essential goodness of man, how then is to be explained the monstrous attempt to change the authority of some into nobility and the obedience of others into plebeianism?",
  "49149": "Why do you trample upon dead bodies in this temple?",
  "49150": "And how did it happen?",
  "49151": "What do you consider to be the greatest blessing which you have reaped from your wealth?",
  "49152": "Where got she the strength to resist the impulse?",
  "49153": "Anything I like?",
  "49154": "Micawber?",
  "49155": "Are you a large party?",
  "49156": "What were our feelings at that moment?",
  "49157": "Where are you running to?",
  "49158": "A document?",
  "49159": "Do you not reckon me?",
  "49160": "MATERIALS?",
  "49161": "Will any antiquarian inform us, if possible, why these bones were placed here?",
  "49162": "And what do you call these, my darling?",
  "49163": "As to you, monseigneur?",
  "49164": "And had he any right to ask her for a revelation of feelings which she had evidently intended to withhold from him?",
  "49165": "Which of the three is it?",
  "49166": "What do I say?",
  "49167": "And you heard what he said?",
  "49168": "Will you give them to me?",
  "49169": "Well, and what have you been doing?",
  "49170": "Why are there no daffodils now?",
  "49171": "Is it not a happy feeling?",
  "49172": "Why sacrifice forty?",
  "49173": "Where's that ten cents?",
  "49174": "And if he left off dreaming about you, where do you suppose you'd be?",
  "49175": "With your brother?",
  "49176": "Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy?",
  "49177": "Now, dear, what are your own?",
  "49178": "I suffer from emotion?",
  "49179": "What laws are there for us?",
  "49180": "And shall she have the head she covets?",
  "49181": "Would she go out to work again?",
  "49182": "Where did I disappear to?",
  "49183": "And you have no way to get news of them?",
  "49184": "Again the law?",
  "49185": "Aunt, will you have some beef?",
  "49186": "Saw her?",
  "49187": "Shall we get out and try to find the road?",
  "49188": "You found something compromising?",
  "49189": "Do you see this letter?",
  "49190": "The gentleman who receives us?",
  "49191": "Has my father asked you for money?",
  "49192": "Who are you, that you should question the judgment of the nations and the ages?",
  "49193": "What would they do in that case?",
  "49194": "You have not counted me out as equal to so much land, and calculated on me as a balance at your banker's?",
  "49195": "Do you know what this plant is?",
  "49196": "Was he awake, or was it but a dream?",
  "49197": "I wonder where we can go next?",
  "49198": "Are you thinking, if I'm drunk itself, I'd leave my daughter living single with a little frisky rascal is the like of you?",
  "49199": "And what awaits you if you remain faithful to your oath, and obey the commands given you?",
  "49200": "Sire, have you in the army one regiment on which you can implicitly rely?",
  "49201": "Will it take long?",
  "49202": "What's that pump stopping for?",
  "49203": "But then, why do you repulse me?",
  "49204": "Are you willing?",
  "49205": "Have I any?",
  "49206": "I wish you'd lend me half a sovereign, will you?",
  "49207": "No, really?",
  "49208": "Has he left you for another?",
  "49209": "Can we really affect the adversary's will?",
  "49210": "Shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the sea?",
  "49211": "Would you say that these, or any similar impertinences which private individuals are supposed to address to their rulers, whether in verse or prose, are well or ill spoken?",
  "49212": "Was it possible for her to forgive him?",
  "49213": "How did late continuators, familiar with the serpents, lions, bulls' heads, crabs, doves, and so forth, on the contemporary shields, keep such picturesque and attractive details out of their new rhapsodies?",
  "49214": "D'you like all that frilly, bunchy stuff at the throat?",
  "49215": "What purpose do they serve?",
  "49216": "Oh is it?",
  "49217": "Were all those dear, sorrowful, valiant, charming or tragic beings merely dreams?",
  "49218": "Is there anything of the feminine gender among them?",
  "49219": "Lodging?",
  "49220": "Not his brother?",
  "49221": "And which of them made this passage?",
  "49222": "Not more?",
  "49223": "Has he been examined by any synod or council?",
  "49224": "Have you any objection to see him in my presence?",
  "49225": "But what about them at home?",
  "49226": "What is the difference between light and the lustre which is seen on the polished surface of opaque bodies?",
  "49227": "Now, ma'am, am I a fool?",
  "49228": "You know who that is?",
  "49229": "Had she left no friends, no relations behind her?",
  "49230": "What are you doing?",
  "49231": "You'll take me as I am, with nothing?",
  "49232": "Things are all right with you then?",
  "49233": "Ought he to turn to the left or to the right?",
  "49234": "Who dares?",
  "49235": "But how did you manage it, little pa?",
  "49236": "Some what?",
  "49237": "Do you give it to me?",
  "49238": "Tell me, are you human, or are you more than human?",
  "49239": "And you have not made her speak?",
  "49240": "Took hold of you?",
  "49241": "Have you not talked long enough to drink?",
  "49242": "How can you be so cruel to me?",
  "49243": "Are you better?",
  "49244": "Who is it that you have fallen in love with, my poor fellow?",
  "49245": "Come, come, who did you think we were when you ran away from us?",
  "49246": "But what do you require of me, then?",
  "49247": "Do you like roses?",
  "49248": "Not just yet?",
  "49249": "Was there ever a loser content with the loss of the game?",
  "49250": "Going?",
  "49251": "What's the colour of their stockings?",
  "49252": "Why do you look at us like that?",
  "49253": "Does his daughter know of the relapse?",
  "49254": "Is it not a pity that people who are bright and clever should so often be exceedingly improper?",
  "49255": "What did it all mean?",
  "49256": "Would you like a little mash?",
  "49257": "And what salary do you ask?",
  "49258": "I s'pose you'll be starting off for college in a fortnight's time?",
  "49259": "But, can they be expected to inspire independent sentiments, whose conduct must be regulated by the cautious prudence that is ever on the watch for preferment?",
  "49260": "Did you see a young lad passing this way in the early morning or the fall of night?",
  "49261": "How can you say so?",
  "49262": "And how did he treat you?",
  "49263": "You, dear mamma?",
  "49264": "What line shall you take, then?",
  "49265": "Towards a new sun?",
  "49266": "May I come in, guardian?",
  "49267": "Has he finished his turn?",
  "49268": "Mahotin?",
  "49269": "Yet why did he come?",
  "49270": "Is it as bad as all that?",
  "49271": "How old are you and what's your name?",
  "49272": "Are the others coming out?",
  "49273": "Are you certain that you can afford to part with so much money, and that it is right that it should be so expended?",
  "49274": "Was that last night?",
  "49275": "Is my pa in, do you know?",
  "49276": "Is that all?",
  "49277": "Was this ever possible?",
  "49278": "Their hair?",
  "49279": "Did they leave these two industries to themselves?",
  "49280": "Do they by attaching to the soul and inhering in her at last bring her to death, and so separate her from the body ?",
  "49281": "Have you been slightly dazzled at the sudden fusion of my ingots?",
  "49282": "Perhaps you did not like it?",
  "49283": "Did he look in this way?",
  "49284": "To me?",
  "49285": "But, look here, are you a great hand with the ladies?",
  "49286": "Have you?",
  "49287": "Was he a man or only a crosseyed thief an a loafer?",
  "49288": "Is that all the story?",
  "49289": "None of it at all?",
  "49290": "And how do you find home, now you have come back to it?",
  "49291": "Do you suppose you could find any good in a child by whipping him?",
  "49292": "Is it the secret instinct of decaying nature, or the soul's impulsive throb, as immortality draws on?",
  "49293": "Who was the youth he had adopted and who bore so striking a resemblance to him?",
  "49294": "And his offence?",
  "49295": "Are you sure you are not making a mistake?",
  "49296": "You mean your papers?",
  "49297": "It is a poor conclusion, is it not?",
  "49298": "It may also be called temperate, and for the same reasons?",
  "49299": "But surely this is somewhat irrelevant?",
  "49300": "Was it very vile to be dragged back here again?",
  "49301": "Can you break an engagement off slowly?",
  "49302": "Do you wish to ruin us outright?",
  "49303": "Any how does she do?",
  "49304": "Neckett's children?",
  "49305": "Safe?",
  "49306": "My friends, why do I wish for peace?",
  "49307": "Can he speak?",
  "49308": "And why not with you?",
  "49309": "Well, do you like it?",
  "49310": "What was she to do?",
  "49311": "But can you make any sense out of them?",
  "49312": "He was not playing, then?",
  "49313": "Rosamond a sufferer, a labourer, a female apostle?",
  "49314": "Who could grant them?",
  "49315": "What were you saying about being married?",
  "49316": "Was he engaged in a struggle with some animal whose retreat he had disturbed?",
  "49317": "Did he sign, too?",
  "49318": "You're not angry with me any more?",
  "49319": "How long will this fuse burn?",
  "49320": "Why do you hesitate?",
  "49321": "How can I ever describe the charm and picturesqueness of that summer life?",
  "49322": "May I write to you?",
  "49323": "This will be your luggage, I suppose?",
  "49324": "How could that bring you?",
  "49325": "But all our praises why should lords engross?",
  "49326": "And what then would you say?",
  "49327": "What is your opinion on the matter?",
  "49328": "Pictures are like wine, and want age, you think?",
  "49329": "Where is the entrance?",
  "49330": "The barricade?",
  "49331": "What is life at all?",
  "49332": "If you please, sir, should I have no brandy nor nothing to give the poor creetur?",
  "49333": "Is he kind to her?",
  "49334": "Who is conducting the prosecution?",
  "49335": "Is it mingled with anger or hate?",
  "49336": "What had he to do, indeed?",
  "49337": "Why, what, madam, does it signify what I think?",
  "49338": "Will it be believed that the night of so brilliant a day was for me a night of anguish and perplexity?",
  "49339": "Is not this an agreeable surprise?",
  "49340": "What can you not understand?",
  "49341": "Yes, but where?",
  "49342": "What did you burn 'em for?",
  "49343": "But you, messieurs, you whom I think it an honor to call my friends, since you have been willing to accept that title, what will become of you in the meantime?",
  "49344": "But what does that signify?",
  "49345": "Has it indeed?",
  "49346": "What do you want, sir?",
  "49347": "How did that help you?",
  "49348": "Let me hear it?",
  "49349": "But then again, what has the whale to say?",
  "49350": "What power?",
  "49351": "Surely he has some opinion?",
  "49352": "Will it be soon?",
  "49353": "Must I, then?",
  "49354": "Do you call that nourishment?",
  "49355": "What WERE these things?",
  "49356": "Polo?",
  "49357": "Does he like the moor?",
  "49358": "What, dares the villain write in such base terms?",
  "49359": "But what can I do?",
  "49360": "You are quite sure?",
  "49361": "Publish what, you unreasonable man?",
  "49362": "And where do you come from?",
  "49363": "What letter do you mean she returned unopened?",
  "49364": "Why should I not stay here?",
  "49365": "Has any modern state as yet succeeded in incorporating in its civil constitution such provisions as will ensure to all classes of its subjects any considerable share in the common good?",
  "49366": "You insist?",
  "49367": "What's the motive?",
  "49368": "Could he not hinder that, by persuading her out of her system of privation?",
  "49369": "Well, mon cher, what are you doing personally?",
  "49370": "What did he know of himself?",
  "49371": "What is the young lady's name?",
  "49372": "Shall I adventure?",
  "49373": "Is that his child?",
  "49374": "Then, sire?",
  "49375": "Object to in them?",
  "49376": "Have you any thing further?",
  "49377": "Why, what do they want with more?",
  "49378": "You would wish a notary to be sent for then?",
  "49379": "Is HE her uncle?",
  "49380": "And is it really so beautiful as they say?",
  "49381": "Do you not see?",
  "49382": "Look?",
  "49383": "Do you understand, officer?",
  "49384": "From your husband?",
  "49385": "And who are you to teach me?",
  "49386": "You went home?",
  "49387": "Is not that stonework?",
  "49388": "You order me to receive his friends, too, I suppose?",
  "49389": "Have you any?",
  "49390": "Why should I stay here alone?",
  "49391": "Is my lord pleased with his escort?",
  "49392": "Who will lead us through the land?",
  "49393": "Is it a holiday?",
  "49394": "But where did he find it?",
  "49395": "Then I am not like him, am I?",
  "49396": "Have I a friend here?",
  "49397": "On an omnibus?",
  "49398": "And for what reason?",
  "49399": "And in our opinion the guardians ought to have both these qualities?",
  "49400": "What have they done to my hair?",
  "49401": "Have you ever slept, my friend, in a grove of orange trees in flower?",
  "49402": "But for air to breathe on the road?",
  "49403": "Is not some idea expressed in the act of exhuming the bones after the flesh is decayed ?",
  "49404": "Can I wipe my face now?",
  "49405": "In a game of tennis?",
  "49406": "With what will you save it?",
  "49407": "Cousin, what's the matter?",
  "49408": "May we talk?",
  "49409": "Will you be improved?",
  "49410": "Are you rich, that you may pay for courtiers?",
  "49411": "And has not her own avarice been sufficiently punished by the ruin of her own hopes and the loss of the property by which she set so much store?",
  "49412": "Why do you not go back?",
  "49413": "But tell me all about it?",
  "49414": "And why do you mean to do such a horrible thing?",
  "49415": "What do YOU think of what the prince has just been saying?",
  "49416": "What need you fear?",
  "49417": "You say you fear nothing but death?",
  "49418": "Who would believe, that a childish fault should be productive of such melancholy consequences?",
  "49419": "And my sisters?",
  "49420": "Could the diplomat hold it?",
  "49421": "Would you, therefore, that your physician heal the bodily evil?",
  "49422": "Will you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine wanderer?",
  "49423": "Had something gone wrong with the bank?",
  "49424": "Suppose, for instance, that he should be imprisoned for two months, should he be allowed to return to his living at the expiration of that term?",
  "49425": "What was this universe?",
  "49426": "What million?",
  "49427": "Will you then, in the presence of these two friends, accept me as your future husband, and plight me your vow of truth and love?",
  "49428": "Why are we to love prejudices, merely because they are prejudices?",
  "49429": "D'you remember what you said to me the other day?",
  "49430": "And did he take it?",
  "49431": "Did you ever see a crocodile overcome?",
  "49432": "Did you see the nursing home!?",
  "49433": "My friend deceive me?",
  "49434": "Well, my dear, what is it?",
  "49435": "Would you fear to go, perhaps to your death, for this imperilled man?",
  "49436": "Must I go?",
  "49437": "Why speak, when words cannot express what one feels?",
  "49438": "Who is to prevent me?",
  "49439": "Of what was he in pursuit?",
  "49440": "Can you not recognize something undisturbed and peaceful among disturbance and trouble?",
  "49441": "And you, my lord?",
  "49442": "What was behind their competent stare?",
  "49443": "And how did this despatch reach you?",
  "49444": "But how were they to be got at?",
  "49445": "What should I speak to him for?",
  "49446": "Tabooed?",
  "49447": "Not?",
  "49448": "Nor running a chance of arrest?",
  "49449": "Who said I wanted to?",
  "49450": "Impossible?",
  "49451": "But wherefore do I awake this remembrance?",
  "49452": "But why are you going?",
  "49453": "To the left?",
  "49454": "How can it be that he should think otherwise?",
  "49455": "What drives him to it?",
  "49456": "How in the name of reason can I be asked to eat a mutton chop?",
  "49457": "Who knows whether these opacities will not become transparent?",
  "49458": "Eh, what?",
  "49459": "What on earth are you raving about?",
  "49460": "What is it but the worst and last form of intellectualism, this love of yours for passion and the animal instincts?",
  "49461": "But what do you mean?",
  "49462": "With this conviction, would he have left the head apothecary in that town?",
  "49463": "Theatres, evening parties, dinners in town?",
  "49464": "What atonement shall we offer him?",
  "49465": "Does HE suppose that people will pay him only to come and sit with them and go away again?",
  "49466": "What have you got?",
  "49467": "Are you coming up there now?",
  "49468": "Have you seen 'em lately?",
  "49469": "How should this same new wisdom be started up and established?",
  "49470": "What are you, and what may your business in this house be?",
  "49471": "Do these belong to the cardinal?",
  "49472": "So that's angel number one?",
  "49473": "Then it's all right?",
  "49474": "Who are you, my lad?",
  "49475": "Baisemeaux?",
  "49476": "What month did we meet him?",
  "49477": "How about the cross?",
  "49478": "In these circumstances what was more natural than that some should advocate a return to the classics and all that the classics enshrined?",
  "49479": "What did they call the wretched being?",
  "49480": "Did he not make speeches in the lobby to show how villainous that decision was, and how it ought to be overthrown?",
  "49481": "When do you go back again?",
  "49482": "What say they?",
  "49483": "Say summat?",
  "49484": "But what is there in common between these rude outlines of instinctive organization and the true social science?",
  "49485": "I wish to soothe him, yet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of every hope of consolation, to live?",
  "49486": "Slight, what moved you to be thus impertinent?",
  "49487": "Or from the fact that I have escaped, that I have completely fled, that I am finally free again and am standing like a child under the sky?",
  "49488": "What does he wish you to do?",
  "49489": "How shall I ever thank you?",
  "49490": "Could she be happy with this jungle waif?",
  "49491": "Had he, in lending to this stranger the aid of his key, and in making some other man than himself emerge from that portal, the pure and disinterested intention of rescuing an assassin?",
  "49492": "You must wait for what?",
  "49493": "Then she is dead?",
  "49494": "But when are you free?",
  "49495": "How could such a collection be here, where you see everything except the inside of one little cupboard and a few boxes?",
  "49496": "What's your business in this apartment?",
  "49497": "Who can calculate the depth of affection expressed in that enthusiastic SO?",
  "49498": "Their eyes?",
  "49499": "Was not that everything?",
  "49500": "Dirty?",
  "49501": "Raissa, dear, what's the matter with you?",
  "49502": "What consequence is that to me?",
  "49503": "Is she your mistress?",
  "49504": "Do you know what?",
  "49505": "How would you prevent it?",
  "49506": "But where are the body o 'em?",
  "49507": "What's up?",
  "49508": "And what shall I say to her?",
  "49509": "Why did you not tell him that when he was living?",
  "49510": "Must there not have been a custodian of the shrine?",
  "49511": "Eh?",
  "49512": "And after they have arrived at years of discretion by the care of their parents, are the inconveniencies attending their separation more certain than their foresight of these inconveniencies and their care of avoiding them by a close union and confederacy?",

  "49514": "Might I hope to be saved?",
  "49515": "You'll be no more jealous?",
  "49516": "Do you behold the beauty and the wisdom here?",
  "49517": "What is it that these have done?",
  "49518": "Was he a politician?",
  "49519": "Darnay?",
  "49520": "But are they the same as fire and snow?",
  "49521": "Why do you bring your prolifigate companions here?",
  "49522": "What'll sting him?",
  "49523": "Who is giving the reception?",
  "49524": "Have we ceased to be men?",
  "49525": "And did he not help you to rise to his own level, so that you, little by little, became his assistant in all his undertakings?",
  "49526": "What music?",

  "49773": "Sing, sir?",
  "49774": "Then, shall the man who is too weak to work be refused a right to the ownership of a coat?",
  "49775": "Are you in the police yourself?",
  "49776": "What hope could they entertain that any portion of the old continent still existed beyond that dreary barrier?",
  "49777": "And what is the name of this village?",
  "49778": "Are you going away, then?",
  "49779": "Was not the secret told me, in the natural recoil of my heart at the first sight of him, and as often as I have seen him since?",
  "49780": "Now, do you want a horse, or will you go afoot?",
  "49781": "Do you not understand?",

  "49795": "What do you propose?",
  "49796": "Is it true that you want to marry her?",
  "49797": "That's to say, you think there's a lack of something in me?",
  "49798": "Is it consistent with the proper dignity and the manly character of a nation?",
  "49799": "When did it come?",
  "49800": "Well, and do you think that those who say so are wrong?",
  "49801": "Come now, which of the two shall speak first?",
  "49802": "Are you so much?",
  "49803": "Have you got any money?",
  "49804": "Like what she used to be, or like what she was in the carriage?",
  "49805": "Does it, in dealing with other nations, civilized or backward, propose what is palpably to its own advantage, or is it evidently disinterested?",
  "49806": "Why have you not sent to me?",

  "49812": "A dog or a baby, eh?",
  "49813": "Would you have me indeed, annihilate the memory of the bond between us?",
  "49814": "Does not the timocratical man change into the oligarchical on this wise?",
  "49815": "Where's your warrant?",

  "49862": "Do you mean it's cut out of a single crystal?",
  "49863": "But would his men obey orders?",
  "49864": "In view of our moral, social, and political responsibilities, can we do this?",
  "49865": "Would a man, think you, give YOU up if you were poor?",
  "49866": "What good are we doing with all this ado?",
  "49867": "Heigh ha?",
  "49868": "Or did it come through the post?",
  "49869": "Where are your passports?",
  "49870": "Why show me this, if I am past all hope?",

  "49930": "Is it all union and harmony in your ranks?",
  "49931": "Who is sufficient to foresee all things, who to guard beforehand against future ills?",

  "49933": "What is it that I tell you?",
  "49934": "Good reader, why shall not the truth be told here?",
  "49935": "And why should she marry?",
  "49936": "If it was not?",
  "49937": "Do you wish me to do so?",
  "49938": "Get up?",
  "49939": "Was this a reality?",
  "49940": "I wonder if we're going right?",
  "49941": "Why have you mixed your name up in any thing so ridiculous?",
  "49942": "Is anything the matter here?",
  "49943": "But what is the good of loving her?",
  "49944": "I suppose this condition is one which a man of honour may accept?",
  "49945": "How long has it been wise?",
  "49946": "But how can I go on, when I's got no money?",
  "49947": "Why not apply it, then, upon this question?",
  "49948": "Should we have left behind us those poor, exhausted soldiers, who fondly counted on being able to start afresh as soon as they had somewhat refreshed their stiffened legs?",
  "49949": "Will this do?",
  "49950": "Why do we obey?",
  "49951": "But how shall I address the minister?",
  "49952": "What's his name going to be?",
  "49953": "He defies the usurer, does he?",
  "49954": "What's true?",
  "49955": "Have I guessed truly?",
  "49956": "Devil take it, what did you do in there?",
  "49957": "But be their shortcomings ever so great and many, who would dispense with these works?",
  "49958": "These and many other questions arise in my mind, but what is the good of asking them now?",
  "49959": "Do you know what you have done?",
  "49960": "What key?",
  "49961": "Fine sentiments, you say?",
  "49962": "Is he not so?",
  "49963": "Who be ye?",
  "49964": "If you are so ready, young ladies, to chop and change, do you suppose that she is?",
  "49965": "Shall man its search endure?",
  "49966": "Who should I halt for?",
  "49967": "Do they know him?",
  "49968": "Did she return home?",
  "49969": "She's been talking, has she?",
  "49970": "Did he die in the hospital?",
  "49971": "You do?",
  "49972": "Or does she exert a choice, and prefer certain males?",

  "49987": "And yet what is the feeling of lovers when they recognize a lyre, or a garment, or anything else which the beloved has been in the habit of using?",
  "49988": "As if one were frighted?",
  "49989": "Is there any one here who has stout loins and heart?",
  "49990": "Is it doubted, then, that the plan I propose, if adopted, would shorten the war, and thus lessen its expenditure of money and of blood?",
  "49991": "How dare you cast eyes on him when I had forbidden it?",
  "49992": "Would it not be expedient that he should take the lady at her word and escape?",
  "49993": "The poor lieutenant?",

  "50005": "Do you think I am to be imposed upon by that northern accent, which you have assumed?",
  "50006": "I suppose you've heard of me?",
  "50007": "You like my new suit?",
  "50008": "What, then, do you suppose?",
  "50009": "Julie?",
  "50010": "Now you understand me?",
  "50011": "Candy man, have you a sweetheart anywhere with hair as long and soft as that?",
  "50012": "How can she stay in the town where you are?",
  "50013": "Who's sending him back?",
  "50014": "Or, why are so many witnesses summoned, and so many artifices practised, to discover what so easy an experiment would infallibly reveal?",
  "50015": "Can I appoint you my executor?",
  "50016": "How about the horses?",
  "50017": "Do you really know any others who have it?",
  "50018": "How will you give me notice of it?",
  "50019": "And the goldsmith?",
  "50020": "Why, I hope you will not a hawking now, will you?",
  "50021": "You do not intend to be his wife?",
  "50022": "How know you it?",
  "50023": "How had he come to such a pass?",
  "50024": "But why should not I wear pink ribbons?",
  "50025": "For who could have forborne?",
  "50026": "But what do you propose to do?",
  "50027": "How could you so cruel?",
  "50028": "That is to say, you would rather not?",
  "50029": "Could this have any connection with the crime?",
  "50030": "Why am I asked what next shall see the light?",
  "50031": "Why did he feel that it was not unwatchful?",
  "50032": "Where's that other beast?",
  "50033": "What would it cost, sir, if we stopped here?",
  "50034": "Now, where is the romance in all that?",
  "50035": "And the same wages as he had?",
  "50036": "No one will be less likely to commit adultery, or to dishonour his father and mother, or to fall in his religious duties?",
  "50037": "That you think it would be so charming?",
  "50038": "What means it?",
  "50039": "Does it belong to the smaller or to the larger of the two?",
  "50040": "Are we to have nothing tonight?",
  "50041": "Why, my brave horses, why be left behind?",
  "50042": "That their genius should not have in it, even after the lapse of ages, some little of heaven?",
  "50043": "Why, cannot you see that they are all infatuated with pride and vanity?",
  "50044": "Had she not guessed anything, seen anything, comprehended anything?",
  "50045": "And what then, sir?",
  "50046": "That you do not wish to compromise her?",
  "50047": "Which is the best?",
  "50048": "Wherefore, then, should I be dissatisfied?",
  "50049": "How are my father and mother?",
  "50050": "How much had he written away?",
  "50051": "Will your excellency be so good as to mount the shoulders of two of our men, they will carry you ashore?",
  "50052": "You see that pile of pig iron?",
  "50053": "What could he wish or look for that he would not have obtained through my friendship?",
  "50054": "Here, take this,' continued he, after rapidly writing the few lines I brought to your excellency, and upon receipt of which you deigned to receive me into your service, and proudly I ask whether your excellency has ever had cause to repent having done so?",
  "50055": "Are you?",
  "50056": "Can you tell a good many fighting stories?",
  "50057": "What bride?",
  "50058": "Boythorn?",
  "50059": "Will that suit you?",
  "50060": "Where is the boat in which you came, gentlemen?",
  "50061": "What news?",
  "50062": "Is there any city which he might name?",
  "50063": "Will your majesty permit me to express a contrary opinion?",
  "50064": "What little gell's this?",
  "50065": "Who's the stranger?",
  "50066": "Did you hear us?",
  "50067": "Do the dead come back?",
  "50068": "Your wound?",
  "50069": "Why, did you know her, papa?",
  "50070": "Why was that corner chosen to write it on?",
  "50071": "How can one believe a woman after that?",
  "50072": "Why give it as a reason for not coming now?",
  "50073": "Only that?",
  "50074": "What do you think he wants to do?",
  "50075": "What ails us gazing where all seen is hollow?",
  "50076": "And when you want to buy a ship, the shipwright or the pilot would be better?",
  "50077": "How do you know that?",
  "50078": "How could it be possible for us to disobey your commands?",
  "50079": "But in what sense?",
  "50080": "About whom?",
  "50081": "Where, where are you going to?",
  "50082": "Why not you also?",
  "50083": "After her having been what she was?",
  "50084": "It was you, then, who wrote to him?",
  "50085": "What would you have me do?",
  "50086": "How can I dare to form a scheme, when I am aware that the chance of success must be so strong against me?",
  "50087": "Have you gone cracked, my good friend?",
  "50088": "How else can we explain her frenzied anxiety that her second one should not enter it?",
  "50089": "If this be the design of it, who can so properly be the inquisitors for the nation as the representatives of the nation themselves?",
  "50090": "Why spoil those apples?",
  "50091": "If the charge be incapacity, what evidence will support it?",
  "50092": "Do you play then?",
  "50093": "Will he ever return?",
  "50094": "Are there any witnesses?",
  "50095": "If you have to draw a man who is in motion, or lifting or pulling, or carrying a weight equal to his own, in what way must you set on his legs below his body?",
  "50096": "What is life, and what is death?",
  "50097": "What would happen then?",
  "50098": "Was this the banquet he prepar'd for us?",
  "50099": "What then gives us so great a propension to ascribe an identity to these successive perceptions, and to suppose ourselves possest of an invariable and uninterrupted existence through the whole course of our lives?",
  "50100": "If so, what became of them in those dreadful days?",
  "50101": "How can we here?",
  "50102": "Did he understand that he had made a grave mistake?",
  "50103": "Nor courage either?",
  "50104": "Now will you do what I want you to?",
  "50105": "No light repartee, have you, old bean?",
  "50106": "How did you word your inquiries?",
  "50107": "Can we not avoid them by keeping to the shore?",
  "50108": "Is it improper and unsafe to intermix the different powers of government in the same body of men?",
  "50109": "Do you promise to deliver it?",
  "50110": "How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil?",
  "50111": "Who are you?",
  "50112": "What is your name?",
  "50113": "Did you see him then?",
  "50114": "Then I suppose I was to hold my tongue and say nothing?",
  "50115": "How could the fruits follow?",
  "50116": "His name?",
  "50117": "Why the devil have they any stairs with such windows?",
  "50118": "What made you open it?",
  "50119": "You have seen him at work?",
  "50120": "Where else can I ask him?",
  "50121": "But can we not descend?",
  "50122": "Pip, will you tell me something?",
  "50123": "What lunacy is this, that haunts this man?",
  "50124": "Say, how long are you going to stay here?",
  "50125": "How shall I make my music now?",
  "50126": "Can I never act for you, and you for me?",
  "50127": "Do you think it is true?",
  "50128": "How would you like that?",
  "50129": "Why is she so excruciatingly beautiful that I cannot be angry with her, even now?",
  "50130": "That is your affair?",
  "50131": "You know he shot his brother?",
  "50132": "What noise was that?",
  "50133": "What would you give that you could help loving me?",
  "50134": "Do we suppose that principle, whatever it may be in man, which has to do with justice and injustice, to be inferior to the body?",
  "50135": "Yes, what it is?",
  "50136": "Where had he seen those lineaments?",
  "50137": "Of what was I speaking?",
  "50138": "Never in moderation?",
  "50139": "Is the other one stuffed also?",
  "50140": "What best wishes?",
  "50141": "I mean the one with the three naked women?",
  "50142": "Why, who else could I possibly suspect?",
  "50143": "What made you leave me to come here alone?",
  "50144": "Something will turn up?",
  "50145": "Abandon this subject altogether, and again jeer at the monks and ridicule the nuns?",
  "50146": "Have these very matters ever produced any difficulty amongst us?",
  "50147": "Have I not also critics who do not spare me?",
  "50148": "What avails recrimination over matters wholly past recall?",
  "50149": "It die?",
  "50150": "But if he had escaped?",
  "50151": "Who was that insolent fellow?",
  "50152": "What new mystery was this?",
  "50153": "What do I think of it?",
  "50154": "Is not this unavoidable?",
  "50155": "Have you spoken to her?",
  "50156": "But what could it do, if any danger came?",
  "50157": "Could it be for any other reason than that he did not want to see it, and if so was he not a traitor to the cause of truth?",
  "50158": "Why are better results attained under scientific management than under the other types?",
  "50159": "Ah, a weapon?",
  "50160": "Run away?",
  "50161": "What was he, then?",
  "50162": "Matter?",
  "50163": "Not paralysis, I hope?",
  "50164": "Run away?",
  "50165": "What does he say?",
  "50166": "Why is it that the peace of the country is disturbed in order that one people may assume to judge of what another people should do?",
  "50167": "So you think he'll make her an offer today?",
  "50168": "But where is he?",
  "50169": "It was the only letter you had?",
  "50170": "You have no explanation yourself of the tragedy?",
  "50171": "What do you mean by having made a stiff?",
  "50172": "What different armour should I need?",
  "50173": "Should he abandon her?",
  "50174": "Who is with him?",
  "50175": "Can you bear witness that you're no better than a fool?",
  "50176": "What should I do with a translation?",
  "50177": "You did not get my letter?",
  "50178": "By whom was she espied, and how entrapped?",
  "50179": "Is she a very massive person?",
  "50180": "And what is your opinion?",
  "50181": "According to scientific notions of inertia and force, what ought to be the result?",
  "50182": "And your address?",
  "50183": "What sort of husband can he be?",
  "50184": "How do they use to be?",
  "50185": "Why should we?",
  "50186": "What are you doing there, you rascal?",
  "50187": "Convicts?",
  "50188": "Why, then, are you about to betray it to me?",
  "50189": "But even in that case, may he have no object beyond his present station, to which he may sacrifice his independence?",
  "50190": "And powder, and bullets?",
  "50191": "If your husband thinks fit to keep you in the dark over this matter, is it for me, who has only learned the true facts under the pledge of professional secrecy, to tell what he has withheld?",
  "50192": "Have you had one of your bad nights?",
  "50193": "What, my friends, must be the consequences of this agitation?",
  "50194": "Can I do anything for you, gentlemen?",
  "50195": "Is he not a beauty?",
  "50196": "Could he still rise and regain his footing in his conscience upon something solid?",
  "50197": "Is it not indeed great enough, sire?",
  "50198": "Are you ambitious, and do you seek after the greatnesses of the earth?",
  "50199": "When they have no leaves and look gray and brown and dry, how can you tell whether they are dead or alive?",
  "50200": "Would we be able to see those pictures?",
  "50201": "Then if children make so much trouble, why do people have 'em?",
  "50202": "And you never confined your patients?",
  "50203": "How could you be so obstinate?",
  "50204": "Tom, what on earth ails that cat?",
  "50205": "If he had not had his 'profonde' what would he have done?",
  "50206": "What is to be done with her, then?",
  "50207": "Do you know what it is?",
  "50208": "I do something?",
  "50209": "Which way went he, young man?",
  "50210": "Are you coming to this ball?",
  "50211": "Why did he not correct our judgment at the start?",
  "50212": "How can one deceive these dear little birds, when they look at one so sweetly and confidingly?",
  "50213": "What is the matter at home?",
  "50214": "Is there any sense in it?",
  "50215": "And where is he going?",
  "50216": "Well, what have I to do with that?",
  "50217": "Do you not consume supplies as fast as you get them forward?",
  "50218": "But, what am I saying?",
  "50219": "Shall we try argument?",
  "50220": "She is at home?",
  "50221": "Verdurin?",
  "50222": "Then I asked if there were many clerks?",
  "50223": "How can he talk like that?",
  "50224": "But who gave you leave to cease eating mutton?",
  "50225": "And what can one do?",
  "50226": "Yes, that is the doctor we've been sewing for, is it?",
  "50227": "What pamphlet is this?",
  "50228": "Was it not for these causes that you send for me when the great trouble came?",
  "50229": "May I live with you, and tend upon you as I used to do?",
  "50230": "Will you unclasp your hand?",
  "50231": "Do you see this same ram?",
  "50232": "Shall I go and offer her my services?",
  "50233": "And why does the minister keep his hand over his heart?",
  "50234": "Who keeps house here?",
  "50235": "Are they not bubbles?",
  "50236": "How is all with you?",
  "50237": "Tasting?",
  "50238": "What are his qualifications?",
  "50239": "Where did you start from?",
  "50240": "Could anything cause us to swerve to one side?",
  "50241": "And are not both the city and the entire temple now full of the dead bodies of your countrymen?",
  "50242": "You dine and sleep here, of course?",
  "50243": "What else could I look for, being what I am, and leading such a life as mine?",
  "50244": "Where is this poor giant, or this poor wretch of a vanquished knight, to find her?",
  "50245": "It is the first time, then, that you ever went to that house?",
  "50246": "How may we pass that which is impassable?",
  "50247": "In what stables champed these sleek, nervous horses and rested the gorgeous carriages?",
  "50248": "And what am I to tell your father?",
  "50249": "My father is well, is he not?",
  "50250": "Was it going farther from, or nearing, the disc?",
  "50251": "How is this?",
  "50252": "Recollect, my lord, if he did not say something a little like that to you?",
  "50253": "Is he really her cousin, as he says?",
  "50254": "Who's to prevent me?",
  "50255": "Why dig up the pestilence from the pit in which it is buried?",
  "50256": "The other question?",
  "50257": "I may go on?",
  "50258": "And by whom?",
  "50259": "It is true, then?",
  "50260": "Should an ass exceed me in fortitude?",
  "50261": "Would the island hold together till then?",
  "50262": "No, why should you?",
  "50263": "What can I do sir?",
  "50264": "Should I have remained in that house, near you and them, if I did not love them?",
  "50265": "And this letter?",
  "50266": "What is the matter?",
  "50267": "And if it be so, what is it?",
  "50268": "Mother, what are you crying for?",
  "50269": "Were I to allow you to march out, what security can I have that you will not join them, and afterwards fight against me?",
  "50270": "Reinforcements?",
  "50271": "What would it be right to do?",
  "50272": "What's up with you?",
  "50273": "Should it ever be said that he had robbed those old men, whom he so truly and so tenderly loved in his heart of hearts?",
  "50274": "What made you think he'd ceased to take any interest in the case?",
  "50275": "Is it anything I have done that has pulled you down like that?",
  "50276": "What could my father mean by sending me to be an inmate in this strange family?",
  "50277": "You mean you'll have no quarrel with me?",
  "50278": "Was he awake or was he asleep?",
  "50279": "Well, but if I bought the mill, and allowed your husband to act as my manager in the same way, how then?",
  "50280": "What am I to do if I love him and the other one too?",
  "50281": "And have you come from far like this?",
  "50282": "And what did I tell 'ee?",
  "50283": "Could she, who had been so active in the getting up of the funeral triumph, do less than exult?",
  "50284": "Who now will tell the ladies that I would hie me thither?",
  "50285": "What is genius?",
  "50286": "You have taken care, I hope, of the casket I sent you to lock up?",
  "50287": "What evils?",
  "50288": "And is it wounded?",
  "50289": "What recollections of boyhood and innocence might have been flitting across his brain?",
  "50290": "What noise is that?",
  "50291": "No dignity in whaling?",
  "50292": "Why could they not wait a little?",
  "50293": "No apology, I suppose?",
  "50294": "What are you thinking of?",
  "50295": "How have I offended?",
  "50296": "Why should we be unable to preserve a remembrance of them?",
  "50297": "There is something else you wanted to say?",
  "50298": "Was I not right in saying at the outset that, relatively to the tax, we are behind our institutions?",
  "50299": "What charge, sir?",
  "50300": "Did you see no one?",
  "50301": "Oh, may I get this rose?",
  "50302": "He asked me whether I would go with him?",
  "50303": "Why did you leave him on the road?",
  "50304": "And in such a case what is one to say?",
  "50305": "But as I am not bound to give in to your plans, any more than you are compelled to submit to mine, may I ask to know if you have formed any which depend on my assistance?",
  "50306": "Yes, why?",
  "50307": "To which of us?",
  "50308": "Could we not break it?",
  "50309": "What does he drink?",
  "50310": "Is this the part of wise men, engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty?",
  "50311": "Cannot you describe her?",
  "50312": "And that which is not more or less a harmony is not more or less harmonized?",
  "50313": "A joke?",

  "50876": "What do you think of that interrogator?",
  "50877": "Nelly, do you never dream queer dreams?",
  "50878": "What does he preach?",
  "50879": "And did you see anything?",
  "50880": "Whither are you bound?",
  "50881": "Well, cousin, are you ready to go to meeting?",
  "50882": "And because we think right to destroy you, do you think that you have any right to destroy us in return, and your country as far as in you lies?",

  "52656": "Does he think he's grand, when he's bullied a sensitive creature, ten times as sensitive as himself?",
  "52657": "What is the garb or sign of mourning?",
  "52658": "Those studs were enclosed in a little rosewood box which he held under his arm?",
  "52659": "Besides, how can you marry?",
  "52660": "You, count, who are more than mortal, will, I am sure, lead me to death by a pleasant path, will you not?",
  "52661": "Why will she not speak to me?",
  "52662": "Is it broken off?",
  "52663": "And what does IT live on?",
  "52664": "Would he not speak to me?",
  "52665": "Whom?",
  "52666": "Have you rambled through the brushwood, holding aside the branches, on account of the charming head which is coming on behind you?",
  "52667": "And as for his beauty, what care I?",
  "52668": "Who is it, mad woman?",
  "52669": "Why, what are you saying?",
  "52670": "And which method do I understand you to prefer?",
  "52671": "Will you never let me alone?",
  "52672": "Why should the tramp burn the body?",
  "52673": "What was he doing?",
  "52674": "Is it not so?",
  "52675": "What's the trouble, old scout?",
  "52676": "Do you mean that there is money, sir?",
  "52677": "Said he, and took my hand, what do you talk of an argument?",
  "52678": "Do you really mean that?",
  "52679": "How does this misfortune affect you?",
  "52680": "Then if the good and just man be thus superior in pleasure to the evil and unjust, his superiority will be infinitely greater in propriety of life and in beauty and virtue?",
  "52681": "Yet in what, if not in this marvellous train of coincidence, does the accidentally suggested opinion of the populace call upon us to believe?",
  "52682": "Now, why?",
  "52683": "Do I not think of you?",
  "52684": "Am I not?",
  "52685": "Do you see the connection?",
  "52686": "What should provoke her to be your enemy, unless she has made you advances which you have slighted?",

  "52689": "Girls?",
  "52690": "Oh, you do not know?",
  "52691": "How can you, who believe him to be so selfish, think that?",
  "52692": "Caused by a woman?",
  "52693": "What's that you are gabbling about there?",
  "52694": "Then what is it?",
  "52695": "I am to put myself right before the world by incurring debts which I know I can never pay?",
  "52696": "What then?",
  "52697": "What female heart can gold despise?",
  "52698": "Still?",
  "52699": "What are you to live on?",
  "52700": "And this keepsake that you keep under lock and key, and moon over at times, is that a remembrance from her?",
  "52701": "And where have we got to put our heads?",
  "52702": "Which way did they go?",
  "52703": "Where could you wait for me?",
  "52704": "How do people do to get a new place?",
  "52705": "Who is the fellow?",
  "52706": "And you know him?",
  "52707": "And now what are we going to do?",
  "52708": "Matrimonial?",
  "52709": "Are there any strangers?",
  "52710": "And what else was there?",
  "52711": "Suppose I say that?",
  "52712": "That you forsook your house and home?",
  "52713": "And if I were to decline?",
  "52714": "Who will remember it?",
  "52715": "Could he not rely on the sagacity of the faithful animal?",
  "52716": "Was this the ridiculous motive to all this passion?",
  "52717": "Then where is it?",
  "52718": "So you object to being called sonny, do you?",
  "52719": "Ought I to take the money?",
  "52720": "Would that be harm?",
  "52721": "Have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled that force must be called in to win back our love?",
  "52722": "Your son?",
  "52723": "I trust I give no offence to the companion of my youth, in submitting this proposition to his cooler judgement?",
  "52724": "E vero?",
  "52725": "You believe it, surely?",
  "52726": "These books?",
  "52727": "There, now you'll go and inform the king, will you not?",
  "52728": "But what good would it do her then, you know, when she was drowned?",
  "52729": "What does the city say to you?",
  "52730": "Did you ever meet her at home?",
  "52731": "I hope you are none the worse for your exertions tonight?",
  "52732": "Suppose, when they are engaged, and everything is smoothly arranged for their marriage, that you should step between them and renew your suit?",
  "52733": "And if you do so wish, surely you may hope to?",
  "52734": "But by that time the epic was decadent and dying?",
  "52735": "What shall I say more?",
  "52736": "How does it taste?",
  "52737": "And if they should altogether praise me, how could I go to sleep on THEIR praise?",
  "52738": "Have you any notion of self or substance?",
  "52739": "Is it very bad?",
  "52740": "Remember?",
  "52741": "And can you trust your missis?",
  "52742": "What, then, of revenge?",
  "52743": "Corrupting themselves and the men with whose passions they played?",
  "52744": "Did I not tell you so?",
  "52745": "And how?",
  "52746": "What inducement has the farmer, while following the plough, to lay aside his peaceful pursuit, and go to war with the farmer of another country?",

  "52755": "How are we to live?",
  "52756": "Why would you persuade me not to go out among my poor?",
  "52757": "How like you that, sir?",
  "52758": "Which shall sing?",
  "52759": "Do you mean he's a stranger?",
  "52760": "How, then, could he conceal the launch and yet have her at hand when wanted?",
  "52761": "Whither hurries this crowd like the waves of a furious sea under the torrents of a tropical sun pouring its heat upon our heads?",
  "52762": "Do they not know me?",
  "52763": "Why, what makes you ask that?",
  "52764": "How is one to help feeling sad?",
  "52765": "Is that trembling cry a song?",
  "52766": "Oh, my friend, why, think you, did I go so far round, why take so long to tell so simple a thing?",
  "52767": "Not married?",
  "52768": "And so the mad dog has strangled him?",

  "52777": "But silence, do you hear me?",
  "52778": "What love, what fidelity, what constancy is there equal to that of a nurse with good wages?",
  "52779": "Horatio?",
  "52780": "But whats the cause that you concealde me since?",
  "52781": "How then is it possible, that the same substance can at once be modifyed into that square table, and into this round one?",
  "52782": "What have you come for?",
  "52783": "In what?",
  "52784": "A change so shameful, say, what cause has wrought?",
  "52785": "Whither away so fast?",
  "52786": "You think the mummy was abstracted?",
  "52787": "Is he courteous?",

  "52791": "Capital?",
  "52792": "Well, are you talking?",
  "52793": "And when did you go down?",
  "52794": "Does my uncle think what YOU think?",
  "52795": "Do you not admit that society in its present state, like every man, has in its constitution all kinds of virtues and vices inherited from our ancestors?",
  "52796": "And what shall I do there?",
  "52797": "Am I all ready now?",

  "52800": "Castiglione die?",
  "52801": "Do you believe that I love you?",
  "52802": "Or where is the war on which a world was staked till now?",
  "52803": "But does that hare come here still?",
  "52804": "But which was the way?",
  "52805": "I suppose you have no hint to give me?",
  "52806": "And you are quite certain of having seen this fire?",
  "52807": "Can we possibly suppose that if governments had originated in a right principle, and had not an interest in pursuing a wrong one, the world could have been in the wretched and quarrelsome condition we have seen it?",

  "52809": "So you've found your folk?",
  "52810": "In morals too, is not THE TREE KNOWN BY THE FRUIT?",
  "52811": "Never studied for the stage?",
  "52812": "Will you just listen to me for a moment?",
  "52813": "Now will you think over my proposal, and meet me here the first fine day next week, and say if you are still in the same mind?",
  "52814": "Perhaps, but why?",
  "52815": "Do you, dear boy?",

  "52825": "Having got it, why do you give me the pain of looking at you for another moment, and seeing what you have become?",
  "52826": "And so you will not tell me?",
  "52827": "And does he not do so with reason?",
  "52828": "Have you seen them?",
  "52829": "But what was there to laugh at in it?",

  "52831": "Where was I then?",
  "52832": "I said, do you remember?",
  "52833": "If you keep me at this distance, how is it possible you and I can ever be acquainted?",
  "52834": "Is that true, and do you speak seriously?",
  "52835": "What reception could he expect?",
  "52836": "What do you think of all this?",
  "52837": "What still remaineth to me?",
  "52838": "Why not stay on quietly here, like us, and be jolly?",

  "52855": "Would it be quite regular, dear?",
  "52856": "Shall we wait breakfast for you?",
  "52857": "It is indigestion, no doubt?",
  "52858": "Can you guess, captain?",
  "52859": "But what can you hope to do?",
  "52860": "Cos why?",
  "52861": "But why?",

  "52863": "How know you?",
  "52864": "Is that a slip, or how explainable?",
  "52865": "Do you not know that it is an injury to another?",
  "52866": "What was the matter yesterday?",
  "52867": "You fear to acknowledge that your correspondent his deceived you?",
  "52868": "Absolution was pronounced over him again and again, but who ever gave him any assurance that he had fulfilled its conditions, and therefore could really confide in its efficacy?",
  "52869": "Why have I recorded it?",
  "52870": "What do I think to do?",
  "52871": "How are you, eh?",
  "52872": "Why have you mentioned him?",
  "52873": "What do you know about him?",
  "52874": "Do you know the sound of gold?",
  "52875": "Then perhaps you can tell me why my grandmother has brought me here?",

  "52882": "What have I done to her?",
  "52883": "What should my feelings be, do you suppose?",
  "52884": "Then, if your heart does, why not your hand?",
  "52885": "She's so horrible?",
  "52886": "What took it out?",
  "52887": "Might it not be that his acquittal or conviction would depend on what she might now learn from him?",
  "52888": "Is she old?",
  "52889": "What was it to me whom my uncle might choose to conceal in his house, where I was myself a guest only by tolerance?",
  "52890": "Is it under all of them?",
  "52891": "Is man, in the hour of triumphant ambition, so moderate, that we can be willing that he should attain power which places us at his mercy?",
  "52892": "And will he get this appointment?",
  "52893": "But where was the last place he was in?",
  "52894": "But now you are happy?",

  "52947": "Seriously, I'm not annoying you, am I?",
  "52948": "What is this cross they are both learning to kiss, and holding up between them?",
  "52949": "And why a coxcomb?",
  "52950": "Is it not the latter's mirror, reflection, echo, an abyss which is concentric with another abyss?",

  "53020": "You are not dreaming of it, are you?",
  "53021": "Who's somebody?",
  "53022": "That is your opinion, is it not?",
  "53023": "Then what do you suggest that we do?",

  "54613": "The earl asked whither he had gone thence?",
  "54614": "Now, was this distortion, this capacity for a perverted way of viewing things, a special or accidental case, or is such a general rule?",
  "54615": "For what was she made, anyhow?",
  "54616": "Gunnar asks why he was there away east?",
  "54617": "How came they acquainted?",
  "54618": "For he does now understand?",
  "54619": "What's to be done?",
  "54620": "Empty?",
  "54621": "An examination?",
  "54622": "Have you never seen your father give his visitors a drink or offer them a cup of coffee when they came to see him?",
  "54623": "Rummy, when you come to think of it, what?",
  "54624": "Yet why?",
  "54625": "What shall we do, boys, till the ladies return?",
  "54626": "Well, I'd like to know what sort of a beggar's brat this is?",
  "54627": "Will you tell us at last to what end you pretend to be conducting civilization?",
  "54628": "You are truly at my service, are you not?",
  "54629": "How now, what is this?",
  "54630": "Clym, you are not jealous?",
  "54631": "For, I beseech you, by what rule or standard do you judge, when you assert, that the line, in which I have supposed them to concur, cannot make the same right line with those two, that form so small an angle betwixt them?",
  "54632": "What is it like?",
  "54633": "How had all this happened?",
  "54634": "For the unusual tumult of that throbbing bosom ?",
  "54635": "Your mother?",
  "54636": "How much was there?",
  "54637": "Do you understand everything birds say?",
  "54638": "Where is the dacoit?",
  "54639": "Give in?",
  "54640": "Where can she be, then, since there is no light in any other room except the kitchen?",
  "54641": "What could this treachery be?",
  "54642": "Did he say he would give you a situation?",
  "54643": "Do you understand what you are doing?",
  "54644": "And must my words be thus interpreted?",
  "54645": "Have you asked her the question, then?",
  "54646": "And opinion is to have an opinion?",
  "54647": "Which of the six chose you?",
  "54648": "What does this signify?",
  "54649": "Would she not be more comfortable, as I suggested, at the hotel?",
  "54650": "You had a good journey?",
  "54651": "Or has that devil made you really dumb, when he struck his nasty hand on your jaw?",
  "54652": "For?",
  "54653": "Oh, grandpapa, did you not say the colt sold for five pounds more than you expected?",
  "54654": "Did you not charge him with unbridled insolence?",
  "54655": "Where are we going?",
  "54656": "Do you suppose the dryad will come out after we go away and take it for a scarf?",
  "54657": "And where are they?",
  "54658": "What will you do in a foreign land, an enemy's country?",
  "54659": "Where'd YOU come from?",
  "54660": "But have you remarked that sight is by far the most costly and complex piece of workmanship which the artificer of the senses ever contrived?",
  "54661": "His leg, forsooth?",
  "54662": "But would you allow me the favour of a minute's private conversation?",
  "54663": "And did he give you this letter?",
  "54664": "What inconvenience can it be?",
  "54665": "What do you expect, then?",
  "54666": "Whom do you suspect?",
  "54667": "And you laugh at the king, then?",
  "54668": "Ah?",
  "54669": "But what is a dog to know in its consciousness of madness?",
  "54670": "Will you try a bit of the beef?",
  "54671": "First of all, what is the name of this river?",
  "54672": "And you preached her sermons there, did you?",
  "54673": "Do you give lessons, ma'am?",
  "54674": "How are you going?",
  "54675": "Shall we preserve and transmit it to posterity?",
  "54676": "And should he, by an impression on the minds of his creatures, think fit to impart to them some event hid in the shades of time, yet unborn, to whom would the secret be revealed by immediate inspiration?",
  "54677": "Then are we to impose all our enactments on men and none of them on women?",
  "54678": "And now what are we to do?",
  "54679": "You want to know how we came here?",
  "54680": "What then are we to understand by the objection which this paper has combated?",
  "54681": "What could he do to move this crowd and definitely to win over public opinion?",
  "54682": "Can we send the child back to the asylum?",
  "54683": "And what plainer than that he treats him then as a beast of burden?",
  "54684": "The patch or the campaign?",
  "54685": "To act?",
  "54686": "Did you, indeed?",
  "54687": "I'll go to 'em tonight and sing a wedding song, hey?",
  "54688": "In the table?",
  "54689": "Did you hear, goodman?",
  "54690": "And you'll stick to it, mother?",
  "54691": "Why talk of me?",
  "54692": "But the quarter's notice?",
  "54693": "But why I had no notice of his ire?",
  "54694": "Or is one soul in the very least degree more or less, or more or less completely, a soul than another?",
  "54695": "Will the marquis honor me by a few moments' private conversation?",
  "54696": "What were they?",
  "54697": "I suppose he's in no immediate danger?",
  "54698": "Who shall regulate all the mixed conversation of our youth, male and female together, as is the fashion of this country?",
  "54699": "Had he, on the other hand, smoked too much?",
  "54700": "What castellan that received him in his castle ever made him pay his shot?",
  "54701": "But the lock?",
  "54702": "Shall I kiss your hand upon the contract?",
  "54703": "May I ask the name?",
  "54704": "What?",
  "54705": "Strangers?",
  "54706": "Or were they there from some ulterior motive?",
  "54707": "Does it?",
  "54708": "But you'll come back to dinner?",
  "54709": "Shall I open a flask?",
  "54710": "Why bother about human relationships?",
  "54711": "And will he bring me back a bear?",
  "54712": "What would that language have been?",
  "54713": "What more can I do?",
  "54714": "Have you cried your grief away?",
  "54715": "Have you picked many of your apples yet?",
  "54716": "What was going to happen to her henceforth?",
  "54717": "Shall my father be informed of your wish?",
  "54718": "To hide, in the nature of how many women?",
  "54719": "You believed in my good fortune in the old days, do you now doubt this true story?",
  "54720": "You've not met since that night?",
  "54721": "Will you try?",
  "54722": "What course do you intend to take?",
  "54723": "Now, how shall we settle this?",
  "54724": "What is it to you?",
  "54725": "Do you think that I was then dead to agony and remorse?",
  "54726": "Any news?",
  "54727": "Is there no end to it?",
  "54728": "But a ricordo of what?",
  "54729": "How many times have we had danger from this question?",
  "54730": "Which is the part in man, which, as he grows fatter, never gains flesh?",
  "54731": "And next, how does he live?",
  "54732": "Am not I here, whom you have made your creature?",
  "54733": "Do you want to hire any men?",
  "54734": "News?",
  "54735": "You are a scholar too, I dare say?",
  "54736": "Did you come here to fetch me?",
  "54737": "In praising his generosity, who can mingle any censure for such manifest prudence?",
  "54738": "Have you come to see me or my mother?",
  "54739": "Nelly gave it to him?",
  "54740": "What the devil do I see yonder?",
  "54741": "And your previous dreams, were they real too?",
  "54742": "Do you want to see me?",
  "54743": "Hucky, do you das't to go if I lead?",
  "54744": "Did you get here quickly?",
  "54745": "What was their reply?",
  "54746": "Does one know?",
  "54747": "What's the beadig of this?",
  "54748": "Not one word of comfort?",
  "54749": "May I ask of what breed he is sprung?",
  "54750": "What sort of grim adventure was it on which I had embarked?",
  "54751": "Would you have done it?",
  "54752": "Will you not give up this plan?",
  "54753": "But could you not be mended?",
  "54754": "Does that seem like too much work?",
  "54755": "Who are these creatures?",
  "54756": "What witnesses would support my statements?",
  "54757": "You remember what are the properties of two similar triangles?",
  "54758": "WELL, and how does success taste?",
  "54759": "She would be ashamed of her mother, you mean, and of her mother's brother too, eh?",
  "54760": "Mates, do you hear that?",
  "54761": "Of what do you complain?",
  "54762": "You know what it is to be in love?",
  "54763": "In the smuggling line?",
  "54764": "Do you wish to say anything further to him?",
  "54765": "Hussey?",
  "54766": "Had it not been pity so good a man should have been cast away?",
  "54767": "Why do we prize changing organism more than inorganic matter, unchanging and constant?",
  "54768": "But is this a defence?",
  "54769": "You perceive then the utter impossibility of escaping through your dungeon?",
  "54770": "You like this weather?",
  "54771": "Then, does he write?",
  "54772": "What of it, then?",
  "54773": "Well, are they at home, my good man?",
  "54774": "WAS IT A PARTISAN PROSECUTION?",
  "54775": "When houses are owned by loyal citizens, but are unoccupied?",
  "54776": "Are we really quite lost, your excellency?",
  "54777": "Look here, dear prince, BE so kind, will you?",
  "54778": "Is it not well that such men should be brought low?",
  "54779": "And what is the new one like?",
  "54780": "Do you not see how the old man who drives a cart looks anxiously about?",
  "54781": "What will you eat?",
  "54782": "Is my peace nothing?",
  "54783": "What business is 't of yours?",
  "54784": "You are right, clearness is what you wish, is it not?",
  "54785": "And you say this young man behaved himself well?",
  "54786": "Are we not to put on our diver's dresses?",
  "54787": "But for what purpose is it your idea that they should again so intimately meet?",
  "54788": "Let you steer?",
  "54789": "But, tell me, what do you ask?",
  "54790": "How about opening our letters?",
  "54791": "But what is the cause of this increasing humidity?",
  "54792": "Are you in contentment now?",
  "54793": "And from what?",
  "54794": "How much will that be?",
  "54795": "And in all these cases, the recollection may be derived from things either like or unlike?",
  "54796": "What are you staring at?",
  "54797": "Home?",
  "54798": "How much do I owe you?",
  "54799": "Of my old friends?",
  "54800": "The devil's agents may be of flesh and blood, may they not?",
  "54801": "Did she tell you of this?",
  "54802": "Do I date it?",
  "54803": "Or shall we say, that it is of any service in the conduct of life, and an assistant to prudence?",
  "54804": "What shall I try this time?",
  "54805": "Call you this dying?",
  "54806": "And why weep for this?",
  "54807": "How is it you are on foot?",
  "54808": "So you're a messenger of victory, eh?",
  "54809": "Had he eyebrows like that?",
  "54810": "What is there I care for?",
  "54811": "Was it still night?",
  "54812": "Who was this almost beardless young man, who was so glacial and so generous, who knew people's names, who knew all their names, and who opened his purse to them, who bullied rascals like a judge, and who paid them like a dupe?",
  "54813": "Why came I here to cast away my life?",
  "54814": "The old gentleman over the way?",
  "54815": "Did you say, four ladies?",
  "54816": "Do you still wish to dispose of all?",
  "54817": "Does he tell lies?",
  "54818": "I wonder what it can be?",
  "54819": "Why should this place lie idle?",
  "54820": "Do you see this little door and little house?",
  "54821": "Do these correspond to the phases of apprehension?",
  "54822": "Am I not a member of the consulting commission?",
  "54823": "What's your pay?",
  "54824": "Who told you so?",
  "54825": "For whom were the soldiers below at the carriage waiting?",
  "54826": "Must the citizen ever for a moment, or in the least degree, resign his conscience to the legislator?",
  "54827": "Do you want to cross the channel?",
  "54828": "But can this be so confidently said of sexual selection?",
  "54829": "And is there any hope of that, sir?",
  "54830": "Where are you going?",
  "54831": "You will appear at this ball?",
  "54832": "What did I come for?",
  "54833": "Whose?",
  "54834": "This is where he lives, is it?",
  "54835": "But what does all this mean?",
  "54836": "And have you a pale blue dress on?",
  "54837": "And in the course of that month?",
  "54838": "If there were one man who would carry you a medical reform and another who would oppose it, should you inquire which had the better motives or even the better brains?",
  "54839": "Who can live the same moment twice?",
  "54840": "What did he say in that one?",
  "54841": "Is it true that you received there a man who is your lover?",
  "54842": "Is any man, in these days, sensible, seeing what a racket we have to live among?",
  "54843": "Quis custodiet istos custodes?",
  "54844": "Let's sit here for a bit, shall we?",
  "54845": "How many days would it require to make two studs exactly like them?",
  "54846": "Then is not this test reliable?",
  "54847": "What could it be, once more?",
  "54848": "Have you neglected to obtain information on that point?",
  "54849": "When do the servants go to bed?",
  "54850": "Why take I not my pleasure when I may, seeing that I never need lack for occasions of trouble and vexation of spirit?",
  "54851": "He passes along the same path at the same hour, and to whom should he be going except to the convict?",
  "54852": "And the murderer?",
  "54853": "How might it come to pass that we should all die there, through anybody's hate?",
  "54854": "What did he do there?",
  "54855": "Are you not?",
  "54856": "And the queens?",
  "54857": "What are they doing?",
  "54858": "Len, you will make it all right?",
  "54859": "The car?",
  "54860": "Was he, or was he not, the father of the young girl?",
  "54861": "He only peeps?",
  "54862": "When will you come to see me?",
  "54863": "What would you wish for, girls, if you could have a wish granted?",
  "54864": "What can I be?",
  "54865": "Why, what were you going to do?",
  "54866": "How then could you have recognized me, if you have never seen my portrait or my person?",
  "54867": "Whose name?",
  "54868": "What does she carry?",
  "54869": "What has he got, this time?",
  "54870": "Why, what?",
  "54871": "Why had everybody been in such a frantic hurry in this matter?",
  "54872": "How old are they?",
  "54873": "How would a boy like that?",
  "54874": "O was she so?",
  "54875": "Because, if it was so long ago, how could the people about him have made that mistake of putting some of the trouble out of his head, after it was taken off, into mine?",
  "54876": "To place yourself under his protection?",
  "54877": "Why should I object?",
  "54878": "What but a future of patient labor?",
  "54879": "How is your father getting on?",
  "54880": "These walls are you going, gentlemen?",
  "54881": "Where is such a judge to be found?",
  "54882": "Why, then, is he not indemnified?",
  "54883": "Why did they do it?",
  "54884": "These were the exact words, my beloved husband, were they not?",
  "54885": "Is it for my own pleasure that I am at the farm or in the office from morning to night?",
  "54886": "He is not resident, then?",
  "54887": "Is the swallow in sight?",
  "54888": "What kind of fish?",
  "54889": "Where had she seen those lineaments before?",
  "54890": "Why must he?",
  "54891": "What has she written to me?",
  "54892": "Have you ever been on it?",
  "54893": "What do you mean?",
  "54894": "Are you sure she is safe?",
  "54895": "Can he be inconstant before being happy?",
  "54896": "Ah, your honor, how can you say so?",
  "54897": "If it be only a struggle for a new balance of power, who will guarantee, who can guarantee, the stable equilibrium of the new arrangement?",
  "54898": "Why should it not be known?",
  "54899": "What was the good of talking, any way?",
  "54900": "Because the higher he flies, the fewer?",
  "54901": "Think better of what?",
  "54902": "Should they end by both getting lost, and by furnishing two skeletons in a nook of that night?",
  "54903": "What is your name, my friend?",
  "54904": "Or could it be that within lay the secret to the treasure stores?",
  "54905": "Are you satisfied, gentlemen?",
  "54906": "The name of your ship?",
  "54907": "Wish to consult me on the matter?",
  "54908": "And can we tell, how long he may choose to respect those conditions?",
  "54909": "Do you press me to tell?",
  "54910": "How can I support this?",
  "54911": "How shall we live through the long winter here?",
  "54912": "You have actually seen the members of the legislature?",
  "54913": "And if he wakes up presently, where shall we be?",
  "54914": "And the best hack?",
  "54915": "Why do you not turn round and speak to me properly?",
  "54916": "What's in the bottle, boy?",
  "54917": "Of what was he thinking during this profound depression?",
  "54918": "How is it that it opposed no resistance to the motion of comets which have almost grazed the sun's surface?",
  "54919": "Who is that woman?",
  "54920": "Well then, do it, will you?",
  "54921": "Stolen from you?",
  "54922": "The fat woman who goes about in a green blouse?",
  "54923": "Who should quail while they do not?",
  "54924": "How many acres?",
  "54925": "Wherein especially does the poetry of our times differ from that of the last century?",
  "54926": "To stuff every hole with some kind of oakum?",
  "54927": "Do you not believe, then, that we women deserve to be loved?",
  "54928": "But what was the state of the conquerors?",
  "54929": "May I have the honor?",
  "54930": "Where is the gentle one?",
  "54931": "What is there now to warrant the condition of affairs presented by our friends over the river?",
  "54932": "Once more, how do you know?",
  "54933": "This must be a strange night to you, standing alone here with your counterpart on these street stones?",
  "54934": "But what are you talking about?",
  "54935": "Hold your tongue, will you?",
  "54936": "Who cares for me?",
  "54937": "When passed?",
  "54938": "How is it going?",
  "54939": "If, however, your wish should be one impossible to fulfill?",
  "54940": "Why do you not leave me alone?",
  "54941": "Where are they to come from?",
  "54942": "Louisa saw her when she came?",
  "54943": "Why did you look at the sunset?",
  "54944": "Why did they insist so strenuously upon this, and incorporate it into their philosophy?",
  "54945": "Shall I ring for candles, sir?",
  "54946": "Oh, why should I be made to worry?",
  "54947": "Have you found your tramp?",
  "54948": "With whom?",
  "54949": "Do you see the joke?",
  "54950": "But why this elaborate deception?",
  "54951": "Should you mind?",
  "54952": "And literature may be either true or false?",
  "54953": "Is there more, then?",
  "54954": "What if they had?",
  "54955": "HAS HE WIT?",
  "54956": "Lackeys?",
  "54957": "Why should we defer our joys?",
  "54958": "How is the poor little wounded girl?",
  "54959": "Can we do anything for you?",
  "54960": "I think I could?",
  "54961": "Was this a joke, then?",
  "54962": "Why does she come prowling here?",
  "54963": "There has been fighting, then?",
  "54964": "What irritated this mollusc?",
  "54965": "Or man, indeed?",
  "54966": "Where do you come from?",
  "54967": "What other reforms, among those which are being discussed by these two nations, could do as much toward promoting prosperity, toward the diminution of poverty, and the alleviation of suffering?",
  "54968": "Have you planned to come and live with us?",
  "54969": "I hope you suffer no inconvenience from the overturn, ma'am?",
  "54970": "Is not wounded vanity the mother of all tragedies?",
  "54971": "But why should it have been otherwise?",
  "54972": "Ask her, does she do this for amusement, or does she expect to earn money by it?",
  "54973": "Would that volatile mind, that inconstant heart, be likely to be fixed for a moment, even were it to gaze upon an angel?",
  "54974": "Lily, will you say that it shall be so?",
  "54975": "Pray you what do you mean, sir?",
  "54976": "Tomorrow, then?",
  "54977": "Into what whirlpool had she been dragged?",
  "54978": "Will nothing convince you?",
  "54979": "Do they fish for them in these days?",
  "54980": "And why of them to be ?",
  "54981": "And the horse?",
  "54982": "To what end was I born with exquisite faculties?",
  "54983": "Why yes, am I not devoted body and soul to your majesty?",
  "54984": "Why, what of them?",
  "54985": "Oh, but are you going to her?",
  "54986": "How is your uncle pleased with him?",
  "54987": "How the devil could it be otherwise in her frightful isolation?",
  "54988": "Would he not suddenly sink into the earth, leaving a barren and blasted spot, where, in due course of time, would be seen deadly nightshade, dogwood, henbane, and whatever else of vegetable wickedness the climate could produce, all flourishing with hideous luxuriance?",
  "54989": "Do you think that the tree really did cure toothache, if one believed in it?",
  "54990": "Then will you consider about it, neighbour?",
  "54991": "Hurt?",
  "54992": "Swerve me?",
  "54993": "And what kind was she?",
  "54994": "Monsieur, and in what respect not?",
  "54995": "Have you wanted money, father?",
  "54996": "Is not your city in my power?",
  "54997": "What is this ideal?",
  "54998": "Is an indefinite power to raise money dangerous in the hands of the federal government?",
  "54999": "What more can you demand?",
  "55000": "Taken forfeit of their mortgage?",
  "55001": "A boat?",
  "55002": "It is not so, brother?",
  "55003": "Any why not this evening?",
  "55004": "Has he been to sea?",

  "56190": "You are in mourning for some near relation?",
  "56191": "Do you know any who belong to the latter category?",
  "56192": "Now, what do you say about her doctor?",
  "56193": "Did your worship speak to me?",
  "56194": "Who are these people?",
  "56195": "Could it be an impartial one?",
  "56196": "What do you down here, my friend?",
  "56197": "Could he suspect my true identity?",
  "56198": "And the women?",
  "56199": "Suppose I do not want to be happy, what is the source of the obligation?",
  "56200": "Or the generous deed out of selfishness?",
  "56201": "Were you sent here to praise me?",
  "56202": "How do you feel now, dear?",
  "56203": "She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?",
  "56204": "You know him, then?",
  "56205": "Will he always come when you call him?",
  "56206": "And what has that to do with me?",
  "56207": "Why compliment him on being a romantic reactionary aristocrat?",
  "56208": "In the first place, and before everything else, sir, is the news as bad in your opinion as I am asked to believe?",
  "56209": "But how was it that the grooms knew it?",
  "56210": "Will you appoint a meeting for six months hence?",
  "56211": "Find it easy?",
  "56212": "Were they going over to the other side?",
  "56213": "So you will send me that book, dear count?",
  "56214": "But it's over now?",
  "56215": "Am I talking?",
  "56216": "And to what?",
  "56217": "Have I always hated you so much?",
  "56218": "How does he use it?",
  "56219": "You will sing with me?",
  "56220": "Grant?",
  "56221": "What did I borrow?",
  "56222": "Am I not clearly designated in that, captain?",
  "56223": "And with what purpose could he do that?",
  "56224": "What is it that this polypragmonetic ardelion to all the fiends of hell doth aim at?",
  "56225": "What has happened that you should speak like that?",
  "56226": "What means, then, this dithyramb upon property?",
  "56227": "And where afterwards?",
  "56228": "What reason was there for assuming any probability of an uprising in the city?",
  "56229": "Ah, friends, what shall I do?",
  "56230": "Do we not both take from the poor people that which they can ill spare?",
  "56231": "What is the place, then, upon which we stand?",
  "56232": "Is he a man of fortune?",
  "56233": "How dare to repeat experiments that had failed so often?",
  "56234": "There is still another influence, what do you say to that?",
  "56235": "What makes you ask?",
  "56236": "Now, who can this other letter be from?",
  "56237": "But how is it he is not already returned?",
  "56238": "What is to be the manner of her death?",
  "56239": "Wizard?",
  "56240": "And, conversely, that which has less of truth will also have less of essence?",
  "56241": "You mean that they would shipwreck?",
  "56242": "Swinging by the chain?",
  "56243": "What put it into your head, little mother?",
  "56244": "Then it is very thin wine?",
  "56245": "Did I offer to hit him or did I not?",
  "56246": "And what temperature may that be?",
  "56247": "Have you a pair of silent shoes?",
  "56248": "Who else should do so?",
  "56249": "And to what effect?",
  "56250": "I shall meet them there, and who knows what future advantages may result from the interview?",
  "56251": "Could it have been aught but a shipwreck which had drawn it under the water?",
  "56252": "The song?",
  "56253": "Shall you go?",
  "56254": "How are you, my dear?",
  "56255": "Why then not trace the rights of man to the creation of man?",
  "56256": "How did you know about it?",
  "56257": "How about that?",
  "56258": "Who knows it?",
  "56259": "You were alluding to the jerking movement of my hand every time I try to reach for anything?",
  "56260": "What the devil was you afraid of?",
  "56261": "What did he do before he went?",
  "56262": "Your alphabet?",
  "56263": "What's up?",
  "56264": "Which house is that?",
  "56265": "What's your real name?",
  "56266": "Why were they so strangely silent?",
  "56267": "Is it an amusing story?",
  "56268": "You were, were you not?",
  "56269": "Do you find the answer?",
  "56270": "At last she is dead?",
  "56271": "Time to start?",
  "56272": "You understand?",
  "56273": "But how did you know that I was a prisoner back there?",
  "56274": "Wherein?",
  "56275": "Which do you prefer?",
  "56276": "What can be more gratifying than such a retrospect as this?",
  "56277": "What did she say?",
  "56278": "Oh, indeed?",
  "56279": "Besides, which am I to choose?",
  "56280": "Instead, then, of consecrating monopolies from which the holders are to derive no privilege save that of straightway losing, with the income, all the enjoyment thereof, why not decree the agrarian law at once?",
  "56281": "Go to?",
  "56282": "But how could I, a poor dazed village lad, avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best and wisest of men fall every day?",
  "56283": "Well, why not?",
  "56284": "What does it all mean?",
  "56285": "I may assume that there is a second to be mentioned?",
  "56286": "Your father is dead?",
  "56287": "Of whom?",
  "56288": "Natasha, you would not deceive me?",
  "56289": "What were you doing in the battle, my friend?",
  "56290": "But does not this expose himself more than me?",
  "56291": "And is not this the reason why of old love has been called a tyrant?",
  "56292": "What are you doing here?",
  "56293": "Why not take a number of banths and set them loose before us above ground?",
  "56294": "How long did he wear it?",
  "56295": "Is he not a prey which will always be within your grasp?",
  "56296": "What instructing do you think I should do?",
  "56297": "What took her away?",
  "56298": "Yes, how long?",
  "56299": "Is it not the separation of soul and body?",
  "56300": "It is said to have been a congestion of the brain, or apoplexy, which is the same thing, is it not?",
  "56301": "Executions?",
  "56302": "Have commissioned you to tell me what you have just stated?",
  "56303": "Remorse or regret?",
  "56304": "How am I to describe it?",
  "56305": "Tulkinghorn?",
  "56306": "Why are you smiling, prince?",
  "56307": "And if he had not, why did he take her again?",
  "56308": "That is your intention, is it not?",
  "56309": "Will it pass?",
  "56310": "Why did you pick him?",
  "56311": "Do you suppose these stoneless mounds hide no dust of what were men just as good?",
  "56312": "Where are those passionate eyes that appeal'd to my eyes in passion?",
  "56313": "What is it that you say you are going to do?",
  "56314": "What did she send?",
  "56315": "Should he find him at all?",
  "56316": "Why should I meddle?",
  "56317": "The earlier it might be, would it not be better?",
  "56318": "The theories say that, do they?",
  "56319": "And what hope was there that these designs would fail?",
  "56320": "Not from the photos I have showed you?",
  "56321": "Have you ever noticed that the ones we would love the most distractedly are those whom we never meet to know?",
  "56322": "Well, then, my lord, say, are you satisfied?",
  "56323": "Gentlemen, do you stare?",
  "56324": "Well, what do you want?",
  "56325": "Why, monsieur, what secret can you expect to find in the hollow head of a soldier?",
  "56326": "Are you going to return there?",
  "56327": "What need has it of exaggeration?",
  "56328": "What if she loves you now better than anyone?",
  "56329": "Do you happen to know any one in this neighbourhood who would receive him for a while on my paying for him beforehand?",
  "56330": "He has done his best, but what does a fish's best come to when the fish is out of water?",
  "56331": "You are a reactionary, then?",
  "56332": "What's up, anyhow?",
  "56333": "Will there, indeed?",
  "56334": "Who drove you to it?",
  "56335": "We being strangers here, how dare you trust so great a charge from your own custody?",
  "56336": "You are a wheelwright?",
  "56337": "Does that suit you?",
  "56338": "Is anything the matter, aunt?",
  "56339": "And shall we just carelessly allow children to hear any casual tales which may be devised by casual persons, and to receive into their minds ideas for the most part the very opposite of those which we should wish them to have when they are grown up?",
  "56340": "But did be profess any attachment?",
  "56341": "Who are you, madame?",
  "56342": "Did you ever taste beer?",
  "56343": "Boomer?",
  "56344": "Does he mean to say that?",
  "56345": "How much fudder is got for go?",
  "56346": "And when hereafter, for any cause, the people in this place shall desire to find new homes, if they wish to be rid of the institution, where will they find the place to go to?",
  "56347": "And what would their parents think of me, if they saw or heard the children rioting, hatless, bonnetless, gloveless, and bootless, in the deep soft snow?",
  "56348": "Is anyone up in your house?",
  "56349": "Will that suit you?",
  "56350": "Have I not explained your wishes, grandpapa?",
  "56351": "Did you see it?",
  "56352": "And, to be frank, my lord, was I wrong?",
  "56353": "From what?",
  "56354": "Herod?",
  "56355": "Cautious, why so?",
  "56356": "Was it the better to deceive them both?",
  "56357": "Did you tell us?",
  "56358": "Do you understand what you have done to me?",
  "56359": "Nor church?",
  "56360": "Does it end with just our two selves?",
  "56361": "Will there be beds for me and all who seek?",
  "56362": "What virtue will there be then, said the monk, in their bullets of concupiscence, their habits and their bodies?",
  "56363": "How do I know?",
  "56364": "In what direction?",
  "56365": "And of such a man too?",
  "56366": "What good am I here?",
  "56367": "Do you mean what did I say?",
  "56368": "What did the whole world matter to them?",
  "56369": "You feel some pretty well now?",
  "56370": "The man says?",
  "56371": "How should I make a mistake?",
  "56372": "Will you have hash or fishballs for breakfast?",
  "56373": "What signifies?",
  "56374": "Did she mean to go out?",
  "56375": "Where is she?",
  "56376": "Do you know where they came from?",
  "56377": "Did you see him come out on us?",
  "56378": "Why lie awake nights worrying about this?",
  "56379": "And if I did not obey his call, who could answer for what might happen?",
  "56380": "Or worse than the parts they acted require?",
  "56381": "What did you go out for?",
  "56382": "Well, then, what's the sense in wasting the plates?",
  "56383": "Can we not, then, men of common sense, while awaiting the solution which the future will undoubtedly bring forth, prepare ourselves for this great transition by an analysis of the struggling powers, as well as their positive and negative qualities?",
  "56384": "Have you not lately renewed your promise?",
  "56385": "Whose are these beautiful green meadows?",
  "56386": "And why do we set our soul and body, which are such dear companions, at such variance?",
  "56387": "Living together?",
  "56388": "Did you never hear it?",
  "56389": "And what else is paper currency?",
  "56390": "And do you propose to make this journey very shortly?",
  "56391": "But what if fresh disasters should take place?",
  "56392": "Who will say they were not beautiful?",
  "56393": "Is anybody to come and fetch me?",
  "56394": "But when?",
  "56395": "And what explanation is given of the girl's death?",
  "56396": "What was the dreadful thing I dreamed?",
  "56397": "I should think it was a very pleasant life, the married one, eh?",
  "56398": "But what shall we reply to the medals, undoubtedly genuine, which reckon the fifth year of his tribunitian power?",
  "56399": "Have we either of us ever rubbed thumbs over honestly gained farthings?",
  "56400": "Ah, you are the young woman come to look after my birds?",
  "56401": "Why could not I, going up to bed with my basket of keys, stop to sit down by her fire and accommodate myself for a little while to her, at least as well as to anybody else, and not trouble myself about the harmless things she said to me?",
  "56402": "In order, perhaps, to give countenance to the objection at any rate, it may be asked, is there not danger of an opposite bias in the national government, which may dispose it to endeavor to secure a monopoly of the federal administration to the landed class?",
  "56403": "How can we help it?",
  "56404": "Why do you ask such a question, I said, when you ought rather to be answering?",
  "56405": "Would you say six or four years?",
  "56406": "Would you shoot a poor, defenceless girl?",
  "56407": "Which is the duke?",
  "56408": "Now, are you ready?",
  "56409": "Can you write shorthand?",
  "56410": "Yes, why did I not steal?",
  "56411": "Will you say it is because the body is the medium of suffering in this life?",
  "56412": "Now you will be able to go home and tell your friends that you have personally seen and heard the southern lights, for I suppose you have no doubt that you have really done so?",
  "56413": "And are who what?",
  "56414": "You are of my opinion?",
  "56415": "Could it be possible that the squire was going to make a fool of himself and get married?",
  "56416": "But you will?",
  "56417": "How much is it?",
  "56418": "You will permit me to consider him an invalid?",
  "56419": "Where is he concealed?",
  "56420": "But was it his fault?",
  "56421": "You spoke to my coachman, then?",
  "56422": "Was the photograph a cabinet?",
  "56423": "Who's go dar?",
  "56424": "For the commission, is it not my whole future?",
  "56425": "Why all this excitement?",
  "56426": "Do you know the numbers?",
  "56427": "Do you wish you may die if you do know, hey?",
  "56428": "Why then should he repine when the hour of separation arrives?",
  "56429": "She had no reason for walking elsewhere, and why should she not go that way?",
  "56430": "Where is the knave?",
  "56431": "Any news, father?",
  "56432": "When did you see him last?",
  "56433": "Why, pray, did he add the old day?",
  "56434": "You think he went off just by chance?",
  "56435": "Is the cause of my soreness such a mystery that there's any need to tell me I am sore everywhere the staff hit me?",
  "56436": "What be these two, signior?",
  "56437": "Can anyone here play the drum?",
  "56438": "Shall you like to have such a brother?",
  "56439": "And what is better than woman?",
  "56440": "Ye much hurt?",
  "56441": "How shall I ever look this man in the face again?",
  "56442": "Yes?",
  "56443": "You think there may be fighting?",
  "56444": "Could it be that by some neglect in the preparations, the substitution perhaps of the wrong brandy, the astralization could not be effected?",
  "56445": "Was this to her doom after all?",
  "56446": "How agreed?",
  "56447": "And those papers?",
  "56448": "How is the gentleman called?",
  "56449": "What do you mean, you minx?",
  "56450": "What can be done?",
  "56451": "And why are we here?",
  "56452": "Amontillado ?",
  "56453": "A coffin?",
  "56454": "Does it suggest anything to your mind?",
  "56455": "Is the second floor at home?",
  "56456": "Could I forget that last autumn at this same day of the month and at this same place you lighted exactly such a fire as a signal for me to come and see you?",
  "56457": "You are certain?",
  "56458": "Why, did you not hear all we said?",
  "56459": "How, how?",
  "56460": "Is this statement true?",
  "56461": "Then it is my place to ask you what you are going to do about it?",
  "56462": "Why are you up so early, my dear?",
  "56463": "Who will tell her?",
  "56464": "Guilty, of course?",
  "56465": "Do you laugh, you unfeeling brute, as if you enjoyed my distress?",
  "56466": "What enjoyment is there in making love to a woman who belongs to nobody and yet belongs to any one?",
  "56467": "Have you not a word to say to me?",
  "56468": "Two drunken men, eh?",
  "56469": "What need they torture their heads with that which others have taken so strictly and so unalterably into their own purveying?",
  "56470": "What can be more natural and characteristic?",
  "56471": "Is there anything particular?",
  "56472": "What are you upset about?",
  "56473": "But the bogus inspector?",
  "56474": "And where are the children?",
  "56475": "There are then people who inhabit it?",
  "56476": "Her happiness?",
  "56477": "Please, ma'am, could I inquire if this highly instructive and charming institution is a new one?",
  "56478": "Is it not conceivable, at least, that obedience to an unselfish impulse may result even in the sacrifice of the opportunities of moral culture in general?",
  "56479": "But why not?",
  "56480": "How would they address us?",
  "56481": "Is there any thing new in this doctrine?",
  "56482": "What was she to say to him?",
  "56483": "You doubt it then?",
  "56484": "What sense is there in murdering a man in order to define one's relation to a guilty wife and son?",
  "56485": "Then this new kind of knowledge must have an additional quality?",
  "56486": "How do you mean, bold?",
  "56487": "They taught you that?",
  "56488": "But you, critic, the reader undoubtedly will ask, what is your solution?",
  "56489": "But the heat developed by the rapidity of the projectile in crossing the strata of air?",
  "56490": "Well, are you trying to make out that I've said you have?",
  "56491": "Three days ago?",
  "56492": "What is it, a man?",
  "56493": "Whom do you think that is to?",
  "56494": "The lighted window, right up there?",
  "56495": "But if I lose?",
  "56496": "There, who are you?",
  "56497": "Or, perhaps, you may have the precious object she wants in your collection?",
  "56498": "Who do you think should be sent there?",
  "56499": "And what for?",
  "56500": "Should he place his catastrophe as a third associate in their felicity?",
  "56501": "Can you speak, lady?",
  "56502": "Do what?",
  "56503": "That so?",
  "56504": "And you followed the business of a tailor?",
  "56505": "But how did you gain them?",
  "56506": "Whither should they go, and where should be the new seat of the mission?",
  "56507": "How does his apoplex?",
  "56508": "Ca vous amuse, la vie?",
  "56509": "You would throw over one that has stood by you this five years in favour of a man that you never saw before in your life?",
  "56510": "Ceremonies then are a subsequent thing?",
  "56511": "What can be keeping him?",
  "56512": "Why do you laugh, sir?",
  "56513": "Should she speak to her?",
  "56514": "Should she open the door or should she not?",
  "56515": "Now, while you have tyranny in so great a degree walled in, and see your enemies over your heads, to what purpose is it to take counsel?",
  "56516": "You do not know that you love me?",
  "56517": "What in thunder has that to do with you?",
  "56518": "No one at home?",
  "56519": "How is it over?",
  "56520": "Is it business?",
  "56521": "What's a ball through the chest?",
  "56522": "Has he found time to tell you scandal about me?",
  "56523": "Well how can I help it?",
  "56524": "What has our providential rescue to do with altering your feelings toward me?",
  "56525": "Where is it now, the glory and the dream?",
  "56526": "When is one pleasure twice as great as another?",
  "56527": "Is marriage so demoralising as that?",
  "56528": "Did he take any luggage?",
  "56529": "Seeing the old man?",
  "56530": "Was it the effect of the balmy climate alone which recalled him to health?",
  "56531": "Is it paid for?",
  "56532": "Were you speaking of me?",
  "56533": "An emancipator?",
  "56534": "These are the orders, are they?",
  "56535": "Does SHE look like the mother of six?",
  "56536": "Who is the agent?",
  "56537": "What tilbury?",
  "56538": "How can we ever thank you?",
  "56539": "Is it probable?",
  "56540": "Kitchens?",
  "56541": "And then should not the charity be all the more profound, in proportion as the fall is great?",
  "56542": "How was he to get through his present difficulty?",
  "56543": "What have you to say?",
  "56544": "You know?",
  "56545": "Is there any place at liberty that you know of now, uncle, that I should do for?",
  "56546": "But, why should I conceal my sentiments?",
  "56547": "Whom do you mean by THEY?",
  "56548": "Their graces?",
  "56549": "Shall I call him?",
  "56550": "How and why could it be mistaken?",
  "56551": "What the devil do you mean by this?",
  "56552": "If a man in selecting a residence, do not fix on one where such prevail, how can he be wise?",
  "56553": "Well, mon cher, have you got the manifesto?",
  "56554": "How, you are going soon?",
  "56555": "So saying, he fixed his eyes upon me, and asked if I had seen him tremble?",
  "56556": "But the man who was under him?",
  "56557": "Did he still cherish hope?",
  "56558": "Why funny?",
  "56559": "What have I done?",
  "56560": "Do you know much of him?",
  "56561": "Are you quite ready, gentlemen?",
  "56562": "To get what's left me sold by auction?",
  "56563": "What is to be done in these circumstances?",
  "56564": "Could he be sure that he was not their accomplice?",
  "56565": "Did the people shout at all?",
  "56566": "Excuse me,' and you believe that is sufficient?",
  "56567": "I daresay you've heard of her?",
  "56568": "Perhaps you'd care to come in and have a drink on your way?",
  "56569": "Must I receive it, or leave it in the hands of the notary?",
  "56570": "What is the meaning of that?",
  "56571": "Oh, you know him?",
  "56572": "Sir, have you finished supper?",
  "56573": "What did I get by that?",
  "56574": "What has become of the faith which has hitherto carried you so bravely through all our difficulties?",
  "56575": "Then what will you have me say?",
  "56576": "Missus's?",
  "56577": "How, then, am I mad?",
  "56578": "Could you possibly wish for a more favorable conjunction of circumstances?",
  "56579": "How should I know?",

  "56583": "Why should I die, then, or basely despair?",
  "56584": "And anyone else?",
  "56585": "And what did he tell 'ee next?",
  "56586": "Do you never feel sick of it?",
  "56587": "Was this precaution or humility?",
  "56588": "Any men on it?",
  "56589": "Was it possible they heard not?",
  "56590": "Why do men halt between two opinions, and expect impossibilities?",
  "56591": "What are you wanting?",
  "56592": "Will not the good people respond to a united and earnest appeal from us?",
  "56593": "But why should I not receive her?",
  "56594": "But from whom is that letter?",
  "56595": "Have you them?",
  "56596": "What, gentlemen, is your verdict?",
  "56597": "What's a tall man unless he fight?",
  "56598": "Did that person not come back, then?",
  "56599": "Was there any other spirit but rum in the room?",
  "56600": "Do you wish to know clearly celestial matters, what they rightly are?",
  "56601": "Heavily?",
  "56602": "Do you want me to tear out my hair in handfuls?",
  "56603": "If the officer be accused of dishonesty, how shall it be made out?",
  "56604": "Where is the cure?",
  "56605": "Are you on the ground?",
  "56606": "You mentioned a fowl, I think?",
  "56607": "Upon what?",
  "56608": "Is not this an extraordinary tale?",
  "56609": "What are you meddling with my deeds for?",
  "56610": "Who is it, then, that you want to see?",
  "56611": "Is it to be yes at last?",
  "56612": "What made you think she would be here?",
  "56613": "WHO is in the room?",
  "56614": "What was there to be seen there?",
  "56615": "Was there left now nothing but to break off from the happy creative being, was the time up?",
  "56616": "You are not going out, uncle?",
  "56617": "What does it matter where it comes from?",
  "56618": "You are determined, then, to push your fortune in other lands?",
  "56619": "Why should I be ashamed of myself?",
  "56620": "And there are four of you?",
  "56621": "How will it do, how will it do?",
  "56622": "Did you see the libraries and schools!?",
  "56623": "I should like to know whether you have the same notion which I have of this study?",

  "56635": "Then why on earth does she do it?",
  "56636": "How could this be, sir?",
  "56637": "Shall I tell you why?",
  "56638": "What is the day of the month?",
  "56639": "What shall become of me?",
  "56640": "Well, have you made up your mind to this journey?",
  "56641": "And him you found?",
  "56642": "Did he get his brain fever, and then write all those terrible things, or had he some cause for it all?",
  "56643": "Was she young?",
  "56644": "Cosette?",
  "56645": "Have you seen?",
  "56646": "Where shall we go?",
  "56647": "Or what is this?",

  "56650": "But how should they know when the projectile had reached this neutral point situated at that distance, especially when neither themselves, nor the objects enclosed in the projectile, would be any longer subject to the laws of weight?",
  "56651": "What have you been doing during my absence?",
  "56652": "To you, eh?",
  "56653": "But can the musician by his art make men unmusical?",
  "56654": "Yet, when the sensibility is thus increased at the expense of reason, and even the imagination, why do philosophical men complain of their fickleness?",
  "56655": "Am I to suppose that you intend to lower yourself by marrying a young woman who cannot possibly have enjoyed any of the advantages of a lady's education?",
  "56656": "Well, and your guardian must be brave if he is to fight well?",
  "56657": "Has my girl any objection?",
  "56658": "Now, when the restriction is removed, what is to prevent it from going still farther?",
  "56659": "But, I say, do you make any progress in it?",
  "56660": "But who should less expect from you?",
  "56661": "I would have you consider seriously of it?",
  "56662": "And what money 'ud he want?",
  "56663": "What would you have, sir?",
  "56664": "Were they asleep?",
  "56665": "Yet if he is not the maker, what is he in relation to the bed?",
  "56666": "Of complexion and brown hair?",
  "56667": "Have they contributed to encourage the diligence, and to improve the abilities, of the teachers?",
  "56668": "What about marriage?",
  "56669": "My friend, whom, then, will you serve?",
  "56670": "How is it that justice and isolation always accompany each other?",
  "56671": "And how is it to be parried?",
  "56672": "The rabbit?",
  "56673": "What could he have wanted there?",
  "56674": "Rob?",
  "56675": "So there is a hole?",
  "56676": "Why pay rent?",
  "56677": "Should he try to catch her eye, and then raise his hat?",
  "56678": "The first question is, whether music is or is not to make a part of education?",
  "56679": "Will you do me the favor to explain this enigma to me?",
  "56680": "Is there any other point which you would like to ask about?",
  "56681": "The bed might have been let down by some artificial means?",
  "56682": "But what are you up to?",
  "56683": "But what about you, and the rowing?",
  "56684": "May I have a grill for dinner?",
  "56685": "What need he add to such a desperate proof in figures?",
  "56686": "Did you promise to marry her?",
  "56687": "Did you speculate any more?",
  "56688": "What, let me ask, is a man in and of himself?",
  "56689": "Why so much beating about the bush?",
  "56690": "Or am I not to know?",
  "56691": "What does your chamber open on?",
  "56692": "Come to where four roads meet?",
  "56693": "What's this round your neck?",
  "56694": "And which?",
  "56695": "Why do you want to do that at this particular time, when at every previous time that I have proposed it you have refused?",
  "56696": "What gallows?",
  "56697": "Do you think you can help me, dear grandpapa?",
  "56698": "Why do you sit out here all alone?",
  "56699": "O why was that so?",
  "56700": "You know what they say of my lodger?",
  "56701": "But if he gives you?",
  "56702": "What money is this?",
  "56703": "And would it be indiscreet to ask you the name of this powerful protector?",
  "56704": "I beg your pardon?",
  "56705": "What do you call liberty, monsieur?",
  "56706": "You'll mention that I called, perhaps?",
  "56707": "You notice my ring?",
  "56708": "What revenge?",
  "56709": "What say ye?",
  "56710": "Against your father?",
  "56711": "Is it all right in the new way?",
  "56712": "Are those horrid creatures gone?",
  "56713": "Why does he then exceed all bounds at once?",
  "56714": "How are you sure?",
  "56715": "Does any one live, who knows what set purposes you have, half as well as I do?",
  "56716": "Could it be that these were four words, and that they were intended to carry a message to me?",
  "56717": "There is nothing you desire?",
  "56718": "Will you let me make the tea?",
  "56719": "What else did he say to you?",
  "56720": "What is there in all that for me to think about?",
  "56721": "By pulling out a bar and pushing down a door?",
  "56722": "Aye?",
  "56723": "Well, miss?",
  "56724": "But what was to be done?",
  "56725": "Was the projectile under some foreign influence?",
  "56726": "Will you begin, if you please, and put in the thatch again, just as if you were doing it for your mother's cabin?",
  "56727": "Shall we not set forth?",
  "56728": "Do you, sir?",
  "56729": "Do you think this does?",
  "56730": "Do you think you could hustle something in the way of a little lunch, old man?",
  "56731": "What could this NN be?",
  "56732": "And how did he behave, madam?",
  "56733": "How much do you require for my ransom?",
  "56734": "If the possibility of passing the limits of experience be admitted, by means of the dynamical law of the relation of an effect to its cause, what kind of conception shall we obtain by this procedure?",
  "56735": "But are your relatives so very poor?",
  "56736": "What is all this dancing up and down?",
  "56737": "If all were only vanity, who would mind it?",
  "56738": "Would I not give my life to secure it?",
  "56739": "But will his warriors consent?",
  "56740": "Why then should you expect me to pen this kind of affidavit, which has no object but to keep up a foolish partiality and secure a foolish bequest?",
  "56741": "But how did you proceed?",
  "56742": "What was it placed there for?",
  "56743": "Are YOU there?",
  "56744": "Or perhaps it is the pale morning light which takes your colour away?",
  "56745": "Why did you not bring it at once?",
  "56746": "The messenger that brought it, said would you be so good as read it by my lantern?",
  "56747": "If anyone arrives in my absence, do the honors for me, will you not?",
  "56748": "Has the breakfast been all right?",
  "56749": "Of what day?",
  "56750": "Has anyone?",
  "56751": "I trust you are in good health, and that your families are all well?",
  "56752": "Was it the fall of some mighty pillar of the globe?",
  "56753": "Well, what now?",
  "56754": "Think?",
  "56755": "And the youth repented, and became a good man?",
  "56756": "He rends defenseless women and little children in his lair, but how recently has one of you seen him fight with men?",
  "56757": "Pray, what may that portmanteau of yours weigh?",
  "56758": "You'll be sure to be stirring early and go with us?",
  "56759": "Will it be possible to draw water here tonight?",
  "56760": "Are any of the gallants within?",
  "56761": "Well, then, what do you make of your word AUSTRA?",
  "56762": "Where does the fun come in?",
  "56763": "Why not defend ourselves?",
  "56764": "Is the atmospheric condition, having once reached this density, to become final?",
  "56765": "Has he fallen into a lethargy, or is he dead?",
  "56766": "Could they go to the corral in this dark night?",
  "56767": "Should he treat it as belonging to him?",
  "56768": "Will he succeed in his purpose?",
  "56769": "Oh, how could you act so?",
  "56770": "And yet, he said, the number two is certainly not opposed to the number three?",
  "56771": "No lands neither?",
  "56772": "What were horses made for, if not to drag people uphill?",
  "56773": "In which of your characters, sir, will you give us leave to address you?",
  "56774": "Why have you thrown that away?",
  "56775": "Dead?",
  "56776": "Will you never correct yourself of that vile habit?",
  "56777": "And what did you think, sir, of what I said?",
  "56778": "What, then, it may be asked, is the good of being great?",
  "56779": "Is it not clear that your duty is to oppose the former to the latter, and thus, by the argument of contradiction, drive privilege into its last ditch?",
  "56780": "I wonder which craft I shall get?",
  "56781": "You promise?",
  "56782": "Not so much as out of bed?",
  "56783": "What's the good of tormenting him like this?",
  "56784": "What do you think of that?",
  "56785": "Can you not do anything you wish?",
  "56786": "But how were you to benefit?",
  "56787": "Rinaldo, why still so pensive?",
  "56788": "What can I do for you?",
  "56789": "What have I done to need his forgiveness?",
  "56790": "And whom I so dearly love?",
  "56791": "Only compatible with letting ME, you mean?",
  "56792": "If so, is he mad?",
  "56793": "Do we eulogize the man who first perceives the dawn?",
  "56794": "Is she one of the performers?",
  "56795": "What rights does your majesty attach to this office of intendant?",
  "56796": "Money, I presume?",
  "56797": "In your arms?",
  "56798": "Pray to what is this attributable?",
  "56799": "How can it be otherwise with me?",
  "56800": "Peace?",
  "56801": "What work are you about now?",
  "56802": "Would not his hearers add to that sum?",
  "56803": "But passion for him?",
  "56804": "Who is he?",
  "56805": "Does your feminine tyranny require that when you say the thing you mean is one of several things, I should know it immediately by that mark?",
  "56806": "In what condition of mind were you?",
  "56807": "Is it like that, dad?",
  "56808": "And how the devil did you come to fasten me out, you toothless hound?",
  "56809": "Spell it?",
  "56810": "How did I give it?",
  "56811": "What do you want with twenty sons?",
  "56812": "Where can I turn?",
  "56813": "Well, then, what kind o' brothers would it be that 'd stand in his way at sech a time?",
  "56814": "We are blocked up then?",
  "56815": "The question in such cases is, whose is the heavier punishment, hers or his?",
  "56816": "And where are the rest of his banditti?",
  "56817": "What is the nature of the impediment?",
  "56818": "Oh, the admirable police have found that out, have they?",
  "56819": "Can I see him?",
  "56820": "What are they, he said, and where shall I find them?",
  "56821": "Where is it?",
  "56822": "But what is the use?",
  "56823": "Why not jine hands and forgit it?",
  "56824": "Which way lies their path?",
  "56825": "Are you engaged to that painter?",
  "56826": "I've convinced you it's impossible?",
  "56827": "Is it to lead us prisoners to the woods, or do you contemplate even some greater evil?",
  "56828": "Did not I work that waistcoat to make you genteel?",
  "56829": "And why is it impossible?",
  "56830": "What became of these men?",
  "56831": "Shall we shut the door, and lock it, or not?",
  "56832": "Why should you ever have been otherwise?",
  "56833": "Sparsit?",
  "56834": "When did you ever hear of me starving people into good behavior?",
  "56835": "It was you who sent for me?",
  "56836": "Is he going to deceive a SHIP CLERK?",
  "56837": "Has he any friends?",
  "56838": "Then can the convicts have been on board?",
  "56839": "Or that they were not the first statues?",
  "56840": "Rascal, what are you at there?",
  "56841": "Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?",
  "56842": "Not drawn towards drink, eh?",
  "56843": "Who then is the monarch, or where is the monarchy?",
  "56844": "Gridley?",
  "56845": "How did this happen?",
  "56846": "And when she is undeceived?",
  "56847": "How so?",
  "56848": "Now, come and tell me whether the horns of your other knights of the bull's feather have such a virtue and wonderful propriety?",
  "56849": "Who dares maintain such a proposition?",
  "56850": "And would you care to view the remains?",
  "56851": "Do you smoke?",
  "56852": "Will you disgrace me thus?",
  "56853": "Be sure you sense what I say?",
  "56854": "Do you ever feel weary?",
  "56855": "Are you an orphan?",
  "56856": "Want any more?",
  "56857": "You have not observed anyone follow or watch you?",
  "56858": "How should I disengage myself?",

  "56862": "Will you have it?",
  "56863": "But how do you know you will get the money back?",
  "56864": "What does it say?",
  "56865": "Who was that with you?",
  "56866": "A propos, have you a good horse?",
  "56867": "Well, now, and the short and long of it, captain?",
  "56868": "Very well?",

  "56872": "Prussians in the cellar?",
  "56873": "But who made it so as there was no arbitratin', and no justice to be got?",
  "56874": "What have you in common with him?",
  "56875": "Can the mercy which they have exercised even in the fury of battle be extinct in their hearts?",
  "56876": "Now shall we go home?",
  "56877": "A scandal, is it not?",
  "56878": "Will you come?",
  "56879": "What strength or courage could avail against an enemy armed with such mysterious powers?",
  "56880": "Where are we then?",
  "56881": "And why are you lacking ties?",
  "56882": "Aye?",
  "56883": "Is that the exact substance?",
  "56884": "They have no bread?",
  "56885": "For is not the heart placed in the breast just like a lighted candle which is set in a lantern?",
  "56886": "What promise of future reward have you made me for all the submission and obedience I have evinced?",
  "56887": "But how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house?",
  "56888": "Do the servants sleep in these rooms?",
  "56889": "How was I to return?",
  "56890": "You're not going to leave me?",
  "56891": "Is it time?",
  "56892": "What he meant to do with it, and whether he were mad?",
  "56893": "But, hullo, who's the visitor?",
  "56894": "How had she lost it?",
  "56895": "Have you any one to go on your bond?",
  "56896": "What joy is that?",
  "56897": "Something to soften down that harsh judgment?",
  "56898": "At all events tell me whether he slept at home last night, and whether he came alone?",
  "56899": "Then you will start after the queen?",
  "56900": "And was it a lie that you told me?",
  "56901": "Was it because I hate you and have hated you all my life?",
  "56902": "Is it a demon?",
  "56903": "I hope you like them?",
  "56904": "Afraid?",
  "56905": "Are we going to be friends after this?",
  "56906": "Well, what shall we do, darling?",
  "56907": "Never could discover?",
  "56908": "What rest?",
  "56909": "What matter, madam?",
  "56910": "Can such, by any human ingenuity, be moulded into anything resembling an orderly community?",
  "56911": "Was that all?",
  "56912": "And should anyone in any case be content that his oath shall go unkept on a merely unsubstantial controversy as to how it shall be kept?",
  "56913": "What good would that do?",
  "56914": "Have you another passenger?",
  "56915": "What made 'ee ask that?",
  "56916": "For what period of time?",
  "56917": "What would become of me if I should do such a thing?",
  "56918": "When once in the bay, would she anchor there?",
  "56919": "And how, lower down still?",
  "56920": "What fine chisel could ever yet cut breath?",
  "56921": "Ah, why were you not there, gentlemen?",
  "56922": "What are you gaping at?",
  "56923": "Have another?",
  "56924": "Wherein is a victory more valuable by your plan than mine?",
  "56925": "Where do you get your money?",
  "56926": "At this dingle dangle wagging of my tub, what would you have me to do?",
  "56927": "What would the boys say if they could see us?",
  "56928": "Nothing else smart?",
  "56929": "What is yours?",
  "56930": "Now, then, you want to warn me?",
  "56931": "If atoms are indivisible and impenetrable, why does not their association, confined to mechanical effects, leave them unchanged in essence?",
  "56932": "Will you be good enough to follow us?",
  "56933": "But what are you doing?",
  "56934": "I believe it was settled you should meet me?",
  "56935": "Then, what clue could you have as to his identity?",
  "56936": "Any you will submit to the reparation he may require?",
  "56937": "Why did you signal to stop?",
  "56938": "And when you used to tell the stories?",
  "56939": "You saw that?",
  "56940": "Do you pretend you had any right to make professions of love to her, even if you had been a fit husband for her, when neither her father nor your father would ever consent to a marriage between you?",
  "56941": "What's this I see?",
  "56942": "And you will not be annoyed if I tell you the plain truth?",
  "56943": "And how much do you suppose that he understood of it?",
  "56944": "And things great and small, heavy and light, as they are termed, will not be denoted by these any more than by the opposite names?",
  "56945": "Come, shall we turn round?",
  "56946": "Did the cavern which the settlers were now exploring extend to the center of the island?",
  "56947": "Do you mean because we're in my wife's brougham?",
  "56948": "Is that how you look after things?",
  "56949": "What had become of her?",
  "56950": "To this I am willing, but is there none amongst us who has a better right?",
  "56951": "First floor?",
  "56952": "Then, what, sir, if I should convince you to your face of my sincerity?",
  "56953": "Why, what shall I learn?",
  "56954": "But what's to be done?",
  "56955": "And how is my father?",
  "56956": "Ah?",
  "56957": "And, to conclude the matter, what is even an eternal remembrance?",
  "56958": "Could I be mistaken?",
  "56959": "But why, sir?",
  "56960": "And what his cause of grief?",
  "56961": "Is it so?",
  "56962": "Do they, sir?",
  "56963": "Why should you be thus scrupulous, pray you, sir?",
  "56964": "Then, sire, may I present him?",
  "56965": "Yes, giant's horses you must have, must you not?",
  "56966": "Have we come to any?",
  "56967": "What do you assure me?",
  "56968": "Do you believe in spiritualism?",
  "56969": "And wherefore do you hate him?",
  "56970": "What is imagination?",
  "56971": "Nay, none?",
  "56972": "Where does the window of that look out to?",
  "56973": "And sack my stable?",
  "56974": "Like what, sir, eh?",
  "56975": "Could she still draw back after all he had done for her?",

  "57358": "How can you talk so?",
  "57359": "Who told you that they have never done so?",
  "57360": "Have you got a sledge?",
  "57361": "Police, sir?",
  "57362": "But come whither?",
  "57363": "Then I have received a merely legitimate salary, in spite of the opinion of my confessor?",
  "57364": "But where was the novelty?",
  "57365": "Where is your wife, in the first place?",
  "57366": "And where did the dream come from?",
  "57367": "And what shall I do if you desert me?",
  "57368": "How, nowhere?",
  "57369": "Do you know what we are eating here?",
  "57370": "Yes, but how much?",
  "57371": "Grow pale, fear, calculate?",
  "57372": "Go on the stage?",
  "57373": "Wood?",
  "57374": "What are my heart's experiences?",
  "57375": "What is the ego?",
  "57376": "And how much did she give you for this fine enterprise?",
  "57377": "Was there no means of calming this angry sea?",
  "57378": "What did he say to that?",
  "57379": "Do about you?",
  "57380": "What's the sense of it?",
  "57381": "Where is the guilty party here?",
  "57382": "And what happened to him afterwards?",
  "57383": "Is it a duty to postpone everything to a sense of injuries, and wrong to gratify a mother in a request like this?",
  "57384": "What will you do?",
  "57385": "Anything else, my lord?",
  "57386": "Dear mother, are you so resolved?",
  "57387": "But she is proud, is she not?",
  "57388": "But what does the thermometer say?",
  "57389": "Can you ask that question?",
  "57390": "What's become of them, the dear fellows?",
  "57391": "Why are you travelling?",
  "57392": "How should they use it?",
  "57393": "Does he speak to you of this conspiracy?",
  "57394": "And was SHE married?",
  "57395": "You left your door open?",
  "57396": "Is there danger of another?",
  "57397": "What had her infancy been?",
  "57398": "How much money have you left?",
  "57399": "What is the matter?",
  "57400": "But what were you going to say?",
  "57401": "She is no relation of his?",
  "57402": "What hard fortune brought us here?",
  "57403": "What if she were so called?",
  "57404": "In other words, should strict impartiality be aimed at?",
  "57405": "And what did he offer?",
  "57406": "Why not go and try to get speech of him and beg for justice?",
  "57407": "What shall you do in life?",
  "57408": "Was not that nearly what you said?",
  "57409": "Is not this a free country?",
  "57410": "Which of these will be mine?",
  "57411": "How did you happen to be taken to a hospital?",
  "57412": "What is it?",
  "57413": "I brought it to the table near the fire, and asked him what he would have?",
  "57414": "Do you remember what you told me once, about her making all the apple parsties and doing all the cooking?",
  "57415": "Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind?",
  "57416": "Does this prove that ignorance and dependence domesticate them?",
  "57417": "Why do you not see this?",
  "57418": "What is it makes the wolves to leave the woods?",
  "57419": "It is useless?",
  "57420": "Mad, is he?",
  "57421": "Is it a pure a priori, or is it an empirical intuition?",
  "57422": "Why does it not encourage its citizens to put out its faults, and do better than it would have them?",
  "57423": "Have you told them where to find me?",
  "57424": "Where, then, is the ship?",
  "57425": "I'm not very exacting, am I?",
  "57426": "And in what state of mind has he returned to you?",
  "57427": "What was it that he did?",
  "57428": "Well, then, tell us frankly, what do you think of her personal appearance?",
  "57429": "Why, for example, should the king of a primitive community be prohibited from sleeping lying down?",
  "57430": "Where am I to join on?",
  "57431": "What right have you to bid me leave this house, sir?",
  "57432": "Who would endure this for many lives?",
  "57433": "Which is best off?",
  "57434": "Tell me, where is the place that men call hell?",
  "57435": "Then will she die too?",
  "57436": "Need it be said that no such measures could destroy that tendency?",
  "57437": "Well as he knew how to resolve characters into their elements, would he have been able to combine those elements in such a manner as to make up a man, a real, living, individual man?",
  "57438": "Od's precious, come away, man, what do you mean?",
  "57439": "May I go and help carry the things to the poor little children?",
  "57440": "Have heard them say that there is nothing pleasanter than to get rid of their pain?",
  "57441": "Who could see?",
  "57442": "Have you any more to stake?",
  "57443": "What shall you tell her?",
  "57444": "What like is he?",
  "57445": "Is this of envy or no?",
  "57446": "Why, WHY do they torment me and say I am going to marry you?",
  "57447": "If I went to sleep as I proposed, how could the atmosphere in the chamber be regenerated in the interim?",
  "57448": "I suppose you have searched her desk and things?",
  "57449": "What, after all, was this new oath?",
  "57450": "What then are we to conclude from these facts and considerations?",
  "57451": "How might it fare more gently with you in all the world?",
  "57452": "What avarice?",
  "57453": "Hurt me?",
  "57454": "Who's not playing fair?",
  "57455": "They were none of them among our friends at the lodge, then?",
  "57456": "Has it been so kept?",
  "57457": "So you are going away in the fall?",
  "57458": "In the flesh?",
  "57459": "Where is my wife?",
  "57460": "And had he married the valiant matron's daughter, as he promised?",
  "57461": "Whatcher take me for, hey?",
  "57462": "What do you mean, the rabbit?",
  "57463": "Now what do you say?",
  "57464": "And what sort of men do they graduate?",
  "57465": "He knew then?",
  "57466": "What was she insolent about?",
  "57467": "Do you not see his heart is fast breaking?",
  "57468": "Can this be possible, uncle?",
  "57469": "Why should they?",
  "57470": "Have you forgotten the day?",
  "57471": "Do you see anything there?",
  "57472": "What is the object of this assembly?",
  "57473": "Good heavens, are you ill?",
  "57474": "Well, did you dig up the watch?",
  "57475": "You will arrest him?",
  "57476": "What uncanny secret did it hold?",
  "57477": "Why is she thus possessed, and why does she not spare herself?",
  "57478": "At any rate, you have some walks in the neighbourhood?",
  "57479": "You have been a soldier?",
  "57480": "But why a year?",
  "57481": "Who's that laughing at me?",
  "57482": "Where, then, would have been her navy, her trade and even her existence?",
  "57483": "What do you hear from your mother?",
  "57484": "How could I settle the point forever?",
  "57485": "What does that spell?",
  "57486": "He means to marry you?",
  "57487": "But would that be necessary?",
  "57488": "What did happen?",
  "57489": "Is the shepherd said to be just to his sheep and his dogs?",
  "57490": "Why do you keep the secrets of that man, when they mean death to so many?",
  "57491": "But if I pursue and nothing gain, what will it profit me to come up with him?",
  "57492": "Do you wish to get out?",
  "57493": "Clara, are you ready to come home?",
  "57494": "Did you ever hear of such ingratitude?",
  "57495": "The best school?",
  "57496": "Bread?",
  "57497": "Dare they to hope a poet for their friend?",
  "57498": "What do I deduce from this?",
  "57499": "When did that person come here, waiter?",
  "57500": "What has made you so disobedient and unfaithful?",
  "57501": "You're not in bed?",
  "57502": "What spot?",
  "57503": "What would become of this assertion, if, assuming in my turn the offensive, I should demonstrate that belief in the existence of bodies, or, in other words, in the reality of a purely corporeal nature, is untenable?",
  "57504": "Did he believe?",
  "57505": "And now, is this all you have to tell me?",
  "57506": "Could he forego the renown of being the first wit of his age?",
  "57507": "What was he hoping for?",
  "57508": "What name am I to say?",
  "57509": "Elm or fir, both of which abounded in the island?",
  "57510": "And why will they not?",
  "57511": "A new one?",
  "57512": "What if you should die first?",
  "57513": "As day by day the sun sank lower and lower in the sky, could he be certain that the luminary would ever retrace his heavenly road?",
  "57514": "Had they nothing else to say to one another?",
  "57515": "Who told you to steal?",
  "57516": "Did I not tell you how quick and resolute she was?",
  "57517": "Is there any example of an individual object that escaped the government of that law in the whole history of the world?",
  "57518": "Why tarry ye?",
  "57519": "Did he give a reason?",
  "57520": "How did you come here?",
  "57521": "Did I break through one of your rings, that you spread that damned ice on the causeway?",
  "57522": "He asked himself, or were they playing a part?",
  "57523": "Is it true that my mind is only a harmony, and my soul a vortex?",
  "57524": "But if I do fight, you will surely not object to giving me a lesson or two in shooting and fencing?",
  "57525": "Are we women?",
  "57526": "Have you more to say?",
  "57527": "What had really happened?",
  "57528": "For what is there more prompt, more unexpected, more abbreviatory of space and time, than the maturity of an obligation?",
  "57529": "Would they be right in the future?",
  "57530": "And what do you say is your surmise as to your present position?",
  "57531": "Suppose now I ask, why I rather than anybody else?",
  "57532": "If what?",
  "57533": "Have you a heart?",
  "57534": "With me?",
  "57535": "Did you ever hear of such an idea?",
  "57536": "Have you quite forgotten her?",
  "57537": "So you are good enough to pass my appearance?",
  "57538": "Is it tobacco?",
  "57539": "I ask you what can I do?",
  "57540": "Could it have been an early hornet?",
  "57541": "Who is that?",
  "57542": "Can you drink anything?",
  "57543": "Why not pursue an end confessedly good by peaceable and regular means?",
  "57544": "Did he come to arrest me?",
  "57545": "Whither so fast, child?",
  "57546": "Ah, why will you not unseal my lips?",
  "57547": "Does this look like confidence?",
  "57548": "Has it gone well?",
  "57549": "Admires the jay the insect's gilded wings?",
  "57550": "And did they often get a chance to do that?",
  "57551": "And do I love?",
  "57552": "UNDER THE CROSS,' hey?",
  "57553": "What did you look at, so fixedly?",
  "57554": "Why stop?",
  "57555": "And of what are you so sure?",
  "57556": "And the friend he regards and describes as one in whom he has an interest, and the other as a stranger in whom he has no interest?",
  "57557": "For all that, are not our dresses as beautiful as yours?",
  "57558": "Why are they fighting?",
  "57559": "Is the danger you apprehended last night gone by now, sir?",
  "57560": "When the winds blow and the seas flow?",
  "57561": "Do you call this acting the part of a man and a gentleman, sir?",
  "57562": "Why should not I eat birds?",
  "57563": "A slap in the face?",
  "57564": "What have you to do with our independence?",
  "57565": "Are you sure you can get 'em out of their fix?",
  "57566": "What principle directed it?",
  "57567": "Besides, why should I say anything about it to him?",
  "57568": "How did you get this passport?",
  "57569": "The house is sold, then?",
  "57570": "What kind of person is she?",
  "57571": "Did he hear me?",
  "57572": "You were his constant companion, then?",
  "57573": "Is it not rather an appeal to the proprietory instinct, the COMMERCIAL instinct?",
  "57574": "Is that true, mother?",
  "57575": "How once?",
  "57576": "When an establishment has had the leisure to develop itself, enlarge its foundations, ballast itself with capital, and assure itself a body of patrons, what can the workman who has only his arms do against a power so superior?",
  "57577": "Well, and what does it signify whether it was he or I?",
  "57578": "What formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward?",
  "57579": "Would it be believed, that when near nineteen, any one could be so stupid as to build his hopes of future subsistence on an empty phial?",
  "57580": "For what?",
  "57581": "Is not this absurd?",
  "57582": "Do you know that I am to be beheaded outside this window?",
  "57583": "Eh, who's there?",
  "57584": "How many a year, did you say?",
  "57585": "You intend to show off your intelligence, I suppose?",
  "57586": "Did you want me?",
  "57587": "What are you talking about, man?",
  "57588": "Is it possible that even now, when I give you these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?",
  "57589": "But where were you going, when you met us?",
  "57590": "D'Artagnan?",
  "57591": "I wonder where I shall be this time tomorrow?",
  "57592": "Taenarum?",
  "57593": "Cannot you understand that the time it takes to wink is a whole eternity if it severs me from the beauty of your face?",
  "57594": "Tomorrow, then, sire?",
  "57595": "And who are you?",
  "57596": "What did ye?",
  "57597": "Did you put out the lamp?",
  "57598": "How long would it last?",
  "57599": "Who is still to come?",
  "57600": "Should he abandon this man?",
  "57601": "How about the others?",
  "57602": "Has he brought his brig with him?",
  "57603": "And what are my instructions?",
  "57604": "To make that reply and then perish, what could be grander?",
  "57605": "Why do I?",
  "57606": "Where are we living?",
  "57607": "Would you like me to come with you now?",
  "57608": "Can you already understand?",
  "57609": "Were they in the front or in the rear of their generation?",
  "57610": "How could I be otherwise?",
  "57611": "On the contrary, but what dignity?",
  "57612": "Just now, but refrained out of politeness ?",
  "57613": "Are you trying to hide?",
  "57614": "Is the vicar in?",
  "57615": "How can you say such a thing?",
  "57616": "A secret?",
  "57617": "Did you want the carpenter, sir?",
  "57618": "Then why are you always alone in your room these days?",
  "57619": "Got shot?",
  "57620": "Who makes the waters flow?",
  "57621": "More money, I suppose?",
  "57622": "About you?",
  "57623": "You will be staying on here, I suppose?",
  "57624": "It is you who set out seven or eight months ago from your country to seek your fortune in the capital?",
  "57625": "Where's your uncle?",
  "57626": "Who in the world cares for YOU?",
  "57627": "Was it real, or only apparent?",
  "57628": "What is the difficulty?",
  "57629": "WHAT doth all the world know at present?",
  "57630": "Is there no ford?",
  "57631": "How came it to pass?",
  "57632": "Are you willing?",
  "57633": "Done with their buttons?",
  "57634": "Av you anything to say agen it?",
  "57635": "Could it have been a slight quivering of the nostrils that he had seen, or was it mad fancy playing a trick on him?",
  "57636": "Would it comfort, or would it wound you to have a similar painting?",
  "57637": "Who is in command here?",
  "57638": "Will you let me see you home?",
  "57639": "Will you take charge of the letter?",
  "57640": "Should not all that be eternal?",
  "57641": "But why prove that to me?",
  "57642": "And its aim is?",
  "57643": "What could be the meaning of such a change?",
  "57644": "Have there been any fresh developments?",
  "57645": "What are you about?",
  "57646": "I am to live at home?",
  "57647": "What joy would they have to bring hanging to the likes of me?",
  "57648": "Where did she go?",
  "57649": "But may I, mamma?",
  "57650": "And who are hearsed that die on the sea?",
  "57651": "How have you got here?",
  "57652": "How long has he left it?",
  "57653": "And whither am I to go?",
  "57654": "Now, from whom could these pages come?",
  "57655": "You will then be at my service?",
  "57656": "And pray, sir, what in the world is equal to it?",
  "57657": "Could it be that there should be happiness in store for her?",
  "57658": "And what would that be, think you?",
  "57659": "In whose name do you come?",
  "57660": "Why not have let me speak to you, above there, where it is light, and there is something stirring, instead of bringing us to this dark and dismal hole?",
  "57661": "Where is my hat?",
  "57662": "But we'll gie 'em another song?",
  "57663": "Yet could I, in justice, or even in possibility, refuse this demand?",
  "57664": "What is the meaning of this?",
  "57665": "Will your majesty permit me to tell you the truth?",
  "57666": "Whatever can be the matter?",
  "57667": "Had the cooling of the globe produced it?",
  "57668": "Are you and your party ready?",
  "57669": "Doubt?",
  "57670": "To whom do I surrender?",
  "57671": "Why, where have you seen her?",
  "57672": "Where have you hid him?",
  "57673": "Well, are you off to the front?",
  "57674": "Oh, is that so?",
  "57675": "Why should we give it?",
  "57676": "He asked me if I felt sure that I was as well as in the morning?",
  "57677": "Please will your grandfather lend us his fuelhouse to try over our parts in, tonight at seven o'clock?",
  "57678": "Well, what is it perplexes me?",
  "57679": "Is your honour mad?",
  "57680": "This dial with movable needle is a manometer, is it not?",
  "57681": "How could these men, who never had the faintest idea of statistics, valuation, or political economy, furnish us with principles of legislation?",
  "57682": "And how's it you're not afraid, sir, really now?",
  "57683": "This?",
  "57684": "Are you going to walk out with us after lunch?",
  "57685": "Have you been in it since your adventure?",
  "57686": "Wife with you?",
  "57687": "Why do you keep looking at me like that?",
  "57688": "Did he reject her eternally, or did he not?",
  "57689": "Will you not honor us by telling us who you are?",
  "57690": "Whom have you come from?",
  "57691": "Have you noticed these flowers?",
  "57692": "How much brandy may I drink?",
  "57693": "But what does it matter, now it's all over?",
  "57694": "Who will bring up my children?",
  "57695": "But why should we wish to escape?",
  "57696": "Tell her?",
  "57697": "Has he no father or mother, or uncles or aunts?",
  "57698": "Interested, are you?",
  "57699": "If I'm as good as good can be all day tomorrow will you let me be just as bad as I like all the next day?",
  "57700": "For the father's?",
  "57701": "You're not turning your head to look after more moths, are you?",
  "57702": "And what more do you see?",
  "57703": "Do you answer me with a few regiments?",
  "57704": "Must the young men not look at the young women?",
  "57705": "Was it as she was about to take the veil that they had cast thither that love dowry as a pledge to the world of the living?",
  "57706": "Tell him what?",
  "57707": "Why had he done this?",
  "57708": "Had he seen his father?",
  "57709": "Whom do you bring?",
  "57710": "What does it matter about the trumpery cheque?",
  "57711": "But how could I live up to it?",
  "57712": "But when I assure you that you may rely on my tenderness?",
  "57713": "And what would be the use if she were?",
  "57714": "Have there, indeed, now?",
  "57715": "For whom are you looking, my fine fellow?",
  "57716": "Why did men come to that once forbidding land ?",
  "57717": "What are you thinking of this evening?",
  "57718": "And do you now intend, on this account, to deny the debt?",
  "57719": "Are fathers unnatural, and children prodigal?",
  "57720": "Where shall I find a refuge?",
  "57721": "Who would live amidst perpetual wrangling, and scolding, and mutual reproaches?",
  "57722": "Why do you ask?",
  "57723": "Say?",
  "57724": "For how can the tears of my neighbour benefit me?",
  "57725": "Oh, where are you going, my lord?",
  "57726": "The officer of the guard, then, with his chessboard?",
  "57727": "Is it not then reasonable to infer that, if he had really been guilty of forming a base conspiracy against the fame and fortunes of a rival, he would have expressed some remorse for so serious a crime?",
  "57728": "Do you think the experiment will work?",
  "57729": "What is wrong?",
  "57730": "And can you send me to the station this afternoon?",
  "57731": "Nor him?",
  "57732": "And have these pets got anything on THEIR minds, eh?",
  "57733": "Had you any emeralds?",
  "57734": "And are you going?",
  "57735": "At what o'clock was it raised?",
  "57736": "All of them?",
  "57737": "Do you remember this?",
  "57738": "In the house?",
  "57739": "I say, what's the matter?",
  "57740": "Shall I go and dance before these demons and let them see what a human being can do?",
  "57741": "Why have men of superior endowments submitted to such degradation?",
  "57742": "You, a detective?",
  "57743": "Yes, but they are a long way off, those isles, are they not?",
  "57744": "Then after all my dreams, after all my patience, you do not love me at last?",
  "57745": "Now which are you going to marry?",
  "57746": "And how is your friend?",
  "57747": "Who forces you to do so?",
  "57748": "And his last promotion was due to you?",
  "57749": "Yes, you have seen him?",
  "57750": "Who could expect otherwise than that, with the prospect before him of viewing the giant among planets, ten times nearer than any mortal eye had ever done, he should have begrudged every moment that distracted his attention?",
  "57751": "I have?",
  "57752": "Which concerns me?",

  "59598": "And what's a sonne?",
  "59599": "What am I to say to him?",
  "59600": "And in the first place, he will honour studies which impress these qualities on his soul and disregard others?",
  "59601": "Would I come and look at it?",
  "59602": "Did you remark the postmarks of those letters?",
  "59603": "Do you see what I meant about the clothes falling off?",
  "59604": "Where is your escort?",
  "59605": "Is it necessary, pray, to illustrate a remark in so practical a style?",
  "59606": "Would he go and describe his rough reception, or recount his exploit?",

  "59610": "What can have happened?",
  "59611": "I presume you know, gentlemen, to whom my friend is indebted for this piece of patronage?",
  "59612": "Why are you distressed?",
  "59613": "Are you going to have lunch too?",
  "59614": "And what is the means?",
  "59615": "And if I did know them now, what would it avail me?",
  "59616": "What would you have?",
  "59617": "Revels?",
  "59618": "Now will you believe I'm in earnest?",
  "59619": "Is the sun up?",
  "59620": "Oh, what's that?",
  "59621": "Is it the immediate object of this confidence, that you may at once ascertain that, with my knowledge?",
  "59622": "How large was it?",
  "59623": "Then had I not best send him about his business?",
  "59624": "What does it matter?",
  "59625": "Shall we invite him into our hearts?",
  "59626": "What have you done with her, then, if you have her no longer?",
  "59627": "Then you'll not be wanting me any more tonight, ma'am?",
  "59628": "Jane, do you hear that nightingale singing in the wood?",
  "59629": "Where could they be going?",
  "59630": "Not in regular government pay and employment, to lay traps?",
  "59631": "But who could affirm, who would dare to say, that the amiable fellow did not really see that which his two companions would not see?",
  "59632": "What was it that she wanted of him?",
  "59633": "Where are the nearest?",
  "59634": "How has he drawn you to himself?",
  "59635": "Not even of sending me a scrap of stuff for a new dress?",
  "59636": "If he cuts off one of his own toes, or one of his assistants', would you be very much astonished?",
  "59637": "Was the weather hot or cold?",
  "59638": "Where was my baggage?",
  "59639": "Authority?",
  "59640": "Tell him or not tell him?",
  "59641": "O you will let me hold your brave hand, stranger?",
  "59642": "You think so, my lord?",
  "59643": "In your left ear?",
  "59644": "Who shall live up to the great trust?",
  "59645": "Are we there already?",
  "59646": "And my council dares to temper and negotiate?",
  "59647": "How are you?",
  "59648": "But what?",
  "59649": "It was you, was it not?",
  "59650": "Am I not by?",
  "59651": "Have you given up loving her altogether?",
  "59652": "What good does it do?",
  "59653": "You have never heard her nephew play?",
  "59654": "What sin, mademoiselle?",
  "59655": "Or that it is impossible to draw more than one right line betwixt any two points?",
  "59656": "Do you think I could ever skip like that?",
  "59657": "Can you send me to the station?",
  "59658": "When did you leave service?",
  "59659": "Well, what do you think of that?",
  "59660": "What DO you know of him?",
  "59661": "What good will he be to the tribe?",
  "59662": "What, did you come digging here entirely because of me?",
  "59663": "Do you feel that you have lost her?",

  "59671": "You have no trouble, I hope, to keep you waking?",
  "59672": "What is, or was, their address?",
  "59673": "But of what disease, then, did she die?",
  "59674": "Trodden upon by whom?",
  "59675": "Mighty men?",
  "59676": "No, but what do you mean?",
  "59677": "Yes, I am out of temper, and do you know why?",
  "59678": "Did you ever hear anything like your brother's eloquence?",
  "59679": "And what is the use of a fellow having a little money if it does not make him independent?",
  "59680": "Why have you no pride?",
  "59681": "Who are you, that you are to play with two young people's affections and break their hearts at your will?",
