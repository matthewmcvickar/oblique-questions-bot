  "1559": "He supposed he was right?",
  "1560": "Is nothing due to the man whom we have all such reason to love, and no reason in the world to think ill of?",
  "1561": "But when you are not sure whether it is a fact or not, what are you to do?",

  "1634": "Would it be some young man or other whom she takes an interest in?",
  "1635": "Is it absolutely necessary to go on with the letter, darling?",
  "1636": "Is that a genuine letter you are reading?",
  "1637": "What could be better?",
  "1638": "What has she been telling you?",
  "1639": "Why is that little, and the little freedom they enjoy, to be infringed?",

  "1656": "How, then, will competition be harmoniously determined in society?",
  "1657": "Have I got to drink that stuff?",
  "1658": "Ruined her?",
  "1659": "So that I need not make use of this petition?",
  "1660": "But what do you conclude from that, father?",

  "2174": "Have you not received any?",
  "2175": "What is changed?",
  "2176": "Why not be bestial, and go the whole round of experience?",
  "2177": "Have I upset you?",
  "2178": "How had she known that he it was, that is, that it was he?",
  "2179": "Did she fancy that he had meant to attack her with it?",
  "2180": "You remember, I said, how the rulers were chosen before?",
  "2181": "Do you think there is no weaker brother among all our lodges that could not be bought?",
  "2182": "And kill them?",
  "2183": "To fairs, markets, races, and so forth, I suppose?",
  "2184": "Why are YOU tramping?",
  "2185": "Am I to proceed in my work?",
  "2186": "Graduating well, you mean?",
  "2187": "Why is it that we hesitate?",
  "2188": "Or have you not begun to think about it yet?",
  "2189": "Surely by this time you ought to be able to understand something?",
  "2190": "Who are YOU in this establishment?",
  "2191": "Would not any decent soldier smite him across the face instead of grasping him by the hand?",
  "2192": "Lonely, like the devil, and envious like him?",
  "2193": "But how came he to have so singular a companion?",
  "2194": "Do I understand that he asked for more, after he had eaten the supper allotted by the dietary?",
  "2195": "Had he said anything to give himself away?",
  "2196": "Were they possibly the earth beating time?",
  "2197": "Was he poking fun, or not?",
  "2198": "What's the matter with this fellow?",
  "2199": "Sikes is not, I suppose?",
  "2200": "Why should I tell you what you cannot alter?",
  "2201": "Shall I go to her?",
  "2202": "Is he not, duke?",
  "2203": "And how old were you at that time?",
  "2204": "Why should we not all go?",
  "2205": "I ask what this pretended revolution has revolutionized?",
  "2206": "Do you suppose they keep vodka for sale?",
  "2207": "For how long a time?",
  "2208": "He could be neither of these things, for he had never heard of them, but do you think he is to be pitied for that?",
  "2209": "What makes you think so?",
  "2210": "I do not know, and what if I did?",
  "2211": "What is soon done, sir?",
  "2212": "Is that what you're waiting about for?",
  "2213": "How came ye to talk about that?",
  "2214": "There is a certain formidable machine, have you seen it?",
  "2215": "You hear, D'Artagnan?",
  "2216": "In other words, what are the most salient episodes and the most remarkable phases of the war between labor and capital?",
  "2217": "Ah, really?",
  "2218": "It would be a grand thing for one of those girls, wouldn't it?",
  "2219": "But how is it that you do these things?",
  "2220": "What is it about your pay?",
  "2221": "And you don't think me as handsome as your grandfather?",
  "2222": "Was this another hallucination?",
  "2223": "But, tell me, you have no one else staying here, have you?",
  "2224": "Do they display their charms merely to amuse them?",
  "2225": "Shall we use these, and so be even as to weapons?",
  "2226": "And why should you expect me to take you out riding?",
  "2227": "And what is it done in?",
  "2228": "What, then, are the conditions, the LAWS, of human society?",
  "2229": "Why not, indeed, seeing that at least it would have brought comfort to the poor people of this place?",
  "2230": "It was your play, I believe?",
  "2231": "Yes, monsieur, but once more, to what purpose are all these questions?",
  "2232": "And why now, my pretty simplicity?",
  "2233": "Besides, who knows?",
  "2234": "Why can't people take a line and stick to it?",
  "2235": "Which means, I suppose, that you refuse the service which I asked of you?",
  "2236": "Anything wrong?",
  "2237": "I suppose he can wait below?",
  "2238": "I suppose you have heard what's been happening to the beauty on the hill?",
  "2239": "Whose is that light which makes the eye to see perfectly and the visible to appear?",
  "2240": "The boys weep, and do you not think it is right that a father should weep?",
  "2241": "And what would he have done, the loafer, tell me, what would he have done?",
  "2242": "And what is doing?",
  "2243": "Is there a flood?",
  "2244": "How far had he walked?",
  "2245": "Your second brother?",
  "2246": "What was the use of sending for him?",
  "2247": "And where does he come from?",
  "2248": "What is it, duke?",
  "2249": "Pythangelus?",
  "2250": "I was going to ask, mama, before you were married, had you many suitors?",
  "2251": "Why should you hate the moon?",
  "2252": "Do you know the chapel?",
  "2253": "Who IS it?",
  "2254": "Where are all the eyes that heretofore watched me?",
  "2255": "Know you not, then, that your life is my life, and your death my death?",
  "2256": "Have you relatives?",
  "2257": "She may be free?",
  "2258": "Where is their road?",
  "2259": "Why not attack at once?",
  "2260": "What is allowed, then?",
  "2261": "Is she kind as she is fair?",
  "2262": "But where could such a hound lie concealed, where did it get its food, where did it come from, how was it that no one saw it by day?",
  "2263": "Have we made an erroneous interpretation of the document?",
  "2264": "Let me go on your bob?",
  "2265": "And what if I think to kill you now?",
  "2266": "And you will tell me this secret?",
  "2267": "Is this body destined for such work?",
  "2268": "Your majesty is joking, have you not a million?",
  "2269": "Is there nothing you could take to give you present relief?",
  "2270": "Ought you to feel discouraged?",
  "2271": "To be sure, he who never liveth at the right time, how could he ever die at the right time?",
  "2272": "What will become of her now?",
  "2273": "What are you coming for?",
  "2274": "What's pretence?",
  "2275": "Hadn't I better play something?",
  "2276": "And why did you wish to see me?",
  "2277": "Call?",
  "2278": "Was it possible that we were on our way down through the mountains again?",
  "2279": "Well, what DO you know of him?",
  "2280": "A woman or an ape?",
  "2281": "Day?",
  "2282": "Who said I would not go?",
  "2283": "What was that?",
  "2284": "How is it he leaves me alone in my misery?",
  "2285": "What is the use of preserving slang?",
  "2286": "But what have I done to inspire you with such a feeling of thankfulness?",
  "2287": "You have, then, fulfilled my command, and composed a new interlude?",
  "2288": "The mysterious speaker?",
  "2289": "And how should I be able to recognize, and know, and designate by name what is strange to me, and what I have never before felt?",
  "2290": "No divisions?",
  "2291": "You don't mean you are coming with us?",
  "2292": "For your marriage?",
  "2293": "Did they want to kill you?",
  "2294": "Am I in the right?",
  "2295": "Brickmakers, eh?",
  "2296": "Well, what does it all mean?",
  "2297": "To anybody?",
  "2298": "What do you hope, then?",
  "2299": "Well, would you mind my reforming myself this afternoon?",
  "2300": "Then you know me?",
  "2301": "What about meals?",
  "2302": "ART SICK?",
  "2303": "And what did he do?",
  "2304": "And her brother?",
  "2305": "You have heerd tell of cotton rags dipt in turpentine, hav'nt you, how they produce combustion?",
  "2306": "But what appeal could it be?",
  "2307": "Wrong?",
  "2308": "Do you want me to tell everything?",
  "2309": "Rob suggested?",
  "2310": "And is the soul in agreement with the affections of the body?",
  "2311": "Would you like this room, sir?",
  "2312": "What do I hear?",
  "2313": "Shall I stop the boat and try to get you out here?",
  "2314": "You?",
  "2315": "Markova?",
  "2316": "You haven't any place to go, have you?",
  "2317": "What is there for us?",
  "2318": "Besides, shall we not bear the lords of the habitable earth to be lords over us, and yet bear tyrants of our own country?",
  "2319": "When, and in what month?",
  "2320": "But what are we to do with him?",
  "2321": "Why can you not bear them?",
  "2322": "I wonder if all the things move along with us?",
  "2323": "Why this negation, if a modification was sufficient?",
  "2324": "Was this idolized parent still in existence?",
  "2325": "Who follows me?",
  "2326": "But how in the name of all that's wonderful does he GET OUT?",
  "2327": "Could the professor throw any light upon that?",
  "2328": "Can't we be good friends?",
  "2329": "Could it be possible that the sense of unreality in which he felt himself imprisoned had communicated itself to his wife?",
  "2330": "Why alas?",
  "2331": "What do you mean by that, monsieur?",
  "2332": "After having met with so many who promised, when shall I find one who will give?",
  "2333": "What the deuce are you talking about?",
  "2334": "Coffins, where?",
  "2335": "You are not in debt, then?",
  "2336": "Why should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice of the people?",
  "2337": "I love you, I?",
  "2338": "Surely there is no necessity for you to say one word, mama?",
  "2339": "That's eight months she has been away, surely?",
  "2340": "Who shall go in?",
  "2341": "Will you sell them for five francs?",
  "2342": "Why negotiate, and above all why retreat, when to retreat is so contrary to his method of conducting war?",
  "2343": "You wanted to speak to her?",
  "2344": "But am I not your nearest relative?",
  "2345": "Then what do you think, mother, has become of 'em?",
  "2346": "You have written to your father?",
  "2347": "Ought it not?",
  "2348": "Did he tell you so himself?",
  "2349": "The ladies are great observers, sir?",
  "2350": "Are you come to do anything in my way, sir?",
  "2351": "Have you honours?",
  "2352": "I may marry somebody when I grow up but I'm far too young to be thinking of it yet, don't you think, teacher?",
  "2353": "Suppose, now, I could give you up to a rich man who would be able to insure you against all wants?",
  "2354": "If so, why is it not among his papers?",
  "2355": "What's your name, portress?",
  "2356": "How big is this hole?",
  "2357": "Jest t' pull me along outer th' road?",
  "2358": "Hear you how they are sawing and hammering there below?",
  "2359": "Don't ye love sperm?",
  "2360": "Now what say you to aluminum, gentlemen?",
  "2361": "How much am I worth?",
  "2362": "What put that in your head?",
  "2363": "Had she never looked for the door?",
  "2364": "Everything?",
  "2365": "Do you think he will object to it?",
  "2366": "What think you of such a song as this?",
  "2367": "Have they not heard that of their colonel?",
  "2368": "Who was the gentleman?",
  "2369": "How could he have me in view, and not be aware of it himself?",
  "2370": "What is your name?",
  "2371": "How did I take to it?",
  "2372": "And she is getting on well, you say?",
  "2373": "Have you anything to ask, sire, before we part?",
  "2374": "Are you mad?",
  "2375": "And what does it mean?",
  "2376": "Now, then, who are you?",
  "2377": "Why do I wish to unite you two?",
  "2378": "Do I look like a sweep, then?",
  "2379": "Why, how fail to understand?",
  "2380": "You understand me?",
  "2381": "Brownlow, I believe, sir?",
  "2382": "Why have I always to complain of you?",
  "2383": "But you killed nobody yourselves?",
  "2384": "Why do you pity them?",
  "2385": "Yes, but could not the mistake be rectified?",
  "2386": "What is the matter, said he, my chicken?",
  "2387": "Am I not to know to whom to present it?",
  "2388": "I say, madam, what do you propose to do with these papers?",
  "2389": "Yes, d'you want anything?",
  "2390": "Are we ready?",
  "2391": "Have you any better explanation?",
  "2392": "Who was it gave me that rogues' march from the stocks to the gallows's foot?",
  "2393": "Why, pray?",
  "2394": "Now could I speak of that which is not yet?",
  "2395": "What is the proprietor?",
  "2396": "Would you mind stepping in for a moment?",
  "2397": "Shall I say yes or shall I say no?",
  "2398": "What should you be out of spirits for?",
  "2399": "Do you always want to be fooled?",
  "2400": "At this last moment I ask you, have we not long been betrothed to each other in our secret hearts?",
  "2401": "Ripping, isn't it?",
  "2402": "If you hadn't a been dogged, where'd you a been now?",
  "2403": "When did this happen?",
  "2404": "Something about somebody laughing at a locksmith?",
  "2405": "For what are you fighting?",
  "2406": "And that is adding insult to injury, is it?",
  "2407": "And where will I look for 'em?",
  "2408": "Gentlemen, is that a true view of the case?",
  "2409": "It was with a hilted knife maybe?",
  "2410": "Was he really doing everything that could be expected of him?",
  "2411": "How fare ye?",
  "2412": "What noise was that?",
  "2413": "But will the person who shall accompany you afterward be a man or a woman?",
  "2414": "Yes, but how am I to give it up?",
  "2415": "We may depend on you?",
  "2416": "Does it really seem so to you?",
  "2417": "You've been tramping in the sun, and it's a very warm night, and hadn't you better sleep over the notion?",
  "2418": "And you really live by the river?",
  "2419": "Shall not the grief of the old time follow?",
  "2420": "Couldn't you manage to hold me in your arms?",
  "2421": "Isn't he very rich?",
  "2422": "Some authentic relic?",
  "2423": "Why are you not at work?",
  "2424": "Why did I suddenly loose my grip of her?",
  "2425": "Sure you did?",
  "2426": "Sylvestre?",
  "2427": "An't that as nat'ral as a sheep's bleating, or a pig's grunting, or a horse's neighing, or a bird's singing?",
  "2428": "Was it a kind of adoration for so much purity?",
  "2429": "It would have embarrassed what?",
  "2430": "Would you prefer a more humble life, a life more suited to your strength?",
  "2431": "What he?",
  "2432": "What did you suppose, then?",
  "2433": "Did we not finish it?",
  "2434": "Will you be mine?",
  "2435": "He did not proceed to blows?",
  "2436": "What else had she herself meant three minutes before by speaking of her as great?",
  "2437": "Why has the legislator given hands to this conspiracy of monopolies, to this interdict upon theories belonging to all?",
  "2438": "And do you suppose it weighs on him any less than on you?",
  "2439": "Do you wish these proofs, these attestations, which I alone possess, to be destroyed?",
  "2440": "Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?",
  "2441": "You do not like?",
  "2442": "You are going to be married?",
  "2443": "And will you, sir, get your living by the counsel of traitors?",
  "2444": "Wot job?",
  "2445": "What happened in the house?",
  "2446": "Why do you not ask the fisherman for his cutlass?",
  "2447": "If harm befell him, what would be our fate?",
  "2448": "You mark me sir?",
  "2449": "And what would you yourself say?",
  "2450": "Do you think, gentlemen, that I look like an innkeeper?",
  "2451": "Did you ever see him?",
  "2452": "And yet you say he is not a medical student?",
  "2453": "Are there children or are there not?",
  "2454": "What is he?",
  "2455": "Where have they been put?",
  "2456": "How does my sweet lady?",
  "2457": "And what was his purpose?",
  "2458": "Ah, you know it?",
  "2459": "Why don't they jump in and destroy these fliers?",
  "2460": "But with a beard, you tell me?",
  "2461": "But, on the other hand, whose blood was that which lay so thickly upon the floor?",
  "2462": "Well, what did you see, sir, or think you saw?",
  "2463": "What was taking place within him?",
  "2464": "You love me, don't you?",
  "2465": "What did you force me to run away with you for?",
  "2466": "Did I groan all right?",
  "2467": "Known what?",
  "2468": "You, my poor child, suffer poverty and hunger?",
  "2469": "Was it by his extensive knowledge, by his exquisite judgment, or by his heroic valour?",
  "2470": "Whose language would he speak?",
  "2471": "Yer powers wasn't enough to carry 'ee through?",
  "2472": "Perhaps you would care to try?",
  "2473": "Why should he change his name in a country where no one knew his original one?",
  "2474": "What can it know about the matter?",
  "2475": "Shall we begin education with music, and go on to gymnastic afterwards?",
  "2476": "Shall we try it?",
  "2477": "I hope I have not driven her away?",
  "2478": "Where does he come in?",
  "2479": "Why have you hatched these vipers which, when they shall have grown, will inflict injury on all, beginning with yourself?",
  "2480": "What have I seen?",
  "2481": "Am not I dreaming?",
  "2482": "Am I to say what you told me?",
  "2483": "What could be more just?",
  "2484": "How many shots?",
  "2485": "Why did he leave?",
  "2486": "Well, and what then?",
  "2487": "Do you pity him?",
  "2488": "To be cased up and hung by on the wall?",
  "2489": "Sword?",
  "2490": "You heard what I said to the prince?",
  "2491": "What's to be done?",
  "2492": "Are there any good men?",
  "2493": "Diminish public burdens, assess taxes on a more equitable basis?",
  "2494": "Who can deny that one's physical conditions determine one's character or personality?",
  "2495": "How am I to know?",
  "2496": "I have sent for three of my friends, but who knows whether they were at home?",
  "2497": "A qui cette voiture la?",
  "2498": "I say, aren't we much too soon?",
  "2499": "Do you like it?",
  "2500": "And who is there that will either take the trouble or incur the odium, of a strict scrunity into the secret springs of the transaction?",
  "2501": "Are the other children in bed?",
  "2502": "Does he make it against that newspaper editor merely?",
  "2503": "Why torture me now?",
  "2504": "Abideth there husband for me, after the son of my uncle?",
  "2505": "Or have you dined?",
  "2506": "Cur aliquid vidi?",
  "2507": "Or, was he?",
  "2508": "Had you ever seen it before?",
  "2509": "Have I positive and substantive proof of what I assert?",
  "2510": "How could you let it go so?",
  "2511": "Why should I look at the letter?",
  "2512": "Won't you please be good enough to send my tea into the library?",
  "2513": "But how did it turn out with me?",
  "2514": "You won't want another dog, will you?",
  "2515": "The prosecutor was reading, was he?",
  "2516": "Well, sirs, is everybody here?",
  "2517": "How are they when you've done?",
  "2518": "And you are still satisfied?",
  "2519": "How shall I understand you?",
  "2520": "But what do the young woman say herself about it?",
  "2521": "And will you tell me what you read therein, monseigneur?",
  "2522": "Would it not be a wilful throwing away of a chance not to avail himself of it?",
  "2523": "Pray, sir, what is the soul?",
  "2524": "The child, my child?",
  "2525": "Wot do you want to throw 'im over for?",
  "2526": "I say, what are we going to do?",
  "2527": "Stubbs?",
  "2528": "Does he speak loudly when spoken to by his master?",
  "2529": "But with such ideas what motive have you for living?",
  "2530": "Why, all men strive and who succeeds?",
  "2531": "Don't you smell the roses?",
  "2532": "Haven't I given up expecting anything?",
  "2533": "Where is faith?",
  "2534": "You won't be provoked with me, will you?",
  "2535": "Your father?",
  "2536": "Haven't I said I'm not going to gwovel?",
  "2537": "What more could parents do than they had done?",
  "2538": "The police?",
  "2539": "You have hopes of solving it?",
  "2540": "What's the use wearing my good ones around here?",
  "2541": "Well, what of that?",
  "2542": "Who, in such case, is to be the judge?",
  "2543": "Where have you dined?",
  "2544": "You were doubtless surprised at my letter?",
  "2545": "How could you think I should jest on such a subject?",
  "2546": "Tell me, comte, is she in love with him?",
  "2547": "What do you think now?",
  "2548": "Cannot even the fact of their being in arms for the nation, liable to die any day in its defence, secure them ordinary justice?",
  "2549": "Why, you can't live on it, can you?",
  "2550": "And the ghost of a herring cob?",
  "2551": "Why, whatever hope can you have?",
  "2552": "Are these sages alive?",
  "2553": "How on earth can I tell?",
  "2554": "Why should he take such a poor girl as you by the hand, as your letter says he has done twice?",
  "2555": "Have you know him long, miss?",
  "2556": "Nor so much as a rather reverend dissenting gentleman?",
  "2557": "You are defending me?",
  "2558": "But how do you get back on board?",
  "2559": "Well, you are their employer, ain't you?",
  "2560": "Jack, you anointed scoundrel, what do you mean?",
  "2561": "Hear him?",
  "2562": "What are these creatures doing?",
  "2563": "Have not all insects gay colours?",
  "2564": "Are you the architect of the prisons, monsieur?",
  "2565": "His kind?",
  "2566": "And you are looking after this hawk in the skies?",
  "2567": "Are all these tales such cobwebs and moon talk?",
  "2568": "But what have you done?",
  "2569": "The boys are all as they were, I suppose?",
  "2570": "Is no one to go to his assistance?",
  "2571": "Isn't it good just to be alive on a day like this?",
  "2572": "I wonder what will happen when the third time comes?",
  "2573": "Rich enough to work with tolerable peace of mind?",
  "2574": "And what is delight but another name for pleasure?",
  "2575": "You don't see who I am?",
  "2576": "Oil?",
  "2577": "You will like going, will you not?",
  "2578": "Where the devil shall I say that he is, so that he cannot try to rejoin him?",
  "2579": "But who, after all, is doing this?",
  "2580": "Then must I knock, or call when just in sight?",
  "2581": "But how can she fail to see it, and what is going on in her?",
  "2582": "Toward what quarter of the world should they direct their endeavors?",
  "2583": "Are you going to live next door to me in the box?",
  "2584": "Was this their virtue, or contempt of life?",

  "3434": "Didn't my father say I was to go?",
  "3435": "Is it not living rather?",
  "3436": "He is not dead, then?",
  "3437": "And how did it end?",
  "3438": "What is that reason?",
  "3439": "Can you stay like that a minute?",
  "3440": "Or ought we not rather to be blotted from the society of mankind, and become a spectacle of misery to the world?",
  "3441": "And the country which was enough to support the original inhabitants will be too small now, and not enough?",
  "3442": "You live alone, then?",
  "3443": "What can I know of him?",
  "3444": "Do you really think so?",
  "3445": "Are pleasures, as pleasures, alike?",
  "3446": "Am I to understand that you have this young woman's interests at heart?",

  "3453": "Nothing?",
  "3454": "WHAT IS WAR?",
  "3455": "You know the legend, I suppose?",
  "3456": "So there is something beyond duty?",
  "3457": "Then why should they quarrel with us?",
  "3458": "Say about what?",
  "3459": "But, at least, tell us who is there?",
  "3460": "Are the brethren satisfied?",
  "3461": "An't it enough we catch the boy for ye?",
  "3462": "You intend to introduce the prince?",
  "3463": "And whither was he now going?",
  "3464": "What I should rather say is does he know how much?",
  "3465": "Is there no child?",
  "3466": "But what would you have us to do here, now that the king is dead?",
  "3467": "How do men get money?",
  "3468": "Now what excuse have you to make?",
  "3469": "Whither are we going now?",
  "3470": "But have you ever watched him carefully?",
  "3471": "Shall I take the call?",
  "3472": "And what is that proof?",
  "3473": "How could you say such a thing?",
  "3474": "You didn't mind it?",
  "3475": "What hopes?",
  "3476": "Why did you never mention this?",
  "3477": "Perhaps you hate me too, now that I've told you as much?",

  "3486": "Why were they seized with senile debility in the sixteenth century?",
  "3487": "How, then, shall I conclude this very unsatisfactory account?",
  "3488": "But how about the chance of his holding someone up before he goes?",
  "3489": "How dare you sit in my throne?",
  "3490": "Shall we take off our doublets?",
  "3491": "And who for?",
  "3492": "What shall be the end of so many labours and crosses?",
  "3493": "Did he cut me?",

  "3499": "Dido loved, and what came of it?",
  "3500": "What creature?",
  "3501": "Will that man come?",
  "3502": "You weren't away?",
  "3503": "Has he done it any harm?",
  "3504": "What is it meant to prove?",
  "3505": "Do you observe?",
  "3506": "But to what did they owe the convulsion and rapture of their transport?",
  "3507": "This is getting interesting, is it not?",
  "3508": "What is there in it?",
  "3509": "Would she not be afraid to join it herself?",
  "3510": "Well, the question is, my dear prince, do you know anything about it?",
  "3511": "What does he come here cheeking us for, then?",
  "3512": "And in a railway carriage?",
  "3513": "What, my sons, shall you assail your father, friend, and chief confessed?",
  "3514": "Did you blow them up yourself?",
  "3515": "The count does not know?",
  "3516": "Is civil conquest then so base and vile?",
  "3517": "Javert?",
  "3518": "Watson?",
  "3519": "And did he arrive in time?",
  "3520": "Hein?",
  "3521": "Then why should you mind?",
  "3522": "How did that fellow get here?",
  "3523": "Experience?",
  "3524": "Then from whence, my friends, in a human point of view, do we derive the strength that is necessary to our limbs?",
  "3525": "What right has this woman to write in this way to you?",
  "3526": "WOHIN?",
  "3527": "Do you know who you are, and what you are?",
  "3528": "Do we even know whether we shall find a house in which to pass the night?",
  "3529": "Why do you think that?",
  "3530": "You wish that, too?",
  "3531": "How do you know all that?",
  "3532": "I suppose the children may begin, uncle?",
  "3533": "I do not understand how you can meet the soul of your lost mother by looking in this mirror?",
  "3534": "And she doesn't know anything?",
  "3535": "How dare you urge me to it, young man?",
  "3536": "Is she calling on the corpses to rise and have a dance among the graves?",
  "3537": "How could she write about that at all?",
  "3538": "And what we mean by 'seen' and 'not seen' is that which is or is not visible to the eye of man?",
  "3539": "Is she alone in that room?",
  "3540": "And what theory could ever have included that peculiar method?",
  "3541": "What avails reason if it cannot make me understand?",
  "3542": "But how could any of you feel sure of me when I couldn't so much as feel sure of myself?",
  "3543": "But what ought to be their course?",
  "3544": "But is the sum worth the trouble to which you expose yourself?",
  "3545": "Who really knows her?",
  "3546": "Have you had fresh news, then?",
  "3547": "Why didn't you?",
  "3548": "Why not go to those lawyers that manage things for the company and get them to arrange it all for you with the college?",
  "3549": "Mine, sire?",
  "3550": "How do you think you would write or speak about anything more difficult, if you knew no more of grammar than he does?",
  "3551": "What was the good of damping the energy they displayed in the painful work of escape?",
  "3552": "Will you soon start again?",
  "3553": "Punished?",
  "3554": "Would we do anything which would hurt or offend you?",
  "3555": "You have not let those four men go?",
  "3556": "If, then, the proprietor, shielding himself behind his comfort and his rights, refuses to employ the laborer, how can the laborer live?",
  "3557": "Is it you that would dispute it?",
  "3558": "You heard a horse was stolen from our neighbour yesterday?",
  "3559": "What is it that's wrong with her?",
  "3560": "Where is your room?",
  "3561": "What wicked gossip were you talking over there?",
  "3562": "But in how many does your worship think we shall have the use of our feet?",
  "3563": "And which does the soul resemble?",
  "3564": "What business had she to do it?",
  "3565": "But how do you do?",
  "3566": "Do you think you can escape?",
  "3567": "Verum secretumque mouseion, quam multa invenitis, quam multa dictatis?",
  "3568": "Why do they offer it?",
  "3569": "Now what can I do for you all?",
  "3570": "Then he is no longer sad?",
  "3571": "Don't I listen to her willingly?",
  "3572": "What future?",
  "3573": "What sets him on?",
  "3574": "What hidden thing could be in that room that she did not wish him to see?",
  "3575": "Is he your friend, by any chance?",
  "3576": "Shall you write to him?",
  "3577": "Aren't you ever going to finish that story and give me some of the profits?",
  "3578": "We are safe here, at last, eh?",
  "3579": "Tell me at once, why have you suddenly developed this 'profound respect,' eh?",
  "3580": "Then you are rich?",
  "3581": "You heard that?",
  "3582": "And why so?",
  "3583": "How could the king have fallen in love with her?",
  "3584": "What would that answer be?",
  "3585": "What did they think of the proposal?",
  "3586": "Was not that what ye said?",
  "3587": "Must I?",
  "3588": "But are you sure it's the lady, and not the gentleman?",
  "3589": "And who would employ him, ostensibly?",
  "3590": "It's profitable enough for two, is it?",
  "3591": "Then for a holiday?",
  "3592": "Why do the sun and the earth seem changeless and constant to you?",
  "3593": "Do you know what that means?",
  "3594": "What makes people call them green?",
  "3595": "Why, do you suspect his merit?",
  "3596": "And we shall neither have CHARQUI, nor hard eggs, nor fillets of ostrich?",
  "3597": "What does he teach you?",
  "3598": "Why do you ask me now?",
  "3599": "What is to be the end of this?",
  "3600": "Does he want me to throw a bottle at his head?",
  "3601": "What town is it, mister?",
  "3602": "Well, don't you see what I'm driving at?",
  "3603": "The masters?",
  "3604": "How can you have knowledge not in your head?",
  "3605": "Could a human society of any sort exist if there were no sympathy or tender feeling, no impulse to seek the company of other men?",
  "3606": "What effect do you think it will have upon his plans now that he knows you are here?",
  "3607": "How can you tell me what you know is false?",
  "3608": "What woman is there worth a straw that has not?",
  "3609": "Was it dry?",
  "3610": "Can I see him?",
  "3611": "Why, are you not?",
  "3612": "Apart from personal vanity, what would they sell it for?",
  "3613": "Yet are you not capricious, sir?",
  "3614": "Did you ask her why she hurried away that night?",
  "3615": "Do you belong on it?",
  "3616": "What were those masses?",
  "3617": "Would it not have been much more convenient to take all that kind of goods on board in 'Frisco?",
  "3618": "You think, then, that you could live more wisely than other people?",
  "3619": "Or am I a liar?",
  "3620": "Where are they now?",
  "3621": "If it were one of your friends you would hesitate, then?",
  "3622": "But does your fair interpret industry?",
  "3623": "Where are your servants?",
  "3624": "Was she out with him today?",
  "3625": "Isn't it disgusting?",
  "3626": "How can it, if we two be secret?",
  "3627": "But where shall I go?",
  "3628": "And over yonder?",
  "3629": "What breaks in me?",
  "3630": "How did the physician's father get his fortune?",
  "3631": "But perhaps you will be angry with me for it when we meet again presently?",
  "3632": "Did you speak with him?",
  "3633": "Who is he that walks alone between the companies?",
  "3634": "What his promises?",
  "3635": "Why not, madame?",
  "3636": "Well, what IS the song, then?",
  "3637": "What is it you would say?",
  "3638": "Won't you let me do that for you?",
  "3639": "Did you find nothing in the room which could furnish a clue to the murderer?",
  "3640": "The scout has said as much?",
  "3641": "Who was it then?",
  "3642": "Is the steward an apothecary, sir?",
  "3643": "Can we solve the problems confronting us?",
  "3644": "Hadn't you better notify the police?",
  "3645": "What of?",
  "3646": "Shall we suppose that it is impossible to discover it?",
  "3647": "It's a little awkward for me, isn't it?",
  "3648": "Laws, how do I know?",
  "3649": "And why are we afraid of death, while we are pleased with the rest that we have in sleep?",
  "3650": "And would you still cane me if I took it into my head to disobey you?",
  "3651": "Is it TOM?",
  "3652": "Whence can it arise, then?",
  "3653": "Is this just towards her?",
  "3654": "Has he come home, sir?",
  "3655": "A play?",
  "3656": "Where then have you been?",
  "3657": "What could that light be?",
  "3658": "Why don't you supply the city?",
  "3659": "What's the good of a man flittering away his life?",
  "3660": "Kryltzoff, have you any cigarettes?",
  "3661": "But the sun?",
  "3662": "Who, therefore, O king of the world, among all those who vaunt themselves as having luck, has more than I have?",
  "3663": "You think, then, all is not over yet?",
  "3664": "Can there be two opinions of the advantage of education?",
  "3665": "There has been no battle, then?",
  "3666": "Am I to accompany you, your excellency?",
  "3667": "Have you ever worked at anything before?",
  "3668": "In all my embassies have I been weak to the strong or bullying toward the weak?",
  "3669": "Are you not the beloved of one of my best friends?",
  "3670": "And if that be so, upon whom should they call to their helping rather than him who can help them most, and is their very lord?",
  "3671": "What do you want, my friend?",
  "3672": "Should he station a whole company at the post?",
  "3673": "Can anything be done to relieve situation, now acute?",
  "3674": "But is this equally true of the greatness and smallness of the fingers?",
  "3675": "And our masters?",
  "3676": "HAD he reason?",
  "3677": "He said something in praise of your eyes, did he?",
  "3678": "Will you give him to me, monseigneur, if I ask him of you?",
  "3679": "Has he not even got his hat on?",
  "3680": "Will it be any wonder if it go down to the grave with us at the appointed time?",
  "3681": "Do you know of anything with a long, thin body?",
  "3682": "Come, tell me, please, what you did abroad?",
  "3683": "I wonder if we'll ever see them again?",
  "3684": "Isn't he right that everything in the world is base and loathsome?",
  "3685": "But where are those fierce warriors now?",
  "3686": "Of whom am I talking to you?",
  "3687": "Does he put up with it?",
  "3688": "Was I born for nothing but to write?",
  "3689": "And pray who told you this?",
  "3690": "Checkers, weren't it?",
  "3691": "How often must I remind you that I'm blind?",
  "3692": "In what order shall we draw?",
  "3693": "Hasn't he gone on deck?",
  "3694": "You've done with him altogether?",
  "3695": "What does he do anything for?",
  "3696": "Who does not feel the irresistible arm drag?",
  "3697": "Money?",

  "3713": "Have you no pity, no heart?",
  "3714": "Oh, it's you, is it?",
  "3715": "Well, whose fault is it?",
  "3716": "Coming up the hill, and at the top of the hill, both?",
  "3717": "What's this, then?",
  "3718": "As for her, when would she so much go beyond herself as to accept him at the quick of death?",
  "3719": "Now go and hoe your own row?",
  "3720": "Are you going to make our shelter another tied house for him, and ask me to keep it?",
  "3721": "Do you feel your attack coming on?",
  "3722": "Go back?",
  "3723": "Don't you pray?",
  "3724": "How should he know?",
  "3725": "What would my son do?",
  "3726": "Why do you come back so late?",
  "3727": "What if we have but one home?",
  "3728": "Was she born in your house?",
  "3729": "In what respect?",
  "3730": "By obeying through fear, instead of practising the forbearance, which we all stand in need of ourselves?",
  "3731": "Did he think of escaping from it?",
  "3732": "That it may be alienated by consent, in order to beget that commerce and intercourse, which is so BENEFICIAL to human society?",
  "3733": "Lansquenet, for instance?",
  "3734": "Do you see that?",
  "3735": "Has my wife told you that you two are free to go off whenever you please?",
  "3736": "Neb, perhaps?",
  "3737": "Even ignorance?",

  "3744": "Oh, whoever you may be, do you not remember?",
  "3745": "Have there ever been such philosophers?",
  "3746": "Have you then never seen it not only as your right, but as your bounden duty, worked up to such a pitch, to speak to your husband?",
  "3747": "I suppose she feels the separation from them?",
  "3748": "Why shouldn't I?",
  "3749": "Then you beg?",
  "3750": "Who writes a keener epigram?",
  "3751": "Haven't you any news for us?",
  "3752": "Have you an order to see him in prison?",
  "3753": "With him near, who could entertain fear?",
  "3754": "But where can I get pistols?",
  "3755": "What is death for me?",
  "3756": "Then, if all souls are equally by their nature souls, all souls of all living creatures will be equally good?",

  "3758": "What more did she want than to know and feel this?",
  "3759": "Are you going to listen to her ravings?",
  "3760": "Besides, were not those riches chimerical?",
  "3761": "But can they proclaim themselves entirely irresponsible for this condition?",
  "3762": "There's nothing you'll be wanting, is there?",
  "3763": "How does it serve you right?",
  "3764": "Were they to be weighed against pounds sterling per annum?",
  "3765": "Which are the better at heavy physical tasks, boys or men?",
  "3766": "Any answer, ma'am?",
  "3767": "Smoke?",
  "3768": "What signs are there of a hound?",
  "3769": "What will the owners say, sir?",
  "3770": "Do you make that of it?",
  "3771": "Nothing better to do?",
  "3772": "Am I then a dog?",
  "3773": "Somebody hurt?",
  "3774": "Is he a poor man?",
  "3775": "And what is the prime of life?",
  "3776": "But how is it that judgment is perverted on the one hand, and on the other that faculties are degraded?",
  "3777": "What was he to do now?",
  "3778": "Shall we be trotting home again?",
  "3779": "Now, officers, have you done?",
  "3780": "Or popularity?",
  "3781": "No, men are so cowardly, aren't they?",
  "3782": "Is he ill, or simply shamming?",
  "3783": "And did she find these details tedious?",
  "3784": "Primmins?",
  "3785": "Or shall it take a paternal interest in its citizens, making them virtuous and happy in spite of themselves?",

  "3822": "Is it any wonder, then, that I prize it?",
  "3823": "But not much, is it?",
  "3824": "Could you trust in him?",
  "3825": "Is it to be believed?",
  "3826": "I wonder what dey'll be doin' next?",
  "3827": "What are you doing down here?",
  "3828": "Ran into her?",
  "3829": "Would it not be expecting too much to hope to succeed at your first attempt?",
  "3830": "If he no longer cares for me, why silent?",
  "3831": "Mangles?",
  "3832": "Who would deny his mistress aught?",
  "3833": "And the good is advantageous?",
  "3834": "When was it decided?",
  "3835": "Could it have been otherwise?",
  "3836": "Shall I tell you about him?",
  "3837": "According to the dactyle?",
  "3838": "Why shouldn't he tell us something?",
  "3839": "Did you really slap her?",
  "3840": "How soon would I get a place?",
  "3841": "Then, how do you know?",
  "3842": "How shall I describe what we saw?",
  "3843": "Well, and whose fault is that?",
  "3844": "What would she think of him if he now devoted himself to a married woman?",
  "3845": "Why did you not return?",
  "3846": "Was any desire more rational?",
  "3847": "Does he understand?",
  "3848": "Well, does not this tell you that in grief, as in life, there is always something to look forward to beyond?",
  "3849": "And how had he been paid?",
  "3850": "What is the right of occupancy?",
  "3851": "Do you really mean it?",
  "3852": "Why have you not advised me?",

  "5526": "Lordy, what did you do?",
  "5527": "So you'll not tell, will you?",
  "5528": "Why did he not bring it to me here?",
  "5529": "Do you mean to say a woman isn't beautiful after she is twenty?",
  "5530": "What is all that noise?",
  "5531": "Has he escaped?",
  "5532": "Have you got him?",
  "5533": "Has he a mother?",
  "5534": "Would he carry him on with him?",
  "5535": "You mean that you think there was no accident?",
  "5536": "Why, dear?",
  "5537": "How badly?",
  "5538": "Why should he not go to the home of his fathers?",
  "5539": "Is that all he does?",
  "5540": "Ah, where in the world have there been greater follies than with the pitiful?",
  "5541": "But what is the latest news of him?",
  "5542": "You know we want some help in the servant staff of the hospital?",
  "5543": "Of money?",
  "5544": "Who will plant the flag on the barricade again?",
  "5545": "Was the fire wholly extinct there?",
  "5546": "Why did you originally go away from me?",
  "5547": "But are not these spirited natures apt to be savage with one another, and with everybody else?",
  "5548": "How did this come about?",
  "5549": "What do I know about arms or supports?",
  "5550": "What does she make a sham for, and pretend to give me money, and take it away again?",
  "5551": "And was this conference arranged beforehand?",
  "5552": "Wherefore should I hold, good fellow?",
  "5553": "What have you done with your fur?",
  "5554": "Is not that true?",
  "5555": "And do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to her daughters, than to us?",
  "5556": "But why must I promise that?",
  "5557": "And what do you know?",
  "5558": "Will you have it so, or will you share your lover's punishment?",
  "5559": "And why on earth does she want to speak to me at all?",
  "5560": "What did you do it for?",
  "5561": "What can I do to serve you?",
  "5562": "What reason had you to strike the man who won my daughter?",
  "5563": "May it not be defined as a period of about twenty years in a woman's life, and thirty in a man's?",
  "5564": "What good is arguments to me?",
  "5565": "And who escapes his lot?",
  "5566": "How is she looking?",
  "5567": "Why so?",
  "5568": "What did he wish for?",
  "5569": "Would she take it as a joke?",
  "5570": "And is she not effectually degraded?",
  "5571": "Final for couples?",
  "5572": "They must be sold, I suppose?",
  "5573": "But what shall I do?",
  "5574": "Who can tell what a dark, dreary, hopeless life I have dragged on for months past?",
  "5575": "What could be the trouble in that quarter?",
  "5576": "What does it matter, after all?",
  "5577": "What is the result of it?",
  "5578": "Did you hear that cry?",
  "5579": "Oh, don't you see?",
  "5580": "Did you ever see such a large peach in all your life?",
  "5581": "How much are you to give him?",
  "5582": "How many?",
  "5583": "Everything as it used to be?",
  "5584": "And how may that be?",
  "5585": "Are you comfortable?",
  "5586": "Can there be a rational adjustment of the claims of each?",
  "5587": "Father, that money is mine, why should I speak to you about that?",
  "5588": "Surely, sweet, it shall never be our dwelling?",
  "5589": "If he is it's not much good my coming, is it?",
  "5590": "Boys, an't this yer fun?",
  "5591": "Would those stiff trees that had outlived the eagle, turn young and airy pages to him, to skip on his errands when he bade them?",
  "5592": "What is their story?",
  "5593": "At what hour shall we come?",
  "5594": "Have you any tips to give us before we clear out?",
  "5595": "Which is the principal aim of these three?",
  "5596": "That's to you, I suppose, child?",
  "5597": "How must I arrange it, then?",
  "5598": "Is it really?",
  "5599": "Do you want any assistance?",
  "5600": "Yes, and is there a rope handy?",
  "5601": "Do you think it would be good for you?",
  "5602": "Suppose I handed you over to the police?",
  "5603": "And is the art of war one of those arts in which she can or can not share?",
  "5604": "And when did you arrive here?",
  "5605": "But how did he procure his books?",
  "5606": "You know her only son died eight years ago?",
  "5607": "How far do you purpose to extend your walk?",
  "5608": "At once?",
  "5609": "You do not like it, then?",
  "5610": "Shan't I disturb you?",
  "5611": "Non es eques, quare?",
  "5612": "Boys, ma'am?",
  "5613": "Wait a little, if you don't mind, and if you have time to spare?",
  "5614": "Has he asked you to give me the message?",
  "5615": "Some holy book, no doubt?",
  "5616": "Is it possible that one can forget and forsake what he once loved?",
  "5617": "Shall I put myself into the harness to be worn out like an old horse?",
  "5618": "You come from the contractor, you say?",
  "5619": "Why do you do it?",
  "5620": "Am I never to hear the last of this?",
  "5621": "You say that these thirteen millions are found to be wanting in the accounts?",
  "5622": "Then why not admit that these may be replaced some day by other moral intuitions to be evolved in an unknown future?",
  "5623": "What of yourself?",
  "5624": "Can't you now, doctor?",
  "5625": "Surely there must be someone among all of you here who will turn this shameless creature out of the room?",
  "5626": "What on earth is the use of time to a fellow who has twice as much of it as he knows what to do with?",
  "5627": "Or had he found something he wished to keep to himself?",
  "5628": "And how do these wiseacres know that man wants a normal, a virtuous choice?",
  "5629": "Why not furnish an unequivocal explanation of its object?",
  "5630": "Do you see that mainmast there?",
  "5631": "Any letters for me?",
  "5632": "Why are you so upset?",
  "5633": "Have you never felt the romance of that love?",
  "5634": "An explanation, pray, of what?",
  "5635": "And how on earth do they get at it?",
  "5636": "Do they get you bairns?",
  "5637": "Cannot one find friends among the animals, and choose some tame kid or eloquent parrot or amiable monkey?",
  "5638": "You wish to exchange crosses?",
  "5639": "Well, and did you like it very much?",
  "5640": "Would you mind describing him to me?",
  "5641": "But do you understand the mission you are fulfilling?",
  "5642": "What do YOU mean, mother?",
  "5643": "How about accidents?",
  "5644": "Do you think this is the end?",
  "5645": "Doing well, I suppose?",
  "5646": "Where 'bouts do you live?",
  "5647": "And then, mother?",
  "5648": "Do you sometimes think that I took an unfair advantage of your weakness?",
  "5649": "In what way did you mean it, sir?",
  "5650": "What did the gentleman say to her, my sonny?",
  "5651": "Did he name no one in his passion?",
  "5652": "What kind of political ambition was to result from this destructive political education?",
  "5653": "He knows them, then?",
  "5654": "Could narrow passages spread from it through the foundations of the island?",
  "5655": "Suppose we were to meet any of them?",
  "5656": "Have you anything?",
  "5657": "And what is the cause of this?",
  "5658": "Or flatter sorry bunglers?",
  "5659": "By my orders?",
  "5660": "So you do not plead guilty?",
  "5661": "Now, are not you fancying, gentlemen, that I am expressing remorse for something now, that I am asking your forgiveness for something?",
  "5662": "Would a man grow weary of such a look turned on him, of such arms held out?",
  "5663": "Why does she give me notice when it's too late?",
  "5664": "I suppose they'll take her back, won't they?",
  "5665": "D'ye know anything of it?",
  "5666": "Why then do we not follow his example, doing as he did in the countries through which we pass?",
  "5667": "Cancel?",
  "5668": "And have you forgiven her for all she has made you suffer?",
  "5669": "Which of us is there can tell how much vanity lurks in our warmest regard for others, and how selfish our love is?",
  "5670": "Has the owner many ships?",
  "5671": "To a distance?",
  "5672": "This house?",
  "5673": "You think it would?",
  "5674": "Are you having a good time?",
  "5675": "Have you heard this?",
  "5676": "Why, where have you been?",
  "5677": "But now who will relieve me of the dread?",
  "5678": "Have the which?",
  "5679": "Why don't you snap your oars, you rascals?",
  "5680": "Is it not obvious?",
  "5681": "Why did you come to tell me yourself, instead of sending my man?",
  "5682": "Holidays?",
  "5683": "I mean did you see the statue fall?",
  "5684": "And she refused you as she says?",
  "5685": "Father went away to give us children room, didn't he?",
  "5686": "Durbeyfield?",
  "5687": "Can I see the letter?",
  "5688": "In what then, pray, shall I obey you?",
  "5689": "Why should you make a principle out of what you yourselves are, and must be?",
  "5690": "Why should we imagine that the precious metals are likely to do so?",
  "5691": "And what did he answer?",
  "5692": "What IS the matter?",
  "5693": "Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?",
  "5694": "What could he say to her now, after all he had said formerly, when he held her hands as he kissed her hair beside her cheeks?",
  "5695": "No female nurses?",
  "5696": "How did you happen to think of it?",
  "5697": "Where, then, is the power of your wealthy man?",
  "5698": "And what can I do but obey their commands?",
  "5699": "Would it, indeed, have been better if we had loved each other as a boy and a girl, and forgotten it?",
  "5700": "What social and political rights have women?",
  "5701": "And are they arrested?",
  "5702": "Puffs?",
  "5703": "Didn't they denounce the fenian movement from the pulpit and in the confession box?",
  "5704": "Isn't it time to skim it, my dear?",
  "5705": "Where do they come from, then?",
  "5706": "Marriage?",
  "5707": "Now, sir, why are you late again, as usual?",
  "5708": "Might anybody ask what their brother has been saying?",
  "5709": "Well, my children, what is going on now?",
  "5710": "What death?",
  "5711": "To what party did he belong?",
  "5712": "Does that suggest nothing to you?",
  "5713": "Where away?",
  "5714": "How did you penetrate hither?",
  "5715": "Caught cold in the grottos, at night, perhaps?",
  "5716": "You are sure?",
  "5717": "Well, and what did the last one say to ye?",
  "5718": "Did you come in the gig?",
  "5719": "And the DISENCHANTMENT of woman is in progress?",
  "5720": "Had your breakfast yet?",
  "5721": "Could he write something original?",
  "5722": "Breakfast?",
  "5723": "Now what does this imply?",
  "5724": "What possessed him to turn listener?",
  "5725": "Is this not a quite unusual politeness?",
  "5726": "Whatever have you done now?",
  "5727": "Are these things nothing?",
  "5728": "Did my sons get power and money?",
  "5729": "If they are such a happy class of people, how was it that you had such a time of punishing and hanging them within the last two years?",
  "5730": "And I have no doubt she loves you like a brother?",
  "5731": "And what have you been thinking about THEM, my busy bee?",
  "5732": "But how will it be?",
  "5733": "Could anything exceed the picture he gives one of scientific ardour?",
  "5734": "There is no exit that way?",
  "5735": "But was he worse?",
  "5736": "Yet how long before it was unsettled again?",
  "5737": "Philanthropy's sake?",
  "5738": "Or are they late because they have had a lovers' meeting?",
  "5739": "Is he very ill?",
  "5740": "Did he know them before?",
  "5741": "Cranly asked softly, happier than you are now, for instance?",
  "5742": "Why, what on earth does she do here?",
  "5743": "What does it matter to me whether the prince is to be what the late king was?",
  "5744": "Didn't I tell you now, mum, as it 'ud hurt your feelings to look at my pack?",
  "5745": "How can I urge my daughters now to go and raise large families?",
  "5746": "And what did it matter?",
  "5747": "What are you meddling with, stupid?",
  "5748": "Why do you specify the fox?",
  "5749": "Who said that?",
  "5750": "But you have found out something for yourself?",
  "5751": "Well, what if I could?",
  "5752": "Did you bet?",
  "5753": "Are you not weary of that stupid, meaningless, constantly repeated fraud?",
  "5754": "I say, you're not putting off a party tonight, are you?",
  "5755": "Well, then, what'll we make him the ink out of?",
  "5756": "But, bishop, the question is, who has the power to settle it?",
  "5757": "Don't you trust me?",
  "5758": "What does friendship mean if it not so?",
  "5759": "Well, what time for repayment do you wish me to take?",
  "5760": "Whuzzis?",
  "5761": "Why is the hawk so hated by birds?",
  "5762": "About measures, or rhythms, or verses?",
  "5763": "What sort of young woman?",
  "5764": "Do you know where I shall find him?",
  "5765": "I sprung out of bed, and asked, what wreck?",
  "5766": "Are you sure this time?",
  "5767": "Would he have drawn back?",
  "5768": "Had ever a queen such a throne before?",
  "5769": "And what do YOU want?",
  "5770": "Or was he a debtor or a debtor's son?",
  "5771": "Not quite so far, I hope?",
  "5772": "You are not angry with me?",
  "5773": "For what is maintenance?",
  "5774": "What will you?",
  "5775": "What does this mean?",
  "5776": "Go whither?",
  "5777": "Does he not set me at defiance?",
  "5778": "But, after the ball, why had he not returned?",
  "5779": "And where did you hear it?",
  "5780": "What the devil could that handkerchief signify?",
  "5781": "What data could he expect from an uncleaned watch?",
  "5782": "But what is all this about?",
  "5783": "Can't we come?",
  "5784": "And destroy their lives, when they've helped me to remake mine?",
  "5785": "But need we fear anything beyond a momentary anger?",
  "5786": "And which are these two sorts?",
  "5787": "Don't you feel as if you just loved the world on a morning like this?",
  "5788": "To drink?",
  "5789": "What shall we do, then, to push this great war of freedom and justice to its righteous conclusion?",
  "5790": "Will you get the mail, dear?",
  "5791": "Yes, very noble?",
  "5792": "Do you know where I am leading you?",
  "5793": "Did we notify them of this sage view of ours when we borrowed their money?",
  "5794": "Why did you form a monster so hideous that even YOU turned from me in disgust?",
  "5795": "Atone for a fault by paying money?",
  "5796": "How can you build on such a quicksand?",
  "5797": "Is that cough of his better?",
  "5798": "Why does he not look at me?",
  "5799": "From what house does the young noble come?",
  "5800": "But now how stands the wind?",
  "5801": "You promise me that frankness?",
  "5802": "And are you building?",
  "5803": "Would his uncle give him a place in the bank?",
  "5804": "Hearken to me, will you?",
  "5805": "What do you think, would they give us anything for it?",
  "5806": "Do you not know?",
  "5807": "How far does one of these little revolvers carry?",
  "5808": "Shall I seal the door?",
  "5809": "What did you take her?",
  "5810": "Yea, and what work, king's daughter?",
  "5811": "You're going to keep open the proposition, so to speak?",
  "5812": "How long will the air in the reservoirs last for us to breathe on board?",
  "5813": "What have you to offer to me, my friend?",
  "5814": "Why say ye so?",
  "5815": "No doubt you felt this yourself?",
  "5816": "Would he take her back to the beach or would he keep her here?",
  "5817": "Coom, wakken oop, will 'ee?",
  "5818": "And that principle which repels the musical, or the just?",
  "5819": "Why had he withheld life from her?",
  "5820": "And that isn't much, is it?",
  "5821": "Is life grievous to you?",
  "5822": "And are we to be carried on far and away into remote distance, and never, never to return?",
  "5823": "Why do you speak so?",
  "5824": "As for what you do me the honor to say, I presume you mean I was afraid?",
  "5825": "So, why not accept these sports as legitimate expressions of a normal and wholesome human nature?",
  "5826": "Whose camp are you in, those who bless or those who curse?",
  "5827": "Is it my mother?",
  "5828": "What is your opinion of it?",
  "5829": "How in the world did you deduce that?",
  "5830": "Now guess what the young one did?",
  "5831": "What money is there to be made here in any other way?",
  "5832": "But suppose she does come there?",
  "5833": "And was this not to be obtained?",
  "5834": "Your reason, your reason for this?",
  "5835": "And silent all?",
  "5836": "What keeps them dancing till five o'clock in the morning through a whole mortal season?",
  "5837": "What can it be, then?",
  "5838": "Are you aware what you are saying, my lord?",
  "5839": "So much per man?",
  "5840": "What made you go away with him?",
  "5841": "Will all things be set right in the nation?",
  "5842": "Have you informed him of it?",
  "5843": "Don't we all know that it must be a match, that they were over head and ears in love with each other from the first moment they met?",
  "5844": "What is this vessel?",
  "5845": "Would you venture to so consider them had they been committed by any nation on earth against the humblest of our people?",
  "5846": "He?",
  "5847": "But who had made her tell it?",
  "5848": "To get her out of my bride's way, who might otherwise walk over her rather too emphatically?",
  "5849": "What is the best way of living for us monks?",
  "5850": "Was that the reason why you quitted the service, monsieur le chevalier?",
  "5851": "Where were you meaning to spend the evening?",
  "5852": "Come at last where your duty calls you, eh?",
  "5853": "Who will push a drum hither for me?",
  "5854": "D'you think they'll kill us?",
  "5855": "Who has a right to strike her dead?",
  "5856": "Could it be well that she should sacrifice the happiness of two persons to a theoretic love of pure blood?",
  "5857": "She ses to me she ses 'can you show me all them places?",
  "5858": "But how is it that you know so much of these matters?",
  "5859": "Isn't he funny?",
  "5860": "And what is the faculty in man to which imitation is addressed?",
  "5861": "But where do you come from not to know what every coachman in the town knows?",
  "5862": "What is that pain like?",
  "5863": "Drop me in the park, will you?",
  "5864": "When do you wish the carriage to be here?",
  "5865": "Any one dead?",
  "5866": "Have you lost it?",
  "5867": "Isn't that a question for consideration?",
  "5868": "Am I not thy loving father?",
  "5869": "But if you have a genius for painting, would it not be right to take that as a guide?",
  "5870": "PISTHETAERUS D'you see?",
  "5871": "Is that the question?",
  "5872": "A philosopher, perhaps?",
  "5873": "Is it likely?",
  "5874": "May I count upon your assistance?",
  "5875": "Are the eggs nice?",
  "5876": "Of tea with me over the fire?",
  "5877": "And now, my friend, as you cannot come to me, may I come to you?",
  "5878": "Why not today?",
  "5879": "What?",
  "5880": "Will you render me a little help?",
  "5881": "Are you scoffing at me?",
  "5882": "How do you suppose I managed when you were away?",
  "5883": "Is it so, or is it not so?",
  "5884": "If he could mollify the lioness with such a sop, how happy would he think his first efforts had been?",
  "5885": "And are you nervous?",
  "5886": "Do you say no?",
  "5887": "And why may we not continue that ratio far beyond that period?",
  "5888": "In the churchyard?",
  "5889": "And how so, if you please?",
  "5890": "Abdicated?",
  "5891": "Why tell all that?",
  "5892": "And with regard to us, how were you placed?",
  "5893": "Then where is he gone?",
  "5894": "Think of you?",
  "5895": "Or did I only imagine that you did?",
  "5896": "Yet what do we have but words?",
  "5897": "Is't not simply the best that ever you heard, captain?",
  "5898": "Is there any ground for all these questions, or not?",
  "5899": "Linton, don't you recall your cousin, that you used to tease us so with wishing to see?",
  "5900": "Can you satisfy us of that?",
  "5901": "And where does he live?",
  "5902": "If his beauty allures my eyes, and my eyes listen to the call, shall I say that I love him just for that?",
  "5903": "How shall I call her?",
  "5904": "Is that where you belong?",
  "5905": "What child?",
  "5906": "And whence and whither is it now?",
  "5907": "Do I understand you?",
  "5908": "You wrote it?",
  "5909": "What's the old man have so much to do with him for?",
  "5910": "A daughter, I suppose?",
  "5911": "What have you said to your father about all this?",
  "5912": "Is he grateful?",
  "5913": "Didn't I tell yeh so?",
  "5914": "And your precautions were successful?",
  "5915": "Begging your pardon for interrupting you a moment?",
  "5916": "How does one manage to dance through one's heels first?",
  "5917": "Am I so dreadful, so hateful to 'ee?",
  "5918": "But what mischief had the ball committed in its passage?",
  "5919": "What pursuit would I follow?",
  "5920": "Is it a single corporate body?",
  "5921": "Would they not?",
  "5922": "Would you like to write and tell her so?",
  "5923": "Are you not too much shut up?",
  "5924": "Who is't?",
  "5925": "What do you think of the other?",
  "5926": "To go where?",
  "5927": "Was this done on purpose?",
  "5928": "Could she have guessed?",
  "5929": "What course shall we pursue?",
  "5930": "But is it best?",
  "5931": "Then you won't do as I ask you?",
  "5932": "How did you open it before?",
  "5933": "Very sad, is it not?",
  "5934": "Mother, can't you see her?",
  "5935": "What is there in this world more melancholy than such a dinner?",
  "5936": "Why so?",
  "5937": "Well, well, what was it you were going to say about the prince?",
  "5938": "How many are there of them, then?",
  "5939": "Amelia, is it?",
  "5940": "You don't believe that it is so hateful there?",
  "5941": "Has he any children?",

  "6365": "Between the anvil and the hammers?",
  "6366": "Was the duke as civil as ever when you took your leave of him?",
  "6367": "Has your bed been moved since you have been a prisoner?",
  "6368": "Should any one go against it?",
  "6369": "What adventure, what tragedy did this souvenir conceal?",
  "6370": "But how could I bear to be a secondary person with her to whom I had been everything, and who could never cease being such to me?",
  "6371": "Can't you hear me, man?",
  "6372": "And if it came to that, would any of them survive the voyage round the formidable promontory?",
  "6373": "But what do you advise, then?",
  "6374": "Nothing to do with me?",
  "6375": "Whose loot is this, if it is not ours?",
  "6376": "But when shall I see him?",
  "6377": "If that be so, do you see what, on the other hand, is involved in it?",
  "6378": "But have you any grave doubts on the subject?",
  "6379": "And for what were our shields intended?",
  "6380": "How much do you suppose he possesses?",
  "6381": "And is it not?",
  "6382": "Is your sword bewitched, or under the influence of some imperial charm?",
  "6383": "Sister must have taken her, or else where can she be?",
  "6384": "What the deuce are you doing here?",
  "6385": "And old age?",
  "6386": "Would you like to see him?",
  "6387": "Shall I meet other wayfarers at night?",
  "6388": "Scratch you out of her will, I think you mean?",
  "6389": "Have you ever heard that name?",
  "6390": "Don't you see that a single kite could easily carry off the lot at once?",
  "6391": "Why don't you come away?",
  "6392": "Now which is most honourable, the air or the earth?",

  "6424": "If a man gets paid, what more can he want?",
  "6425": "Am n't I converted?",
  "6426": "Has she given you that as a reason?",
  "6427": "What bitter sight have you seen to make you feel such bitterness?",
  "6428": "I come to you, my leader, my head, my father, and I ask you, master, are you contented with me?",
  "6429": "What can authorize him to draw any such inference?",
  "6430": "What have you learnt of her history?",
  "6431": "Why be so upset?",
  "6432": "Isn't there anybody else?",

  "6440": "How does the question of my love come in?",
  "6441": "I ask you whether you will go?",
  "6442": "Would you like to be arrested as his accomplice?",
  "6443": "By whom?",
  "6444": "And what are you doing now?",
  "6445": "What o' devil has he swallowed?",
  "6446": "So you won't let me have him, gen'l'men?",
  "6447": "What good has it done me to mourn for you eternally in the secret recesses of my heart?",
  "6448": "Do you fear he will not understand?",
  "6449": "Why should I bestow all my tediousness upon you, because I have you in my power, and have ink, paper, and time before me?",
  "6450": "But may not there be some occasions, where this may be a little dispensed with?",
  "6451": "My fault, my heart's joy?",
  "6452": "What chance have we now to overtake or even to trace it?",
  "6453": "But who, in sooth, could resist a freshly broiled venison streak eaten out in the open air to the tune of jest and good fellowship?",
  "6454": "Why should one halt on the way?",
  "6455": "Jellyband?",
  "6456": "And can't it be helped?",
  "6457": "Have you?",
  "6458": "Is not that a falsehood?",
  "6459": "I suppose you despise me dreadfully, prince, eh?",
  "6460": "What more does the position admit of?",
  "6461": "Expect to get anything by this evidence?",
  "6462": "How would you like to have it?",
  "6463": "Why does it keep coming up against you in your mind?",
  "6464": "And did not their defeat precipitate the fall of the city?",
  "6465": "Where did he come from?",
  "6466": "What shall become of us at the end, if at the beginning we are lukewarm and idle?",
  "6467": "Do you still feel the same feverish impatience of grief which made you start like a wounded lion?",
  "6468": "Emilie?",
  "6469": "Whence arose thy writhing entrails?",
  "6470": "And if her father doubted her a little, would not neighbours and acquaintance doubt her much?",
  "6471": "What the hell do you know about it?",
  "6472": "And you saw no more of him?",
  "6473": "What on earth is this?",
  "6474": "Was there anything to be learnt from this fine sentence?",
  "6475": "Children dear, was it yesterday?",
  "6476": "Which they deserve, do they not?",
  "6477": "Well, what about my plan?",
  "6478": "And there is no difficulty, he said, in assigning to all of them places answering to their several natures and propensities?",
  "6479": "Are you happy now, you foolish boy?",
  "6480": "Shall we continue to raise our eyes to heaven?",
  "6481": "Now, in what consists the correlation between USEFUL value and value in EXCHANGE?",
  "6482": "Why, madam, think you to mock me thus palpably?",
  "6483": "Are you going so soon?",
  "6484": "I say, is it true that we have been beaten?",
  "6485": "What is the matter with me?",
  "6486": "Do you know where he is?",
  "6487": "Don't I know my man?",
  "6488": "What gentleman?",
  "6489": "And on this oddness, of which the number three has the impress, the opposite idea will never intrude?",
  "6490": "What now?",
  "6491": "Have you gone mad, my dear friend?",
  "6492": "And, if it has no proper place of its own, like the earth, in the midst of its elements, why does it not fall to the centre of our elements?",
  "6493": "Who did the deed?",
  "6494": "Forward, my brave cuirassiers?",
  "6495": "What lack you from us?",
  "6496": "Canst not bide still an instant?",
  "6497": "You know what there is in the letter, father?",
  "6498": "You don't mean honestly she said that?",
  "6499": "Who gave you permission, monsieur to fathom my designs, or to reckon with me?",
  "6500": "But where does the connection come in?",
  "6501": "Put him up?",
  "6502": "By what authority does he declare all this meritless?",
  "6503": "Can you tell me his exact height?",
  "6504": "And what is their temper now?",
  "6505": "Emeralds?",
  "6506": "But how now?",
  "6507": "Do I know that photograph?",
  "6508": "How then shall I be able to find you, when the day of payment comes?",
  "6509": "Who is there to tell that I am the murderer?",

  "6511": "How farewell?",
  "6512": "Wasn't that delicious?",
  "6513": "You're quite strong now?",
  "6514": "And the paper on the walls?",
  "6515": "Send for you at this time of night?",
  "6516": "Is it far?",
  "6517": "Have you the money he demands?",
  "6518": "You wouldn't think so to look at me, would you?",
  "6519": "Fie, fie, nephew, you would not pull off your boots here?",
  "6520": "Why should we be more fastidious and severe than they were?",
  "6521": "What you been doing down there?",
  "6522": "But your father?",
  "6523": "Shall I see him marry her?",
  "6524": "Why are you crying, father?",
  "6525": "Do you think it can?",
  "6526": "And leave the east end to starve?",
  "6527": "Everything cackleth, but who will still sit quietly on the nest and hatch eggs?",
  "6528": "How can I join in?",
  "6529": "What time did it appear?",
  "6530": "What bark?",
  "6531": "You don't mean as the crooks have got her?",
  "6532": "What is the meaning of it all?",
  "6533": "And what excuse did she give you for entering all alone?",
  "6534": "Besides, what use was my hair to me?",
  "6535": "What CAN I do?",
  "6536": "Now, sire, what shall I do with respect to the finances?",
  "6537": "But if the bridge is crossed it means that the army too is lost?",
  "6538": "What's all this show of cutlasses?",
  "6539": "And how shall I be dressed?",

  "6543": "On'y, where are they?",
  "6544": "Are not all things which have opposites generated out of their opposites?",
  "6545": "That's a good sign, isn't it?",
  "6546": "But don't you think that's very wicked?",
  "6547": "By the way, how long do you think this war will last?",
  "6548": "What shall I say, my dear father and mother, to this unexpected declaration?",
  "6549": "YOU'LL bring your threats here, will you?",
  "6550": "And would you rather die, than obey your father?",
  "6551": "Going to?",
  "6552": "To hang your hat on?",
  "6553": "Whom have I the honour to address?",
  "6554": "And what will you do?",

  "6556": "But could I not see her where she is?",
  "6557": "If so that, then what about the others?",
  "6558": "Is it so bad then?",
  "6559": "You don't know where she is?",
  "6560": "What do you want?",
  "6561": "And, besides, does not everything serve me?",
  "6562": "Boivin?",
  "6563": "Do you think it's a refuge for fools?",
  "6564": "Was he, after all, to be just a moment too late?",
  "6565": "You are simply repeating all you said in your letter, and what's the use?",
  "6566": "Or, will you not stay and forget what you have said?",
  "6567": "You mean that he has a great income and that he must earn it in an illegal fashion?",
  "6568": "Oh, did he?",
  "6569": "Do you call me a fool?",
  "6570": "You think that he is dead?",
  "6571": "Who shall settle the terms of peace, and in case of disputes what umpire shall decide between them and compel acquiescence?",
  "6572": "Is this the decanter you spoke of?",
  "6573": "Arrested him?",
  "6574": "This early trial of yours that is fit to make your little heart burst, and your very eyes come out of your head with crying, what is it?",
  "6575": "Was she to go back?",
  "6576": "Say whether you have any objection to urge against those of us who regulate marriage?",
  "6577": "You don't mean that you know where he is?",
  "6578": "What says the bard?",
  "6579": "Why, too, have I given such heed to others?",

  "6585": "Why, surely you're a member of the board?",
  "6586": "The news?",
  "6587": "Why is it not done already?",
  "6588": "And you conspire with him against me, do you, viper?",
  "6589": "But what can I make her about herself?",
  "6590": "A peerage in her own right?",
  "6591": "What happiness can you give her as your wife?",
  "6592": "And a man will be most likely to care about that which he loves?",
  "6593": "What about it, eh?",
  "6594": "Are you drunk or mad, my masters?",
  "6595": "What do you mean by not saying anything instead of taking my part?",
  "6596": "Was he not simply another of the countless wild things of the jungle who preyed upon one another to satisfy the cravings of hunger?",
  "6597": "Supposing, after all, she's escaped?",
  "6598": "You recollect perfectly all I have told you, do you not?",
  "6599": "Didn't I tell you to insist on having a proper advocate?",
  "6600": "You, then, who put your hands to the work, who alone truly create, why do you wish me to admit your inferiority?",
  "6601": "Don't the cards tell you, that he is dead?",
  "6602": "Then why doesn't she choose, when I tell her of what consequence it is?",
  "6603": "But if he is innocent, who has done it?",
  "6604": "A religious book, uncle?",
  "6605": "Shall you come again, doctor?",
  "6606": "It wouldn't be nice to have something wrong in your upper story, would it, teacher?",
  "6607": "What, with the baroness?",
  "6608": "How did you come to separate yourself from the pigs and chickens?",
  "6609": "Is it because there is a difference in size?",
  "6610": "If you object to the testimony of the chief person present, in what way are we to obtain evidence?",
  "6611": "Are there any quail left now?",
  "6612": "Three figures?",

  "6622": "And you have heard him?",
  "6623": "And what's this new building?",
  "6624": "Did he say that I was to give you anything?",
  "6625": "Have you more than one clerk, you parrot, that you ask the question?",
  "6626": "Is't not strange?",
  "6627": "And that's your notion of harshness?",
  "6628": "Have you breakfasted?",
  "6629": "Will you not come with me?",
  "6630": "Dine together?",
  "6631": "Are not all these things evident proofs of a fixed and uniform plan to tax us?",
  "6632": "Would he send that out and have his men take it as the truth?",
  "6633": "But tell me, why do the people admire me?",
  "6634": "What perverted genius controls this awful secret movement?",
  "6635": "May I look?",
  "6636": "How are your children?",
  "6637": "Would you a reader's just esteem engage?",
  "6638": "What, the whole of it?",

  "6641": "What else could I do?",
  "6642": "And you would have married her?",
  "6643": "WILL IT HIT US?",
  "6644": "Is it an ill expression?",
  "6645": "Will it satisfy them if, in the future, we have nothing to do with invasions and, insurrections?",
  "6646": "Will you wait for me and we can lunch somewhere together?",
  "6647": "Why do you laugh?",
  "6648": "Could his mind then not trust itself?",
  "6649": "Now what ought I to do?",
  "6650": "Are there not as many prizes as there are competitors?",
  "6651": "The same man as the preacher?",
  "6652": "Do you think it is poisoned?",
  "6653": "You are well enough to go out, aren't you?",
  "6654": "What profits it to call ill deeds to mind?",
  "6655": "Then how do you account for the mud on the axle?",
  "6656": "And those two silvery fish?",
  "6657": "Where did you break your glasses?",
  "6658": "Indeed, if a little knowledge is dangerous, where is the man who has so much as to be out of danger?",
  "6659": "And you would arrest him?",
  "6660": "Conditions?",
  "6661": "Now, who is that?",
  "6662": "But where was it he learnt his art?",
  "6663": "You would like to be a lady?",
  "6664": "That's your opinion, eh?",
  "6665": "Paul, is there any truth in this?",
  "6666": "He saw me, did he, the rascal?",
  "6667": "Whose latter days had ever been more blessed than his?",
  "6668": "What did they say to each other?",
  "6669": "Has your experience been as a practitioner, or rather as an investigator of medicine as a science?",
  "6670": "How many of us are there?",
  "6671": "Do you know how he died?",
  "6672": "And when shall we get there?",
  "6673": "Will you or will you not answer for your unmanly and brutal conduct?",
  "6674": "Of what country am I?",
  "6675": "Who is the man over there?",
  "6676": "Do you call it very bad?",
  "6677": "Where did she come from?",
  "6678": "Why are you smiling?",
  "6679": "Is this the lane?",
  "6680": "And yet, I wonder whether there was not a little feeling of melancholy in the midst of all our joy?",
  "6681": "Are you alone?",
  "6682": "Was it water?",
  "6683": "Is it fraudulent to aromatize, alcoholize, and water wines?",
  "6684": "But what has he said to you?",
  "6685": "And yet why?",
  "6686": "And what's to become of me?",

  "6690": "Shall I ride up to the house a few minutes hence, innocently supposing that its master is at home and will be charmed to receive me?",
  "6691": "But who can say what that limit will be?",
  "6692": "You can't mean to go yet?",
  "6693": "Father, what do you want me to do with it?",
  "6694": "Where am I to go?",

  "6696": "WOULD he tell me why?",
  "6697": "What will be the good of that?",
  "6698": "How long has he known of this?",
  "6699": "Shall I get into it?",
  "6700": "But we'll try, shall we?",
  "6701": "Twas but now you left me after an unwonted measure of enjoyment, and do you now return so soon?",
  "6702": "What, even for me?",
  "6703": "Who is this young butcher?",
  "6704": "How is this possible?",
  "6705": "And is this confined to the sight only, or does it extend to the hearing also, relating in fact to what we term poetry?",
  "6706": "Anything the matter?",
  "6707": "I could, therefore, expect a higher rank, and who knows what might have happened had the elder branch remained on the throne?",

  "6721": "About jam?",
  "6722": "So you can see that there was a 'scene,' can you?",
  "6723": "You are positive?",
  "6724": "Why, then, has society recognized a right injurious to itself, where there is no producing cause?",
  "6725": "I must go thither tonight?",

  "6756": "Well, and have they ceased to exist?",
  "6757": "Is it not odd?",
  "6758": "What is it, my master?",
  "6759": "How can you do such a thing?",
  "6760": "Had I not just better tell him I have found it, and pretend I never guessed where it was?",
  "6761": "If the body and mind of man are products of evolution, must we not admit as much of man's moral intuitions?",

  "6784": "And what have you been doing?",
  "6785": "Where's there a fire?",
  "6786": "To exhibit one's folly in order to mock at one's wisdom?",

  "6815": "Is that the woman?",
  "6816": "I suppose he does his work?",
  "6817": "You do not intend, I suppose, to make her your mistress?",

  "6858": "To being in love?",
  "6859": "What is the young man's own account of the matter?",
  "6860": "Well, but what should you do?",
  "6861": "What terms shall we find which have not been already exhausted?",
  "6862": "Can he do otherwise?",
  "6863": "Where were you going?",
  "6864": "And do you not blush to own it?",
  "6865": "For whom?",
  "6866": "A poor blind man, whom you will have to lead about by the hand?",
  "6867": "Why should anyone desire to steal it or to publish it?",
  "6868": "I suppose you are wondering what it's all about?",
  "6869": "Are you leaving me thus?",
  "6870": "Surely you must be dull in the country in the winter, aren't you?",
  "6871": "Some time, then?",
  "6872": "What do you command?",

  "6881": "What idea in fact could he have?",
  "6882": "Why on earth don't you do so?",
  "6883": "Honest injun, you ain't a ghost?",
  "6884": "And now what had we better do?",
  "6885": "Are you the one I met on the beach?",
  "6886": "But do you imagine that the story of the watch ended there?",
  "6887": "Do people marry whom they like?",
  "6888": "Is this what we pay rates for?",
  "6889": "Is it a secret?",
  "6890": "Is she her mother?",
  "6891": "Shall oppressed humanity find no asylum on this globe?",
  "6892": "Did she seem to be one of the tribe, or was she a prisoner?",
  "6893": "It appears that our journey was a remounting journey, then?",
  "6894": "Are not all bodies subject throughout their mass to the power of universal attraction?",
  "6895": "Whatever cannot ye keep yourself for, then?",
  "6896": "What was the purpose of this journey and what did it accomplish?",
  "6897": "Or what inducement has the manufacturer?",

  "6908": "I hope you are not going to leave me?",
  "6909": "You are returning, perhaps, to your duty?",
  "6910": "But they are all in order, you say?",
  "6911": "What about an official visit?",
  "6912": "And you know nothing of his present situation?",
  "6913": "What's the matter with 'em?",
  "6914": "And why was he thus anxious?",
  "6915": "You heard nothing?",
  "6916": "What did she say?",
  "6917": "Don't you recognize the man?",
  "6918": "What made you change from the nice business your father left you?",
  "6919": "What's the matter with her?",
  "6920": "When I calculated that this impetuous young woman would overdo it in new directions, was I wrong or right?",
  "6921": "Are conditions necessary with me, monsieur?",
  "6922": "Are you in love with HER?",
  "6923": "And passes his time?",
  "6924": "Why do you shout like that?",
  "6925": "You do not think of going?",
  "6926": "But what makes the end agreeable?",
  "6927": "An't it beautiful?",
  "6928": "How'm I to get out of it?",
  "6929": "What good star brings you here?",
  "6930": "Why should they not aim at a common literature, and bring their various common laws, their marriage laws, and so on, into uniformity?",
  "6931": "How is that, count?",
  "6932": "Don't you see what a cropper we would have come if she hadn't settled down as she has?",
  "6933": "But whither are we bound?",
  "6934": "O, good cousin, I am a little busy, how does my niece?",
  "6935": "How can you ask me if I am listening?",
  "6936": "What does he think of it all?",
  "6937": "To whom is this accorded?",
  "6938": "Sleep?",
  "6939": "Is the security sufficient?",
  "6940": "Is it thirst of gold?",
  "6941": "Be turnd off?",
  "6942": "NOT connected?",
  "6943": "Besides, was he not as ugly as ever?",
  "6944": "What do you suppose?",
  "6945": "And you say that you are ignorant of the contents of this letter?",
  "6946": "Him?",
  "6947": "What is a surprise?",
  "6948": "Is there a moon?",
  "6949": "But what will be reported of the sudden death of the poor old servant?",
  "6950": "How could I tell?",
  "6951": "Is't right?",
  "6952": "What became of the seven children?",
  "6953": "What shall I be if she becomes my wife?",
  "6954": "Uncle?",
  "6955": "And were you?",
  "6956": "Why am I angry with him, do you ask, my mother?",
  "6957": "Oh, do you really think so?",
  "6958": "Now, have I your permission to go?",
  "6959": "Could you not repeat it for me?",
  "6960": "So he cherishes no resentment?",
  "6961": "Still on foot?",
  "6962": "Then why did he purchase it?",
  "6963": "Yes, please?",
  "6964": "Won't you?",
  "6965": "Is it that she cannot or that she will not express what she feels and thinks?",
  "6966": "The whole of it?",
  "6967": "Who does now?",
  "6968": "Is that you, dear friend?",
  "6969": "Where can you get any and how can you get it?",
  "6970": "Well, what did I say?",
  "6971": "And what manner of government do you term oligarchy?",
  "6972": "At farthest?",
  "6973": "No, why so?",
  "6974": "But, papa, where will the matron live?",
  "6975": "Who besides me has met that long look of love that has burnt itself into my soul, so that no other image can come there?",
  "6976": "Will you tell us one thing?",
  "6977": "How would he open the door for me?",
  "6978": "How can I take her away now, when I have no money?",
  "6979": "And is there no means of making him revoke his decision?",
  "6980": "But why was this affection distressed?",
  "6981": "You believe in glory, then?",
  "6982": "How's the cows?",
  "6983": "What is the day, daughter?",
  "6984": "Do you want an honest answer?",
  "6985": "And asking, why?",
  "6986": "By that flue?",
  "6987": "That's all you think of me, is it?",
  "6988": "Will you come and look at 'im and see it's all right?",
  "6989": "You don't know?",
  "6990": "Is he not flesh of her flesh and bone of her bone, and must he not so continue?",
  "6991": "All that was plainly in your orders, all that was well executed, very punctually, was it not?",
  "6992": "And why has the count bought a rock?",
  "6993": "So you liked my song?",
  "6994": "Why are taxes paid?",
  "6995": "May I ask what you were doing there?",
  "6996": "What is that?",
  "6997": "We're not the meek?",
  "6998": "Why stand ye there?",
  "6999": "Should you have gone to her then?",
  "7000": "Where else should I go?",
  "7001": "Now, what's he speaking about, and who's he speaking to, I should like to know?",
  "7002": "Or where was he?",
  "7003": "Heather on fire?",
  "7004": "If one's not to live together, what's the use of marrying?",
  "7005": "Why not the simpler way?",
  "7006": "But you do not understand any of the peals?",
  "7007": "What cart?",
  "7008": "Isn't she ripe now?",
  "7009": "But what do you intend to do?",
  "7010": "Where's your brother?",
  "7011": "I come for my girl, see?",
  "7012": "Do you then make nothing at all of her having been so ready to leave us?",
  "7013": "For what do good men who make the best soldiers fight?",
  "7014": "What is your last name again, say you?",
  "7015": "They haven't anything, have they?",
  "7016": "Is it me you want?",
  "7017": "And this lady?",
  "7018": "Object to him, guardian?",
  "7019": "Who sent it me?",
  "7020": "You've not heard?",
  "7021": "What can you do with a man like that?",
  "7022": "Do these animals possess a power of communicating with each other?",
  "7023": "Well, but wasn't it the most fortunate thing in the world?",
  "7024": "Will you never learn?",
  "7025": "Do you live here in the city?",
  "7026": "Shouldn't we light a lantern?",
  "7027": "What was the relation between them, and what the object of his repeated visits?",
  "7028": "You mistrust me, then, master pedant, do you?",
  "7029": "Was ever the like?",
  "7030": "Does not this little book clear up the mystery of your parentage?",
  "7031": "If the news is not to be bad why have our weapons been taken from us?",
  "7032": "Can't I go away from here, run away, bury myself somewhere?",
  "7033": "Else why should he talk about his 'twenty minutes past' and about his having no watch to tell the time by?",
  "7034": "More?",
  "7035": "Or doth the animal speak in thy wish, and necessity?",
  "7036": "Who sends you?",
  "7037": "Can you, ma'am?",
  "7038": "Who can 'scape his bow?",
  "7039": "Of course you agree to have a battle?",
  "7040": "Do you stay here long?",
  "7041": "From whom?",
  "7042": "I do not address her brother?",
  "7043": "Are we then going to travel, my lord?",
  "7044": "And to whom would this document be sent if it fell into the hands of an enemy?",
  "7045": "Charlotte and I?",
  "7046": "What's the good of our going away together?",
  "7047": "Cake?",
  "7048": "O, whither I?",
  "7049": "Why did you not accept it?",
  "7050": "And does he know about the rosette?",
  "7051": "Ah, but what is the matter with your hand, d'Artagnan?",
  "7052": "You've not done right, have you, now?",
  "7053": "Do you hear me, you fairy spirit?",
  "7054": "Is history to be written from such documents?",
  "7055": "Is what this paper says, the truth?",
  "7056": "And can you forget so soon what I proposed to you the other night?",
  "7057": "But, madame, what can he do, unless he has a kingdom to back him?",
  "7058": "Where was my son?",
  "7059": "But does not the present case fairly constitute an exception?",
  "7060": "English money?",
  "7061": "How could she extricate herself from this labyrinth?",
  "7062": "But what shall we do now?",
  "7063": "Know you of what materials some hearts are made?",
  "7064": "This other gentleman is in the preaching line, I think?",
  "7065": "The count has the message?",
  "7066": "What's her trump card?",
  "7067": "She is not another man's wife, and it appears that she has married me according to the custom of this awful place, so who is the worse?",
  "7068": "Gracious goodness, and who's to make my chocolate?",
  "7069": "Why, what class are they?",
  "7070": "Can I have fifty?",
  "7071": "Would it not be a sweet revenge for him when he found that I had not died from the blow of his dagger?",
  "7072": "They will not blunder?",
  "7073": "Why do I say this?",
  "7074": "Can you read?",
  "7075": "And you are disposed to serve the cause of the people?",
  "7076": "Do you or don't you?",
  "7077": "But how shall I prevent his departure, if that should turn out to be my last resource?",
  "7078": "Wonder how old he is?",
  "7079": "You prefer not to perhaps?",
  "7080": "Are you?",
  "7081": "And could you see if my brother is here, and send him to me?",
  "7082": "And if he chances to return again?",
  "7083": "Oh, you mean commercially?",
  "7084": "Will you tell me?",
  "7085": "From whence do these papers come, you say?",
  "7086": "Will you take the time from me?",
  "7087": "And the reason why the good are useless has now been explained?",
  "7088": "P'raps you might be writin' to her?",
  "7089": "At what point shall I begin my story, your excellency?",
  "7090": "Who knows what unhappiness may not be lurking for me, ready to spring at any moment?",

  "7093": "What ones?",
  "7094": "What is the percentage?",
  "7095": "What responsibilities?",
  "7096": "You mean that the person will come again?",

  "7099": "Why were they so desirous of having me for their host?",
  "7100": "Had I overrated the importance of the discovery?",
  "7101": "At this time o' night, and such a night?",
  "7102": "Where an the sweetmeats?",
  "7103": "So you know his name?",
  "7104": "What is to be done with him?",
  "7105": "What on earth for?",
  "7106": "Don't you know father better than that by this time?",
  "7107": "Tell me who made the world?",
  "7108": "Is he one of your acquaintance?",
  "7109": "Are you awfully unhappy?",
  "7110": "What, then, is the matter with them?",
  "7111": "But you can dance?",
  "7112": "Do we not make our livings by doing nought of any good?",
  "7113": "Is he never robbed?",
  "7114": "Andrea?",
  "7115": "Father, why have you thus incens'd them both?",
  "7116": "Why am I not to talk about it?",
  "7117": "Then, how did it happen?",
  "7118": "Don't you hear the hammer at work?",
  "7119": "Is the team harnessed?",
  "7120": "Can you read this language?",
  "7121": "He?",
  "7122": "Who do you like best downstairs?",
  "7123": "Will you be a little more explicit?",
  "7124": "Suppose he were in a railway train, would they stop it for him?",
  "7125": "Can we afford to sin any more deeply against human liberty?",
  "7126": "Might it not be better simply to buy up the editorial staff?",
  "7127": "And who was the winner?",
  "7128": "After all, what does it matter?",
  "7129": "You will?",
  "7130": "What reason have you to be morose?",
  "7131": "Are you telling the truth when you say you are not in love?",
  "7132": "And why is it?",
  "7133": "Susan, you agree?",
  "7134": "Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me?",
  "7135": "Must they give him up?",
  "7136": "Did he kill anybody?",
  "7137": "Why should I take you for him?",
  "7138": "Would you be pleased to walk into the garden?",
  "7139": "Especially as at that time we didn't know one another quite so well as we do now, did we, dear?",
  "7140": "Then why venture there?",
  "7141": "Is she very angry with me?",
  "7142": "Yes what?",
  "7143": "In what way?",
  "7144": "And why is that chronique the elaborately absurd set of legends which we find in all mythologies?",
  "7145": "But why do you not go to the inn?",
  "7146": "A prisoner?",
  "7147": "Are there reasons?",
  "7148": "Is there, indeed, my good fellow?",
  "7149": "Is it your habit to swear much in talking?",
  "7150": "What became of your magic tools?",
  "7151": "You have been resident in my house three months?",
  "7152": "How can we best do it?",
  "7153": "How many of us are here?",
  "7154": "May I ask, in the meanwhile, whether you have yourself any theory to account for this young man's disappearance?",
  "7155": "Have not I, the king, the right to ask of you all that?",
  "7156": "Don't you want to tidy yourself?",
  "7157": "What is the matter in the crowd behind us?",
  "7158": "What made you ask him that?",
  "7159": "Go away?",
  "7160": "And who were the enemy?",
  "7161": "But why any proclamation now upon this subject?",
  "7162": "You'll soon have plenty to do now, dear, won't you?",
  "7163": "One only?",
  "7164": "How about it, then?",
  "7165": "Do you see, stupid?",
  "7166": "How dare you remind me of that horrid dinner party, when yours is so nice in every way?",
  "7167": "Are you fond of it?",
  "7168": "Back?",
  "7169": "Who could entreat a child to desert her parent?",

  "7180": "What do YOU think of when you go mooning about alone?",
  "7181": "Perhaps you didn't know that he was clean ruined?",
  "7182": "Does he know that you are as big an infidel as he?",
  "7183": "Are you going with him?",
  "7184": "Did he come himself, or send over a deputy?",
  "7185": "Is it the principle of knowledge or of goodness, or the union of the two?",
  "7186": "Did you believe that I should go with no farewell to those who haf been so heavenly kind to me?",
  "7187": "Was the mission one in which gentleness would be possible?",
  "7188": "For what purpose do you put such a question to me?",
  "7189": "And what concern is that of mine?",
  "7190": "His financial position?",

  "7196": "Did he?",
  "7197": "But upon what did we rest the creations of our genius?",
  "7198": "Would you recognize him if you saw him again?",

  "7206": "Splendid?",
  "7207": "What does the twilight matter?",
  "7208": "In the centre?",
  "7209": "And it would be a disgrace to marry so, eh?",
  "7210": "NOW, where are these imminent dangers?",
  "7211": "Or, meeting so, why did we not part as strangers?",
  "7212": "What would papa say to that?",
  "7213": "Does she know that you mean to marry her?",
  "7214": "Would she tack about in the bay to pick up stray coasters as prizes, or would she land soldiers to burn the town?",
  "7215": "Do you mean to say that anyone would be mug enough to part with solid cash just to shake hands with my uncle?",
  "7216": "Eternal sorrows what avails to shed?",
  "7217": "How have you spent the day?",
  "7218": "Why could you not simply go away from here, instead of writing me those absurd letters?",

  "7223": "What are you driving at there?",
  "7224": "What is the meaning of that old stone I have passed?",
  "7225": "But do I think so meanly of you as to suppose that that earnestness is about me personally?",
  "7226": "Did you ever know anything so disappointing?",
  "7227": "How did he know all this?",
  "7228": "What regiment?",
  "7229": "Is that so much that he deserves this praise?",
  "7230": "How did he get there with a child?",
  "7231": "And you reply?",
  "7232": "Do you not admire her?",
  "7233": "Bids she not to be wary?",

  "7237": "You will take me on board, count, will you not?",
  "7238": "What's he doing here?",
  "7239": "Is there one of my brethren in whom you have equal confidence with myself?",
  "7240": "What's the rent?",
  "7241": "Like a demd native?",
  "7242": "What for, sire?",

  "7252": "Don't you with pleasure, my dear, said he, take in the delightful fragrance that this sweet shower has given to these banks of flowers?",
  "7253": "Shifts she thus?",
  "7254": "Pay him?",
  "7255": "What flood?",
  "7256": "Is it a man you seen?",
  "7257": "Do you believe that?",
  "7258": "But how does that come about?",
  "7259": "Can we do aught to assist the wretched man?",
  "7260": "Did he say when the battles are to begin?",

  "7262": "How do you know?",
  "7263": "What greater luck could he have than to be brought safely home to his father?",
  "7264": "Or is your brain really unhinged?",
  "7265": "And what was then his conduct?",
  "7266": "So you've come, you rascal?",
  "7267": "Is it not truly to ransom prisoners?",
  "7268": "But does that part of the body understand or what?",

  "7270": "Do you despair now?",
  "7271": "What, I say, is to become of those wretches?",
  "7272": "Do you know that I am growing old?",
  "7273": "How then is it that those people pretend to reject reason?",
  "7274": "Why doesn't he get away?",
  "7275": "Did I say, a few days since, that I had nothing to do with him but to receive my salary at his hands?",
  "7276": "And to what end can it serve either for the service of mankind, or for my own private interest?",
  "7277": "In the few hours that I can possibly allow to elapse before I publish the truth, how is he to be found by us, and only by us?",
  "7278": "Will you have a glass of brandy?",
  "7279": "And fetch him where?",
  "7280": "You know?",
  "7281": "Not crush that accursed race?",
  "7282": "Our conversation yesterday?",
  "7283": "But won't you take one look at him, first, miss?",
  "7284": "An' it ain't much t' ask, is it?",
  "7285": "Williams?",
  "7286": "Why did she not wait till the morrow?",
  "7287": "Where did she pick up this companion?",
  "7288": "Why, don't you see what's happened?",
  "7289": "Then it's NOT postponed?",
  "7290": "Then why don't you die?",
  "7291": "Now are you both ready?",
  "7292": "And those hands, pale and inert, lying on the coverlet before him, could they be his own?",
  "7293": "Oh, is he going to take you for a nice drive?",
  "7294": "Surely not let them go unpunished?",
  "7295": "Is that true?",
  "7296": "And aren't we going to?",
  "7297": "What is it, on the other hand, that makes the lawyer eschew his own cause, and call in his learned brother as an adviser?",
  "7298": "You know, monseigneur, we set out in search of our comrades?",
  "7299": ", or to go about and beg?",
  "7300": "But don't you want to be?",
  "7301": "Yes, miss?",
  "7302": "Somebody else?",
  "7303": "You don't mean that, I am sure?",
  "7304": "In the king's service?",
  "7305": "Why, what is important?",
  "7306": "Where are you living?",
  "7307": "But what is straightforward?",
  "7308": "Have you left your liver behind you?",
  "7309": "Was he not holy enough or why could he not catch up on the others?",
  "7310": "Does that mean you'll come?",
  "7311": "Please do this for me, will you?",
  "7312": "What's amiss?",
  "7313": "Was it imbecility or craft?",
  "7314": "Did its orbit correspond with the orbit of the ecliptic?",
  "7315": "The one to the joint venture?",
  "7316": "Again?",
  "7317": "Beautiful?",
  "7318": "How the devil can you expect to digest food, that you neither take the trouble to dissect, nor time to masticate?",
  "7319": "What mischief can there be in any village, or in all the cities of the world, you booby, that can hurt my reputation?",
  "7320": "What would you have, my dear fellow?",
  "7321": "Hasn't he money?",
  "7322": "What is the process?",
  "7323": "Who could speak to him?",
  "7324": "But who perpetrated that joke, let me ask?",
  "7325": "Is there any difficulty in the way?",
  "7326": "Where will their insolence stop?",
  "7327": "Is this aggression?",
  "7328": "Which of the two will hurl the other over?",
  "7329": "Did she ever talk of revisiting the place?",
  "7330": "You suspect some one?",
  "7331": "What has been decided?",
  "7332": "You shall stay here, do you hear?",
  "7333": "What's become of the boy?",
  "7334": "Where could he?",
  "7335": "Was it even a union in love and goodness?",
  "7336": "And what's six weeks of it?",
  "7337": "Why must you needs go up and change your coat like that?",
  "7338": "What greater misery could heaven inflict?",
  "7339": "I suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers?",
  "7340": "What are the circumstances?",
  "7341": "Am I to wait in the court, sir?",
  "7342": "After you first came to me to get your precious grandson packed off to sea?",
  "7343": "How's this now, kimmer?",
  "7344": "Is there anything the matter?",
  "7345": "A warning for himself?",
  "7346": "To sit?",
  "7347": "What was she being tried for?",
  "7348": "What are those two words, and what is their meaning?",
  "7349": "Do you admire that sort of woman, prince?",
  "7350": "Would this afternoon be inconvenient?",
  "7351": "When are we going to have the marriage?",
  "7352": "Is I ME, or who IS I?",
  "7353": "Does not the boar break cover just when you're lighting a weed?",
  "7354": "When you hear a name pronounced can't you always see it in your mind, just as if it was printed out?",
  "7355": "Aren't you bucked?",
  "7356": "And have you had any shooting yet this year?",
  "7357": "Wait a minute, would you mind?",
  "7358": "What evil memory is this?",
  "7359": "For what is bombast but a force of expression too great for the magnitude of the ideas embodied?",
  "7360": "Couldn't you take your son, and still leave him?",
  "7361": "At what hour?",
  "7362": "About how much?",
  "7363": "May we inquire what is this recipe?",
  "7364": "Now, darling, what shall we do?",
  "7365": "You have quite turned his head, and why?",
  "7366": "Has it been proved?",
  "7367": "And do you often go out?",
  "7368": "What will break the enchantment of animation?",
  "7369": "What's that you are saying to me?",
  "7370": "What, are you no longer in possession of your senses?",
  "7371": "Is it a note?",
  "7372": "Now, what sum have you about you?",
  "7373": "Is it your bashfulness, said he, or your obstinacy, that makes you not choose I should read it before you?",
  "7374": "But how, then, could he have known my reply if it had been in the negative?",
  "7375": "Might I ask in which direction you are going?",
  "7376": "But tell me where is he?",
  "7377": "Do the days when you sat at your mother's knee, seem days of very long ago?",
  "7378": "And before hunting them mercilessly, you would not wait until they had committed some fresh act of hostility against us?",
  "7379": "How could things have taken such a violent turn, and so quickly?",
  "7380": "Where does she live?",
  "7381": "What's the strength of the enemy behind that ridge?",
  "7382": "Why stand you distant, nor attempt a deed?",
  "7383": "Are our lackeys sufficiently devoted to us to risk their lives for us?",

  "7385": "How do you feed him?",
  "7386": "Because I want to know in which of the three classes you would place justice?",
  "7387": "Had he not gained a great victory, and was it not fit that he should step into his cab with triumph?",
  "7388": "You have news to impart?",
  "7389": "And wheres the duke?",
  "7390": "You live near us, don't you?",
  "7391": "But what is the use of asking a jellyfish to sit up straight?",
  "7392": "You don't surely mean to say you're going to leave us here?",
  "7393": "What does he like then?",
  "7394": "Why is this the goal of life?",
  "7395": "What's the name?",
  "7396": "What could I say?",
  "7397": "If there is any better place for such things, where is it?",
  "7398": "Is this thy body's end?",
  "7399": "I wonder what we'll do when we get to the moon?",
  "7400": "What do you desire about it?",
  "7401": "How does it feel to be going away?",
  "7402": "We are good friends, aren't we?",
  "7403": "Are you afraid of one man?",
  "7404": "Can't you tell us?",
  "7405": "You mean that someone waded across the moat?",
  "7406": "But have we any right to assume that things have thus remained from eternity?",
  "7407": "How should we do?",
  "7408": "And had ye ony sister?",
  "7409": "How do you expect to manage the balloon?",
  "7410": "Who is coming here so early in the morning?",
  "7411": "Why, surely he has not changed his mind about marrying?",
  "7412": "I should like to know upon what occasion?",
  "7413": "Am I falling?",
  "7414": "But what is it, CHERIE?",
  "7415": "What's the use of my getting well?",
  "7416": "What is the use of that?",
  "7417": "He had great confidence in my opinion, and what did I think?",
  "7418": "Joy?",
  "7419": "Do I perceive the man whom I see, when I look into a mirror, to be behind the mirror or in front of it?",
  "7420": "Where's your aunt, miss?",
  "7421": "Then you prefer to go to the temples?",
  "7422": "Is he on his own or is he entirely in with them?",
  "7423": "Why grieve?",
  "7424": "Did you recognize your coachman?",
  "7425": "And this is the little girl you have adopted, I suppose?",
  "7426": "Hear ye?",
  "7427": "What's the next?",
  "7428": "Were you waiting for me?",
  "7429": "This very instant?",
  "7430": "But who can endure to be wedded to a dish?",
  "7431": "Go and where shall I find you?",
  "7432": "Will he return this evening?",
  "7433": "Not when you are with me?",
  "7434": "Is he at home?",
  "7435": "Shall I e'er forget it, mun?",
  "7436": "Do you hate it?",
  "7437": "How a wedding present?",
  "7438": "What else?",
  "7439": "And he was alone in achieving an enterprise like that?",
  "7440": "Why has she refused him?",
  "7441": "Why is there an allusion to that cursed 'poor knight' in the anonymous letter?",
  "7442": "Didn't he get the telegram?",
  "7443": "Don't you call to mind what he says?",
  "7444": "And what sort of young lady is she?",
  "7445": "Has a duplicate key been found in his possession?",
  "7446": "Didn't you feel the ground shake?",
  "7447": "How will you travel?",
  "7448": "How many did they say?",
  "7449": "You are not convinced yet?",
  "7450": "Have you provided yourself with money?",
  "7451": "I'm rather on the spot this evening, eh?",
  "7452": "Did she see you?",
  "7453": "Do people die of it?",
  "7454": "I suppose there is nothing to prevent it?",
  "7455": "Did not my neck glitter with diamonds?",
  "7456": "How comes it?",
  "7457": "How otherwise should I have been bad enough?",
  "7458": "You do not reply?",
  "7459": "Then would you call injustice malignity?",
  "7460": "Which will conquer?",
  "7461": "Well, what did the king say?",
  "7462": "Are you sure you're quite so much as six foot three?",
  "7463": "And why, may I ask?",
  "7464": "But we have grain belonging to my brother?",
  "7465": "Do ye love brandy?",
  "7466": "I've given you all the clothes you wanted, haven't I?",
  "7467": "Is that so, sir?",
  "7468": "What course would then have been left to him?",
  "7469": "Do you hear that baggage?",
  "7470": "Must believe?",
  "7471": "How should I know, my dear?",
  "7472": "Why should its existence be prolonged one hour?",
  "7473": "If the prince knew propriety, who does not know it?",
  "7474": "Now, we ask, what was there in this cave to cause a departure from the ordinary course of nature?",
  "7475": "What's the matter aloft there?",
  "7476": "Should war break out in any of those countries who can foretell the extent to which it may be carried or the desolation which it may spread?",
  "7477": "Quite certain?",
  "7478": "Well?",
  "7479": "And what sort of revenge would you take?",
  "7480": "Is it a time of war?",
  "7481": "I suppose that there has been no answer from my cabman advertisement?",
  "7482": "At this hour who would pass now?",
  "7483": "And what the devil do you wake me for?",
  "7484": "So you've got back?",
  "7485": "Then why don't you turn her out?",
  "7486": "Why should he go to a play if he enjoys it so little?",
  "7487": "Was it an angel's voice?",
  "7488": "Why, then, had he come hither?",
  "7489": "What was his version?",
  "7490": "Yet what good end can all this superficial counsel produce?",
  "7491": "What's the report of this boy?",
  "7492": "Take a glass of wine?",
  "7493": "And what has become of that scoundrel?",
  "7494": "But, what will you do?",
  "7495": "Are you coming down and fight fair?",
  "7496": "But what is the meaning of all this?",
  "7497": "Where be the dogs?",
  "7498": "Who is the master of the temple?",
  "7499": "And won't you come too?",
  "7500": "Well, what have I learned since?",
  "7501": "En didn't I bust up agin a lot er dem islands en have a turrible time en mos' git drownded?",
  "7502": "Would it bore you if I came in for a quarter of an hour?",
  "7503": "But if I disagree with his lordship's views?",
  "7504": "What can they mean?",
  "7505": "He has had punch already, has he not, sir?",
  "7506": "Shall you come down in the world for want of this letter about your son?",
  "7507": "So, then, you must leave us?",
  "7508": "But at any rate I have shown, have I not, that there is a certain element of improbability about the lady's story?",
  "7509": "And do you use this often?",
  "7510": "Has he got any?",
  "7511": "Are they friendly to us, do you think?",
  "7512": "Me alone?",
  "7513": "And you allow then, sir, that spheres exist, and that these marked and invisible beings mingle amongst us?",
  "7514": "Who knows if they will not manage to restore to me my pension?",
  "7515": "Poodle?",
  "7516": "Is she dead?",
  "7517": "But were you not on horseback?",
  "7518": "Is the countess up yet?",
  "7519": "Then this young man escaped with you?",
  "7520": "Where are my armies, my troops, my treasures?",
  "7521": "Canler?",
  "7522": "Do you belong to the number of the happy or of the miserable?",
  "7523": "But why couldn't he let me know?",
  "7524": "Will you promise to be quiet, and not kick up a fuss if I get you something to eat?",
  "7525": "And they not rich?",
  "7526": "In the rouge way?",
  "7527": "She did not resist, for what could she do?",
  "7528": "I shall hear from you?",
  "7529": "What what is, my dear?",
  "7530": "What did you do yesterday afternoon?",
  "7531": "Exploring or what?",
  "7532": "Why was he carried in a cart?",
  "7533": "Why surprised?",
  "7534": "What are you kicking up this row for?",
  "7535": "Yet are you not sorry for fellows of that stamp?",
  "7536": "What if he turns against the others?",
  "7537": "For is not my lord the son of a king?",
  "7538": "Why is it so long?",
  "7539": "Will he even pay me for his lodging?",
  "7540": "A mistake?",
  "7541": "Shall any man hate me?",
  "7542": "Two figures?",
  "7543": "What will dart out presently?",
  "7544": "Does he regret me a little?",
  "7545": "How do you look at the question?",
  "7546": "You remember?",
  "7547": "Then why are there different faiths?",
  "7548": "What be they?",
  "7549": "Have you any further commands for me?",
  "7550": "Won't you dine with me?",
  "7551": "There's her boots now, nice and decent for her evening use, and isn't it grand brushes she has?",
  "7552": "Is this your pupil?",
  "7553": "And what, pray, WAS the price?",
  "7554": "How is it with you?",
  "7555": "What o'clock is it?",
  "7556": "Surely the writer does not mean that a pleasant or delectable island would not be fit for breeding horses?",
  "7557": "You are a good temper?",
  "7558": "Had the crew seen me disappear?",
  "7559": "Don't you think we will?",
  "7560": "Now, do you understand me?",
  "7561": "How many times will I have to speak of this matter?",
  "7562": "On your arm?",
  "7563": "I understand, however, from the inquest that there were some objects which you failed to overlook?",
  "7564": "Why don't you go and get it then?",
  "7565": "Where are the graces of my soul?",
  "7566": "Do you know, sir, said she, that her ladyship intends to be down here with you in a few days?",
  "7567": "What is the meaning of this hunt, skipper?",
  "7568": "Why, had you no unicorn's horn, nor bezoar's stone about you, ha?",
  "7569": "Did you really think me capable of that?",
  "7570": "How do you like her, my dear?",
  "7571": "Shall I sure?",
  "7572": "And what did the master answer?",
  "7573": "Bobby?",
  "7574": "Is she sorry for her shameful conduct?",
  "7575": "Had he found some madman's means of proclaiming the scandal aloud?",
  "7576": "Whose portraits are those?",
  "7577": "What was the subject of these singular conversations?",
  "7578": "Is it a check to the action of the individual?",
  "7579": "She is melancholy, then?",
  "7580": "Have you noticed THAT THEY WON'T LET ANY ONE TOUCH THEM?",
  "7581": "What sympathy should a holy preacher have with either?",
  "7582": "Is is a bargain?",
  "7583": "Would not your excellency like a little refreshment?",
  "7584": "So, then, they have paid my ransom?",
  "7585": "Well, mademoiselle, what are you thinking about, standing there like a statue?",
  "7586": "Will you undertake the task?",
  "7587": "Tell me, will you do this for me, and cease to weep?",
  "7588": "Come, how much?",
  "7589": "Do you know, sir, that you are asking me very strange questions, and that I am very foolish to answer them?",
  "7590": "Shall I climb the magnolia?",
  "7591": "What becomes of them?",
  "7592": "You aren't angry, are you?",
  "7593": "Eh, madame, who knows?",
  "7594": "The ghost?",
  "7595": "Then why hasn't she missed him before?",
  "7596": "Gwendolen, will you marry me?",
  "7597": "Wouldn't you like to know who I am, child?",
  "7598": "Will you not rest here?",
  "7599": "What were you thinking of?",
  "7600": "You let my mother alone, will you?",
  "7601": "But what are you going to do?",
  "7602": "What proof may there be that you can do your part in the compact?",
  "7603": "You won't go back?",
  "7604": "Does he play well?",
  "7605": "Then what?",
  "7606": "Do you mean to say you have had my cigarette case all this time?",
  "7607": "Won't you come along with me?",
  "7608": "What do we mean when we say that one man isn't to be trusted as another?",
  "7609": "What shall we do then?",
  "7610": "Jean, do you think that I am quite mad?",
  "7611": "Why is not her joy complete?",
  "7612": "Do you know his abode?",
  "7613": "And who was this uncle?",
  "7614": "And will not such things sharpen your souls to revenge?",
  "7615": "Oh, what do you want?",
  "7616": "Who asked after a day or two?",
  "7617": "How could she have been so blind?",
  "7618": "Is this our previous understanding?",
  "7619": "Certainly, why not?",

  "8046": "Why should they try to influence him?",
  "8047": "Did you ever?",
  "8048": "You're sure her chamber is above the hallway, and that there's a staircase to it from the main hall?",
  "8049": "Is that all you have to say for yourself?",
  "8050": "But what should he do?",
  "8051": "Will you let me go?",
  "8052": "Do I not already stand here wet with thy misery, and drenched like a dog?",
  "8053": "What's all this for?",
  "8054": "Why don't you jump, you bloody fool?",
  "8055": "Why should not we have a poetry and philosophy of insight, and not of tradition?",
  "8056": "Later?",
  "8057": "Must we in all things look for the how and the why and wherefore?",
  "8058": "Are they as far out as this?",
  "8059": "Did you ever hear anything so awful as that?",
  "8060": "What have we to do with this toothless fool?",
  "8061": "And will she stay very long?",
  "8062": "No offence?",
  "8063": "Who's banging?",
  "8064": "Do I look like it?",
  "8065": "What has given you offence?",
  "8066": "Who was the moral man?",
  "8067": "Do you agree?",
  "8068": "Now, what is the form of procedure?",
  "8069": "Why does he give himself away to such canaille?",
  "8070": "Do you think he does?",
  "8071": "Have you a house in that neighbourhood?",
  "8072": "Charley?",
  "8073": "Are strangers with your tribute to be tax'd?",
  "8074": "Has the law ears to be melted by your sweet voice?",
  "8075": "Who calls me villain?",
  "8076": "Do you think so, my lord?",
  "8077": "Of course she must give him an answer, but how would she give it?",
  "8078": "What makes you put so much butter on the steak?",
  "8079": "You say you are this young lady's brother?",
  "8080": "Why is it that you doubt my word?",
  "8081": "Why didn't I never hear this before?",
  "8082": "You put me off, do you?",
  "8083": "No one observes us?",
  "8084": "And what will you say to them?",
  "8085": "What can they be doing inside?",
  "8086": "I suppose you don't care for me in that way any more?",
  "8087": "And what do you think of her personal appearance?",
  "8088": "And you will obey me, will you not?",
  "8089": "Have you any objection to my looking at your register?",
  "8090": "Or would the meteor prove too powerful for it?",
  "8091": "Could she be dreaming?",
  "8092": "We do seem to make a little progress, do we not?",
  "8093": "Where's the use of asking for such fellows' reasons?",
  "8094": "But what do you believe?",
  "8095": "I can work, then?",
  "8096": "Now what say you to a pasty, or a strip of beef cut where the juice runs, and maybe the half of a broiled fowl?",
  "8097": "Whether he could rush to the next assizes, and proclaim himself a lawyer?",
  "8098": "How can you ask me?",
  "8099": "And is the sum you bring me worth the trouble?",
  "8100": "How do you feel this morning?",
  "8101": "Where can you live?",
  "8102": "Where is that?",
  "8103": "Why do you point away?",
  "8104": "Or do they fall short of this perfect equality in a measure?",
  "8105": "How had I deserved to be so blessed by such confessions?",
  "8106": "Is not this rather an ad hominem style of argument?",
  "8107": "When does the projectile start?",
  "8108": "And that one yonder?",
  "8109": "In vain I ask the air and the trees why I should not drown myself?",
  "8110": "Haven't you got anything to say to me?",
  "8111": "Why did he not speak?",
  "8112": "Jarvie?",
  "8113": "I wonder why you ever fell in love with me?",
  "8114": "Tell us then boldly, what we must do for you?",
  "8115": "Of course, he did save the country, didn't he?",
  "8116": "It will not scratch and claw, but pet and comfort?",
  "8117": "How does she live?",
  "8118": "Who stole my bread?",
  "8119": "Were we to die as he had done?",
  "8120": "Then what on earth are they up to?",
  "8121": "Why do I come to you thus?",
  "8122": "You will ask me why I did not dispose of it?",
  "8123": "What have you to say now?",
  "8124": "Do you mean, were we talking about diamonds?",
  "8125": "Or, if the master would not stay, then the disciples would have followed him about everywhere, until they had got education enough?",
  "8126": "Shall I carry no message, madame?",
  "8127": "Aren't they terrifying?",
  "8128": "Would any man weary of it, or wish to turn away his eyes?",
  "8129": "What am I to say to him?",
  "8130": "What more can he do?",
  "8131": "But who can be angry at those assiduities which are meant to please him?",
  "8132": "Does that kind go smoothly?",
  "8133": "Does it hurt?",
  "8134": "Didn't you really know it all before?",
  "8135": "Where are you, old fellow?",
  "8136": "And have quite forgiven me?",
  "8137": "Did I say a word when he came and took me away, for no earthly reason, from the place where everybody was kind to me?",
  "8138": "How did you know it, then?",
  "8139": "Burning up your awld aunt's rubbidge, I suppose?",
  "8140": "Which room shall we do first?",
  "8141": "Mine?",
  "8142": "You would not make him a cuckold?",
  "8143": "Has he brought back the prisoners?",
  "8144": "What may be thy name?",
  "8145": "For what does reason discover, when it pronounces any action vicious?",
  "8146": "But why should you want to paint me?",
  "8147": "What do you wish?",
  "8148": "Why is the workingman prohibited from charging a like interest for his capital, which is himself?",
  "8149": "Are you ashamed of it?",
  "8150": "Do you think he won't be happy with me?",
  "8151": "But you expected some one then?",
  "8152": "And did he spring clean from the mark or had he to get off with a push?",
  "8153": "You did not see her?",
  "8154": "Tell me what should you say, darling?",
  "8155": "But, in the name of heaven, man, where did you get these extraordinary clothes?",
  "8156": "You say you heard a knocking?",
  "8157": "But what is to be done now?",
  "8158": "But how did you feel when you were loved by a servant?",
  "8159": "Dobbin?",
  "8160": "Will you set them fighting still further, or will you make peace between them?",
  "8161": "Do you suppose if there was any offence given me, I shouldn't name it, and request to have it corrected?",
  "8162": "Think we're liable to have much trouble?",
  "8163": "You've brought it, have you?",
  "8164": "What think you my friend did?",
  "8165": "And what imports this?",
  "8166": "Biribi?",
  "8167": "What more did I want?",
  "8168": "In the middle of the performance?",
  "8169": "What in the world can be more ridiculous than commercial laws carried out to one's own detriment?",
  "8170": "Didn't I say it all along?",
  "8171": "With THEM?",
  "8172": "And why do we fuss and fume sometimes?",
  "8173": "But why would you return to face again the fierce banth, or whatever other form of destruction they have loosed within that awful trap?",
  "8174": "Do you know what my private and candid opinion is about some of those little jokers?",
  "8175": "What'll he do with it?",
  "8176": "But what next?",
  "8177": "The letter about the mortgage has come, has it?",
  "8178": "You like it so, I suppose?",
  "8179": "A robber maybe?",
  "8180": "And why do you serve?",
  "8181": "Must he see, must he know?",
  "8182": "Do they denote or connote anything?",
  "8183": "Do you, then, really return?",
  "8184": "What a temptin lookin critter you'd be among the galls, would'nt you?",
  "8185": "Think only, what are my children to be?",
  "8186": "You were not content to hear me, eh?",
  "8187": "What have I done that this burden should be laid on me?",
  "8188": "Will you bet?",
  "8189": "What did he give for that picture upstairs which the young man painted?",
  "8190": "Is not our fortune famous, brave, and great?",
  "8191": "Are you so daintily brought up, you cannot eat your own flesh?",
  "8192": "Did you see that one?",
  "8193": "Why shall I not tell the rabbis on you?",
  "8194": "Will you come up?",
  "8195": "How can you show me that you are telling the truth?",
  "8196": "What do you call it?",
  "8197": "Where is your sash, my dear?",
  "8198": "Why didn't you come home?",
  "8199": "And to whom?",
  "8200": "How long would he be left uneducated?",
  "8201": "Don't they, old thing?",
  "8202": "Only you here?",
  "8203": "Ah, naughty, naughty, would you take a nip at the gentleman?",
  "8204": "What does the presence do?",
  "8205": "Who would not suffer amid perfumed tapestries, cushioned furniture, and liveried servants?",
  "8206": "Well, and how are you?",
  "8207": "Yet who else in all the world was there with the strength and agility to do what this man was now doing?",
  "8208": "Why be uneasy?",
  "8209": "So you are going to sell the place?",
  "8210": "Is he still in a fit?",
  "8211": "But heavens, why?",
  "8212": "What might you be able to do?",
  "8213": "Music?",
  "8214": "There is then more than one who might await you there?",
  "8215": "What's the matter with your tooth?",
  "8216": "Can she have it today?",
  "8217": "Well, who is my benefactor?",
  "8218": "Why so, if you please?",
  "8219": "Where is the man who was here?",
  "8220": "Who again was his closest ally?",
  "8221": "What is your history?",
  "8222": "Is he ill?",
  "8223": "Are you coming tomorrow?",
  "8224": "How now?",
  "8225": "For the best?",
  "8226": "You are home, then, my dear master?",
  "8227": "Count 'em?",
  "8228": "And did you convey this answer to your guest?",
  "8229": "By after 'all' you mean after she's in love with somebody else?",
  "8230": "Did you ever see such a den, my dear?",
  "8231": "Yet why are those names disgraceful?",
  "8232": "Not damn the sharper, but the dice?",
  "8233": "And what IS her idea?",
  "8234": "Do you feel inclined to make the monks' acquaintance once more?",
  "8235": "Why don't you wish to come back home?",
  "8236": "What do you find to attract you in this poor drab little country?",
  "8237": "Are they little, then?",
  "8238": "What are you thinking about, doctor?",
  "8239": "Is it that the poets are deliberately trying to present the conditions of an age anterior to their own?",
  "8240": "Why didn't she tell me something?",
  "8241": "What do you want me for, sir?",
  "8242": "You don't think I would shy things at you?",
  "8243": "Who spoke of such a thing?",
  "8244": "Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?",
  "8245": "What, my rival?",
  "8246": "My little lady, where are you going to?",
  "8247": "What can it mean?",
  "8248": "Would you counsel him to do so?",
  "8249": "Shall I also smite them dead?",
  "8250": "Bah, really?",
  "8251": "You dispute me?",
  "8252": "May I ask what led to this change?",
  "8253": "Why not a fortnight from now?",
  "8254": "What means this shouting in the house?",
  "8255": "And shall disaffection only be rewarded with security?",
  "8256": "Where else will one find a more happy union of magnificence and comfort, where better arrangements to facilitate commerce?",
  "8257": "May I ask why that date?",
  "8258": "You think I won't get to him?",
  "8259": "Did you get him?",
  "8260": "Is conduct everything?",
  "8261": "You have, then, a repugnance to your profession?",
  "8262": "What could be the matter?",
  "8263": "What will the other employers do?",
  "8264": "Where is the doctor?",
  "8265": "Who'll stop me?",
  "8266": "Then will you not forgive me?",
  "8267": "Would you like to speak to him?",
  "8268": "Well, how is he?",
  "8269": "Why not own your own home?",
  "8270": "Whence came it, think you?",
  "8271": "Was he angry, or pleased?",
  "8272": "But how discover what demands are just?",
  "8273": "Snow?",
  "8274": "How many miles?",
  "8275": "That's a pleasant life, isn't it?",
  "8276": "What sort of legislators were they?",
  "8277": "As he was to finish reading there, why not set out at once?",
  "8278": "Does she love me?",
  "8279": "Then, why did you think of giving your daughter to him?",
  "8280": "You won't refuse to humour one of them, I hope?",
  "8281": "Are they out beanfeasting?",
  "8282": "Is it not that we may enjoy our liberty?",
  "8283": "Whither else?",
  "8284": "How then shall I take away these opinions?",
  "8285": "You are hurt?",
  "8286": "Any occasion to show my papers?",
  "8287": "What are you laughing at, husband?",
  "8288": "And what could he say to her?",
  "8289": "What does it matter to me?",
  "8290": "But surely you would not wish to offend the bishop?",
  "8291": "Why don't you fall?",
  "8292": "Can this be my whole purpose?",
  "8293": "What did she know of this strange creature at her side?",
  "8294": "Pyramids?",
  "8295": "What is ther to do, now?",
  "8296": "How did you begin?",
  "8297": "When I heard her dismiss the footman, I stepped up to him and asked him, what little lady that was?",
  "8298": "You may ask, by what authority do I venture, being a person not concerned in the practice of medicine, to meddle with that subject?",
  "8299": "And what do you wonder?",
  "8300": "So I's to gouge out all their eyes, eh?",
  "8301": "What was it about?",
  "8302": "And the hyperbola?",
  "8303": "And in what city did you live?",
  "8304": "Are you not ashamed to speak to a wretch lying on the stones?",
  "8305": "Can I do anything for you?",
  "8306": "Yet how many people have I hated in my life?",
  "8307": "Will you take a chair?",
  "8308": "And straightway hereupon, arose the natural question of cui bono?",
  "8309": "Could that girl have been playing off any of her coquettish tricks?",
  "8310": "What was I to say?",
  "8311": "Where are you damn'd?",
  "8312": "Do you care to pursue further?",
  "8313": "You take me?",
  "8314": "What could I do but follow him?",
  "8315": "So why was she surprised?",
  "8316": "Will they be here long?",
  "8317": "What means this violence in my house?",
  "8318": "You are quite aware of that?",
  "8319": "There is to be no doubt about that, is there?",
  "8320": "What mean you?",
  "8321": "Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed?",
  "8322": "And what if they were friends, brethren, countrymen?",
  "8323": "Have we not thieves enow among us already?",
  "8324": "I asked if the master was in?",
  "8325": "Why are you killing the boy?",
  "8326": "Shall I ring for them to carry you down?",
  "8327": "Is it a blaspheming clause or reserve any way scandalous unto the world?",
  "8328": "Why should he go and be killed or maimed for life?",
  "8329": "And who is this woman?",
  "8330": "What are we to fight about?",
  "8331": "And how then?",
  "8332": "Where's he going to?",
  "8333": "Do you know how my little brother is, sir?",
  "8334": "Would you like to go to school?",
  "8335": "What's a ransom?",
  "8336": "Anything wanting to the bonnet?",
  "8337": "Indeed, even apart from an analogy, is it not mighty interesting to narrate, anyway?",
  "8338": "But was I free to claim this liberty?",
  "8339": "Is he hanging somewhere?",
  "8340": "The bear?",
  "8341": "What time is it?",
  "8342": "Straker?",
  "8343": "Oh, he is, is he?",
  "8344": "Do you know the depth of the ocean?",
  "8345": "What can I do for you?",
  "8346": "Do you dare to die?",
  "8347": "Long from home?",
  "8348": "What have you done, indeed?",
  "8349": "Would the gentleman like this room?",
  "8350": "Can I drop you anywhere?",
  "8351": "Was it some midnight assassin who had come to carry out the murderous orders of the secret tribunal?",
  "8352": "But is this all that is known?",
  "8353": "Did you see?",
  "8354": "Now, maiden, before this wedding continues, whom will you have to husband?",
  "8355": "Why that word virtuous, said he, I pray you?",
  "8356": "What was it you did say to the archbishop?",
  "8357": "Is that letter for me?",
  "8358": "To set off to see her again?",
  "8359": "Ought I to be angry with her for being faithful to him?",
  "8360": "What shall I do?",
  "8361": "Do you know this girl that your friend has made himself a fool about?",
  "8362": "I couldn't propose to her tonight, I suppose?",
  "8363": "Wasn't he sorry then?",
  "8364": "Did you get my hedgehog?",
  "8365": "And what would you do?",
  "8366": "Do you know that he loves YOU, yet?",
  "8367": "Whither so fast?",
  "8368": "You are wise women, aren't you?",
  "8369": "A pretty figure I'd be, wouldn't I, stuck behind that chap on a pillion?",
  "8370": "Well, we're all getting acquainted pretty quick, don't you think?",
  "8371": "Sonya, what is the matter with you?",
  "8372": "Why should he die?",
  "8373": "Are you off?",
  "8374": "How like you him?",
  "8375": "Who, in the situation in which the world has placed me, has a right to require more at my hands?",
  "8376": "Why do you ask with such alarm?",
  "8377": "Where could he hope to find this powerful help?",
  "8378": "Will you come out with me?",
  "8379": "Who did that there?",
  "8380": "Why do you keep fidgeting, why don't you go to sleep?",
  "8381": "What would you that I should reply?",
  "8382": "And are you trying to keep it from me?",
  "8383": "Will you go to the ship in the boat?",
  "8384": "Does that satisfy you?",
  "8385": "The horrible punishment to which you have condemned me for the last six years?",
  "8386": "She had asked him whether the tyrant was soon to pass that way?",
  "8387": "Men in this place?",
  "8388": "You won't be here long, I suppose?",
  "8389": "To whom did you say?",
  "8390": "To make your will?",
  "8391": "What's the use of making mysteries?",
  "8392": "Do you take a middle course?",
  "8393": "And are you going to run away before you have fairly taught or learned whether they are true or not?",
  "8394": "Did you catch a glimpse of the towns on its borders?",
  "8395": "And pray what IS my position, madame?",
  "8396": "What has he against me?",
  "8397": "What can a fellow do with a fellow like that?",
  "8398": "Whence shall they come?",
  "8399": "Attentive?",
  "8400": "Are you in a great hurry?",
  "8401": "But that I feare?",
  "8402": "Corky around?",
  "8403": "Gone?",
  "8404": "Was I convinced of the truth of what I had heard?",
  "8405": "How would the papers talk about it?",
  "8406": "Now, what theory could justify these perpetual hecatombs?",
  "8407": "A family gathering, is it not, with these old fellows under us here?",
  "8408": "And can therefore neither be ignorance nor knowledge?",
  "8409": "Does the night arise?",
  "8410": "Do you like the position of it?",
  "8411": "But why should I not?",
  "8412": "Is it sooth?",
  "8413": "What right have you, monseigneur, to demand an account of my attachments and friendships?",
  "8414": "Who the devil's that?",
  "8415": "Good?",
  "8416": "Officers, do you hear?",
  "8417": "Shall I guess?",
  "8418": "What has brought you here?",
  "8419": "Where can all the strength of those medicines go, my dear?",
  "8420": "Did you ever see such a binding?",
  "8421": "And shall we proceed to get rid of the weepings and wailings of famous men?",
  "8422": "Why, have you got into a scrape and want to know how he'll take it?",
  "8423": "Watch in hand?",
  "8424": "How do you find them?",
  "8425": "Are you going to read the paper next?",
  "8426": "Until I die?",
  "8427": "Why do you not work?",
  "8428": "Was there no other cheaper house to seek?",
  "8429": "How is this ?",
  "8430": "If we are drowned, will it not be drowned too?",
  "8431": "Or a fulfiller?",
  "8432": "Did you hear?",
  "8433": "And what are strength and courage?",
  "8434": "You are a brave people and you love bravery, but where was your mighty jeddak during the fighting today?",
  "8435": "Why are the people here?",
  "8436": "Who was the anonymous person, eh?",
  "8437": "Why are you laid up again?",
  "8438": "Single or married?",
  "8439": "What remained for her, but to train her children in her own views and sentiments?",
  "8440": "What brings you here, man?",
  "8441": "But what is the truth?",
  "8442": "You give me the lie and will not draw your sword?",
  "8443": "And where do you live?",
  "8444": "Had she given up to heaven the pure soul of an old maid, the calm soul of a spouse, the tender one of a mother, or one moved by love?",
  "8445": "You can't think worse than that?",
  "8446": "Well, wouldn't she be a good wife?",
  "8447": "Can anyone who reads these lines form an idea of the effect this had upon us?",
  "8448": "Why, how came you to be so well acquainted with all this?",
  "8449": "Why should he respect any but himself?",
  "8450": "Will you eat a pudding?",
  "8451": "Will you wake me, before departing?",
  "8452": "What did you tell me?",
  "8453": "But if you have why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures?",
  "8454": "What end would that answer?",
  "8455": "What have you done to me?",
  "8456": "Why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them?",
  "8457": "Laurie, when are you going to your grandfather?",
  "8458": "Is the circumstance strange or novel?",
  "8459": "Do you call this a wedding?",
  "8460": "And it's that you'd call sport, is it, to be abroad in the darkness with yourself alone?",
  "8461": "Who could rescue him from that powerful pressure?",
  "8462": "What happened to her?",
  "8463": "Were the bulls short, with crooked legs?",
  "8464": "Already?",
  "8465": "Will he not also require natural aptitude for his calling?",
  "8466": "And does your ingratitude upbraid me for this?",
  "8467": "And you, you mountebank, what are you laughing at?",
  "8468": "Would she like it?",

  "9320": "Why then had he chosen her?",
  "9321": "Was it water, the profound abyss?",
  "9322": "Do you call THAT sort of thing work?",
  "9323": "Where should he get such a position?",
  "9324": "Don't you know you are nearly surrounded by fire?",
  "9325": "Is it comfortable there?",
  "9326": "What do you think she saw?",
  "9327": "And are pains, as pains, alike?",
  "9328": "Do you know him?",
  "9329": "What can be worse than what I now behold?",
  "9330": "You stand fast?",
  "9331": "Is this my pale, little elf?",
  "9332": "Large or small?",
  "9333": "What walls can guard me, or what shades can hide?",
  "9334": "Does one begrudge it her?",
  "9335": "How do you know?",
  "9336": "And whither will he direct his footsteps?",
  "9337": "What do you say, my son?",
  "9338": "What is he like?",
  "9339": "And then, is this the only thing?",
  "9340": "Will you take me?",
  "9341": "Tell me, by doing what?",
  "9342": "Why, what is there shameful?",
  "9343": "Are you really going to the theater?",
  "9344": "Oh are you?",
  "9345": "Would you mind helping me out until then?",
  "9346": "A meteor burning in space?",
  "9347": "What other form of government, indeed, can so well deserve our esteem and love?",
  "9348": "Who did most valiantly?",
  "9349": "To whom do you tell that?",
  "9350": "What's in it?",
  "9351": "Ain't I volatile?",
  "9352": "But CAN the national or racial hat be an old hat?",
  "9353": "For what?",
  "9354": "I mean to say, something inconsistent with the laws of nature?",
  "9355": "Are the writings ready?",
  "9356": "Will you promise never to meddle with my affairs again, if I prove to you that I am loved for my own sake?",
  "9357": "How are you going to save the world?",
  "9358": "And do not courageous men face death because they are afraid of yet greater evils?",
  "9359": "Do you not agree with me?",
  "9360": "Is he so poor?",
  "9361": "Looks like justice, this, don't it?",
  "9362": "Was you looking for him?",
  "9363": "Mariette?",
  "9364": "Did she lie down in the gloomy bedroom of the old inn that night with her will bent unwaveringly on the path of penitent sacrifice?",
  "9365": "Did you think I had forgotten what I said?",
  "9366": "Would you quit the home of delight so soon?",
  "9367": "You consider him a fine boy, do you, sir?",
  "9368": "What has she given you?",
  "9369": "They are in process of recollecting that which they learned before?",
  "9370": "In such a case, to whom will the salary belong?",
  "9371": "May I inquire what kind, my friend?",
  "9372": "Is that necessary?",
  "9373": "Had he any enemies?",
  "9374": "Where shall I go to find them?",
  "9375": "Why don't you get your grandmother to make you a new pair?",
  "9376": "And how are you?",
  "9377": "Such a passage exists?",
  "9378": "What right have they to butcher me?",
  "9379": "What can it cost you to say just this one word?",
  "9380": "But what was passing around them?",
  "9381": "But who can cure a broken heart?",
  "9382": "But what has mademoiselle to do with it?",
  "9383": "Did you find the missing money?",
  "9384": "Now?",
  "9385": "If we are in danger of hitting another one of those things, or even a meteor, we'll steer out of the way, won't we?",
  "9386": "And was not one such instance enough for one generation?",
  "9387": "When could she rouse him and send him away?",
  "9388": "And why may we not for fifty times as long?",
  "9389": "Do you desire this assistance for your own soul?",
  "9390": "But you are upset about something?",
  "9391": "You're not in the same way, I hope?",
  "9392": "Supposing now that some of them were to slip into the boat at night and cut the cable, and make off with her?",
  "9393": "And the knowing is wise?",
  "9394": "What d'you suppose it's called the day of rest for?",
  "9395": "Have you ever taken in any way what belonged to another?",
  "9396": "How can I acknowledge that I must not do what I consider to be my duty?",
  "9397": "What do you decide upon, monseigneur?",
  "9398": "Why did you not mention his name at once?",
  "9399": "Are you at all in earnest?",
  "9400": "Well, how did she die?",
  "9401": "Are not revolutions transfigurations?",
  "9402": "Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?",
  "9403": "How did you deduce the select?",
  "9404": "That, already deprived by death of one parent, he was now by her own voluntary act to lose the second too?",
  "9405": "Did he thank us?",
  "9406": "How do you get your 'tip,' as you call it?",
  "9407": "Aren't you going to eat anything?",
  "9408": "All right so far, what?",
  "9409": "How is your sister?",
  "9410": "Well, what would you have me do?",
  "9411": "But where does he take his millions to?",
  "9412": "This is a nice scrape you've got me into, isn't it?",
  "9413": "For why should I give to my foes such great store of goods?",
  "9414": "What could it all mean?",
  "9415": "How many men have lost their lives here?",
  "9416": "And they are generated one from the other?",
  "9417": "Did you get them on the sit or how?",
  "9418": "And therefore you will tell me what more you know about me?",
  "9419": "What is the matter with you, my darling?",
  "9420": "Won't you come here again?",
  "9421": "Is that the way YOU manage?",
  "9422": "Would they ever have the means to send him to a public school, to buy him a practice, or start him in business?",
  "9423": "Where's your rouble?",
  "9424": "But the three millions?",
  "9425": "Will you overcome me in this?",
  "9426": "In the present case, what circumstances called for extraordinary rigour?",
  "9427": "Why shall A adopt the plan of B rather than B that of A?",
  "9428": "And what is it that has made them grey?",
  "9429": "Then what good is it discussing the matter?",
  "9430": "Where will she wait for him?",
  "9431": "The name of that gentleman?",
  "9432": "What could be more delightful?",
  "9433": "But grant him riches, your demand is o'er?",
  "9434": "Where shall we meet?",
  "9435": "Know you why those four men were sent to the stake?",
  "9436": "Why, did he not entice his father into the hut, and then shut the door upon him, and throw a coat over his head?",
  "9437": "Who knew?",
  "9438": "Looks that way, don't it?",
  "9439": "What brought you back?",
  "9440": "What do these ruffians want with you?",
  "9441": "Why what harm can it do?",
  "9442": "Why, d'you want me to do anything else?",
  "9443": "How can we fix a price?",
  "9444": "You have seen the count, you say?",
  "9445": "Where can I find them again?",
  "9446": "And what is this painting to represent?",
  "9447": "You don't want marriage?",
  "9448": "My dear fellow, don't you always know what to say?",
  "9449": "Then I have your leave, sir?",
  "9450": "Pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door?",
  "9451": "Who can deny it?",
  "9452": "What answer's that?",
  "9453": "Is it uncommon for the best ocean steamers to be two or three days behind time?",
  "9454": "Of what?",
  "9455": "What did you want to come here for?",
  "9456": "Had not its eyes, placed at the back of its head, considerable development?",
  "9457": "But isn't it a shame to make such laws?",
  "9458": "What ails the boy?",
  "9459": "You are a colonel?",
  "9460": "Have I the strength?",
  "9461": "Would not her life be much more blessed when this cause of all her troubles should be removed from her?",
  "9462": "But you can know nothing of this?",
  "9463": "Why did you hold the candle horizontally?",
  "9464": "Do you wish the notary to be sent for immediately?",
  "9465": "Why should we not succeed?",
  "9466": "What kind of artists?",
  "9467": "Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him?",
  "9468": "What do you want me to do with them?",
  "9469": "Then I may kiss you?",
  "9470": "Know ye not that whoso diggeth a pit for his brother shall fall into it?",
  "9471": "How can that be?",
  "9472": "And I said, where was the risk?",
  "9473": "Is he all as he should be?",
  "9474": "Can't you trust me?",
  "9475": "Can we not count upon some independent votes?",
  "9476": "Well, what is the matter, my dear?",
  "9477": "Do you go and see those other roses now?",
  "9478": "How is the worthy alderman, and my lady, your excellent mother, sir?",
  "9479": "Shall we go to the post?",
  "9480": "What burner?",
  "9481": "Weel, sir, what say you to your handiwork?",
  "9482": "Why should she?",
  "9483": "But are you not mistaken?",
  "9484": "What somebody?",
  "9485": "What do you here?",
  "9486": "Why didn't you keep your health, deceiving one like this?",
  "9487": "With my companions?",
  "9488": "Then where could they possibly be?",
  "9489": "And saved with him after the shipwreck?",
  "9490": "Did he kill those six persons?",
  "9491": "How does it happen?",
  "9492": "Justice and health of mind will be of the company, and temperance will follow after?",
  "9493": "Won't he see it then?",
  "9494": "How can you tell that you won't?",
  "9495": "You never did ask each other anything, did you?",
  "9496": "But who'll get him to come down?",
  "9497": "For business?",
  "9498": "Who has sent you so far by yourself?",
  "9499": "And again, how did you know?",
  "9500": "Was it worth while for that to give up one's youth, and the gaiety of life, and the manifold chances of being?",
  "9501": "And, besides, where could we land?",
  "9502": "Say, boy, what's the matter with your father?",
  "9503": "You won't mind?",
  "9504": "What was this radiant glory?",
  "9505": "You ask for this thing?",
  "9506": "Do you mean to say anything, you young shaver?",
  "9507": "Do you not know that all this is but the prelude to the actual strain which we have to learn?",
  "9508": "Well, but there?",
  "9509": "Have we had any peace upon this matter springing from any other basis?",
  "9510": "Oh, there was childish love?",
  "9511": "Why don't you go down and ferret her out in the village?",
  "9512": "What's happening down there?",
  "9513": "Will you come with us?",
  "9514": "What a place you must hunt whiskers in?",
  "9515": "What man is that?",
  "9516": "What stream can wash away a mother's curse?",
  "9517": "But you do not forgive me?",
  "9518": "Wherever I am, am I not in my own house?",
  "9519": "Who could have bound the lamb to the wolf, and, what was still more incomprehensible, have attached the wolf to the lamb?",
  "9520": "Is he a rank heretic?",
  "9521": "Shall my son gain a benevolence by my death?",
  "9522": "Is it?",
  "9523": "Me, ma'am?",
  "9524": "Is not that so?",
  "9525": "Who then will?",
  "9526": "What about the girl?",
  "9527": "A gang of murderers, are they not?",
  "9528": "In this house?",
  "9529": "Will rations answer your purpose?",
  "9530": "What are you meddling with?",
  "9531": "Has not this excellent man a right to my best and heartiest services, and should any considerations of self deter me from rendering them?",
  "9532": "You haven't gone and accepted him, child?",
  "9533": "Why an't you of your mother's way of thinking, my dear?",
  "9534": "Whither are you bound?",
  "9535": "Should he open the door?",
  "9536": "Had always the earache?",
  "9537": "Where shall we drive you, sir?",
  "9538": "What is the diversion?",
  "9539": "Why have they taken it away?",
  "9540": "What matter ages in this world of perpetual youth?",
  "9541": "How shall I pass through them unhurt?",
  "9542": "Have you not strength enough to hold the weak twig?",
  "9543": "And where's the fur cloak?",
  "9544": "In fact, who has proclaimed the principle of insurrection as a duty?",
  "9545": "Why ashamed?",
  "9546": "What difference does it make whether a man be baptized in river or washbowl, or not at all?",
  "9547": "And what happened?",
  "9548": "Now where is that rudderless boat?",
  "9549": "I don't like to ask such a thing, my dear, but would you walk a little way?",
  "9550": "How were they to be protected from those who did not believe in their freedom and were determined to thwart it?",
  "9551": "Is it better that the promotion of officials should be governed by merit or by length of service?",
  "9552": "Rather unusual?",
  "9553": "What indeed?",
  "9554": "Perhaps you will lunch with me?",
  "9555": "What's the use of having artillery if it is not allowed to fire?",
  "9556": "Your majesty knows all that?",
  "9557": "What is your baptismal name?",
  "9558": "Surely not ALL, ma'am?",
  "9559": "Is this man to live for ever?",
  "9560": "Have you tied the knot?",
  "9561": "What did you bring it to me for?",
  "9562": "You has heard o' him, I guess, sir?",
  "9563": "What had become of them?",
  "9564": "What, my precious?",
  "9565": "Asleep?",
  "9566": "Surely it is better for you to take the substantial sum which I offer than to ruin this woman's career, which can profit you in no way?",
  "9567": "What mean you, man?",
  "9568": "Yet, who knows how long you'll be a stranger?",
  "9569": "That head I see now on your shoulders?",
  "9570": "And how well he looks on his horse, eh?",
  "9571": "From what quarter can the danger proceed?",
  "9572": "Then why talk about seeing me through at all?",
  "9573": "Build it in five minutes?",
  "9574": "But if he is dishonorable?",
  "9575": "Who I am, madame?",
  "9576": "Is it the language of a heart feeling as it ought to feel for the rights and happiness of the human race?",
  "9577": "What results flowed from the second?",
  "9578": "But, why are you so tame?",
  "9579": "What was that terror I felt of him?",
  "9580": "You don't happen to know any good of him, do you?",
  "9581": "Can't you keep it quiet?",
  "9582": "It is, then, somebody's head that you demand of me?",
  "9583": "But why so full of these fears and anxieties?",
  "9584": "What is, in its essence, this excellence or perfection of which we have more shining evidence as we go up in the scale?",
  "9585": "But where are we most likely to find a monkey?",
  "9586": "It may happen, too, that in the frankness of my story I must go further than is agreeable to the strict usages of your ears?",
  "9587": "Tell me, child, do you love your mamma?",
  "9588": "You will not go with us, then?",
  "9589": "Why had I been such a fool as to leave them?",
  "9590": "THINK of it, s'I?",
  "9591": "What did he answer?",
  "9592": "Shall I tell him to come up?",
  "9593": "In what way?",
  "9594": "Who can give it any definition which would not leave the utmost latitude for evasion?",
  "9595": "Has it a king or do the commons rule?",
  "9596": "What are you going to call her?",
  "9597": "Why, then, do I hesitate, crazed as I am?",
  "9598": "Filled out?",
  "9599": "But where are the poor fellows?",
  "9600": "He can't be taking anything but air now, can he?",
  "9601": "Who is it, my dear?",
  "9602": "There is some secret cause, then?",
  "9603": "But she hates me, despises me?",
  "9604": "Was it possible?",
  "9605": "You mean to say that that machine has travelled into the future?",
  "9606": "Was it government?",
  "9607": "Her feet will tread this sand, this walk, two paces from me?",
  "9608": "Who had darted that stone lance?",
  "9609": "If his motives were innocent, why does he not explain them?",
  "9610": "Didn't she tell me herself?",
  "9611": "Is the king accustomed to give you such reasons?",
  "9612": "Has the world grown smaller?",
  "9613": "You want a better sign?",
  "9614": "I suppose the ladies are down?",
  "9615": "What is wanted with me?",
  "9616": "How came it known?",
  "9617": "Had he not granted as his protection, where would we have been?",
  "9618": "Don't the others always run in and save them?",
  "9619": "But what is chance?",
  "9620": "Would she begin to look around in the business district?",
  "9621": "Hardly, I think?",
  "9622": "Do tell me that?",
  "9623": "Do you want a maid?",
  "9624": "Send two men?",
  "9625": "Will none of you restraine his fury?",
  "9626": "Was you camping?",
  "9627": "How do they use to walk?",
  "9628": "The realism of the ideal is very true, but how are you going to make amateurs or critics feel that?",
  "9629": "By heaven, would not such an one be a rare educator?",
  "9630": "What were we talking about before you mentioned the thing?",
  "9631": "Who stopped the horses?",
  "9632": "Where, then, could he have been?",
  "9633": "Do you give them to me?",
  "9634": "Should he write to her?",
  "9635": "I had no quarrel with the therns before, but can you wonder that I feel no great love for them now?",
  "9636": "Why do you humiliate yourself like this, and place yourself lower than these people?",
  "9637": "Grace, my dear, may I congratulate you?",
  "9638": "Is it about us?",
  "9639": "I ain't smashed your face, av I?",
  "9640": "Now, may I look?",
  "9641": "When you were a child, I suppose?",
  "9642": "See any cricket?",
  "9643": "Why, man, do you know what my profits are?",
  "9644": "Why shouldn't we seek them for ourselves?",
  "9645": "Weren't you asleep?",
  "9646": "And, indeed, who would have disputed with him the possession of this submarine property?",
  "9647": "Isn't our situation worth the little sacrifice?",
  "9648": "The persuaders?",
  "9649": "What other resource have I?",
  "9650": "How do I know that they are lying?",
  "9651": "Doubtless you made, then, some apology or explanation?",
  "9652": "Or the horseman by his art make them bad horsemen?",
  "9653": "What do you live for?",
  "9654": "Take me upstairs, is the canvas ready?",
  "9655": "Hope she had none, and who could offer it?",
  "9656": "What's your name?",
  "9657": "Why is it that such savage countries get all these fine things?",
  "9658": "How mean you that, friend?",
  "9659": "Shall I injure him because he wants to do me a service?",
  "9660": "Will you begin with this one?",
  "9661": "What could I do?",
  "9662": "But why should our poor creatures be deprived of so much nourishment?",
  "9663": "What right have you to call yourself so?",
  "9664": "And will it not be better?",
  "9665": "And clever?",
  "9666": "Oh dear me, don't it look lonesome?",
  "9667": "Have you any wish in reference to the period of your marriage, my child?",
  "9668": "What had she to fear?",
  "9669": "Have you a carriage?",
  "9670": "For what cause?",
  "9671": "Where can she be?",
  "9672": "But a moment ago you were moved by my representations, and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints?",
  "9673": "Won't you have some tea?",
  "9674": "Your father, uncle?",
  "9675": "Would her daughter be as forbearing?",
  "9676": "How about the trousseau?",
  "9677": "Is it against women?",
  "9678": "What household could be safe?",
  "9679": "And what is the truth of it?",
  "9680": "And why, when I have a sufficiency in my own single hands, should I scruple to make a woman equally happy, who has all I want?",
  "9681": "You had never spoken of them yourself to any one?",
  "9682": "Is it, then, any wonder, that under such a system of government, taxes and rates have multiplied to their present extent?",
  "9683": "Do you remember him?",
  "9684": "But death and suffering?",
  "9685": "Can you not come?",
  "9686": "What do they resemble?",
  "9687": "Have you got it now?",
  "9688": "You don't mean that?",
  "9689": "What we are going to do there?",
  "9690": "Is your aunt's romanticism always consistent with accuracy?",
  "9691": "But is not this rather disgraceful, and a very considerable proof of what I was saying, that you have no interest in the matter?",
  "9692": "What's that that whimpers over'ead?",
  "9693": "Pray what's the matter?",
  "9694": "My wickedness, is it?",
  "9695": "Into favor?",
  "9696": "How can you find out?",
  "9697": "What more have you to say?",
  "9698": "Are yeh hurt much?",
  "9699": "Does your ladyship wish for anything else?",
  "9700": "Was poison found?",
  "9701": "An explanation?",
  "9702": "Does humanity, on the whole, gain or lose by a given degree of conservatism?",
  "9703": "Not that gentleman?",
  "9704": "O, that's all, is it?",
  "9705": "So long as that?",
  "9706": "And what the eyes?",
  "9707": "Are volunteers still going out then?",
  "9708": "But did you not say that my kind grandfather's precaution had neutralized the poison?",
  "9709": "And your master?",
  "9710": "Where is monseigneur going?",
  "9711": "Have I not my talent left?",
  "9712": "Four boxes did you say?",
  "9713": "The moon?",
  "9714": "What does one risk in such a calling?",
  "9715": "Have you seen these pictures?",
  "9716": "Then where?",
  "9717": "And the walls, my child?",
  "9718": "Why should she be inclined to forgive him now?",
  "9719": "But what could he do?",
  "9720": "Have you any assistants, friend?",
  "9721": "A respectable sort of house?",
  "9722": "Always a fire, eh?",
  "9723": "How can I ever be anything but sick, at this life?",
  "9724": "Is it fighting you've been?",
  "9725": "You didn't mind my not sitting at one of your tables this afternoon?",
  "9726": "Where are we at this moment?",
  "9727": "What answer shall we give to those who would persuade us that things so unlike resemble each other?",
  "9728": "After your rigors and your refusals, how could I dream it was you?",
  "9729": "And how did you know there were six, you poor innocent?",
  "9730": "Why, did you think you had married a statue, or a motion, only?",
  "9731": "How many years is it since you approached the holy table?",
  "9732": "And what if he is lost in that immense country?",
  "9733": "Is this right?",
  "9734": "Of how much does he rob you every year?",
  "9735": "Are they drinking?",
  "9736": "Why, sir?",
  "9737": "But what do you mean by the king and queen?",

  "11031": "Is this a very terrible person?",
  "11032": "Where is she staying now?",
  "11033": "How is it I am not moving?",
  "11034": "It has indeed been a feast of reason and flow of soul, hasn't it?",
  "11035": "Are you jesting with me?",
  "11036": "No notice?",

  "11054": "They took this way?",
  "11055": "What does one want with dusty economic, books, which have made the world no better, or with mother's hideous chiffoniers?",
  "11056": "Then do they not love each other now?",
  "11057": "Shall I open it?",
  "11058": "Which dress am I to get ready?",
  "11059": "It would be an impertinence elsewhere, but it is not so here, to ask your name and condition?",

  "11068": "Are you going to be my servant?",
  "11069": "What other name does she go by?",
  "11070": "What is its duty?",
  "11071": "But, peradventure, it may be sagaciously urged, how is this?",
  "11072": "And yet how many might I not have been guilty of?",
  "11073": "Do not I tell you she will be your sister?",
  "11074": "So he was not there?",
  "11075": "What are you thinking of, eh?",
  "11076": "However, did I find you out?",
  "11077": "Whither now would they goad him?",
  "11078": "But is the thing settled between you or not?",
  "11079": "So it does not please you to work?",
  "11080": "Your savings?",

  "11082": "How much is a plate of peas?",
  "11083": "Would you like to come for a walk?",
  "11084": "Before?",
  "11085": "You won't take it from me?",
  "11086": "Would you not try to save her from suffering more even ifor would you?",
  "11087": "Why spoil such pleasant relations?",
  "11088": "Straker was brought back here, I presume?",
  "11089": "The only ones?",

  "11094": "But why is my grandfather allowed to live?",
  "11095": "How was it that two guns were abandoned in the center?",
  "11096": "And how is it possible for me to do so?",
  "11097": "Did a minute suffice for all this?",
  "11098": "And of what room was it the key?",

  "11261": "Is it only the guilty whose honor is at the sport of others, sir?",
  "11262": "Ain't it there in his bed, for a clew, after he's gone?",
  "11263": "Do you know the best of gettin' ashore again?",
  "11264": "Don't you want to help me?",
  "11265": "And what do you think he was doing?",
  "11266": "What's one to do, my dear?",
  "11267": "And what shall I wear?",
  "11268": "What was she like?",
  "11269": "Why, there is not a function of a single organ in the body which has not been determined wholly and solely by experiment?",

  "11271": "What think ye that it is?",
  "11272": "The big house near the sea, you mean?",
  "11273": "Is it not the idea which is developed through it, the emotion with which it vibrates, which expands, elevates and ennobles it?",
  "11274": "All over?",
  "11275": "Is he going to die?",
  "11276": "My foundation laid on earth for a mansion in heaven?",

  "11284": "Don't you know my voice?",
  "11285": "How much could I lose if things went wrong?",
  "11286": "On the west coast?",
  "11287": "What good do they do us?",

  "11289": "And what does it matter, now you're here to protect me?",
  "11290": "Who has occupied it the night before?",
  "11291": "Ten o'clock at night?",
  "11292": "The bottle must go somewhere, and why not here as well as anywhere else?",

  "12842": "And did they repeat what you said?",
  "12843": "Why do you conceal your necessities from me?",
  "12844": "And how do YOU know that he left two million and a half of roubles?",
  "12845": "Do you know if the marriage settlement he promised me has come?",
  "12846": "Now, I ask, why was all this done, but from that extremely weak and expensive doctrine, that the country could not bear it?",
  "12847": "Don't I?",

  "12860": "It was certain that the settlers would end by reinstating themselves in their domicile and driving out the intruders, but when and how?",
  "12861": "Took away?",
  "12862": "Does that mean you won't pay for it after having told me I could get it?",
  "12863": "Shall I bring him to you?",
  "12864": "Why did you leave the steak to fry, and the ale to run, and then spoil all the meal?",

  "12870": "With whom have I the honour?",
  "12871": "Do you know that profound thinker?",
  "12872": "To whom does this island belong?",
  "12873": "Isn't that rather a large order?",
  "12874": "The bourgeoisie?",
  "12875": "And what?",
  "12876": "What do I stay here then?",
  "12877": "Is there to be no limit, no end to the injustice we heap upon this unfortunate people?",

  "12889": "Sure nothing has happened?",
  "12890": "What else could I make of it but the one sorry theory?",
  "12891": "Was it a fortress?",
  "12892": "What should she do?",
  "12893": "Do you see this?",
  "12894": "Why, who SHOULD interfere with him?",

  "13793": "Of what did these lovers talk then?",
  "13794": "Well, what?",
  "13795": "And how is our patient?",
  "13796": "Was there any chance of escaping from the fury of this impetuous torrent, and of returning to the surface of the globe?",
  "13797": "Then what have you to say of me?",
  "13798": "What, still keeping up this silly jest?",
  "13799": "Shall we take our valets?",

  "13811": "What atmospheric disturbance was the cause of them?",
  "13812": "Astonish us?",
  "13813": "What's property?",
  "13814": "Besides, what good has it ever done when I have set my face against them?",

  "13828": "Would you like to become rich, or at least independent?",
  "13829": "Not the moon?",
  "13830": "Didn't I tell you he would have some devilish shrewd scheme?",
  "13831": "Like a drink?",
  "13832": "When did you see him?",
  "13833": "Sit down, won't you?",
  "13834": "And now let us see, young man, with your hand upon your conscience, how did all this come to pass?",
  "13835": "What sort of an actress was she?",
  "13836": "Of prosperity?",
  "13837": "Do parents bring children into the world for THOT?",
  "13838": "When have we had any quarrels over these things?",
  "13839": "And how did you find things there?",

  "13841": "You are quite comfortable here, aren't you?",
  "13842": "Well, if you knowed where he was, what did you ask me for?",
  "13843": "Well, are you moving soon?",
  "13844": "Brass's clerk, eh?",
  "13845": "Do you cut your pages with it, or what?",
  "13846": "And are you too great an enchanter ever to feel human suffering?",
  "13847": "Being transparent, so anyone can see through me, I'd look nice, wouldn't I, with a common mouse inside me?",
  "13848": "My remark is not then original?",
  "13849": "But where is he taking us to?",
  "13850": "Haven't we tried that before now, and what ever came of it?",
  "13851": "And you will stay with me?",

  "13859": "Is not this a clear sign of my ruin?",
  "13860": "Doesn't he have enough?",
  "13861": "Did he at all know where he wanted to live?",
  "13862": "And the drawers?",
  "13863": "Was she speaking thus seriously?",
  "13864": "Do you think I am deceived as to the flagrant impropriety of my conduct?",

  "13916": "Is it at all a treacherous case, do you think, or is it one of mere ordinary guilt?",
  "13917": "Why, then, do you trouble yourself about it?",
  "13918": "What are you hooroaring at?",
  "13919": "Why should I not have made up my mind?",
  "13920": "And, if we can make ready what we have, have we the means at hand to distribute it?",

  "13934": "Why didn't he think of it sooner?",
  "13935": "If he were to announce her origin bluntly, it might prevent the marriage, who knows?",

  "13986": "What is the actual social will of a community during the interval?",
  "13987": "But don't you think it can be brought about?",
  "13988": "But isn't there any mark or direction on these instruments, tools, or books, which would tell us something about them?",
  "13989": "Are there any enchantments that can prevail against true valour?",
  "13990": "Who are these people, that you should visit them at such an hour?",

  "14002": "Where is your mother?",
  "14003": "What was I about to do?",
  "14004": "And you are not offended?",
  "14005": "Is it for the innocent child?",
  "14006": "I wonder why it is that to lie securely in bed, with the light out, seems ever the same place, wherever in space one may chance to be?",
  "14007": "How the better?",
  "14008": "That's not much, is it?",
  "14009": "Where is the chief of the cohort?",

  "14087": "Katusha, why do you speak like that?",
  "14088": "Why did you insure your life?",
  "14089": "But if this law appoints an aristocracy, or a democracy, how will it help us in our present doubts?",

  "14100": "To join your dear husband?",
  "14101": "How about this rope?",
  "14102": "Then it has not dawned upon you?",
  "14103": "Is the indivisible subject, or immaterial substance, if you will, on the left or on the right hand of the perception?",
  "14104": "Really what?",
  "14105": "Or what think you of the playhouse?",
  "14106": "If I were weak now, what had I profited by those mercies?",

  "14125": "Yes, that is very true, but may I ask another question?",
  "14126": "Are you sure of that now?",
  "14127": "Where were you in the moon when the snakes cast off their skins?",
  "14128": "That shock threw you as well as me into the sea?",
  "14129": "Where will you hop?",
  "14130": "How can you read?",
  "14131": "Who shall be brought to the block?",
  "14132": "Love, where is thy victory?",
  "14133": "Not know?",
  "14134": "Is sought by any other suitor?",
  "14135": "Why separate us?",
  "14136": "How do I live?",
  "14137": "Well, are we all ready?",
  "14138": "Together?",
  "14139": "He's dead?",
  "14140": "And it is not yours?",
  "14141": "On what, then, depended the establishment and maintenance of equality in conditions and fortunes?",
  "14142": "How then is it that they lose their native mildness, and become morose and intolerant?",
  "14143": "Wasn't the old fellow going to notice the skin?",
  "14144": "But where is the girl?",
  "14145": "What says the maid herself to going?",
  "14146": "What do you know about my feelings, eh?",
  "14147": "At what o'clock, sir, do you breakfast?",
  "14148": "Didn't I ask you to bring this lady a glass of lemonade?",
  "14149": "Is it possible to imagine a man near a brazier who is not warm?",
  "14150": "And could he take a foundling to his heart?",
  "14151": "Why should he doubt it?",
  "14152": "What have YOU got to do with it, then, if a person may inquire?",
  "14153": "And you can't say I've not been awfully good, can you?",
  "14154": "And the opinion of the inquisitors?",
  "14155": "Why so many to be low and so few to be high?",
  "14156": "But what is there in running across it like that?",
  "14157": "What do you want with me in town?",
  "14158": "Why, the soldier broke one, didn't he?",
  "14159": "What then, pray, is this, father?",
  "14160": "Do you want them to separate?",
  "14161": "Shall I be a cuckold, father, yea or no?",
  "14162": "What will twelve dollars do towards keeping up this flat?",
  "14163": "And who has told you what is bad for another man?",
  "14164": "The ship's boat?",
  "14165": "Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it?",
  "14166": "Do you know that she has lost her father?",
  "14167": "Was it you who killed the artillery sergeant?",
  "14168": "Why not try to find an opening in another direction from that which has so unfortunately failed?",
  "14169": "What shall I say?",
  "14170": "What do the gentlemen wish?",
  "14171": "What is he himself?",
  "14172": "What's it been reading?",
  "14173": "But, dearest, why do you keep on laughing?",
  "14174": "I cry in my sleep where is he?",
  "14175": "Can you explain to me what signify this leave of absence and this letter, which I have just received?",
  "14176": "Did he begin to waver under the delusion of a breath of adventure?",
  "14177": "What party, then, shall we choose among these difficulties?",
  "14178": "How unfortnet do you want me fur to be?",
  "14179": "And it is not pleasant?",
  "14180": "What do we live for, if it is not to make life less difficult to each other?",
  "14181": "And who now fills the seat of royalty?",
  "14182": "Does it not?",
  "14183": "Was it not simpler to adopt the agrarian law straightway?",
  "14184": "Was the murderer abroad on those nights?",
  "14185": "Did you fasten all the windows?",
  "14186": "Well, that of body too?",
  "14187": "Philip, how dare you shake me in this way?",
  "14188": "Would it have been just for me to send you letters and cause the fall of one who had been so bountiful to me?",
  "14189": "Fits?",
  "14190": "And was he not consequently damned?",
  "14191": "Then, I said, our guardians must lay the foundations of their fortress in music?",
  "14192": "Ain't it a pity?",

  "14194": "In what corner of the world shall I seek thy fellow?",
  "14195": "But are you not wounded?",
  "14196": "And best give you, by the same token, yours to be magnificent with her?",
  "14197": "Who was that child?",
  "14198": "Who says this?",
  "14199": "May I speak of something serious to you, for once in my life?",
  "14200": "Do I ask in vain?",
  "14201": "And why is the life of a modest woman a perpetual conflict?",
  "14202": "Well, what are they?",
  "14203": "What can I do for you, sir?",
  "14204": "Then what compels me to wait two days?",
  "14205": "Can you form a judgment as to what distance we are likely to be carried?",
  "14206": "Would you like to see?",
  "14207": "You mean, no doubt, that you do not deny that might is right?",
  "14208": "What's the matter with me, anyhow?",
  "14209": "Do you want to have us killed one by one to diminish our force, and put us at the mercy of these wretches?",
  "14210": "Wasn't I honest with you?",
  "14211": "For where was life to be found?",
  "14212": "Will you be so good as to tell your mistress I am here?",
  "14213": "Or at the casement seen her stand?",
  "14214": "Do you mean to see me again?",
  "14215": "It seems a good deal, don't it?",
  "14216": "D'you mean to say you've had nothing but a bottle of milk for the last three days?",
  "14217": "Not if she gave up marrying?",
  "14218": "What makes you think so?",
  "14219": "Then where to seek a proper protector for you against the confusion and chances of such a scene?",
  "14220": "Why, sir, didn't you order me to marry her, and ain't I a good boy?",
  "14221": "Was it possible that the child was dead and was made alive again?",
  "14222": "How squares that story with thy present plea?",
  "14223": "Haven't you any forged letters to produce?",
  "14224": "Do you know a fish called the pompano?",
  "14225": "Can I believe him?",
  "14226": "Whenever I hit upon a good epithet, I back my luck, don't you see?",
  "14227": "What shame, inglorious if I quit the plain?",
  "14228": "Did that letter thoroughly explain my position and my views?",
  "14229": "With your own eyes?",
  "14230": "What have you got in it?",
  "14231": "Is it not important to know the exact position of affairs?",
  "14232": "How long was he?",
  "14233": "Shall it be a hard or a soft nib?",
  "14234": "Will you believe me?",
  "14235": "And how does he think it may be guarded against?",
  "14236": "What do you think is on his mind?",
  "14237": "What sort of a man was this I had to do with, and what schemes was he now revolving in his fearless mind?",
  "14238": "For what, sir?",
  "14239": "Yet from whom has not that rude hand rent away some dear connection?",
  "14240": "Do you really wish the bairn to go?",
  "14241": "On what charge do you arrest me?",
  "14242": "Why have schools?",
  "14243": "What were you saying?",
  "14244": "When had he a letter before that?",
  "14245": "But could manage them?",
  "14246": "They surely couldn't stop away more than a week, could they now?",
  "14247": "Will you honor your dead?",
  "14248": "Their situation?",
  "14249": "Where are you going to be married?",
  "14250": "Is he doing all right?",
  "14251": "Who had a son, had she not?",
  "14252": "You resist, do you?",
  "14253": "Yes, nobody minds them, so lark away, but don't get wild, will you?",
  "14254": "What then, discreet dame, is it that your mistress wants?",
  "14255": "What does the horrible creature mean?",
  "14256": "But you know where it is?",
  "14257": "If it is useful to go so far, may it not be much more useful to go still farther?",
  "14258": "And whom did that bold hussy think she could persuade to believe that?",
  "14259": "It is not possible, is it, to see a more perfect representation of annihilation?",
  "14260": "What did you do, then?",
  "14261": "What is it all?",
  "14262": "You are fond of gardening?",
  "14263": "But what does that matter?",
  "14264": "Where are they hiding?",
  "14265": "You would not be inclined to say, would you, that navigation is the art of medicine, at least if we are to adopt your exact use of language?",
  "14266": "What would the dear man have?",
  "14267": "Why should we ignore it now?",
  "14268": "Ye flee from me?",
  "14269": "And didn't I hear your message?",
  "14270": "But what if he should suffer the radish through obeying you, and be depillated with hot ashes?",
  "14271": "But where is the compass?",
  "14272": "And if the influence went with him into the tent, whose was it?",
  "14273": "Aren't we going too much to the left?",
  "14274": "Have you got a bit of good net, now?",
  "14275": "That's it, hey?",
  "14276": "Falsehoods?",
  "14277": "But tell me, how do the peasants look at it?",
  "14278": "Have you caught good poems?",
  "14279": "What have you just been saying, my friend?",
  "14280": "Can you tell us where he is?",
  "14281": "What is there to keep them together?",
  "14282": "A what?",
  "14283": "Do you suppose I don't see how you are suffering, how this has torn open your wounds?",
  "14284": "Is it just that she shall leave and pay no part of this herself?",
  "14285": "Do you mean I've been your victim?",
  "14286": "Wrong?",
  "14287": "What's that sir?",
  "14288": "Or while I continue to work at my picture, which will certainly never get finished?",
  "14289": "She has some recent association with the number twelve?",
  "14290": "This wound?",
  "14291": "But not all of it?",
  "14292": "How on earth can I dress up like that?",
  "14293": "So, you did see him when he was talking to you at the table?",
  "14294": "Was ever such a sneaking varmint?",
  "14295": "Is he gentle, father?",
  "14296": "What am I to tell you?",
  "14297": "You do not eat?",
  "14298": "Isn't the whole course of life made up of such?",
  "14299": "He was allying himself to science, for it was science but the absence of prejudice backed by the presence of money?",
  "14300": "Does he think me a ghost?",
  "14301": "Did she know of any place in the neighbourhood where a servant was wanted?",
  "14302": "And very good ones too, I believe, haven't they?",
  "14303": "Passed?",
  "14304": "You surely do not fancy that you can set them free?",
  "14305": "Who can tell it?",
  "14306": "Why will you persist in hopeless obstinacy?",
  "14307": "What did she do at my house?",
  "14308": "And what were the two lines?",
  "14309": "What should we do with this projected surplus?",
  "14310": "And yours?",
  "14311": "Walker, what is it?",
  "14312": "What are you going to do with that?",
  "14313": "What should we have to do?",
  "14314": "Have you no more to add?",
  "14315": "Then have you perceived that you say nothing to the purpose?",
  "14316": "Ye tremble at this word?",
  "14317": "Why has she done nothing to set things right?",
  "14318": "Who informed you this was the master I propose to you?",
  "14319": "Have you mentioned this death in your paper?",
  "14320": "How else could we live did the outer world not furnish our labour and our food?",
  "14321": "What were they to do?",
  "14322": "Work?",
  "14323": "And suppose we don't get her out of the house?",
  "14324": "How can I help it, if power like to walk on crooked legs?",
  "14325": "Wasn't I right to part with the horses?",
  "14326": "But if in my adventure I encounter aright, as I hope I will, shall I be fortunate?",
  "14327": "Where would I go to?",
  "14328": "Kit's there, is he?",
  "14329": "In what particulars?",
  "14330": "And your master, where is he?",
  "14331": "What have I to do with politics?",
  "14332": "And how far is it from looking to being, my good geographer?",
  "14333": "Is it unusual, unsophisticated, primitive?",
  "14334": "Isn't that a romantic name?",
  "14335": "Might we ask why there has been all this secrecy?",
  "14336": "What, is he gone unto my mother?",
  "14337": "Thy means of feeding?",
  "14338": "Oh, that was what you were saying as I came in?",
  "14339": "When did I first begin?",
  "14340": "Woan't yaw, my lad?",
  "14341": "Why, how so?",
  "14342": "Her heart simple and wilful as a bird's heart?",
  "14343": "What might the gentleman's name be, sir, that sent it?",
  "14344": "And is it worth tormenting oneself, when one has only a moment of life in comparison with eternity?",
  "14345": "May not something be done for her instant relief?",
  "14346": "Why do you spoil him like this?",
  "14347": "Then what has happened?",
  "14348": "Who knows?",
  "14349": "How dare you?",

  "14351": "Who could give you stouter help in return for your own support?",
  "14352": "What acquirement exalts one being above another?",
  "14353": "Who would care to live in such a region?",
  "14354": "And her address?",
  "14355": "How, then, could he have heard the bell?",
  "14356": "Were they plotting against me?",
  "14357": "And to the odd is opposed the even?",
  "14358": "But what are you going to do with the hay?",
  "14359": "He has not been moved at all?",
  "14360": "Why isn't there any one to look after you?",
  "14361": "And what is a man that he should not run with his brothers?",
  "14362": "And you really mean to stay by till that day comes?",
  "14363": "And when did mother die?",
  "14364": "And why glorious, my young friend?",
  "14365": "Are you going to get such and such a hat?",
  "14366": "Why train technicians?",
  "14367": "Why should we linger here?",
  "14368": "Do you think he is the devil, that so many of us should be afraid of him?",
  "14369": "What did she know?",
  "14370": "His father had just been trampled under foot and stamped upon in his presence, but by whom?",
  "14371": "And what is he to do?",
  "14372": "How do you think his majesty is affected?",
  "14373": "What experience have you had?",
  "14374": "Have you a sponge in your room?",

  "14429": "How can it be supposed that he should be the only rich man in his dominions who is insensible to pleasures of this kind ?",
  "14430": "Hain't we got all the fools in town on our side?",
  "14431": "Can any picture be more dreadful than that?",
  "14432": "Did I keep it?",
  "14433": "My dear, do you know that you are forgetting yourself altogether?",
  "14434": "They're in column, aren't they?",

  "14436": "Could his own conscience ever forgive him if he deserted her?",
  "14437": "Why SHOULD I go there?",
  "14438": "It bores you to be like other men?",
  "14439": "And when do you expect this to happen?",
  "14440": "Had he lost his power of scenting out catastrophes?",
  "14441": "The mountains?",

  "14514": "How's the patient?",
  "14515": "Is it possible for the human mind to conceive of a more horrible state of society?",
  "14516": "Still, what can we do?",
  "14517": "Have the police come?",
  "14518": "What are we waiting for?",
  "14519": "Is it all over?",
  "14520": "ARE you going to marry her or not?",
  "14521": "And can force, in default of reason, alone introduce them into our laws?",
  "14522": "Do you think he will die?",
  "14523": "Why should I not take his part?",
  "14524": "Make up for what?",
  "14525": "The procureur?",
  "14526": "Ah, yes, where is my sister?",
  "14527": "And you mean to say the little thing is very fascinating, I suppose?",
  "14528": "All of whom will call one another citizens?",
  "14529": "And was that how it all ended?",
  "14530": "Perhaps you had better let me pay up, or they'll think we've run away?",
  "14531": "Where is the necessity of this hallucination?",
  "14532": "Ain't it yours too, father?",
  "14533": "Why should YOU take it on yourself?",
  "14534": "Am I like her?",
  "14535": "Is he to be compelled to do so?",
  "14536": "Again?",
  "14537": "You don't mean the infant phenomenon?",
  "14538": "But who ever reflects that, for certain boys, an unjust imposition may be as great a pang as the death of a friend in later years?",
  "14539": "Spirit, are they yours?",
  "14540": "What difference is it to you?",
  "14541": "Would you have voted what you felt and knew to be a lie?",
  "14542": "Was it climate?",
  "14543": "Who will be a father to him when I die?",
  "14544": "Did she ride the horse?",
  "14545": "Do you say so, miss?",
  "14546": "But, in the first place, how did he manage to enter the convent?",
  "14547": "Are they hoping with our help to triumph over their foes or to be useful to their friends?",
  "14548": "Who fears the fallen dew?",
  "14549": "What counterbalance?",
  "14550": "Why, you did nothing wrong?",
  "14551": "If you know, why don't you tell?",
  "14552": "Aren't you but fifteen?",
  "14553": "Will you permit me, then, to recall another to you?",
  "14554": "Where is your native isle?",
  "14555": "Why aren't you asleep, sir?",
  "14556": "You will not sell it, will you?",
  "14557": "My dearest girl, what is the matter?",
  "14558": "In what respect?",
  "14559": "Maylie?",
  "14560": "Why were the holy relics, the arms, ammunition, gunpowder, and stores of corn not removed?",
  "14561": "How long has he been away?",
  "14562": "And dogs are deteriorated in the good qualities of dogs, and not of horses?",
  "14563": "How do you know that it was the same fiacre?",
  "14564": "But to whom did you say them?",
  "14565": "But if, now, a disaster were to happen?",
  "14566": "May not the darkness hide it from my face?",
  "14567": "Now, have a turn with me?",
  "14568": "And you do not guess it?",
  "14569": "Why can't I see in the dark?",
  "14570": "Will it never be day?",
  "14571": "O, then, you are in love with him?",
  "14572": "What sort of a face was I to draw?",
  "14573": "Can you believe so?",
  "14574": "Who made this man my master?",
  "14575": "Why should he have pardoned me, then?",
  "14576": "That is so, is it not?",
  "14577": "How has he got rich?",
  "14578": "What more of the man she had told them of before?",
  "14579": "What can all this mean?",
  "14580": "Of what use would it be?",
  "14581": "It's natural and right for 'em to talk different from each other, ain't it?",
  "14582": "Is it not then strange that thy intelligent part only should be disobedient and discontented with its own place?",
  "14583": "Which are the best coasts?",
  "14584": "You wish to join the colony?",
  "14585": "Was it not his betrothal feast?",
  "14586": "Are you not the precious image of each and all of us men in this whaling world?",
  "14587": "It don't take long, does it?",
  "14588": "Will you always stand that way and wait, until it'll becomes morning, noon, and evening?",
  "14589": "Now, you will go, won't you?",
  "14590": "May I ask the reason of your refusal?",
  "14591": "Does he know where I am, aunt?",
  "14592": "Have you anything?",
  "14593": "What liquor?",
  "14594": "Eh, how can I tell?",
  "14595": "What would he think himself?",
  "14596": "Did he understand too well, or did he not understand at all?",
  "14597": "When will you stop such romping ways?",
  "14598": "Who has not?",
  "14599": "Don't you think that any secret course is an unworthy one?",
  "14600": "And what have you been bringing here?",
  "14601": "Are the others clever, sir?",
  "14602": "Why should he run wild upon the moor?",
  "14603": "What they DO doesn't alter the truth of what they say, does it?",
  "14604": "Is it because it is his duty to be grateful?",
  "14605": "Have you put him to any ransom?",
  "14606": "Charlotte?",
  "14607": "What do you make of them?",
  "14608": "Would you be asking me to break my oath?",
  "14609": "Is there nothing I can do?",
  "14610": "Why don't you go home, then, same's me?",
  "14611": "What was this strange house?",
  "14612": "Do you not go with us?",
  "14613": "Think we're as green as to do you in here, and have the police nosing round?",
  "14614": "Taken in by the servant?",
  "14615": "What will become of us?",
  "14616": "D'you understand?",
  "14617": "And these researches?",
  "14618": "Is it some former admirer who wishes to retire?",
  "14619": "And you fancy that the two matters are connected in some way?",
  "14620": "You'll come with me, won't you?",
  "14621": "Your father, or brother, or your betrothed?",
  "14622": "When do you go, sir?",
  "14623": "What if the boy were really not her son, after all?",
  "14624": "Who are you, pray ?",
  "14625": "Well, granting that, what became of him?",
  "14626": "What put that idea in your head?",
  "14627": "Why did you not put your name to the note?",
  "14628": "He has been fairly in?",
  "14629": "Could you get me a part if I paid?",
  "14630": "What is the time now?",
  "14631": "Where do you go?",
  "14632": "Which lady?",
  "14633": "Oh, will you really?",
  "14634": "Who is the gentleman with the telescope?",
  "14635": "Why, indeed?",
  "14636": "That is his meaning then?",
  "14637": "And 'What will you take for the geese?",
  "14638": "Promise not to repeat?",
  "14639": "Are ye tuck sick, or what's come over ye?",
  "14640": "Tell me, why does a steward rob his master?",
  "14641": "Have you no regard for true merit, you malignant fellow?",
  "14642": "And last night he was with us so happy, so cheerful, so affectionate?",
  "14643": "It is not all a question of goods?",
  "14644": "Therefore is my freedom lawful, however proper it may be?",
  "14645": "Were they swept into eternity by a freshet?",
  "14646": "Besides, where was I to find a person to write the words, and one who would give himself the trouble of turning the poetry to my liking?",
  "14647": "Is it in any way different from other schools?",
  "14648": "And what harm if he did talk?",
  "14649": "Us, who have wings and fly?",
  "14650": "A grey mare?",
  "14651": "What effect had this frightful shock produced?",
  "14652": "And he acquiesced?",
  "14653": "So you would advise a knife to his throat?",
  "14654": "How dare you touch that coronet?",
  "14655": "Can't you make it eight?",
  "14656": "What has been decided?",
  "14657": "My dear girl, what have I got to do with her dressing beautifully or looking well?",
  "14658": "Are you speaking seriously, doctor?",
  "14659": "How could that be?",
  "14660": "My companions and myself?",
  "14661": "Do we breakfast or dine?",
  "14662": "Ought any, then, to refuse their aid in doing what good the good of the whole demands?",
  "14663": "Would the stranger one day speak of it?",
  "14664": "What may my father wish to convey?",
  "14665": "At the rate of, sir?",
  "14666": "When did you say he died?",
  "14667": "Well, when is her birthday?",
  "14668": "Is there any political power to authorize such interference?",
  "14669": "Now do you understand?",
  "14670": "And it was she, I presume, who mentioned your name?",
  "14671": "Is that where you live, my little lady?",
  "14672": "Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it?",
  "14673": "Where d' you live, sir?",
  "14674": "Are you come out as against a thief, with swords and staves to take me?",
  "14675": "Do you repent?",
  "14676": "Is the water always turbid?",
  "14677": "Was there nothing to be done?",
  "14678": "Say ye so?",
  "14679": "Well, what is it you really want of me?",
  "14680": "Who shall be the judge of merit?",
  "14681": "How now, nephew?",
  "14682": "Have I forgot my noble birth?",
  "14683": "Well, what shall you do with this money, count?",
  "14684": "Well, what are the names of the patriarchs?",
  "14685": "Have I clearly explained the class which I mean?",
  "14686": "Where can he have been hidden?",
  "14687": "Where did you bring him from?",
  "14688": "How can your lordship imagine that you could ever inconvenience me?",
  "14689": "How did you come here?",
  "14690": "I suppose he never knew me?",
  "14691": "Why did you drive me to such extremities?",
  "14692": "But why should such an idea cross your mind?",
  "14693": "You couldn't take me, could you?",
  "14694": "But how are we to come by the men?",
  "14695": "What can I fear while shielded by protection at once so loving and so powerful?",
  "14696": "When was I in a fearful state?",
  "14697": "Shall I commit adultery?",
  "14698": "What has become of him?",
  "14699": "In that case, monseigneur, do you believe the cardinal will be so kind as to tell me what has become of my wife?",
  "14700": "Can he be sure that the two are necessarily in accord?",
  "14701": "Was there no mention made of me in the letter?",
  "14702": "Are not these beggarly devils sufficiently wretched already?",
  "14703": "Were you ever at sea, before?",
  "14704": "But what did you mean to take?",
  "14705": "Have strangers leave with us to get their wealth?",
  "14706": "If she bleeds to death, is that my fault?",
  "14707": "You are going to leave us after I have become so accustomed to you?",
  "14708": "Can it be done?",
  "14709": "Is she your child?",
  "14710": "What if by endeavouring to place her in the position of a lady, he had falsely so placed her, and robbed her of her legitimate position?",
  "14711": "Am I come to a friend?",
  "14712": "What befals him dead?",
  "14713": "Which way heading?",
  "14714": "Then what shall I gain, pray?",
  "14715": "How do you suppose you can carry on like this?",
  "14716": "Whose service would that be?",
  "14717": "What does all this flight of imagination mean?",
  "14718": "Vansuythen?",
  "14719": "What in the world do you s'pose that is?",
  "14720": "Is our little neighbor worse?",
  "14721": "Where have I been brought to?",
  "14722": "Nor the blue bed?",
  "14723": "My good sir, what is the matter with you, O father?",
  "14724": "How long will it be first?",
  "14725": "Why has she given up sending the children and coming to see us?",
  "14726": "Who is this?",
  "14727": "Is dat you, honey?",
  "14728": "Garth?",
  "14729": "Where do your brothers and sisters live?",
  "14730": "How can I take this stranger into my house?",
  "14731": "Then don't you know how it was?",
  "14732": "Who is it you wish to see?",
  "14733": "Why is it that she speaks to him of about your welfare and your position, as she clearly has done?",
  "14734": "How will that do?",
  "14735": "But why shall I say more?",
  "14736": "I wonder if you will forgive me?",
  "14737": "But with what object?",
  "14738": "Where is the girl?",
  "14739": "You imagined I didn't know you had your watch again?",
  "14740": "And what kind of woman, and of what age is she?",
  "14741": "Prunes?",
  "14742": "How came you to be there?",
  "14743": "And where might it be now?",
  "14744": "Now, how on earth could you know that the stolen silver was at the bottom of that pond?",
  "14745": "There are no villages here?",
  "14746": "What at?",
  "14747": "Something that you would like done, is it not?",
  "14748": "Was that all?",
  "14749": "Will you not let me look at it also?",
  "14750": "And are things in order?",
  "14751": "How about the fireplace?",
  "14752": "Why, what is the matter?",
  "14753": "And what did you say?",
  "14754": "Who is right and who is wrong?",
  "14755": "But if a man had a danger hanging over him, and knew what it was, don't you think he would turn to the police for protection?",
  "14756": "How did it show itself?",
  "14757": "When is this accomplished?",
  "14758": "And have you them yet?",
  "14759": "Did I take this yesterday?",
  "14760": "Will any private training enable him to stand firm against the overwhelming flood of popular opinion?",
  "14761": "Why would ye let such beauty wither?",
  "14762": "What may YOUR game be, ma'am?",
  "14763": "But what does it show?",
  "14764": "Or hear, except with the ear?",
  "14765": "What is the wind?",
  "14766": "It wasn't your fault so why should you mind?",
  "14767": "What must I answer?",
  "14768": "Is there any talk yet of who is to run?",
  "14769": "Must it be so?",
  "14770": "But what can we do?",
  "14771": "Why did you push yourself in there by daylight?",
  "14772": "And does not marriage mean motherhood?",
  "14773": "Don't you belong to the barricade?",
  "14774": "And what do you suppose the master will think when I display it before him?",
  "14775": "Hand over, will you?",
  "14776": "And think there was to you no conscience of the housebreaker, what would you do?",
  "14777": "What is it that you will not do?",
  "14778": "And whither go we, my father?",
  "14779": "What vault?",
  "14780": "By asking advice instead of exerting the judgment?",
  "14781": "Another one, eh?",
  "14782": "Who are they that carry it?",
  "14783": "For what can be the meaning of a truly wise man wanting to fly away and lightly leave a master who is better than himself?",
  "14784": "You think, probably, that I roam around, and get into all sorts of evil?",
  "14785": "Why weren't you at the races yesterday?",
  "14786": "But fly whither?",
  "14787": "May it be that I see you?",
  "14788": "Yes, count, you know what I told you?",
  "14789": "And what kind of a man?",
  "14790": "What have you killed a man for, you thief?",
  "14791": "Have you heard what has happened?",
  "14792": "Does the king exile me?",
  "14793": "And who is that pale young man beside him?",
  "14794": "Yes, isn't it, dear?",
  "14795": "What more need be said?",
  "14796": "Will no danger threaten him?",
  "14797": "How can you reconcile it to your conscience, I wonder, to prejudice my own boy against me, or against anybody who is dear to me?",
  "14798": "Nor of any other such person?",
  "14799": "Will your excellency deign to open it?",
  "14800": "Who amongst us is there that does not recollect similar hours of bitter, bitter childish grief?",
  "14801": "What had he really gained by all this trouble?",
  "14802": "And what was his reply?",
  "14803": "Shall I row you ashore?",
  "14804": "Have I been talking in my sleep?",
  "14805": "Where now?",
  "14806": "The beginning or the end?",
  "14807": "Indeed, where could we stop?",
  "14808": "Wasn't it a lovely place?",
  "14809": "He is dead, is he not?",
  "14810": "The name of my clerk?",
  "14811": "Will you call for the money, or shall I send it?",
  "14812": "But how to get rid of him?",
  "14813": "Who's going?",
  "14814": "How is the queen?",
  "14815": "So you refuse my request?",
  "14816": "You wonder what?",
  "14817": "And who is that other person?",
  "14818": "Rheumatism, sir?",
  "14819": "Am I my brother's keeper?",
  "14820": "What do you mean by early?",
  "14821": "Would they be likely to get rid of seven men out of eight from their own gang and retain only the eighth man?",
  "14822": "You will go to the city and make money, eh?",
  "14823": "Do you think he had planned this robbery, when he went with you to the lodging?",
  "14824": "O, is your bundle ready?",
  "14825": "Real friends?",
  "14826": "Will you never get on to your job?",
  "14827": "And about what?",
  "14828": "You owe her her wages, I suppose?",
  "14829": "Do you know what you have said?",
  "14830": "Balderstone?",
  "14831": "I am having a room got ready for you here, and will you please come round at once on getting this?",
  "14832": "But we owe something in this house?",
  "14833": "And what about afterwards?",
  "14834": "But where will we be tomorrow?",
  "14835": "What advice?",
  "14836": "Who told her?",
  "14837": "Remarkable for what?",
  "14838": "Is it not what happens to every one?",
  "14839": "But how is it she does not think of it herself?",
  "14840": "Who may it be for?",
  "14841": "I say, laddie, you don't object if I sing slightly from time to time during the journey?",
  "14842": "What makes you weep, mama?",
  "14843": "Where is his office?",
  "14844": "What do you mean by that question?",
  "14845": "If this is the great evil of being alone, then what is good and what is evil?",
  "14846": "Have you any arms?",
  "14847": "Are they in possession of our letters?",
  "14848": "Do you observe this gallery, or rather lobby, indeed?",
  "14849": "When will you do that?",
  "14850": "And will not the words and the character of the style depend on the temper of the soul?",
  "14851": "Do you not think that it would be regrettable if we had met in vain?",
  "14852": "Why did she come?",
  "14853": "Is it not safe e'en to encounter him?",
  "14854": "Did any haberdasher ever look so smirking?",
  "14855": "But what degree of intensity will overbalance what period of duration?",
  "14856": "Couldn't we enlarge it, hollow it out, make openings to let in light and air?",
  "14857": "How can I desire children?",
  "14858": "Would I only come and look at the range?",
  "14859": "What is the prisoner's name?",
  "14860": "Well, hasn't it made it exactly what we wanted?",
  "14861": "How can there be any secrecy, when everything is known to all of us?",
  "14862": "You won't carry me off in your bags, will ye, master?",
  "14863": "Where is your master's diocese?",
  "14864": "Why did he so?",
  "14865": "What was it, my own mother?",
  "14866": "But when you held her in your power, why did you not drown her, strangle her, hang her?",
  "14867": "But by whom will Z be paid for the loss caused him by the profit charged by A in the beginning?",
  "14868": "Perhaps, sir, you don't like the ship?",
  "14869": "Do you think I'd let him imagine for a minute that anything he said could influence me in my public duty?",
  "14870": "Is she safe?",
  "14871": "Have I offended you?",
  "14872": "Then you are on guard every day?",
  "14873": "But this castle, then?",
  "14874": "You know him, then?",
  "14875": "What, said he, I wonder, will the good old couple say to it?",
  "14876": "My hand?",
  "14877": "You consider it, then, perfectly unworthy of a woman to love a man who does not adore her?",
  "14878": "Why are you upset?",
  "14879": "Have you anything to ask of me?",
  "14880": "I've accepted your dismissal, and you managed it as cruelly as you could, and I have made you respect my sex, haven't I?",
  "14881": "What must I do?",
  "14882": "You have formed some conclusion?",
  "14883": "Was not the observation of the chief only what might have been expected?",
  "14884": "What right have I to betray the confidence reposed in me, when nothing but a miracle can prevent this sacrifice?",
  "14885": "Can't you be generous and unselfish enough to face whatever trial there may be for you in this bit of a coincidence?",
  "14886": "How did she come there?",
  "14887": "Now, don't you think the lad would be handsomer cropped?",
  "14888": "Who could have told that such a hurricane had been let loose on the surface of that ocean?",
  "14889": "What is the result at present?",
  "14890": "Were you never taught to say your prayers?",
  "14891": "Well, said he, who next?",
  "14892": "Is it suppression?",
  "14893": "Then they will quarrel as those who intend some day to be reconciled?",
  "14894": "Where is the pain?",
  "14895": "Why did you take the axe along?",
  "14896": "How was it done?",
  "14897": "And why are you all alone?",
  "14898": "The scene which followed, who can describe?",
  "14899": "Where would you have been, my dear, if I hadn't meddled with YOU?",
  "14900": "Where does he expect me to get it?",
  "14901": "Did you call, sir?",
  "14902": "Where, then, is your enthusiasm?",
  "14903": "Do you wish it?",
  "14904": "Do you really think so, doctor?",
  "14905": "Oh, is that all?",
  "14906": "Is the point of my mantle in the middle, and have I looped my dress evenly?",
  "14907": "Fifty dollars?",
  "14908": "Why, are you afraid of those fowls?",
  "14909": "What, do you not know your house?",
  "14910": "And on what day did he meet his death?",

  "15319": "If we're lads, what does he call himself?",
  "15320": "Why threepence?",
  "15321": "But do you care about them?",
  "15322": "I now know you are all right, and what can I wish for more?",
  "15323": "But if this indemnity is refused me, what do I, a proletaire, care for the tranquillity and security of the rich?",
  "15324": "Why may not our country at some time average as many?",
  "15325": "What is thy news?",
  "15326": "Does it hurt?",
  "15327": "And what, after all, is the security which this training gives to governments?",
  "15328": "Now what are you going to do?",

  "15348": "Have not some of the intriguers put it into his head that I regard him with jealousy?",
  "15349": "Knowing all, how could she be drawn back under the man's fascination?",
  "15350": "On what mischief was the young fiend bent now?",

  "15386": "For of what other common political community will any one say that the whole human race are members?",
  "15387": "Now, then, what did you do to your hair?",
  "15388": "Why do you pish, captain?",
  "15389": "And what would be the use of behaving otherwise?",
  "15390": "Isn't that shameful, isn't that humiliating?",
  "15391": "Cousin, will you any tobacco?",
  "15392": "Why not think much about this mansion?",
  "15393": "Is it his child?",
  "15394": "How do you say it?",
  "15395": "Who's been telling you that?",
  "15396": "How like you this?",

  "15403": "Is it really only negative?",
  "15404": "HIS father?",
  "15405": "Of what sort could a woman be who wrote such a letter as that?",
  "15406": "You acknowledge that as your conviction on the subject?",
  "15407": "And why should I?",
  "15408": "Diamonds on de moon, eh?",
  "15409": "And is it just to assail, condemn, or despise them for doing so?",
  "15410": "Could her mother own it if she did?",
  "15411": "Who killed them?",
  "15412": "Now, can you?",
  "15413": "Well, what is there so astonishing in that?",
  "15414": "What, will he deal upon such quantities of wine, alone?",
  "15415": "Why, it may be asked, have all the most eminent living naturalists and geologists rejected this view of the mutability of species?",
  "15416": "Besides, what's the good of criticism?",
  "15417": "Do you think a woman could go alone at that hour to a bachelor's house?",

  "15584": "Do you see anything to the contrary?",
  "15585": "Could he not turn his having lost all into an opportunity?",
  "15586": "What do you want HER to know how you are for?",
  "15587": "But is it true that I have but a fortnight of life left to me?",
  "15588": "Who ARE you?",
  "15589": "Must I do so?",
  "15590": "Well, then, why do you wish me to give up seeing such a man?",
  "15591": "You are sure he will keep his word with me?",
  "15592": "And is there any man in whom you will find more of this sort of misery than in the tyrannical man, who is in a fury of passions and desires?",
  "15593": "Well then, can't you answer?",
  "15594": "But why destroy my friends?",

  "15720": "What is that, grandmother?",
  "15721": "How would he feel when he met her again, in her poor ruined home?",
  "15722": "Well, now, gentlemen, is not that very alarming?",
  "15723": "What then became of me?",
  "15724": "How no rent?",
  "15725": "You sleep in this room, then?",
  "15726": "Where did you hide it?",
  "15727": "And have women, who have early imbibed notions of passive obedience, sufficient character to manage a family or educate children?",
  "15728": "Do you know her name?",
  "15729": "But wouldn't the shot be heard at the inn or somewhere?",
  "15730": "But suppose we HAD gone through the ceremony?",
  "15731": "Are you, indeed, going there?",
  "15732": "Well, is she there?",
  "15733": "Do you know will he be long, sir?",
  "15734": "Which side ought he to take?",
  "15735": "You were guarding me?",
  "15736": "Can he praestare fidem datam?",
  "15737": "Of monuments?",
  "15738": "Would she not tell you?",
  "15739": "Is it man or beast?",
  "15740": "Do you fly?",
  "15741": "What do you want among us now?",
  "15742": "Shall I respect man when he condemns me?",
  "15743": "What is he doing?",
  "15744": "What shall I put you down for?",
  "15745": "Or what?",
  "15746": "What is your badge?",
  "15747": "And when the body is hungry, against eating?",

  "15770": "But is this really so?",
  "15771": "Have I called you down from the stars?",
  "15772": "For how much?",
  "15773": "But what do you want with me?",
  "15774": "Is not that quite enough?",
  "15775": "Say he need not lose his children and his wife, will he love you for that more than one who knows he well deserved the loss?",
  "15776": "Or had it transformed itself into this man, and what did the whole thing mean?",
  "15777": "Do you know anything of the commissionnaire?",
  "15778": "Through marriage?",
  "15779": "And do you impute it to either of those?",
  "15780": "Is she not perhaps still a married woman with a living husband?",
  "15781": "Is there never another to be found in the world?",
  "15782": "What's that, captain?",
  "15783": "Did you ever spend a quieter night in our little house at Königsberg?",
  "15784": "In nailing up the coffin?",
  "15785": "Have you enough till I come back?",
  "15786": "Are they better than gold pieces?",
  "15787": "Wel, what of him?",
  "15788": "Why all these complaints?",
  "15789": "If he does not boast of his deeds, who will?",

  "15792": "A gift?",
  "15793": "Blood is thicker than water, isn't it?",
  "15794": "But, my dear, will you not give us a little hope of touching this heart, so kind and generous?",
  "15795": "An't you?",
  "15796": "Then why do you keep thinking about it?",
  "15797": "What's the use of talking?",
  "15798": "Has he?",
  "15799": "Aren't you ashamed of yourself?",
  "15800": "What say you then?",
  "15801": "Do you reflect that all those words will be branded in my memory, and eating deeper eternally after you have left me?",
  "15802": "What example?",
  "15803": "Do you know him personally?",
  "15804": "You cannot mean to shoot me?",
  "15805": "Why does he never write?",
  "15806": "What do girls do who haven't any mothers to help them through their troubles?",
  "15807": "I don't know what you mean?",
  "15808": "Are they not a race contemptuous of others?",
  "15809": "Why did she seem so abstracted?",
  "15810": "The pony?",
  "15811": "What men be ye?",
  "15812": "The short and long of it is, men, will ye spit fire or not?",
  "15813": "Who had done this?",

  "15817": "Why do you not go to the inn?",
  "15818": "But tell me, whence comes this fortune?",
  "15819": "What'll we do?",
  "15820": "Mamma, from whom was that other letter which you got this morning?",
  "15821": "Which one of you knows whether I have said it or no?",
  "15822": "Has she ever seen you before?",
  "15823": "Whose heart, for all thy wiles, is ever pure?",
  "15824": "What do they matter to us?",
  "15825": "Must I be subject to this merciless villain?",
  "15826": "Don't you imagine he would make a better soup?",
  "15827": "Is your roaguery become an office, with a knaues name?",
  "15828": "Did you expect me to believe you, princess?",
  "15829": "Would you seriously object to my bringing the child over here, with its mother?",
  "15830": "He doesn't show violence, does he?",
  "15831": "You've not forgotten all your doctoring, have you?",
  "15832": "How could you see her suffering and allow it to continue?",
  "15833": "What will happen if she is guilty?",
  "15834": "You wouldn't relapse, if you were going out?",
  "15835": "Ah, is there a secret spring?",
  "15836": "How did you get such a wee wee waist?",
  "15837": "Can't you pull the lever over faster?",

  "15844": "The hansom cab one?",
  "15845": "Did you go far?",
  "15846": "To whom are you referring?",
  "15847": "Shall I tell you how bad a place it is to pass?",
  "15848": "Has he sent no particular message for me?",
  "15849": "Why do you then doubt of that which you know not?",
  "15850": "Shan't I give you a piece of anything at all, miss?",
  "15851": "May it be told?",
  "15852": "On this rock?",
  "15853": "But the marks?",
  "15854": "Why should he not declare himself, or at least try to find some encouragement?",
  "15855": "What are you reading?",
  "15856": "Ithamore, tell me, is the friar asleep?",
  "15857": "And with whom are they to meet there?",
  "15858": "Or an inheritor?",
  "15859": "Tis not my son disguised?",

  "15867": "You can milk 'em clean, my maidy?",
  "15868": "Wouldn't there?",
  "15869": "Are they overboard?",
  "15870": "But will that be long?",
  "15871": "A new disease, and many troubled with it?",
  "15872": "A'n't you all as rich in your ways as he in his?",
  "15873": "Vholes?",
  "15874": "Is that sure?",
  "15875": "What can I do with them?",
  "15876": "Under these circumstances was it possible for them to retain even the shadow of a hope?",
  "15877": "And do you mean to say, then, that you have had any acquaintance with her since you came from abroad?",
  "15878": "Want to set yourself up for a dandy, I suppose, and think that you must souse that speckled face of yours into every brook you come to?",
  "15879": "We could hardly pretend to be strangers, could we?",
  "15880": "Is the mind then, which, in proportion to its dignity advances more slowly towards perfection, to be treated with less respect?",

  "15951": "Baisemeaux?",
  "15952": "Well, am I anybody?",
  "15953": "Hear it?",
  "15954": "Have you not seen him, sir?",
  "15955": "Are you quite alone?",
  "15956": "That is a gallant proposal, and a gallant man, is he not, duke?",
  "15957": "Did they quite die?",
  "15958": "Are not philosophy and religion humanity's education?",
  "15959": "Oh, what shall I do, what shall I do?",
  "15960": "But didn't you cut it almost too short?",
  "15961": "Who taught them the trick of tyranny?",

  "15967": "Are you really conscious, love, of what you're saying?",
  "15968": "And how has it all happened?",
  "15969": "Then we shall want merchants?",
  "15970": "Were not his disposition, mind, character, acquirements, all such as women most delight to love?",
  "15971": "And how could you believe he was my lover?",
  "15972": "Having settled then that he was to tell a lie, what lie should he tell?",
  "15973": "But how can you be sure that the path you show is the true path?",
  "15974": "Could we even tell what might occur during the march?",
  "15975": "Then we must abstain from spoiling the dead or hindering their burial?",
  "15976": "He's decently well off himself, isn't he?",

  "15992": "Whatever have you done, darling?",
  "15993": "If I am a prisoner, what crime have I committed?",
  "15994": "And if she was ugly, what question more awkward both to put and to answer?",
  "15995": "If they did not want it why did they not merely throw it into the water?",
  "15996": "While the rain descends so, must I lay my head on the cold, drenched ground?",
  "15997": "Do you think he disliked her seeing him at our house?",
  "15998": "Well, how d'you do, my dear fellow?",
  "15999": "What was left of the little world he had grown up in, and whose standards had bent and bound him?",
  "16000": "Rather than wait, to make sure?",

  "16005": "Could she refuse sometimes to answer that beseeching look which she felt to be following her like a low murmur of love and pain?",
  "16006": "He was alive yesterday evening, wasn't he?",
  "16007": "But his brain?",
  "16008": "Why else should he have shewn such unwillingness to accept your invitation here?",
  "16009": "Thy fate unpitied, and thy rites unpaid?",
  "16010": "And her name?",
  "16011": "Or would the men, as broader men, merely have to revise some of their moral judgments?",
  "16012": "But none of you would go?",
  "16013": "And yet you have spoken to her?",
  "16014": "Got here safe, did you?",
  "16015": "Have you no comforts?",
  "16016": "One of your friends?",
  "16017": "But who is he?",
  "16018": "Aren't you a little hoarse?",
  "16019": "What do you suppose, my friend, and how ought I to answer them?",
  "16020": "A steam machine?",
  "16021": "What should they decide?",
  "16022": "You had the first prize for geography, my boy?",
  "16023": "Why had he sentenced her to death?",
  "16024": "You knew we were there and yet wished to kill your friend the chevalier?",
  "16025": "What are you doing in my home?",
  "16026": "Will he get it now, I wonder, and in what form?",
  "16027": "What's the fete?",
  "16028": "If I disappear, what happens?",
  "16029": "Give thanks, and rob thy own afflicted poor?",
  "16030": "Names down on the papers?",
  "16031": "Didn't you let me go for a pirate?",
  "16032": "And now that each is trying to break the contract, in what do they differ?",
  "16033": "Now, are not the best husbandmen those who are most devoted to husbandry?",
  "16034": "What did it matter to him?",
  "16035": "You have been watching us from behind that bush?",
  "16036": "Besides, would the princess have me?",
  "16037": "Is it a tinker you are?",
  "16038": "And why in lilac precisely?",
  "16039": "Before we go, do you mind if I look in your pocket?",
  "16040": "Can we do away with the special claims of family, of neighborhood, of the state?",
  "16041": "What was it, sir?",
  "16042": "Caxton?",
  "16043": "Is she gone?",

  "16051": "What is thy name, lad?",
  "16052": "Do you suppose I eat like an ogre or a ghoul, that you dread being the companion of my repast?",
  "16053": "Who can see so far?",
  "16054": "What's the moon to a man like me?",
  "16055": "Assingham?",
  "16056": "Shall we refer to them again?",
  "16057": "Why do you call me princess?",

  "16061": "If I had forgiven it, ought he to have spoken?",
  "16062": "Should we distrust the man because his manners are not our manners, and that his skin is dark?",
  "16063": "Or was I right?",
  "16064": "It smells comforting, doesn't it?",
  "16065": "How should I?",
  "16066": "Is there anything in the jungle too little to be killed?",
  "16067": "How are you, anyhow?",
  "16068": "Do you understand me?",

  "16071": "You were sent by some other person?",
  "16072": "Who are you, then?",
  "16073": "Is it all there?",
  "16074": "Where did you find her?",
  "16075": "What is that in your hand?",

  "16083": "You followed her?",
  "16084": "Shall we have champagne?",
  "16085": "Half a million, is it?",
  "16086": "Tell me, then, madame, why have you been so harsh these three or four months past?",
  "16087": "Who told you all you know about me?",
  "16088": "And of the objects which are being carried in like manner they would only see the shadows?",
  "16089": "Brother?",
  "16090": "You like my cigar, eh?",
  "16091": "Booty?",
  "16092": "And who was the father to be so obeyed?",

  "16103": "Whoever heard of such a thing, talking away?",
  "16104": "Calm?",
  "16105": "And on the morning of the wedding?",
  "16106": "Do you forget that the needs of the morrow must be high, not to speak of the outlay for the day?",
  "16107": "Was it possible he had done these things?",
  "16108": "Is what you tell me true?",
  "16109": "And is there a large force of you here?",
  "16110": "But, perhaps, you have disposed of the coachman as well as the horses?",

  "16796": "What's the start?",
  "16797": "Besides, what did I ask of you?",
  "16798": "Where is the objection?",
  "16799": "But don't you think it's making rather heavy weather over a trifle?",
  "16800": "Ah, what?",

  "16912": "Do you think yourself my master, that you try to keep me under lock and key like this?",
  "16913": "A client, then?",
  "16914": "Well now, don't we do anything for this old country of ours?",
  "16915": "Will you introduce me to her some time, if I call?",
  "16916": "And the dog?",
  "16917": "Did he call out because he landed in the water, do you think?",

  "20913": "What ails ye?",
  "20914": "Who wants me?",
  "20915": "Or till the soil?",
  "20916": "What are you sulky for?",
  "20917": "Do you go out much in society?",
  "20918": "Say, only you two?",
  "20919": "What will our two friends say?",
  "20920": "Why, isn't it obvious?",
  "20921": "What's the use of thinking you can stop people drinking merely by cutting off whiskey and brandy?",
  "20922": "Had seven long years, under the torture of the scarlet letter, inflicted so much of misery and wrought out no repentance?",
  "20923": "Can you handle the rifle?",
  "20924": "Yes, of course, but which rules?",
  "20925": "Have they, by some miraculous instinct or foresight, set apart in each of them a common place of residence?",
  "20926": "But still, papa, you'll have the dear old house and garden?",
  "20927": "Shall we meet again?",
  "20928": "What answer did you give your friend, sir?",
  "20929": "If we have been angels, why have we fallen lower?",
  "20930": "Came where?",
  "20931": "Any steps?",
  "20932": "If we can do so safely, why should we not?",
  "20933": "What question?",
  "20934": "Have you not a wheel that you can sell me?",
  "20935": "What did he see?",
  "20936": "Why did I not step forward to comfort and protect him?",
  "20937": "Where is she now?",
  "20938": "And how much money is wanting to complete the purchase?",
  "20939": "Will you listen to me for a moment?",
  "20940": "Make their acquaintance?",
  "20941": "Do you know why I'm going today instead of tomorrow?",
  "20942": "Whom does he consider disinterested?",
  "20943": "What bargain are you talking about?",
  "20944": "What is nobler than to succour those we love?",
  "20945": "How do you defend them?",
  "20946": "Colbert?",
  "20947": "How have I?",
  "20948": "It's very ingenious, and she says several pretty things in the process, but what's gained, I'd like to know?",
  "20949": "But who else was there?",
  "20950": "Do I look a sight?",
  "20951": "How can you talk about being like a book, when it makes even me, an outsider, feel sick?",
  "20952": "Did you know him well?",
  "20953": "Who should take the heads off the knot but the man that put the heads on?",
  "20954": "Where do you set?",
  "20955": "But, what then?",
  "20956": "Will you answer me, sir?",
  "20957": "Are there no boys at the farm?",
  "20958": "And pray what do you call such an action?",
  "20959": "No money?",
  "20960": "What do I know about it?",
  "20961": "Am I not right?",
  "20962": "Why should he hold his tongue?",
  "20963": "If you did not feel that it was wrong, why did you join in providing that men should be hung for it?",
  "20964": "Your father walks rather too quick for you, don't he, my man?",
  "20965": "Are not your name, your social position, and your merit sufficient?",
  "20966": "Why are you so unhappy, mother?",
  "20967": "And did you give me tobacco yesterday?",
  "20968": "For the last time, I ask you, will you reply to my questions?",
  "20969": "Who is this?",
  "20970": "Whence I came?",
  "20971": "Suppose he did all this, what then?",
  "20972": "How is it with you?",
  "20973": "Who is that girl?",
  "20974": "What can she have said?",
  "20975": "Must I see my poor chile' go after all my hope to save her?",
  "20976": "Someone else?",
  "20977": "That conveys nothing to you?",
  "20978": "And how was he to meet her again on this very day?",
  "20979": "Who the devil prevents you?",
  "20980": "Then why will you not be my wife?",
  "20981": "In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?",
  "20982": "But who else COULD it be, my very dear prince?",
  "20983": "Do you think it would be unfriendly of me if I said I was busy?",
  "20984": "How old is she?",
  "20985": "WILL you shake hands?",
  "20986": "Can't they do anything to help me?",
  "20987": "Did you ever hear of a dog running up a curtain?",
  "20988": "What is all my world after?",
  "20989": "And suppose he should say all he knows?",
  "20990": "Whether they are going to convict, or whatever it is, that dreadful soldier?",
  "20991": "Do you see this diamond?",
  "20992": "Why did he not go?",
  "20993": "Who was this man who held in his finger these curiously variegated links of an unknown chain?",
  "20994": "How much may not a few months do?",
  "20995": "What would this chamber of justice do?",
  "20996": "Well, yes, you are right, I am a fool, why not simply remain here?",
  "20997": "Are you going to shoot me?",
  "20998": "Oh, do you know that it is cruel never to name the name of the loved one?",
  "20999": "Couldn't one do anything for her?",
  "21000": "Is he quiet?",
  "21001": "A girl, is it?",
  "21002": "Shall a curiosity, which seems to lead nowhere, be satisfied?",
  "21003": "Was there no injustice in this?",
  "21004": "A dead dog, or rabbits, or what?",
  "21005": "Have you plotted to drown me?",
  "21006": "Oh, where was he?",
  "21007": "If I might make a suggestion, sir?",
  "21008": "What decision?",
  "21009": "Have you a mind to go ashore there?",
  "21010": "From number sixty?",
  "21011": "Or was the projectile nothing now but a metal coffin, bearing three corpses into space?",
  "21012": "What is the difficulty?",
  "21013": "How could you shut me out, bear it all alone?",
  "21014": "Would it be an indiscretion to ask to see those precious pills?",
  "21015": "And who is the cause of all this annoyance?",
  "21016": "After this, what more can be wanted?",
  "21017": "Tame?",
  "21018": "Will you take these mementos to him?",
  "21019": "And WHERE has he gone?",
  "21020": "But what is the point of it?",
  "21021": "And what good is it to the bubble while it holds together, or what harm when it is burst?",
  "21022": "What are you going to do with yourselves after you get settled?",
  "21023": "Is that it, my dear?",
  "21024": "If one is not to get into a rage sometimes, what is the good of being friends?",
  "21025": "Where shall I put all this treasure, and which way shall I go?",
  "21026": "Aren't you afraid to be wicked?",
  "21027": "Why not mention these almost divinely childish sayings of kindness?",
  "21028": "Awake?",
  "21029": "Bucket?",
  "21030": "WHICH one is the poet?",
  "21031": "What if her nerve had given way under the strain?",
  "21032": "That's about what YOU are, you know, ain't you?",
  "21033": "What are you up to, little man?",
  "21034": "Don't you see the rain is coming on?",
  "21035": "More powerful than my mother, then?",
  "21036": "Do you know, all through dinner I had a kind of rummy idea that there was something I'd forgotten, but I couldn't think what?",
  "21037": "You are convinced?",
  "21038": "Yes, why?",
  "21039": "Where did she live?",
  "21040": "Good?",
  "21041": "You love me?",
  "21042": "Why are you so impatient?",
  "21043": "Well, what if it is?",
  "21044": "Shall I ever forget the triple horror of that spectacle?",
  "21045": "Do you deny that?",
  "21046": "Will you turn the hay over to us, the hay in the old stack?",
  "21047": "But aren't there people who cannot pass examinations?",
  "21048": "But that way of arguing by imaginary instances is not supposed to be genuine, is it?",
  "21049": "Or am I going mad?",
  "21050": "What is the price?",
  "21051": "On what shall I reflect?",
  "21052": "So near, are we?",
  "21053": "Didn't a stranger arrive here last night?",
  "21054": "And will it cost much?",
  "21055": "We are not wrong therefore in calling them necessary?",
  "21056": "Gentlemen, did you ever see a scorpion pinned to a wall?",
  "21057": "But what about the lamps?",
  "21058": "But then?",
  "21059": "Isn't it right?",
  "21060": "And me, too?",
  "21061": "I suppose you gave a goodish figure for him?",
  "21062": "A surprise?",
  "21063": "Why cannot we launch into space through the scuttle?",
  "21064": "Is that what you wish for?",
  "21065": "Die for it?",
  "21066": "They must have been mistaken, surely?",
  "21067": "Absolutely?",
  "21068": "Is this the recompense you had in store for me?",
  "21069": "Shall I go and see if I can find them?",
  "21070": "Will you let me try to mend it for you?",
  "21071": "And for ever?",
  "21072": "You whom I regard as the last word, the last charming and delightful word, in modern womanhood?",
  "21073": "To avoid this dilemma what is proposed?",
  "21074": "Well, have there been reviews of your book?",
  "21075": "Kiss any of them?",
  "21076": "Would he really be permitted to lean on his father's broad breast once more?",
  "21077": "Have you had board and lodging too?",
  "21078": "Frequently?",
  "21079": "Hasn't ye 'eard that devil's spawn of a capting an' is mates knockin' the bloomin' lights outen 'arf the crew?",
  "21080": "What might the staying of my blood portend?",
  "21081": "Mother, do you see this?",
  "21082": "Have you so soon forgotten from whom you received the foolish instrument you hold in your hand?",
  "21083": "And don't go to any meeting yourself, do you hear?",
  "21084": "Are periodical visits made to the grave?",
  "21085": "Well, now then, the count?",
  "21086": "Whether he had any accomplices, or whatever the thing is called in the law?",
  "21087": "You think it will come to that?",
  "21088": "Cut a man?",
  "21089": "But is there no mitigating circumstance?",
  "21090": "Who are these gentlemen whom you have brought with you?",
  "21091": "Anything down there about your souls?",
  "21092": "What can she do?",
  "21093": "Is there no remedy for this?",
  "21094": "Is this small saving or frugality?",
  "21095": "In danger from you?",
  "21096": "Was the veil about to be rent?",
  "21097": "What were you saying to this youngster?",
  "21098": "Where have you been hiding yourself, you naughty boy?",
  "21099": "How dare you call me flimsy?",
  "21100": "For if the living spring from any other things, and they too die, must not all things at last be swallowed up in death?",
  "21101": "Had she betrayed him?",
  "21102": "Heart, what will you say if this be the appendix or label to both you indentures?",
  "21103": "Ain't you afraid you'll hurt yourself?",
  "21104": "Witty?",
  "21105": "Did I tell you to come around to day?",
  "21106": "You remember that fellow who came upon the evening before you left us?",
  "21107": "And you did not believe him when he said that?",
  "21108": "How can they?",
  "21109": "And always with the same lady?",
  "21110": "Have you read his article?",
  "21111": "So, then, they drew up the indictments before the king was taken?",
  "21112": "But eternal justice?",
  "21113": "Can you wonder I'm lonesome?",
  "21114": "Is it us?",
  "21115": "Then what do you hope for?",
  "21116": "Is it sweetening yet?",
  "21117": "Should he give to his cowardice the pretext of patriotism?",
  "21118": "What did you let her bring you for?",
  "21119": "Won't you tell me something to allay this terrible anxiety and uncertainty?",
  "21120": "At what solution should he arrive?",
  "21121": "Shall I call up our men from beyond the hill?",
  "21122": "My marriage?",
  "21123": "Hadn't they said all along that all that was needed was a little faith and effort?",
  "21124": "When did such a massacre occur?",
  "21125": "Do you know the town at all?",
  "21126": "Hadn't she wanted to give him the money, and said how very sorry she was?",
  "21127": "Is it because you love her so passionately?",
  "21128": "What is he after?",
  "21129": "Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison?",
  "21130": "Does this oath satisfy you?",
  "21131": "Do you know what you fear most?",
  "21132": "And nothing but them?",
  "21133": "And what did you there?",
  "21134": "Then the guilty person is absolutely in custody?",
  "21135": "For whom the labor?",
  "21136": "What, how, why?",
  "21137": "How am I to know, madam, that in your selection of lovers, you are not equally eccentric?",
  "21138": "Why do ye let us wait thus?",
  "21139": "Didn't he send a message to me?",
  "21140": "Any other point, sir?",
  "21141": "What d' you think o' that?",
  "21142": "What's the odds?",
  "21143": "What are they?",
  "21144": "What vial and what balsam is that?",
  "21145": "Why didn't you toss the man in there?",
  "21146": "How could you, how could you believe it?",
  "21147": "What has happened to the pretty boy?",
  "21148": "But where IS father?",
  "21149": "Are there many new women today?",
  "21150": "How do you know he wasn't here?",
  "21151": "Haven't I the right to talk nonsense?",
  "21152": "Will you let me have another cup?",
  "21153": "Is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think?",
  "21154": "What are you up to, now?",
  "21155": "Shall I have my son a stager now?",
  "21156": "Whither did he go?",
  "21157": "Pratt?",
  "21158": "Would she?",
  "21159": "But I say, you know, she can't be as young as she was once, eh?",
  "21160": "Am I insulting?",
  "21161": "How could he order his public execution, and yet, in his letters to the senate, exculpate himself from the guilt of his death?",
  "21162": "And why are you glad?",
  "21163": "Has she told you?",
  "21164": "Are we to go?",
  "21165": "Can one get married as quickly as that?",
  "21166": "By the way, am I your cousin, or am I not?",
  "21167": "Whose opinion is to decide who are the wisest and best?",

  "21171": "How is it you're defending him?",
  "21172": "A stranger in these parts?",
  "21173": "Was my uncle beside himself?",
  "21174": "Couldn't you stop on for just this year?",
  "21175": "Do you find, sir, said I, that I encouraged his proposal, or do you not?",
  "21176": "Now, governor, the sum?",
  "21177": "But do you know who rescued her?",
  "21178": "Finally, what still remained to be sacrificed?",
  "21179": "Where are you from?",
  "21180": "I wonder who it can be?",
  "21181": "His duty?",
  "21182": "Change the sir to one less poignant?",
  "21183": "What's the use of writing at all if nobody can understand it?",
  "21184": "Another enemy to harass me in my misery?",
  "21185": "Do none suggest themselves?",
  "21186": "And where does one take the air in this island?",
  "21187": "What is that dim outline?",
  "21188": "You have no further doubt, captain, of the nature of the animal?",
  "21189": "Shall we leave the cart in the wood?",
  "21190": "Where, in what manner, was your prisoner found?",
  "21191": "How long has this been going on?",
  "21192": "Have you anything to say to us, my friend, or what do you want?",
  "21193": "General, why have we not had any ices?",
  "21194": "But what have I done?",
  "21195": "Shall we go there?",
  "21196": "Mirabell, did you take exceptions last night?",
  "21197": "What did he think?",
  "21198": "Whom do they hate most?",
  "21199": "Come, now, what are your conditions?",
  "21200": "Was any other bicycle missing?",
  "21201": "What's the good of denying it, my dear?",
  "21202": "Do you think, then, monsieur, that we shall travel faster with two horses apiece?",
  "21203": "A nonentity, sir?",
  "21204": "Did they lose their provisions and starve in the desert?",
  "21205": "But how could she reach it?",
  "21206": "Those who recommend a contempt of mankind, and those who inculcate a reverence for humanity?",
  "21207": "How slowly do the houres theyr numbers spend?",
  "21208": "Do I understand that you will take her with you?",
  "21209": "Great statesmen err, and why not small medical men?",
  "21210": "And none of your people had by chance been to see you?",
  "21211": "Do you not perceive that it would be an agent of safety instead of destruction?",
  "21212": "What's th' good fightin' 'mong ourselves?",
  "21213": "You see no difficulty, heh?",
  "21214": "Will that do?",
  "21215": "For what sin, or for what crime?",
  "21216": "Like any warm water?",
  "21217": "To reflect?",
  "21218": "How does this bear on the case?",
  "21219": "Well, supposing I and the others refused to serve, as you are doing?",
  "21220": "We?",
  "21221": "Can't you hear?",
  "21222": "Which is worse?",
  "21223": "Well, then, what are they FOR?",
  "21224": "Why did you bring me away?",
  "21225": "You've just come?",
  "21226": "She has a pretty face, has she not?",
  "21227": "But would it make his life harder if we were to see each other sometimes?",
  "21228": "You wished to see me, your lordship?",
  "21229": "By the way, DID he beat you?",
  "21230": "How did the man give it you?",
  "21231": "Who lost it?",
  "21232": "Nothing of what?",
  "21233": "And what did these two sovereigns give you in exchange for these magnificent presents?",
  "21234": "If there be no unchanging mirror, bright and clean, bow can there be the various images, unreal and temporary, reflected in it?",
  "21235": "Who are all these people?",
  "21236": "What is it, sir?",
  "21237": "But has she told you nothing?",
  "21238": "Have you no wish in reference to your case?",
  "21239": "Isn't this a prosperous nation?",
  "21240": "Don't know?",
  "21241": "That was the way, was it?",
  "21242": "Pull, can't ye?",
  "21243": "Does she refuse me?",
  "21244": "And now tell me, father, while we are still in friendly country, if you know of any resources that I could make my own?",
  "21245": "What's the matter, are you asleep?",
  "21246": "Was my maternal parent aware, in a word, of my absence from the domiciliary residence?",
  "21247": "As we are imagining what is impossible and absurd, suppose we change the subject?",
  "21248": "Is that what he rang for?",
  "21249": "Where will she go?",
  "21250": "Charley does?",
  "21251": "Do you think they have recognized us?",
  "21252": "Do you release her from her promise?",
  "21253": "Why a battle, in the first place?",
  "21254": "When will you go?",
  "21255": "They have in view practice only, and are always speaking?",
  "21256": "She has told you?",
  "21257": "What then is become of that friendship and confidence, and by what means have I lost them?",
  "21258": "Are you sure he hasn't cheated you?",
  "21259": "Is it a bargain, or is it not?",
  "21260": "Heldar?",
  "21261": "Never even hinted, for instance, that your patron might have views as to your marriage ultimately?",
  "21262": "Do you know of whom I mean to speak?",
  "21263": "So much the worse, is it?",
  "21264": "Don't you know me?",
  "21265": "You would accept?",
  "21266": "They do very well here?",
  "21267": "What was the reason?",
  "21268": "How many have you?",
  "21269": "Shall it be brandy and water?",
  "21270": "How was it, when I saw the personal, the selfish point of view of the voice, that I did not suspect some impostor?",
  "21271": "What should I stay for?",
  "21272": "Do you see this russet?",
  "21273": "What aim, what purpose, what ambition in life have you now?",
  "21274": "How are we to distinguish those that are always valid from others?",
  "21275": "What would that other channel probably be?",
  "21276": "Have you not retained an hotel?",
  "21277": "Was it not very extraordinary that you should do this on the very day when there were these papers inside?",
  "21278": "But would you have any objections to my laying down before the fire?",
  "21279": "How many are of your party?",
  "21280": "Ow d'you know there's going to be a next time?",
  "21281": "Percerin?",
  "21282": "Are you in fear of me still?",
  "21283": "Do I know her?",
  "21284": "Did you know?",
  "21285": "Tell me, are you this young fellow's father?",
  "21286": "Does it?",
  "21287": "Is that far?",
  "21288": "Do you suppose, for a moment, he will not recognise that?",
  "21289": "Have you indeed?",
  "21290": "And his address?",
  "21291": "And yet, what could have happened?",
  "21292": "Will it not, sir?",
  "21293": "Now, why need you do it?",
  "21294": "You have got out insurances on our lives and want to give way with their oars, and pocket the proceeds, do ye?",
  "21295": "If these be the effects of friendship, what are those of enmity?",
  "21296": "How then, upon what conditions, in what sense, can a principle which is its own denial enter into science?",
  "21297": "Why should I kill him?",
  "21298": "Come, when do you wish our marriage to be signed in a vestry?",
  "21299": "The name of this creek, my friends?",
  "21300": "About those three or four gentlemen whom you wish to invite here?",
  "21301": "Why do you want the rest?",
  "21302": "Do your people talk about that too?",
  "21303": "Why can't we always fish from the boat instead of from the dories?",
  "21304": "I suppose you've quite got over it now, haven't you?",
  "21305": "Tulliver?",
  "21306": "What do you do instead?",
  "21307": "Why does your ladyship ask?",
  "21308": "Would they be naughty then?",
  "21309": "Was it a bet?",

  "24127": "Today, almost for the first time, I set to work seriously, and what happened?",
  "24128": "You are there, are you, my friend?",
  "24129": "Who could hope ever to do anything to the satisfaction of the press?",

  "24136": "Haven't you chariot and horses and hounds?",
  "24137": "Oh, that was it?",
  "24138": "How can I be bribed?",
  "24139": "To him or to me?",
  "24140": "Why did you not dissuade him from it?",
  "24141": "Have you anything more to say?",
  "24142": "Any trade?",
  "24143": "What should I do with beans?",

  "24145": "What then shall be done?",
  "24146": "What regulates them?",
  "24147": "Quite sure you can stand it?",
  "24148": "You would not give her pain?",
  "24149": "Tell us, shall we tell her now?",
  "24150": "What am I to call you?",
  "24151": "What do you mean by a struggle?",
  "24152": "How do you do?",
  "24153": "Where'd you get him ?",
  "24154": "Do you wish to take it, and what price will you pay if I let you have the whole of it?",
  "24155": "Is this man in town?",
  "24156": "Any mail?",
  "24157": "D'you ever try it?",
  "24158": "You're playing secretaire?",
  "24159": "And was it really possible and true, that her last darling was to be torn from her?",
  "24160": "What did he care that his aunts were only two ignorant old women?",
  "24161": "Can your name be RUMPELSTILTSKIN?",
  "24162": "Are you not going in, sir?",
  "24163": "Ah, what is that?",
  "24164": "Can you not trust me as a physician when I tell you so?",
  "24165": "Then what, exactly, is your plan for us?",
  "24166": "How did you do that?",
  "24167": "If so, what news?",

  "24212": "How did it begin, when did it all come about?",
  "24213": "Where do you go?",
  "24214": "Well, what is to be done?",
  "24215": "Can you hear a mewing cat?",
  "24216": "Well, isn't it all for her good?",
  "24217": "Have you any opinion to offer, count?",
  "24218": "How long must we stay, do you think?",
  "24219": "What, gossip?",
  "24220": "What is the matter with it?",
  "24221": "But may I be allowed to place the mark for the second shooting?",
  "24222": "Have you ever noticed that all little children are blond?",
  "24223": "And that cavalier, that guest, that nobleman who arrived before she came?",
  "24224": "When am I to wear it?",
  "24225": "What made you go blind that sudden?",
  "24226": "How do you communicate?",
  "24227": "Have you enemies, then?",
  "24228": "Which of them will you test?",
  "24229": "Would you really do that?",
  "24230": "How is your old fellow?",
  "24231": "What bottles?",
  "24232": "Could we not keep it as a secret?",
  "24233": "But proportional to what?",
  "24234": "How did you come here?",
  "24235": "What would these insects eat, if we did not pass this way?",
  "24236": "Your advice, then?",
  "24237": "From the monastery?",
  "24238": "Are you not meditating?",
  "24239": "You don't want to kill me, do you?",
  "24240": "Why otherwise, with such an opportunity, hadn't he demanded it?",
  "24241": "Would you compel such a state of affairs?",
  "24242": "Then how do you know?",
  "24243": "Where must I sleep, then?",
  "24244": "Supposing nobody should ever fetch me, how long would they consent to keep me there?",
  "24245": "You will marry me, won't you?",
  "24246": "And I?",
  "24247": "Are you alone, madam?",
  "24248": "Vulgar?",
  "24249": "Is not this change wrought in your minds a very important change?",
  "24250": "True?",
  "24251": "Shall I run on and stop them?",
  "24252": "What sort of road would that be?",
  "24253": "Is it your intention to go to an hotel, sir?",
  "24254": "Agree with what?",
  "24255": "Shall we go this high very long?",
  "24256": "Up?",
  "24257": "Was it this room?",
  "24258": "How then was thy tail created?",
  "24259": "Anyone shot a fox?",
  "24260": "Then what business is it of yours?",
  "24261": "Dishonorable?",
  "24262": "What is the steamer's name?",
  "24263": "Do you often go to see it?",
  "24264": "Damn me, won't you dance?",
  "24265": "How is it that the convicts are lying yonder dead, in the middle of the enclosure?",
  "24266": "But where should she go?",
  "24267": "You would be afraid to draw such an inference, would you not?",
  "24268": "Why, instead of a revolution, did they not content themselves with a reform?",
  "24269": "Why should you say that?",
  "24270": "And had it ready a nice little pinch of salt to put upon his tail?",
  "24271": "In what direction?",
  "24272": "And why was this?",
  "24273": "Now, did it strike your ladyship that she was like anybody?",
  "24274": "An' s'posin' he does?",
  "24275": "What do you mean to do with him?",
  "24276": "Not caring for their lives, is it?",
  "24277": "Will you promise to sit up with me to bear me company?",
  "24278": "What are you waiting for?",
  "24279": "What bell was that?",
  "24280": "And with you, governor?",
  "24281": "Perhaps you don't know it?",
  "24282": "How came the words forth from her?",
  "24283": "Have I not always fought for your glory and interests?",
  "24284": "What, after all, was this blood of which she had taught herself to think so much?",
  "24285": "How do you do?",
  "24286": "But could it be otherwise?",
  "24287": "Must I compel men to render her fitting honor?",
  "24288": "For who gets wealth, that puts not from the shore?",
  "24289": "You feel, in other words, that she lies to you?",
  "24290": "Who has?",
  "24291": "And what crime has he committed?",
  "24292": "And whom are you waiting for?",
  "24293": "Why not say so?",
  "24294": "Nine, ten, eleven?",
  "24295": "And it was a fierce one?",
  "24296": "Why couldn't he go to his own home?",
  "24297": "What is it they 'ad of you, sir?",
  "24298": "What have you been doing all this time, eh?",
  "24299": "Well, what does that lead up to?",
  "24300": "To whom did he call?",
  "24301": "And what are you?",
  "24302": "Could he be dead?",
  "24303": "Will you be willing to leave your present situation and try?",
  "24304": "What else can we do?",
  "24305": "Had he fallen during the attack on his rider, or was he straying in the bush, or had the convicts carried him off?",
  "24306": "How can he tell?",
  "24307": "Is it with me or for me that you are angry?",
  "24308": "Then how is it that I seem to understand them myself?",
  "24309": "What am I to DO with this?",
  "24310": "Where dwell we now?",
  "24311": "Why are they always anxious?",
  "24312": "What man has authority over himself?",
  "24313": "Who attends to them?",
  "24314": "And now, monseigneur, your answer to this proposition?",
  "24315": "And that caused his sister to refuse my brother?",
  "24316": "Didn't your grandmother ever write you?",
  "24317": "And you think she would be angry?",
  "24318": "What news have you?",
  "24319": "And have you not seen any of our other friends?",
  "24320": "All I'd done?",
  "24321": "If there are other causes of poverty than competition, does that prevent it from contributing its share?",
  "24322": "Why should I deceive you?",
  "24323": "What is it you fear?",
  "24324": "Faithful to whom?",
  "24325": "Ah, but if you got nothing to eat for ever so long?",
  "24326": "A horror?",
  "24327": "Do you think I was sorry?",
  "24328": "What's the matter?",
  "24329": "What about the chair?",
  "24330": "I suppose you will live with her now?",
  "24331": "Of what consequence is it to me, then, whether he be grateful or not?",
  "24332": "And why should the goblins mind you, pray?",
  "24333": "What villainy is this?",
  "24334": "Blewett?",
  "24335": "At home?",
  "24336": "Why, instead of transports that should have intoxicated me with their deliciousness, did I experience only fears and repugnance?",
  "24337": "Whats he?",
  "24338": "Well, he took that icon home with him for a few days and what did he do?",
  "24339": "Why, we must ask, do you trouble yourself so much about death?",
  "24340": "How does your lady, and how thrives your love?",
  "24341": "The greatest affection of which he is capable?",
  "24342": "Wife?",
  "24343": "A pox, is this your inns o' court breeding, not to know your friends and your relations, your elders, and your betters?",
  "24344": "For whence should it be derived?",
  "24345": "Why don't you speak to her?",
  "24346": "And what's her name?",
  "24347": "What are those we know?",
  "24348": "Now do you want me to tell you who you are?",
  "24349": "Are you dissatisfied with my service, say?",
  "24350": "What is the object of slaying the spirit of vegetation at any time and above all in spring, when his services are most wanted?",
  "24351": "What is there in your son's face?",
  "24352": "Gone where?",
  "24353": "What length of course do you propose, dear heart?",
  "24354": "Isn't the house shut up, too?",
  "24355": "Isn't she here?",
  "24356": "In what manner was I protected by him?",
  "24357": "What do you like best?",
  "24358": "Harder on the back, this, than frum the dory, ain't it?",
  "24359": "Is it customary, I ask you, to help to tenderloin with one's fingers?",
  "24360": "Do you imagine that a person can die like this?",
  "24361": "Have you received the orders, and will you act upon them?",
  "24362": "How are they called who follow others in spite of them?",
  "24363": "Do you mean that you saw the murder?",
  "24364": "So I ask you if ye were her friends?",
  "24365": "Was it not then a man like you and me, who first proposed this law, and by speaking persuaded the ancients?",
  "24366": "A political one, I suppose?",
  "24367": "But is there anything impossible for my d'Artagnan, the noble and loyal gentleman?",
  "24368": "What, I ask, in that case, would have been your conduct towards her?",
  "24369": "Do I turn to the right, or to the left hand?",
  "24370": "And suppose he falls?",
  "24371": "An expedition, sir?",
  "24372": "Is it not enough to set him thinking about it?",
  "24373": "What am I?",
  "24374": "An' did ye not marry a nagur?",
  "24375": "Do you believe they're his own?",
  "24376": "But you're not making a mistake?",
  "24377": "Was you a party in anything, ma'am?",
  "24378": "The knight they went to?",
  "24379": "Ask him what?",
  "24380": "Won't that make it all right?",
  "24381": "Have I done something for the general interest?",
  "24382": "Have they legs and chops?",
  "24383": "What do you mean by this conduct?",
  "24384": "You're not a skater, I suppose?",
  "24385": "With him, aunt?",
  "24386": "Why does he not come to me?",
  "24387": "Among all the unfathomable precipices which surrounded him, which was his choice?",
  "24388": "Isn't it an extraordinary thing?",
  "24389": "Mais, monsieur, is it not time to begin to take more counsel of humanity, and less of your courage?",
  "24390": "Don't you see that flock of big birds making for us?",
  "24391": "How shall I requite you?",
  "24392": "Or when he chew'd it?",
  "24393": "How do I know, my dear, what young men do?",
  "24394": "How can I regret when what I did was inevitable?",
  "24395": "And, after all, why shouldn't we believe that?",
  "24396": "Can you have the heart to do it?",
  "24397": "Was not death infinitely more lovely and noble than such a life?",
  "24398": "When shall I set out?",
  "24399": "But what is this on the chest?",
  "24400": "Where's mother?",
  "24401": "Shall we turn?",
  "24402": "And now, do you wish to attend to your letters?",
  "24403": "May it be that, in some fashion or other, you want me?",
  "24404": "Do you know that the least garrison is of twenty companies of infantry?",
  "24405": "Have these confessed?",
  "24406": "Do you suppose I've asked him for an assurance?",
  "24407": "Are you sure it was my house she was coming to?",
  "24408": "And what are those hatfuls of pence and halfpence?",
  "24409": "What does the change mean?",
  "24410": "Monsieur le comte had an enemy there, then?",
  "24411": "Didn't I explain to you?",
  "24412": "Oh, can't you understand?",
  "24413": "Where are you off to?",
  "24414": "Why should this be so?",
  "24415": "His son?",
  "24416": "Well, and what next?",
  "24417": "What, you're on his track?",
  "24418": "Do you expect them today?",
  "24419": "A parson?",
  "24420": "Now, in what sign will the sun then be?",
  "24421": "Is that the way you love your neighbor as yourself?",
  "24422": "If they hear of this, will they let it pass?",
  "24423": "But where are you going,' that you talk about bidding goodbye?",
  "24424": "So you hate each other?",
  "24425": "Do you go home to dinner?",
  "24426": "Tell me how and why am I again a prisoner?",
  "24427": "You intend to look after me, then?",
  "24428": "Is not my husband here?",
  "24429": "And is she gone?",
  "24430": "If he had been your own boy, you would have put him to it, just the same, I suppose?",
  "24431": "We asked who they were?",
  "24432": "Is there not one among them who has seen it all, and who knows it to be true?",
  "24433": "Or cold?",
  "24434": "Are you cold?",
  "24435": "What were the joy of man, what else could give him pleasure, but pretty maids and noble dames?",
  "24436": "Can you not be more definite?",
  "24437": "Who is she, or how did you get her?",
  "24438": "Tell me why you came?",
  "24439": "Or, shall we continue on our way?",
  "24440": "Do you hear the dog?",
  "24441": "Is his dog dead?",
  "24442": "With our business, how can we get away?",
  "24443": "And what is this?",
  "24444": "What will then become of me?",
  "24445": "You understand, don't you, that if she didn't do this there would be no knowing what she might do?",
  "24446": "Even in the midst of joy, may he not be permitted to be gloomy and oppressed?",
  "24447": "And what does his eminence think of this love, which is, by the bye, no secret to anybody?",
  "24448": "How do they act?",
  "24449": "Which do you like best?",
  "24450": "Have you seen the army?",
  "24451": "But what have I here said, that reflections very refined and metaphysical have little or no influence upon us?",
  "24452": "Fwhat?",
  "24453": "They grow out of our knowledge, ma'am?",
  "24454": "But could you think, because the nodding husband would not wake, that e'er the watchful lover slept?",
  "24455": "And the papers?",
  "24456": "Can you not come to me now, at once, before anything terrible happens?",
  "24457": "My card?",
  "24458": "Why, isn't it there?",
  "24459": "Well, this is strange news, isn't it?",
  "24460": "Tell me, I beseech you, what ails you?",
  "24461": "Of what race could these people be?",
  "24462": "Nevyedovsky?",
  "24463": "Where does your highness wish to go?",
  "24464": "And hasn't it now?",
  "24465": "Will not you, as well as your brother, intercede with your uncle in our behalf?",
  "24466": "Is SHE coming?",
  "24467": "Did you see her face?",
  "24468": "To love me, perhaps?",
  "24469": "In the first place, what proof have we of the fact?",
  "24470": "What are you trying to do?",
  "24471": "No right to be warden of the hospital, papa?",
  "24472": "When are we to discover them?",
  "24473": "Diamonds on the moon?",
  "24474": "What is your errand, then, with me, sir?",
  "24475": "Why is it that the dogs have failed to bark?",
  "24476": "And yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him?",
  "24477": "And do you think your power as great with the fraternity as monsieur le cure told me it was just now?",
  "24478": "And whose room is this, my dear child?",
  "24479": "And me?",
  "24480": "If that is the case, why wait till evening?",
  "24481": "What children?",
  "24482": "Won't you let me run you round in the car?",
  "24483": "Lemme go with you?",
  "24484": "Is there any other point which I can make clear?",
  "24485": "ITS DECISION WHAT is a battle?",
  "24486": "Do you mean to say it's not of importance?",
  "24487": "Must I speak again?",
  "24488": "You are not laughing?",
  "24489": "Is there any news today?",
  "24490": "Or a fairy in disguise?",
  "24491": "Bingley?",
  "24492": "Let's see it?",
  "24493": "How, got the start?",
  "24494": "Wot dye mean?",
  "24495": "You are going to leave us?",
  "24496": "Wherefore should we linger upon it now?",
  "24497": "But you'll do it?",
  "24498": "Which of my friends, my lord?",
  "24499": "Are you going for a walk?",
  "24500": "What am I going to say?",
  "24501": "What, monsieur, will you leave us so soon?",
  "24502": "You didn't find it then?",
  "24503": "It not the blood in your veins as warm as his?",
  "24504": "Why was it useless to try to win any one's favour?",
  "24505": "But in the face of all of them, whose voice appeals unto me?",
  "24506": "Imprimis, he is older than my father?",
  "24507": "What has been the result of the first war?",
  "24508": "And you have promised?",
  "24509": "Have you the money with you?",
  "24510": "So you were at the races, baron?",
  "24511": "Dolly, why have you disobeyed me?",
  "24512": "So, that's it, is it?",
  "24513": "Do?",

  "27072": "What are we to do, now?",
  "27073": "And now, where is he gone?",
  "27074": "Do you not need to mitigate the struggle for existence more sanguine than the war of weapons?",
  "27075": "When will he come back?",
  "27076": "Suppose you haven't?",
  "27077": "Is it me, yer reverence?",

  "27084": "Were you looking for us?",
  "27085": "But tell me, and tell me true, what is the meaning of all this feasting, and who are these people?",
  "27086": "Has it begun?",
  "27087": "Where are you taking me?",
  "27088": "What's all this?",
  "27089": "Shall you be present in the reception room?",
  "27090": "What was the matter?",
  "27091": "What magazine, or treasury of bliss?",

  "27108": "Then you knew her before?",
  "27109": "Have you not asked papa for money?",
  "27110": "Is there anything whimsical about me?",
  "27111": "Wouldn't it be nice if it could last?",
  "27112": "Is this ingratitude, however?",
  "27113": "For nothing?",
  "27114": "The winch, you say?",
  "27115": "Was ever a man in such a fearful fool's position?",
  "27116": "But this kind man who has done so much will, I am sure, take you right on to my house?",
  "27117": "But if no one among us is capable of governing himself, then who among us has the capacity to govern someone else?",
  "27118": "Was personal happiness the aim and object of their ambition?",

  "27126": "Getting a little beyond our depth, dear, aren't we?",
  "27127": "Now, what is competition?",
  "27128": "Why didn't you come near us all these three days, eh?",
  "27129": "Do you know that you are speaking to me quite as a friend?",
  "27130": "What do you do then?",
  "27131": "Do you think we live as cheaply as we might?",
  "27132": "You haven't opened the parcel and swallowed one or two as you come along, have you?",
  "27133": "Surely there are classified lists?",
  "27134": "Why ride into the middle of the battalion?",
  "27135": "May I ask if you can confirm these statements?",
  "27136": "Is not this an infallible and sovereign antidote?",
  "27137": "Well, what's this now?",
  "27138": "Isn't it fortunate I've got such an imagination?",
  "27139": "Now, what have we a right to possess?",
  "27140": "A cigarette?",
  "27141": "But what did he do, my dear?",
  "27142": "What act?",
  "27143": "What in thunder is it?",
  "27144": "And the man?",
  "27145": "How am I to understand you, mon pere?",
  "27146": "Why dilate upon what everybody knows?",
  "27147": "Might this be for you, sir?",

  "27155": "Shall he now be arrested in his desolating career?",
  "27156": "Do you know what that means?",
  "27157": "But why should I make a long story of it?",
  "27158": "Mightn't I stay and sleep with you tonight, grandmother?",
  "27159": "Are you not jealous at all?",
  "27160": "And is not the chief object of vanity, our bravery or learning, our wit or breeding, our eloquence or address, our taste or abilities?",
  "27161": "Jo, I hope you haven't done anything rash?",
  "27162": "And do you believe it to be so?",
  "27163": "Do you take milk in yours?",
  "27164": "What fiend is this?",
  "27165": "Where are they?",
  "27166": "Would any one believe it?",
  "27167": "What if I've accepted too passively the funny form of our life?",
  "27168": "What, indeed, can tend to deprave the character more than outward submission and inward contempt?",
  "27169": "If they bite and kick?",
  "27170": "Is there that about me that should affright a man?",
  "27171": "For how can any experience be adequate with an idea?",
  "27172": "What is this I hear about you?",
  "27173": "How old are you, dear?",
  "27174": "I wonder if they made that fearful sound I heard just before you came?",
  "27175": "What made them kick you out?",
  "27176": "Am I allowed to repeat it?",
  "27177": "I think that this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with me for six o'clock?",
  "27178": "Have you any dice in your pocket?",
  "27179": "What on earth put such a notion into your head?",

  "27185": "Would he say a lie?",
  "27186": "How much money had these men fraudulently obtained?",
  "27187": "How many have you loved?",
  "27188": "Then why, when you were able to run away, did you go back to him?",
  "27189": "And don't you think the governor ought to let me have it?",

  "27203": "Are we falling?",
  "27204": "And by character?",
  "27205": "And would not a really good education furnish the best safeguard?",
  "27206": "What manner of man are you?",
  "27207": "I think you are growing less cool, my friend, and are beginning to be a trifle surprised, aren't you?",

  "27224": "How shall we set about it?",
  "27225": "Not too difficult?",
  "27226": "Were his father's religious devotion, his teachers warnings, his own knowledge, his own search able to keep him safe?",
  "27227": "Should they be embarked?",
  "27228": "Is my experience but of yesterday?",
  "27229": "Can I trust in you?",

  "27231": "Where are you to go?",
  "27232": "Do you want to earn half a crown?",
  "27233": "Wilcox?",
  "27234": "What do I mean?",
  "27235": "But will no one remain in the house, my lord?",
  "27236": "How, then, with these variations and with revenues so uncertain, can we establish even distribution and uniform wages for laborers?",

  "27280": "What does your wife want?",
  "27281": "Couldn't you wish to be married to him yourself, if that was the case?",
  "27282": "It was his life or mine, but far more than that, it was his life or hers, for how could I leave her in the power of this madman?",
  "27283": "Then there is a truth I don't know?",
  "27284": "How did I get hold of that?",
  "27285": "Whatever is the matter?",
  "27286": "And it is true that you did not set it on fire?",
  "27287": "Has anything unpleasant happened since I saw you?",
  "27288": "Is it believed that axioms in metaphysics, declarations of right, harangues from the tribune, will put a stop to the disbanding of an army?",
  "27289": "What does not a man undergo for the sake of a cure?",
  "27290": "Shan't you?",
  "27291": "You a member here?",
  "27292": "What is your own experience of him?",
  "27293": "But aren't you mistaken in thinking that you wouldn't force him, wouldn't punish him?",
  "27294": "Me, young ladies?",
  "27295": "What are these corruptions?",
  "27296": "Doesn't he?",
  "27297": "Why must he look farther than their platform when he claims himself to stand by his platform?",
  "27298": "Now, surely, if he takes so warmly to people who are not related to him at all, may he not take as warmly to his own kin?",
  "27299": "Not since the humour of gentility was upon you, did you?",
  "27300": "Governor come round?",
  "27301": "That boy's tutor?",
  "27302": "What is a soul?",
  "27303": "And with our wives?",
  "27304": "Who would think of plotting with a poor little weak creature like me?",
  "27305": "What is his exact kin to us, mother?",
  "27306": "Is this a new brand of humour?",
  "27307": "Yes, what were we talking about?",
  "27308": "Do I know them?",
  "27309": "And what business have you here?",
  "27310": "You know who bricks and mortar is, I suppose, sir?",
  "27311": "Oh, what's the use of me saying anything?",
  "27312": "I make the first advances?",
  "27313": "Why strive for the knowledge of things if we become more cowardly thereby?",
  "27314": "Why, how do you come to be here?",
  "27315": "What the devil is he doing here?",
  "27316": "What's he to do with the lassie?",
  "27317": "Why must people kneel down to pray?",
  "27318": "Do you like him?",
  "27319": "First tell the boys, what we have decided?",
  "27320": "What is it to be?",
  "27321": "Tell us, dear, what do the creatures look like?",
  "27322": "Do you see that whale now?",
  "27323": "How is it that there are birds enough ready to replace immediately a lost mate of either sex?",
  "27324": "You admit, I hope, that I have a right to speak about what concerns the dignity of my wife's sister?",
  "27325": "Will somebody hand me anything hard and bruising to pelt at her?",
  "27326": "Is he industrious at his work and respectful to you?",
  "27327": "That's the way the song runs, isn't it?",
  "27328": "Could her face inspire passion at all now?",
  "27329": "Why ought I to know?",
  "27330": "And you are not furious?",
  "27331": "Will you let me go away?",
  "27332": "John, why don't you say something?",
  "27333": "But what shall I tell the dairyman's wife?",
  "27334": "And you don't know what they do it for?",
  "27335": "Or at some public school, perhaps?",
  "27336": "They do, do they?",
  "27337": "Is not the night mournful, sad, and melancholic?",
  "27338": "I asked them, if they were at liberty to tell me the truth of what they were to do with me?",
  "27339": "Why are you sorry, sir?",
  "27340": "What prison is he in?",
  "27341": "Shall we go on, your excellency, fine champagne?",
  "27342": "Leave our brother to come to us?",
  "27343": "Will you really not have tea?",
  "27344": "Whom do you expect to find here?",
  "27345": "Have you no other to propose?",
  "27346": "What can a writer, who professes scepticism, have in common with radical views?",
  "27347": "See that blue dory behind him?",
  "27348": "But is an education which ignores them all a liberal education?",
  "27349": "What upon?",
  "27350": "But who has told you?",
  "27351": "Where are my priwileges?",
  "27352": "Well, did she say what she was coming for?",
  "27353": "How can I ever thank you?",
  "27354": "You own the name and renounce the alias?",
  "27355": "Is he of noble family, and rich?",
  "27356": "How then are we to begin our strike to destroy him?",
  "27357": "Who is this boy?",
  "27358": "And who hit you at all?",
  "27359": "What are these men's leading principles, and about what kind of things are they busy, and for what kind of reasons do they love and honor?",
  "27360": "Thornfield?",
  "27361": "May I ask if you are very busy just now?",
  "27362": "How can it concern him to learn how the self came to be what it is, or what it will be in the distant future?",
  "27363": "You think it will?",
  "27364": "But why should I weary you with details?",
  "27365": "So you kept him after all?",
  "27366": "And the queen?",
  "27367": "That we see before our noses?",
  "27368": "Can I never tell my story in a plain, straightforward way?",
  "27369": "Can competition in labor be abolished?",
  "27370": "You cannot help us?",
  "27371": "But what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance?",
  "27372": "What was the use of his being somewhere in the neighbourhood if she had no means of knowing where she could find him?",
  "27373": "You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?",
  "27374": "You will protect me from him?",
  "27375": "Had you heard?",
  "27376": "Can you remember that?",
  "27377": "Ever live by cheating at play?",
  "27378": "Why do you permit such a surgeon to have the care of the sick, wounded, and dying soldiers?",
  "27379": "And is that why he hits her?",
  "27380": "Why, what is there to understand?",
  "27381": "Yet you have a large establishment, too, I am told?",
  "27382": "And you think that I am going to send you back to that world which must know me no more?",
  "27383": "What is done to infanticides in this country?",
  "27384": "And did you see anyone?",
  "27385": "Well, then, what makes you talk so wild?",
  "27386": "You have formed one, then?",
  "27387": "Will you please pardon my rudeness?",
  "27388": "My dear father, may I beg you to prepare your mind for what I am going to say?",
  "27389": "With what my father said just now?",
  "27390": "What did you think of that, sir?",
  "27391": "Would you like me to sit down for a minute or two?",
  "27392": "He is going with you, is he not?",
  "27393": "Of what disposition is he?",
  "27394": "What is it, then?",
  "27395": "Where did you really get them?",
  "27396": "Mark must be here, yet why doesn't he answer me?",
  "27397": "What did you expect to gain by that?",
  "27398": "What heart can hold?",
  "27399": "Had he left her there to her fate in the lonely jungle?",
  "27400": "How do you do, all of you?",
  "27401": "Do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not talk as fast, and admire what she admires as rapturously as herself?",
  "27402": "Curious?",
  "27403": "Do you intend to sit up for me?",
  "27404": "But would the man acknowledge the relation?",
  "27405": "What are you doing now?",
  "27406": "Do you suppose that if I had made such a revelation to the king, I should have been alive now?",
  "27407": "He had a passion for pictures, and why should he not be able to paint as well as anybody else?",
  "27408": "Are you the gentleman who caused the accident?",
  "27409": "And the pay?",
  "27410": "Husband?",
  "27411": "I know what everyone would say is the right thing to do, but what do you say?",
  "27412": "What difference can it make to you?",
  "27413": "How could he know what comes from a woman's wavering sympathies, what from her inborn coquetry, and what from love itself?",
  "27414": "Was he a proprietor, or only a usufructuary?",
  "27415": "Wasn't that nonsensical?",
  "27416": "You have sold all your clothes?",
  "27417": "Surely you learnt that too?",
  "27418": "WHAT is it?",
  "27419": "But at this moment who knows if we may not be frightfully crushed between the two glassy surfaces?",
  "27420": "We must take care that that affair comes off all right, must we not?",
  "27421": "Why do you shake me like that?",
  "27422": "Now really should a cock be brought into a tragic play?",
  "27423": "Is his thread spun?",
  "27424": "Have not you an intimate friend?",
  "27425": "But how, and wherewith?",
  "27426": "That was a very different account of matters, was it not?",
  "27427": "What laws mean you?",
  "27428": "And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps?",
  "27429": "And on what will you sleep?",
  "27430": "That is what comes of your gospel of love, is it?",
  "27431": "Beautiful?",
  "27432": "Didn't say nothin' 'bout my old man, s'pose?",
  "27433": "Is it really possible that perfectly innocent people are kept here?",
  "27434": "You know the road?",
  "27435": "So if I say they're gone, you'll bear me witness, will you?",
  "27436": "Why should you not mention the sum?",
  "27437": "They're quite neat and decent, aren't they?",
  "27438": "To what a devil, then, said he, serve so many paltry heaps and bundles of papers and copies which you give me?",
  "27439": "How did you get such small small legs?",
  "27440": "But why shouldn't they petition, doctor?",
  "27441": "What is that news?",
  "27442": "His nieces accompany him, no doubt?",
  "27443": "Well, but whom are you attacking?",
  "27444": "Am I fool?",
  "27445": "What should hinder it?",
  "27446": "Is this true, my pulse?",
  "27447": "Have you given in your resignation, mademoiselle?",
  "27448": "How can you make yourself so inferior to me, as to show such a bad spirit?",
  "27449": "How can that be managed?",
  "27450": "When shall we be able to fish again?",
  "27451": "And what may your purpose be, most lofty lady?",
  "27452": "And when the better part of their products are consumed by others at the play, do you assure me that their families are not in want?",
  "27453": "Do I combine?",
  "27454": "What good was there in doing that?",
  "27455": "How can you do it seriously?",
  "27456": "Read?",
  "27457": "Was I absurd?",
  "27458": "Live like this?",
  "27459": "And if I could, what comfort to me?",
  "27460": "Aglaya, may I kiss YOUR prince?",
  "27461": "You mean to ask, I said, what will be our answer?",
  "27462": "You do not mean to inherit that infamous crotchet my brother has got into his head?",
  "27463": "Not a circus?",
  "27464": "Well, what have you got in your ear?",
  "27465": "What came of it?",
  "27466": "What makes it smell so funny?",
  "27467": "Which way are you going?",
  "27468": "Sure, little woman?",
  "27469": "The boy's, then?",
  "27470": "How d'you account for the general indifference, then?",
  "27471": "Why do you delay?",
  "27472": "Proud, eh?",
  "27473": "Since no man has aught of what he leaves, what is't to leave betimes?",
  "27474": "How is he?",
  "27475": "Were there not the brilliant particles of a halo in the air about his head?",
  "27476": "I therefore turned towards him with a stern countenance, and asked, who he called fool?",
  "27477": "What should ye have in common with cats and wolves?",
  "27478": "You want me to swear?",
  "27479": "What you standing there for?",
  "27480": "Perhaps he is just as fond of suffering?",
  "27481": "What's the matter with you, old man?",
  "27482": "Married woman, I believe?",
  "27483": "Will you grant it to me?",
  "27484": "And the chin, with its dimples, as in health, might it not be hers?",
  "27485": "What will happen then?",
  "27486": "You mean that the thing is supernatural?",
  "27487": "And if I do speak to her, my lord, what then?",
  "27488": "Was it sufficient?",
  "27489": "Have you ever committed a sin?",
  "27490": "Presented to whom?",
  "27491": "Not for myself?",
  "27492": "Well, sir, will you go?",
  "27493": "Where did you go?",
  "27494": "What have we done?",
  "27495": "Do you jog hither, wagging your tails, to pant at my wine, and bepiss my barrel?",
  "27496": "What was going on in congress?",
  "27497": "Do you need a doctor?",
  "27498": "Why, oh why, have I betrayed myself?",
  "27499": "Had he any intellect, any thinking faculty, any consciousness of his own existence?",
  "27500": "Outspoken, is she?",
  "27501": "Is it honouring your husband to dishonour his business?",
  "27502": "To whom resort for relief?",
  "27503": "What must be done then?",
  "27504": "Are yours like that?",
  "27505": "And now, are you aware of one thing, monsieur?",
  "27506": "Is he on this farm?",
  "27507": "Now, did you not think so?",
  "27508": "What do men know about women's martyrdoms?",
  "27509": "What can be done?",
  "27510": "What are you going to do if you don't get work?",
  "27511": "Is the room to be got ready upstairs?",
  "27512": "Will you be silent?",
  "27513": "But how could she?",
  "27514": "Don't you all despise me for not stealing, when it would have been only justice?",
  "27515": "How shall I bring forth my wife?",
  "27516": "And the greater the interval which separates them from philosophy and reason, the more strange and illusive will be the pleasure?",
  "27517": "Does he also desire his archic man to be got up in a manner befitting royalty at a certain date?",
  "27518": "What can I do for you, my child?",
  "27519": "Well, the question is, what do you know about her?",
  "27520": "What was the chief trade in this place?",
  "27521": "Suppose that she coulde pittie me, what then?",
  "27522": "Where is the child?",
  "27523": "What will you take?",
  "27524": "But who could have foreseen such an attention as this?",
  "27525": "Do you know I have entrusted him with our secret?",
  "27526": "Your sister is dead, then?",
  "27527": "What have I done to displease you?",
  "27528": "How begot, how nourished?",
  "27529": "What was the good of playing?",
  "27530": "Would she not be marvellously fair to look upon when in happy mood, seeing that she is so fair in her displeasure?",
  "27531": "Any youngsters?",
  "27532": "Can a man who possesses the slightest common sense be so unreasonable?",
  "27533": "Have you kept him in the cellar all this time?",
  "27534": "Did either of you boys touch it?",
  "27535": "Why has HE done nothing?",
  "27536": "Arrest you, my most faithful servant?",
  "27537": "Might be a pun on my pottering about here, mightn't it?",
  "27538": "Why did she betray the two of them so terribly, in embracing the glow of the evening?",
  "27539": "Are you a missionary?",
  "27540": "And in what condition?",
  "27541": "What haven't you, love, said in your time?",
  "27542": "Did they have any repinings because of their course?",
  "27543": "You understand what I mean?",
  "27544": "And why shouldn't I?",
  "27545": "You serve the cardinal?",
  "27546": "Where is his pistol?",
  "27547": "What DOES it call itself, I wonder?",
  "27548": "Was she not very much surprised?",
  "27549": "But what is that blockhead of a benevolent gentleman doing?",
  "27550": "And how do you know my heart is innocent?",
  "27551": "Shall I leave you?",
  "27552": "So what does it matter?",
  "27553": "Or whether we should hold that cowardice makes no difference in the end, seeing that we all must share alike?",
  "27554": "Now, do you find the business good, and the investment advantageous?",
  "27555": "And I dare say you sing a little, too?",
  "27556": "Was she normal?",
  "27557": "Are their heads off?",
  "27558": "This page or this page?",
  "27559": "What kind of a man is he?",
  "27560": "Will you tell me how that came about?",
  "27561": "For how can we know all the possible cases that may arise?",
  "27562": "But now I have told you, you don't think it wrong of me, do you?",
  "27563": "And why should she expect her brother to do that which her brother's guests would decline to do?",
  "27564": "Do you know that if I were not consumptive, I would kill myself?",
  "27565": "What was there in the young girl's glance on this occasion?",
  "27566": "And then, why did he not at least answer it?",
  "27567": "But where are they, then?",
  "27568": "And then he can write back to my address, and I can smuggle the letter to you?",
  "27569": "Won what, ma'am?",
  "27570": "What dreadful thing drives her to say this, father, when it is such a pain to her?",
  "27571": "How long would the race endure if the parental instinct were wholly lacking?",
  "27572": "Don't you dance?",
  "27573": "What then, my gentle sister?",
  "27574": "Which of the two will be the first to fall?",
  "27575": "Was this the right corner to turn?",
  "27576": "What are we?",
  "27577": "Who of you have done more?",
  "27578": "Get it?",
  "27579": "Whose hand's out?",
  "27580": "Alas, do you love nothing else in me?",
  "27581": "Shall we send the watch there?",
  "27582": "Would you mind my taking 'em out and looking at 'em for a minute, to see how they are made?",
  "27583": "Would you believe it?",
  "27584": "But you were married?",
  "27585": "Jespersen?",
  "27586": "Is papa alive?",
  "27587": "How is she?",
  "27588": "What do the overhanging warehouses make of that?",
  "27589": "Mathematics?",
  "27590": "But is it so?",
  "27591": "And with whom?",
  "27592": "Don't you see, you brute, that my dog is a lurcher?",
  "27593": "What has it turned to, then?",
  "27594": "What would she say if she knew the truth?",
  "27595": "Don't you see you are the very one to bring yourself and family here?",
  "27596": "You loved your mother, then?",
  "27597": "I wonder what we both did that for?",
  "27598": "Damn you, sir, will you let me look inside that cab?",
  "27599": "Is there no voice in your mother's heart that forbids you to destroy your son's ideals?",
  "27600": "Been havin' a snooze, ole boy?",
  "27601": "Have you the tact?",
  "27602": "I could even go with you now?",
  "27603": "What shall you wear?",
  "27604": "How large is the garland?",
  "27605": "You are wrong, and what can you do better with your leisure hours?",
  "27606": "What did you do next?",
  "27607": "Well, where are you taking me, then?",
  "27608": "What was it he talked about?",
  "27609": "Will it hold water?",
  "27610": "Is this the missis?",
  "27611": "How shall the lots be drawn?",
  "27612": "Cannot make you understand WHAT?",
  "27613": "What'll they think of us?",
  "27614": "Who would have believed it?",
  "27615": "What means this woman?",
  "27616": "And turn all the people of the villages against us?",
  "27617": "What's the matter with the old man attending to him personally?",
  "27618": "Would you like supper?",
  "27619": "What do you say, monsieur?",
  "27620": "Do you want to know what it is in him?",
  "27621": "And why would you either?",
  "27622": "Will you wait here?",
  "27623": "Doctor seen them?",
  "27624": "So there's nothing?",
  "27625": "And shall we eat bread?",
  "27626": "Ankle all right, eh?",
  "27627": "But who was she?",
  "27628": "Why should there often be so great a difference in the result of a reciprocal cross between the same two species?",
  "27629": "Is there any better or equal hope in the world?",
  "27630": "But I wanted to ask you directly what you think of me, of my life?",
  "27631": "Of course, if one doesn't go to a public school those sort of schools are the next best thing, aren't they?",
  "27632": "Are you quite impervious to good advice?",
  "27633": "Captain's a great feller, ain't he?",
  "27634": "What is the matter with me?",
  "27635": "Did you see herself?",
  "27636": "Are we lovers?",
  "27637": "And how could you think o' going to the pond, and taking your sister where there was dirt?",
  "27638": "Against D'Artagnan?",
  "27639": "What lineage, what lineage?",
  "27640": "Did you post that letter yourself?",
  "27641": "But is it a kind heart?",
  "27642": "Shall we descend to the party at all?",
  "27643": "You are not playing with us?",
  "27644": "But why did it not kill my father?",
  "27645": "What other view could he have?",
  "27646": "And because you fear that it may be?",
  "27647": "Such a thing as a what?",
  "27648": "Are you trying to find out something bad about me?",
  "27649": "You lost your school and good income through her, did you not?",
  "27650": "Shall I take her to a coach?",
  "27651": "Was it his profile that was seen on the blind two nights before?",
  "27652": "When you became engaged to the young lady whom you have just mentioned, did you make a regular proposal to her family?",
  "27653": "Can tha' read?",
  "27654": "Do all astronomers admit the existence of this satellite?",
  "27655": "What were we created for?",
  "27656": "Is there any drinkable wine in your tavern?",
  "27657": "To my lady's?",
  "27658": "Society?",
  "27659": "Was he the only passenger who came on board at that untimely hour?",
  "27660": "Did you take part in the campaign?",
  "27661": "Aren't you going to take a practice then?",
  "27662": "Alone?",
  "27663": "Did you groan?",
  "27664": "Is he not a handsome man?",
  "27665": "Why pique all mortals, yet affect a name?",
  "27666": "Can you come directly?",
  "27667": "Have you never heard these respectable men, when they got home again, talking about the way in which immorality runs rampant abroad?",
  "27668": "Did I think she was alive?",
  "27669": "Won't that make a queer combination?",

  "28064": "And me?",
  "28065": "Will they bring our horses or not?",
  "28066": "And what have you done with my gaiters?",
  "28067": "Were you on duty all day yesterday?",
  "28068": "But I may come again tomorrow?",
  "28069": "The stomach?",
  "28070": "And his little girl, what am I to do with her?",
  "28071": "Have you observed how intense sound is down here?",
  "28072": "Tell yer what?",
  "28073": "How, then, did you know of it?",
  "28074": "Then why are you crying?",
  "28075": "You haven't seen any of them?",
  "28076": "What is there in her?",
  "28077": "The first time I met an example of this handwriting, I was positively astonished, and where do you think I chanced to find it?",
  "28078": "What signal?",
  "28079": "What are you thinking of?",
  "28080": "Is there one from the duchess?",
  "28081": "It was you, then, in short, who caused the two condemned persons to be hung?",
  "28082": "He has spoken?",
  "28083": "Won't you give papa and I a little of your company, lovee?",
  "28084": "Shan't I do as I like at the last?",
  "28085": "Oh really?",
  "28086": "Is he afraid of me or of his father?",
  "28087": "Why do you remain with her?",
  "28088": "'Tisn't so bad as that with me?",
  "28089": "But how did you know me?",
  "28090": "You know painters, then?",
  "28091": "Not for use?",
  "28092": "Is the prisoner at fifteen francs there?",
  "28093": "Then you no longer refuse?",
  "28094": "And who will dare to say that?",
  "28095": "Why did you not shun the occasions of sin?",
  "28096": "What have they done to you?",
  "28097": "Pray now, good father hermit, have not you here some other pastime besides fasting?",
  "28098": "In time to have it cooked for the next course?",
  "28099": "Is it some one belonging to the theater police?",
  "28100": "Do you have a spell?",
  "28101": "How is your grandfather?",

  "28112": "May I have the other few minutes another time?",
  "28113": "How do you like it?",
  "28114": "Still, with civil war just commencing, who could tell?",
  "28115": "And don't they like it now?",
  "28116": "And are not those petty, tormenting cares less hurtful than a continual brooding over the great affliction that oppresses us?",
  "28117": "And you will be satisfied with no other wages than your food?",
  "28118": "Why, whatever makes you think that?",
  "28119": "Justify it?",
  "28120": "And you do joy to see me thwacked about on the ribs?",
  "28121": "Isn't there any such island?",
  "28122": "But who was that possessor?",
  "28123": "Why then should you keep on being so angry with him?",

  "28125": "Haven't I just told you I let my regiment down?",
  "28126": "Don't you hear how cursedly it blows?",
  "28127": "Is it so bad?",
  "28128": "Is it not to feed the hungry, to aid in their deliverance by the means which faith suggests?",
  "28129": "Might they not have been lost by some of these people in one of their landings?",
  "28130": "Who's that mug?",
  "28131": "Are you doing anything tonight?",
  "28132": "What were your parents?",

  "28134": "Not at all?",
  "28135": "In how long?",
  "28136": "Shall we call this the promised land?",
  "28137": "Are you very old yourself?",
  "28138": "What did you commit by so acting?",
  "28139": "Acquitted the culprits and condemned the innocent, have you?",
  "28140": "Why didn't you tell me that at first?",
  "28141": "How then should the news alluded to have escaped me?",
  "28142": "Well, captain?",
  "28143": "Why should he be pacing his room all the time?",
  "28144": "Oh well, lend me five bob, will you?",
  "28145": "Sucking his drink?",
  "28146": "But have you no relatives?",
  "28147": "Does the comparison require much time or labor?",
  "28148": "How much did it cost you?",
  "28149": "Who are you going to tackle first?",
  "28150": "Have a drink with you?",
  "28151": "What more?",
  "28152": "Then why have you come back at ALL?",
  "28153": "Has that dog stopped shivering yet?",
  "28154": "D'ye feel brave men, brave?",
  "28155": "Can't you take leave?",
  "28156": "Under what circumstances did you see him?",
  "28157": "Did master sleep well?",
  "28158": "Did they come ashore here?",
  "28159": "And from what?",
  "28160": "But do you know who that lady is you talk about in such a fashion?",
  "28161": "But what is the matter, my boy?",
  "28162": "And you fancy he will not put his maxim into execution, now that he has got hold of the king?",
  "28163": "A dog has got under my bed?",
  "28164": "And where is the governor?",
  "28165": "His sister worked also but what could she do with seven little children?",
  "28166": "That can't be wrong, can it?",
  "28167": "Save me from death?",
  "28168": "My brother?",
  "28169": "Or, did he stop after the last hecatomb?",
  "28170": "Don't you think I deserve another kiss, then?",
  "28171": "Was she, or is she, mad, or what sort of horrible danger is it?",
  "28172": "What is there about me to make a wonderful girl love me?",
  "28173": "Had he not been supremely successful?",
  "28174": "Who stopped him?",
  "28175": "Can't you fancy the conclusions he'll draw?",
  "28176": "And what say you to that?",
  "28177": "Why don't you pad?",
  "28178": "Then, where are you now?",
  "28179": "You wouldn't think we'd keep you over time, now, would you?",
  "28180": "Am I to call in any assistance, or is the trick done?",
  "28181": "Why can't you be rational?",
  "28182": "And half of what you had was hers?",
  "28183": "What must they think as they see us sailing in the air?",
  "28184": "Now, will you come upstairs?",
  "28185": "A lump of wax?",
  "28186": "Do you know what it means?",
  "28187": "Is anything the matter, sir?",
  "28188": "Do you think you'll be able to get through?",
  "28189": "Is there no guarantee for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness?",
  "28190": "Then why DO you wait?",
  "28191": "Do you think he is hopeful?",
  "28192": "What will be the conclusion?",
  "28193": "And with you, ma'am?",
  "28194": "Just thinking what?",
  "28195": "You know the contents of this letter, no doubt?",
  "28196": "What do you wonder at?",
  "28197": "Who made these dissimilarities?",
  "28198": "A miser?",
  "28199": "Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the hangman who would gain his fee?",
  "28200": "You know what I mean?",
  "28201": "Can you read it?",
  "28202": "What med you be up to?",
  "28203": "D'you reckon he knowed anything?",
  "28204": "Suppose we sell off all the horses, and sell one of your farms, and pay up square?",
  "28205": "What if he should be no gentleman now, but a clown indeed, lady?",
  "28206": "Who, his parents?",
  "28207": "May I go with you?",
  "28208": "Do you see it?",
  "28209": "Where can you begin?",
  "28210": "Will your eminence please read and examine?",
  "28211": "Why, how in the nation did they ever git into such a scrape?",
  "28212": "Where did the shipwreck occur?",
  "28213": "Did one ever hear of such a thing?",
  "28214": "Is anything the matter?",
  "28215": "What you demand of me is serious, then?",
  "28216": "What then, in the name of heaven, could you go to war for?",
  "28217": "Surely there is no danger of anything so dreadful?",
  "28218": "What must one day come and may not pass by?",
  "28219": "Well, madame?",
  "28220": "Have you got the cartridges?",
  "28221": "To go with you for?",
  "28222": "Don't you think that is extraordinarily generous?",
  "28223": "Is there no debt to pay, no boon to grant?",
  "28224": "You don't expect anybody to believe this, about the lady and the sovereign, do you?",
  "28225": "Then, perhaps, you cannot tell me what sort of a woman she is?",
  "28226": "Ye are frightened?",
  "28227": "But how in the world did you know that he was in the house at all?",
  "28228": "May I venture to congratulate you?",
  "28229": "A successor?",
  "28230": "Shall not we two lie on the bridal bed this same night?",
  "28231": "Did all enjoy it?",
  "28232": "Don't you use a study?",
  "28233": "Isn't it damp?",
  "28234": "How was it wrought to such perfection?",
  "28235": "Am I likely to be frozen?",
  "28236": "A presentation?",
  "28237": "Does he wish it?",
  "28238": "Why did you?",
  "28239": "The decline of his fortunes, then?",
  "28240": "What was the cause of such degeneration?",
  "28241": "They are coming, then?",
  "28242": "How can you talk about shame, papa?",
  "28243": "Who is to throw a stone?",
  "28244": "How so, my pet?",
  "28245": "Ambulance or train?",
  "28246": "Dare I ask you to explain?",
  "28247": "Only what are we to talk about?",
  "28248": "Again, if there be nothing real in the universe, what is it that causes unreal objects to appear?",
  "28249": "What do you want of me?",
  "28250": "Not the old business?",
  "28251": "Somebody was coming?",
  "28252": "Mad one, what have I said?",
  "28253": "Do you know I am dissatisfied with your younger son?",
  "28254": "In pain, where?",
  "28255": "Doth it long for knowledge as the lion for his food?",
  "28256": "But what other ways?",
  "28257": "So I come and take, and what do I do?",
  "28258": "But why have you no packing bag?",
  "28259": "He does your bidding?",
  "28260": "Had he not better take the big umbrella?",
  "28261": "But of what?",
  "28262": "Shall you be there, sir?",
  "28263": "You didn't know him, did you?",
  "28264": "Mamma, are you asleep?",
  "28265": "Have I not, sir?",
  "28266": "And so many children poor?",
  "28267": "At least, what?",
  "28268": "Are not the roofs and the lintels wet?",
  "28269": "At what time did he go?",
  "28270": "Perfectly plain, isn't it?",
  "28271": "Then how could they tear me pitilessly from all that was dear to me, and lock me up in prison like a wild animal?",
  "28272": "And who's to make him?",
  "28273": "How did the boat strike when she went in?",
  "28274": "How hight she?",
  "28275": "You understand what I mean?",
  "28276": "But is not war an art?",
  "28277": "Postponed?",
  "28278": "She is, is she?",
  "28279": "Who is fit for it?",
  "28280": "Do you not as a rule think women below your notice as companions?",
  "28281": "Will you tell me where the BRITANNIA was wrecked?",
  "28282": "What chance had they against one who, if she had a mind, could put by out of her income twice as much as they, poor women, could spend?",
  "28283": "What mede is aye to live in comfort?",
  "28284": "Who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads?",
  "28285": "Who's over me?",
  "28286": "Why, in the devil's name, have they served me thus?",
  "28287": "You know her husband, of course?",
  "28288": "Is it possible that the meaning of life was not disclosed to him before he died?",
  "28289": "Are you brutes?",
  "28290": "Think it'll ride?",
  "28291": "What'll the other people in the house say to my being here?",
  "28292": "But was it all there was of life?",
  "28293": "What private box?",
  "28294": "Nor written?",
  "28295": "Would I not give all that I have of strength at one blow if I could open his eyes to see as I see but for one minute?",
  "28296": "Consequently, a capital blade?",
  "28297": "And break it out?",
  "28298": "He has the horse, then?",
  "28299": "You're not sorry you've come, are you?",
  "28300": "The entrance cannot be easy?",
  "28301": "Why do I not give it?",
  "28302": "And does that hinder you from letting me know the second reason?",
  "28303": "Clarence?",
  "28304": "Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy?",
  "28305": "Why did you play us such a trick, damn you?",
  "28306": "What is his object?",
  "28307": "What would happen next?",
  "28308": "Who might do this but the women?",
  "28309": "Why don't you scream?",
  "28310": "Do you know that?",
  "28311": "Why, my dear friend, do I not see you?",
  "28312": "But, in truth, what is the good of these disguises?",
  "28313": "Will that restore it to sight?",
  "28314": "Where is this person?",
  "28315": "What can a man spend his ha'pence on here in this country hole?",
  "28316": "Catharine, did I do wrong?",
  "28317": "How much are you out of pocket?",
  "28318": "What has become of her?",
  "28319": "Could we advertise, then, asking for information from wharfingers?",
  "28320": "Does this infinite awaken in us the idea of essence, while we can attribute to ourselves only the idea of existence?",
  "28321": "We will say ten o'clock then?",
  "28322": "To its honors, to its flowers, to its golden aspirations?",
  "28323": "But always smelling those leather books, what can be expected?",
  "28324": "Is it not time for a change?",
  "28325": "What did happen to me?",
  "28326": "Do you think now that I shall tell you what motive he had had in starting out?",
  "28327": "You perhaps think I should have expected this refusal?",
  "28328": "And your cargo?",
  "28329": "You do like me a bit, don't you?",
  "28330": "Who was killed in another place?",
  "28331": "What's the game?",
  "28332": "Not related to her, sir?",
  "28333": "But, they say, is that true right, social right, fraternal right?",
  "28334": "Do you know, sir, that that man did all this?",
  "28335": "Did he give you anything else?",
  "28336": "Why should he die, for he felt that he could not live, under such a weight of obloquy?",
  "28337": "It's he then who has told you?",
  "28338": "Is that all?",
  "28339": "Took?",
  "28340": "How much do you know?",
  "28341": "Out of your own pocket?",
  "28342": "Why was it none would give it, then?",
  "28343": "Shall they be banished from the district, or from the whole land?",
  "28344": "Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?",
  "28345": "Did I abuse you?",
  "28346": "And who wants to be acquainted with you?",
  "28347": "What can you do?",
  "28348": "Are you in love with the cows?",
  "28349": "Not to her uncle?",
  "28350": "Why should it not, at a certain depth, attain an impassable limit, instead of rising to such a point as to fuse the most infusible metals?",
  "28351": "But why have you done it at all?",
  "28352": "Haven't you noticed it?",
  "28353": "And what does this groom do?",
  "28354": "Sun in your eyes and his face in the shadow?",
  "28355": "Would she hear of his being slapped and beat by drummers demnebly?",
  "28356": "Who did all that mischief?",
  "28357": "Ain't we gotta live?",
  "28358": "Are we at the pole?",
  "28359": "Do you hear, do you hear what he says?",
  "28360": "Don't you think you could find some work to do?",
  "28361": "Was he again to be disturbed?",
  "28362": "Was she going to act and keep house?",
  "28363": "But why does he have this idea of a horse?",
  "28364": "Was that his work or was it possibly the doing of someone who was bent upon counteracting his schemes?",
  "28365": "Two minutes wrong?",
  "28366": "Do you not guess, monsieur?",
  "28367": "Where's your horse?",
  "28368": "Will you give me something to eat and a bed?",
  "28369": "What would they do to assist them?",
  "28370": "Let us have the land?",
  "28371": "Does he ever pay the rent for you?",
  "28372": "Might I ask you, sir, to pacify my mind?",
  "28373": "It is difficult to rise above the jungle standards and reason by the light of civilized ways, is it not, my friend?",
  "28374": "What about your government and all this treatment?",
  "28375": "What the devil are you doing?",
  "28376": "What help is to be hoped for, what consolation, what solace?",
  "28377": "Or, may we not owe their visit to the dead colt?",
  "28378": "Where shall we search for him?",
  "28379": "Why should you keep such things from me?",
  "28380": "Physiology not an experimental science?",
  "28381": "What about the dough?",
  "28382": "Can she have loved my brother so little as to be able to forget him so soon?",
  "28383": "It wasn't then that she told you?",
  "28384": "What thing?",
  "28385": "Do you suppose she takes you for a symbol?",
  "28386": "No worse news of master, I hope, sir?",
  "28387": "Has she run away because we are come?",
  "28388": "Shall I tell her or not?",
  "28389": "But then, why had he permitted that man to leave him alive?",
  "28390": "What's that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for?",
  "28391": "On which of these actions did he reflect with the most pleasure, when he was summoned by the angel of death?",
  "28392": "How shall I don't?",
  "28393": "What was in there?",
  "28394": "But tell me, what is she?",
  "28395": "Wouldn't you like to be king of that splendid fairyland?",
  "28396": "Is he ungrateful to no one else?",
  "28397": "Aye, how do you know he is?",
  "28398": "Does our friend eke out his modest income with a crossing?",
  "28399": "The stag spoke?",
  "28400": "What are the dangers which menace us?",
  "28401": "Monsieur does not then renounce his excursion for this evening?",
  "28402": "You imagine, I dare say, that you invented something quite new?",
  "28403": "Why shouldn't she win?",
  "28404": "Is there anything in what I say, or am I talking to no purpose?",
  "28405": "Was he already with the queen?",
  "28406": "What is the matter, that with all his ill usage of me, I cannot hate him?",
  "28407": "Now, I beseech you, do tell me, have you ever attended to their pairing and breeding?",
  "28408": "Oh, what have I done to be blessed with such friends?",
  "28409": "Two one pound notes, or friends?",
  "28410": "Can it be that the dog has not understood his master?",
  "28411": "Why indeed should they maintain a watch?",
  "28412": "What was I to do?",
  "28413": "So will you abandon your plan?",
  "28414": "What can I say that will enable you to understand the depth of my sorrow?",
  "28415": "Did she still love him?",
  "28416": "What you 'bout?",
  "28417": "And of the pleasures of love, and all other pleasures, the same holds good?",
  "28418": "What does she want?",
  "28419": "You needn't go yet, need you?",
  "28420": "Will it be safe to leave you there alone?",
  "28421": "How many things she knows, doesn't she?",
  "28422": "In your room?",
  "28423": "Then you won't forgive me?",
  "28424": "Can dignity of mind exist with such trivial cares?",
  "28425": "Ah, friends, do ye divine also my heart's double will?",
  "28426": "Who was th' lad what carried th' flag?",
  "28427": "Are they dead, ma'am?",
  "28428": "And what shall we have in lieu of it?",
  "28429": "It is a lovely night, and why should we not prolong our ride a little?",
  "28430": "Will she then have sufficient native energy to look into herself for comfort, and cultivate her dormant faculties?",
  "28431": "You will not come?",
  "28432": "For arrears of pay?",
  "28433": "Copperfield, my dear fellow, how do you do?",
  "28434": "And is the city which is under a tyrant rich or poor?",
  "28435": "Was it not too clear that, let the matter go how it would, there was no happiness in store for her?",
  "28436": "Would you kindly send one of your constables for two buckets of water?",
  "28437": "But what is there, then, above the sun?",
  "28438": "How is it you don't know?",
  "28439": "Why are they not given up to the church, as they ought to be?",
  "28440": "But you, d'Artagnan, what is the matter with you, and what has happened to you personally?",
  "28441": "To conceal his name?",
  "28442": "Is it at some set season?",
  "28443": "Did she know anything of his life upon the sea?",
  "28444": "Where is so awful a responsibility laid upon them?",
  "28445": "Well, my boy, what's there to prevent you?",
  "28446": "What more natural, after this, than the dream which came to him?",
  "28447": "If vices be genuine and virtue a deception, as you think, why do you call the inventors of that deceiving art sages?",
  "28448": "Has the law any eyes to witness your grief?",
  "28449": "How can I be vain when I know I'm homely?",
  "28450": "The little girl?",
  "28451": "Kicked on that occasion for cheating at dice?",
  "28452": "What proofs do you require?",
  "28453": "On business, eh?",
  "28454": "Why, what's happened?",
  "28455": "Not hurt you, did I?",
  "28456": "Was it the time the sandy cat walked round the balustrade?",
  "28457": "What insults, girl?",
  "28458": "And how does any one know whether he will stay days, months, or years?",
  "28459": "Well, how are you going to get out of that?",
  "28460": "Have you your stethoscope?",
  "28461": "Well, where can we find it?",
  "28462": "Was it mere social effect, fulfilment of ambition in the social world, in the community of mankind?",
  "28463": "How about this ad of yours?",
  "28464": "Do you still suppose that I am a boy ignorant of my own mind, and mistaking the impulses of my own soul?",
  "28465": "Must we then not be married, in order to sanctify the union of our hearts?",
  "28466": "Ay, but will you promise to come?",
  "28467": "What did you write about?",
  "28468": "Perhaps you are laughing again?",
  "28469": "So you think that these people have already quitted the island?",
  "28470": "What's a lad with good friends doing as loblolly boy?",
  "28471": "Who can tell if that mind, when the touchstone is applied to it, will not be found of a mean and vulgar character?",
  "28472": "But what time's breakfast, sir?",
  "28473": "Did you signal us, lording?",
  "28474": "Where was you raised?",
  "28475": "May I read it?",
  "28476": "Where is the treasure?",
  "28477": "You know?",
  "28478": "Snatch at it?",
  "28479": "Well, what say you to a friend that would take this bitter bargain off your hands?",
  "28480": "Just step into this corner a moment, will you?",
  "28481": "What will you do, dear?",
  "28482": "Who shall prevent him?",
  "28483": "Is it a profession?",
  "28484": "You admit you owe him three pounds then for a month's board?",
  "28485": "Have I not found her friendless, and cold, and comfortless?",
  "28486": "Is he learned?",
  "28487": "Ay, where are they?",
  "28488": "Who is there?",
  "28489": "Why should he feel joy at turning back?",
  "28490": "Must I really?",

  "28492": "Thy work, the KARMA?",
  "28493": "It's queer, isn't it?",
  "28494": "Was I not a fool, when I refused to look at or speak to him?",
  "28495": "And may we say that this has been proven?",
  "28496": "Does she cook the dinner?",
  "28497": "How do you come to know it?",
  "28498": "She was confined at your house, was she not?",
  "28499": "Then why didn't you come to me to wipe them for you?",
  "28500": "Do you know who I am?",

  "28510": "Why one to come and one to go?",
  "28511": "Is not that the bishop?",
  "28512": "Why will you ruin yourself, your family, and nation?",
  "28513": "Why such a hard sentence?",

  "28515": "May I go and see her?",
  "28516": "Where did you go this morning?",
  "28517": "So very soon?",
  "28518": "Well, sir, in writing against property, have I done more than quote the language of history?",
  "28519": "I unhappy?",
  "28520": "But do I see a handkerchief?",
  "28521": "But how did he come by his death?",
  "28522": "Can you believe it?",
  "28523": "But if you have big ideas you have to use big words to express them, haven't you?",
  "28524": "Do you think that was done last night?",
  "28525": "Which is the way to the chapel?",
  "28526": "May we, then, be permitted to speak of the past in the present?",
  "28527": "What victim?",
  "28528": "Do we not own the country?",
  "28529": "Raoul, did you ever see anybody hung?",
  "28530": "May I be permitted a word or two of advice?",
  "28531": "If not, where's he gone?",
  "28532": "What would they think of me?",
  "28533": "What says the abbe?",
  "28534": "Might it not be that she would calculate that an interview would thus be possible?",
  "28535": "Why linger to add to the number of the victims of our merciless enemies?",
  "28536": "What is bad?",
  "28537": "And what now?",
  "28538": "Was he actually in hiding from the police?",
  "28539": "Shall he in the meantime risk the character and interest of the nation in the hands of men to whom he can not give his confidence?",
  "28540": "What's the meaning of this?",
  "28541": "In the first place, what is the gentleman's name?",
  "28542": "Don't you want to go out, and walk around the moon, and pick up diamonds?",
  "28543": "But how was it possible to effect this?",
  "28544": "Will you let me?",
  "28545": "And look you, lord, times are not ill, so wherefore should I risk a change of days?",
  "28546": "That certainly seems a satisfactory explanation, does it not?",
  "28547": "Why, I suppose you'll make a dive for a hatful of diamonds, won't you?",
  "28548": "You have my birth certificate?",
  "28549": "Isn't this mattress hard enough, and the room dull enough, and pain bad enough, but THEY must torture me?",
  "28550": "Is it an odd speech, papa?",
  "28551": "Why don't we go in with them?",
  "28552": "Had you not observed it before?",
  "28553": "Then why didn't I sneeze?",
  "28554": "Who would attend him when he was sick?",
  "28555": "Till to your very doors the war be brought?",
  "28556": "A sleeping draught?",
  "28557": "Philip?",
  "28558": "But they may come any moment, for you left word that I awaited them?",
  "28559": "Why, indeed?",
  "28560": "Shall you?",
  "28561": "But how came the hand to discompose you so much, if it was only a letter of business?",
  "28562": "Why did this sudden conviction of a religious woman cast a terrible doubt in my mind?",
  "28563": "Was that then he or an inhuman thing moved by a lower soul?",
  "28564": "And the power which the eye possesses is a sort of effluence which is dispensed from the sun?",
  "28565": "What was one to think or feel?",
  "28566": "Can you tell the position of the rooms?",
  "28567": "To defend ourselves against attack?",
  "28568": "The child?",
  "28569": "You will marry me, won't you?",
  "28570": "When shall I have the answer, monseigneur?",
  "28571": "But where does it stay?",
  "28572": "D'you like that?",
  "28573": "You know that to be so?",
  "28574": "Was it possible to render any aid to the dying man?",
  "28575": "Widowed mother, perhaps?",
  "28576": "Has she mentioned me lately?",
  "28577": "And what your sorrow?",
  "28578": "Did you speak, my own?",
  "28579": "Is it only a voice?",
  "28580": "Why wonder about this?",
  "28581": "Did he not advertise?",
  "28582": "In what manner?",
  "28583": "What would they do if they found me?",
  "28584": "But how can I pay them?",
  "28585": "How was this done?",
  "28586": "Away from me?",
  "28587": "And, if so, surely there is good material in you?",
  "28588": "It was he did that, and amn't I a great wonder to think I've traced him ten days with that rent in my crown?",
  "28589": "What was the matter with you, baron?",
  "28590": "May I have the honour?",
  "28591": "Will you come into the garden?",
  "28592": "Will it satisfy them, in the future, if we have nothing to do with invasions and insurrections?",
  "28593": "But what are we to do with her when we have caught her?",
  "28594": "And what do you say of lovers of wine?",
  "28595": "Where now the splendid future of her poor duped children?",
  "28596": "So that is what you wanted the money for?",
  "28597": "Would you like to take her place?",
  "28598": "Was it in the papers yet?",
  "28599": "Who lives to the left there?",
  "28600": "Where shall we have tea?",
  "28601": "Would she ever die?",
  "28602": "And had the leather interior lasted with the felt cap through seven centuries?",
  "28603": "But why should anyone take it in order to keep it in his house?",
  "28604": "What will happen now?",
  "28605": "Next, how can the posting be accomplished in these mountainous parts?",
  "28606": "Does your soul belong to him now?",
  "28607": "How is man to know?",
  "28608": "And what can I do for you, esteemed prince?",
  "28609": "But this letter in which he recommends you to me?",
  "28610": "What are bulbs?",
  "28611": "Would you like to ferry me over?",
  "28612": "I hope your respected father is well, sir?",
  "28613": "And what, my lord, has been my fault?",
  "28614": "Then what is the illness itself?",
  "28615": "Is that what you've been so funny about this evening?",
  "28616": "But you are half asleep, are you not?",
  "28617": "Of whom?",
  "28618": "And suppose I were to die?",
  "28619": "I wonder where they do go, by the by?",
  "28620": "Is the well where you got this water near at hand?",
  "28621": "And does your honor know the four men who undertook to rescue him?",
  "28622": "Did you still hear the knocking?",
  "28623": "But to what place was I to go?",
  "28624": "Would you work for four and a half a week?",
  "28625": "You have a child?",
  "28626": "Doesn't the name of the country strike you even in the mere mention of it?",
  "28627": "How shall we punish him for such a speech?",
  "28628": "What can be plainer than that the webbed feet of ducks and geese are formed for swimming?",
  "28629": "The sun?",
  "28630": "Diana?",
  "28631": "But who was she?",
  "28632": "Have you been in others?",
  "28633": "How died he?",
  "28634": "She asked, if she should call me again?",
  "28635": "You won't mind, will you?",
  "28636": "Have you been there long?",
  "28637": "Do I interrupt?",
  "28638": "But it is quite understood, is it not?",
  "28639": "Will you carry him?",
  "28640": "Neither will he ever break faith where there have been oaths or agreements?",
  "28641": "If he comes back again, father?",
  "28642": "But who can tell what had happened?",
  "28643": "What then, I shall be asked, prevents these things from taking place with such regularity and precision?",
  "28644": "Who is the lady?",
  "28645": "Ain't it good enough to be in your book?",
  "28646": "And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?",
  "28647": "Is it not a just retribution?",
  "28648": "And where are the bodies?",
  "28649": "What do you say to coffee?",
  "28650": "Then we are friends?",
  "28651": "What are you thinking of, D'Artagnan?",
  "28652": "It was four years ago that I had it made, and what do you think I chose for the word and figures?",
  "28653": "Can I have missed it?",
  "28654": "Krajiek could 'a' put it there, couldn't he?",
  "28655": "WHICH candle?",
  "28656": "Shall we take their horses out, or tell them to find friends elsewhere as they best can?",
  "28657": "How much longer will you stay here?",
  "28658": "Is yours a hooky or a nobbly?",
  "28659": "And if he were innocent of any wrong, why did he not do something to clear himself?",
  "28660": "And it is to you, you graceless varlet, I owe all this?",
  "28661": "I have spoken of this because I keep wanting to know for a fact whether other people feel such enjoyment?",
  "28662": "Who is the fellow with him?",
  "28663": "And what will happen now?",
  "28664": "Can we be so unwise as to mean, that she shall keep a navy in our harbours for that purpose?",
  "28665": "Well, I don't think there's anything more, is there?",
  "28666": "Do you think that you are going to stay here?",
  "28667": "Are you going away, or has something happened?",
  "28668": "At the point where the path passes through the gate, you could surely pick up the tracks?",
  "28669": "What have we for lunch?",
  "28670": "Then it's a go, eh?",
  "28671": "What is't?",
  "28672": "Because she was there?",
  "28673": "Can you, of all the people who love her, bear to see her so?",
  "28674": "And if we had not arrived, what would you have done?",
  "28675": "Should you like me to take down his hat to him?",
  "28676": "Honest?",
  "28677": "Are all the flowers dead, or do some of them come again in the summer?",
  "28678": "Can one work there?",
  "28679": "Doing?",
  "28680": "I mean, will you be good to us, or do you intend to eat us?",
  "28681": "Will there be roses?",
  "28682": "Who gives you your maintenance, I pray you?",
  "28683": "What makes you pant so, my friend?",
  "28684": "Is it his fault that he is so ugly, and has so little sense?",
  "28685": "And what due or proper thing is given by cookery, and to what?",
  "28686": "Do you take me vor a shicken ?",
  "28687": "Wot good are you?",
  "28688": "What are you to do?",
  "28689": "And why do you ask that?",
  "28690": "What is it, grandmother?",
  "28691": "What's the good of stopping?",
  "28692": "Had I right, for my own benefit, to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations?",
  "28693": "Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?",
  "28694": "By whose means?",
  "28695": "How much do you own?",
  "28696": "And the lakes, cousin, what do you say of them?",
  "28697": "Why don't you go and fetch things?",
  "28698": "Is that possible?",
  "28699": "What do you mean by lagging and a lifer?",
  "28700": "Are there no honest ones?",
  "28701": "And what is THAT to me?",
  "28702": "Are you unwell today?",
  "28703": "Phips had compromised, and why not he?",
  "28704": "To the office?",
  "28705": "Why should he bear all this?",
  "28706": "Successfully, I hope?",
  "28707": "Have you not heard the astonishing intelligence regarding her surreptitious union?",
  "28708": "Yet, what have I got to do with it?",

  "28711": "Has she been stolen?",
  "28712": "Why must she do it?",
  "28713": "And by what means our news to him repeat?",
  "28714": "What in the world was the meaning of this?",
  "28715": "Is it possible that this stranger has now become everything to me?",
  "28716": "Forgive me, won't you, and let me put the poor brute out of his misery?",
  "28717": "The question arises, what disposition are we to make of our accumulating funds?",
  "28718": "Is it of any use for me to tell you again why we must try to part with the house?",
  "28719": "How comes it that you would not answer my greetings for so long?",
  "28720": "And what did the firm say?",
  "28721": "You do think I could do some good at it, if I were to try?",
  "28722": "But what is to be done, old man?",
  "28723": "As they are or as they appear?",
  "28724": "I didn't do wrong, did I?",

  "28727": "What could he do, even supposing himself strong enough to fight the battle?",
  "28728": "Can one be too much alive, too happy?",
  "28729": "Who are to be the objects of popular choice?",
  "28730": "But will not the general be too hospitable for you?",
  "28731": "And that's the lad, sir, is it?",
  "28732": "Which road?",
  "28733": "And me?",
  "28734": "Oh, so it's not time to die yet?",
  "28735": "And how is it he has got this power over you, that you promise to marry him against your will?",
  "28736": "How could the devil from hell himself escape alive?",
  "28737": "Why don't you leave him alone?",
  "28738": "And why so late returned?",
  "28739": "What about leaving that bright boy of yours on guard?",
  "28740": "Did ye ever know this?",
  "28741": "Are you content, my beloved?",
  "28742": "Ye that tell us of harmony and reconciliation, can ye restore to us the time that is past?",
  "28743": "If they had said I was niece to a piping bullfinch, what would you care?",
  "28744": "Have you served under the usurper?",
  "28745": "You would want nothing for so doing?",

  "28763": "How long have you been there?",
  "28764": "Do you wish for a name?",
  "28765": "But what, miss?",
  "28766": "And you never by any chance lose sight of him, I presume?",
  "28767": "Should we go now?",
  "28768": "How is one to vanish partly?",
  "28769": "Who was it that was eaten?",
  "28770": "Can I have another piece?",
  "28771": "Where is the use of the devil in that sentence?",
  "28772": "Whereabouts?",
  "28773": "It is awful, love, isn't it?",
  "28774": "Yet how can I let this knavish dog die and lose the money?",

  "28781": "Can you get a few men together to go there?",
  "28782": "Shall we allege a musical dispute?",
  "28783": "Is it riveted to the planks?",
  "28784": "What, then, possessed him?",
  "28785": "Have you got it?",
  "28786": "Do you believe you have still a certain amount of it to expend this evening?",
  "28787": "Won't anything make you understand that?",

  "28789": "Then why in the world not?",
  "28790": "What are they then?",
  "28791": "What can you love me for?",
  "28792": "Is he a presentable sort of a person?",
  "28793": "Why do you talk like this to THEM?",
  "28794": "But what was his name?",
  "28795": "What do you mean by gone?",
  "28796": "But why don't you want to take it?",
  "28797": "Is not it what you have often wished to do yourself?",
  "28798": "Would a boat be waiting for us with supplies and letters?",
  "28799": "What must have been his feelings?",

  "28801": "What do you want, my pretty?",
  "28802": "Supposing him to be attached to me, would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?",
  "28803": "But suppose she had run against this piece of iron?",
  "28804": "Who will be the jury?",
  "28805": "You think, then, that you can help me more efficaciously than your brothers?",
  "28806": "And do you think it's true?",
  "28807": "Shall there never be a fresh opportunity of trying the ranges of projectiles?",
  "28808": "Did he wake up?",
  "28809": "Was he nice?",
  "28810": "And now what will we do?",
  "28811": "Do you not know?",
  "28812": "And if that were the case would your honor condemn his action?",
  "28813": "And during these days what shall I do?",
  "28814": "Don't the knives hurt?",
  "28815": "Where have you come from and what is your name?",

  "28821": "One of those swabs, was he?",
  "28822": "Do you believe he can?",
  "28823": "Who has seen her?",
  "28824": "What did he mean by such a pagan idea?",
  "28825": "Was it because at that time we passed for very rich people, and you were afraid of being refused?",
  "28826": "And besides, what have I done to bring it about?",
  "28827": "Alas, what shall I wretched wight become?",
  "28828": "But suppose it's a woman?",
  "28829": "Why am I to give an account of myself?",
  "28830": "What's that you tell me?",
  "28831": "But you think she wouldn't come?",
  "28832": "What colorable reason could be assigned, in a country so situated, for such vast augmentations of the military force?",
  "28833": "Is this too little?",
  "28834": "For the last three months?",
  "28835": "What could he reply to the deposition of the gendarmes who had arrested him in the very act?",
  "28836": "Where is thy answer, culprit?",
  "28837": "You are recovering again?",
  "28838": "What are you blurting out NOW?",
  "28839": "Shall we yield to force?",
  "28840": "Come, I do not ask for the sake of questioning you, but how did you get in?",
  "28841": "What do you wish, gentlemen?",
  "28842": "What does she?",
  "28843": "What, then, is the use of your worship?",
  "28844": "Was the gate open?",
  "28845": "Shall us begin it now?",
  "28846": "A recruit, sir, I understand?",
  "28847": "Sir?",
  "28848": "Yet could a woman who had done even what she had done deserve all this?",

  "28853": "Who is coward now?",
  "28854": "Have they nothing better to do?",
  "28855": "But that's remarkably altruistic of you, isn't it?",
  "28856": "Are you feeling any better?",
  "28857": "Do you think I care more for my dress than for my little girl?",
  "28858": "What man of taste and feeling can endure rifacimenti, harmonies, abridgments, expurgated editions?",
  "28859": "Faucheux?",
  "28860": "And do you think that you would be happy with her, or she with you, after what has passed?",
  "28861": "Do you ask their pardon of me?",
  "28862": "Who can possibly have told you I had had that dream?",
  "28863": "And this is the return you make me for all the indulgences I've heaped on you?",
  "28864": "Why not raise it five more?",
  "28865": "Will you let me tell you?",
  "28866": "You allow me?",
  "28867": "A week?",
  "28868": "And yet what else was she to think?",
  "28869": "Say, was my mother rightly slain or not?",
  "28870": "But where is this devotion?",
  "28871": "Where have I got one?",
  "28872": "Does not that content you?",
  "28873": "And what is the difference?",
  "28874": "Why are you merry?",
  "28875": "If you really cannot come to me will you let me come to you?",
  "28876": "What matters it of whom he spoke?",
  "28877": "What did it matter if the message were not intended for him?",
  "28878": "Was ever a respectable gentleman in such an impasse?",
  "28879": "Peas?",
  "28880": "You won't forget how fond you are of me?",

  "28883": "What have you done now?",
  "28884": "Did you see nobody concealed while you were there?",
  "28885": "Besides what have we to do with setting the world at defiance?",
  "28886": "It looks as if you were trying to fleece me?",
  "28887": "But why suspect me before the action?",
  "28888": "And you live here?",
  "28889": "What mean you?",
  "28890": "That's good impartial evidence, ain't it?",
  "28891": "Do you think for one moment that this little haystack is enough to feed all the flocks in the whole district?",
  "28892": "What is there more astonishing in all that I have said to you than in what you have told me?",
  "28893": "You will not help me, then?",
  "28894": "Surely you have gone too far?",
  "28895": "But I don't exactly see how we can do that?",
  "28896": "Why should he do it?",
  "28897": "But don't you think she'll know all about it, just the same?",
  "28898": "What is the business you wish to see her about?",
  "28899": "Is there anything more?",
  "28900": "Would you deprive me of one of the most indispensable of my means of livelihood?",
  "28901": "Why, how is this?",
  "28902": "What have made you so down?",
  "28903": "And where may he be now?",
  "28904": "The last time that I see him?",
  "28905": "What is her secret?",
  "28906": "Isn't there some nice girl who'd read and amuse you?",
  "28907": "Have you made this trip before?",
  "28908": "Doesn't that satisfy you?",
  "28909": "I say, stranger, how are ye?",
  "28910": "Is not this so?",

  "28912": "Wherein?",
  "28913": "Where, may I ask?",
  "28914": "Who is in this world?",
  "28915": "Doesn't join in with the lads in their games, to get some sort of excitement in this lonely place?",
  "28916": "Well, I wait patiently, do I not?",
  "28917": "Shall I have a cab called?",
  "28918": "And then your negotiations will fail?",
  "28919": "It looks newer than the other things?",
  "28920": "She what?",
  "28921": "Should you like me to stay away?",
  "28922": "What had I to do with him that he should rob me of my sleep?",

  "28924": "Can there be an appearance of that which has no form?",
  "28925": "Shall we not?",
  "28926": "Where are you going, you rogue?",
  "28927": "And you are very happy?",
  "28928": "You won't have anything?",
  "28929": "Whither shall I bear my shame?",
  "28930": "What's up, then?",
  "28931": "And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth?",
  "28932": "But why these workingman's clothes?",
  "28933": "And pray what is the ether?",
  "28934": "But there was some one there?",
  "28935": "Have you already in your mind a plan wholly or partially formed?",
  "28936": "Does he gamble?",
  "28937": "And you are certain that the queen and he did not see each other?",
  "28938": "Shall I go up and see?",
  "28939": "What have they come there to do?",
  "28940": "Do you know I think them exceedingly entertaining and strange?",
  "28941": "Will you let me take your arm as far as my own door?",
  "28942": "How's your wound?",
  "28943": "Did you not say that the dog's name was Z?",
  "28944": "Of what use are these dangerous visits, since we can't recognize him?",
  "28945": "You are the officer on duty, lieutenant of the musketeers, are you?",
  "28946": "Who said anything about killing?",
  "28947": "For the emperor's return?",
  "28948": "Can't you see you've made a mistake?",
  "28949": "Can we safely base our action upon any such vague inference?",
  "28950": "Did tha' do anythin' extra to make thysel' so strong?",
  "28951": "Or do ye go in bare bones, as I may say?",
  "28952": "Now, what is the evidence presented to this body by one of its committees?",
  "28953": "Liza, do you despise me?",
  "28954": "Come, are you ready?",
  "28955": "Has she ever had any experience?",
  "28956": "What does he want, then?",
  "28957": "And why should it be set aside?",
  "28958": "You see?",
  "28959": "Is not that the empress with him there?",
  "28960": "We only want to find out whether it is yes or no, don't we?",
  "28961": "For everything?",
  "28962": "Is it in anger or in spite that you wish to go?",
  "28963": "Paid everybody?",
  "28964": "Will the greedy gullet of the penitentiary be satisfied with swallowing him instead of all of them, if they should venture to obey him?",
  "28965": "You will come and see me again before you go, chevalier?",
  "28966": "Why should you say such desperate things?",
  "28967": "You must promise me you'll tell no one else?",
  "28968": "It isn't putting you out or upsetting your plans, I hope, or anything on those lines?",
  "28969": "What's that?",
  "28970": "Not here?",
  "28971": "Birdsburg?",
  "28972": "The count, then, is in the chateau?",
  "28973": "What did you go to the bandstand for?",
  "28974": "But what do you mean by living only for yourself?",
  "28975": "Why, know you not?",
  "28976": "Don't you love me?",
  "28977": "But may I not see my poor child?",
  "28978": "Gone down again?",
  "28979": "Whither are you going?",
  "28980": "How is that letter signed?",
  "28981": "I know you'll excuse the precautions of affection, won't you?",
  "28982": "After all, what's the odds between me and you?",
  "28983": "What rule of political morals trampled under foot?",
  "28984": "Does he play?",
  "28985": "Steerforth?",
  "28986": "Can I help loving him?",
  "28987": "And where was it?",
  "28988": "What will they leave him?",
  "28989": "How can I cross the desert?",
  "28990": "How did you get the idea?",
  "28991": "You were going to drink my wine?",
  "28992": "What's 'cordeon?",
  "28993": "Will you let me?",
  "28994": "Meet?",
  "28995": "Where are you going to next?",
  "28996": "Would it not be so, mother, if we were to meet him in fact?",
  "28997": "Are you going to walk with me a little way?",
  "28998": "Will she find an excuse for the neglect of the knight in the duty of a soldier?",
  "28999": "Why should he shun it?",
  "29000": "Who is safe, if she be convicted of crime?",
  "29001": "Or who so safe from injury as the brother of the great?",
  "29002": "But where did you gather your wisdom?",
  "29003": "What's become of him?",
  "29004": "Do you guarantee it?",
  "29005": "When shall I have done weeping?",
  "29006": "And will she go about in a plain shawl, and a large straw bonnet, carrying tracts and bone soup to her husband's poor parishioners?",
  "29007": "How's the cream of clerkship, eh?",
  "29008": "Can't you wait until dark?",
  "29009": "But what the devil are you hurrying about?",
  "29010": "Are you afraid?",
  "29011": "Why impossible?",
  "29012": "Ah, indeed, vicomte?",
  "29013": "Did she own to herself how different the real man was from that superb young hero whom she had worshipped?",
  "29014": "Has papa gone to bed?",

  "29019": "Did he catch sight of himself, therefore much despised by his late political associates?",
  "29020": "Do you mean especially this kind?",
  "29021": "I presume you grew weary of the amusement and dropped it, didn't you?",
  "29022": "And what shall it be to drink?",
  "29023": "How long th' assaults of grief and woes abide?",
  "29024": "Had they run away?",
  "29025": "Not even that?",
  "29026": "What have you been thinking of all this time?",
  "29027": "Have you had it sent where we are to go for it?",
  "29028": "Church?",
  "29029": "So soon?",
  "29030": "Did you hope to escape it because you were four times guilty?",
  "29031": "And these tablets are brought to you that you may add your prayers to those of the faithful, are they?",
  "29032": "Will you bet?",
  "29033": "And you intend to ask him?",
  "29034": "Have you got the entree?",
  "29035": "And what are these masons?",
  "29036": "What may you call his nose, now, my dear?",
  "29037": "What was it you told me?",
  "29038": "Was it you who asked him to drink some of it?",
  "29039": "What about this umbrella?",
  "29040": "But why, silence?",
  "29041": "Scott?",
  "29042": "Who has it?",
  "29043": "Do you think me an utter fool?",
  "29044": "You remember what a beautiful night it was?",
  "29045": "In life?",
  "29046": "Not as a waiter?",
  "29047": "How did you proceed?",
  "29048": "Had it been all his fault?",

  "29050": "Where I put it?",
  "29051": "A'n't I a lonely, forlorn widower?",
  "29052": "What were they doing, and why did they not instantly give the alarm?",
  "29053": "What happened before?",
  "29054": "Then he studied it over and said, couldn't I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl?",
  "29055": "Why will you look at matters in so unfriendly a light?",

  "29065": "Perhaps you would prefer being alone?",
  "29066": "Where were his flatterers now?",
  "29067": "Must I move on, sir?",
  "29068": "And he deceived you, and then deserted?",

  "29099": "And that?",
  "29100": "And what shall be their education?",
  "29101": "But who are you, pray?",
  "29102": "When did he refuse you anything?",
  "29103": "You will not be so foolhardy as to keep your promise?",
  "29104": "DO I remember her?",
  "29105": "What wonder, then, that his imagination should fail to realise the changes that eight years must have worked?",
  "29106": "But you will love him, papa?",
  "29107": "Is it because the sun is declining to the horizon?",
  "29108": "Do you require my services now?",

  "29116": "Shall we bury it again?",
  "29117": "He must have bewitched her, I suppose?",
  "29118": "Why not accord to both equal property?",
  "29119": "Is he a bishop, then?",
  "29120": "Who knows?",
  "29121": "Will you not trust me so far as that?",
  "29122": "Will that be possible?",
  "29123": "McMurdo?",

  "29142": "Is it the personal and individual element in us, or the spiritual and universal?",
  "29143": "Why, where was the difficulty?",
  "29144": "Who deluded you?",
  "29145": "If the virtuous should be very few in number, how then shall we act?",
  "29146": "But to what family does it belong?",
  "29147": "You don't believe me?",

  "29255": "Writes for the stage, does he?",
  "29256": "And wherefore were you called away just now?",
  "29257": "How do you find them?",
  "29258": "Where did it come from?",
  "29259": "And do not the natures of men and women differ very much indeed?",
  "29260": "Who was not his friend who had heard him speak once?",
  "29261": "What could I say to them?",
  "29262": "Capitally, warmly said, wasn't it?",
  "29263": "Well, and then?",
  "29264": "You do not find it easy to advise me?",
  "29265": "Is that, in truth, worthy of thanks?",
  "29266": "Come and take a walk, my dear?",
  "29267": "Do you really not know?",
  "29268": "You'll be on hand tomorrow at one o'clock, won't you?",
  "29269": "Why should I risk an imprudent step?",
  "29270": "How are we to remember our valour and train our skill?",
  "29271": "Husband cross?",
  "29272": "Oh, then you know that the king has arrived?",
  "29273": "What business are you in now?",
  "29274": "But if she were really dead, what was there of terror in the idea of killing her?",
  "29275": "Why didn't you tell me before?",
  "29276": "Won't you have a drop of vodka?",
  "29277": "Is he worth his keep?",
  "29278": "Can I do you any good?",
  "29279": "There was another woman here?",
  "29280": "What made you stay away so long?",
  "29281": "Why are there no cucumber sandwiches?",
  "29282": "For, indeed, who is there alive that will not be swayed by his bias and partiality to the place of his birth?",
  "29283": "Don't I avoid the society of women?",
  "29284": "My orders have been carried out?",
  "29285": "Any success?",
  "29286": "Has your majesty forgotten that the king expects your reply and awaits it in agony?",
  "29287": "It is a wound that confines him to his bed?",
  "29288": "Is that the way to behave to chief galleys?",
  "29289": "How were these double claims to ceremonious respect happening at the same time to be managed?",
  "29290": "What is to be done?",
  "29291": "You dirty scoundrel, is this the way you leave me?",
  "29292": "Would the interior acclivities of the crater be practicable?",
  "29293": "Where is this wedding to take place, and when?",
  "29294": "Is it the physical differences of blood, color and cranial measurements?",
  "29295": "Tell me, is my father living?",
  "29296": "Why do you look so amazed?",
  "29297": "An ape or a man?",
  "29298": "My dear, am I perfectly hideous?",
  "29299": "What is it that you mean?",
  "29300": "Do you know who she was?",
  "29301": "Are these things to be proud of?",
  "29302": "Is my sash right?",
  "29303": "Why doesn't that which belongs to the wife belong to the husband too?",
  "29304": "Wine?",
  "29305": "Is he a wise man?",
  "29306": "What is the good of that?",
  "29307": "What the devil am I to write to that good old soul?",
  "29308": "Was a schooner badly found?",
  "29309": "Didn't I see him haul you about like a milkmaid?",
  "29310": "And can't we go, too?",
  "29311": "To go running after servant girls?",
  "29312": "Where are they now?",
  "29313": "Can these things be?",
  "29314": "Is it flowers you are strewing?",
  "29315": "Why don't you stay down town and go to the theatre with me?",
  "29316": "Would you call one of them virtue and the other vice?",
  "29317": "And you met no one?",
  "29318": "Didn't you notice it?",
  "29319": "Numerous?",
  "29320": "But you feel solitude an oppression?",
  "29321": "She's her brother's heir, is she not?",
  "29322": "When do we hear of women, who starting out of obscurity, boldly claim respect on account of their great abilities or daring virtues?",
  "29323": "But where is the old man?",
  "29324": "You recollect that first night, when I was so unpolite and inky?",
  "29325": "But if you will come and live with me, papa?",
  "29326": "You think there is no hope?",
  "29327": "Do you wish to go there?",
  "29328": "Are we all ready?",
  "29329": "What do you want to rush out for this way?",
  "29330": "You don't deny that?",
  "29331": "Where does this animal live, and what is the use of that plant?",
  "29332": "And a man helpin' on her up the bank?",
  "29333": "Markleham?",
  "29334": "Holyhead?",
  "29335": "I should be glad to know whether, when I have put on my green robe in spring, the trees do not afterwards do the same?",
  "29336": "Will you?",
  "29337": "Well, aren't we going to get married?",
  "29338": "Then where does the vanity come in?",
  "29339": "But what were you to do with that woman?",
  "29340": "What does that signify, so long as they favor your suit?",
  "29341": "Do you want to stay here all day?",
  "29342": "Have you a pen?",
  "29343": "What's to become of me?",
  "29344": "What is a power, but the ability or faculty of doing a thing?",
  "29345": "Is it?",
  "29346": "Now, was there ever, since men emerged from a state of utter barbarism, an age in which there were no debts?",
  "29347": "There are whalers in these quarters, then?",
  "29348": "You went out with them, of course?",
  "29349": "Do they measure the king, too?",
  "29350": "And twisted it into thread?",
  "29351": "Where was he sitting?",
  "29352": "A setback?",
  "29353": "You will call me sister, will you not?",
  "29354": "Had she heard aright?",
  "29355": "Did we reach any goals?",
  "29356": "Whither was it going?",
  "29357": "And, suppose I should wish to be married to the man that I love?",
  "29358": "Did these men arrive here voluntarily or involuntarily, by disembarking on the shore or by being wrecked?",
  "29359": "Are you going too?",
  "29360": "Did you think there was nothing but evil at the bottom of them?",
  "29361": "What would she do?",
  "29362": "This vexes you?",
  "29363": "And what do I see here, monsieur?",
  "29364": "Why should she disappoint those expectations because of the imperious demands of a very highly excited boy?",
  "29365": "Good heavens, why should I?",
  "29366": "For an augury of good or evil?",
  "29367": "What is he doing?",
  "29368": "Why on earth should you doubt them?",
  "29369": "And are we convinced that all of them are generated out of opposites?",
  "29370": "He's got a pretty strong string round your father's leg, by what I hear, eh?",
  "29371": "Please, where ARE the crabs?",
  "29372": "If we had had provisions enough for months, how could we get out of the abyss into which we were being hurled by an irresistible torrent?",
  "29373": "May I ask how old he is, ma'am?",
  "29374": "Did you ever see her?",
  "29375": "But what on earth did she mean?",
  "29376": "What besides?",
  "29377": "And why do you stand there gaping?",
  "29378": "It wouldn't show on my eyes tomorrow, would it?",
  "29379": "Contempt, my friend?",
  "29380": "What's the right way to knock?",
  "29381": "Every mornin' do?",
  "29382": "And in what did that which has taken place concern you?",
  "29383": "What could that mean?",
  "29384": "You are her father?",
  "29385": "Are your wife and children destitute of a bed to lie on, or bread to live on?",
  "29386": "What will he do?",
  "29387": "Why disgrace me before the army?",
  "29388": "You came seeking me to make to me certain proposals, but did you make them?",
  "29389": "And why were you crying so just now?",
  "29390": "Then you can't protest the cheque?",
  "29391": "And will you get him first thing in the morning?",
  "29392": "What will you do with the light?",
  "29393": "Have you come up determined not to deal?",
  "29394": "You have heard and understood what your granddaughter has been saying, sir, have you?",
  "29395": "What could they desire beyond their liberty?",
  "29396": "Edlin?",
  "29397": "What shall we do with him?",
  "29398": "Is not thy common talk found aphorisms?",
  "29399": "I should like to deal him a blow, but can I actually do it?",
  "29400": "Do you know what time your father will be back?",
  "29401": "But who, then, is this assassin, this murderer?",
  "29402": "Why did he urge me so little about the princess?",
  "29403": "What is the meaning of their eternal care and worry?",
  "29404": "Were his eyes deceiving him?",
  "29405": "Why this ridiculous mania for affirming that every thing has been said, which means that we know all about mental and moral science?",
  "29406": "And you spoke to him?",
  "29407": "What's the trouble?",
  "29408": "Give who?",
  "29409": "Anything else?",
  "29410": "Are you mad enough to leave this house?",
  "29411": "How long have you been engaged in the practice of medicine?",
  "29412": "What of it?",
  "29413": "Then it will be our duty to select, if we can, natures which are fitted for the task of guarding the city?",
  "29414": "Why not end my misery now rather than drag out a few more wretched days in this dark pit?",
  "29415": "Why did you lend an ear to the temptings of friends?",
  "29416": "What do you understand of the affair?",
  "29417": "Are we to pass the night in the king's room?",
  "29418": "Not about money, I hope?",
  "29419": "Extraordinary, did you say?",
  "29420": "Why should you interfere?",
  "29421": "She doesn't know yet?",
  "29422": "Gania, what are you standing there for?",
  "29423": "But why, of all others, choose these?",
  "29424": "Ever so little did you say, gossip?",
  "29425": "Are you in need of soothsaying?",
  "29426": "An incendiary, then?",
  "29427": "To come at call?",
  "29428": "Have I time?",
  "29429": "Do they live?",
  "29430": "And this is all?",
  "29431": "You mean that you want to go away from me?",
  "29432": "Now, my friends, can the country be saved upon that basis?",
  "29433": "What, billing so sweetly?",
  "29434": "Well, then what of it?",
  "29435": "What would my islanders say when they heard their governor was going, strolling about on the winds?",
  "29436": "And in that case there's no reason on earth why you shouldn't go back?",
  "29437": "But, guardian, may we not hope that a little experience will teach him what a false and wretched thing it is?",
  "29438": "Have you told them to bring the horse?",
  "29439": "What are we doing?",
  "29440": "Well, did you see them fly?",
  "29441": "What are you up to?",
  "29442": "And that's why you trust him, eh?",
  "29443": "And what does he think of it?",
  "29444": "What sort of an education could they have got in the country?",
  "29445": "How do you go back?",
  "29446": "How old is your sister?",
  "29447": "Who are you, sir, and by what right do you touch this gentleman's papers?",
  "29448": "Were they in the tent?",
  "29449": "Some poaching case, no doubt?",
  "29450": "What is that for?",
  "29451": "On what occasion?",
  "29452": "But were there no reasons why I should avoid you?",
  "29453": "Would it not be of some assistance, if we knew of what substance it is composed?",
  "29454": "Mustn't it be splendid to be remarkable and have compositions written about you after you're dead?",
  "29455": "Had she only been guilty of silence as to his fate?",
  "29456": "Shall I take it down for you?",
  "29457": "What about, papa?",
  "29458": "But I suppose there is no fire?",
  "29459": "Why should she talk of her own unhappiness?",
  "29460": "The whole picture ruined, isn't it so?",
  "29461": "Surely you won't have to make another for me?",
  "29462": "Where do you suppose him to be?",
  "29463": "And what means are ours, of attaining the truth?",
  "29464": "You mean?",
  "29465": "Please, sir, be this note for you?",
  "29466": "Surely I can never have seriously written such a silly motto as that?",
  "29467": "Have you made up your mind when you shall be there yourself?",
  "29468": "Need it go on?",
  "29469": "What was going on in that mind which was so young and yet already so impenetrable?",
  "29470": "Couldn't he have some spark of manhood about him?",
  "29471": "What shall become of this?",
  "29472": "But how was this to be done, when he had no revenue, often not means enough for necessary expenses?",
  "29473": "What steps have you taken?",
  "29474": "But what's the name of your chief?",
  "29475": "And now?",
  "29476": "What was that they said?",
  "29477": "Why should any one murder a man in so clumsy a fashion as by hanging him?",
  "29478": "Stands the wind in that quarter?",
  "29479": "Is it really true, what every one says, that you cut off one of the ogre's arms?",
  "29480": "Should he knock as of old?",
  "29481": "Nothing about the silver calabash he spat into?",
  "29482": "But what availeth it?",
  "29483": "Where then lay the spots of commonness?",
  "29484": "That seems strange to you, doesn't it?",
  "29485": "Who will volunteer for the job?",
  "29486": "How do we stand in point of time, constable, eh?",
  "29487": "Did I not promise?",
  "29488": "Well, who said it was?",
  "29489": "I suppose your people all do this?",
  "29490": "Did anyone send you, sir?",
  "29491": "What then do you know?",
  "29492": "But where could a dog have come from?",
  "29493": "What shall I do with this beastly tumbril?",
  "29494": "Do I excuse her for it?",
  "29495": "Who is it that compels them to borne along?",
  "29496": "Did any of you gentlemen want to have it out with ME?",
  "29497": "Am I not a madman, and therefore irresponsible?",
  "29498": "How am I afraid of myself?",
  "29499": "Where am I?",
  "29500": "Did he before?",
  "29501": "Do you want her?",
  "29502": "To what, then, do we owe these blessings?",
  "29503": "Runic?",
  "29504": "I say, shall we soon be clear?",
  "29505": "Slid, sir, what should you behold in my face, sir, that should move you, as they say, sir, to ask me, sir, if I would sell my rapier?",
  "29506": "Am I worth anything now, since you have got into such high favor?",
  "29507": "Will nothing make you understand?",
  "29508": "And are thy deeds so good?",
  "29509": "This young cavalier, who won't have me?",
  "29510": "Tell me would you rob?",
  "29511": "Ah, it's you?",
  "29512": "What more can the devil do than strangle us?",
  "29513": "Anything more?",
  "29514": "What does it matter, when you come to think of it, whether a child is yours by blood or not?",
  "29515": "I passed you on the road?",
  "29516": "And what makes you think?",
  "29517": "Is he come back, then?",
  "29518": "Is their race extinct?",
  "29519": "Why do you cast those anxious looks on each other?",
  "29520": "Finished what, may I ask?",
  "29521": "Why, they say, is he not perfect in his training?",
  "29522": "Just now, don't you find something uncomfortable, disquieting, alarming in the atmosphere of this room?",
  "29523": "Njal went on to ask, whether he had a right of action against all of them, or whether the leaders had to answer for them all in the suit?",
  "29524": "Will you swear it?",
  "29525": "Does your excellency wish for a receipt?",
  "29526": "What experiment?",
  "29527": "How can varieties of soil engender a principle of legislation and politics?",
  "29528": "What do I know about business?",
  "29529": "But what must they deserve, then, who set him to work?",
  "29530": "But why?",
  "29531": "What would you like best to do?",
  "29532": "Meditatin', eh?",
  "29533": "Next time you roust me out, you hear?",
  "29534": "But it's not serious?",
  "29535": "We knew you were going to get married, did we?",
  "29536": "Why make a long story of what took but five minutes to do?",
  "29537": "Why with disgust?",
  "29538": "What mill?",
  "29539": "What evil spirit has taken possession of your heart that you should be so wicked?",
  "29540": "Whether a profound genius, or a sure judgment?",
  "29541": "Why should you love me?",
  "29542": "Will not the landholder know and feel whatever will promote or insure the interest of landed property?",
  "29543": "Have you heard of her good fortune?",
  "29544": "These bodies serve us?",
  "29545": "Hippolyte?",
  "29546": "Tell me, do you love me?",
  "29547": "Are you angry with me?",
  "29548": "And if they were glad to have you, why should I have brought you away?",
  "29549": "Chopin's style, then, was not original?",
  "29550": "Do you desire me to go?",
  "29551": "What d'ye think the old fornicator saith?",
  "29552": "But when he comes to his box?",
  "29553": "Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?",

  "29650": "How then do service which offends his shade?",
  "29651": "Then you were not engaged to marry him?",
  "29652": "Did not you ask it for anything?",
  "29653": "Can I speak with him?",
  "29654": "And to feel not exactly dull, but sad?",
  "29655": "Was it near, was it far?",
  "29656": "Wouldn't you, ferryman, like to accept these clothes, which are a nuisance to me, from me?",
  "29657": "Isn't he?",
  "29658": "Neither, I said, can there be any question that the guardian who is to keep anything should have eyes rather than no eyes?",
  "29659": "Damn it, did you then take me along with you for your chaplain, to sing mass and shrive you?",
  "29660": "Your mother won't know, and so what's the harm?",
  "29661": "What is the liberty of the press?",
  "29662": "Would she throw away the inestimable advantage of royal protection?",
  "29663": "In whom can we trust?",
  "29664": "Then how is it that you did not go?",
  "29665": "And what reward have they?",
  "29666": "Shan't we try that?",
  "29667": "Would you care to try it?",
  "29668": "See what, sir?",
  "29669": "What else could I say when he asked me?",
  "29670": "Are you willing to carry us through the air wherever we wish to go?",
  "29671": "Suppose it was all a gigantic mistake?",
  "29672": "Why out of the question?",
  "29673": "Is your secret of enough importance to me to spare your life for it?",
  "29674": "Oh?",
  "29675": "What more can I desire?",
  "29676": "What would he say then?",
  "29677": "Where are these lamps?",
  "29678": "Who, mother?",
  "29679": "You are studying topography?",
  "29680": "What rent do you pay here?",
  "29681": "Now, do you want any more?",
  "29682": "Is there anything wrong?",
  "29683": "How could that be possible?",
  "29684": "Hadn't I better have a shave?",
  "29685": "How could angels bear the sight?",
  "29686": "You think it then possible that they really won't have returned?",
  "29687": "What's the answer?",
  "29688": "What do you mean by the proposal you made just now?",
  "29689": "I surmise you also are quits?",
  "29690": "What sort of wood is't?",
  "29691": "Can't any one make him stop?",
  "29692": "Do you consider me so?",
  "29693": "How do I know what I was before?",
  "29694": "Shall I see you again ere my departure?",
  "29695": "Am I alarmed?",
  "29696": "How long a start have they?",
  "29697": "In the second, whence comes it?",
  "29698": "What, monsieur?",
  "29699": "Didn't ye hear a word about them matters and something more, eh?",
  "29700": "Till at last he be?",
  "29701": "And what was there in a simple curl of fair hair to appall that brutal man, familiar with every form of cruelty?",
  "29702": "In love with HER?",
  "29703": "But we would agree to make him rich enough to live, I suppose?",
  "29704": "Would a tablespoon of vanilla be enough for a small layer cake?",
  "29705": "But why do I say, in this case?",
  "29706": "He will be superintendent?",
  "29707": "Your sentence of death, if any soul hears you?",
  "29708": "What embarrassment?",
  "29709": "How do you do, dear friend?",
  "29710": "Have you got the key, auntie?",
  "29711": "What's a captive?",
  "29712": "Can that, with any sort of justice, be styled a blunder?",
  "29713": "But may I not write a note to tell him why I cannot come?",
  "29714": "Meanin' aour packets?",
  "29715": "Why did he do it?",
  "29716": "Has his housekeeper gone too?",
  "29717": "What do you like?",
  "29718": "You have observed that?",
  "29719": "She and I were like sisters, and now she is gone, will you not let me be like a sister to you in your trouble?",
  "29720": "And is there any opposite to life?",
  "29721": "Well?",
  "29722": "Don't you think that people are most conceited of all about their sensual powers?",
  "29723": "What am I to do if I love nothing but fame and men's esteem?",
  "29724": "What do you see there?",
  "29725": "How should a man tell you who knows everything?",
  "29726": "Of what did he die?",
  "29727": "The convicts?",
  "29728": "Don't you know that their attorneys have noticed us that they have withdrawn the suit?",
  "29729": "Who was ever successful in true love?",
  "29730": "Don't you see that by the very fact of your choosing her you prove that you do not know what is best for you?",
  "29731": "Does he?",
  "29732": "Can't you take my word?",
  "29733": "Why should we not get him?",
  "29734": "Ladislaw?",
  "29735": "Does he accept?",
  "29736": "Could it be possible that she should her have to encounter another amorous swain?",
  "29737": "If I catch him there again, shall I have the right to thrash him and her also?",
  "29738": "Is not this the time for us to go back?",
  "29739": "Very reserved, isn't he?",
  "29740": "Ha, what?",
  "29741": "If so, whose?",
  "29742": "And what do you want to do now?",
  "29743": "And the windows too?",
  "29744": "But do you know, gentlemen, what was the chief point about my spite?",
  "29745": "Is there anything the matter, father?",
  "29746": "How do you cure the shivers?",
  "29747": "You have lost one of your boots?",
  "29748": "How comes it that he is unknown?",
  "29749": "What sort of a man is that?",
  "29750": "You have been into the church?",
  "29751": "Is it so beautiful as all that?",
  "29752": "Well, what are you doing there, then?",
  "29753": "Are you used to burglary, may I ask?",
  "29754": "Can't I come back to your rooms?",
  "29755": "And you are NOT, I presume, eh?",
  "29756": "I wonder why?",
  "29757": "Would he come and see her in spite of his mother?",
  "29758": "Wouldn't you rather come in here, to me?",
  "29759": "And what did they see?",
  "29760": "What sort of lives do the majority of folk lead?",
  "29761": "What in the act of offering?",
  "29762": "What could I say, what could I do?",
  "29763": "Know you which, of all his wives, possessed these in the highest degree?",
  "29764": "If they do this, how are we to know when they mean what they say, and of what value can their evidence on points of culture be reckoned?",
  "29765": "Then the soul is immortal?",
  "29766": "Yes, yes, it's your sting, and you are a wasp, that's what you are, a wasp, do you hear?",
  "29767": "Can a man be too cruel to his mother's enemy?",
  "29768": "What child can that be?",
  "29769": "We are to meet as usual?",
  "29770": "Why can I not, on the contrary, say ill enough of her to prevent your going to her?",
  "29771": "But there's good art in me?",
  "29772": "Where is the commander in chief?",
  "29773": "And how do you like it?",
  "29774": "And higher still?",
  "29775": "What does that matter to me?",
  "29776": "Shall I tell you how it will be?",
  "29777": "And who are the really clever men, after all?",
  "29778": "For what other reason can you have laid your plans to talk in this way to such a woman as I am?",
  "29779": "It may come to that, that we must leave this place, but till that time comes, why should your young days be clouded?",
  "29780": "You won't do it again, eh?",
  "29781": "Why then does their rump look toward heaven?",
  "29782": "Has he not all the tricks of a demon at his command?",
  "29783": "What intonation of voice?",
  "29784": "You are coming to sup with me, are you not?",
  "29785": "Making ready for a move?",
  "29786": "But you guess it now, do you not?",
  "29787": "What was it he saw that made his heart stand still?",
  "29788": "Wasn't it all for your good, viper?",
  "29789": "Alas, what would become of me who can only atone for evil by doing good?",
  "29790": "Is the case so desperate?",
  "29791": "What did he do that for?",
  "29792": "If it was indeed that she had in her own person a dual existence, what might happen when the two existences became one?",
  "29793": "If there be no water of unchanging fluidity, how can there be the unreal and temporary forms of waves?",
  "29794": "You are here already, are you, my gentleman?",
  "29795": "Who are you, dear?",
  "29796": "Waste?",
  "29797": "Then what would you like to do until your uncle comes back?",
  "29798": "If you can't see it yourself, why try to debar me?",
  "29799": "Bless the girl, what are you shivering about?",
  "29800": "Said he, and stamped with his foot, am I to be questioned thus by such a one as you?",
  "29801": "Then where is he?",
  "29802": "Were you obliged to have medical attendance?",
  "29803": "Has any horse got loose?",
  "29804": "And after him have you had no love?",
  "29805": "Where have you had your information?",
  "29806": "What is your meaning?",
  "29807": "With YOU?",
  "29808": "Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?",
  "29809": "What is a man the worse for dying?",
  "29810": "What constitutional maxim is there which applies to the former and not to the latter?",
  "29811": "Shall I arrange?",
  "29812": "Deer?",
  "29813": "Orders?",
  "29814": "He may have reported to you what he pleased, but could not I do the same by him?",
  "29815": "Why doesn't he get something to do?",
  "29816": "Why couldn't he have made up his mind last night?",
  "29817": "Who doubts that?",
  "29818": "Why, to accuse the man, do you address the woman?",
  "29819": "Have I any time to spare?",
  "29820": "Well, what does she want now?",
  "29821": "Haven't you got anything worse than this?",
  "29822": "But do you know why I am saying all this?",
  "29823": "Do you not come in the king's name?",
  "29824": "Shall we dress it here, as usual?",
  "29825": "Why should I fright ye?",
  "29826": "Between whom?",
  "29827": "Will you be my ally, my lady?",
  "29828": "Now then, where's your chief's quarters?",
  "29829": "Is that an aphorism or a cliche?",
  "29830": "What meaneth this restless wagging of her slouchy chaps?",
  "29831": "It gives a lonely man a sort of hankering, doesn't it?",
  "29832": "Ain't you afraid of it, sir?",
  "29833": "And anything else?",
  "29834": "You really won't meet the rest of them?",
  "29835": "How do I know it?",
  "29836": "But what's to be done?",
  "29837": "What is a trousseau?",
  "29838": "Where's the burnisher?",
  "29839": "The ruler may impose the laws and institutions which we have been describing, and the citizens may possibly be willing to obey them?",
  "29840": "You did not send to me?",
  "29841": "Monsieur, can you expose me to the cruel trial of never seeing you again?",
  "29842": "The kind that wear skins?",
  "29843": "Who shall say what he did think?",
  "29844": "Yet is it tangible and real wealth?",
  "29845": "Of work as well?",
  "29846": "Would it not be better if the end did come, the very end?",
  "29847": "No, never?",
  "29848": "Has the whelp been playing that game long?",
  "29849": "Is there no mission in thy native land, O planeticose and exallotriote spirit?",
  "29850": "And what has he said to that?",
  "29851": "And your friend still longs to be made a baron?",
  "29852": "Would you tell me, please?",
  "29853": "Did you put any thing particular in it?",
  "29854": "But would the end really be his own convenience?",
  "29855": "I suppose I'd better not come back with him?",
  "29856": "Does a flower appeal to him?",
  "29857": "Yes, she's as good as they make 'em, and she's all the female I possess and spoiled in consequence, aren't you, old girl?",
  "29858": "What do you know?",
  "29859": "What then could I against the will of heaven?",
  "29860": "Will you allow me to whisper half a syllable, sir?",
  "29861": "Whence arises this fault?",
  "29862": "Would you like a cup of tea?",
  "29863": "In this state of the case, my friends, why is the country agitated?",
  "29864": "You are rich, then, I suppose?",
  "29865": "But how about the tennis?",
  "29866": "Did he mean that literally?",
  "29867": "Hadn't you better say two fifty?",
  "29868": "If the infected were removed, why not mention it?",
  "29869": "Which is it to be?",
  "29870": "Then he will no more have true opinion than he will have knowledge about the goodness or badness of his imitations?",
  "29871": "You have seen him?",
  "29872": "What men are safe if this is done?",
  "29873": "Does she think so?",
  "29874": "Why don't you ask him?",
  "29875": "Does it hurt to be invis'ble?",
  "29876": "You don't think I do it because I like it, do you?",
  "29877": "Is that correct?",
  "29878": "Girl number twenty, isn't this a prosperous nation, and a'n't you in a thriving state?",
  "29879": "Had you, then, that sum?",
  "29880": "Our lease expires when?",
  "29881": "Who are you who speaks out of the darkness?",
  "29882": "Are they to have the fame of such as they go through, and we the labour?",
  "29883": "Yes, yes, it should be a pleasure, the greatest of all, perhaps, for is not killing the next thing to creating?",
  "29884": "Should you also like to be maid of honor?",
  "29885": "What discovery?",
  "29886": "What shall we do with our sleds?",
  "29887": "What big house is that just ahead, please?",
  "29888": "What will you do with yourself for the time?",
  "29889": "You have kissed the queen's hand?",
  "29890": "But when will that come to pass?",
  "29891": "Will you promise?",
  "29892": "Why do you give me this shame?",
  "29893": "Its name?",
  "29894": "I say, why have you been so rotten since I came back?",
  "29895": "On what subject shall I converse with her?",
  "29896": "Have you taken any precautions?",
  "29897": "You have unmasked this false prince also?",
  "29898": "Were you walking in your sleep?",
  "29899": "Won't you love me?",
  "29900": "Are you aware, sir, that we have gone to enormous expense to resist this iniquitous attempt of yours?",
  "29901": "Will you hold the horse while I stick them on?",
  "29902": "Well, then, I must go?",
  "29903": "Is it the solitary cell you want?",
  "29904": "An't you cold?",
  "29905": "Have you anything to say?",
  "29906": "You were not surprised, I dare say?",
  "29907": "How can I help laws?",
  "29908": "You could not tell vs if his sonne were there?",
  "29909": "Do you mean to say you don't hear anything?",
  "29910": "Who is his master?",
  "29911": "No garters?",
  "29912": "What is it that you think I shall do?",
  "29913": "What, you here too, prince?",
  "29914": "What in the world was this hall used for?",
  "29915": "Who would believe him?",
  "29916": "Offended me, boy?",
  "29917": "You know how to support losses?",
  "29918": "What were they doing now?",
  "29919": "I guess you'll mind your parts o' speech, and study the ACCIDENCE agin afore you let your clapper run arter that fashion, won't you?",
  "29920": "Then we should be able to ascertain if the BRITANNIA had left any traces of her shipwreck there?",
  "29921": "What are you going to flog that man for, sir?",
  "29922": "What is he going to do?",
  "29923": "Must we always kill the people?",
  "29924": "Now what was the colonel to do?",
  "29925": "May I ask what is the cause of this unseemly noise?",
  "29926": "If it should break forth into a storm, who can insure us that in its progress a part of its fury would not be spent upon us?",
  "29927": "I'm going to be good, but can't you be good running round just as well as sitting still?",
  "29928": "How can we prevent that?",
  "29929": "Can't we go overside a piece?",
  "29930": "Might I come some other day?",
  "29931": "Go for a soldier, do you mean?",
  "29932": "But what did the mere reckoning of years matter when he felt as young in heart as he had been twenty years ago?",
  "29933": "How could a garden be shut up?",
  "29934": "Your wife or your daughter?",
  "29935": "So that you could see he knew what was between the two wretches?",
  "29936": "But who is there in the world that can boast of having fathomed or understood the wavering mind and unstable nature of a woman?",
  "29937": "Did you ever behold streets so insufferably narrow, or houses so miraculously tall?",
  "29938": "How can they know?",
  "29939": "Is it to make me a captain?",
  "29940": "What IS the matter with it?",
  "29941": "Would that surprise you?",
  "29942": "But would he come?",
  "29943": "How do you know I was praying, sir?",
  "29944": "Who looks after the sick here?",
  "29945": "Can'tyou walk yet?",
  "29946": "Who can make him out?",
  "29947": "To whom do I address it?",
  "29948": "But where was mine?",
  "29949": "Am I, indeed, so happy?",
  "29950": "Hemlock, do you mean?",
  "29951": "How could you possibly know that?",
  "29952": "Why so insensible to my uncle's interests?",
  "29953": "And the possibility has been acknowledged?",
  "29954": "Your ruin?",
  "29955": "Do you mean in point of reward?",
  "29956": "But how long have you been here that you are ignorant of all this?",
  "29957": "Haven't you put a drop of poison in that remark now, eh?",
  "29958": "Would there ever come to him a time of freedom?",
  "29959": "Will you bear, therefore, will you bear to see your sanctuary trampled on?",
  "29960": "Even if the squire should afterwards hear of his having been there, what would it matter?",
  "29961": "She said I was prudent and virtuous?",
  "29962": "How are you to get away from here?",
  "29963": "You are confident that the thief came in a cab?",
  "29964": "That's what it always comes to, doesn't it?",
  "29965": "What could he want?",
  "29966": "That was something in this way, warn't it?",
  "29967": "Why not have kept hold of it with both hands, with both knees, when it was about to flee from her?",
  "29968": "But to what does all this lead?",
  "29969": "Hasn't she always you?",
  "29970": "How do the bass chords run?",
  "29971": "Shall I send the servant to direct you?",
  "29972": "How much is the whole?",
  "29973": "And who instructed you, eh?",
  "29974": "Do you know anything of his history?",
  "29975": "Was she ever as pretty as my mother is now?",
  "29976": "But the puzzle is, who are the teachers?",
  "29977": "How could you be cruel to me?",
  "29978": "But well carried out, eh?",
  "29979": "How did you fare?",
  "29980": "Who does it come from?",
  "29981": "What happened within her?",
  "29982": "Whom had he to consult but himself now?",
  "29983": "What differences from terrestrial conditions will ensue?",
  "29984": "Isn't there a lot of hope in it?",
  "29985": "What stable?",
  "29986": "Do I look ugly?",
  "29987": "To relieve thy breast?",
  "29988": "Can you lift me into that tree and put a rifle in my hands?",
  "29989": "Shall I tell you what you were thinking to yourself just then?",
  "29990": "But what can I have to relate to you?",
  "29991": "Why is that woman always out of the way when she is most wanted?",
  "29992": "I hope you don't mind?",
  "29993": "What right had they to make me suffer like that?",
  "29994": "How long do you suppose this sea to be?",
  "29995": "Do you desire it as ardently as you say?",
  "29996": "If nature suddenly should give that beast a tail, would he not be prouder of it than all the other foxes in the wood?",
  "29997": "Watch and listen, won't you, so that you can give me your impression after the first act?",
  "29998": "Who could have said so the evening before?",
  "29999": "Very good?",
  "30000": "Are you likely to be more humane to me than others were yesterday?",
  "30001": "Was it my imagination that there was an undertone of fear rather than of hope in the question?",
  "30002": "What could have caused it?",
  "30003": "Is he a scholar, or a soldier?",
  "30004": "And to confer upon me the favour of your distinguished recommendation?",
  "30005": "How can he keep him?",
  "30006": "Surely you have felt that it is so?",
  "30007": "Could there be a development of knowledge in the absence of curiosity?",
  "30008": "Do the old fellows bother you?",
  "30009": "If what?",
  "30010": "And how have you been getting on?",
  "30011": "But you, sir?",
  "30012": "Did you see?",
  "30013": "Who is your favorite author?",
  "30014": "You think this old monkey in here knows what you say?",
  "30015": "What would you gain by it?",
  "30016": "You've been picking the flowers, hey?",
  "30017": "But are you so sure, so very sure of her?",
  "30018": "If I get your grandpa to apologize for the shaking, will you give up running away?",
  "30019": "Who's here?",
  "30020": "Don't you think that this has lasted long enough?",
  "30021": "Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring?",
  "30022": "And it is asked by what authority this bold and radical innovation was undertaken?",
  "30023": "I asked him upon this if he ever disputed with his wife?",
  "30024": "Sirrah, who gave you a commission to lie in my lordship?",
  "30025": "How can I tell?",
  "30026": "How could I let him?",
  "30027": "What hand and brain went ever pair'd?",
  "30028": "Why did you write me such a horrid letter, you naughty boy?",
  "30029": "Or can I ever see one?",
  "30030": "Quite?",
  "30031": "What is she vexed with him about?",
  "30032": "To do that, my joy?",
  "30033": "And later?",
  "30034": "But what language is it?",
  "30035": "Wouldn't YOU?",
  "30036": "Lucy dear, do you know why I tell you all this?",
  "30037": "How did they come to love each other?",

  "30710": "And ignorance and folly are inanitions of the soul?",
  "30711": "What is that opinion?",
  "30712": "Would she cry, and wish that she had a right to put her arms around his neck and comfort him?",
  "30713": "How are they getting on with the fight?",
  "30714": "Who was I?",
  "30715": "Except yourself?",

  "31639": "Is it very important news?",
  "31640": "What on earth can she have gone there for?",
  "31641": "You'll do it, then?",
  "31642": "But what are these shocking screams?",
  "31643": "And the new system is one of your own invention?",
  "31644": "Isn't it a dog?",
  "31645": "What does the king wish?",
  "31646": "What have they taken a baby in there for?",
  "31647": "My wife came to your house to reclaim her father?",
  "31648": "Why, how can you be dissatisfied with yourself if you are happy?",
  "31649": "But what do you mean by the highest of all knowledge?",
  "31650": "Do you remember what I saw?",
  "31651": "Why should I do that?",

  "31671": "Or, what encouragement is there left to continue throwing good money after bad?",
  "31672": "Yes, how do you know it?",
  "31673": "May not this affectation of a false stoicism come from the same source as his recognition of the right of property?",

  "31713": "Where could they be?",
  "31714": "Ah, now, what do you take me for?",
  "31715": "Can not it?",
  "31716": "For a hunt and a gallop, eh?",
  "31717": "And why are you permitted to go at large, unwatched?",
  "31718": "Can't you let an old woman babble on paper once in a way?",
  "31719": "Anne, what want you here?",
  "31720": "But what is he, I dinno?",
  "31721": "Is this quite certain?",
  "31722": "Where is he hiding?",
  "31723": "You dare to talk of your child?",
  "31724": "Can you not give me that information here?",
  "31725": "How say you, cousin?",
  "31726": "Can your horse do it, or can't he?",
  "31727": "But what is it now?",
  "31728": "Are you sure?",
  "31729": "Le mot d'ordre?",
  "31730": "We can't send for the whole medical faculty, can we, to treat your gout?",
  "31731": "Why, that way?",
  "31732": "Have you put the lunch in?",
  "31733": "How then had he been able to explain, and in such language, the number of things that he could not have said so well before?",
  "31734": "What, is it right?",
  "31735": "Well, and how do you do?",
  "31736": "And the king?",
  "31737": "Am I not already in the grave?",
  "31738": "Don't you see how the water boils and bubbles?",
  "31739": "What shall I say to him first?",
  "31740": "What promise?",
  "31741": "And will he talk thus of affairs in presence of two strangers?",
  "31742": "What would the issue of it be?",
  "31743": "And why?",
  "31744": "How long you been this way?",
  "31745": "But all this entails expense, and upon whom is this to fall?",
  "31746": "Is this the origin of the zodiacal light?",
  "31747": "With such alternatives, what would be the fate of the travelers?",
  "31748": "Is the fracture recent?",
  "31749": "Now are you ready to tell, boys?",
  "31750": "I suppose you have a garage there?",
  "31751": "That would meet the situation?",
  "31752": "Was this well done, young gentleman?",
  "31753": "You haven't heard about the school, I suppose?",
  "31754": "If he could see the projectile through the glass of his gigantic telescope, what would he think?",
  "31755": "Meaning what?",
  "31756": "What's the exact state of affairs as regards myself?",
  "31757": "Or you have overheard the servants talk?",
  "31758": "Tom, what's the matter with you?",
  "31759": "Who brought it into this room, then?",
  "31760": "But who do you suppose our other friend is?",
  "31761": "Why do you wish you were dead?",
  "31762": "Why, what do I keep you for?",
  "31763": "And JIM?",
  "31764": "But, pray, what pretty neat damsel was with you?",
  "31765": "Just like one of the peasants, all day long?",
  "31766": "Little boy, what do you want?",
  "31767": "Why shouldn't a woman?",
  "31768": "Where is there any water?",
  "31769": "How could I say such cruel things to her?",
  "31770": "I have caught you, have I?",
  "31771": "What are they talking about, and why doesn't he go back?",
  "31772": "Hadn't you better take up some line where they'll come in handy?",
  "31773": "Yes, that's it, she means to elope with him, but what am I to do?",
  "31774": "Leave tonight?",
  "31775": "What would you throw out?",
  "31776": "How would you like being kept awake for an hour in the middle of the night because her ladyship wouldn't go to sleep?",
  "31777": "What did the king say to you?",
  "31778": "Should I be getting your teas ready, while you do that?",
  "31779": "Do you know me?",
  "31780": "What vessel is that?",
  "31781": "Or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected?",
  "31782": "Shall we swear to each other, one day?",
  "31783": "Why are we there ?",
  "31784": "Not even me?",
  "31785": "Ah, ha, that's it, is it?",
  "31786": "There is a great improvement here, ma'am?",
  "31787": "Why does he want them?",
  "31788": "Broughton, just get a policeman, will you?",
  "31789": "Would he succeed in coming face to face with the girl he was seeking?",
  "31790": "Whatever do you mean?",
  "31791": "And what went wrong?",
  "31792": "Yes honey, but what's the matter with you, precious?",
  "31793": "Will not the capture of one army after another satisfy him, must all become prisoners?",
  "31794": "How will they get at it?",
  "31795": "Expenses paid, and a moderate screw?",
  "31796": "Was she expecting a visitor?",
  "31797": "Thinks I, what does it mean?",
  "31798": "Were's it gorn?",
  "31799": "How's that?",
  "31800": "Now you, sir, will you answer me or not?",
  "31801": "I take back the ring, after it has passed through the hands of that infamous creature?",
  "31802": "Why don't I what?",
  "31803": "And what did he find?",
  "31804": "Is it sure promised?",
  "31805": "What is the trial for, when he is not here and will never return?",
  "31806": "What a shameful disorder in nature, is it not, to make war against women?",
  "31807": "Whereabouts will she be?",
  "31808": "Am I not your comrade?",
  "31809": "But, suppose we should rise up tomorrow and emancipate, who would educate these millions, and teach them how to use their freedom?",
  "31810": "And he has gone, you say?",
  "31811": "Would you go and be dependent on your friends?",
  "31812": "H'm, then you DO give him money?",
  "31813": "Is she, then, preparing for a stroke?",
  "31814": "Where should good news come from to me?",
  "31815": "Well, and what woman don't I should like to know?",
  "31816": "It is midnight?",
  "31817": "Will you have them fetched back?",

  "31833": "Did I not give express orders that I would have no smoking in the office?",
  "31834": "Alive?",
  "31835": "And yet what necessity was there for his having a regular master?",
  "31836": "And who on earth, after the daily experience we have, can question the probability of a gentleman marrying anybody?",
  "31837": "How did you get it?",
  "31838": "Cried the other 'Why are you pelting me?",
  "31839": "How do they call you?",

  "32439": "WHY, you dear delightful woman, did you like it?",
  "32440": "Who is knocking?",
  "32441": "That was intended, I think, wasn't it?",
  "32442": "How can you speak of it in that way?",
  "32443": "Do you mean that we are going to die too?",
  "32444": "Why not stay here now and be quiet?",
  "32445": "You have since reflected?",
  "32446": "Do you think your hotel man will open his hotel this month?",
  "32447": "Helen, you wouldn't think I'd invent that?",
  "32448": "Is that all, gentlemen?",
  "32449": "Why should you be inconvenienced?",
  "32450": "Thed what are you?",
  "32451": "Did anyone ever hear the like?",
  "32452": "Is there too much vanity in what I have just said?",
  "32453": "What is that?",
  "32454": "You would not marry him, now that he is free?",
  "32455": "And the unjust is good and wise, and the just is neither?",
  "32456": "Who wrote it?",
  "32457": "Now, was that somebody brother to the prisoner at the bar?",
  "32458": "You don't happen to know why they killed the pig, do you?",
  "32459": "Well, does the colonel treat you well?",
  "32460": "How long are we to endure it?",
  "32461": "What is it that I manage?",
  "32462": "Quite so, but it seems rather an absurd blind, does it not?",
  "32463": "You made paper, pens and ink?",
  "32464": "But why talk now?",
  "32465": "Is he perchance thy son?",
  "32466": "Is it a renewal of the former proposition or what?",
  "32467": "But what to do?",
  "32468": "Shall we charge them or no?",
  "32469": "Why should I tire you with particulars of my consequence?",
  "32470": "Then why do you apply to me?",
  "32471": "If it were alive, wouldn't it trot, and prance, and eat oats?",
  "32472": "And have they appointed the matron?",
  "32473": "And why not?",
  "32474": "Has a girl of fourteen a heart large enough, vigorous enough, to hold the swelling spring of pure, full, fervid eloquence?",
  "32475": "I understand you to say that there are three students who use this stair, and are in the habit of passing your door?",
  "32476": "Our neighbor?",
  "32477": "Where would they meet?",
  "32478": "How was it I noticed nothing?",
  "32479": "Where are you going, bandit?",
  "32480": "You do not doubt his affection?",
  "32481": "What orders?",
  "32482": "Can you walk?",
  "32483": "Even allowing that she does not love him, that she pays no heed to her vows and promises, how can she give herself to another man?",
  "32484": "Who gave her away?",
  "32485": "To what had he brought himself?",
  "32486": "What can be done for it?",
  "32487": "Is everything as it should be?",
  "32488": "I trust he does not suffer?",
  "32489": "How do you mean, the general?",
  "32490": "And how many hours a day did you do lessons?",
  "32491": "Is it a very wicked place?",
  "32492": "Why had our incomprehensible guide led us to the bottom of this submarine crypt?",
  "32493": "What are you doing tonight?",
  "32494": "Will you take me away with you?",
  "32495": "I hope we are not to part as enemies?",
  "32496": "Ah, dear sister, how can I answer this question?",
  "32497": "Why will you think so?",
  "32498": "What could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as it dropped on her work?",
  "32499": "Do you mean me, sir?",
  "32500": "Did he not pretend to go back to his tribe, who had treated him ill, and driven him from their wigwams like a dog?",
  "32501": "But how can we find the way in this fog?",
  "32502": "Had he noticed that the days had been only six hours long, and that the weight of the atmosphere was so much diminished?",
  "32503": "What was the man doing when you saw him?",
  "32504": "What does all this knowing mean to me?",
  "32505": "Might not that person by patient waiting be covering silent preparation, and proving his fitness for the glorious task before him?",
  "32506": "But what if it's worse than this?",
  "32507": "Not HE?",
  "32508": "Do I try and catch them?",
  "32509": "Still inquisitive?",
  "32510": "Is it my fault if fortune, which has frowned on you, has been kind to me?",
  "32511": "You haf not got something to drink, hey?",
  "32512": "Yes, dear?",
  "32513": "Art shod with lead?",
  "32514": "Wherein have I hurt you?",
  "32515": "He is in, is there another room whence she can hear him?",
  "32516": "Will our help come from you?",
  "32517": "How should there be eighteen copies, all different from the original, and from one another, in minor matters?",
  "32518": "In the meantime, who can foretell what would be the sufferings and privations of the people during its existence?",
  "32519": "What is it, grandmother?",
  "32520": "If we could get a drink?",
  "32521": "Is it not the duty of the nations to combine and to relieve suffering humanity?",
  "32522": "Then that is not the knowledge which we are seeking to discover?",
  "32523": "You met a monk, did you not?",
  "32524": "Can I not read your heart?",
  "32525": "You don't KNOW?",
  "32526": "What, it seems I do not drink but by an attorney?",
  "32527": "What was the cause of this flaw?",
  "32528": "Shall I give her?",
  "32529": "Was it right to be frightened already?",
  "32530": "Why can't they do as I have done, ma'am?",
  "32531": "At what hour would you wish the ceremony performed?",
  "32532": "Do you mean a compliment?",
  "32533": "Do you not know that there is a spirit within you different from flesh?",
  "32534": "In this painful moment can the best of fathers wish to destroy my domestic happiness, the only kind which now remains to me?",
  "32535": "What struggle was going on within him?",
  "32536": "So that he still expects his money?",
  "32537": "Why don't you open the door for papa?",
  "32538": "What will become of us if she dies, as I always fear when her face is like that?",
  "32539": "And if not, is he a devil?",
  "32540": "You your command, and I my title?",
  "32541": "Why has she not written to me, then?",
  "32542": "By this train?",
  "32543": "Are they good to eat?",
  "32544": "Will we trample again upon that torn and mangled corpse?",
  "32545": "And who can wonder if it be so, mother?",
  "32546": "Are you comfortable now, sir?",
  "32547": "Swear it was not true?",
  "32548": "What good was moral support in providing a million and a half?",
  "32549": "But can you restore him back to life?",
  "32550": "You won't consider me in your debt?",
  "32551": "I hope you're well?",
  "32552": "Did he designedly conceal some incident of his captivity?",
  "32553": "You remember that young fellow mother wanted me to have?",
  "32554": "So there are fashions, nowadays, in illness, are there?",
  "32555": "Then, sir, you are a favourite, I find, among the ladies?",
  "32556": "Do he rave about his mother just the same, poor fellow?",
  "32557": "Where is it?",
  "32558": "Yours then are rather here?",
  "32559": "Are you in a position to quit the post of superintendent at this moment?",
  "32560": "Do you observe anything remarkable about that?",
  "32561": "How was this to be done?",
  "32562": "Have you never heard talk of a certain secret?",
  "32563": "Did he come here voluntarily?",
  "32564": "Wouldn't you?",
  "32565": "What do you really think of her?",
  "32566": "When did he give it you?",
  "32567": "Unintentionally?",
  "32568": "Harry?",
  "32569": "Am I to come home?",
  "32570": "And the result of the examination?",
  "32571": "His ELDER brother?",
  "32572": "Perhaps he was expected to utter certain words?",
  "32573": "Supposing he is loyal, can any of his requests be granted, and if any, which of them?",
  "32574": "Are you sure you are more reasonable?",
  "32575": "Shall I go in first?",
  "32576": "What will you warm yourself with this winter?",
  "32577": "How is it they come to you?",
  "32578": "What have you got there?",
  "32579": "Have you your carriage?",
  "32580": "Do you think that you will catch anything?",
  "32581": "What is she lying down for?",
  "32582": "Who said she knew him?",
  "32583": "How do you find yourself this morning, sir?",
  "32584": "And what would you call this?",
  "32585": "How think you of that?",
  "32586": "Does she?",
  "32587": "What is that water?",
  "32588": "Going on?",
  "32589": "What palace may it deck?",
  "32590": "Reversed?",
  "32591": "Are you going to sit down, or are you not?",
  "32592": "Oh, master, what are you saying?",
  "32593": "Don't you remember that THAT, originally, was what we were to get her for?",
  "32594": "Were you ever there?",
  "32595": "Ain't you going to do anything, sir?",
  "32596": "Do you see what a villain he is?",
  "32597": "Don't you think a good deal is done when you come out and talk to me this way?",
  "32598": "And yet, when I was at my father's, did not the men give up their gayest balls and parties in order to pass the evening with me?",
  "32599": "But I want to know why the word 'moor' should have been written?",
  "32600": "We sent you wine?",
  "32601": "When did you get the letter?",
  "32602": "What is indispensable to you?",
  "32603": "What have I said?",
  "32604": "But how could you be sure I would know it?",
  "32605": "Tell me, I entreat of you, who and what you are?",
  "32606": "Had he not seduced his sisters, one after the other?",
  "32607": "Might I speak to you with regard to that matter of his grace, sir?",
  "32608": "You mean to say our old raft warn't smashed all to flinders?",
  "32609": "Must I close this?",
  "32610": "The world is surely not worth living in now, is it?",
  "32611": "And was this the man?",
  "32612": "What's the time?",
  "32613": "What's queer?",
  "32614": "But was he a lawyer after all?",
  "32615": "What house will they take?",
  "32616": "Was it well?",
  "32617": "Could it be done?",
  "32618": "Why should I stand in a comrade's way?",
  "32619": "What else should I stay on for?",
  "32620": "What beings surround me?",
  "32621": "What judgment?",
  "32622": "D'Epinay?",
  "32623": "Well, hain't he got a father?",
  "32624": "Are you certain of what you say, monsieur?",
  "32625": "And the reason is that each part of him is doing its own business, whether in ruling or being ruled?",
  "32626": "You want it, I expect?",
  "32627": "Had he been fooled once more?",
  "32628": "Do you seriously believe that that machine has travelled into time?",
  "32629": "What says our graver sister?",
  "32630": "Can I do anything?",
  "32631": "Ain't you seen the rag this week?",
  "32632": "What passage is that?",
  "32633": "But does she now dissolve the union?",
  "32634": "Any way out of that yard, now?",
  "32635": "Waw shouldn't I git a bit o me own back?",
  "32636": "Have those who have had their share in oligarchies been peculiarly wise and peculiarly devoted to the common good?",
  "32637": "What was there to be done in the village?",
  "32638": "What should I tell?",
  "32639": "Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad?",
  "32640": "To what purpose?",
  "32641": "And if it is labor that creates wealth and legitimates property, how explain the consumption of the idler?",
  "32642": "What did you mean by that?",
  "32643": "Well, what do YOU make of it?",
  "32644": "Are there any?",
  "32645": "And if I refuse to retract, you wish to fight, do you?",
  "32646": "Dora, what has happened to you?",
  "32647": "Where have you been sleeping all this week?",
  "32648": "But what do you gather from it?",
  "32649": "Well, ain't you going to save any of it?",
  "32650": "Then how could you know?",
  "32651": "Are you much hurt?",
  "32652": "Daunted?",
  "32653": "And why should you try to deceive me by telling a tale?",
  "32654": "Can I come, with my doll?",
  "32655": "Are you sorry for hiring me, master?",
  "32656": "Yes my boy?",
  "32657": "Why this man saved and that man lost?",
  "32658": "Aren't they beautiful?",
  "32659": "How has my judgment wander'd?",
  "32660": "You know what I mean?",
  "32661": "What, sweetheart?",
  "32662": "What sort of a place is it?",
  "32663": "Well, I vow, that's what the sea folks call sailing UNDER BARE POLES, come true, aint it?",
  "32664": "Who took his hands out of mine?",
  "32665": "I insist upon your living, do you hear?",
  "32666": "Why on earth did you ask him to dine with us?",
  "32667": "A man's or a woman's?",
  "32668": "Was she sheering off?",
  "32669": "What say your old men?",
  "32670": "Monsieur d'Artagnan, will you do me a favor?",
  "32671": "Are not the quail, the pigeon and the partridge the natural prey of the hawk?",
  "32672": "From the country, I see, sir?",
  "32673": "Would prudence or gratitude allow the pontiffs to renounce their benefactor?",
  "32674": "Why must their ruffs be always crinkled like endive leaves, and not crimped with a crimping iron?",
  "32675": "To whom is it they should have recourse?",
  "32676": "But who is there that ever heard of such an instinct?",
  "32677": "Well, but what am I to do?",
  "32678": "Subdivide?",
  "32679": "What is the colour of the men?",
  "32680": "What's the pay?",
  "32681": "Because I sigh when thinking of some one I am leaving?",
  "32682": "Whom did you play with?",
  "32683": "Do they work worse?",
  "32684": "You're not worried about anything?",
  "32685": "Are you sure you know the way?",
  "32686": "Why not make him a doctor like his father?",
  "32687": "But what was that to her, or to any one but myself?",
  "32688": "A little fancy work?",
  "32689": "Where are you off to?",
  "32690": "Yes, but if we can't help them?",
  "32691": "What's set you a snivelling now?",
  "32692": "And who is to do the parish work?",
  "32693": "Are you well fed?",
  "32694": "Well, why don't they support us?",
  "32695": "How many years do you mean to live after I am gone?",
  "32696": "What could these people do?",
  "32697": "Do you think I would leave you?",
  "32698": "And what do you call all this?",
  "32699": "Is it anything bad?",
  "32700": "Is it of course?",
  "32701": "But now what?",
  "32702": "Where did the buffaloes kill him?",
  "32703": "Where is it?",
  "32704": "Would these two travellers make much difference to the horses, if we took them with us?",
  "32705": "Shall we not bear the trials of life a little longer in patience?",
  "32706": "How can they recognize you, if you act in such a manner that no one can recognize you?",
  "32707": "What is it you smell of?",
  "32708": "Forgotten, indeed?",
  "32709": "Were you at the performance last evening?",
  "32710": "How have you got on?",
  "32711": "Why had she allowed him to understand that he was master of her heart?",
  "32712": "Paying the money, I suppose?",
  "32713": "May one venture to ask you, monsieur, on what you have reflected?",
  "32714": "Are you, then, a coward?",
  "32715": "Would it not be safer and more certain if I should ask him his name and tell him yours?",
  "32716": "Why, how did he come here, mother?",
  "32717": "You'll get down, brother, won't you, and take something?",
  "32718": "Why do you say that, when you are going to this terrible war, and he is so old?",
  "32719": "Under what law, and for what offence?",
  "32720": "Easily?",
  "32721": "Why did he not take her in his arms and swear that he would never leave her?",
  "32722": "DID you hear that?",
  "32723": "Is the committee willing to hear this witness?",
  "32724": "Would you care for it?",
  "32725": "Who will be waiting for me beyond the ditch?",
  "32726": "May I?",
  "32727": "What is the stone called?",
  "32728": "Now, sir, tell me who and what that woman was?",
  "32729": "Are you one?",
  "32730": "Married?",
  "32731": "Will that do now?",
  "32732": "How shall I put it on?",
  "32733": "And to what purpose?",
  "32734": "Mouston?",
  "32735": "How is your dear mother getting on?",
  "32736": "But you know how it all ended, don't you?",
  "32737": "Why did we choose it, this foolish task?",
  "32738": "Are you an alienist?",
  "32739": "Cannot ate it?",
  "32740": "You won't give it up?",
  "32741": "You are, I imagine, still of the same opinion?",
  "32742": "Or not you so much, perhaps, as your friend in the city?",
  "32743": "Did you ask her how much?",
  "32744": "Is there no force on this side of the creek?",
  "32745": "If I guess rightly, will you confess it?",
  "32746": "Did you ever hear a definition of fame, sir?",
  "32747": "Ay, but how shall we know the catchpole?",
  "32748": "What harm is there in that?",
  "32749": "Why are there men and women that while they are nigh me the sunlight expands my blood?",
  "32750": "Why, according to popular belief is it rather characterised by the very contrary?",
  "32751": "Shall we hold it as a province and govern it by despotic power?",
  "32752": "My dear doctor, what is my wife's complaint?",
  "32753": "Do we go all the way today?",
  "32754": "Oh, what does that matter?",
  "32755": "What place was there in her mind for a remonstrance to lodge in?",
  "32756": "Really and truly?",
  "32757": "If that were so, what had become of my father?",
  "32758": "But where is the last year's snow?",
  "32759": "How much will you ask to stay with her till the end?",
  "32760": "What can it be?",
  "32761": "Of whom are you jealous, now?",
  "32762": "What was the sense of that?",
  "32763": "I felt very ignorant, but what could I do?",
  "32764": "And what are you going to do with yourself now, if I may ask?",
  "32765": "What interest of hers was affected by the treaty?",
  "32766": "An order to who?",
  "32767": "Which is the stronger, the small stick that first PRODUCES the fire, or the fire itself?",
  "32768": "So you've been at the club?",
  "32769": "Don't you really?",
  "32770": "Has he been a good soldier except the desertion?",
  "32771": "Do you think not?",
  "32772": "O, it an't?",
  "32773": "What you mought call me?",
  "32774": "Full of hope?",
  "32775": "And who will go?",
  "32776": "What is the news, whence is thy embassage?",
  "32777": "Farther?",
  "32778": "Should he slip away after having come and peeped into the barricade?",
  "32779": "Perhaps?",
  "32780": "Very well, my dear sir, and how does that concern us?",
  "32781": "But will the wild ass submit to the bonds?",
  "32782": "Where is the count?",
  "32783": "A whole one, and in a candlestick?",
  "32784": "Are you?",
  "32785": "Are you going to remain as you are, dear princess?",
  "32786": "What might have been your opinion of the place?",
  "32787": "Who defeated it?",
  "32788": "Plantation hand?",
  "32789": "For us, also?",
  "32790": "What is to be done with them?",
  "32791": "What would the life of a man be if he could feel no fear or repulsion?",
  "32792": "Is it really so that I may understand you, sir?",
  "32793": "Well, dad, what do you say about it?",
  "32794": "With what consolations can those, who have thus miscarried in their chief design, elude the memory of their ill success?",
  "32795": "Why did she love everything so tenderly and so passionately, everything living that was not a man?",
  "32796": "In favor of some member of your family?",
  "32797": "You are angry, monsieur?",
  "32798": "What, he told you so, I suppose?",
  "32799": "What, have they buried him in honour for his services to them?",
  "32800": "To stand from fear set free?",
  "32801": "You are aware, I suppose, that all mythology and poetry is a narration of events, either past, present, or to come?",
  "32802": "Why do you go, sir?",
  "32803": "You called my father 'Michael' as if you knew him well?",
  "32804": "This DETOUR has been entirely for our benefit, then?",
  "32805": "What do you tell me?",
  "32806": "What was she like now?",
  "32807": "Call the captain, and heave the ship aback?",
  "32808": "And did you observe any change in her then?",
  "32809": "Flee alone, and leave you here?",
  "32810": "Can I have lost it?",
  "32811": "Are the sacrifices I have made of honour and modesty to you no proof of my being tied to you in bonds too strong to be broken?",
  "32812": "But what makes you so much out of sorts?",
  "32813": "Why, wherefore stay you?",
  "32814": "Who asked him while I was away?",
  "32815": "Don't you hear it?",
  "32816": "Jarndyce?",
  "32817": "Why, what's the matter?",
  "32818": "What does it depend upon?",
  "32819": "Now will you learn not to answer back when I speak to you?",
  "32820": "And what you think of it?",
  "32821": "But, on the other hand, did not the people evince decided obstinacy and insubordination?",
  "32822": "And my making it easy for you to see the child?",
  "32823": "Has anyone an interest in preventing your arrival there?",
  "32824": "Do you abuse your teacher?",
  "32825": "Has it struck you that we may not now choose to give over?",
  "32826": "And how do you like the place?",
  "32827": "Why do you not sit by his side and begin talking to him and asking him questions?",
  "32828": "You say papa will get better, and why shouldn't he?",
  "32829": "What have you got to be afraid of?",
  "32830": "What used he to say?",
  "32831": "Where the devil is mine?",
  "32832": "How do you feel yourself?",
  "32833": "That millions of others still exist, which are too minute for any observation?",
  "32834": "I suppose we might call her that?",
  "32835": "Don't you know that it is only very foolish folk who talk sense all the time?",
  "32836": "What's that to me?",
  "32837": "But you are sure you can act your part, and disguise your voice so that he may mistake that, as he has already mistaken your person?",
  "32838": "What would it matter if you smashed to smithereens at the end of the run, after a bust like that?",
  "32839": "Can someone have guessed our secret and dug up the watch?",
  "32840": "But what could he do but just let her see that he would make anything, everything, for her, as honourably easy as possible?",
  "32841": "How many cartridges did you say you had left?",
  "32842": "What then is worth being valued?",
  "32843": "What does this avail?",
  "32844": "This, then, was his father's residence?",
  "32845": "Fisher?",
  "32846": "Ain't there a small drop of something queer about that, eh?",
  "32847": "How like you that answer?",
  "32848": "But what shall we do?",
  "32849": "If it is a friend, why does he not show himself?",
  "32850": "Who then must decide?",
  "32851": "Can we with propriety suffer them to be rulers?",
  "32852": "Have you been here long?",
  "32853": "But why didn't you tell me?",
  "32854": "How can they suit each other?",
  "32855": "Do you see these?",
  "32856": "How do you prove that?",
  "32857": "Arsenic?",
  "32858": "Now, sir, what have you to say to me?",
  "32859": "I suppose we're going to have a talk about this?",
  "32860": "Let 'em both wait?",
  "32861": "Perhaps you would not mind walking to town with me?",
  "32862": "Love had bandaged his eyes, in order to lead him whither?",
  "32863": "It is not my intention to detain the reader by expa?",
  "32864": "Why ask?",
  "32865": "Am I to read this?",
  "32866": "Who are you then?",
  "32867": "Was there nothing to fear?",
  "32868": "But did this man hope to conceal himself effectually behind that heap of rubbish, which one need but skirt?",
  "32869": "Then it all depends on that object that you regard, for your reasons, as evidence?",
  "32870": "What if there was no rank of life in which she could now properly attach herself?",
  "32871": "Why then do philosophers look for public spirit?",
  "32872": "How many would he have?",
  "32873": "But do you know this mysterious count is a bachelor?",
  "32874": "Why strive for a coherent, satisfied life?",
  "32875": "You won't throw any more stones, will you?",
  "32876": "Intelligent you call yourselves, do you?",
  "32877": "Did men eat men?",
  "32878": "That is, he was not a boy at all, I suppose?",
  "32879": "Who knew what would have saved him?",
  "32880": "Could he not annul the verdict?",
  "32881": "How can something come out of nothing?",
  "32882": "And now, he said, what did we just now call that principle which repels the even?",
  "32883": "What is that error?",
  "32884": "What is this place?",
  "32885": "Guy, is this amount of confidence to be our stock to start the new life on?",
  "32886": "How is your head, better?",
  "32887": "What matters that?",
  "32888": "The opportunity is a good one, then?",
  "32889": "But if, in spite of all my precautions, I am at last obliged to fight, will you not be my second?",
  "32890": "May I ask you to be so kind as to inquire of all your subjects if any of them have seen a fishing hook lost in the sea?",
  "32891": "And what is your business?",
  "32892": "Had I better wait till it's three o'clock?",
  "32893": "Remember me, don't you?",
  "32894": "Aren't there really?",
  "32895": "Why are you not eating anything, gentlemen?",
  "32896": "But opals are unlucky, aren't they?",
  "32897": "Does this not amount to your stealing the annual salary from your lord?",
  "32898": "Who'd you reckon?",
  "32899": "WILL IT BE COMMUNISM?",
  "32900": "Are you a married man, sir?",
  "32901": "What dream we of?",
  "32902": "What's the good of taking it in hand now?",
  "32903": "But if he does not come?",
  "32904": "Have you any idea what became of them?",
  "32905": "Are you the little girl that comes out with the lady an' four horses?",
  "32906": "And why this ABSOLUTISM in the relations of capitalist and laborer?",
  "32907": "Is any man termed a gentleman, that is not always in the fashion?",
  "32908": "Do I ever leave you?",
  "32909": "Are you all of the same opinion?",
  "32910": "Whose was this mighty personality?",
  "32911": "Perhaps you could name the figures of a few wiolincellers of a good tone?",
  "32912": "Why don't you take it?",
  "32913": "To marrying whom?",
  "32914": "Am I wrong to come up here to see her?",
  "32915": "You heard my question?",
  "32916": "Why now should I be tempted?",
  "32917": "I'm afraid I've given you a good deal of trouble, haven't I?",
  "32918": "Where's my maid?",
  "32919": "You're able to read?",
  "32920": "What has he lived on since?",
  "32921": "And you resent it?",
  "32922": "Was it not rather a service and a kindly act?",
  "32923": "Won't that do as well?",
  "32924": "Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?",
  "32925": "How could there be when it's barely ten o'clock yet?",
  "32926": "And have you got a paper?",
  "32927": "Where is the girl who promised to marry any one who would release her brother?",
  "32928": "And all arithmetic and calculation have to do with number?",
  "32929": "How do you happen to be here?",
  "32930": "And what is the result?",
  "32931": "Don't you see that all this leads to comfort in the end?",
  "32932": "And for what have you ruined your life, if you come to think of it?",
  "32933": "Who talks of cadeaux?",
  "32934": "But did you not read that I must be alone?",
  "32935": "Do you find the prisoner guilty or not guilty?",
  "32936": "But what's happened to you?",
  "32937": "Are you lost or have the wolves eaten you?",
  "32938": "Yet why do tears blind my eyes?",
  "32939": "Why should I still be subject to these visitations of the devil, when I try so hard to keep him away?",
  "32940": "How do you know what I think?",
  "32941": "But why was the tear in her eye?",
  "32942": "Are you lonesome because you're a magician?",
  "32943": "What had taken place during those ten months?",
  "32944": "You accuse him, then?",
  "32945": "What has anybody to do with that?",
  "32946": "John, which way must we now turn?",
  "32947": "Was I not right?",
  "32948": "Why so breathless a start?",
  "32949": "And have we, at our age, been earnestly discoursing with one another all our life long only to discover that we are no better than children?",
  "32950": "Do you want to go with us?",
  "32951": "Who had taken the letters, if letters there were?",
  "32952": "At any rate, they are all reconciled to it now, I hope?",
  "32953": "And they will place them under the command of experienced veterans who will be their leaders and teachers?",
  "32954": "Even the spiritual vision, is it not at all points arrested by the continuous golden walls of the universe?",
  "32955": "What can you be dreaming of?",
  "32956": "You say again you are quite sure that it was the prisoner?",
  "32957": "Is it any new trouble?",
  "32958": "And talking about the hospital?",
  "32959": "Amid what elegancies of carved furniture, decorated walls, elaborate tapestries did they move?",
  "32960": "If they are really qualified for the task, will not their own hearts be the first to inform them of it?",
  "32961": "What sort of life were that to live?",
  "32962": "What's your trade?",
  "32963": "How could I have been so beguiled?",
  "32964": "How does I talk wild?",
  "32965": "Would we be done for?",
  "32966": "Come, now, my learned friend, what makes you hesitate?",
  "32967": "Why can't you wait?",
  "32968": "You have come far?",
  "32969": "But is she not awfully rich?",
  "32970": "Who can make good coffee?",
  "32971": "So we had better leave you?",
  "32972": "Is the downstairs door fast?",
  "32973": "Or if he is to be governed, how can he be governed well?",
  "32974": "Will you have tea here then, or go across to the house, where there's a tent on the lawn?",
  "32975": "Did you observe the colour?",
  "32976": "Nothing that can't be got over, perhaps, after all?",
  "32977": "Can it be?",
  "32978": "Will this assist in explaining the difficulty?",
  "32979": "Is not my son hungry?",
  "32980": "But you, my dear d'Artagnan, what has happened to you?",
  "32981": "You are sure of your enterprise?",
  "32982": "Have you been at the concert?",
  "32983": "What about her horse?",
  "32984": "Mamma, what am I to say to him?",
  "32985": "When is your turn to come?",
  "32986": "Had I thus come in vain into these forests and mountains?",
  "32987": "Do you call that nothing?",
  "32988": "What is it, then, which does judge about them?",
  "32989": "Shall I lend you a hand here?",
  "32990": "Damn you, what do you mean by that?",
  "32991": "And who's that tall chap standing beside her?",
  "32992": "Would any one deny this?",
  "32993": "And you didn't give him the oysters?",
  "32994": "Did they impose on each industry a proportional tax, so as to preserve a balance in the market?",
  "32995": "What should you do in my place?",
  "32996": "What more could one ask for?",
  "32997": "For who can change men's opinions?",
  "32998": "Have you decided?",
  "32999": "How is your father getting on?",
  "33000": "Were those great, stony cliffs the gates of paradise?",
  "33001": "Shall our rivers and harbors be improved?",
  "33002": "But how do you make it shine through the walls?",
  "33003": "What, do you want to leave us?",
  "33004": "Do you stand me out, mistress?",
  "33005": "How is the poor woman?",
  "33006": "Or, that she should prefer the rant of flattery to the simple accents of sincerity?",
  "33007": "Are you a gentleman?",
  "33008": "How do yer see that?",
  "33009": "Did you speak?",
  "33010": "Shall I see you again before your departure?",
  "33011": "And how are the other people getting on?",
  "33012": "Whah did ye cum from?",
  "33013": "Why should I not go?",
  "33014": "And if they are not fortifying, sire?",
  "33015": "But hark, what music is that?",
  "33016": "What do you suppose they would do to a man disarmed like me?",
  "33017": "Are you really frightened, madame?",
  "33018": "What are you doing, you stupid creature?",
  "33019": "Who will undertake it, if it be not also a service of honour?",
  "33020": "What have you heard?",
  "33021": "But as for me, what solace had I when the days of my fighting were done?",
  "33022": "You were not unfortunate, and yet you are an orphan, fatherless and motherless?",
  "33023": "Would not that have been better evidence?",
  "33024": "Where was my head when I made that grant?",
  "33025": "Wherein, then, lay the resemblance that made the young man's heart beat with a kind of retrospective excitement?",
  "33026": "How will she take it?",
  "33027": "And you order me to announce you to the duchess?",
  "33028": "What more has happened?",
  "33029": "Why did you not tell me, instead of teasing me like this?",
  "33030": "Judah told you?",
  "33031": "So far we are within the bounds of possibility, are we not?",
  "33032": "Will the train soon be in?",
  "33033": "What is your opinion?",
  "33034": "How was it, having so little in reality to conceal, that I always DID feel as if this man were finding me out?",
  "33035": "But isn't there another thing to be done?",
  "33036": "What I wanted, who can say?",
  "33037": "Do you suppose I don't think about that myself?",
  "33038": "Where is thy victory?",
  "33039": "Oh come, now, you don't mean to let on that you LIKE it?",
  "33040": "And pray how do I and these my friends around me seem to you?",
  "33041": "Ah, are you composing poetry, queen?",
  "33042": "What is the use of being exquisite if you are not seen by the best judges?",
  "33043": "Then what was the use of our coming?",
  "33044": "Why do you disappoint me so?",
  "33045": "Are you a child or a teetotum?",
  "33046": "Take head?",
  "33047": "The date?",
  "33048": "Then, when your articled time is over, you'll be a regular lawyer, I suppose?",
  "33049": "Would I do him this favour?",
  "33050": "Do you mind if I go in and tell this man to come on to us when he's finished here?",
  "33051": "Is it in this particular part, or in that other?",
  "33052": "Haven't I seen you blowing as hot as you please?",
  "33053": "Are you ready to get back the trade on those terms?",
  "33054": "To what does your ambition aspire?",
  "33055": "And all complaining, accusing?",
  "33056": "Is she like me?",
  "33057": "What, none of you?",
  "33058": "I am not blushing, for I don't think I need blush about it, need I?",
  "33059": "You will fulfill your promise to me?",
  "33060": "What sort of animal is this interest?",
  "33061": "You must have known that?",
  "33062": "Was it not I?",
  "33063": "And am I dishonest?",
  "33064": "What's the letter?",
  "33065": "Would it please you to accompany her upon the lake?",
  "33066": "Ladies and gentlemen, what is your opinion on the subject?",
  "33067": "What do you want, sir?",
  "33068": "And where can a man seek ends of any sort beyond this broad field?",
  "33069": "How came you to make such a mistake as this?",
  "33070": "Is it too late?",
  "33071": "How do you feel now?",
  "33072": "Anne, did YOU put sugar in these peas?",
  "33073": "That is to say, justice is useful when money is useless?",
  "33074": "Is not this second infinite, so to speak, subjacent to the first?",
  "33075": "And he said nothing as he died?",
  "33076": "WHO forbade you?",
  "33077": "Gallia out of place?",
  "33078": "And am I not ready to do so again?",
  "33079": "Frightened of what?",
  "33080": "Where do we go first?",
  "33081": "Where are you?",
  "33082": "How did you get yourself into this mess?",
  "33083": "It is not in your possession?",
  "33084": "Will your excellency give your name, or remain incognito?",
  "33085": "If I kept that little girl in my mind for five years, didn't I earn some part in her?",
  "33086": "Legal proceedings to prevent payment?",
  "33087": "Have you any sort of conveyance?",
  "33088": "I suppose you kissed his hand?",
  "33089": "What's in it?",
  "33090": "How dare you look into this garden?",
  "33091": "How find a straight road of progress, you men of science, of industry, of cooperation, of trades unions, and all the rest?",
  "33092": "Really?",
  "33093": "Is this gentle and lovely being lost forever?",
  "33094": "Wouldn't you?",
  "33095": "Weigh out tragedy, like butcher's meat?",
  "33096": "Happy?",
  "33097": "What mingles in the strain?",
  "33098": "What can that be, monsieur le chevalier?",
  "33099": "Why do you seek me?",
  "33100": "What, to buy gingerbread?",
  "33101": "Have the fugitives been pursued?",
  "33102": "Is he likely to marry, uncle?",
  "33103": "Not even a sou?",
  "33104": "What did he want?",
  "33105": "Of course it is very different here, but who knows how long it will last?",
  "33106": "Do you ever try to read your own face?",
  "33107": "No accident has happened to him?",
  "33108": "Yea, truly, saw ye not birdlime upon his hands?",
  "33109": "What have you to do with us?",
  "33110": "What's his name?",
  "33111": "Why, then, I would ask, do we see these lengthened shadows, which follow in the course of our political day?",
  "33112": "And how are they all?",
  "33113": "Larrey?",
  "33114": "Is this his house?",
  "33115": "Don't you think you might find some affairs there, ma'am, to interfere with?",
  "33116": "What may be thy name, good fellow?",
  "33117": "Who is the man that seeks another man?",
  "33118": "Why, do you smoke?",
  "33119": "Will you have it now?",
  "33120": "When shall we get away?",
  "33121": "Good gracious, what's that?",
  "33122": "Have you been there?",
  "33123": "Didn't I tell you to put up a fence?",
  "33124": "But why have you come the back way?",
  "33125": "What would you like to have?",
  "33126": "But does the painter know the right form of the bit and reins?",
  "33127": "Indeed?",
  "33128": "Why this jealousy of our advancement?",
  "33129": "With HER?",
  "33130": "And what is justice?",
  "33131": "But how if you and I had married legally, as we were on the point of doing?",
  "33132": "What millions, father?",
  "33133": "I suppose I had, too, but how you going to find out about things if you don't ask questions?",

  "33136": "How 't happens?",
  "33137": "Why these splendid buskins?",
  "33138": "Better than what?",
  "33139": "And may I escape by the door, sir, when I have opened it?",
  "33140": "But why with melancholy?",
  "33141": "Do you think that I deserve a recompense?",
  "33142": "Can I take the apple blossoms with me for company?",
  "33143": "How could any vanquish such a mighty antagonist?",
  "33144": "What are you dreaming of?",
  "33145": "Like whom?",
  "33146": "Hain't you got no principle at all?",
  "33147": "Why did I not fall in love with her then and propose to her?",
  "33148": "I suppose you've got your thumbs?",
  "33149": "Just's?",
  "33150": "And how long were you in the hole?",
  "33151": "What, all sons of silence, no spirit?",
  "33152": "If he fears me, why come hither?",
  "33153": "What do you reckon we better do, now?",
  "33154": "Was it for happiness they wept?",
  "33155": "Mother, may I sit on the sofa beside you?",
  "33156": "Don't you remember singing a song?",
  "33157": "False?",
  "33158": "Babies?",
  "33159": "Where did you address your letters, then?",
  "33160": "You know what they say?",
  "33161": "The first question is, of what nature was her communication?",
  "33162": "Why are you wandering about like an outcast?",
  "33163": "But, miss, you will hear one word?",
  "33164": "Does the count know what answer you received?",
  "33165": "Is, then, the woman, who holds out to the bitter end in her desire to have the last word, in so far virtuous?",
  "33166": "Shall we return to the camp?",
  "33167": "Query, ought it not, in strict grammar, to be injecerit, instead of infecit?",
  "33168": "Then you are giving it up?",
  "33169": "And do ye carry your flock bed, and your quilt, and your crock, and your bit of chiney?",
  "33170": "Is there anything else that puzzles you?",
  "33171": "Would you leave our village, desert our homes and fly before an enemy approaches?",
  "33172": "What are you to her?",
  "33173": "I expect you're feeling very 'appy today, sir?",
  "33174": "What could your ladyship propose by it?",
  "33175": "Who, then, has more luck than I have?",
  "33176": "When did they cease to be so?",
  "33177": "And what did you detect, if not gratitude?",
  "33178": "Speak I soothly, men of greenwood?",
  "33179": "Could misunderstanding be more complete, or sympathy worse misplaced?",
  "33180": "But what made her do that?",
  "33181": "But where will he touch?",
  "33182": "Now what will you take?",
  "33183": "Rupert?",
  "33184": "Do you think to overawe us by this?",
  "33185": "Can you understand it?",
  "33186": "That makes in all?",
  "33187": "Where's your leg?",
  "33188": "Or morn or weary even?",

  "33204": "How was that, uncle?",
  "33205": "You don't know how much time the king devotes to eating?",
  "33206": "Laugh?",
  "33207": "Are not these very simple truths?",

  "33228": "What side of oneself does one display in evasions?",
  "33229": "And was it a fine baby?",
  "33230": "What are you stopping here for?",
  "33231": "Can you guess why I did that?",
  "33232": "Or what great danger dwells upon my suit?",
  "33233": "My genus, is that you?",
  "33234": "Would you so fain have her as you pretend?",
  "33235": "What is the good of the ear if it tells you the same as the eye?",
  "33236": "Perhaps you do not wish to accept my proposition?",
  "33237": "And you repent already?",
  "33238": "An answer?",
  "33239": "Come now, that's the great thing?",

  "33244": "Could he, too, write like that, express the melancholy of his soul in verse?",
  "33245": "So the question was, what to do?",
  "33246": "Well enough to question him in that language?",
  "33247": "But what's the meaning of it all?",
  "33248": "Then do you know what I did?",
  "33249": "Might I crave your favour to carry my name to him, and say I beg to say a word in his ear?",
  "33250": "Ah kin you tell wether I've a soul or not?",
  "33251": "What money?",
  "33252": "Is your tobacco perfumed, servant, that you swear by the sweet smoke?",

  "33262": "Next?",
  "33263": "You have heard of my dear father, then?",
  "33264": "What does he want?",

  "33273": "Are you strong enough to face it alone?",
  "33274": "HOW WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT A SUPERFICIES TERMINATES IN A POINT?",
  "33275": "Do you talk of a sacrifice?",
  "33276": "But what was the reason of this indignation?",

  "33278": "Why do you speak of the unhappiness of your father's wife?",
  "33279": "Where is your father's place of business?",
  "33280": "What profits that?",
  "33281": "Hear me, sir?",
  "33282": "Ah, you will tell all I have said, will you not, reverend sir?",

  "33297": "Not play?",
  "33298": "You are not ashamed of the face that has done so much?",
  "33299": "Every word?",
  "33300": "Reproaching you for what?",
  "33301": "Are we not still masters of our own swords?",
  "33302": "Will ye come up here?",
  "33303": "Then why don't you say so, and let the girl put away the things, instead of keeping her waiting all morning?",
  "33304": "And then?",
  "33305": "Do you care for him?",
  "33306": "Do you think that I would tell you a falsehood about it?",
  "33307": "Will that do, or is it too genteel?",
  "33308": "Is there no devil to help me?",
  "33309": "You think it's possible?",
  "33310": "Well, you know what I am here for, don't you?",
  "33311": "The hanging?",

  "33315": "Kiesewetter?",
  "33316": "Was there ever such a blockhead, that can't tell the difference between jest and earnest?",
  "33317": "Don't anybody live there?",
  "33318": "Hope he'll see her?",
  "33319": "Is it, then important?",
  "33320": "Did you really?",
  "33321": "What reason?",
  "33322": "I wonder what's the reason?",
  "33323": "How could they fail to see how they were ruining themselves, lowering their prestige by this appointment?",
  "33324": "And don't you occupy yourself at all?",
  "33325": "Will he continue to give lectures in virtue?",
  "33326": "Why do you flee?",
  "33327": "They ask me, are they to light the candles that have been lighted before or candles that have never been lighted?",
  "33328": "And whose should you say it was?",
  "33329": "On whom did it depend?",
  "33330": "What is it, gentlemen?",
  "33331": "Suppose I refuse?",
  "33332": "Can't ye see the world where you stand?",
  "33333": "That young girl whom they were abducting was not to be brought back?",

  "33350": "What can I do better in the interval between this and the setting of the sun?",
  "33351": "Do personal relations lead to sloppiness in the end?",
  "33352": "And you, being a good man, can pass it as such, and forgive and pity the dreamer, and be lenient and encouraging when he wakes?",
  "33353": "What means the woman?",
  "33354": "Should he descend and make a race for the distant cliffs, or should he hide here until night?",
  "33355": "But what are your intentions?",
  "33356": "Would that make his fortune?",
  "33357": "But about the time when he should drive the cattle homewards, who should he see coming but a great giant with his sword in his hand?",

  "33366": "Do you not see some loophole, some flaw?",
  "33367": "Is it a bitter dose?",
  "33368": "Was it not on my account that she wished to be laid to rest in this place?",
  "33369": "Would you be a porter?",
  "33370": "You won't forget?",
  "33371": "Who is this in whom such beauty is radiant?",
  "33372": "But who was your mother?",
  "33373": "What has she left behind her?",
  "33374": "And democracy has her own good, of which the insatiable desire brings her to dissolution?",

  "33482": "And who stands safest?",
  "33483": "And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't see you?",
  "33484": "Lieutenant?",
  "33485": "A sailor, I believe?",
  "33486": "What was the difference between that gallant that's gone and you, sir?",
  "33487": "Are you quite sure of that?",
  "33488": "How can you bear to speak so lightly?",
  "33489": "It is now my turn to ask you 'why?",

  "33527": "What means this outrage?",
  "33528": "Have you been enjoying yourself?",
  "33529": "And nobody called respecting it?",
  "33530": "When one will have defeated the other, of whom can he complain who has the worst of it?",
  "33531": "Then whom, ARE you talking about?",
  "33532": "You mean that this demands explanation, do you not?",
  "33533": "Can it be a song of joy?",
  "33534": "Did it move, did it float on the surface of the ocean, or did it dive into its depths?",
  "33535": "Reasonable well, I give you thanks, wont you alight?",

  "33537": "Beasts, did you say?",
  "33538": "Who is coming to tea?",
  "33539": "Put an end?",
  "33540": "Won't it strain my joints?",
  "33541": "How can I tell him to be sober when I have been a beast all my life?",
  "33542": "Whence comes this fear, that he should shrink from a lonely girl, feeble and timid, simple and mild?",
  "33543": "If free, would he attempt to fly, or would he remain?",
  "33544": "They're not far from here, then?",
  "33545": "Were you a steward or a stoker in those days?",
  "33546": "Is it true that force and right are necessarily on the same side in republican governments?",
  "33547": "Are you aware how small his means are, and of the straitened circumstances of his widow?",

  "33626": "What am I to say, indoors?",
  "33627": "How did he evolve his ethics?",
  "33628": "Have you seen the thief?",
  "33629": "Do virtuous men, in so far as they are virtuous, stand in each other's light?",
  "33630": "Shall we bathe this morning?",
  "33631": "What's the matter now, ma'am?",
  "33632": "And is no allowance to be made for inadvertence, or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment?",
  "33633": "Or is it actual?",
  "33634": "You'll call when you're ready for your pudding, won't you?",
  "33635": "How does she look?",
  "33636": "Married another?",
  "33637": "Do with him?",
  "33638": "And what may his name be, coptain?",
  "33639": "You might have stayed away, I suppose, if you would?",
  "33640": "Brown, convicted of mutinous conduct and sentenced to death?",
  "33641": "Who will become the sharer of this dangerous secret?",
  "33642": "What is the gift of conquest but safety?",
  "33643": "French, eh?",
  "33644": "Is he too so very remarkable?",
  "33645": "Who do you think is going to be married tomorrow?",
  "33646": "Both, on the other hand, had joined pretty gaily in the conversation, for why should they interrupt it?",
  "33647": "I regulate my watch?",
  "33648": "Do you hear, sir?",
  "33649": "How can girls like to have lovers and refuse them?",
  "33650": "Have you finished tea?",
  "33651": "How he out fins and flops about, and blows like a porpoise properly frightened, don't he?",
  "33652": "What like was she?",
  "33653": "Has anything extraordinary happened to you?",
  "33654": "Who made this gruel here?",
  "33655": "And where are they?",
  "33656": "If you had been born such, would you have been here now?",
  "33657": "But how do you come here?",
  "33658": "But I wonder is it so very nice?",
  "33659": "Did it hurt you much?",
  "33660": "Well, well, he made a mistake, didn't he?",
  "33661": "On what principle, then, shall we any longer choose justice rather than the worst injustice?",
  "33662": "Do you reckon YOU can learn 'em anything?",
  "33663": "What do I read here?",
  "33664": "What woman can before her husband?",
  "33665": "Who has the right to dictate to my conscience, and where did he get that right?",
  "33666": "Is she coming, and open, free?",
  "33667": "By your orders?",
  "33668": "To dig the foundations out from under that cabin with?",
  "33669": "Why, you wouldn't break both their hearts now?",
  "33670": "My dear child, how can I help minding?",
  "33671": "Is this so?",
  "33672": "You'll make up for it by making another?",
  "33673": "Bubbles?",
  "33674": "Are you willing to endure to the last, and not once attempt a repayment?",
  "33675": "What are they, my dear friend?",
  "33676": "What d' you want o' him again?",
  "33677": "I hope you think so?",
  "33678": "But why on earth should it bother him?",
  "33679": "I wonder whether I've done well in advising that amusement?",
  "33680": "Had I?",
  "33681": "Jack?",
  "33682": "What means can I take to introduce it to the world?",
  "33683": "And so it came about that the young rat did see a good deal of the world, but how?",
  "33684": "But they will contest the will after your death?",
  "33685": "Walks by night, does she?",
  "33686": "But there CAN be something else, can't there?",
  "33687": "And who is it to belong to?",
  "33688": "Is that enough?",
  "33689": "What about souls?",
  "33690": "But what have you been doing?",
  "33691": "Do we need common sense and fairness in our regulations?",
  "33692": "Have you let your lodgings, ma'am?",
  "33693": "Ought we to rank this one species with bears, and what should we do with the other species?",
  "33694": "Were you not engaged in it then?",
  "33695": "How do you know that, sir?",
  "33696": "Fond mother, whence these fears?",
  "33697": "Is it conscious?",
  "33698": "What do you know on the subject?",
  "33699": "And what, pray, is your idea of the duties of a devoted friend?",
  "33700": "Who can desire it more than I?",
  "33701": "What would you propose doing?",
  "33702": "What chance have I?",
  "33703": "What were his charms?",
  "33704": "Why should they not work for a uniform minimum of labour conditions through all their communities?",
  "33705": "So he has turned you out?",
  "33706": "Come for long?",
  "33707": "By the way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from?",
  "33708": "Why should he be so mean now?",
  "33709": "After all, I don't funk it, do I?",
  "33710": "Hadn't we better stroll into the park?",
  "33711": "Did ye not care for her?",
  "33712": "DO with it?",
  "33713": "Ask you what provocation I have had?",
  "33714": "Not know the thing which my own eyes beheld?",
  "33715": "Anything else?",
  "33716": "Will you taste for yourself?",
  "33717": "It's not a very nice night to be out, is it?",
  "33718": "You'll come and meet me as usual, girls?",
  "33719": "Now, had I come upon a hopeless incompatibility?",
  "33720": "Do you know what you're doing?",
  "33721": "Quite a vineyard, hey?",
  "33722": "Do I flatter myself if I allow myself to look at it in that way?",
  "33723": "Have I done right?",
  "33724": "He's all right?",
  "33725": "How can I ever thank you for all the deep obligations you impose upon me every day?",
  "33726": "Was there no loophole of escape?",
  "33727": "I suppose we must take the shapes of beasts?",
  "33728": "What are you surprised at?",
  "33729": "What did they matter when he played divinely?",
  "33730": "Tell me the why of this?",
  "33731": "But is it that makes you go?",
  "33732": "Will you graciously let me kiss your hand?",
  "33733": "Who are you to ask me my business?",
  "33734": "But does not this question make a disturbance outside of political circles?",
  "33735": "What influence can I possibly have over a bandit?",
  "33736": "Why don't you make him speak?",
  "33737": "Is there a carriage at the door?",
  "33738": "Do you still wish to do so?",
  "33739": "At all events, what use was there in delaying?",
  "33740": "And what right had she to be cross?",
  "33741": "What's the good, if you're sick with love for him?",
  "33742": "How should you?",
  "33743": "Is that fine, keen edge upon your soul that gives such avidity for holy things?",
  "33744": "What of the resemblance?",
  "33745": "Why a locksmiths' association in a village?",
  "33746": "Or must I fly the country altogether?",
  "33747": "You play cards, don't you?",
  "33748": "What would have been the result?",
  "33749": "Back at last?",
  "33750": "What else could this fragment be but the sole surviving remnant of some sumptuous mansion that once had stood on this unrivaled site?",
  "33751": "Isn't it possible to help them?",
  "33752": "In relation to what objects?",
  "33753": "You WERE afraid?",
  "33754": "Do you think I am deceiving you?",
  "33755": "How can you know what he is?",
  "33756": "What were you eating there all by yourself for your dinner?",
  "33757": "What'll yer give me?",
  "33758": "Are you going to sail in?",
  "33759": "Wonder if you'll ever drag me up there?",
  "33760": "Is there any need to hurry, sir?",
  "33761": "Still I ask you, what is this to me?",
  "33762": "And leave the litter as it is?",
  "33763": "Do you advance with him?",
  "33764": "So perhaps I shall rub on?",
  "33765": "In front or behind?",
  "33766": "And by what authority?",
  "33767": "Yea, what then?",
  "33768": "I really could not say?",
  "33769": "And does he imagine that the coadjutor will put himself out for him?",
  "33770": "Do you think she will ever forget that her son is her safeguard, her shield, the pledge for her dignity, for her fortune and her life?",
  "33771": "You said prince, did you not?",
  "33772": "Are you sure they won't come and search the garret?",
  "33773": "Was it worth it?",
  "33774": "What young ladies?",
  "33775": "Shall we turn back?",
  "33776": "At the end of your name stands for?",
  "33777": "Is it not time to decide finally the meaning of the gift of the great fortune now all in your hand, and growing?",
  "33778": "Well, are we going to stand here all day?",
  "33779": "Have we reached the limits of what reason can supply?",
  "33780": "What should I say?",
  "33781": "What will gladden your heart?",
  "33782": "Are you sure it will be the last time?",
  "33783": "She'll do, won't she?",
  "33784": "What is that for a man to do?",
  "33785": "Since when?",
  "33786": "Why, soldiers, why?",
  "33787": "How came you to read some of those queerer ones?",
  "33788": "Did you not love your husband either?",
  "33789": "Where is true peace or true glory?",
  "33790": "How is it now?",
  "33791": "Durys?",
  "33792": "Don't you want to stop any longer?",
  "33793": "Has the reality of them ever been perceived by you through the bodily organs?",
  "33794": "Which girls should love?",
  "33795": "When was it?",
  "33796": "Does it belong to anybody in the neighbourhood?",
  "33797": "Has anything happened?",
  "33798": "Did you hit her?",
  "33799": "Is there any signal for the general rally?",
  "33800": "About what age is he?",
  "33801": "And why did I come here?",
  "33802": "What mercy can you expect from the man whom you have wronged?",
  "33803": "Have I taken an oath of some sort, then?",
  "33804": "Shall we say, in such a case, that the will of the majority was for the ultimate end?",
  "33805": "Where what?",
  "33806": "You say?",
  "33807": "Do you no longer like to think of your mother?",
  "33808": "What are you doing?",
  "33809": "May I understand, sir, that you threat is withdrawn, and that my income is secure?",
  "33810": "Are the two so deeply separated in this town, that there is no place whatever for an honest workman between them?",
  "33811": "Why then should a man cling to a longer stay here?",
  "33812": "The symptoms are marked, do you see?",
  "33813": "But supposing we had the authority, I would ask what good can result from the examination?",
  "33814": "What am I coming for?",
  "33815": "But settled?",
  "33816": "Did I like his voice?",
  "33817": "How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor?",
  "33818": "Who to?",
  "33819": "And the girl?",
  "33820": "Well, have you had a good hunt, have you botanised successfully?",
  "33821": "And why should you want to spite her?",
  "33822": "What did you pick me up for?",
  "33823": "And what does 'in my name' mean?",
  "33824": "What, are you all got together, like players at the end of the last act?",
  "33825": "Have you ever seen it?",
  "33826": "Isn't it the truth?",
  "33827": "When, then, did father and son exchange shields, and why?",
  "33828": "Would he have been justified in sacrificing his own child, even if he could thereby save another's?",
  "33829": "Why are you only laying one place?",
  "33830": "Loves him?",
  "33831": "Yet who are the folk whom you find HERE?",
  "33832": "Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?",
  "33833": "Who is coming in here?",
  "33834": "What was she going to say, and what reply would she get?",
  "33835": "Can you tell me how to go about getting on the stage?",
  "33836": "What was your idea, then?",
  "33837": "Running from what?",
  "33838": "Valdemar?",
  "33839": "How are you going to manage to get out?",
  "33840": "Have you a portmanteau?",
  "33841": "What does it matter?",
  "33842": "What depth have we now reached?",
  "33843": "Wouldn't you have been rude?",
  "33844": "What the deuse do we men go to school for?",
  "33845": "If it be called swamp or sky?",
  "33846": "Defend ourselves against D'Artagnan?",
  "33847": "How the devil is he so like?",
  "33848": "Once more, will you undertake it?",
  "33849": "Are not these functions proper to the soul, and can they rightly be assigned to any other?",
  "33850": "Was it sheer blind force of passion that would satisfy her now?",
  "33851": "How's this, dear niece?",
  "33852": "Do you know who that was?",
  "33853": "Was SHE at the ball too?",
  "33854": "And what made you ask it of me?",
  "33855": "Do you know that if we should ship, it would serve you quite right?",
  "33856": "Where are your wits?",
  "33857": "Is it possible, dear, that what I hear is true?",
  "33858": "No clue?",
  "33859": "Will you give me as far from the river as you can distinguish the belly of a horse?",
  "33860": "So what if he died, how did this concern the boy?",
  "33861": "Build I in the winds my dwelling?",
  "33862": "And what more free than he that desireth nothing upon earth?",
  "33863": "And you have them?",
  "33864": "But don't you love me, my dear wife, because I have been so pulled down by illness?",
  "33865": "I don't know if you notice it?",
  "33866": "Did I indeed, sir?",
  "33867": "And are greater miracles to be performed by those who do not follow his footsteps, who healed the body to reach the mind?",
  "33868": "And did I say there was any difficulty?",
  "33869": "Have I not got a brave determination of all my doubts, and a response in all things agreeable to the oracle that gave it?",
  "33870": "Could I leave the lady alone?",
  "33871": "Is it really?",
  "33872": "Don't you think I've been extraordinarily good?",
  "33873": "Do you think I'm not sufficiently ruining my health living here amid the continual emanations of the pharmacy?",
  "33874": "What be ye looking at?",
  "33875": "How should she be able to compose herself when she should first see him?",
  "33876": "But tell me, what would you have done?",
  "33877": "Confused?",
  "33878": "Wherefrom do they acquire these tendencies, these peculiarities?",
  "33879": "Who first seduced them to that foul revolt?",
  "33880": "If they want to jump down, now, and get into trouble, who objects?",
  "33881": "Do you regard that meaning as offensive?",
  "33882": "And why does the former operation end exactly when the latter commences?",
  "33883": "What is your notion?",
  "33884": "What now was my plain duty?",
  "33885": "But where can one jump to?",
  "33886": "Isn't he idle?",
  "33887": "And how were they?",
  "33888": "Who told you his name?",
  "33889": "Who and where is he?",
  "33890": "Shall we then raise cuckolds?",
  "33891": "Guess I did, didn't I?",
  "33892": "But that I make no admissions?",
  "33893": "Am I deceived?",
  "33894": "What's the good of daylight now?",
  "33895": "What are the facts?",
  "33896": "Have you nothing to say to us?",
  "33897": "Can you tell when there is a good fire?",
  "33898": "What on earth will she say to me, I wonder?",
  "33899": "Where are thy sisters?",
  "33900": "Did you anticipate the accident which has happened to your granddaughter?",
  "33901": "What cause had you to make discoveries of his pretended passion?",
  "33902": "Elopement?",
  "33903": "How shall I be able to endure life for thirteen years?",
  "33904": "How deeply sir, you apprehend it?",
  "33905": "Cake or bread and butter?",
  "33906": "Or might you have only travelled for your amusement?",
  "33907": "Who has not seen poor birds caught by their feet in the lime?",
  "33908": "I have seen you before, I think?",
  "33909": "Does not the practice of despoiling an enemy afford an excuse for not facing the battle?",
  "33910": "The place is then, as you know, determined on rebellion?",
  "33911": "And was that the upshot of my life's hardest battle?",
  "33912": "When did you shed tears over lost souls?",
  "33913": "And the chief officer?",
  "33914": "Is it not horrible?",
  "33915": "On plantation?",
  "33916": "When you say it that way it sounds comical, does it not?",
  "33917": "What did you do with the girl?",
  "33918": "Who would want to injure us, or damage the projectile?",
  "33919": "How do you distinguish them?",
  "33920": "Haidee, would it please you not to leave me?",
  "33921": "But if they don't do for us, if they're stupid?",
  "33922": "In the name of the ninth day, what manner of creature are you?",
  "33923": "It is then a service which you propose to render us, count?",
  "33924": "Whence comes this charm of the mustache, will you tell me?",
  "33925": "Why a blue coat?",
  "33926": "Are you here for good?",
  "33927": "What was I telling you?",
  "33928": "Snakes?",
  "33929": "May I ask you a question?",
  "33930": "And yet does not your honor fear to compromise yourself by allowing such a sum to be carried away for the service of your enemy?",
  "33931": "Then have we got to part?",
  "33932": "But what do you want to do with these chickens?",
  "33933": "Do you suggest that I should do that to a similarly garbed female?",
  "33934": "And if I do not read it, what shall you do, mamma?",
  "33935": "What is going on here?",
  "33936": "Can I see her first?",
  "33937": "And the profits are large?",
  "33938": "You let him go?",
  "33939": "How can he save them?",
  "33940": "Barkis, do you mean?",
  "33941": "Why don't you like her husband?",
  "33942": "All right, is it?",
  "33943": "I can't help it, can I?",
  "33944": "Is that the sort of fellow?",
  "33945": "And that's all you want?",
  "33946": "Number of what, child?",
  "33947": "Fluffed in his lines, did he?",
  "33948": "But was resistance and, in the last place, victory possible?",
  "33949": "Ought not a son to love his father, whatever happens?",
  "33950": "Why, you wished to have a talk with me when the others left?",
  "33951": "Have you ever heard anything particular respecting his birth?",
  "33952": "But how did we become engaged?",
  "33953": "Did this man belong to the double enigma of order and disorder?",
  "33954": "Then he has travelled?",
  "33955": "Will you not take my word?",
  "33956": "I pray you say, what would you ask?",
  "33957": "What is the name of this obliging youth?",
  "33958": "Don't you see their terrible eyes?",
  "33959": "Have they sentenced you?",
  "33960": "I am the ghost's accomplice?",
  "33961": "You 'eathen, where the mischief 'ave you been?",
  "33962": "And has not this been our own case in the matter of equals and of absolute equality?",
  "33963": "And if I do my duty and do right, you will sustain me, will you not?",
  "33964": "Do not you also?",
  "33965": "His race, his form, his name almost unknown?",
  "33966": "But you will see him yourself?",
  "33967": "'What do you mean?",
  "33968": "How can one talk to the masters like that?",
  "33969": "And yet they say that war is like a game of chess?",
  "33970": "But what does he want of them?",
  "33971": "Is it thy resolve that both shall die?",
  "33972": "But what's your real name?",
  "33973": "Then why did you stay with us, and blast your prospects?",
  "33974": "And the salary?",
  "33975": "Have you heard the news, sir?",
  "33976": "Or to what port are we bound?",
  "33977": "Why, then, is it, when neither law nor justice forbids it, that we are asked to spend our time and money in inquiring into its truth?",
  "33978": "And what will all her learning and her daintiness do for her, now?",
  "33979": "How has this terrible past been recalled?",
  "33980": "Am I to feed upon wisdom like a dog?",
  "33981": "Indeed, why not?",
  "33982": "Could not you, sir, estimate their maximum?",
  "33983": "Is this the fact?",
  "33984": "Barsad?",
  "33985": "I suppose you won't be back before three?",
  "33986": "And our poor cactuses, where are they?",
  "33987": "What muscles he had?",
  "33988": "Why, what do you mean?",
  "33989": "No, but what can I do?",
  "33990": "Have they allowed the headsman to escape?",
  "33991": "Is perseverance a virtue?",
  "33992": "Can you ever forgive me?",
  "33993": "You really think that your solution must be correct?",
  "33994": "You have nothing further to say to me?",
  "33995": "Shall I cut away?",
  "33996": "Has he asked you to be his wife?",
  "33997": "Is thy daughter mine now?",
  "33998": "Now, what's up?",
  "33999": "PISTHETAERUS I?",
  "34000": "Is there anything you dislike in me that you act so contrarily to my wishes?",
  "34001": "Anger?",
  "34002": "Is it not some bad affair?",
  "34003": "Will you do it?",
  "34004": "I wonder how many I shall meet going back?",
  "34005": "Could it be possible that they had escaped?",
  "34006": "Are you SURE you were quite comfortable?",
  "34007": "Had he any weapons?",
  "34008": "Was there no way by which I might have enjoyed in freedom comforts even greater than those which I now earn by servitude?",
  "34009": "What is spirit?",
  "34010": "Ladies, what man's love is there that would stand a year's nursing of the object of his affection?",
  "34011": "How I gwyne to ketch her en I out in de woods?",
  "34012": "Won't you stop all night?",
  "34013": "Then why were you taught to shoot?",
  "34014": "What good comes of it?",
  "34015": "What happened to me?",
  "34016": "What was it that set our two hearts eternally apart and made hope impossible?",
  "34017": "On the contrary, don't I see every reason why I shouldn't?",
  "34018": "The captain?",
  "34019": "Ruinous, why?",
  "34020": "Couldn't you hear the noise?",
  "34021": "Was she really a stenographer?",
  "34022": "Is it possible that he died in the bitter frame of mind he was then in?",

  "34843": "And what is it?",
  "34844": "Won't you have some tea?",
  "34845": "What is love?",
  "34846": "How did it come to pass that their lips met?",
  "34847": "But to what do you attribute this conduct?",
  "34848": "Can it be that any of you tread that soil and forget the great purposes for which those men bravely fought, or nobly died?",
  "34849": "What was the notion?",
  "34850": "I wonder whether I have lost anything really?",
  "34851": "What news have you brought me?",
  "34852": "And had you a great many smart beaux there?",
  "34853": "About what?",
  "34854": "What on earth was I to do?",
  "34855": "What has he in his hand there?",
  "34856": "He said I should object?",

  "34864": "You're fond of him?",
  "34865": "Is not the state the ruler's property?",
  "34866": "I felt a shiver run through me, and I asked 'The schoolmaster?",
  "34867": "He forgot I hadn't heard any of these splendid monologues on, what was it?",
  "34868": "What de matter now, massa?",
  "34869": "Are they both dead?",
  "34870": "What guide had I through the trackless waste of interplanetary space?",
  "34871": "And if the earth fell upon the sun?",

  "34882": "Which way do we head?",
  "34883": "I take it for granted that since dawn every constable within forty miles has been looking out for a wet stranger?",

  "34890": "But would he recognize her?",
  "34891": "Is this all?",
  "34892": "Dogs' heads, eh?",
  "34893": "You think?",
  "34894": "Would you murder me?",
  "34895": "Where can I drive you?",
  "34896": "There, did I do all right?",
  "34897": "Why stay to imbibe this sweet poison that was corroding the very springs of my life?",
  "34898": "Where now shall we seek them?",
  "34899": "Does that astonish you, my boy?",

  "34916": "Was there any possible reason other than the one she gave?",
  "34917": "What am I to write?",
  "34918": "Krook?",
  "34919": "Things for sale, or do you want to sell anything?",
  "34920": "Would the matter be carried as far as that?",
  "34921": "And what does she want the money for?",
  "34922": "Still leading his life of pleasure?",
  "34923": "Has he such might as to defy us all?",
  "34924": "What makes poor scoundrel rogues to beg, I pray you?",
  "34925": "You have nothing more to ask of me, my lord?",
  "34926": "Got a pin and a pencil, some of you?",
  "34927": "Against whom?",
  "34928": "You'll let me tell you, won't you?",
  "34929": "Would you like fine horses, or it may be some one has offended you, and you would like his head?",
  "34930": "Wisdom, virtue, enlightenment?",
  "34931": "And what could they be talking about?",

  "34933": "We may reply, and by what right do you demand payment from us for labor which we did not impose upon you?",
  "34934": "Is it necessary to change my frock?",
  "34935": "Do you confess that you were a wicked traitor?",
  "34936": "Didn't find anything, eh?",
  "34937": "Then why didn't you say so at first?",
  "34938": "When did it take place?",
  "34939": "So how was the dog killed?",
  "34940": "And, of course, the horse and cart were ready?",
  "34941": "For who but the rich of this world can thus afford to fling pearls away?",
  "34942": "Suppose you catch it?",
  "34943": "Pip why don't you take me into your life?",
  "34944": "And be merry?",
  "34945": "What are you about?",
  "34946": "What else?",
  "34947": "What's his name and address?",
  "34948": "How many times did he call upon his father?",

  "34950": "Seeing then that the immortal is indestructible, must not the soul, if she is immortal, be also imperishable?",
  "34951": "Now, at once?",
  "34952": "Are we saved?",
  "34953": "Of what consequence to science is this interminable recital of crude facts, if your analysis never extracts a single idea from them?",
  "34954": "What, my dear, are you talking about?",
  "34955": "After all, who had seen him?",
  "34956": "From such beginning of governments, what could be expected but a continued system of war and extortion?",
  "34957": "And how much did they possess?",
  "34958": "Does he limit it to the few who did him the wrong, or does he take in the many?",
  "34959": "But why should I tell you all this?",
  "34960": "Well, isn't he a nasty man to get into such staggers at a morning wake?",
  "34961": "Do you think I will not listen to you?",
  "34962": "On what road, master?",
  "34963": "Why can't they let a girl marry three men, or as many as want her, and save all this trouble?",
  "34964": "My dear friend, of what consequence is it if she kills me?",
  "34965": "What link could there be between that creature and my wife?",
  "34966": "And do you think she is not there?",
  "34967": "The law?",
  "34968": "Will you go directly?",
  "34969": "Can it be that there remains to us only the recollection of them?",
  "34970": "Won't that be better than moping here?",
  "34971": "Not even if they were kind to you?",
  "34972": "And who will help you?",
  "34973": "And were these four men attached to each other, true in heart, really united?",
  "34974": "Have you let it?",
  "34975": "Why does the soul still tarry in my body?",
  "34976": "Who has ever heard of such a marvelous place?",
  "34977": "But in heaven's name, tell me, what was that?",
  "34978": "Where did you hear it?",
  "34979": "Do you see?",
  "34980": "And now, prisoner, will you consent to tell your name?",
  "34981": "Is he accompanied?",
  "34982": "Yes, but how?",
  "34983": "What weight can my blood add to the wool?",
  "34984": "How did he die?",
  "34985": "Says I, father, what on airth are you at?",
  "34986": "May not this prove dangerous?",
  "34987": "How is it all the better?",
  "34988": "Won't I tell mama?",
  "34989": "Don't tell me that she helped to set a trap for me?",
  "34990": "What dreadful thing will you do next?",
  "34991": "Is your wife at home?",
  "34992": "How did your tribute arise?",
  "34993": "Well, what are you doing here, and what is your name?",
  "34994": "Why shouldn't I marry her?",
  "34995": "What are you in such a hurry for?",
  "34996": "If you know my heart, then, can you not see that it is my heart I offer you?",
  "34997": "And yet how could it possibly be so?",
  "34998": "Well, are you so sure of the little gentleman?",
  "34999": "Was it you, sir?",
  "35000": "Have you noticed anything amiss with them of late?",
  "35001": "What purpose?",
  "35002": "What possessed him to do it?",
  "35003": "Or would you like another?",
  "35004": "You should sin less, and keep better in health?",
  "35005": "What advantage would it be to me to be anything else?",
  "35006": "Has your brother or the cat been meddling?",
  "35007": "Secondly, what are the best means, and the least expensive, for accomplishing those ends?",
  "35008": "Well, tell me, I have always wanted to know, did it hurt worse going in or coming out?",
  "35009": "Will I have eyes at the bottom of the sea, supposing I descend those endless stairs?",
  "35010": "You aren't angry?",
  "35011": "Do you understand it at last?",
  "35012": "Now you quit it, do you hear?",
  "35013": "What is to be done now?",
  "35014": "Has she slept through it?",
  "35015": "Was there any idea at all connected with it?",
  "35016": "Is this the man?",
  "35017": "You will take something or other, surely?",
  "35018": "Did you stop there?",
  "35019": "And where did you get so much money?",
  "35020": "But they'll recognize you?",
  "35021": "He made grandfather's coffin, didn't he?",
  "35022": "Have you any message?",
  "35023": "May I come out to you in the garden presently?",
  "35024": "Where has she gone?",
  "35025": "But what's the idea of your new picture?",
  "35026": "Why had he not known the difference between the political value and the imaginative value of these things?",
  "35027": "But would it not be salutary to give also the means of preventing their commission?",
  "35028": "Have all gentlemen's servants warts upon their noses, mother?",
  "35029": "Bene curasti hoc jumentam?",
  "35030": "Und you acknowledge tat you pe te blind dronk and te vool ?",
  "35031": "Who was right then?",
  "35032": "Don't you want to see your friends?",
  "35033": "Don't you feel well?",
  "35034": "Why to me?",
  "35035": "Did you see what a fool he looked?",
  "35036": "Have there not been enough killed?",
  "35037": "Perhaps a dodge?",
  "35038": "What is it for?",
  "35039": "Cannot you stay a few minutes longer?",
  "35040": "Do you refuse this lady's hand whom I now offer you?",
  "35041": "Where are you going there?",
  "35042": "Your lordship will recall inquiring of me on the night of the ball as to the bona fides of one of the temporary waiters?",
  "35043": "Would you set a cloud to chase the wind?",
  "35044": "The strength one can eke from little, who knows till he has been subjected to the trial?",
  "35045": "Would you, my reader, like to be more gentle in your manner?",
  "35046": "You had your portfolio with you, then?",
  "35047": "What is the good of repentance like that?",
  "35048": "What are ye for?",
  "35049": "They are laying supper over there, are they?",
  "35050": "You have some in the house, have you not?",
  "35051": "Am I master of the house?",
  "35052": "Did he then love the rhythmic rise and fall of words better than their associations of legend and colour?",
  "35053": "Is not the most important problem that of getting the right man at the head of the company?",
  "35054": "Now, then, who can point out any sinless person in the present world?",
  "35055": "That was really what we meant, wasn't it?",
  "35056": "You are in love?",
  "35057": "WHAT IS IT?",
  "35058": "Shall I love all men, then, for the sake of one?",
  "35059": "Need I say de more?",
  "35060": "How can they, he said, when they are not allowed to apply their minds to the callings of any of these?",
  "35061": "Are you really not to be persuaded, even now, to pass the night under my roof?",
  "35062": "What for, then?",
  "35063": "Is my husband's political career likely to suffer through this incident?",
  "35064": "Besides, where were these poor girls to go?",
  "35065": "Do you really think so?",
  "35066": "Say, that fits like a T, don't it?",
  "35067": "About what am I now employing my own soul?",
  "35068": "Do you speak by way of offence, sir?",
  "35069": "Why did you name them all with the same name?",
  "35070": "Well, I ask, what can the intervention of power, with the assistance of civil law and political economy, accomplish here?",
  "35071": "A bottle, perhaps?",
  "35072": "What do you expect to do in the midst of this darkness?",
  "35073": "You wouldn't mind that?",
  "35074": "And did she not even go to him?",
  "35075": "What other forces were arrayed?",
  "35076": "And why do they worry me so?",
  "35077": "Young men are all very well in their place, but it doesn't do to drag them into everything, does it?",
  "35078": "What becomes, then, of the doctrine of expiation and abstinence, the morality of sacrifice, resignation, and happy moderation?",

  "35081": "What is this rubbish?",
  "35082": "Don't you know?",
  "35083": "What is he doing there?",
  "35084": "Suicide?",
  "35085": "Her name and family?",
  "35086": "What knave is this?",
  "35087": "But what did I know?",
  "35088": "Had he reached the point of forgetting the mayor's presence?",
  "35089": "Three?",
  "35090": "How could she do it, how can it be possible that she is a woman like that?",
  "35091": "Can we find any such connection in the case of a public work executed by a government?",
  "35092": "What sort of an entertainment, captain?",
  "35093": "How did he make it enter in?",
  "35094": "Whence, comrade?",
  "35095": "What do you reckon did it, boys?",
  "35096": "How do you help it?",
  "35097": "Is it not truly to clothe the naked, to procure for them a garment of light, a raiment of glory?",
  "35098": "Just give me one of those roses in the bunch you are wearing, will you?",
  "35099": "Harrison?",
  "35100": "Unless indeed you know me, and have some purpose in your brain?",
  "35101": "Is he conscious?",
  "35102": "Had his forms of expression changed, or his sentiments become less laudable?",
  "35103": "But what is it you wish?",
  "35104": "Why notice it?",
  "35105": "Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?",
  "35106": "On what charge?",
  "35107": "Is he not a handsome lad?",
  "35108": "Haue you hope of life?",
  "35109": "What is the remedy?",

  "35124": "Shall I fetch you another cup?",
  "35125": "How's that for high living?",
  "35126": "Then for what reason did he call me son?",
  "35127": "And why do you keep following me about?",
  "35128": "Is it worth while to keep an army to protect you in writing proclamations, or to get once a year into winter quarters?",
  "35129": "Well, what's to be done?",
  "35130": "You mean you'll join us?",
  "35131": "Why don't you tell me what's the matter with you?",
  "35132": "Have you given this man work before?",
  "35133": "In the way, you mean, of living with US?",
  "35134": "Is he from home?",
  "35135": "Is there a house in the neighborhood?",
  "35136": "What were you doing on that armchair?",
  "35137": "What say my other friends?",
  "35138": "Some one?",

  "35140": "But why should you have been anxious?",
  "35141": "What size do you want to be?",
  "35142": "Now, is there any sense in these things?",
  "35143": "What manner of man is he?",
  "35144": "Don't you think it's rather a good idea?",
  "35145": "I might let that to you, for what matters it to me?",
  "35146": "What was the opinion?",
  "35147": "Whence comes this to pass, my masters?",
  "35148": "Nothing to you?",
  "35149": "Won't you be mine?",
  "35150": "I suppose you have had dinner?",
  "35151": "Where in the word did you acquire such a voluminous vocabulary?",
  "35152": "And what if other benefits were gained by peace?",
  "35153": "What is it, father?",
  "35154": "That wasn't wrong, was it?",
  "35155": "What did you tell him?",
  "35156": "From the cardinal?",
  "35157": "Is it far from here, sir?",
  "35158": "Do you mean to say you don't know where?",
  "35159": "When was he married?",
  "35160": "Don't you dread the attitude that insensibly arises out of legal obligation?",
  "35161": "And you don't want to go again to night?",
  "35162": "Was she beautiful?",
  "35163": "You're staying the night, I hope?",
  "35164": "Come now, where has this great commander of yours shown his skill?",
  "35165": "What would I want wedding so young?",
  "35166": "What IOU's?",
  "35167": "Do you know anything?",

  "35169": "Isn't he charming?",
  "35170": "Whither so soon?",
  "35171": "Hain't you never seen him?",
  "35172": "Did you find no trace of him?",
  "35173": "The sovereigns?",
  "35174": "A physician?",
  "35175": "Where ought I be, then?",
  "35176": "Who said that she was to belong to you?",
  "35177": "Wouldn't you go a day's journey, if you were in my place?",
  "35178": "In this place?",
  "35179": "I said 'people,' didn't I?",
  "35180": "You mean it is a little dry, perhaps?",
  "35181": "You are not touched even by that danger?",
  "35182": "Then this racket they are making is on account of it, I suppose?",
  "35183": "For what is he in prison then?",
  "35184": "Would exasperation, however, if relief had longer been postponed, finally have betrayed me?",
  "35185": "What did I mean by asking questions?",
  "35186": "Will you dance with me?",
  "35187": "Can you dive?",
  "35188": "More rabbits?",
  "35189": "For this?",
  "35190": "Was there any connection between the commotion of the atmosphere and that of the interior of the earth?",
  "35191": "Has your master come?",
  "35192": "A merry going forth bringeth often a sorrowful return, and a merry evening maketh a sad morning?",

  "35194": "When did you enter the room?",
  "35195": "Whom have I to live for?",
  "35196": "And how about the savages?",
  "35197": "Going to lose her?",
  "35198": "For such matters?",
  "35199": "And do you object to going through the village?",
  "35200": "What do you think of that figure there?",
  "35201": "To how many people can any one tell all?",
  "35202": "Could a body hypocritically take there a small hypocritical touch?",
  "35203": "How have they made me a victim?",
  "35204": "But where can he be?",
  "35205": "How am I?",
  "35206": "And what did she say?",
  "35207": "What could he have done to me?",
  "35208": "Do you take us for thieves?",

  "35212": "Theramenes?",
  "35213": "France?",
  "35214": "Tell me, my dear sir, do you admit the existence of volcanoes on the moon's surface?",
  "35215": "What could be the meaning of his sudden change toward me?",
  "35216": "He warned you to abandon your visit?",
  "35217": "Did you really come to propose to me?",
  "35218": "And then, you ungrateful being, you are not pleased to see an old friend?",
  "35219": "Will you return to this gang of robbers, and to this man, when a word can save you?",
  "35220": "Because of the money?",
  "35221": "Who could place my feet on the right path, and bring me back to my company?",

  "35489": "So you go back from your promise?",
  "35490": "May she?",
  "35491": "Do you remember what I said when you asked me what I should do if I won all the pots I set my heart on and came through alive?",
  "35492": "Is it too great?",
  "35493": "At it again, hey?",

  "36495": "Will you three months hence be in a situation to perform the journey more at your ease than at present?",
  "36496": "But is that case could I have expected more from him than from my own brother?",
  "36497": "You say that I am safe and sound?",
  "36498": "How can one think of him as bad?",
  "36499": "How much might that be?",
  "36500": "Is not 'loves' the truer tense?",

  "36541": "The night porter saw nothing, I suppose?",
  "36542": "For who can guess?",
  "36543": "But shan't you then so much as miss her a little?",
  "36544": "And so you think that I ought to answer your indictment as if I were in a court?",
  "36545": "What need they?",

  "36591": "You have a chart, haven't you?",
  "36592": "Why should he come again?",
  "36593": "What sort of a figure would he make if he escaped?",
  "36594": "Can it be possible?",

  "36712": "Had we a river, a lake, a sea to depend upon?",
  "36713": "But nobody possesses it, so what would you have?",
  "36714": "You have made it up?",
  "36715": "When is it to be done?",
  "36716": "How, then, could they provide for themselves, and when had they time to plough and sow their fields?",
  "36717": "Was her husband, to whom it legally belonged, to make it over to her as a free gift?",
  "36718": "Is what you hear at church, religion?",
  "36719": "And what enlargement do you expect to obtain in this way?",

  "36726": "But won't they know we're not?",
  "36727": "Or you, my lords, to be my followers?",
  "36728": "It is true?",
  "36729": "Then in time of peace justice will be of no use?",
  "36730": "But how could you guess what the motive was?",
  "36731": "What did you think of that?",
  "36732": "When will you come?",
  "36733": "Is it possible, then, to love, if you are not loved?",
  "36734": "Will you be her servants?",
  "36735": "Would she never issue from it?",
  "36736": "There's nothing wrong?",
  "36737": "NOT a party in anything, ma'am?",
  "36738": "Then what?",
  "36739": "Supper?",
  "36740": "Can anyone do much for anyone else unless by making a will in his favour and dying then and there?",
  "36741": "Did we not leave her, but just now?",
  "36742": "Then?",
  "36743": "Has anything worried you?",
  "36744": "And who shall then stick closest to ye, and excite others?",
  "36745": "Can I rely upon you?",
  "36746": "Kill the women?",
  "36747": "Oh, you are the young feller who did that poster?",
  "36748": "I suppose you don't even know what a prig is?",
  "36749": "Don't you wish for anything else?",
  "36750": "Do you know of any houses?",
  "36751": "Do you mean to say that this slip of paper will help us?",
  "36752": "What identity?",
  "36753": "Did you bring the things I mentioned?",
  "36754": "But, my lord, if there be no secret of penitence, will the director consent to my being here?",
  "36755": "Do you have a faith, or a knowledge, you follow, which helps you to live and to do right?",
  "36756": "Is not this what we would have all men do to us?",
  "36757": "Well, there wasn't anything else for her to do, was there?",
  "36758": "You hussy, how dare you talk in that way?",
  "36759": "Now, what shall we do?",
  "36760": "Which should it be?",
  "36761": "Will you follow me?",
  "36762": "What else can I do?",
  "36763": "How would you like to come into a house and find everyone muttering to themselves?",
  "36764": "And can the just by justice make men unjust, or speaking general can the good by virtue make them bad?",
  "36765": "You're sure?",
  "36766": "Prime, isn't it?",
  "36767": "Are we to see profound wisdom in this?",
  "36768": "Is it not, said she, whispering her husband in his ear, is it not a noble nose?",
  "36769": "Who'll keep THEM quiet?",
  "36770": "Had any difference arisen between him and her papa?",
  "36771": "And what shall I?",
  "36772": "Not so much so?",
  "36773": "You are fond of it?",
  "36774": "May I see it?",
  "36775": "Tell me, do you know what the countess, for whose pardon you are beseeching me, has done?",
  "36776": "Had she not openly avowed her intention of marrying for money if she ever had the chance?",
  "36777": "That the boy may sink and perish?",
  "36778": "Whose there?",
  "36779": "Been there long?",
  "36780": "Which is the way?",
  "36781": "Or his starch'd beard?",
  "36782": "Who knows what may be in store for you yet?",
  "36783": "By this?",
  "36784": "And not long?",
  "36785": "Is that certain?",
  "36786": "Isn't it well drawn?",
  "36787": "Are you asleep?",
  "36788": "Any ideas?",
  "36789": "Have we been deceived by an illusion?",
  "36790": "Was it physical?",
  "36791": "Caution?",
  "36792": "Did not you know that, my dear lord?",
  "36793": "Did not your friend here look like me?",
  "36794": "What are you rattling in there?",
  "36795": "But again, will they tell us that such a nature, placed under favourable circumstances, will not be perfectly good and wise if any ever was?",

  "36797": "What happened to the worthy captain?",
  "36798": "And what does the judge affirm to be the life which is next, and the pleasure which is next?",
  "36799": "Was my uncle stark mad?",
  "36800": "You didn't think it could be so bad?",
  "36801": "You mean she won't mind?",
  "36802": "Or have we found angels in the forms of kings to govern him?",
  "36803": "More in your brains than in your pocket, eh?",
  "36804": "He has come, then, as they told me?",
  "36805": "The only unofficial detective?",
  "36806": "Have you had lunch yet?",
  "36807": "Far from here?",
  "36808": "Whither is it carrying me?",
  "36809": "And where are they looking for her?",
  "36810": "Can't you see that I'm as hoarse as a crow?",
  "36811": "But where is your master?",
  "36812": "Who told you this?",
  "36813": "Of what was he thinking?",
  "36814": "Do you think it is too much?",
  "36815": "D'you remember you were rather sniffy about meeting him?",
  "36816": "Is that what you wished to say?",
  "36817": "How much of the ballast of conservatism and of loyalty to tradition is it well to throw overboard in the interest of accelerated motion?",
  "36818": "Shall a similar end be pursued for the ethical purpose of widening the circle of those who shall live and be happy?",
  "36819": "Why have they not seized me?",
  "36820": "When did it happen and what has happened?",
  "36821": "You see?",
  "36822": "How could we like a people who treated us so unjustly?",
  "36823": "When shall the day come when we shall lift our hands?",
  "36824": "Are you then making a thesis?",
  "36825": "Would you like me to bring some rice?",
  "36826": "Who do you want?",
  "36827": "How did he get 'em?",
  "36828": "You wouldn't leave him lying maimed at the bottom of this dreadful place, a moment, if you could bring help to him?",
  "36829": "And is my life to be forfeit, is some terrible punishment to come on my poor old head for that which I cannot help?",
  "36830": "You will be frank with me?",
  "36831": "And was that the head and front of his offending?",
  "36832": "And must he not be represented as such?",
  "36833": "Yes, don't you wish you knew what that card was?",
  "36834": "But what's he doing here?",
  "36835": "He said nothing more?",
  "36836": "And even if he has done wrong, how do I know that he has not condemned himself?",
  "36837": "And do they give you frogs to eat, so's to make you limber?",
  "36838": "A doctor?",
  "36839": "What did you do?",
  "36840": "Would he allow imitation to be the ruling principle of his life, as if he had nothing higher in him?",
  "36841": "Wasn't it rather sudden?",
  "36842": "That's what you tell this gentleman too, is it?",
  "36843": "He's your husband, eh?",
  "36844": "Can I spare him?",
  "36845": "What now?",
  "36846": "Armed?",
  "36847": "Or may not all three be properly allotted to it?",
  "36848": "Anything up?",
  "36849": "Is that so?",
  "36850": "You do not wish to hear it, perhaps?",
  "36851": "What does it matter to me?",
  "36852": "And will not a true astronomer have the same feeling when he looks at the movements of the stars?",
  "36853": "Why, what else are they?",
  "36854": "And s'pose he steps in here any minute, and sings out my name before I can throw him a wink to keep quiet?",
  "36855": "And the just is the good?",
  "36856": "How have I deviated from those principles, monsieur?",
  "36857": "But why FOUR pounds?",
  "36858": "And what did you find?",
  "36859": "What has he come here for?",
  "36860": "Are you inside?",
  "36861": "Downright?",
  "36862": "Do you think she'll miss you?",
  "36863": "Speak I sooth, my masters?",
  "36864": "Why was it necessary to weave the queen into this gloomy web of guilt and crime?",
  "36865": "I suppose that is why you live in town?",
  "36866": "What was the result of that memorable expedition?",
  "36867": "What, then, is the defence?",
  "36868": "What do you mean by risk?",
  "36869": "What would be the use?",
  "36870": "How could she make such nails work?",
  "36871": "Am I not the wife of my husband?",
  "36872": "What came after?",
  "36873": "What is the proposition?",
  "36874": "So?",
  "36875": "How is the snatchblatch?",
  "36876": "Just?",
  "36877": "Did you hear anything of it when you were in those parts?",
  "36878": "What is in this?",
  "36879": "And through what deplorable madness had she thus ruined her life by continual sacrifices?",
  "36880": "Where are the marks of its fangs?",
  "36881": "What d'you say to having something to eat?",
  "36882": "Who was this novice in war with the effrontery of a luminary?",
  "36883": "In my precinct?",
  "36884": "Is she, my lord?",
  "36885": "May this young lady go with us?",
  "36886": "Has no one come to seek her in this land?",
  "36887": "Hadn't we better hear it tomorrow?",
  "36888": "Then you'll be free?",
  "36889": "Monseigneur?",
  "36890": "Is it not sad?",
  "36891": "Can people enchant each other too much, cajole each other too much, charm each other too much?",
  "36892": "Why do they grease the axles of the wheels?",
  "36893": "If there be doubt as to which of our divisions will get our candidate, is there no doubt as to which of your candidates will get your party?",
  "36894": "What did you take me to your mother for?",
  "36895": "And did they ask you to make a speech?",
  "36896": "Don't you see it is hard enough for her already?",
  "36897": "Some such object it was, that induced you to call on me?",
  "36898": "But how about money?",
  "36899": "You here at this hour?",
  "36900": "Well, then, was it this eye or that through which you dropped the beetle?",
  "36901": "What did your excellency say?",
  "36902": "Where are you going, you rascal?",
  "36903": "Do you know, my friends, what that plain, seen from the height we are at, resembles?",
  "36904": "What was the good of bringing him?",
  "36905": "Where was it?",
  "36906": "Would she be decent to him, or would she scold him?",
  "36907": "Which is the best wish to wish him?",
  "36908": "How CAN you say 'I am happier,' and nothing changed?",
  "36909": "Why sadden the poor children, and damp their newly cherished hopes?",
  "36910": "And you feel convinced that you must break with him?",
  "36911": "Alone, where?",
  "36912": "And you saw him frequently?",
  "36913": "Why is she so glad?",
  "36914": "But why do you ask?",
  "36915": "What new treasures lay here for science to unfold?",
  "36916": "What do ye want?",
  "36917": "Rochester?",
  "36918": "What's coming on?",
  "36919": "Are we to wonder, then, if here and there we find in his works an offensive expression?",
  "36920": "Why not cut it?",
  "36921": "What does the letter mean, mother?",
  "36922": "Are we rising into a fiery furnace?",
  "36923": "What substances will you proscribe?",
  "36924": "And what method of surveillance do you employ?",
  "36925": "Oh, well, as it were, what?",
  "36926": "You think so?",
  "36927": "Of how much?",
  "36928": "But we could not prevent it, could we?",
  "36929": "You get your percentage out o' the purchase, I suppose?",
  "36930": "Food enough for all?",
  "36931": "Why doesn't she want it now?",
  "36932": "On the other hand, would he not, by remaining to meet a fate almost inevitable, incur the guilt of suicide?",
  "36933": "Has she told you she likes me much?",
  "36934": "Why should I envy them?",
  "36935": "What did he say to you?",
  "36936": "But if he were taken back again he would imagine, and truly imagine, that he was descending?",
  "36937": "My friend, my friend, why thus grieve me?",
  "36938": "How does that strike you?",
  "36939": "Forty pounds?",
  "36940": "You'll have to, then, won't you?",
  "36941": "But I mean another piece?",
  "36942": "Are all voters enlightened?",
  "36943": "And his level, whether higher or lower, could it possibly be the same as hers?",
  "36944": "What makes you so sure?",
  "36945": "What is it in the nature of the oak that causes it to send its root down into the soil and to drink up of its substance?",
  "36946": "What's he going to read?",
  "36947": "Where shall I go?",
  "36948": "What was the primitive tissue?",
  "36949": "How much do you pay a week?",
  "36950": "Why shouldn't I conscientiously?",
  "36951": "And he is named?",
  "36952": "How came you by the knowledge?",
  "36953": "Is it not one part of honesty to be dutiful and grateful to your master, do you think?",
  "36954": "Why not win to freedom?",
  "36955": "Does he?",
  "36956": "And if not in the worst, why is it to follow at all?",
  "36957": "What, pray?",
  "36958": "Wherefore?",
  "36959": "Shall I be that?",
  "36960": "And what shall we say of such things as religious duties, of cheerfulness, of good manners, of personal cleanliness?",
  "36961": "Or, have you been a bad steward to yourself, and wasted your property in lawsuits and the like?",
  "36962": "Ah, who put it up?",
  "36963": "But light?",
  "36964": "What has opened her eyes?",
  "36965": "Do you want him?",
  "36966": "And would you indeed damn your precious soul?",
  "36967": "Well, did you see her safely off?",
  "36968": "But is he engaged to her?",
  "36969": "Why, how are all the folks at home?",
  "36970": "Are these persons, then, so rich and powerful?",
  "36971": "Can it give heat to a dead body?",
  "36972": "Don't you think so?",
  "36973": "Where's the use of looking nice, when no one sees me but those cross midgets, and no one cares whether I'm pretty or not?",
  "36974": "And the king has seen the cardinal?",
  "36975": "Detain him?",
  "36976": "And return to life, if there be such a thing, is the birth of the dead into the world of the living?",
  "36977": "Or do you also hate the duke your husband?",
  "36978": "Do you know who it is from?",
  "36979": "Have you been to the opera?",
  "36980": "Not a word to your loving mother, who was growing older too?",
  "36981": "Would you be at ease, and feel that you had played an open part?",
  "36982": "Has your majesty no other orders to give me?",
  "36983": "But what are you going to do with him, now he is alive?",
  "36984": "And what shall I do when papa and you leave me, and I am by myself?",
  "36985": "Why is he sleeping there?",
  "36986": "Had he not told her, yes, told her to make a list, and not to admit anyone who was not on that list?",
  "36987": "Were her fears realized?",
  "36988": "I suppose it bowled the poor blighter over absolutely?",
  "36989": "Who introduced this innovation?",
  "36990": "You are perhaps a tulip fancier?",
  "36991": "May I go in and look?",
  "36992": "When will we be married?",
  "36993": "You're in the habit of shaking hands?",
  "36994": "And which is wise and which is foolish?",
  "36995": "But then he had the woman he loved still remaining?",
  "36996": "Shall I then?",
  "36997": "All ready forward?",
  "36998": "Is there any one here?",
  "36999": "But can such a head be found?",
  "37000": "And ten?",
  "37001": "Do you think if I drink water it would take off this hiccup?",
  "37002": "And this one opposite, who is this?",
  "37003": "Neither may they imitate smiths or other artificers, or oarsmen, or boatswains, or the like?",
  "37004": "You'll be ready this day week, will you?",
  "37005": "What was become of them?",
  "37006": "Shall we gather strength but irresolution and inaction?",
  "37007": "And what was in the sealed iron chest?",
  "37008": "Shall I put a little more tea in the pot afore I go, ma'am?",
  "37009": "And what can you conceive more deadly?",
  "37010": "Why did you do it?",
  "37011": "What does she want?",
  "37012": "How do you know about it, and who are you, anyhow?",
  "37013": "What next?",
  "37014": "Deserted?",
  "37015": "When did you get in?",
  "37016": "Will it hit us?",
  "37017": "Do you want to be doing the same?",
  "37018": "Who will bring us bread?",
  "37019": "My friend, what do you tell me?",
  "37020": "Their whistle?",
  "37021": "Where in the world did you get that song?",
  "37022": "Is he very clever?",
  "37023": "Fine stepper, wasn't she?",
  "37024": "Who did I get the statues from?",
  "37025": "Will you have some whiskey and water?",
  "37026": "What news?",
  "37027": "Struck me?",
  "37028": "And you are up?",
  "37029": "What point?",
  "37030": "Don't you know me?",
  "37031": "What is the use of one horse for us two?",
  "37032": "The cardinal was your protector?",
  "37033": "Isn't it splendid to be that kind, teacher?",
  "37034": "Are the other camels better or worse than that?",
  "37035": "Isn't what they have done already enough?",
  "37036": "What two lines?",
  "37037": "At twenty minutes to nine?",
  "37038": "Whom have I to love?",
  "37039": "And the rocks with their various strata?",
  "37040": "Did I not say right?",
  "37041": "What could he, an old man, do?",
  "37042": "And now what does he do?",
  "37043": "Is he so?",
  "37044": "Can't you comprehend that an affection may be genuine as felt by the man, yet its nature be spurious in relation to others?",
  "37045": "Then, at all events, he DID sleep here, did he?",
  "37046": "My name?",
  "37047": "And why should I not?",
  "37048": "How could I escape from this situation?",
  "37049": "Don't you know what it means to me?",
  "37050": "Which was the more important, which the less important part?",
  "37051": "You call them that, too?",
  "37052": "But by what means?",
  "37053": "Not come yet?",
  "37054": "Ever hear of lones the packer, hey, ole chappie?",
  "37055": "Is it quite original?",
  "37056": "Did he do that?",
  "37057": "Why should he trust himself to a balloon, that would blaze up like a piece of paper?",
  "37058": "Now, an't it?",
  "37059": "And don't I suppose his was the first face she saw, as she passed through the storm and the night to that waiting, beautiful place?",
  "37060": "You saw it?",
  "37061": "Like him?",
  "37062": "Would you take a seat, sir?",
  "37063": "And yet what else am I to do?",
  "37064": "Well, have you heard from your husband lately, my dear?",
  "37065": "You refused him?",
  "37066": "How did you know that?",
  "37067": "Can she make your real flecky paste, as melts in your mouth, and lies all up like a puff?",
  "37068": "Whence comes this?",
  "37069": "Yes, what is it?",
  "37070": "Should he stay at home with her, her mother and her sisters?",
  "37071": "What can I do to prevent it?",
  "37072": "Have been brought together, eh?",
  "37073": "Would you like to come up and see her?",
  "37074": "What would you like to do tomorrow?",
  "37075": "Will that arrangement suit you?",
  "37076": "And you shall be included in it, in our happiness, do you hear, father?",
  "37077": "FLOATED?",
  "37078": "Have you eaten anything?",
  "37079": "How d'you know I want to travel?",
  "37080": "Did she feel as he did?",
  "37081": "Water to drink?",
  "37082": "You will not serve me, sir, will you?",
  "37083": "How should he be?",
  "37084": "Again, has he greater experience of the pleasures of honour, or the lover of honour of the pleasures of wisdom?",
  "37085": "Is it nothing to hold one's peace?",
  "37086": "And you can do nothing until then?",
  "37087": "When, where?",
  "37088": "Is there generally?",
  "37089": "Yes, but still all this has to be looked after, and who is there to look after it?",
  "37090": "You a chief, eh?",
  "37091": "How much will you give me for it?",
  "37092": "What have I to say to them?",
  "37093": "Now what do you think on't, neighbour, my friend?",
  "37094": "When are you coming back?",
  "37095": "Can anyone be surprised if one gets fond of such a ship?",
  "37096": "Oh, not her?",
  "37097": "But what is worship?",
  "37098": "Why do you not speak to me?",
  "37099": "In arms against me?",
  "37100": "Do you wish for a proof?",
  "37101": "I can't say more than that, can I?",
  "37102": "Where, then?",
  "37103": "Prove?",
  "37104": "Little woman?",
  "37105": "Shall it be said, good reader?",
  "37106": "Are you glad to leave us, dear?",
  "37107": "What had that harsh tyrant of hers done that was good or serviceable for her?",
  "37108": "And the mistress?",
  "37109": "Can one be well while suffering morally?",
  "37110": "Where would be that thrill if I had been as definite as a timetable?",
  "37111": "How long otherwise?",
  "37112": "Tony, where are you going, my charmer?",
  "37113": "What does this tell us?",
  "37114": "How does she use you?",
  "37115": "Have you nothing else to ask him, sir?",
  "37116": "In the nick of time?",
  "37117": "How?",
  "37118": "Mind it?",
  "37119": "How can I help myself?",
  "37120": "Where has he gone?",
  "37121": "That visit not succeeding either, you will go again perhaps?",
  "37122": "Husband, are you as kind and gentle toward your wife as you should be?",
  "37123": "For what is death?",
  "37124": "If I see, clearly see, that ladder leading from plant to man, why should I suppose it breaks off at me and does not go farther and farther?",
  "37125": "Lively?",
  "37126": "Another glass?",
  "37127": "But the great point is, is there a 'Rita' on the list?",
  "37128": "Don't you hear?",
  "37129": "What was the difference whether the alms were given into my hands or into my wife's?",
  "37130": "Do you tell me that the woman is dead?",
  "37131": "Did he take that medicine, men?",
  "37132": "Who would suppose it?",
  "37133": "When was that done which settled the matter?",
  "37134": "What did you say, sir?",
  "37135": "Well and what am I to do now?",
  "37136": "I couldn't do anything better for her than advise her to accept these proposals, could I?",
  "37137": "What would be the result of a total extraction of the nitrogen?",
  "37138": "Do you not suspect?",
  "37139": "Did it keep you awake?",
  "37140": "Did he think that pride or masterful will or physical strength would help him?",
  "37141": "Need any help, officer?",
  "37142": "What's the row now?",
  "37143": "Why are you so bad?",
  "37144": "She never spoke to a soul?",
  "37145": "DO you think race corresponds with nationality?",
  "37146": "Could I ever have believed then that I could come to such humiliation?",
  "37147": "Do you belong to the nobility?",
  "37148": "D'you think they care for us?",
  "37149": "You bring me great news, then, monsieur?",
  "37150": "Did I say above, or seem to imply, that the judge sometimes spoke harshly to his wife?",
  "37151": "Not in health?",
  "37152": "And we have admitted that justice is the excellence of the soul, and injustice the defect of the soul?",
  "37153": "Did you really?",
  "37154": "What was he doing?",
  "37155": "Didn't you know the difference yourself?",
  "37156": "Is he out of his senses?",
  "37157": "Who then?",
  "37158": "Why do I feel so inclined to tease him?",
  "37159": "What monstrous place is this?",
  "37160": "Why can't you leave me alone?",
  "37161": "Where is the use of our reckoning?",
  "37162": "Why isn't it your business?",
  "37163": "Then you don't wish me to, dearest?",
  "37164": "You are AFRAID of it?",
  "37165": "Don't they come after it any more?",
  "37166": "Where is the prisoner?",
  "37167": "Is he generally liked?",
  "37168": "Do you mean write to her myself?",
  "37169": "So soon?",
  "37170": "Will not the guardians be the smallest of all the classes who receive a name from the profession of some kind of knowledge?",
  "37171": "A telegram?",
  "37172": "That's the boy, is it?",
  "37173": "At whose house?",
  "37174": "Is this possible, count?",
  "37175": "Which of them do you call her best friend?",
  "37176": "Is sugar always to be produced by vital blood?",
  "37177": "Was it a fear that he should deliver this name to the hazards of another memory than his own?",
  "37178": "You think it's certain he's there?",
  "37179": "Would they not have been as unwilling to part with them as with gold, and have compelled them to stay at home with them?",
  "37180": "Who did you pass on the road?",
  "37181": "What could she do but sob?",
  "37182": "What was that you told me before we left the old house?",
  "37183": "Beautiful and lusty?",
  "37184": "And is not the soul almost or altogether indissoluble?",
  "37185": "Buried amongst them, what met my eye?",
  "37186": "Yes, isn't it extraordinarily fine?",
  "37187": "What is the matter with him?",
  "37188": "Might he not well inform the doctor that he had something to tell him for his advantage?",
  "37189": "But how can we gain your freedom?",
  "37190": "Or is this a subject in which new discoveries can be made?",
  "37191": "Or haven't you pluck enough to go on?",
  "37192": "Has he got to be harnessed up and driven through life like a horse?",
  "37193": "What to do with him?",
  "37194": "If she had died, or if we hadn't caught her, where should we all have been?",
  "37195": "Assuming also, again I say, that physical obstacles can be overcome, is not the time opportune for making a start?",
  "37196": "Yeh infernal fool, don't yeh know enough t' quit when there ain't anything t' shoot at?",
  "37197": "Why should it?",
  "37198": "Don't you love to ride?",
  "37199": "Are you badly hurt?",
  "37200": "Has he many men, then?",
  "37201": "Will there be mercy for me there?",
  "37202": "I hope your father is well?",
  "37203": "Why then am I dissatisfied if I am going to do the things for which I exist and for which I was brought into the world?",
  "37204": "I tell you?",
  "37205": "You are no longer my father?",
  "37206": "And why, my young friend?",

  "39200": "Now you know what kind of a fellow I am, what do you think of me?",
  "39201": "Where's your keeper?",
  "39202": "I want to know, now, when that thing takes place, what do you mean to do?",
  "39203": "And what said he, my daughter?",
  "39204": "Give up?",
  "39205": "What is amiss, since the night is yet young?",
  "39206": "Will that be all, sir?",
  "39207": "And what was his mission?",
  "39208": "How are your rock people coming on?",
  "39209": "But how could I go back to my laboratory, mixed classes with young ladies, you know, after a thing like that?",
  "39210": "The rice too?",
  "39211": "Tom?",
  "39212": "Still, do not the turnkeys talk with your prisoners?",
  "39213": "We are pursued?",
  "39214": "Well, and are these of any military use?",
  "39215": "You have not breakfasted, have you?",
  "39216": "What on earth has come over her?",
  "39217": "Then why have you said all this to me?",
  "39218": "Have you any fresh ORDERS for my daughter, sir?",
  "39219": "Of the lodge?",
  "39220": "What is the matter with you, my little fellow?",
  "39221": "Of what use are the patents for invention, imagination, amelioration, and improvement?",
  "39222": "Can you think me insensible of the interest you show me, or ungrateful for it?",
  "39223": "What has become of her, that you should have forgotten her?",
  "39224": "What, gone?",
  "39225": "Supposing you get 'em and take 'em out to dinner?",
  "39226": "You, madame?",
  "39227": "What on earth will become of him now?",
  "39228": "Has your governess left you?",
  "39229": "Well, do you know if the persons you see there are rich or poor, if their sacks of wheat are not rubies or diamonds?",
  "39230": "Hadn't I better ride over, your excellency?",
  "39231": "And what is it to me?",
  "39232": "Hxw nxw?",
  "39233": "But how can we get back?",
  "39234": "Oh, he's weally bwought it off then, has he?",
  "39235": "It doesn't seem right to hurry through it, does it?",
  "39236": "Where next?",
  "39237": "Shall I call a taxi?",
  "39238": "Packed your uniform?",
  "39239": "What are you doing?",
  "39240": "When they are dead, what shall I drive?",
  "39241": "How long have I slept?",
  "39242": "What do you advise?",
  "39243": "Will you swear that it will not be in that spirit?",
  "39244": "What can possess him to come home in that style?",
  "39245": "You are not sorry that you met me, are you, dearest?",
  "39246": "What would ye do then?",
  "39247": "How much is it?",
  "39248": "Can't you see these are strangers, and should be treated with respect?",
  "39249": "Do you rehearse in the afternoons?",
  "39250": "Did he expect to find him so?",
  "39251": "How could he expect it?",
  "39252": "Why do you call him that?",
  "39253": "Or, rather, would it not be an insult to reason, to put the question?",
  "39254": "What of the quarry ye went to kill?",
  "39255": "Why don't ye kiss one another, my children?",
  "39256": "Came we hither to eat or to fight?",
  "39257": "D'you think it's good?",
  "39258": "Have you any other wish besides this, my lord?",
  "39259": "What shall we say, sir, for the elephant?",
  "39260": "What could they distinguish at a distance which they could not estimate?",
  "39261": "I have deceived you?",
  "39262": "But who knows if it would be well received?",
  "39263": "Why should the people trust in tribunes, when kings perjure themselves?",
  "39264": "What's this I hear?",
  "39265": "Why pine, or be ashamed of my defeat?",
  "39266": "What d'you mean?",
  "39267": "Who seeks him?",
  "39268": "Is that likely?",
  "39269": "But shall we be right in getting rid of them?",
  "39270": "Must it not have been a good act, when it was attended, in the very act of performance, by such blessed consequences?",
  "39271": "How could you sustain a siege, when you weep over the absence of an actress?",
  "39272": "You do not guess?",
  "39273": "Do you know the way?",
  "39274": "Do you not think better of him for his resolve?",
  "39275": "But what are we to do?",
  "39276": "Come now, you don't really wish it?",
  "39277": "You thoroughly understand me, sir?",
  "39278": "But what could he deduce from that?",
  "39279": "What was there left for him?",
  "39280": "Can it be said that the royal form does more?",
  "39281": "Is it safe now, dearest mother?",
  "39282": "Where are the pistols?",
  "39283": "Would anyone else than a madman make them?",
  "39284": "Whose fault is it that we were together as children?",
  "39285": "Do you think so, sire?",
  "39286": "You are sure you are well?",
  "39287": "But what are you about there?",
  "39288": "What girl?",
  "39289": "The count's?",
  "39290": "Handle me?",
  "39291": "Did you observe that in life?",
  "39292": "Who did ever say, except by way of irony, that such a one was a man of great virtue, but an egregious blockhead?",
  "39293": "We'll see her safe to the omnibus?",
  "39294": "Has any letter come for me lately?",
  "39295": "Should you not have known me better?",
  "39296": "Did you say he was coming?",
  "39297": "Is he well known?",
  "39298": "Is anybody in attendance who knows anything more?",
  "39299": "You didn't know her?",
  "39300": "Away, is he?",
  "39301": "What have you done to deserve it?",
  "39302": "In a month?",
  "39303": "Do you intend devoting it to charitable purposes, then?",
  "39304": "What was it you were saying about reality?",
  "39305": "You want to know with what I bait?",
  "39306": "What good are promises and gratitude?",
  "39307": "Was she going to expose a little scandal in open court?",
  "39308": "How am I to begin, so that they may be able to understand partially, at all events?",
  "39309": "Why hadn't I warned him?",
  "39310": "Who is this fellow?",
  "39311": "What are my commands?",
  "39312": "Do you want to go to doing different from what's in the books, and get things all muddled up?",
  "39313": "What is his family?",
  "39314": "Did not say what you had made up your mind to say?",
  "39315": "Was inheritance a question of liking or of responsibility?",
  "39316": "And how could her presence at the bay facilitate our means of getting there?",
  "39317": "You will do me the kindness to remember, sir, that I am not at present placed?",
  "39318": "What did that mean?",
  "39319": "What was his frank judgment of so much of its ugliness, he asked himself, but a part of the cultivation of humility?",
  "39320": "I suppose you mean, reform the whole order of society?",
  "39321": "Is the general at the camp?",
  "39322": "He hasn't forgotten the appointment, I hope?",
  "39323": "Have I explained away any part of my guilt?",
  "39324": "What the devil's this?",
  "39325": "But what is woman for man?",
  "39326": "WHY WON'T THEY HAVE ANY ONE COME NEAR THEM NOW?",
  "39327": "Two years?",
  "39328": "Who can explain why one species ranges widely and is very numerous, and why another allied species has a narrow range and is rare?",
  "39329": "You mean, my man, that the crew contemplates mutiny?",
  "39330": "Should they be in time to save him?",
  "39331": "But why fight at all, in that case?",
  "39332": "Murder him?",
  "39333": "By cooling?",
  "39334": "Where are the others?",
  "39335": "So you are going to travel together?",
  "39336": "I say, keep off, can't you?",
  "39337": "So you have made up your mind to stay?",
  "39338": "Can they have received any news, my lord?",
  "39339": "How many more have been here today?",
  "39340": "Why have mules no young ones?",
  "39341": "Do you lie down or sit up on these when you sleep?",
  "39342": "Where should I have lost myself?",
  "39343": "What do the doctors say?",
  "39344": "How should they be wise?",
  "39345": "As ugly?",
  "39346": "How much wiser will you be then?",
  "39347": "And, after all, is it quite so certain that a genetic relation may not underlie the classification of minerals?",
  "39348": "What is it you see?",
  "39349": "Were you kept under lock and key?",
  "39350": "May I speak to him?",
  "39351": "Will you give me your word not to try to escape?",
  "39352": "You will go south?",
  "39353": "There will be no reporters among them?",
  "39354": "Are you content, sire?",
  "39355": "Will the interment take place here?",
  "39356": "What do you care?",
  "39357": "How, then, did philosophers come to consider reality to be unknowable and hidden behind or beyond appearances?",
  "39358": "But how about your dinner?",
  "39359": "How will you like that?",
  "39360": "Against what?",
  "39361": "Then what said I?",
  "39362": "What sort of proposal is that to make a man?",
  "39363": "But why should the rich pay more than the poor?",
  "39364": "And doctor, as to life, what is it after all?",
  "39365": "Shall I go on, sir?",
  "39366": "Are you satisfied?",
  "39367": "Gower?",
  "39368": "Isn't it odd?",
  "39369": "What else could he say?",
  "39370": "Do you mean that I am the man you seek?",
  "39371": "Wherein was the charm?",
  "39372": "Been in front tonight?",
  "39373": "Time enough to learn its contents?",
  "39374": "And suppose they could be induced by a proclamation of freedom from me to throw themselves upon us, what should we do with them?",
  "39375": "Or, rather, what bad taste and tedium will not be the infallible result?",
  "39376": "And what hand would be powerful enough to throw a ball to give such a shock as that?",
  "39377": "What sort of a face had he?",
  "39378": "Got anything to eat?",
  "39379": "Well, and what harm?",
  "39380": "Have we struck land?",
  "39381": "What is the matter with the mutton, my dear?",
  "39382": "Gentlemanly, wasn't it?",
  "39383": "What can a man do?",
  "39384": "Non sunt tibi millia centum?",
  "39385": "Captain, did you ever prove yourself upon any of our masters of defence here?",
  "39386": "How can we be saved from this terrible, unquenchable fire?",
  "39387": "And went into a bank instead?",
  "39388": "What are you thinking about?",
  "39389": "Were you really in earnest when you said that you could love a man of lowly position?",
  "39390": "What is the cause which makes the outlines of the shadow vague and confused?",
  "39391": "Who can, unmoved, behold the dreadful light?",
  "39392": "Take a seat, will you?",
  "39393": "Have you anything else to secure, madam?",
  "39394": "But what's the use of complaining?",
  "39395": "You think it would do with these alterations, then?",
  "39396": "Doth nothing go against thy conscience here?",
  "39397": "Is that your game?",
  "39398": "And where do the servants sleep?",
  "39399": "Is not this the true light in which it ought to be regarded?",
  "39400": "Where have they gone?",
  "39401": "Shall we stagger forth?",
  "39402": "Is this quite true you tell me?",
  "39403": "Did no one ever tell you I had come to live here?",
  "39404": "Isn't it just as if I had turned slowly and on a long detour from a man into a child, from a thinker into a childlike person?",
  "39405": "Who is responsible for this?",
  "39406": "Merely from the standpoint of the individual?",
  "39407": "Who would not have done just as she did?",
  "39408": "What disaster took their reason away from men?",
  "39409": "But even suppose blood shed when the conscience is wounded?",
  "39410": "Is there a way for me to see it?",
  "39411": "But what proof have I of their authenticity?",
  "39412": "Let him make a tool of me afresh and again?",
  "39413": "How can I?",
  "39414": "Don't you see any bearing upon the case?",
  "39415": "Safer from loving me?",
  "39416": "I hope you picked up your coin?",
  "39417": "Was it just the proximity of that young girl, or was it merely an odd accident?",
  "39418": "But what misery is it to know this?",
  "39419": "And pretty girls?",
  "39420": "Doctor, you live in this quarter, I believe?",
  "39421": "You will not allow me to kiss your hand?",
  "39422": "You are always there, are you not?",
  "39423": "This is where it would have to be, if we did it in the usual way?",
  "39424": "Halloa?",
  "39425": "Which is a just principle?",
  "39426": "Are you so much afraid, then, of being vulgar?",
  "39427": "Which are your windows?",
  "39428": "Why private?",
  "39429": "Where is her stepmother?",
  "39430": "Then why are you still vexed and grieved?",
  "39431": "Shall I take him another ruby?",
  "39432": "How was it that she had come to that little town?",
  "39433": "Well, what is to be done now?",
  "39434": "I wonder if it be she against whom I was warned, and whom I in turn did warn?",
  "39435": "How did it all come to be like that?",
  "39436": "And why did the tramp take nothing?",
  "39437": "Is it jolly there?",
  "39438": "Where can it be?",
  "39439": "And what would you have these workingmen do?",
  "39440": "Why is it that a woman can see from a distance what a man cannot see close?",
  "39441": "You don't know the news, then?",
  "39442": "Well, young sir, what do you learn at school?",
  "39443": "A dog's leg, or what kind of leg?",
  "39444": "Where did he get it?",
  "39445": "Shall we do it now?",
  "39446": "Are you wounded?",
  "39447": "But why have you made me a prisoner?",
  "39448": "Can't you marry him because you love me?",
  "39449": "What power of cannon might it take to shake that rusty old man out of his immovable composure?",
  "39450": "Have we any right to wait with patience?",
  "39451": "Well, what would you say about papa?",
  "39452": "Do you hear?",
  "39453": "Will you step forward and tell me?",
  "39454": "Have you, then, power against death?",
  "39455": "But how do I know you haven't bargained already in the same way with your father?",
  "39456": "Were not you naughty?",
  "39457": "Is this right?",
  "39458": "You do think she's safe, sir?",
  "39459": "What makes you ask that?",
  "39460": "What do you mean by the SCOTIA?",
  "39461": "Have I not understood it myself?",
  "39462": "It was rather nice of me, really, don't you see?",
  "39463": "But when will this happen, monsieur?",
  "39464": "What does man want more?",
  "39465": "You know, of course, how successful he has been?",
  "39466": "You didn't make that clear?",
  "39467": "Is that your loss?",
  "39468": "First of all, what is your name?",
  "39469": "What need to hurry?",
  "39470": "A clerk?",
  "39471": "And if they are to be what we were describing, is there not another quality which they should also possess?",
  "39472": "That gentlemanly young man, who is so considerate?",
  "39473": "What is it to be?",
  "39474": "How can he bear to grieve me so, when I have lived only for him through all these years?",
  "39475": "Does gov'ment send 'em to us?",
  "39476": "He might get up for that, mightn't he?",
  "39477": "Can't things stay as they are?",
  "39478": "Where are your wives?",
  "39479": "Oh yes, why not?",
  "39480": "Then?",
  "39481": "But tell me, how will your husband look at the matter?",
  "39482": "Pray, gentlemen, may I be so bold so as to ask the place from whence you came?",
  "39483": "Who's dead now?",
  "39484": "Does it not?",
  "39485": "What do they want with me?",
  "39486": "Has your mistress sent you here?",
  "39487": "Ain't they ever goin' to open up?",
  "39488": "What is that cloud?",
  "39489": "Now speak, my little bloodthirsty queen, whose head will you have?",
  "39490": "What is that in the chimney?",
  "39491": "Fifty?",
  "39492": "You know that a mitigation has come?",
  "39493": "For my face?",
  "39494": "Should I give her happiness?",
  "39495": "Don't you see a thinness in him?",
  "39496": "Yes, have you not heard?",
  "39497": "And that I had actually ruined her, as she calls it?",
  "39498": "What do you suppose I should have done if you had been dead?",
  "39499": "But how do you get back and forwards to your work?",
  "39500": "What strange whizzing noise is this in the air?",
  "39501": "Have you ever had any experience in the wholesale dry goods business?",
  "39502": "So short?",
  "39503": "And how long did that last?",
  "39504": "Who knows that it is not a snare?",
  "39505": "How would he avenge himself upon the girl who had betrayed him to his enemies?",
  "39506": "And at what time did it occur?",
  "39507": "You're not going away?",
  "39508": "My dear vicomte, do you not know better than that?",
  "39509": "Who cried stop?",
  "39510": "Does he ever mean to preach again?",
  "39511": "Vere is de dollar und a quarter?",
  "39512": "Was it there while I was there?",
  "39513": "But why did he not speak more clearly?",
  "39514": "Do you mean that I'm responsible?",
  "39515": "What line would you advise me to study?",
  "39516": "How did you know it?",
  "39517": "But, my friends, who is a pauper, or who is a criminal?",
  "39518": "Does not my life lie open and clear before you all?",
  "39519": "Where find the meat, and where the vesture?",
  "39520": "You have assassinated a woman, then?",
  "39521": "Did he understand the child's heart?",
  "39522": "I suppose they don't learn you that, where you go to school?",
  "39523": "Have I killed you?",
  "39524": "Art learned?",
  "39525": "You didn't?",
  "39526": "You would do so?",
  "39527": "Then what can be the matter with your finger?",
  "39528": "Do you know why?",
  "39529": "Why, was he drunk?",
  "39530": "Is this the real reason of your coming?",
  "39531": "Don't you know?",
  "39532": "Are you too proud to accept it, young gentleman?",
  "39533": "Is he armed?",
  "39534": "What good do I get?",
  "39535": "How does it happen there's no good bread?",
  "39536": "Why should he?",
  "39537": "Well and had you not the resource of weak states?",
  "39538": "And how was the captain called, senor?",
  "39539": "And who taught you to paint wind?",
  "39540": "Is there?",
  "39541": "Of what was I thinking when my lover stood before me and I should have welcomed him, that I would not listen to his words?",
  "39542": "But why should MY wish be obeyed?",
  "39543": "And what do ye next, men?",
  "39544": "You reject this means of information, then?",
  "39545": "Aren't they, for that matter, intimately together now?",
  "39546": "You got my telegram?",
  "39547": "Do you say as a monk?",
  "39548": "Do you remember him?",
  "39549": "Then, if we can but strike so wild, why keep meddling?",
  "39550": "Why don't you burn, you little fools?",
  "39551": "Bounderby's?",
  "39552": "How now, lads?",
  "39553": "Why is it not itself the net product?",
  "39554": "You saw a good deal of him, I suppose?",
  "39555": "Is he alive?",
  "39556": "Crofton?",
  "39557": "What have you eaten?",
  "39558": "Are you going to take upon yourselves to swear, that that boy upstairs is the boy that was put through the little window last night?",
  "39559": "What are you doing then?",
  "39560": "Have you, gentle reader, ever loved at first sight?",
  "39561": "For what purpose make a partition of goods, where every one has already more than enough?",
  "39562": "How many shall I lay for, my lord?",
  "39563": "What had his intelligence been given him for but to save him?",
  "39564": "We needn't quarrel because our parents did, need we?",
  "39565": "You think I could slip in and be taken for a guest?",
  "39566": "Are you in a hurry?",
  "39567": "Then how can he who has magnificence of mind and is the spectator of all time and all existence, think much of human life?",
  "39568": "What did make him act so?",
  "39569": "I hope you've forgot nothink?",
  "39570": "Was that a good reason for thrashing him?",
  "39571": "Why do you think, my dear friend, that we have gone astray?",
  "39572": "Well, then, what have you decided?",
  "39573": "Leave them to pull through?",
  "39574": "What would you do withal?",
  "39575": "Of what was that barricade made?",
  "39576": "Don't you think it very odd that it shouldn't be given to me?",
  "39577": "But what are you going to do in the morning?",
  "39578": "Who took him out of it?",
  "39579": "Don't you know this gentleman, sir?",
  "39580": "You like that best?",
  "39581": "And did you recognize his voice?",
  "39582": "But why don't you come near me, as you used to do when you were a little boy?",
  "39583": "Was it an entire army?",
  "39584": "Does it not seem cruel?",
  "39585": "What am I about?",
  "39586": "And what did he say?",
  "39587": "What are you standing there for?",
  "39588": "But what could we do?",
  "39589": "What does the world owe to the adventurer?",
  "39590": "Will they not produce corn, and wine, and clothes, and shoes, and build houses for themselves?",
  "39591": "Have we any difficulty to comprehend the force of humanity and benevolence?",
  "39592": "Are you waiting for him underneath these windows?",
  "39593": "Tried to steal you, eh?",
  "39594": "Who has made the least allusion to gold watches?",
  "39595": "If not, what is his parallel worth?",
  "39596": "Is it fearing I won't pay you, you are?",

  "40382": "And why was I so furious about it?",
  "40383": "Now, who was that someone?",
  "40384": "Who told you so?",
  "40385": "And can't we have a good time, too?",
  "40386": "How long is this thing going on like this?",
  "40387": "How much did it cost him?",
  "40388": "How are we today?",
  "40389": "Need I recall either the scene or the national circumstances attending the occasion?",

  "40500": "Are you staying to talk?",
  "40501": "In what relation must she salute you as her uncle, or as her husband?",
  "40502": "Do the races or species of men, whichever term may be applied, encroach on and replace one another, so that some finally become extinct?",
  "40503": "Don't you realise that you're enjoying a very rare, a very exquisite privilege?",
  "40504": "Your crime?",
  "40505": "What have I been waiting for?",
  "40506": "Morrel?",

  "42387": "What do you mean, what are you saying?",
  "42388": "That would be a strange turn of things, now wouldn't it, eh?",
  "42389": "If even things which are foreseen sometimes hurt us, what can things which are not foreseen do, but grievously injure?",
  "42390": "Suppose we select an example of either kind, in order that we may have a general notion of them?",
  "42391": "Kenwigses have got a boy, haven't they?",
  "42392": "What is a being?",
  "42393": "Then you keep moving round, I suppose?",
  "42394": "Have you not tried before to perfect yourself and become better, and nothing has come of it?",
  "42395": "Have we relations with the court?",
  "42396": "You'll take part in the service, I suppose?",
  "42397": "Why did they separate, guardian?",
  "42398": "Did my young men take his scalp?",
  "42399": "You know about her trouble?",
  "42400": "What will that be?",
  "42401": "What right has he not to wish to receive me into his family?",
  "42402": "Have I not then the mourner's privilege?",
  "42403": "Will you explain what the trouble is?",
  "42404": "Can you see a place to land?",
  "42405": "Why don't you sit down, little boy?",
  "42406": "Stay in the country all the time, do you mean?",
  "42407": "It is all vanity to be sure, but who will not own to liking a little of it?",
  "42408": "Would her death affect any one's interest?",
  "42409": "How come your boots are so muddy?",
  "42410": "Why are they here?",
  "42411": "What did he mean?",
  "42412": "Was he silenced?",
  "42413": "How could anything right come from him or from her?",
  "42414": "What did you do that for, any way?",
  "42415": "You are not going out?",
  "42416": "Well, my dear?",
  "42417": "What is the cause of all that dust?",
  "42418": "Wasn't it a joke?",
  "42419": "So we will not say anything about it, or let them take her away?",
  "42420": "Does that interest you?",
  "42421": "Does he believe that I think of a wretched fiddle when the spirit speaks to me?",
  "42422": "But to whom should I say that?",
  "42423": "What do they aim at proving?",
  "42424": "And have I found where thy money lies?",
  "42425": "Who is ambitious?",
  "42426": "Don't you say, dear d'Artagnan, that it is the queen who has made choice of the convent for her?",
  "42427": "Come, what did she say?",
  "42428": "Doctor, what would you think now of my getting married?",
  "42429": "Is she absolutely unapproachable?",
  "42430": "Why will it vex itself, and twist its little face into bewitching nutcrackers?",
  "42431": "What, now, directly?",
  "42432": "While we are ignorant whether a man were aggressor or not, how can we determine whether the person who killed him be criminal or innocent?",
  "42433": "But how far was their advice to be respected?",
  "42434": "Was there another such a wretched being as she in the world?",
  "42435": "Why be so distressed?",
  "42436": "Will you speak it to whom I wish?",
  "42437": "That's what you mean, is it?",
  "42438": "But how are we to get down below this liquid surface?",
  "42439": "Where do sail from?",
  "42440": "What can I do to make this child understand me?",
  "42441": "I did?",
  "42442": "What would you pay?",
  "42443": "And are there no cardinals that can fight?",
  "42444": "This being the case, gentlemen, how would it do for us to agree to a change like this?",
  "42445": "Is that all true?",
  "42446": "Can we not escape from this country?",
  "42447": "What shall we do now?",
  "42448": "But when I tell you I am married, is it not a consequence that we must have new clothes?",
  "42449": "You know it well, then?",
  "42450": "A lover on a day of farewell, a husband on a day of revenge, or the one whose head it had graced on the day of despair?",
  "42451": "So you will manage the empty coffin?",
  "42452": "But was the dawn wonderful?",
  "42453": "Nobody came into the room at all?",
  "42454": "Didn't you see me?",
  "42455": "Why is he cross with me?",
  "42456": "What's the use?",
  "42457": "Well, mate?",
  "42458": "This outward mourning, what does it signify?",
  "42459": "What was that, sir?",
  "42460": "What sudden eagerness is this you evince?",
  "42461": "Hain't he run off?",
  "42462": "Why won't you try and be good?",
  "42463": "What has she to reflect about, who must obey?",
  "42464": "Why this delay?",
  "42465": "Do his fits begin like that?",
  "42466": "Is there some new reason for this banishment?",
  "42467": "Will you give me that?",
  "42468": "Ah, you knew that?",
  "42469": "Where is the standard of perfection to be found?",
  "42470": "What order do you refer to?",
  "42471": "D'yeh think so?",
  "42472": "Of an evening?",
  "42473": "How could a ghost be alive?",
  "42474": "If these gentlemen are so patriotic, why don't they buy us out?",
  "42475": "You speak of an evil time, and nevertheless you hope, your highness?",
  "42476": "Was he a gentleman?",
  "42477": "For who is there coming humbly to the fountain of sweetness, carrieth not away thence at the least some little of that sweetness?",
  "42478": "Shall I do it?",
  "42479": "Whar'll I be, when a stone goes six times as far as it does on heah?",
  "42480": "What force has a multitude?",
  "42481": "Are you sure you can do it carefully, my worthy man?",
  "42482": "Is mine less hard to bear or is it harder to bear, when my whole living was in it and has been thus shamefully sucked away?",
  "42483": "Of what nature?",
  "42484": "What doth the lad mean?",
  "42485": "Is it strange that a man whose kindness is thus abused, should send sheriff's officers to reclaim what is due to him?",
  "42486": "And where did he get it, mamma?",
  "42487": "I will appeal to any of these gentlemen, could I leave my guest in the hands of a hideous bandit, as you term him?",
  "42488": "What people are you leading thus into the bowels of the earth?",
  "42489": "But not actually raining?",
  "42490": "Was there anything peculiar about any of those skeletons?",
  "42491": "And why didn't I go away, now, if I couldn't bear her?",
  "42492": "How does opium induce sleep?",
  "42493": "Quite so, but how was it to be done, how to prevent it?",
  "42494": "What can he mean by all this about money?",
  "42495": "But what happened thereupon?",
  "42496": "Who are you at all?",
  "42497": "And do you know what reward we shall offer them?",
  "42498": "About breakfast?",
  "42499": "What right had the friendless to complain?",
  "42500": "If I ran your unfortunate friend through the body, what did I do with the body?",
  "42501": "Did your client commit the robbery?",
  "42502": "You suppose that it will be good?",
  "42503": "Is it a dream of pain, or of pleasure?",
  "42504": "Why did you not stop him till I came?",
  "42505": "But once more, what is there to fear?",
  "42506": "Are not two prayers a perfect strength?",
  "42507": "Will you have a cigarette?",
  "42508": "And what are you crying for?",
  "42509": "Have you any reason to suspect robbery?",
  "42510": "Didn't I say that your police were good for nothing?",
  "42511": "Do you take me for a brute?",
  "42512": "What did you do it for?",
  "42513": "Do you know what they fought about?",
  "42514": "D'ye think me, noble general, such a sot?",
  "42515": "Why should she taunt him this way unless she had good grounds?",
  "42516": "And are you very sure that we have done nothing before we were born?",
  "42517": "And can ALL the flowers talk?",
  "42518": "Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?",
  "42519": "Who are you, aged man?",
  "42520": "Did you take his number?",
  "42521": "Don't you expose it to a good deal of excitement, sir?",
  "42522": "Then what's the use of my money to me?",
  "42523": "Can I ever make amends for this murder and this crime?",
  "42524": "You know him?",
  "42525": "But what brought it on?",
  "42526": "Do you know this weighs thirty pounds?",
  "42527": "How many of us begin a new record with each day of our lives?",
  "42528": "Are you going to write, papa?",
  "42529": "May I beg to be excused from being present at his examination?",
  "42530": "And how is your wrist?",
  "42531": "And the balloon withstood it?",
  "42532": "Month by month things were stepping livelier, but to what goal?",
  "42533": "Shall I help him?",
  "42534": "And think so?",
  "42535": "If we greet at that, what'll we do when true sorrow comes across us?",
  "42536": "Ye seem mighty anxious?",
  "42537": "Him, who leaves me to perish in a dungeon?",
  "42538": "When was sciolism ever dissociated from laxity?",
  "42539": "Why didn't I die?",
  "42540": "What did he make his money in?",
  "42541": "To deceive the police?",
  "42542": "What on earth am I to do?",
  "42543": "Where then is thy imagination?",
  "42544": "Who is it that keeps on insisting?",
  "42545": "What's that for?",
  "42546": "You pardon me?",
  "42547": "Is there a but?",
  "42548": "The thief?",
  "42549": "You spoke to him in a low tone of voice, what did you say to him?",
  "42550": "Have ye forgot what seem'd your dread before?",
  "42551": "What was it all?",
  "42552": "She was not expecting us?",
  "42553": "And what do you think to do when you leave here?",
  "42554": "Who melted her?",
  "42555": "Buonaparte?",
  "42556": "Is my master coming?",
  "42557": "Can't I go too?",
  "42558": "Where are my friends?",
  "42559": "How was he in such circumstances to be gentle?",
  "42560": "Has he served in the army?",
  "42561": "It's not my fault if I forget, is it?",
  "42562": "What do you say, sire?",
  "42563": "Are bodies placed in canoes?",
  "42564": "Would you not be happier if you tried to forget her severity, together with the passionate emotions it excited?",
  "42565": "May I ask what that signifies?",
  "42566": "So, sir, and what say you?",
  "42567": "Why shouldn't we make them real?",
  "42568": "Besides, why should he have mentioned it?",
  "42569": "What great things to lift them above the level of their fellows?",
  "42570": "And why had she kept it hidden?",
  "42571": "You must allow that there is nothing supernatural about this, at any rate?",
  "42572": "Do you wish to send up a card?",
  "42573": "What plan?",
  "42574": "And then, whence was to come the money for the journey?",
  "42575": "Will you give my sister leave?",
  "42576": "Begg'd a reversion from them?",
  "42577": "And what about the wounded horses?",
  "42578": "Percy did what?",
  "42579": "Can we have the honor of seeing his highness?",
  "42580": "What was the nature of this air?",
  "42581": "Was there a great sensation?",
  "42582": "But if he hasn't been spreading it, how do you know?",
  "42583": "Then why do you do it, if it's a clear loss?",
  "42584": "I wonder if I should blossom out half as well as you have, if I tried it?",
  "42585": "If we emancipate, are you willing to educate?",
  "42586": "Suppose he has some of the people here in his power?",
  "42587": "Why my subsequent lawless life?",
  "42588": "What good would it have done?",
  "42589": "And I presume you know what that unfortunate movement led to?",
  "42590": "An't yer mine, now, body and soul?",
  "42591": "Do you think that, knowing myself, I can be happy now?",
  "42592": "Who knows what its reply will be?",
  "42593": "Good wheeze, wasn't it?",
  "42594": "In what element will it mix, giving or receiving fresh energy?",
  "42595": "What kind of society, what kind of world are we building for them?",
  "42596": "What do you say of my plan, monseigneur?",
  "42597": "In such principles?",
  "42598": "Why has the law sanctioned this abuse of power?",
  "42599": "Did he love the woman or hate her?",
  "42600": "I suppose nobody has come while I've been away?",
  "42601": "What withers in the bud?",
  "42602": "But why did not this ideologist perceive that man is not proprietor even of his own faculties?",
  "42603": "Are you not going to keep your promise of introducing me to the fair subject of our remarks?",
  "42604": "Imprisoned him, too?",
  "42605": "What DO you want, man?",
  "42606": "Who are you?",
  "42607": "Are there no women living unmarried, and even the happier for it?",
  "42608": "How many will you take?",
  "42609": "Will one of you help me, please?",
  "42610": "Did he keep careful account of his minutes?",
  "42611": "And what's become of him?",
  "42612": "Do you know that I count the hours?",
  "42613": "Your mission is not accomplished?",
  "42614": "And will you do it now?",
  "42615": "It was this gentleman?",
  "42616": "Son of yours?",
  "42617": "What think you of it?",
  "42618": "Grill room?",
  "42619": "But is it absolutely necessary?",
  "42620": "Whose son can he be?",
  "42621": "But don't I get out?",
  "42622": "How are they?",
  "42623": "Answer me, do not these crimes exist?",
  "42624": "But to whom was he to do justice?",
  "42625": "I seek?",
  "42626": "What did I tell you, my lord?",
  "42627": "But do you suppose that any of our friends are still alive?",
  "42628": "Is it not well done?",
  "42629": "Make of it?",
  "42630": "Was your father a professional man?",
  "42631": "Don't I sit before you, every way, just as much a man as you are?",
  "42632": "Was he so sure that he would enjoy wearing clothes again?",
  "42633": "You recognise then that you've failed?",
  "42634": "Where's your husband?",
  "42635": "Is it not inevitable that reflective men, who cherish beliefs, should endeavor to give a more or less clear and reasoned account of them?",
  "42636": "Who asked me to face the situation and accept it?",
  "42637": "Besides, must not justice be done and our education be finished?",
  "42638": "But how fair?",
  "42639": "Who is that lady?",
  "42640": "See whom?",
  "42641": "Could she bear to think of sinking to his?",
  "42642": "How can you reconcile that with his conduct this morning?",
  "42643": "Had he the right to disarrange anything in the condition of the corpse before the official investigation?",
  "42644": "Had he meant to warn her that day?",
  "42645": "Eh?",
  "42646": "By what right, sir?",
  "42647": "And the forbidding principle is derived from reason, and that which bids and attracts proceeds from passion and disease?",
  "42648": "So we are to have visitors, mon prince?",
  "42649": "Thy flattery?",
  "42650": "And the silver plate?",
  "42651": "What, will you murder me?",
  "42652": "Who regards me?",
  "42653": "Don't you hear de trumpet sound?",
  "42654": "What is it that imposes this simultaneous stop?",
  "42655": "How is that known?",
  "42656": "They are all family portraits, I presume?",
  "42657": "Why haven't you told me when I have made you angry?",
  "42658": "He made an excursion, didn't he?",
  "42659": "What do they call this sound?",
  "42660": "Why so badly?",
  "42661": "Drummle?",
  "42662": "What's it to you?",
  "42663": "Say you?",
  "42664": "Where is home?",
  "42665": "How'll she ever know?",
  "42666": "Are you doing any soothsaying?",
  "42667": "What cabriolet?",
  "42668": "And you never grasped her hand, or made any protestations?",
  "42669": "And have you never revisited that village?",
  "42670": "The precious child is safe in bed?",
  "42671": "He hasn't been spreading that poisonous stuff over the town?",
  "42672": "In what language would you like me to converse with him?",
  "42673": "Was a manager a good manager?",
  "42674": "What did she say in that note?",
  "42675": "Can this be love?",
  "42676": "How is it that I have never met you at his house?",
  "42677": "And what was the use of saying facetious things at a time like this?",
  "42678": "Had he been bent to breaking?",
  "42679": "Who are you, and how do you get my name so pat?",
  "42680": "Didn't you, now?",
  "42681": "And are not engaged?",
  "42682": "Is there anything more pleasant than to meditate while walking at a good pace along a highway?",
  "42683": "You can tell, cousin?",
  "42684": "What is the use of it now?",
  "42685": "Why, then, is the practice of the government always the opposite of its theory?",
  "42686": "Quarrel with her?",
  "42687": "Has he been long so?",
  "42688": "How much apiece was it?",
  "42689": "Why should she?",
  "42690": "Do you suppose I could help knowing?",
  "42691": "But the compass?",
  "42692": "What doth it mean?",
  "42693": "But what else can she do?",
  "42694": "But beside the numbers, what is there for sailors to do?",
  "42695": "And how was it?",
  "42696": "On whom should I fling myself away?",
  "42697": "Who was the occupant of the room above?",
  "42698": "You are there too?",
  "42699": "And what could they do for a livelihood, being both so poor?",
  "42700": "Are you as anxious as ever to help on her marriage?",
  "42701": "Well, have you got them?",
  "42702": "And madness?",
  "42703": "Has anything dreadful happened?",
  "42704": "Shall I go yet further?",
  "42705": "Two millions?",
  "42706": "Can I send speeches that nobody has made?",
  "42707": "Can I do anything for you, sir?",
  "42708": "Must I break off with him?",
  "42709": "Tell me, is he to have that too?",
  "42710": "What had he come there for?",
  "42711": "Why don't you sit down?",
  "42712": "Would she meet this question with the same composure?",
  "42713": "Now, what do you think of this rascal?",
  "42714": "Who can say?",
  "42715": "And do you know what they amount to?",
  "42716": "What are you waiting for, father?",
  "42717": "Art not ashamed to brave the public voice?",
  "42718": "And your little girl?",
  "42719": "And what would you want to saw his leg off for, anyway?",
  "42720": "What is it you dislike?",
  "42721": "You will naturally inquire what they did for food such a length of time?",
  "42722": "Won't three months' pay make you hate me less?",
  "42723": "Did he know the law of the possible?",
  "42724": "Will you not estimate your own weakness?",
  "42725": "Count, is it wrong of me to sing?",
  "42726": "But who can limit the extent to which the federative principle may operate effectively?",
  "42727": "And what was the question?",
  "42728": "But surely your excellency will be so good as to inform me whom you are expecting to receive?",
  "42729": "What are you frightened of?",
  "42730": "And wherein can the blind advantage him?",
  "42731": "So long as we know?",
  "42732": "Where do you come from then?",
  "42733": "This is very sad news, but you will excuse me if I say that I do not see how it bears on the subject of your inquiry?",
  "42734": "And can't we cross that in a boat?",
  "42735": "Is that the word?",
  "42736": "He has a spotted face, has he?",
  "42737": "Was not the superintendent, indeed, known for his delicacy and dignity of feeling?",
  "42738": "What ships they had met?",
  "42739": "What could he do?",
  "42740": "Why torture me still more?",
  "42741": "Shall I join the army and enter the service, or wait?",
  "42742": "Only two at a time?",
  "42743": "Do they not?",
  "42744": "Your reputation THERE?",
  "42745": "Umph?",
  "42746": "Why don't you fire?",
  "42747": "I think you knew my sister when we were abroad together better than you know me?",
  "42748": "In short, if I go, will you go too?",
  "42749": "What saith deep midnight's voice indeed?",
  "42750": "Kostya, what's the matter?",
  "42751": "Oh, can't you understand?",
  "42752": "But surely not in this country?",
  "42753": "Have they got him?",
  "42754": "Or find us by ourselves, seeking entertainment in yelling, and sobbing, and rolling on the ground, divided by the whole room?",
  "42755": "Does I?",

  "43385": "Can't you understand?",
  "43386": "We have three days left, you say?",
  "43387": "If I hate him, that's enough, ain't it?",
  "43388": "It must be very lonely to have no one to care about except a parrot, don't you think?",

  "43464": "Now, how many degrees can you count between the two points?",
  "43465": "Didn't sound like a dog, did it?",
  "43466": "Why flock you thus to me in multitudes?",
  "43467": "Can I do otherwise for a father who has done so much for me?",

  "43474": "Why don't you go up to him?",
  "43475": "What are these songs, and what do they mean?",
  "43476": "But what do you hope from keeping him in his mistake?",
  "43477": "Why does he go to thy house?",
  "43478": "Are you ladies changing your quarters?",
  "43479": "Shall I covet my neighbour's maidservant?",

  "45176": "What sort of a fatality, in short, is that which is contradicted every instant by the facts which take place within its bosom?",
  "45177": "And do you really love him quite well enough?",
  "45178": "But how did these women bear themselves amid toils so arduous?",
  "45179": "Volumnia, do I make myself intelligible?",
  "45180": "What ain't a dream?",
  "45181": "Is all the spilt wine swallowed?",
  "45182": "And where is that letter?",
  "45183": "What would become of his wife if he should be convicted?",
  "45184": "He who had ever been so good to her, why had he now failed her so grievously?",
  "45185": "Why do you torture me?",
  "45186": "You are great friends, eh, all together?",
  "45187": "Do you find any trouble or disquiet in your body by the importunate stings and pricklings of the flesh?",
  "45188": "What made your sons go to spring on my sons till my big son was killed by your children?",
  "45189": "Well, then, where do we dine?",
  "45190": "Mightn't I have a little drop of that stuff, just in a cup of coffee?",
  "45191": "Find we no cure for wounds?",
  "45192": "Where did you go?",
  "45193": "Ah, how would she feel then?",
  "45194": "Did he wear a vest?",
  "45195": "Now, do you honestly think they can?",
  "45196": "What is its breadth?",
  "45197": "It's a bad business, eh?",
  "45198": "Do you waltz?",
  "45199": "Have you no place you call a parlour?",
  "45200": "You never intended really to propose to go with me to the altar, and then make yourself rich by one great perjury?",
  "45201": "How could I?",
  "45202": "Are you content with yourself and with your life?",
  "45203": "And what does the author mean to do?",
  "45204": "Was it intentionally?",
  "45205": "May I ask your reason for such an insulting supposition, sir?",
  "45206": "What was the force of that army?",
  "45207": "But of what?",
  "45208": "Do you know where we are going?",
  "45209": "What's the use of it?",
  "45210": "What year?",
  "45211": "But, woe is me, wherefore do I complain?",
  "45212": "Have you a garden of your own?",
  "45213": "Why is not this principle universal?",
  "45214": "Can't you do it more gently?",
  "45215": "And was the sum a large one?",
  "45216": "Why, we are all mortal, are we not?",
  "45217": "Philip, how can you be so unkind?",
  "45218": "Where is he now?",
  "45219": "Will your majesty please proceed?",
  "45220": "And, besides, what is paying it but submission to tyranny?",
  "45221": "But why all this secrecy?",
  "45222": "Oh, gosh?",
  "45223": "Not much in the habit of such travelling yourself, I think, sir?",
  "45224": "But what's the matter with you?",
  "45225": "Besides, what could you have to tell me?",
  "45226": "You know that you are recalled to life?",
  "45227": "Will she be back soon?",
  "45228": "That wasn't right?",
  "45229": "Airing yourself, as I am doing, before you go to bed?",
  "45230": "And the sometime greater to the sometime less, and the greater that is to be to the less that is to be?",
  "45231": "Do you like that dining at the tables d'hote?",
  "45232": "Couldn't one get a book?",
  "45233": "Is the hand not always pointing there?",
  "45234": "Shouldn't they have been happy?",
  "45235": "But who was the spy who stole the papers?",
  "45236": "So it's 'Eat my dear birdies,' is it, young man?",
  "45237": "And yet the cardinal was attached to you?",
  "45238": "Can any woman alive believe you in earnest, or think you design anything but to banter her?",
  "45239": "But, such being the case, where could you have heard the same report?",
  "45240": "Why had he not told her everything?",
  "45241": "Who is that BRAHMA?",
  "45242": "What offence did I commit?",
  "45243": "Where am I to find them?",
  "45244": "What paper have you written for?",
  "45245": "How should the leman of a vassal become a king's wife?",
  "45246": "Where are you from?",
  "45247": "Is it he?",
  "45248": "And these other instruments, the use of which I cannot guess?",
  "45249": "She will pay, only when?",
  "45250": "Do you mean write it to her?",
  "45251": "How do you make that out?",
  "45252": "Russian books, indeed ?",
  "45253": "Will you walk in, sir?",
  "45254": "To whom then?",
  "45255": "You prefer to stay here and imagine that all the world is gaping at your pictures?",
  "45256": "What know I of the minister's heart?",
  "45257": "And why among us four?",
  "45258": "You were looking for me out of the window?",
  "45259": "Has he not already forgotten she ever existed?",
  "45260": "Is he not solid gold?",
  "45261": "What are their secret counsels?",
  "45262": "Who'll say a guinea?",
  "45263": "Do you think I particularly like you?",
  "45264": "Who is he, my dear?",
  "45265": "And did you?",
  "45266": "Shall I ever know any thing?",
  "45267": "Where is that murderer?",
  "45268": "Oh, is it broken?",
  "45269": "And is there no room for love there?",
  "45270": "For not alluding to your leaving us?",
  "45271": "What then must be the result?",
  "45272": "What is all settled?",
  "45273": "Saw you those meteors?",
  "45274": "And what will that good treatment be?",
  "45275": "Well, but is there any war on record which was carried on successfully by him, or aided by his counsels, when he was alive?",
  "45276": "Do you want a map?",
  "45277": "But what other is there?",
  "45278": "You understand the rest, then?",
  "45279": "You couldn't sing a comic song on the pony's back, could you?",
  "45280": "Where were we?",
  "45281": "Would you have 'em both before marriage?",
  "45282": "Why was it?",
  "45283": "What made you choose that particular direction?",
  "45284": "Then the cost of this vessel is great?",
  "45285": "Socrates, has taken possession of you all?",
  "45286": "Have you seen for YOUR self?",
  "45287": "Bore me, my dear?",
  "45288": "How can I ever pay you?",
  "45289": "Give me one little sip more, and tell me from whom you received the noble gift?",
  "45290": "But the orders?",
  "45291": "How here?",
  "45292": "If I don't bring 'em here, what does it matter?",
  "45293": "Did he not, my dear father and mother, deserve all the truth to be told?",
  "45294": "You think that likely?",
  "45295": "Can we not better make the attempt after dark?",
  "45296": "Why don't you put the damned dabs into something that will stay, then?",
  "45297": "Carver, you DO think him witty?",
  "45298": "Don't you know your income?",
  "45299": "Giry?",
  "45300": "Why are they leaving the town?",
  "45301": "What is the meaning of that noise?",
  "45302": "And did you go alone?",
  "45303": "What good wind brings you here?",
  "45304": "And if he were dead, to what height of fury would not the violence of the people lash the legionaries?",
  "45305": "You see I am generous, am I not, mother?",
  "45306": "What charm has gone from the twilight?",
  "45307": "What is it, sir?",
  "45308": "And what brought you here?",
  "45309": "Could he have any, do you suppose?",
  "45310": "FOOD FOR THE VULTURES?",
  "45311": "Is it as nice as it sounds?",
  "45312": "You're no wiser than the rest of us, are you?",
  "45313": "Still dreaming and staring?",
  "45314": "How dare you say such things about me?",
  "45315": "Is it not true that legists are governed by caprice in giving and taking away rights?",
  "45316": "Will you go over and get some canned peaches?",
  "45317": "And you heard nothing, and saw nothing?",
  "45318": "When did he go to church last?",
  "45319": "Which then shall we prefer?",
  "45320": "What more inconstant than the desires of man?",
  "45321": "And you obeyed?",
  "45322": "Which should he take?",
  "45323": "What's the matter?",
  "45324": "Does it not make you shudder?",
  "45325": "What infernal noise?",
  "45326": "Jellyby's?",
  "45327": "Do any of you know of one?",
  "45328": "They did not, and why not?",
  "45329": "When do you leave town?",
  "45330": "He knows what YOU know?",
  "45331": "What are you bothering him for?",
  "45332": "What can it be?",
  "45333": "How, sir?",
  "45334": "You met him once at my place, don't you remember?",
  "45335": "Whom shall we call, lest spectres should appear?",
  "45336": "Differently?",
  "45337": "And how am I to cross?",
  "45338": "But what am I going to eat?",
  "45339": "How often am I to call you?",
  "45340": "Is it not a source of mortification to a class of men that they are excluded from political power?",
  "45341": "Do you see this parcel?",
  "45342": "A murder do you call it?",
  "45343": "Who does not love you?",
  "45344": "And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?",
  "45345": "How like you her wit?",
  "45346": "It's very soon done, sir, isn't it?",
  "45347": "Have you got anything of your own?",
  "45348": "But where are the folk?",
  "45349": "Can't you wait till that day comes?",
  "45350": "But shall I not use tobacco at all?",
  "45351": "Now, when the thing's done, don't you see, can one possibly cast her off?",
  "45352": "Will you never be done getting me into trouble?",
  "45353": "Françoise, all these young fellows not caring two straws for their lives?",
  "45354": "Why, tell me, said he, what answer you would make?",
  "45355": "What can be done with four?",
  "45356": "Was he not contented with his children?",
  "45357": "Can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws?",
  "45358": "You have nothing more to say?",
  "45359": "You told him that?",
  "45360": "Would you advise me, whilst able to fight, to throw the arms I hold in my hand to the ground?",
  "45361": "Now, what do you want with me?",
  "45362": "What are people planning against him?",
  "45363": "Forever a footman?",
  "45364": "But where are we, uncle?",
  "45365": "Wouldn't he be utterly foolish there?",
  "45366": "Who forced my hand, as was the lawful cap'n?",
  "45367": "Will your majesty do me the honor to explain yourself?",
  "45368": "Who could this young woman be, I wonder?",
  "45369": "The beginning of what?",
  "45370": "Who d'you work for?",
  "45371": "Why does the theatre draw me so that I am willing to sacrifice for it even those I love?",
  "45372": "Can you remember?",
  "45373": "What should ail them?",
  "45374": "But why should these rough drafts of letters be regarded as anything else than what they actually and obviously are?",
  "45375": "Why had he married the eyes in the photograph?",
  "45376": "Ned, my dear fellow, will you mention what we agreed upon?",
  "45377": "Do you know what that is?",
  "45378": "Couldn't do it?",
  "45379": "Was he satisfied?",
  "45380": "Have you been for a soldier?",
  "45381": "Where are the brothers?",
  "45382": "He whom your aunt intends for you?",
  "45383": "I was to leave town the next day for a fortnight's absence, and whom had they to see to them?",
  "45384": "What do I ask now?",
  "45385": "What shall we do for dessert?",
  "45386": "Who do you give your casting vote to?",
  "45387": "How is it that this difference happens?",
  "45388": "But do you only labour at the graves of children, and young people?",
  "45389": "What became of the two men?",
  "45390": "And has not the body itself less of truth and essence than the soul?",
  "45391": "Better?",
  "45392": "You came straight here?",
  "45393": "She did, hey?",
  "45394": "All of us?",
  "45395": "Shall we turn back, or run into a cottage?",
  "45396": "Why did his condition improve?",
  "45397": "How was it?",
  "45398": "Will they permit me to enter?",
  "45399": "And if it is not sorcery, what is it, then?",
  "45400": "Was she lying?",
  "45401": "Why do you kneel to me?",
  "45402": "Jane, are you ready?",
  "45403": "Then you suppose it was the people alone who wished to burn the condemned?",
  "45404": "Is it a strict moral obligation?",
  "45405": "I didn't know she was coming, did I?",
  "45406": "Isn't my safety worth a little sacrifice of dogmatic principle?",
  "45407": "Isn't it royal?",
  "45408": "Who came hither?",
  "45409": "How will you judge the counterfeit, if you have no guarantee?",
  "45410": "Damn it now, what's his name?",
  "45411": "And stealing yet more blessed than taking?",
  "45412": "Is there ony room at your feet?",
  "45413": "May I count on you?",
  "45414": "And where am I to sit?",
  "45415": "Where has she taken refuge?",
  "45416": "Why should I go to see them, therefore?",
  "45417": "Are there not the unjust who are fortunate, while the just are unfortunate?",
  "45418": "What would he think of me, of my lack of will?",
  "45419": "Is the imp altogether evil?",
  "45420": "In this new revolution thus established forever, who shall decide which is the sun and which is the moon?",
  "45421": "Of THEMSELVES?",
  "45422": "What are you saying to me?",
  "45423": "What is yonder?",
  "45424": "When did you lie, the last time or now?",
  "45425": "Did he live his life again in every detail of desire, temptation, and surrender during that supreme moment of complete knowledge?",
  "45426": "Did you see him?",
  "45427": "What prompted me then to disturb the memory of the buried dead?",
  "45428": "How shall we destroy him?",
  "45429": "Am I not your mother also?",
  "45430": "Why didn't you bring her?",
  "45431": "And the bridegroom?",
  "45432": "What are young men to rocks and mountains?",
  "45433": "Wot did I say?",
  "45434": "I am her father, am I not?",
  "45435": "Going to be in town long?",
  "45436": "But when will that be?",
  "45437": "But what have I done to you?",
  "45438": "Yours is a long life to look back upon, sir?",
  "45439": "D'ye understand?",
  "45440": "Then it was you?",
  "45441": "Why have you come?",
  "45442": "And that we may dismiss you to the moor and the rainy night?",
  "45443": "Will it come off?",
  "45444": "Why is there so much negation and abnegation in your hearts?",
  "45445": "And is there any greater or keener pleasure than that of sensual love?",
  "45446": "You know the consequences of mixing them?",
  "45447": "When have I been hash, tell me?",
  "45448": "Did you think a gentleman would be likely to take any interest in you?",
  "45449": "But what reference has that to me?",
  "45450": "Couldn't you have sent her back?",
  "45451": "You were her first love?",
  "45452": "Who were they?",
  "45453": "Yet why a second venture try?",
  "45454": "Do you want him to be fond of you?",
  "45455": "Where would you go?",
  "45456": "What advantages had she?",
  "45457": "Well, how has all gone off?",
  "45458": "Do we pay no money?",
  "45459": "What weapon would he choose?",
  "45460": "Why did he not go on?",
  "45461": "What will you take for it?",
  "45462": "Anything for me?",
  "45463": "What is there more?",
  "45464": "Is your majesty satisfied to see the earl and the queen make their appearance at this meeting?",
  "45465": "What possessed you to tell those stories about my saddle, and the hats and boots, and all the rest of it?",
  "45466": "Perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him?",
  "45467": "Was I, then, not yet aware that what I felt, myself, for her, depended neither upon her actions nor upon my desires?",
  "45468": "Even as a man who rides a horse is called a horseman?",
  "45469": "Not to me, I hope?",
  "45470": "Has he any objection to make to them which would justify him in overturning them?",
  "45471": "A young gentleman, is he not?",
  "45472": "But have you reflected seriously?",
  "45473": "Is this your indifference, your uninteresting conversation?",
  "45474": "Then one may smoke on board?",
  "45475": "Why should not she be a maid of honor, as well as myself?",
  "45476": "What will come out of those three elements when I am no longer present to combine them?",
  "45477": "Stopping here?",
  "45478": "I needn't, but hadn't I better?",
  "45479": "Sed?",
  "45480": "Didn't you cheat at croquet?",
  "45481": "It appears then that the world judge correctly, why should you be ashamed of their favorable judgment?",
  "45482": "As princes of the blood, in fact?",
  "45483": "What, faithless?",
  "45484": "What else do you want?",
  "45485": "May I help you off with your helmet?",
  "45486": "Why has she been crying?",
  "45487": "What can they have done with him?",
  "45488": "Do you love me, then?",
  "45489": "Will they neither obey nor make room for those who will?",
  "45490": "At what point shall we expect the approach of danger?",
  "45491": "But shall not we, ourselves, the truth maintain?",
  "45492": "My dear, do you see?",
  "45493": "But, after all, what is this metaphor called a crown, or rather what is monarchy?",
  "45494": "Is the aggregate power of the general government greater than ought to have been vested in it?",
  "45495": "Do you doubt them?",
  "45496": "Would you take a creature that has not a groat in the world?",
  "45497": "And that other gentleman?",
  "45498": "What would your excellency like to eat?",
  "45499": "How much do a king git?",
  "45500": "How many times?",
  "45501": "Why should she not be his?",
  "45502": "It doesn't matter, does it?",
  "45503": "Why didn't you write, my dear, and say you were coming?",
  "45504": "How do you maintain discipline among your men?",
  "45505": "And are you going to have no breakfast or dinner today?",
  "45506": "You won't tell?",
  "45507": "What make do you like?",
  "45508": "Where are you going, old fellow?",
  "45509": "What is the bridge for?",
  "45510": "You think I was concerned in the plot which brought about the rupture, do you not?",
  "45511": "Who was by him at night?",
  "45512": "Fit, I hope?",
  "45513": "Less than two minutes?",
  "45514": "Nor lay before your eyes what afflictions you yourselves have undergone?",
  "45515": "Mind?",
  "45516": "Suppose, then, a man speak an idle word, and die suddenly, before he has time to repent and confess his sin, will he be lost everlastingly?",
  "45517": "You were also married before you had this wife?",
  "45518": "Was the cause of death mentioned?",
  "45519": "The little princess?",
  "45520": "And that door is locked?",
  "45521": "Yes, or no?",
  "45522": "Found what?",
  "45523": "Why do you give the poor fellow no hope?",
  "45524": "Ah, what have you done to me?",
  "45525": "But what in the name of goodness could provoke you to tempt your fate so long?",
  "45526": "Has such and such a perfume done anything for me?",
  "45527": "You want big things that you can make your teeth meet in?",
  "45528": "Why did you tell me those things?",
  "45529": "I am not exempt, and ask now, shall I tend the herds?",
  "45530": "Can it be used against me?",
  "45531": "Where have you hurt yourself?",
  "45532": "Isn't it true there's something good and sweet in her?",
  "45533": "Could you believe in the existence of such a colossal dunce?",
  "45534": "Did such a being exist?",
  "45535": "But had he told his master?",
  "45536": "Wherein do the principles of scientific management differ essentially from those of ordinary management?",
  "45537": "Hasn't she sat up with you a good many nights, lately, mamma?",
  "45538": "How's his heart?",
  "45539": "But what's in this chest?",
  "45540": "Quite a big girl, I expect?",
  "45541": "You think not?",
  "45542": "Did I shoot straight, nurse?",
  "45543": "Agnes, shall I tell you what about?",
  "45544": "Explained nothing?",
  "45545": "And my position with regard to money?",
  "45546": "What's got into the beast?",
  "45547": "What colour?",
  "45548": "What's the meaning of this, madame?",
  "45549": "Have you a heart?",
  "45550": "Don't I know she wouldn't?",
  "45551": "You find it so?",
  "45552": "I mean, what makes them so shiny?",
  "45553": "Why, in a word, by thus speaking, do you prevent me from being frank in my turn?",
  "45554": "Can you prove that they aim at my crown?",
  "45555": "Whither are you leading us?",
  "45556": "Are you hungry?",
  "45557": "Give the little lad some more?",
  "45558": "Who caused you to suppose so?",
  "45559": "And in what did all this training end?",
  "45560": "Can it be me?",
  "45561": "But may I ask you one question?",
  "45562": "Went off to die?",
  "45563": "So he has not left his new address?",
  "45564": "I shall?",
  "45565": "My schemes, my labours, and my hopes be vain?",
  "45566": "And what do you mean to do?",
  "45567": "Sally with you too?",
  "45568": "Reader, were you ever present at the examination of a criminal?",
  "45569": "Is there not sad stuff?",
  "45570": "Could you take me away?",
  "45571": "What's brewing?",
  "45572": "Where and why are you going, when you might remain here?",
  "45573": "Shall you be glad to see him?",
  "45574": "Is it as your leader says?",
  "45575": "Schon fleissig?",
  "45576": "How did she bear it?",
  "45577": "Do you truly love me?",
  "45578": "What answer was possible to such stupid complimenting?",

  "45981": "How much does the proprietor increase the utility of his tenant's products?",
  "45982": "You've never worked at anything like this before, have you?",
  "45983": "Did you see us?",
  "45984": "But who could ever repay half the debt we owe you?",
  "45985": "Could he have thrown down the statue after he'd stripped the corpse?",
  "45986": "Shall we say in one hour's time?",
  "45987": "First of all, what did you see?",
  "45988": "Why, where ever did you go?",
  "45989": "You mean the rascals?",
  "45990": "Is it really calling us?",
  "45991": "Do they not think, they will have their own ends, and be truer to themselves, than to them?",
  "45992": "What humour's this?",
  "45993": "How about when you lose?",
  "45994": "But how about the new orbit in which we are moving?",
  "45995": "Shall I lead the way?",
  "45996": "Where was the poor devil to go?",
  "45997": "Would they not willingly sacrifice a little gift in order to obtain everlasting life?",
  "45998": "Where else could he have put it?",
  "45999": "Won't, if he has the chance, turn on me?",
  "46000": "Why are you explaining?",
  "46001": "Why how do you know?",
  "46002": "Well, did he?",
  "46003": "What the deuce have you done with yourself this last month?",
  "46004": "Why should we load ourselves with a useless burden?",
  "46005": "Had he, beneath the childish face, already recognized the passionate, proud woman?",
  "46006": "What is the reward?",
  "46007": "Why, why, why, are there no harbours of refuge for grown men who have not yet lost them?",
  "46008": "To what good?",
  "46009": "Do you know why I came clear out here afoot?",
  "46010": "Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?",
  "46011": "Is he dead?",
  "46012": "Look here, captain, to speak candidly, do you mean to say that there is anything marvelous in the occurrence?",
  "46013": "What was his purpose?",
  "46014": "There were brave men among them, but of what use was courage when their weapons were powerless against the monster?",
  "46015": "Have you any witness on't?",
  "46016": "Is it a bargain?",
  "46017": "And in the common way of his business does he not expect to be paid for his pictures?",
  "46018": "Who is this youth?",
  "46019": "Not named?",
  "46020": "He hain't been a sittin' so all day, has he?",
  "46021": "And where is your young master?",
  "46022": "How can we truly open the doors, and set free the full genius of our people?",
  "46023": "This what?",
  "46024": "We will go up now, shall we?",
  "46025": "But, it will be asked again, can we on these grounds, admit the existence of a wise and omnipotent author of the world?",
  "46026": "You have taken them away?",
  "46027": "Save it?",
  "46028": "To do with you, my lord?",
  "46029": "What boots it to deplore?",
  "46030": "How do you manage yours?",
  "46031": "What other dreadful things may happen, who can tell?",
  "46032": "How now, what noise is that?",
  "46033": "What is that house, then?",
  "46034": "Did he cut you out?",
  "46035": "You want to know the crime of which you are accused?",
  "46036": "How could we both be deceived?",
  "46037": "How was her girl to have guarded herself from a love so unfortunate, or have avoided the rock on which her vessel had been shipwrecked?",
  "46038": "Do you notice anything about the arrangement of the lamps?",
  "46039": "Can it establish a maximum?",
  "46040": "You take a roundabout way, then, to inform me that I am very ill?",
  "46041": "Shall I myself really have to say it to him?",
  "46042": "What other case?",
  "46043": "Is there any news of game afoot?",
  "46044": "What does it matter to you?",
  "46045": "Surprised you, didn't I?",
  "46046": "Nice animal for a pleasure party, wasn't it?",
  "46047": "How much is so applied?",
  "46048": "Why do I find it so hard to breathe?",
  "46049": "Ye must tell us more, whether our dear friends at home be of good cheer?",
  "46050": "Did you find poison, or a dagger, that you look so mournful now?",
  "46051": "What do you think of that plan?",
  "46052": "Do you not feel that?",
  "46053": "Besides, are they worse than others, these whom you call savages?",
  "46054": "You believe, then, the attack will be renewed?",
  "46055": "But why should you?",
  "46056": "What was this grand, eternal pageant to which he had yearned from his childhood up, and in which he could never take part?",
  "46057": "Will nothing alter your decision?",
  "46058": "Were you hit?",
  "46059": "Can you tell me anything about the matter?",
  "46060": "Where did you meet him?",
  "46061": "By what constraint doth the high stoop to the low?",
  "46062": "What was it that opened it?",
  "46063": "And what have we to oppose to them?",
  "46064": "I suppose you work till late?",
  "46065": "Can ye restore to us the beloved dead?",
  "46066": "Shall my silly heart be pined 'Cause I see a woman kind?",

  "46068": "So you knew me all the time, from the first moment I came into the room?",
  "46069": "From what, they asked, could his dissatisfaction arise?",
  "46070": "Is this arrangement satisfactory?",
  "46071": "Are you well?",
  "46072": "Couldn't you and I camp out in this house for the night?",
  "46073": "Where are you speaking from?",
  "46074": "What need to say that?",
  "46075": "What eye could penetrate into the tower of darkness?",
  "46076": "Has the ministry resigned?",
  "46077": "Am I not ready speak de too moshe?",
  "46078": "But how shall we gain the bottom of the sea?",
  "46079": "But suppose they come unarmed?",
  "46080": "But what was she doing?",
  "46081": "Was it from the cold?",
  "46082": "You will not, eh?",
  "46083": "Where should we be going, but home?",
  "46084": "Going home?",
  "46085": "But even apart from that?",
  "46086": "He won't, won't he?",
  "46087": "How is it, then?",
  "46088": "It would be terrible if we all yielded to it, wouldn't it?",
  "46089": "Of what consequence was this to them?",
  "46090": "What do they matter to you?",
  "46091": "And the work?",
  "46092": "How can you act this way, dearest?",
  "46093": "What other matters?",
  "46094": "Do you hear?",
  "46095": "How is it that a fatal organization, the organization of humanity, is adventitious, contradictory, full of tumult and catastrophes?",
  "46096": "Shall we not know it?",
  "46097": "What, indeed?",
  "46098": "Guilty?",
  "46099": "What, he had done you the honor to remain here?",
  "46100": "How shall you all fear death if you all know what your friend does not know that he knows?",
  "46101": "Who is that?",
  "46102": "And how long can he rest at the end of his journey?",
  "46103": "You were trying to guess that?",
  "46104": "Cannot you go to the river and drink your fill from the stream?",
  "46105": "Why on earth should two men write a letter in such a fashion?",
  "46106": "Wilfully?",
  "46107": "How long have you been here?",
  "46108": "Or stars and strings?",
  "46109": "An't you?",
  "46110": "Why can't I die now?",
  "46111": "You do not?",
  "46112": "Who could fully describe even five minutes of it?",
  "46113": "You want to take my father FROM me?",
  "46114": "Why should I refuse her whom I bear in heart?",
  "46115": "Who's a child?",
  "46116": "How can I possibly treat these poor fellows, who are of some good, at all events, otherwise than as a councilor of parliament?",
  "46117": "And how about a tour abroad?",
  "46118": "Are you mad, you wretch?",
  "46119": "And what is his rank and proper name?",
  "46120": "But can we expect such a king, or, for that is the material point, can we expect a lineal series of such kings?",
  "46121": "How did you get such a huge huge head?",
  "46122": "Was I resigned?",
  "46123": "And you think if I marry, it will be snub?",
  "46124": "Their complexion?",
  "46125": "I will be?",
  "46126": "A good cause might turn the scale with me, for may not I too be of an exceptional brain, congenitally?",
  "46127": "What did you take then at any other?",
  "46128": "Were there many of them?",
  "46129": "How did you escape?",
  "46130": "Will you now comply with my request?",
  "46131": "And the world, you think, would be none the poorer?",
  "46132": "You don't mind admitting that, I suppose?",
  "46133": "Who can tell them where their father is?",
  "46134": "For how is it probable that he would have been tender of his life, when he was so bitter against his memory?",
  "46135": "And why didn't mamma speak to me about him?",
  "46136": "Is it to be some panel of philosophers, some fancied posterity, or some other outside authority?",
  "46137": "Could he not feel that letters, eloquence, philosophy, were all degraded in his degradation?",
  "46138": "Got a cigaroot?",
  "46139": "In love with me?",
  "46140": "What is it, then?",
  "46141": "Some good fortune?",
  "46142": "And meantime?",
  "46143": "But am I not too cold with him?",
  "46144": "Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a lie?",
  "46145": "When do you cease to work?",
  "46146": "Following me?",
  "46147": "What do you here, fellows?",
  "46148": "How will you group the words together according to your new interpretation?",
  "46149": "So much frankness, do you say?",
  "46150": "A big P with a flourish above it, E and N smaller?",
  "46151": "Have you anything to add?",
  "46152": "Yet, after all, who would not envy him?",
  "46153": "Do you?",
  "46154": "Did he still need her, or she him?",
  "46155": "What will it be when he has grown up?",
  "46156": "What am I to do with a stone?",
  "46157": "He was wrong, then?",
  "46158": "But will you let me speak a word or two with you in private?",
  "46159": "When, how, and by what title did they obtain this privilege?",
  "46160": "Morrel?",
  "46161": "What is it you call him?",
  "46162": "Could it ever be?",
  "46163": "Would he be so lost to propriety as to marry her before the year was out?",
  "46164": "Do they think we're dogs?",
  "46165": "Yes, she loved him, or else how could that have happened which had happened?",
  "46166": "Does not the cone of the shadow cast by the earth extend beyond the moon?",
  "46167": "And must it not be looked upon as a sort of warrant for such actions, if I stay after this?",
  "46168": "Isn't it all the same?",
  "46169": "Would he say dat?",
  "46170": "Was it not wrong?",
  "46171": "You think, then, that I may rely on the count's promises?",
  "46172": "Mamma, why shouldn't father come with us?",
  "46173": "At your house?",
  "46174": "He was awfully rich, wasn't he, mother?",
  "46175": "Had he, indeed, been permitted to see a satyr at home?",
  "46176": "In search of what?",
  "46177": "I have no doubt of it, but are these your only reasons for this sudden fancy?",
  "46178": "Do you recognize me at all?",
  "46179": "Expected?",
  "46180": "And in the meanwhile?",
  "46181": "Why did you shake your head?",
  "46182": "Wouldn't you like to go to such a beautiful city as that when you die?",
  "46183": "And what good can you do her?",
  "46184": "Who is there?",
  "46185": "And to what part of it?",
  "46186": "She said she was not your wife?",
  "46187": "Can't you understand why?",
  "46188": "How are you going to get him down?",
  "46189": "And these things I see suddenly, what mean they?",
  "46190": "Why did she not let me know sooner?",
  "46191": "Because of the numerous court decisions of that character?",
  "46192": "You are a hypocrite, too, are you?",
  "46193": "Then why should this be so?",
  "46194": "Could he not escape from his little house?",
  "46195": "And is it finished?",
  "46196": "Quoy de ceux qui naturellement se changent en loups, en juments, et puis encores en hommes?",
  "46197": "Who comes here?",
  "46198": "And your police?",
  "46199": "Isn't it fun?",
  "46200": "What signified that disguise?",
  "46201": "But the grave question was, ought she to do this?",
  "46202": "What are you up to?",
  "46203": "What word, then, can be found to describe the days which they occupy in descending?",
  "46204": "Well, and is that all?",
  "46205": "Our hero commanded the galley?",
  "46206": "Then you do not fear to follow?",
  "46207": "ESPANOL?",
  "46208": "Is this one of the nine comforts of matrimony?",
  "46209": "And who made him my master?",
  "46210": "And how will you do that?",
  "46211": "Why should it?",
  "46212": "But what then?",
  "46213": "What envy would hinder him?",
  "46214": "Danglars?",
  "46215": "Your husband isn't in the house, I suppose?",
  "46216": "The death of your prince?",
  "46217": "Whither should I ride but to the court?",
  "46218": "And the flies?",
  "46219": "From ME?",
  "46220": "Does not his appearance speak for him?",
  "46221": "What is it, then?",
  "46222": "Who'll get there first?",
  "46223": "Was cupidity, strengthened by habit, to be laid asleep by a few fine sentences about virtue and union?",
  "46224": "But you will be careful, won't you?",
  "46225": "Nothing, aunt?",
  "46226": "Isn't it lucky we found it?",
  "46227": "Then why harm anyone?",
  "46228": "The good of mankind?",
  "46229": "Am I pale?",
  "46230": "Does he resemble either of these two passengers?",
  "46231": "But the work?",
  "46232": "But those who see the absolute and eternal and immutable may be said to know, and not to have opinion only?",
  "46233": "Does the reasoning strike yo as being faulty?",
  "46234": "Or perhaps you may be intending to undertake some sort of employment?",
  "46235": "Regiment cut up rough, think you?",
  "46236": "Were they asked?",
  "46237": "Francois?",
  "46238": "Then you've come from my house, have you?",
  "46239": "Who is that secret lover, I ask, of whom, at least, most of the relatives know nothing?",
  "46240": "Where is the gentleman to whom you are engaged?",
  "46241": "Didn't I tell you that?",
  "46242": "I suppose you remember him?",
  "46243": "What reparation can you make for this?",
  "46244": "Which has happened to you?",
  "46245": "What is democracy?",
  "46246": "Nor hear, nor regard ourselves?",
  "46247": "Are you in good spirits?",
  "46248": "Can it then be a matter of surprise, that boys become selfish and vicious who are thus shut out from social converse?",
  "46249": "Of nostril clear?",
  "46250": "Do you expect company?",
  "46251": "How often am I to say the same thing?",
  "46252": "As for themselves, what can they depend on in this their opposition, when the greatest part of their city is already taken?",
  "46253": "How can you leave us?",
  "46254": "And your mother?",
  "46255": "Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive?",
  "46256": "What's that cry?",
  "46257": "But what I want to know, mister, is how the coppers know these things?",
  "46258": "But if, uneasy at our absence, he would venture to come?",
  "46259": "Did you tell him that it was the last door at the end of the corridor, on the right?",
  "46260": "How could I come till I knew what had befallen you?",
  "46261": "What place is that, the falcon?",
  "46262": "Ye say it is the good cause which halloweth even war?",
  "46263": "Did ye ever see the like of that cloud?",
  "46264": "What's going on now?",
  "46265": "You had been drinking as well as begging last night, had you not?",
  "46266": "There, will you let me go?",
  "46267": "Next, if her present servant love her?",
  "46268": "Does he say it in his general sweeping charge?",
  "46269": "And in what manner ought it to attend to them ?",
  "46270": "So, old acquaintance, said my master, again have I met you in this place?",
  "46271": "How can I explain myself?",
  "46272": "Have we lost faith?",
  "46273": "Don't you think it may be a little premature?",
  "46274": "Why did I do it?",
  "46275": "But why do you think we shall be safe?",
  "46276": "What then remains?",
  "46277": "Ought I to spare myself more than others?",
  "46278": "Is she faithful to him?",
  "46279": "All day?",
  "46280": "Come now, that comical joke?",
  "46281": "What have ye done to surpass man?",
  "46282": "Why should I witness embarrassments which I cannot relieve, and mysteries which I offend you even by attempting to penetrate?",
  "46283": "Will we ourselves be at peace?",
  "46284": "Why was it so?",
  "46285": "Who gave them a right to decide that it is a sin?",
  "46286": "Will you go, dearest?",
  "46287": "Well, dearies, how have you got on today?",
  "46288": "Only that?",
  "46289": "Harpooner?",
  "46290": "Do I not?",
  "46291": "But what in the name of all that is wonderful made the fellow leave it behind?",
  "46292": "Won't that be fine?",
  "46293": "Do you think yourself lost?",
  "46294": "What'd I want to kick 'm for?",

  "46305": "How many are there in all?",
  "46306": "Doe we not see fooles laugh at heaven?",
  "46307": "Or had you intended any more serious consequence?",
  "46308": "To ascend high mountains to tempt the tempter?",
  "46309": "She persists in denying to you that she saw, or has ever seen, anything?",
  "46310": "How can you contrive to write so even?",
  "46311": "What do you call some time, now?",
  "46312": "Out of pity, eh?",
  "46313": "And how, if I decide?",
  "46314": "Whence comes that short sigh?",
  "46315": "May I accompany you?",
  "46316": "How can a sheep dog work a flock of sheep unless he can bite occasionally as well as bark?",

  "46330": "Now, whilst they were thus busy about me, the fire triumphed, never ask how?",
  "46331": "What am I to dodge her for?",
  "46332": "Now, what do you say?",
  "46333": "That?",
  "46334": "Wherefore did you not apply, then, madame, to the first person you saw from us?",
  "46335": "What would the abbe please to have?",

  "46351": "Biddy, don't you hear me?",
  "46352": "How could one help understanding?",
  "46353": "Could you wish that we should be deprived of this new instance of your genius and accomplishments?",
  "46354": "Have I your permission?",
  "46355": "How, then, can we make much out of this part of the territory?",
  "46356": "Had not votes made war and emancipated millions?",
  "46357": "What a question?",
  "46358": "You acknowledge, of course, that you owe this sum to him?",

  "46898": "Who's she?",
  "46899": "Where and when have you seen me trifle with a friend's heart and a king's life?",
  "46900": "Even when no one can hear us, may I, by no syllable, by none, not the slightest intimation, remind you of our love?",
  "46901": "Yes, it is a child, but who brought it here?",
  "46902": "Has he solved the antinomy of the division of labor, perpetual cause of the workingman's ignorance, immorality, and poverty?",
  "46903": "Eh?",
  "46904": "Have you made anything out of the tangle?",
  "46905": "And you wouldn't leave them any?",

  "46923": "What kind of spectacle would its hidden hemisphere present to our terrestrial spheroid?",
  "46924": "Would you have doomed me, at any time, to the frost and blight that have hardened and spoiled me?",
  "46925": "Couldn't this have been an accident?",
  "46926": "They don't look bad, do they?",
  "46927": "A secret ambassador?",
  "46928": "Do you not constantly argue that this is not the right place to oppose it?",
  "46929": "Then you have some secret hope to buoy you up and please you with whispers of the future?",
  "46930": "But where are you hurrying now?",
  "46931": "Do you mean to pretend that you didn't know it would be injurious to her to meet you here week after week?",

  "46936": "What have you done about it?",
  "46937": "What could he get by that?",
  "46938": "Do you know whom she reminds me of?",
  "46939": "The accusation?",
  "46940": "Now I ask, what idea do we form of these bodies or objects, to which we suppose solidity to belong?",

  "46942": "Will he not utterly hate a lie?",
  "46943": "I had the best of it this time?",
  "46944": "Can you understand the happiness I get out of my absinthe?",
  "46945": "How know you that?",

  "46963": "Don't you think it must be very uncomfortable to be married to a man whose first wife was perfect?",
  "46964": "Now, my ladies, you strike him not?",
  "46965": "What is the matter, D'Artagnan?",
  "46966": "Is that the idea?",

  "46972": "Did ever any one see such a fine piece of beef so completely ruined?",
  "46973": "Yea, is it so bad as that?",
  "46974": "Who does me this?",
  "46975": "And people think it so?",
  "46976": "What have I done that you should pass on me so severe a sentence?",
  "46977": "Did the gentleman give a name?",
  "46978": "Were they then so soon to lose him whom they had snatched from an agonizing death?",
  "46979": "And what shall you do?",
  "46980": "But why so?",
  "46981": "He was disposed to interfere too much, was he?",
  "46982": "Hot and moist?",
  "46983": "Any guerrillas?",

  "46992": "Had it struck on a submerged rock, or on an enormous wreck?",
  "46993": "But what if it all had been lost?",
  "46994": "Why had that man taken to flight on the arrival of the police, instead of entering a complaint?",
  "46995": "If it isn't, what are we here for?",
  "46996": "But the light?",
  "46997": "And what happens?",
  "46998": "Kindly?",
  "46999": "But what step would you propose to me?",
  "47000": "Why should you want to spite her?",
  "47001": "Don't you see, my boy, that these things are debits?",
  "47002": "Can men refuse to be pleased with words of gentle advice?",
  "47003": "And just actions cause justice, and unjust actions cause injustice?",

  "47009": "An advice?",
  "47010": "No one?",
  "47011": "Oh, but can't you have the kindness to take me in?",
  "47012": "Is it in this mode that the spirit of mutual support and common effort for the common good, is to be cultivated?",
  "47013": "You will not do that?",
  "47014": "And there, don't you see?",
  "47015": "Did you say?",

  "47054": "Have you heard?",
  "47055": "Have the humanistic studies not given to him, as to so many of his contemporaries, a distinctive mental bent?",
  "47056": "What interest, let me ask, have the people in the settlement of this question?",
  "47057": "And how should I, having been a hunter all my life?",
  "47058": "Why, what's the matter with you?",
  "47059": "And why, if you knew me, do you let me die?",
  "47060": "But what is to be done?",
  "47061": "You do not doubt that, I hope?",
  "47062": "Is it interesting?",
  "47063": "Eureka?",
  "47064": "What do they call it, that which maketh them proud?",
  "47065": "Why do you think so?",
  "47066": "What is it, dear one?",
  "47067": "Could I retract my word, and take upon myself the responsibility of compromising the future of my companions?",
  "47068": "And is it any better as it is?",
  "47069": "Answer, what?",
  "47070": "But is there no danger from the bite?",

  "47571": "Now what?",
  "47572": "What did he see?",
  "47573": "Is it not the rushing of the wolves you have mentioned?",
  "47574": "For what?",
  "47575": "Should he impose his galleys on those two dazzling children, or should he consummate his irremediable engulfment by himself?",

  "47605": "Won't he drown?",
  "47606": "How is it pointing?",
  "47607": "Change places with him, and would you have been looked at by those blue eyes as he was, and commiserated by that agitated face as he was?",
  "47608": "Is that your conclusion, lieutenant?",
  "47609": "What qualities have you, my friend, which would make your services so valuable?",
  "47610": "And may we not say the same of all things?",
  "47611": "And then if we look at things from a still more lofty point of view, why do we speak of civil war?",
  "47612": "Is it to tell the maids to leave their master's business and cook dinner for them?",

  "47614": "Where did her dignity come from?",
  "47615": "Do you know what the question is here?",
  "47616": "Why, what harm was there in that?",
  "47617": "Do you really mean you had ever rented it?",
  "47618": "You will let me know?",
  "47619": "Is commerce of importance to national wealth?",

  "47627": "Why shouldn't I get up and try that chair of yours?",
  "47628": "Does his island produce him such a revenue?",
  "47629": "Can he give any definition of it, that will not be the same with that of causation?",

  "47639": "But what was the nature of this emotion?",
  "47640": "War?",
  "47641": "For if he be capable of attending his brother to the mount, why is he not made prefect of the city?",
  "47642": "Where is he to go?",

  "47650": "Lyon?",
  "47651": "Why, what?",
  "47652": "What more is to be said?",
  "47653": "You would, would you?",
  "47654": "What do you mean by special privileges?",
  "47655": "How shall I dare to come, who know no good thing of myself, whence I might be able to presume?",
  "47656": "And pray, what sort of a road may that be?",
  "47657": "I?",
  "47658": "And what do those girls do?",
  "47659": "Now did I say anything of the sort?",
  "47660": "Why should I spare him?",

  "47667": "What would happen in the desolate darkness?",
  "47668": "You don't remember hittin' anything when you fell over, do you?",

  "47709": "You, who have arranged your infernal plans, and removed the beverages with a talent and precision almost miraculous?",
  "47710": "Surely you must feel how easy it is for you to insult me?",
  "47711": "My name?",
  "47712": "Where's the policeman?",
  "47713": "Doesn't it destroy all our spontaneity, all our instincts?",

  "47750": "What are you crying about?",
  "47751": "What crime, then, have my eyes committed, if their glance but follows my desire?",
  "47752": "Can a man so important and necessary to society be also my husband?",
  "47753": "And where are those treasures which may be sufficient for your undertakings?",
  "47754": "I ask you if you know any other living man who would make such a statement?",
  "47755": "See?",
  "47756": "Where did you get him?",
  "47757": "Your part of the country, I think?",

  "47779": "Do you think differently?",
  "47780": "By me?",
  "47781": "Well, have you seen everything?",
  "47782": "Was it really only an idea, or was it the interpretation of a profound yearning?",
  "47783": "How should he close again?",
  "47784": "What prince?",
  "47785": "Is that, sir, a lawful impediment?",
  "47786": "Haven't you seen a child?",
  "47787": "Is this man your servant?",

  "47792": "Tiutkin, coiffeur?",
  "47793": "Ah, how can I express it?",
  "47794": "Does he arrive at a clear conclusion?",
  "47795": "Why not ten years hence?",
  "47796": "Is the infant that stretches out its hands toward a bright object conscious of a desire to possess it?",
  "47797": "How did the star get into the icon?",
  "47798": "Why wouldn't he have it?",
  "47799": "But who knows whether I shall have time?",
  "47800": "Why then shall we spend the public money in such employment?",
  "47801": "What sort of an army do you rely on?",
  "47802": "Who knows?",
  "47803": "And what is the end?",
  "47804": "Ayrton here?",
  "47805": "How do you suppose it got there?",
  "47806": "What, then, after labor, is the primary cause of the multiplication of wealth and the skill of laborers?",
  "47807": "But we'll be still, shall we?",
  "47808": "What's the use worrying right now?",
  "47809": "Can a chap catch a likeness flying along a rail road?",
  "47810": "But is this a satisfactory method to treat a grave matter of faith, coming down to us from the olden times?",

  "47816": "There is a drive, then?",
  "47817": "What, a'ready?",
  "47818": "Would you like to have some?",
  "47819": "And where the devil have you come from, sir?",
  "47820": "But what if you don't hit?",
  "47821": "Then I was right?",
  "47822": "But the trunks?",
  "47823": "What ails you, my dearest father?",
  "47824": "So you admire this kind of beauty, do you?",
  "47825": "What shall it be?",
  "47826": "Know you again?",
  "47827": "Would you kindly explain for whose benefit you intend them?",
  "47828": "Isn't it done every day by all the masters about?",
  "47829": "And when the world was ended, what was there to show for it?",
  "47830": "Shall I send word to him as coming from you?",

  "47844": "Well, what happened then?",
  "47845": "But, it may be asked, did all this happen in exactly the same way in which it is told here?",
  "47846": "How can I retrace today the strange steps of my obsession?",
  "47847": "Of whom does my friend speak?",
  "47848": "Of what use, then, is the communication you have made?",
  "47849": "When shall we look upon his like again?",
  "47850": "How is he to know the action of a poison?",
  "47851": "Had they not all, by some hook or crook, done better for themselves than he had done?",

  "49156": "Why, do you think I should be any happier if I were to feel disturbed about the excavations you tell me of?",
  "49157": "But how am I to climb?",
  "49158": "What is your love to mine?",
  "49159": "Love covers a multitude of sins, and of whom could you ask more freely than of him?",
  "49160": "Did you observe that man's eyes while he was speaking to us?",
  "49161": "And who is she, this woman that you want to see?",
  "49162": "Still, are they going to do it shortly?",
  "49163": "What do you mean, master of mine?",
  "49164": "And of what other trees?",
  "49165": "May we not conjecture that they belonged to the people who resided in the town, and who were victorious in the engagement?",
  "49166": "Could a man be born to a more perfect glory?",
  "49167": "You are vexed?",
  "49168": "You'll not say anything about it at home, will you?",
  "49169": "To our journey's end?",
  "49170": "Don't you want supper?",
  "49171": "To what unexpected good fortune, to what accident, am I to ascribe this happy meeting?",
  "49172": "How did it fare with the missions in these days of woe and terror?",
  "49173": "And how is everybody?",
  "49174": "Perhaps you'd like to spend a couple of shillings or so, in a bottle of currant wine by and by, up in the bedroom?",
  "49175": "With what object?",
  "49176": "Or is it the matter?",
  "49177": "Do you wish a step, or some place in the government?",
  "49178": "Would it not be better to rest now?",
  "49179": "But what then?",
  "49180": "Am I right or not?",
  "49181": "Why impossible?",
  "49182": "It is agreed, then, that I carry you off with me?",
  "49183": "You don't think one needs the EXPERIENCE of having been married?",
  "49184": "Quite seriously?",
  "49185": "Who should prevent you?",
  "49186": "The vastness of this word?",
  "49187": "Whose horse is waiting at your gate?",
  "49188": "Oh, why should I injure a man both worthy and innocent, who has only done me services and honour?",
  "49189": "Why did you light the thirsty lamp?",
  "49190": "Would he be in time to rescue?",
  "49191": "How did he come to be there?",
  "49192": "Why aren't I good enough to attend her filthy brat?",
  "49193": "The meeting?",
  "49194": "Can't read it?",
  "49195": "Whence doth this aspect horrible proceed?",
  "49196": "Will your majesty deign to excuse me?",
  "49197": "Shall we say it is because we have won an empire?",
  "49198": "What do you talk about?",
  "49199": "Or why should not all the three walk abreast?",
  "49200": "Don't you know how one longs to have something to do for some one who belongs to one?",
  "49201": "And is it so, maidy?",
  "49202": "Were they hungry?",
  "49203": "Won't you stay?",
  "49204": "Has he committed suicide?",
  "49205": "Do your ears tell you that they have traced our retreat?",
  "49206": "What made you sit in such an awkward position?",
  "49207": "Why shouldn't we both be married, instead of sitting through the long winter evenings by our solitary firesides?",
  "49208": "You think me rather parsimonious, don't you?",
  "49209": "Why are you so very shy, and so very sombre?",
  "49210": "Would any one of us be here if we weren't paupers?",
  "49211": "What other initiative, what greater authority, do you ask?",
  "49212": "Why do you serve in this capacity?",
  "49213": "How do you like it?",
  "49214": "What month?",
  "49215": "More than in other years?",
  "49216": "But could he be sure that this was all that was to be said about this enigma, and that he should never arrive at a solution?",
  "49217": "Half a mile, you say?",
  "49218": "Has anything happened, ma'am?",
  "49219": "Where is the man who brought the letter?",
  "49220": "Whither am I going?",
  "49221": "Shall I have it, or shall I not?",
  "49222": "And all my limbs unbroken?",
  "49223": "Why did they?",
  "49224": "Do you know where we could get one?",
  "49225": "Well, and you want your fortune told?",
  "49226": "Was it his wife, or else as like her as any sister could be?",
  "49227": "Does that mean that all men have a right to all property?",
  "49228": "How could she tell where I had got the handkerchief?",
  "49229": "And can bear to have my morsel of bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my cup?",
  "49230": "One thing and another commit?",
  "49231": "Oh, isn't that too bad?",
  "49232": "What troops are these that seem to be passing through the wood?",
  "49233": "You'd never think it to look at me, would you?",
  "49234": "What shall I sing?",
  "49235": "What object could they have?",
  "49236": "And do you suppose she understands nothing?",
  "49237": "Could I have caused that girl's death and procreated this being?",
  "49238": "What do the women find so impressive in that little brat?",
  "49239": "Well, sir?",
  "49240": "And I must cross it with silver, I suppose?",
  "49241": "A letter?",
  "49242": "Whom follow?",
  "49243": "What means this profession of faith?",
  "49244": "His wife?",
  "49245": "What place is that?",
  "49246": "Is not this thing which you advise me to do a little cowardly?",
  "49247": "Who has paid adulation to the nation while claiming for it a sovereignty which it was incapable of exercising?",
  "49248": "Have you not wished to go?",
  "49249": "Died he of sickness or through treachery?",
  "49250": "Isn't this rather sudden?",
  "49251": "To how much?",
  "49252": "Why, why are people all balls of bitter dust?",
  "49253": "You tell me nothing?",
  "49254": "What means this?",
  "49255": "Who calls?",
  "49256": "Why should I deny it?",
  "49257": "What is the matter with them?",
  "49258": "Now, children, which is it to be?",
  "49259": "Is the doctrine warranted by FACTS?",
  "49260": "Then what will you do with me then?",
  "49261": "Can anyone grasp what such an offer meant at such a spot, made to a man who, to tell the truth, is very fond of a smoke after meals?",
  "49262": "From whom had they that information?",
  "49263": "Shall I ever see your sister?",
  "49264": "Then your duchess is still at the waters?",
  "49265": "Have you heard anything of the case?",
  "49266": "Do you wish to try to do so?",
  "49267": "After all, he said in his bitterness, what can a woman care about so much as house and furniture?",
  "49268": "What was his devotion worth to her?",
  "49269": "I suppose I could walk with the rest?",
  "49270": "But why waste more words on them?",
  "49271": "What was it fell last night from the evil moon?",
  "49272": "Well, then, I said, why couldn't she tell her husband to fetch a dog?",
  "49273": "Just as she was, in a manner, pretending to listen?",
  "49274": "Two words?",
  "49275": "It was he who told you to invite me to appear with these studs?",
  "49276": "And how were they treated?",
  "49277": "Do you bring me a message from the king, or have you made a bold hit, and wish me to take you again under my protection?",
  "49278": "Isn't it a terrible thing to die so young as that?",
  "49279": "How many times have we seen it?",
  "49280": "Well, then, what possessed you to go down there this time of night?",
  "49281": "And do you know who is his lieutenant?",
  "49282": "Did not you take heed, quoth he, a little before he opened his mouth to speak, what a shogging, shaking, and wagging his head did keep?",
  "49283": "I suppose that's what your humanity would suggest?",
  "49284": "And are you going away, then, really?",
  "49285": "Do you not know that you have been dead this long time?",
  "49286": "How long a delay do you wish for?",
  "49287": "Well, what will you give for it?",
  "49288": "What evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of your senses?",
  "49289": "But should you not interfere?",
  "49290": "It would trouble me sadly to make him unhappy, for I couldn't fall in love with the dear old fellow merely out of gratitude, could I?",
  "49291": "Where were thy senses?",
  "49292": "Mademoiselle, how could you believe that?",
  "49293": "Do you understand what the word pity means?",
  "49294": "You mean it makes you feel that you have nothing?",
  "49295": "But what about women?",
  "49296": "Besides, how could one land on the opposite bank among willows which would scuttle the boat, and with a flood of unknown extent?",
  "49297": "Have I, indeed, said anything you should answer with such a cruel remark?",
  "49298": "What hinders it?",
  "49299": "Would you care fer any one that took all those?",
  "49300": "You haven't breakfasted?",
  "49301": "So what have you done with it?",
  "49302": "You mean when a woman has children?",
  "49303": "What is there to surprise anyone in that?",
  "49304": "If I only had it here, wretch that I am, what more should we want?",
  "49305": "Well, monseigneur?",
  "49306": "Do you wish me to begin admiring the peoples?",
  "49307": "Do I not myself know that I am at this moment in want of a dozen pages, and that I am sick with cudgelling my brains to find them?",
  "49308": "Which do ye choose?",
  "49309": "Did you observe any one during the first act?",
  "49310": "Have you heard the news?",
  "49311": "And what IS this on my head?",
  "49312": "Why deceive us further?",
  "49313": "And by whom are you forbidden?",
  "49314": "Who has done this?",
  "49315": "And who was that man?",
  "49316": "What happened to you?",
  "49317": "What put her up to clearing out?",
  "49318": "To play blindman's bluff?",
  "49319": "Well, sire?",
  "49320": "Any answer?",
  "49321": "How do you do?",
  "49322": "You wouldn't like your relations to be starved, even if they were only third cousins, would you?",
  "49323": "And so, is it quite certain he is coming?",
  "49324": "If nobody were rich, who would employ the poor?",
  "49325": "And what do you expect the king to reply?",
  "49326": "But if she does?",
  "49327": "Where is he who could say it no?",
  "49328": "I have surely not been dreaming, have I?",
  "49329": "Shall we light a fire, so as to signal our presence on the coast?",
  "49330": "Do you think of dying, my lord?",
  "49331": "What does the poetry or the value of the ring signify?",
  "49332": "What do you believe, what do you KNOW?",
  "49333": "How's my poor brother?",
  "49334": "Is he so hard, then?",
  "49335": "Why did you come?",
  "49336": "Oh, mother, what is the matter?",
  "49337": "And what house is this?",
  "49338": "What, no second club?",
  "49339": "Will fish go down with them?",
  "49340": "May it not, theoretically, include as much of the universe as is known to man?",
  "49341": "Is it my affair?",
  "49342": "I, madame?",
  "49343": "Why should you go about the parish?",
  "49344": "Who is this ancient teacher or who is his prototype if he is an ideal being?",
  "49345": "What could those words mean?",
  "49346": "Did you never do any robbery in your life?",
  "49347": "What devil?",
  "49348": "Why are we less prompt to provide for our own safety than the rest of the citizens?",
  "49349": "I said, do you hear me?",
  "49350": "For what purpose?",
  "49351": "Is his hour past?",
  "49352": "Do you know of any other?",
  "49353": "For how, under different wills, should we find complete unity of ends?",
  "49354": "Did you ever see anything to equal it, as you steam away in the sunset?",
  "49355": "Were you thinking of your birth then?",
  "49356": "Look at a plant in the midst of its range, why does it not double or quadruple its numbers?",
  "49357": "Couldn't he have waited for the good season to increase his chances?",
  "49358": "Am I too heavy?",
  "49359": "Shall we agree to this plan, or not?",
  "49360": "Buy back your wheelbarrow?",
  "49361": "Do they begin by exciting the detestation of the very instruments of their intended usurpations?",
  "49362": "Up so early?",
  "49363": "Do I know you?",
  "49364": "His things and his bag are with him?",
  "49365": "Another shock, eh?",
  "49366": "Can I trust you?",
  "49367": "Other people's?",
  "49368": "And did you see her just now, as she spoke of her father?",
  "49369": "And fought?",
  "49370": "Was there no other who contributed?",
  "49371": "Under what obligation do I lie of making such an abuse of time?",
  "49372": "Could any other man express what they knew so well how to express in tones and in words?",
  "49373": "But what book is that next it?",
  "49374": "It surely cannot be you who made shoes for me at the l'ecole militaire?",
  "49375": "How must I do?",
  "49376": "But how, sir, said I, did you part?",
  "49377": "Where was the first lion?",
  "49378": "When didn't you?",
  "49379": "What is its name?",
  "49380": "That is, you mean that sin keeps him back?",
  "49381": "To whom was this letter addressed?",
  "49382": "Carlo, did I offer any violence?",
  "49383": "Couldn't stand it, eh?",
  "49384": "Who are your uncles and aunts?",
  "49385": "What was he saying yesterday?",
  "49386": "And do you think I ever shall?",
  "49387": "Why do you want me?",
  "49388": "I ask you what year is it?",
  "49389": "What sent you hither?",
  "49390": "Was such a thing ever heard of?",
  "49391": "What had she to do with the justice or injustice of other people?",
  "49392": "Which is it to be, death or life?",
  "49393": "Jule, you won't go, will you?",
  "49394": "How will they proceed?",
  "49395": "Not a cloud?",
  "49396": "What has that boy been about?",
  "49397": "Or any other time?",
  "49398": "Are they not already in the land?",
  "49399": "What did they want there?",
  "49400": "To which?",
  "49401": "The surface of a sphere?",
  "49402": "Are they happy?",
  "49403": "Is it a good road, and how far?",
  "49404": "And the lord chamberlain?",
  "49405": "Mayor?",
  "49406": "Had you ever any reason to complain of him?",
  "49407": "Will you promise me then to be at peace?",
  "49408": "A voyage?",
  "49409": "And they found the child?",
  "49410": "Yet what will the energy of true genius not effect?",
  "49411": "What is there to hinder?",
  "49412": "Is it a lonely farm?",
  "49413": "And can I play with him, too?",
  "49414": "Why do I want to go?",
  "49415": "What business, said she, had you to read my letter?",
  "49416": "Or, if it ought to give any, what are the different parts of education which it ought to attend to in the different orders of the people?",
  "49417": "Why don't he, in such a case, sell his horses, let his house, turn off his servants, and make a thorough reform at once?",
  "49418": "You don't mean to say you have forgotten that you promised to make half a dozen calls with me today?",
  "49419": "What time did he set off for town?",
  "49420": "And are you coming with us?",
  "49421": "When had that question been settled?",
  "49422": "Had he travelled?",
  "49423": "And why have you such an air of sadness aboard?",
  "49424": "And what has become of the business?",
  "49425": "Was it an instant of enchantment only or long hours and years and ages?",
  "49426": "Is the lady so very alarming?",
  "49427": "Your marriage?",
  "49428": "Won't you, young fellow?",
  "49429": "Your aunt?",
  "49430": "By means of what organ?",
  "49431": "What DOES the face matter?",
  "49432": "All of it?",
  "49433": "Is he lost, I wonder, in this desert?",
  "49434": "Can you enlighten me on that point?",
  "49435": "What makes her want to see ye?",
  "49436": "Do you mean to ask this girl to marry you?",
  "49437": "Are you quite well?",
  "49438": "And what this?",
  "49439": "Did not his land produce sufficient of everything?",
  "49440": "When did it break out?",
  "49441": "Why add up the elements of resistance and anarchy?",
  "49442": "And pray, if you are so good, who ventures to affirm that?",
  "49443": "What for?",
  "49444": "What are you thinking of doing?",
  "49445": "How could we live and where could we live?",
  "49446": "Is it so nice as all that?",
  "49447": "But what do I say?",
  "49448": "Or wasn't it meant for my ears?",
  "49449": "Whom does this belong to?",
  "49450": "Who are you, my good man?",
  "49451": "Do they think the prefect will be glad to dine down there under a tent like a gipsy?",
  "49452": "Had I dreamt?",
  "49453": "Why did she so lose courage?",
  "49454": "And can you not understand why I said fortune favours us?",
  "49455": "What's the use of living?",
  "49456": "Are you well and happy?",
  "49457": "What to do?",
  "49458": "Did the sun, which shone so brightly everywhere else, really fall upon him?",
  "49459": "What brings you here, dear heart?",
  "49460": "What were they now?",
  "49461": "I suppose you haven't got a brass farthing, have you?",
  "49462": "You understand what I say?",
  "49463": "Are they in safety?",
  "49464": "Sneezed, did you?",
  "49465": "I'm not?",
  "49466": "Have you forgotten that a son ought to love and honour his father and mother?",
  "49467": "Had the remembrance of her teaching utterly vanished, and the last trace of her maternal influence quite faded away?",
  "49468": "Don't you know the cawing crow lives five times as long as a man?",
  "49469": "What do you want with me?",
  "49470": "You are staying the whole evening, I hope?",
  "49471": "Why shouldn't she like him?",
  "49472": "What weight would that carry?",
  "49473": "Doesn't she look lovely?",
  "49474": "Good gracious, what noise is that?",
  "49475": "Have you seen the princess?",
  "49476": "Is it because there is no word tender enough to be your name?",
  "49477": "Won't you try and care for me a little?",
  "49478": "So you wanted to get away, my dear, did you?",
  "49479": "Did it not show that he comprehended his relations with her?",
  "49480": "What need of positive law where natural justice is, of itself, a sufficient restraint?",
  "49481": "But how was it settled between you, mamma?",
  "49482": "What means this?",
  "49483": "What is it that is strange?",
  "49484": "Coming in to have a short time?",
  "49485": "Do you reproach me?",
  "49486": "And what do you pick your teeth with, after devouring that fat goose?",
  "49487": "Had not his books taught him that he was a man?",
  "49488": "And will you mention to me the yearly sum which would repay you for managing these affairs which we have discussed together?",
  "49489": "What'll be over?",
  "49490": "But then, what are we here for?",
  "49491": "Why shouldn't I have them all to myself?",
  "49492": "You'll wait and wave your handkerchief when I get to that turn in the road?",
  "49493": "Two years ago, wasn't it?",
  "49494": "Now, what do you think the lawyer making the inquiries wants?",
  "49495": "You have?",
  "49496": "De qui?",
  "49497": "What was it, my dear?",
  "49498": "She was young, you say?",
  "49499": "His effect?",
  "49500": "What is life to you?",
  "49501": "Where are you living now?",
  "49502": "How can I tell whet ye say?",
  "49503": "Have they?",
  "49504": "Shall my messenger, in your name, tell your people to give in?",
  "49505": "And does he still tip you?",
  "49506": "If he forsakes his faith, how doth it profit you?",
  "49507": "Why do you do such a strange thing?",
  "49508": "Why did you think so?",
  "49509": "Does he say so now?",
  "49510": "And both should be in harmony?",
  "49511": "Why, you love him, do you not?",
  "49512": "I hope I am doing nothing wrong in asking it again?",
  "49513": "Had he spoken of himself, of himself as he was or wished to be?",
  "49514": "If he did not, what would she do?",
  "49515": "And ought not the same natures to have the same pursuits?",
  "49516": "What next?",
  "49517": "Won't you come to see mamma?",
  "49518": "Why did it happen?",
  "49519": "But our troop horses?",
  "49520": "Nay, tell me, how many histories are there filled with these marvels?",
  "49521": "It's likely, isn't it, then there would be two girls with a name like that?",
  "49522": "Do you mind my smoking?",
  "49523": "How, then, does this passion for gain, abandoned to itself, turn to the prejudice of society?",
  "49524": "If a kiss had been imprinted?",
  "49525": "Well, do you attend the function tonight?",
  "49526": "Whence the cause of this singular intoxication, the consequences of which might have been very disastrous?",
  "49527": "But they have wisdom, else what is the use of having died?",
  "49528": "Always a muddle?",
  "49529": "Have I given no testimony of my sincerity and of my passion?",
  "49530": "That's everything?",
  "49531": "Is this the same lemonade of which you partook?",
  "49532": "And what does he charge?",
  "49533": "But the horses?",
  "49534": "In summer?",
  "49535": "And what the devil was the matter with his head?",
  "49536": "Why do we love?",
  "49537": "And what do the rulers call the people?",
  "49538": "And how much was the residue?",
  "49539": "What do you think he replied?",
  "49540": "Or is it equally criminal in every body?",
  "49541": "Perhaps you think I shall abandon you, dear grandpapa, and that I shall forget you when I am married?",
  "49542": "What's coming next?",
  "49543": "Did your father speak of it?",
  "49544": "What was that noise?",
  "49545": "Your father breaks horses, don't he?",
  "49546": "What made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here?",
  "49547": "An old hag who said her son had the plague?",

  "50818": "HOW could he look at her with those clear, warm, waiting eyes, waiting for her, even now?",
  "50819": "And had the dark and wondrous island indeed faithfully guarded its precious secret?",
  "50820": "You mean you're staying here with your uncle, like a good boy?",

  "51348": "Are we at the end?",
  "51349": "Well, who doubts it?",
  "51350": "When did you find it out?",
  "51351": "Who, may I ask?",
  "51352": "Now, how had this noble rescue been accomplished?",
  "51353": "Seems a fate in it, don't there?",
  "51354": "Could it be done on horseback, think you?",
  "51355": "Don't you reckon I know who hid that money in that coffin?",

  "51385": "But what was that mangled shape lying over there among the sandbags?",
  "51386": "And you are, then, perfectly sure of our victory?",
  "51387": "Did my father that?",
  "51388": "How could the thing be possible?",

  "53535": "Is he safe?",
  "53536": "What were these villains after but money?",
  "53537": "And pretty?",
  "53538": "How came you here at all?",
  "53539": "Still in the wine trade?",
  "53540": "What is the good of reading, what is the good of learning anything, for just six months?",
  "53541": "What has become of her, then?",
  "53542": "Won't you give me some?",
  "53543": "And you say you can penetrate it?",
  "53544": "If he wants it, where is his nobility?",
  "53545": "And you understand heraldry?",
  "53546": "Where are grace, beauty, and blandishments, like those?",
  "53547": "Wellington?",
  "53548": "You asked, what has driven me to flight at last?",
  "53549": "Did you get blown up?",
  "53550": "Is it against you or against myself?",
  "53551": "When will it take place?",
  "53552": "Will you permit me to be absent for three days?",
  "53553": "What's it all about?",
  "53554": "Surely these tombstones are not all wrong?",
  "53555": "May you tell me whither?",
  "53556": "Oh, is this the boy?",
  "53557": "Ow'm I to know that?",
  "53558": "Isn't that delightfully romantic?",
  "53559": "How many did we crush under the wall?",
  "53560": "When have you ever spoken like that before?",
  "53561": "But you said I might go, father?",
  "53562": "Now what you going to do?",
  "53563": "Would he not come next morning, if he could?",
  "53564": "What does that say?",
  "53565": "How goes it?",
  "53566": "And the florid face?",
  "53567": "And you will not compromise yourself?",
  "53568": "Why it that?",
  "53569": "Ought they to smoke like that?",
  "53570": "Matter?",
  "53571": "Had she seen him again?",
  "53572": "What ails him?",
  "53573": "How did my soul rise again out of those sepulchres?",
  "53574": "And what have you been doing since yesterday?",
  "53575": "Should we go on?",
  "53576": "Did you imply that he has children of his own, sir?",
  "53577": "Do you by chance happen to think of establishing a telegraph?",
  "53578": "What right have we to make these charges?",
  "53579": "And how's this for high?",
  "53580": "How did she murder?",
  "53581": "Are we ready?",
  "53582": "Whose is this little boy?",
  "53583": "You engaged all these men yourself?",
  "53584": "But your honor will look at the baby?",
  "53585": "And if the husband is kind and straightforward, why should not love last?",
  "53586": "Charge?",
  "53587": "Well, then, these tracks upon the grass, were they coming or going?",
  "53588": "Through this window?",
  "53589": "What iss happened?",
  "53590": "Have I done anything to vex you, grandmother?",
  "53591": "And you only married him on that account?",
  "53592": "All set?",
  "53593": "Do you swear that to me?",
  "53594": "Should the aim of punishment be the reformation of the criminal?",
  "53595": "And will these save our lives?",
  "53596": "Is that question in the interests of science too?",
  "53597": "Eh, my pretty?",
  "53598": "Have you entire confidence in your chief officer?",
  "53599": "Is not this true?",
  "53600": "But what has happened?",
  "53601": "What at our hands demand ye?",
  "53602": "What could either do, that I cannot?",
  "53603": "What therefore do you pretend to?",
  "53604": "But those who brought you up?",
  "53605": "Then it must be an ellipse?",
  "53606": "Haven't you seen enough?",
  "53607": "Have we taken alive an inhabitant of the seas of primitive ages?",
  "53608": "Then, why not come away with me?",
  "53609": "Where did he live?",
  "53610": "Or is this pretty artifice contrived, to signify that here the chase must end, and my pursuit be crowned, for you can fly no further?",
  "53611": "Why has so violent a movement been followed by so long a repose?",
  "53612": "A lover?",
  "53613": "But isn't it really an illusion to think you can get out of it?",
  "53614": "What's wrang?",
  "53615": "Don't you remember what reply he gave?",
  "53616": "Can they have finished ploughing?",
  "53617": "Is there any one forgotten thing afore we parts?",
  "53618": "But surely one can do that sometimes?",
  "53619": "Sylvestre?",
  "53620": "And why should your majesty suspect me of dissimulation, I ask?",
  "53621": "Has something special happened?",
  "53622": "Why not try and please us this time?",
  "53623": "How could you behave so unfairly by your sister?",
  "53624": "Am I to believe there's anything real in what you say?",
  "53625": "That's all?",
  "53626": "Why did you suffer him to live?",
  "53627": "Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends?",
  "53628": "Would you like to inhale it for a second?",
  "53629": "Is he not prorsus inutilis ad thorum?",
  "53630": "Do you mean that there is no such maker or creator, or that in one sense there might be a maker of all these things but in another not?",
  "53631": "Well, little girl, what is it?",
  "53632": "Do not you feel a certain vibration of the soil?",
  "53633": "What is that machine?",
  "53634": "Are you quite sure?",
  "53635": "You were going to say?",
  "53636": "Where did these things take place?",
  "53637": "What did you say?",
  "53638": "How do you know where to go to?",
  "53639": "To you and myself?",
  "53640": "Now what does this mean?",
  "53641": "What does it matter to you now, in any case?",
  "53642": "Our father?",
  "53643": "Children, who'd like to race the horses with me?",
  "53644": "Never mind, never mind, what does it matter?",
  "53645": "What o'clock was this?",
  "53646": "And would you just throw in a nod when I seem to ask you for it?",
  "53647": "What was he to say?",
  "53648": "And what is your success?",
  "53649": "Isn't it large?",
  "53650": "That's a most puzzling expression for a natural science man, do you understand?",
  "53651": "Was he not made?",
  "53652": "Would an exchange of name be an exchange of rights?",
  "53653": "And have we, any on us, yet come so low as he come?",
  "53654": "At the same place?",
  "53655": "Have you no longer any kind feeling for your father?",
  "53656": "Out, even to me?",
  "53657": "Do you know?",
  "53658": "The tide?",
  "53659": "Did you receive my little note the day before yesterday?",
  "53660": "What sort of a report would they bring of the result?",
  "53661": "And what are you jawing for like that?",
  "53662": "What did you see?",
  "53663": "Going to see the pictures?",
  "53664": "But who should be the executioner?",
  "53665": "And what was that working?",
  "53666": "What are you going to do about him?",
  "53667": "You are not worse, are you?",
  "53668": "Why not go right down now and fix him?",
  "53669": "If I name one fact you don't know, will you give me back my rifle?",
  "53670": "You may have recognized the fumes?",
  "53671": "Oh, what does that matter?",
  "53672": "From whom did you get this?",
  "53673": "Who do you reckon 't is?",
  "53674": "Why did he not break it there, since it is evident that every yard that he carried it increased the risk of someone meeting him?",
  "53675": "Which I took hold of and was merrily asking him what he would take to have it said for my honour that it was of my getting?",
  "53676": "How did it come to be cut like that?",
  "53677": "Why do you trample upon dead bodies in this temple?",
  "53678": "Whence have you come?",
  "53679": "And how did it happen?",
  "53680": "What do you consider to be the greatest blessing which you have reaped from your wealth?",
  "53681": "Where got she the strength to resist the impulse?",
  "53682": "Anything I like?",
  "53683": "Micawber?",
  "53684": "Are you a large party?",
  "53685": "What were our feelings at that moment?",
  "53686": "Where are you running to?",
  "53687": "A document?",
  "53688": "Do you not reckon me?",
  "53689": "MATERIALS?",
  "53690": "Will any antiquarian inform us, if possible, why these bones were placed here?",
  "53691": "And what do you call these, my darling?",
  "53692": "As to you, monseigneur?",
  "53693": "And had he any right to ask her for a revelation of feelings which she had evidently intended to withhold from him?",
  "53694": "Which of the three is it?",
  "53695": "What do I say?",
  "53696": "And you heard what he said?",
  "53697": "Will you give them to me?",
  "53698": "Well, and what have you been doing?",
  "53699": "Why are there no daffodils now?",
  "53700": "Is it not a happy feeling?",
  "53701": "Why sacrifice forty?",
  "53702": "Where's that ten cents?",
  "53703": "And if he left off dreaming about you, where do you suppose you'd be?",
  "53704": "With your brother?",
  "53705": "Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy?",
  "53706": "Can't you see, you're killing me?",
  "53707": "Now, dear, what are your own?",
  "53708": "I suffer from emotion?",
  "53709": "What laws are there for us?",
  "53710": "And shall she have the head she covets?",
  "53711": "Would she go out to work again?",
  "53712": "Where did I disappear to?",
  "53713": "And you have no way to get news of them?",
  "53714": "Again the law?",
  "53715": "Aunt, will you have some beef?",
  "53716": "Saw her?",
  "53717": "But I must know that you love me, mustn't I?",
  "53718": "Shall we get out and try to find the road?",
  "53719": "You found something compromising?",
  "53720": "Do you see this letter?",
  "53721": "The gentleman who receives us?",
  "53722": "Where de debble did you come frum?",
  "53723": "Has my father asked you for money?",
  "53724": "Who are you, that you should question the judgment of the nations and the ages?",
  "53725": "What would they do in that case?",
  "53726": "You have not counted me out as equal to so much land, and calculated on me as a balance at your banker's?",
  "53727": "Do you know what this plant is?",
  "53728": "Was he awake, or was it but a dream?",
  "53729": "I wonder where we can go next?",
  "53730": "Are you thinking, if I'm drunk itself, I'd leave my daughter living single with a little frisky rascal is the like of you?",
  "53731": "And what awaits you if you remain faithful to your oath, and obey the commands given you?",
  "53732": "Sire, have you in the army one regiment on which you can implicitly rely?",
  "53733": "Will it take long?",
  "53734": "What's that pump stopping for?",
  "53735": "But then, why do you repulse me?",
  "53736": "Are you willing?",
  "53737": "Have I any?",
  "53738": "I wish you'd lend me half a sovereign, will you?",
  "53739": "No, really?",
  "53740": "Can't you see those good people, with a totally strange woman bursting into their house?",
  "53741": "Has he left you for another?",
  "53742": "Can we really affect the adversary's will?",
  "53743": "Shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the sea?",
  "53744": "Was it possible for her to forgive him?",
  "53745": "D'you like all that frilly, bunchy stuff at the throat?",
  "53746": "What purpose do they serve?",
  "53747": "Oh is it?",
  "53748": "Were all those dear, sorrowful, valiant, charming or tragic beings merely dreams?",
  "53749": "Is there anything of the feminine gender among them?",
  "53750": "Lodging?",
  "53751": "Not his brother?",
  "53752": "And which of them made this passage?",
  "53753": "Not more?",
  "53754": "Has he been examined by any synod or council?",
  "53755": "Have you any objection to see him in my presence?",
  "53756": "But what about them at home?",
  "53757": "What is the difference between light and the lustre which is seen on the polished surface of opaque bodies?",
  "53758": "Now, ma'am, am I a fool?",
  "53759": "You know who that is?",
  "53760": "Had she left no friends, no relations behind her?",
  "53761": "What are you doing?",
  "53762": "You will, won't you, dear?",
  "53763": "You'll take me as I am, with nothing?",
  "53764": "Things are all right with you then?",
  "53765": "Ought he to turn to the left or to the right?",
  "53766": "Who dares?",
  "53767": "But how did you manage it, little pa?",
  "53768": "Some what?",
  "53769": "Do you give it to me?",
  "53770": "Tell me, are you human, or are you more than human?",
  "53771": "And you have not made her speak?",
  "53772": "Took hold of you?",
  "53773": "Have you not talked long enough to drink?",
  "53774": "How can you be so cruel to me?",
  "53775": "Are you better?",
  "53776": "Who is it that you have fallen in love with, my poor fellow?",
  "53777": "Come, come, who did you think we were when you ran away from us?",
  "53778": "But what do you require of me, then?",
  "53779": "Do you like roses?",
  "53780": "Not just yet?",
  "53781": "Was there ever a loser content with the loss of the game?",
  "53782": "Going?",
  "53783": "What's the colour of their stockings?",
  "53784": "Why do you look at us like that?",
  "53785": "Does his daughter know of the relapse?",
  "53786": "Is it not a pity that people who are bright and clever should so often be exceedingly improper?",
  "53787": "What did it all mean?",
  "53788": "Would you like a little mash?",
  "53789": "And what salary do you ask?",
  "53790": "I s'pose you'll be starting off for college in a fortnight's time?",
  "53791": "Did you see a young lad passing this way in the early morning or the fall of night?",
  "53792": "How can you say so?",
  "53793": "Could inertia of race, on such a scale, be broken up, or take new form?",
  "53794": "And how did he treat you?",
  "53795": "You, dear mamma?",
  "53796": "What line shall you take, then?",
  "53797": "Towards a new sun?",
  "53798": "May I come in, guardian?",
  "53799": "Has he finished his turn?",
  "53800": "Mahotin?",
  "53801": "Yet why did he come?",
  "53802": "There are those sharks now over the side, don't you see they prefer it tough and rare?",
  "53803": "If you decide to go, why shouldn't you go in the same ship?",
  "53804": "Is it as bad as all that?",
  "53805": "How old are you and what's your name?",
  "53806": "Are the others coming out?",
  "53807": "Are you certain that you can afford to part with so much money, and that it is right that it should be so expended?",
  "53808": "Queer notion, wasn't it?",
  "53809": "Was that last night?",
  "53810": "Is my pa in, do you know?",
  "53811": "Is that all?",
  "53812": "Won't you join us?",
  "53813": "Was this ever possible?",
  "53814": "Their hair?",
  "53815": "Did they leave these two industries to themselves?",
  "53816": "Do they by attaching to the soul and inhering in her at last bring her to death, and so separate her from the body ?",
  "53817": "Have you been slightly dazzled at the sudden fusion of my ingots?",
  "53818": "Perhaps you did not like it?",
  "53819": "Did he look in this way?",
  "53820": "To me?",
  "53821": "But, look here, are you a great hand with the ladies?",
  "53822": "Have you?",
  "53823": "Was he a man or only a crosseyed thief an a loafer?",
  "53824": "Is that all the story?",
  "53825": "None of it at all?",
  "53826": "And how do you find home, now you have come back to it?",
  "53827": "Do you suppose you could find any good in a child by whipping him?",
  "53828": "Is it the secret instinct of decaying nature, or the soul's impulsive throb, as immortality draws on?",
  "53829": "Who was the youth he had adopted and who bore so striking a resemblance to him?",
  "53830": "You wouldn't like to marry a small tradesman or a working man, would you?",
  "53831": "And his offence?",
  "53832": "Are you sure you are not making a mistake?",
  "53833": "You mean your papers?",
  "53834": "It is a poor conclusion, is it not?",
  "53835": "It may also be called temperate, and for the same reasons?",
  "53836": "Don't you think agricultural laborers would rather have three acres and a cow than three acres of printed forms and a committee?",
  "53837": "But surely this is somewhat irrelevant?",
  "53838": "Was it very vile to be dragged back here again?",
  "53839": "Can you break an engagement off slowly?",
  "53840": "Do you wish to ruin us outright?",
  "53841": "Any how does she do?",
  "53842": "You called me a creature of civilization, or something, didn't you?",
  "53843": "Neckett's children?",
  "53844": "Safe?",
  "53845": "My friends, why do I wish for peace?",
  "53846": "Won't you even stay for tea?",
  "53847": "Can he speak?",
  "53848": "And why not with you?",
  "53849": "Well, do you like it?",
  "53850": "What was she to do?",
  "53851": "But can you make any sense out of them?",
  "53852": "He was not playing, then?",
  "53853": "Rosamond a sufferer, a labourer, a female apostle?",
  "53854": "Who could grant them?",
  "53855": "What were you saying about being married?",
  "53856": "That's it, ain't it?",
  "53857": "Was he engaged in a struggle with some animal whose retreat he had disturbed?",
  "53858": "But certain, if execution be remiss or blindfold now, and in this particular, what will it be hereafter and in other books?",
  "53859": "Did he sign, too?",
  "53860": "You're not angry with me any more?",
  "53861": "How long will this fuse burn?",
  "53862": "Why do you hesitate?",
  "53863": "How can I ever describe the charm and picturesqueness of that summer life?",
  "53864": "May I write to you?",
  "53865": "This will be your luggage, I suppose?",
  "53866": "How could that bring you?",
  "53867": "But all our praises why should lords engross?",
  "53868": "And what then would you say?",
  "53869": "What is your opinion on the matter?",
  "53870": "Pictures are like wine, and want age, you think?",
  "53871": "Where is the entrance?",
  "53872": "The barricade?",
  "53873": "What is life at all?",
  "53874": "If you please, sir, should I have no brandy nor nothing to give the poor creetur?",
  "53875": "Is he kind to her?",
  "53876": "Who is conducting the prosecution?",
  "53877": "Is it mingled with anger or hate?",
  "53878": "What had he to do, indeed?",
  "53879": "Why, what, madam, does it signify what I think?",
  "53880": "Will it be believed that the night of so brilliant a day was for me a night of anguish and perplexity?",
  "53881": "Is not this an agreeable surprise?",
  "53882": "What can you not understand?",
  "53883": "Yes, but where?",
  "53884": "What did you burn 'em for?",
  "53885": "But what does that signify?",
  "53886": "Has it indeed?",
  "53887": "What do you want, sir?",
  "53888": "How did that help you?",
  "53889": "Let me hear it?",
  "53890": "But then again, what has the whale to say?",
  "53891": "What power?",
  "53892": "Surely he has some opinion?",
  "53893": "Will it be soon?",
  "53894": "Must I, then?",
  "53895": "Do you call that nourishment?",
  "53896": "What WERE these things?",
  "53897": "Polo?",
  "53898": "Does he like the moor?",
  "53899": "What, dares the villain write in such base terms?",
  "53900": "But what can I do?",
  "53901": "You are quite sure?",
  "53902": "Publish what, you unreasonable man?",
  "53903": "And where do you come from?",
  "53904": "What letter do you mean she returned unopened?",
  "53905": "Why should I not stay here?",
  "53906": "Whence did our servitude commence?",
  "53907": "You insist?",
  "53908": "What's the motive?",
  "53909": "Could he not hinder that, by persuading her out of her system of privation?",
  "53910": "Well, mon cher, what are you doing personally?",
  "53911": "Do you propose to me to do so, D'Artagnan?",
  "53912": "What did he know of himself?",
  "53913": "What is the young lady's name?",
  "53914": "Shall I adventure?",
  "53915": "You won't go either, will you?",
  "53916": "Is that his child?",
  "53917": "Then, sire?",
  "53918": "Object to in them?",
  "53919": "Have you any thing further?",
  "53920": "Why, what do they want with more?",
  "53921": "Tell me, therefore, who are these men who killed the son with despair, and the father with famine?",
  "53922": "You would wish a notary to be sent for then?",
  "53923": "Is HE her uncle?",
  "53924": "And is it really so beautiful as they say?",
  "53925": "Do you not see?",
  "53926": "Look?",
  "53927": "Do you understand, officer?",
  "53928": "From your husband?",
  "53929": "And who are you to teach me?",
  "53930": "Don't you expect to see him?",
  "53931": "You went home?",
  "53932": "Is not that stonework?",
  "53933": "You order me to receive his friends, too, I suppose?",
  "53934": "Have you any?",
  "53935": "Why should I stay here alone?",
  "53936": "Is my lord pleased with his escort?",
  "53937": "Who will lead us through the land?",
  "53938": "Is it a holiday?",
  "53939": "But where did he find it?",
  "53940": "Then I am not like him, am I?",
  "53941": "Have I a friend here?",
  "53942": "On an omnibus?",

  "54341": "Will that please you, dear?",
  "54342": "Out of sorts?",
  "54343": "I?",
  "54344": "Which are my fingers and which are yours?",
  "54345": "Am I not too late?",
  "54346": "But then would it not be better to do away with them entirely?",
  "54347": "And thoroughly?",
  "54348": "Had they written home to tell his mother and father?",
  "54349": "Sing, sir?",
  "54350": "Then, shall the man who is too weak to work be refused a right to the ownership of a coat?",
  "54351": "Are you in the police yourself?",
  "54352": "What hope could they entertain that any portion of the old continent still existed beyond that dreary barrier?",
  "54353": "And what is the name of this village?",
  "54354": "Are you going away, then?",
  "54355": "Was not the secret told me, in the natural recoil of my heart at the first sight of him, and as often as I have seen him since?",
  "54356": "Now, do you want a horse, or will you go afoot?",
  "54357": "Do you not understand?",
  "54358": "Oh, that book, eh?",
  "54359": "You couldn't take a lump sum to let me off?",
  "54360": "You don't beat him?",
  "54361": "Bless you, when you come to talk of a gentleman, who is to define the word?",
  "54362": "You are better?",
  "54363": "Will you shut the door, if you please?",
  "54364": "Why, what had you been doing?",
  "54365": "Have ye ever spoken thus?",
  "54366": "Waiting for somebody?",
  "54367": "Mazarin's factotum?",
  "54368": "Did he love her in return?",
  "54369": "How many limbs have you passed?",
  "54370": "Now, are you right there?",
  "54371": "No sooner, sir?",
  "54372": "If I have said too much, or more than I meant, what of it?",
  "54373": "When is he in fact to have those full civil rights which have so long been his in law?",
  "54374": "What do you propose?",
  "54375": "Is it true that you want to marry her?",
  "54376": "That's to say, you think there's a lack of something in me?",
  "54377": "Is it consistent with the proper dignity and the manly character of a nation?",
  "54378": "When did it come?",
  "54379": "Well, and do you think that those who say so are wrong?",
  "54380": "Come now, which of the two shall speak first?",
  "54381": "Are you so much?",
  "54382": "Have you got any money?",
  "54383": "Like what she used to be, or like what she was in the carriage?",
  "54384": "Why have you not sent to me?",
  "54385": "And now you are going?",
  "54386": "Who else knew where it was?",
  "54387": "What does he mean by that?",
  "54388": "It's you and me, isn't it?",
  "54389": "How shall he meet that dreadful day?",
  "54390": "Did you hear anything?",
  "54391": "A dog or a baby, eh?",
  "54392": "Would you have me indeed, annihilate the memory of the bond between us?",
  "54393": "Does not the timocratical man change into the oligarchical on this wise?",
  "54394": "Where's your warrant?",
  "54395": "Did he give you this?",
  "54396": "What do you say of making an exchange?",
  "54397": "Is she happy?",
  "54398": "How do you mean here?",
  "54399": "Shall I tell you of what it reminded me?",
  "54400": "Dix hasn't been choking you up again, eh?",
  "54401": "Why did his cold eye glisten, and his heart leap up as they went past?",
  "54402": "Burned it?",
  "54403": "To kill us?",
  "54404": "You have nothing to regret?",
  "54405": "And who would not have so believed, hearing him so speak at the point of death?",
  "54406": "Why, then, have they lost in laboring for you what you have gained in not laboring for them?",
  "54407": "Do you remember?",
  "54408": "Raoul?",
  "54409": "Halloa?",

  "54411": "You came to tell me, eh?",
  "54412": "What bell is it?",
  "54413": "And would you now like to look round my place?",
  "54414": "How can you believe yourself?",
  "54415": "Wouldn't it be simplest to run down to the shore and throw himself in the sea?",
  "54416": "Osoph's?",
  "54417": "Ought she to try to overcome her pruderies?",
  "54418": "Perhaps you will sleep in your own room?",
  "54419": "Pray what do you call 'em?",
  "54420": "Whear the HELL wdd ye gang?",
  "54421": "Sharks, I suppose?",
  "54422": "What brings you here?",
  "54423": "Will you live with us?",
  "54424": "All the same, how much might you be disposed to offer me for this beautiful young horse of mine?",
  "54425": "You have your chronometer?",
  "54426": "Won't you stand by me?",
  "54427": "May I speak to your mistresses?",
  "54428": "You want me to throw again, do you not?",
  "54429": "Was it not enough?",
  "54430": "Did you hear what I asked you, or not?",
  "54431": "What is the destination marked on your ticket?",
  "54432": "You believe in the moon then, affecting the weather?",
  "54433": "And there was no one in it but the two of you alone?",
  "54434": "With all this, sir, said I, can you think I shall be at a loss to pass my time?",
  "54435": "Have you ever tried sulphate of copper in water?",
  "54436": "You do not suffer?",
  "54437": "You ain't here to look for it, sir, are you?",
  "54438": "To be ordained, I think you said?",
  "54439": "Didn't I help him to money, or whatever he wanted?",
  "54440": "What about him?",
  "54441": "Would you think you were well off, if there were not one creature in the world near you to love you?",
  "54442": "What ignorance of pain?",
  "54443": "A hunter?",
  "54444": "But what harm had poor I done?",
  "54445": "What's the consequence?",
  "54446": "Isn't it fascination, sir?",
  "54447": "Had you any friends?",
  "54448": "I surveyed him some time, and not being able to recollect his face, demanded, with a faltering accent, what his business was with me?",
  "54449": "Do you mean it's cut out of a single crystal?",
  "54450": "But would his men obey orders?",
  "54451": "In view of our moral, social, and political responsibilities, can we do this?",
  "54452": "Would a man, think you, give YOU up if you were poor?",
  "54453": "What good are we doing with all this ado?",
  "54454": "Heigh ha?",
  "54455": "Or did it come through the post?",
  "54456": "Where are your passports?",
  "54457": "Why show me this, if I am past all hope?",
  "54458": "I don't know him, who is it?",
  "54459": "What have you been doing to this boy of mine, hey?",
  "54460": "But what is to be done now?",
  "54461": "Is solidarity becoming closer, or competition diminishing?",
  "54462": "Shall I go with you?",
  "54463": "What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?",
  "54464": "At this rate, man, how can you ever expect to marry?",
  "54465": "I says to myself, spos'n he can't fix that leg just in three shakes of a sheep's tail, as the saying is?",
  "54466": "And you will try and save yourself by swimming?",
  "54467": "What sort of a man is he?",
  "54468": "In the port?",
  "54469": "And who showed you up into this room?",
  "54470": "How many are there?",
  "54471": "What are we to do about it all?",
  "54472": "I foppish?",

  "54491": "Mother, why did our grand relation keep on putting his hand up to his mistarshers?",
  "54492": "Said I in secret?",
  "54493": "Dull?",
  "54494": "Where can I lodge him hereabouts for the present?",
  "54495": "What could that treasure of the centenarian be, which was so precious and so secret?",
  "54496": "Will you go on?",
  "54497": "Is that displeasing to you?",
  "54498": "Does your head ache?",
  "54499": "Cusick?",
  "54500": "Why are you late?",
  "54501": "Oh, well, den, why didn't yo' say so fust, dat it was only a theory?",
  "54502": "Hate?",
  "54503": "Was it not you, and your sufferance of them, that have nourished them?",
  "54504": "Then we'll be about a week on the way?",

  "54601": "What does the warrior want with the scalps of women?",
  "54602": "Those that sweeten and those that embitter?",
  "54603": "Can you endure to think of the dismemberment of our country?",
  "54604": "Do you think I am to be imposed upon by that northern accent, which you have assumed?",
  "54605": "I suppose you've heard of me?",
  "54606": "You like my new suit?",
  "54607": "What, then, do you suppose?",

  "54611": "How can she stay in the town where you are?",
  "54612": "Who's sending him back?",
  "54613": "Or, why are so many witnesses summoned, and so many artifices practised, to discover what so easy an experiment would infallibly reveal?",
  "54614": "Can I appoint you my executor?",
  "54615": "How about the horses?",
  "54616": "Do you really know any others who have it?",
  "54617": "How will you give me notice of it?",
  "54618": "Well, dash it all, old top, it surely isn't news to you?",
  "54619": "And the goldsmith?",
  "54620": "Why, I hope you will not a hawking now, will you?",
  "54621": "You do not intend to be his wife?",
  "54622": "How know you it?",
  "54623": "How had he come to such a pass?",
  "54624": "But why should not I wear pink ribbons?",
  "54625": "For who could have forborne?",
  "54626": "But what do you propose to do?",
  "54627": "How could you so cruel?",
  "54628": "That is to say, you would rather not?",
  "54629": "Could this have any connection with the crime?",
  "54630": "Why am I asked what next shall see the light?",
  "54631": "Why did he feel that it was not unwatchful?",
  "54632": "Where's that other beast?",
  "54633": "Of course, I didn't, did I?",
  "54634": "What would it cost, sir, if we stopped here?",
  "54635": "Now, where is the romance in all that?",
  "54636": "And the same wages as he had?",
  "54637": "Do ye presume to say that our seamen are not honest men?",
  "54638": "No one will be less likely to commit adultery, or to dishonour his father and mother, or to fall in his religious duties?",
  "54639": "That you think it would be so charming?",

  "54644": "That their genius should not have in it, even after the lapse of ages, some little of heaven?",
  "54645": "Who SHOULD realise if I don't?",
  "54646": "Why, cannot you see that they are all infatuated with pride and vanity?",
  "54647": "Had she not guessed anything, seen anything, comprehended anything?",
  "54648": "And what then, sir?",
  "54649": "That you do not wish to compromise her?",
  "54650": "Which is the best?",
  "54651": "Wherefore, then, should I be dissatisfied?",
  "54652": "How are my father and mother?",
  "54653": "How much had he written away?",
  "54654": "Will your excellency be so good as to mount the shoulders of two of our men, they will carry you ashore?",
  "54655": "You see that pile of pig iron?",
  "54656": "What could he wish or look for that he would not have obtained through my friendship?",
  "54657": "Are you?",
  "54658": "Can you tell a good many fighting stories?",
  "54659": "What bride?",

  "54664": "Is there any city which he might name?",
  "54665": "Will your majesty permit me to express a contrary opinion?",
  "54666": "Cut ye out quite, hasn't he?",
  "54667": "What little gell's this?",
  "54668": "Who's the stranger?",
  "54669": "Did you hear us?",
  "54670": "Do the dead come back?",

  "54678": "What do you think he wants to do?",
  "54679": "What ails us gazing where all seen is hollow?",
  "54680": "And when you want to buy a ship, the shipwright or the pilot would be better?",
  "54681": "How do you know that?",
  "54682": "How could it be possible for us to disobey your commands?",
  "54683": "But in what sense?",
  "54684": "About whom?",
  "54685": "Where, where are you going to?",
  "54686": "Why not you also?",
  "54687": "Wouldn't it be fun?",

  "54730": "Pip, will you tell me something?",
  "54731": "What lunacy is this, that haunts this man?",
  "54732": "Say, how long are you going to stay here?",
  "54733": "How shall I make my music now?",

  "54736": "How would you like that?",
  "54737": "Why is she so excruciatingly beautiful that I cannot be angry with her, even now?",
  "54738": "That is your affair?",
  "54739": "You know he shot his brother?",
  "54740": "What noise was that?",
  "54741": "What would you give that you could help loving me?",
  "54742": "Do we suppose that principle, whatever it may be in man, which has to do with justice and injustice, to be inferior to the body?",
  "54743": "Yes, what it is?",
  "54744": "Where had he seen those lineaments?",
  "54745": "Of what was I speaking?",
  "54746": "Never in moderation?",
  "54747": "Is the other one stuffed also?",
  "54748": "What best wishes?",
  "54749": "I mean the one with the three naked women?",
  "54750": "Why, who else could I possibly suspect?",
  "54751": "What made you leave me to come here alone?",
  "54752": "Something will turn up?",
  "54753": "Abandon this subject altogether, and again jeer at the monks and ridicule the nuns?",
  "54754": "Have these very matters ever produced any difficulty amongst us?",
  "54755": "Have I not also critics who do not spare me?",
  "54756": "What avails recrimination over matters wholly past recall?",
  "54757": "It die?",
  "54758": "But if he had escaped?",
  "54759": "Who was that insolent fellow?",
  "54760": "What new mystery was this?",
  "54761": "What do I think of it?",
  "54762": "Won't you ever change your mind?",
  "54763": "Is not this unavoidable?",
  "54764": "Have you spoken to her?",
  "54765": "But what could it do, if any danger came?",
  "54766": "That would be good, wouldn't it?",
  "54767": "Could it be for any other reason than that he did not want to see it, and if so was he not a traitor to the cause of truth?",
  "54768": "Why are better results attained under scientific management than under the other types?",
  "54769": "Ah, a weapon?",
  "54770": "Run away?",
  "54771": "What was he, then?",
  "54772": "Matter?",
  "54773": "Not paralysis, I hope?",
  "54774": "Run away?",
  "54775": "What does he say?",
  "54776": "Why is it that the peace of the country is disturbed in order that one people may assume to judge of what another people should do?",
  "54777": "So you think he'll make her an offer today?",
  "54778": "But where is he?",
  "54779": "Don't you want to tell me?",
  "54780": "It was the only letter you had?",
  "54781": "You have no explanation yourself of the tragedy?",
  "54782": "What do you mean by having made a stiff?",
  "54783": "What different armour should I need?",
  "54784": "Should he abandon her?",
  "54785": "Who is with him?",
  "54786": "Can you bear witness that you're no better than a fool?",
  "54787": "It will be asked, how did this mischief happen?",
  "54788": "What should I do with a translation?",
  "54789": "You did not get my letter?",
  "54790": "By whom was she espied, and how entrapped?",
  "54791": "And weren't you ever afraid?",
  "54792": "Is she a very massive person?",
  "54793": "And what is your opinion?",
  "54794": "Perchance you think to put him i' the thick of the shots?",
  "54795": "According to scientific notions of inertia and force, what ought to be the result?",
  "54796": "And your address?",
  "54797": "What sort of husband can he be?",
  "54798": "How do they use to be?",
  "54799": "Why should we?",
  "54800": "What are you doing there, you rascal?",
  "54801": "Convicts?",
  "54802": "Why, then, are you about to betray it to me?",
  "54803": "But even in that case, may he have no object beyond his present station, to which he may sacrifice his independence?",
  "54804": "And powder, and bullets?",
  "54805": "Have you had one of your bad nights?",
  "54806": "What, my friends, must be the consequences of this agitation?",
  "54807": "Can I do anything for you, gentlemen?",
  "54808": "Is he not a beauty?",
  "54809": "Could he still rise and regain his footing in his conscience upon something solid?",
  "54810": "Don't you know it?",
  "54811": "Is it not indeed great enough, sire?",
  "54812": "Are you ambitious, and do you seek after the greatnesses of the earth?",
  "54813": "When they have no leaves and look gray and brown and dry, how can you tell whether they are dead or alive?",
  "54814": "Would we be able to see those pictures?",
  "54815": "Then if children make so much trouble, why do people have 'em?",
  "54816": "And you never confined your patients?",
  "54817": "How could you be so obstinate?",
  "54818": "Tom, what on earth ails that cat?",
  "54819": "Then I did not kill him?",
  "54820": "If he had not had his 'profonde' what would he have done?",
  "54821": "What is to be done with her, then?",
  "54822": "Do you know what it is?",
  "54823": "I do something?",
  "54824": "Which way went he, young man?",
  "54825": "Are you coming to this ball?",
  "54826": "Why did he not correct our judgment at the start?",
  "54827": "How can one deceive these dear little birds, when they look at one so sweetly and confidingly?",
  "54828": "Is wealth thy passion?",
  "54829": "What is the matter at home?",
  "54830": "Is there any sense in it?",
  "54831": "And where is he going?",
  "54832": "Well, what have I to do with that?",
  "54833": "Do you not consume supplies as fast as you get them forward?",
  "54834": "But, what am I saying?",
  "54835": "Shall we try argument?",
  "54836": "She is at home?",
  "54837": "Verdurin?",
  "54838": "Then I asked if there were many clerks?",
  "54839": "How can he talk like that?",
  "54840": "But who gave you leave to cease eating mutton?",
  "54841": "And what can one do?",
  "54842": "Yes, that is the doctor we've been sewing for, is it?",
  "54843": "What pamphlet is this?",
  "54844": "Was it not for these causes that you send for me when the great trouble came?",
  "54845": "May I live with you, and tend upon you as I used to do?",
  "54846": "Will you unclasp your hand?",
  "54847": "Wasn't you bad enough when you threw all the money away, so you had to go an' do this just when we was in awful trouble?",
  "54848": "Why don't you go to your bankers?",
  "54849": "Do you see this same ram?",
  "54850": "Shall I go and offer her my services?",
  "54851": "And why does the minister keep his hand over his heart?",
  "54852": "Who keeps house here?",
  "54853": "Are they not bubbles?",
  "54854": "How is all with you?",
  "54855": "Tasting?",
  "54856": "What are his qualifications?",
  "54857": "Where did you start from?",
  "54858": "Could anything cause us to swerve to one side?",
  "54859": "And are not both the city and the entire temple now full of the dead bodies of your countrymen?",
  "54860": "Couldn't we start out and scour the country before the fellow gets away?",
  "54861": "You dine and sleep here, of course?",
  "54862": "What else could I look for, being what I am, and leading such a life as mine?",
  "54863": "Why didn't you come to dinner?",
  "54864": "Where is this poor giant, or this poor wretch of a vanquished knight, to find her?",
  "54865": "It is the first time, then, that you ever went to that house?",
  "54866": "How may we pass that which is impassable?",
  "54867": "In what stables champed these sleek, nervous horses and rested the gorgeous carriages?",
  "54868": "And what am I to tell your father?",
  "54869": "The box of mischief thus opened in society, what is to preserve private virtue, the only security of public freedom and universal happiness?",
  "54870": "My father is well, is he not?",
  "54871": "Was it going farther from, or nearing, the disc?",
  "54872": "How is this?",
  "54873": "Recollect, my lord, if he did not say something a little like that to you?",
  "54874": "Is he really her cousin, as he says?",
  "54875": "Who's to prevent me?",
  "54876": "Why dig up the pestilence from the pit in which it is buried?",
  "54877": "The other question?",
  "54878": "I may go on?",
  "54879": "And by whom?",
  "54880": "It is true, then?",
  "54881": "Should an ass exceed me in fortitude?",
  "54882": "Would the island hold together till then?",
  "54883": "No, why should you?",
  "54884": "What can I do sir?",
  "54885": "Should I have remained in that house, near you and them, if I did not love them?",
  "54886": "And this letter?",
  "54887": "What d'you charge for a ride, boss?",
  "54888": "What is the matter?",
  "54889": "And if it be so, what is it?",
  "54890": "Mother, what are you crying for?",
  "54891": "Were I to allow you to march out, what security can I have that you will not join them, and afterwards fight against me?",
  "54892": "Reinforcements?",
  "54893": "What would it be right to do?",
  "54894": "What's up with you?",
  "54895": "Should it ever be said that he had robbed those old men, whom he so truly and so tenderly loved in his heart of hearts?",
  "54896": "What made you think he'd ceased to take any interest in the case?",
  "54897": "Is it anything I have done that has pulled you down like that?",
  "54898": "What could my father mean by sending me to be an inmate in this strange family?",
  "54899": "You mean you'll have no quarrel with me?",
  "54900": "Was he awake or was he asleep?",
  "54901": "Well, but if I bought the mill, and allowed your husband to act as my manager in the same way, how then?",
  "54902": "What am I to do if I love him and the other one too?",
  "54903": "And have you come from far like this?",
  "54904": "And what did I tell 'ee?",
  "54905": "Could she, who had been so active in the getting up of the funeral triumph, do less than exult?",
  "54906": "Who now will tell the ladies that I would hie me thither?",
  "54907": "What is genius?",
  "54908": "You have taken care, I hope, of the casket I sent you to lock up?",
  "54909": "What evils?",
  "54910": "And is it wounded?",
  "54911": "What recollections of boyhood and innocence might have been flitting across his brain?",
  "54912": "What noise is that?",
  "54913": "No dignity in whaling?",
  "54914": "Why could they not wait a little?",
  "54915": "No apology, I suppose?",
  "54916": "What are you thinking of?",
  "54917": "How have I offended?",
  "54918": "Why should we be unable to preserve a remembrance of them?",
  "54919": "There is something else you wanted to say?",
  "54920": "Was I not right in saying at the outset that, relatively to the tax, we are behind our institutions?",
  "54921": "What charge, sir?",
  "54922": "Did you see no one?",
  "54923": "Ah, now, couldn't you take me with you?",
  "54924": "Oh, may I get this rose?",
  "54925": "He asked me whether I would go with him?",
  "54926": "A'n't you getting all you hoped for, ay, and more than you hoped for?",
  "54927": "Why did you leave him on the road?",
  "54928": "And in such a case what is one to say?",
  "54929": "Yes, why?",
  "54930": "To which of us?",
  "54931": "Could we not break it?",
  "54932": "What does he drink?",
  "54933": "But however are you going to race in this mud?",
  "54934": "Is this the part of wise men, engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty?",
  "54935": "Cannot you describe her?",
  "54936": "And that which is not more or less a harmony is not more or less harmonized?",
  "54937": "A joke?",
  "54938": "What is his folly?",
  "54939": "I must, then, remain here?",
  "54940": "Who were they?",
  "54941": "Mercenary, mem?",
  "54942": "Well then, my dear, why don't you praise the neatness and prettiness with which it's kept?",
  "54943": "Have you not read in my eyes that there is nothing but devotion and sympathy in my heart?",
  "54944": "Is that worth talking about and making so much ado?",
  "54945": "When are you starting?",
  "54946": "You want no treasures and no castles?",
  "54947": "You will live on our selection, won't you?",
  "54948": "He wouldn't have so much influence, then, don't you reckon?",
  "54949": "Now then, gentlemen, shall I break the seal or not?",
  "54950": "It must have been on the boulevard?",
  "54951": "Could a statue of marble have been more impassive and more mute?",
  "54952": "Would you like to?",
  "54953": "Do you call yourself a raw country girl?",
  "54954": "And, then, do you think that my stumps are pretty?",
  "54955": "But do you fail to live?",
  "54956": "Sure it's he?",
  "54957": "Whose fault?",
  "54958": "She has formed no other attachment?",
  "54959": "What matter?",
  "54960": "And wherefore has he not been to see me?",
  "54961": "Shall we really try it?",
  "54962": "Doth any praise himself?",
  "54963": "Now, then, where's the first boy?",
  "54964": "What has age to do with it?",
  "54965": "What besides?",
  "54966": "Separate, my dear?",
  "54967": "Now, why don't you take my advice?",
  "54968": "Do you wish I hadn't come?",
  "54969": "And alone?",
  "54970": "Why should I pull her into it?",
  "54971": "You would not kill yourself?",
  "54972": "No cheering news, then?",
  "54973": "And with what object?",
  "54974": "Monks would never learn how you knew what you do?",
  "54975": "What do you keep SAYING you will for?",
  "54976": "Was it so?",
  "54977": "But the earl?",
  "54978": "Do you see, now, one reason why I have let you go thus early into the world?",
  "54979": "Will you show me your plan?",
  "54980": "Can't one cut pages with a garden knife?",
  "54981": "What needs appealing in a fact so plain?",
  "54982": "And if he have great riches, to you leave him all his wealth, or do you make him a beggar?",
  "54983": "Bast?",
  "54984": "What was it you wanted to ask, sir?",
  "54985": "Did you ever hear such a name?",
  "54986": "Can it attack it beneath the waves?",
  "54987": "To those who love as ourselves, in what respect differs a year from an hour?",
  "54988": "And you think that just?",
  "54989": "You will start at once?",
  "54990": "To what point of the continent?",
  "54991": "From whence can she come?",
  "54992": "Will you play?",
  "54993": "What's to hinder 'em from cutting right and left if they begin?",
  "54994": "Give up the parish altogether?",
  "54995": "And what was the policy of that ally?",
  "54996": "But who should tell him so?",
  "54997": "Her voice when she talked to them?",
  "54998": "Would the militia, in this supposition, be more ready or more able to support the federal authority than in the case of a general union?",
  "54999": "Is he in favor of all these things at once?",
  "55000": "Or show you restless, miswandering, misclimbing ones, new and easier footpaths?",
  "55001": "Do you think the thing possible?",
  "55002": "Is the door shut?",
  "55003": "But what will you do?",
  "55004": "Well, then, have you any better plan to propose?",
  "55005": "What, have you a wife, then?",
  "55006": "But does nothing depend on it for them?",
  "55007": "You are well?",
  "55008": "You do love me still?",
  "55009": "Where do your excellencies wish to go?",
  "55010": "Then what the devil brought you here, being a churchman?",
  "55011": "You know what to beautify is, I suppose?",
  "55012": "How can I commit such treachery?",
  "55013": "And what is it doing in the world?",
  "55014": "Do you know, sir?",
  "55015": "And what does it amount to, after all?",
  "55016": "By his son, sir?",
  "55017": "But how, madame?",
  "55018": "What course is that?",
  "55019": "What did the gardener say?",
  "55020": "Why cucumber sandwiches?",
  "55021": "A duel, you mean?",
  "55022": "But what is thy name?",
  "55023": "Ma foi, what rival?",
  "55024": "An't that as nat'ral as walking, and as good for the health?",
  "55025": "Do I then strive after HAPPINESS?",
  "55026": "One should never admit anything in electioneering matters, should one?",
  "55027": "Is she game for that?",
  "55028": "Is it void of understanding?",
  "55029": "And who dictated it?",
  "55030": "Was it not this?",
  "55031": "Who's there?",
  "55032": "What next, I wonder?",
  "55033": "What ails you?",
  "55034": "But what of that, so long as it tickles the palate more strongly?",
  "55035": "Is the sea not full of green islands?",
  "55036": "Whence then this obvious DISQUALITY?",
  "55037": "There is a deficit, you say?",
  "55038": "And is it the case now?",
  "55039": "Because you can see she is in love with you?",
  "55040": "Who was the man?",
  "55041": "Where does he tempt one to stray from duty?",
  "55042": "What does it strike you that I've done?",
  "55043": "Money down?",
  "55044": "Jane's mother is going to let her have a birthday party?",
  "55045": "Have you not shelter, and food, and leisure?",
  "55046": "And what can be said in, at least, partial defence of the actual historical procedure of the nations?",
  "55047": "What should I get by sending to you?",
  "55048": "Sailors?",
  "55049": "You found her well and awaiting you?",
  "55050": "Where is it located?",
  "55051": "Didn't the cavalry all start this morning?",
  "55052": "Why, what do you mean?",
  "55053": "What other men can be thirty leagues under ground?",
  "55054": "What, is it laborers they want for the harvest?",
  "55055": "Who shall describe the anxiety, the agony, which in some measure must have been the lot of every frontier family?",
  "55056": "Why didn't we think of that before?",
  "55057": "What the devil are you doing there in such an agitated manner?",
  "55058": "And what will that signify to me?",
  "55059": "Why will you be silent?",
  "55060": "How then stands the case?",
  "55061": "And you think it funny, no doubt?",
  "55062": "What is gentleness?",
  "55063": "Do you wish this change so very much, sir?",
  "55064": "Do you think I can teach a small school?",
  "55065": "What can I do, my son?",
  "55066": "For a more active primate?",
  "55067": "What on earth is up?",
  "55068": "Where are you going, then, dear bear?",
  "55069": "Shall we have them sit up to the table and serve them with the complete dinner, enlivening it with intellectual conversation?",
  "55070": "Well, fwiend?",
  "55071": "And papa's written consent?",
  "55072": "How could he have been so forgetful?",
  "55073": "And taking it as a story, what do you think of it?",
  "55074": "Can he be afraid of this boy?",
  "55075": "How about returning?",
  "55076": "Don't you mean the composition pedals?",
  "55077": "Well, what is there surprising in that?",
  "55078": "Do you see any objection?",
  "55079": "I wonder when he got the message?",
  "55080": "You hadn't?",
  "55081": "You will, of course, command it yourself?",
  "55082": "What in the name heaven shall I do?",
  "55083": "What is the process for releasing a prisoner?",
  "55084": "O, what's up now?",
  "55085": "I mean, have you ever been where there's water?",
  "55086": "How could I forget it?",
  "55087": "And where is her husband?",
  "55088": "Thomasin, do you know that they have had a bitter quarrel?",
  "55089": "So you're in the washing business, ma'am?",
  "55090": "And I am to hide my guilt, as I have done so many years?",
  "55091": "Pray what was his offence?",
  "55092": "Was it possible he had deceived himself so utterly about her?",
  "55093": "What was it you put on that chair near the window?",
  "55094": "Who else is it?",
  "55095": "Why should I try to shield him from the consequences of his own wicked acts?",
  "55096": "When do you think of setting out?",
  "55097": "Would your dog go with him?",
  "55098": "Where's mother?",
  "55099": "Of the long ago?",
  "55100": "Do you own a dog?",
  "55101": "You begin to see?",
  "55102": "Is it not evil, only evil, and that continually?",
  "55103": "What's the good of sending him away?",
  "55104": "What did they wish to say that their faces were so strange?",
  "55105": "Why is one born with good tendencies and another with evil ones?",
  "55106": "What evil has befallen our royal house?",
  "55107": "Are you certain of that?",
  "55108": "What was there after all?",
  "55109": "Clara, my love, have you forgotten?",
  "55110": "Was he to send out privy seals?",
  "55111": "Is that the case?",
  "55112": "What's the matter with you?",
  "55113": "Who can look at these rocks, and allow the voluptuousness of nature to be an excuse for gratifying the desires it inspires?",
  "55114": "Where in the world have you been, my lad?",
  "55115": "For do you not see the wide and unknown wilderness behind?",
  "55116": "Yes, who was she?",
  "55117": "And do you cool yourself in that stream now, my young friend?",
  "55118": "Why, especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not care about me?",
  "55119": "What better way was there to take care of his life in the helpless growing time than by passing him into obscurity?",
  "55120": "Are you going anywhere in particular just now?",
  "55121": "What are you but a boy?",
  "55122": "See you nothing walking on the shore of the pond?",
  "55123": "Which one?",
  "55124": "Is it ill done?",
  "55125": "You're sure you had it on when you left the ball?",
  "55126": "What more do you know about him?",
  "55127": "But may I give it to you?",
  "55128": "Male or female, sir?",
  "55129": "But do you see they don't think we are married?",
  "55130": "What is the latest news about your father?",
  "55131": "Are you educated, young sir?",

  "55657": "Is reason, then, synonymous with intelligence?",
  "55658": "What is there to say to such a question?",
  "55659": "What should be our attitude toward separate schools?",
  "55660": "How is it they don't take proper precautions?",
  "55661": "Don't you want to see it?",
  "55662": "Or is it to be decided by your own laws, by your own rules of judicature?",

  "55672": "Why must you?",
  "55673": "Now, will you?",
  "55674": "But have you tried?",
  "55675": "What more did he ask you?",
  "55676": "Does not this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practical resolution in facing death?",
  "55677": "Everybody liked her, didn't they?",

  "55698": "The peasants are rioting, and you can't manage them?",
  "55699": "Is it from mere humanity you bid me live?",
  "55700": "Don't you want anything?",
  "55701": "Is it alive?",
  "55702": "You can bear a little more?",
  "55703": "The next question was, who should reign?",

  "55720": "If you think it's so lovely, why don't you go and see it yourself?",
  "55721": "You noticed that I didn't breathe a word as to the purpose of our visit?",
  "55722": "How am I?",
  "55723": "And who that considers the weight of the burden on this man's back, will say that the prayer was an improper one?",
  "55724": "What is the good of making him inhale ammonia and all that parcel of drugs?",
  "55725": "Why should you not be there?",

  "55728": "And how do you know it?",
  "55729": "Shall I be baffled thus?",
  "55730": "Should she unclasp it, should she not?",
  "55731": "Why were they keeping him pent up in this narrow crate?",
  "55732": "Wher' you bound for, young man?",
  "55733": "It is ignominious to feel poor, isn't it?",

  "55737": "Do you hear me say he struck me?",
  "55738": "Do you call that LESS?",
  "55739": "Can it be he?",
  "55740": "Why do I tell myself lies?",
  "55741": "But does he therefore confer no benefit when he works for nothing?",
  "55742": "Had he not saved her, and was he not entitled to this honour?",
  "55743": "Is it in property?",
  "55744": "But how was I to write?",
  "55745": "We ought to think of it, oughtn't we?",
  "55746": "Couldn't we take a ride on the top of a tram?",
  "55747": "Are you glad, papa?",
  "55748": "Suppose her majesty refuses?",
  "55749": "Oh, you be, be you?",
  "55750": "Tell me, do you think the number of your company is greater than mine?",
  "55751": "Sure of what?",
  "55752": "Would you like to give me a kiss for a poem?",
  "55753": "Will you not bring me a little water?",

  "55766": "Don't you know that all the world is talking about you?",
  "55767": "Of what importance, then, is the materiality of the punishment?",
  "55768": "What can we do to save him?",
  "55769": "Have you experienced it?",
  "55770": "'Twas at that I caught 'ee once, if you can mind?",
  "55771": "What, naturally, in the way of the priceless, hasn't she got?",
  "55772": "Had the hour of adversity come?",
  "55773": "Do you mean to say he has the presumption to hope to pass from intendant to superintendent?",
  "55774": "Tell me how?",
  "55775": "What did it taste like?",
  "55776": "Why should we disappear and give place to others, when we may still, if we choose, remain in the front rank and lead the battle?",

  "55833": "Did you not?",
  "55834": "Am I taken prisoner or have I taken him prisoner?",
  "55835": "Do you think that a good man and a bad must share the same fate, and alike die, and end?",
  "55836": "Does it matter?",
  "55837": "What do you go for, then?",
  "55838": "It's almost enough to make us get married after all, isn't it?",
  "55839": "How do you feel now, my love?",
  "55840": "What is this, then?",
  "55841": "Did you want him too to go sailing about amid all kinds of hardship while others are eating up his estate?",

  "55863": "Shall we follow you?",
  "55864": "Why not exclude every man convicted of any degrading legal crime, even petty larceny?",
  "55865": "But advocates and proctors are not one and the same?",
  "55866": "You surely do not mean to let the child dine at eight o'clock?",
  "55867": "Well, what are we to do?",
  "55868": "I hope you won't dislike the trouble of all this?",
  "55869": "By whom can he have been instigated?",
  "55870": "You won't care to stay at home now, perhaps?",

  "55874": "Did I not understand you to say that, as the consequence of the collision, the character of the comet's orbit has been changed?",
  "55875": "Why, too, should he write a letter now, rather than six years ago?",
  "55876": "All ready?",
  "55877": "Might she have loved me?",
  "55878": "What can you do then?",
  "55879": "Your daughter?",
  "55880": "But where is she?",
  "55881": "But can this be possible?",
  "55882": "No, you do not, do you?",
  "55883": "What help do you want from me?",
  "55884": "Tell me at once that I want to assassinate you?",
  "55885": "Is it not those very persons who mourn for him?",

  "55887": "The first?",
  "55888": "Will he continue, then, to keep our secret?",
  "55889": "Aren't we going to stay here?",
  "55890": "Have I changed so much?",
  "55891": "All your naughty purposes, I make no doubt, were quite changed?",

  "55903": "What would the minister have said, mother?",
  "55904": "Plague on't, my lord, have you brought me here to get my horoscope out of me?",
  "55905": "Do you suppose that I am afraid to die?",
  "55906": "How many all told?",
  "55907": "What letters?",
  "55908": "Will it not be better that she should keep the resentment of the insult for ever?",
  "55909": "Why do they wish to kill you, m'sieur?",
  "55910": "What could be the cause of this phenomenon?",
  "55911": "Or whether it eats and drinks?",
  "55912": "But what would you say in it?",
  "55913": "May I go up and speak to her?",
  "55914": "Manager of the company or the house?",
  "55915": "Did he think I'd flinch from his bottle?",
  "55916": "Did they want to cut his chin off?",

  "57538": "What then?",
  "57539": "What female heart can gold despise?",
  "57540": "Still?",
  "57541": "What are you to live on?",
  "57542": "And this keepsake that you keep under lock and key, and moon over at times, is that a remembrance from her?",

  "58306": "What is thy visit's purpose?",
  "58307": "A glass of srub and water, now?",
  "58308": "Do you see that idle lad riding while his old father has to walk?",
  "58309": "Cartouche?",
  "58310": "Of course I shall never seen anything more of either of you now?",
  "58311": "Who could there be?",
  "58312": "Is it WHOM you like?",
  "58313": "Eh?",
  "58314": "Does he know the word?",
  "58315": "And I'm to be bridesmaid, aren't I?",
  "58316": "What trick would it be?",
  "58317": "He was calm and radiant, was he not?",
  "58318": "I give you my word I won't, only what shall I say when they ask me?",
  "58319": "Don't mean it?",
  "58320": "How could this be?",
  "58321": "Is this, my dear friend, what we agreed upon?",
  "58322": "About this who can tell?",
  "58323": "Are you in a hurry?",
  "58324": "I went my way, filled with amazement, asking myself what this all meant, to what race of beings belonged this huntress of the tombs?",
  "58325": "Were there many there?",
  "58326": "What phenomenon was this that had produced a cataclysm so tremendous in effect upon earth, sky, and sea?",
  "58327": "I wonder who he can be, anyhow?",
  "58328": "You do not tell me what I am to grant you?",
  "58329": "Now do tell us why you must needs lie about it?",
  "58330": "Is he come again?",
  "58331": "Cannot the enemy ford the river?",
  "58332": "Will you come and dine with me?",
  "58333": "Told whom?",
  "58334": "Where do we stand?",
  "58335": "And the pain in your chest?",
  "58336": "Should he send another detachment to the rescue of the first?",
  "58337": "Can I be both?",
  "58338": "And you will not come in, then?",
  "58339": "Why be afraid?",
  "58340": "Why had he fled?",
  "58341": "He will be condemned, will he not?",
  "58342": "We four?",
  "58343": "Would you like me never to see anyone?",
  "58344": "IS that grass in the hollow green or golden?",
  "58345": "What would this mean but that, practically, he was never to be tried or tested?",
  "58346": "Have you ever seen this stone in the chemist's shops, the beautiful and transparent one, from which they kindle fire?",
  "58347": "Or do they only believe the stammerer?",
  "58348": "You think, then, I have something to dread?",

  "58350": "Took eleven calls, did he?",
  "58351": "What could this house be?",
  "58352": "Where are you?",
  "58353": "Dog?",
  "58354": "What point of view?",
  "58355": "And isn't that what we do best?",
  "58356": "Have I not for eighteen months been doing everything to obtain it?",
  "58357": "You are of that opinlon?",
  "58358": "Have I by any means displeased you?",

  "58361": "And pertinent to what does my father reply, by words so sceptical, to an assertion so seldom disputed?",
  "58362": "Why did you not tell me monsieur, that you came to relate me this?",
  "58363": "So, I suppose, if I were to come in at twelve o'clock at night, the child would have had nothing to eat?",
  "58364": "Who are your parents?",
  "58365": "Had you any special object?",
  "58366": "The first week?",
  "58367": "Who's there?",
  "58368": "And have you any on hand just now?",
  "58369": "Don't you remember shooting a pigeon, you and I, one day?",

  "58377": "What do you want to turn on me like that for?",
  "58378": "But where am I to sit?",
  "58379": "But does it not show great weakness?",
  "58380": "Where must we place him?",

  "58385": "Have you brought me what you said you would?",
  "58386": "You have not had a cable, have you?",
  "58387": "What calumny is this?",
  "58388": "Have you any passengers?",
  "58389": "In fact, would it not be less valuable in this, that it would break no great line of the enemy's communications, while mine would?",
  "58390": "All your population?",
  "58391": "Is it still only an intention, your eminence?",
  "58392": "Have you brought forth children as she has done?",
  "58393": "Was it too abrupt a transition from the habits of the twelve preceding years?",
  "58394": "Did you kill him then?",
  "58395": "I can go out with him if I want to, can't I?",
  "58396": "How could they have done that?",
  "58397": "Is there one of your fathers or mothers or friends who does not see through them?",
  "58398": "But the motive for this meeting?",
  "58399": "Do you not see how very suggestive that is?",
  "58400": "See you not the scar of the awl?",
  "58401": "Was it for that you mightn't go back?",
  "58402": "What's kep us poor?",
  "58403": "Do we not know that man is frail and fickle, that his heart is full of delusions, and that his lips are a distillery of falsehood?",
  "58404": "Why were all these acts?",
  "58405": "How the devil can you dream of fawning on me?",
  "58406": "Which part should I keep back?",

  "58416": "You know it then?",
  "58417": "Who brought it here?",
  "58418": "What are your excellency's orders?",
  "58419": "What is this, my lord?",
  "58420": "And of whom?",
  "58421": "When do you intend to give up sermonising?",
  "58422": "Deduce what?",
  "58423": "You haven't got a needle and thread I suppose?",

  "58425": "His days, then, are shorter than ours?",
  "58426": "How is the old boy?",
  "58427": "If he did not, should he risk trying to make an ally of her?",
  "58428": "And how about her?",
  "58429": "Where is my funnel?",
  "58430": "Why all?",
  "58431": "How can you suppose that so brilliant a destiny will be extinguished in that remote and miserable scene?",

  "58436": "And who is to be the judge?",
  "58437": "You did not notice it, then, since you say you have been told so?",
  "58438": "Now do you think I shall ever feel that for a woman?",
  "58439": "Was it not, your majesty?",
  "58440": "If I were to go to the shore some night with you do you think I could see your rock people too?",
  "58441": "Is it a large school, aunt?",
  "58442": "And how does he now regard the matter?",
  "58443": "I am not I?",
  "58444": "What's he about, I wonder?",
  "58445": "Don't you see the golden city and the everlasting day?",
  "58446": "What's in here?",
  "58447": "Why are you in hopes?",
  "58448": "How has this been done, monsieur?",
  "58449": "Who but I?",
  "58450": "Do you not know, then, how tenderly I love you, my dear, noble brother?",
  "58451": "Is the matter serious?",
  "58452": "What new master is this they have found?",
  "58453": "Will he marry her?",
  "58454": "And how could it be otherwise?",
  "58455": "You never were in it?",
  "58456": "How explain that?",
  "58457": "But have we changed as a nation even in our time?",
  "58458": "Said she, is the creature begging me off from insult?",
  "58459": "Were any other lives lost?",
  "58460": "Why should I work hard when that lazy fellow gets the same pay that I do and does only half as much work?",
  "58461": "You won't be forced to go to law with him, I hope, brother?",
  "58462": "To penal servitude?",
  "58463": "If, on the contrary, there is wealth which is not the product of labor, why is the possession of it a privilege?",
  "58464": "D'ye want to look at 'em?",
  "58465": "What is there to hinder?",
  "58466": "HOW was he going to come to her?",
  "58467": "Did he hurt you?",
  "58468": "What brings you up to town?",
  "58469": "Why must I live?",
  "58470": "You swear it won't hurt me?",
  "58471": "How can I do that?",
  "58472": "Is that why you called him a humbug, just now?",
  "58473": "Who could resist his power?",
  "58474": "What then is that about which we ought to employ our serious pains?",
  "58475": "But we are quite friendly?",
  "58476": "You give me your word of honor not to go?",
  "58477": "Me too?",

  "58479": "Have I disgraced myself in any way?",
  "58480": "Yes, said she, and mine too, I suppose, sir?",
  "58481": "Is he dead?",
  "58482": "You are a foreigner, are you not?",
  "58483": "Was it ever there?",
  "58484": "What impression have I made upon your fancy?",
  "58485": "Are you arrested for much, sir?",
  "58486": "You have got some building of your own I dare say, now?",
  "58487": "For whom alone ought we to fear?",
  "58488": "Do you think anything else was to be expected of them?",
  "58489": "Don't you want me?",
  "58490": "How does it become me, well?",
  "58491": "What would you do with them?",
  "58492": "But what interest have you in recommending her to such a step?",
  "58493": "In health?",
  "58494": "What, you don't know?",
  "58495": "Who knows what babies will turn to?",
  "58496": "Where on earth do you see anything?",
  "58497": "That is your religion?",
  "58498": "Might it be, in the mysterious ways of spiritual life, that her soul at those same moments had been conscious of his homage?",
  "58499": "Will you promise not to shoot till we've done?",
  "58500": "What's the next step?",
  "58501": "What are you up to?",
  "58502": "Will you stop your noise?",
  "58503": "That's my business, isn't it?",
  "58504": "Where did you get it?",
  "58505": "Friends?",
  "58506": "Could you start at once?",
  "58507": "I ruined?",
  "58508": "You expected me, didn't you?",
  "58509": "Might it bite him fatally?",
  "58510": "What's the matter with you this evening, dear?",
  "58511": "Can I be of any service?",
  "58512": "Where in that place in the country, by the way?",
  "58513": "You killed that woman?",
  "58514": "Does she really think of adopting teaching as a profession?",
  "58515": "Why did I not understand?",
  "58516": "What surprise?",
  "58517": "Where is the mother?",
  "58518": "But how, if there were no people?",
  "58519": "I wonder WHY it wouldn't do?",
  "58520": "Whom had she gone forth to meet?",
  "58521": "Weren't you already standing out there yesterday, greeting me?",
  "58522": "Will you go inside first and join the suitors, leaving me here behind you, or will you wait here and let me go in first?",
  "58523": "What do you think about imperial defence?",
  "58524": "If I go among my workmen, can they talk to me?",
  "58525": "Is it fraudulent to mix wines?",
  "58526": "Why was he there?",
  "58527": "You're no yoursel' the day?",
  "58528": "Was he dead?",
  "58529": "This is your first child, I take it?",
  "58530": "Do you not read them?",
  "58531": "To which of the gulfs did he nod his head?",
  "58532": "But where's the harm, if he likes it?",
  "58533": "You've been to see her?",
  "58534": "You know what it is, then?",
  "58535": "What is the use of a statue if it cannot keep the rain off?",
  "58536": "Where is the road now, and its merry incidents of life?",
  "58537": "When am I to see her?",
  "58538": "But who says you are driven away, or that you are exiled?",
  "58539": "Shall we resort to entreaty and humble supplication?",
  "58540": "Or in his voice?",
  "58541": "What's the meaning of it all?",
  "58542": "And what is the meaning of the two lines which almost immediately follow?",
  "58543": "Would they pass near enough to be able to solve certain physical and geological questions until then insoluble?",
  "58544": "Could she?",
  "58545": "Oh, why did I ever try to learn this man's secret?",
  "58546": "What are we, you ask, and what our life?",
  "58547": "Why, in that instant, did I not extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly bestowed?",
  "58548": "Did you enjoy your lunch?",
  "58549": "Of the other king's?",
  "58550": "Anna, is this you?",
  "58551": "And where would that lead her?",
  "58552": "Shall I ever be as happy as here with ye?",
  "58553": "And have you fixed your habitation in this distant land?",
  "58554": "And why then don't you think so now?",
  "58555": "And will you swear it?",
  "58556": "How could she refuse him just because he was about thirty pounds overweight?",
  "58557": "Who did you say it was?",
  "58558": "And could we go farther than to the moon if we wanted to?",
  "58559": "Ferdishenko has gone, you say?",
  "58560": "How's your discussion society getting on?",
  "58561": "Are you apprehensive of the new sphere you are about to enter?",
  "58562": "Well, are you satisfied?",
  "58563": "Are you going to him?",
  "58564": "Is it rational?",
  "58565": "Who did that?",
  "58566": "Have you REALLY?",
  "58567": "Can you repair this wheel immediately?",
  "58568": "Because it has a particular quality which no other has?",
  "58569": "Why would she have me killed?",
  "58570": "Come where?",
  "58571": "Hitched to a cabriolet?",
  "58572": "Do they believe that at each supposed act of creation one individual or many were produced?",
  "58573": "What were we going to do?",
  "58574": "Had his wife a private fortune?",
  "58575": "And the government is the ruling power in each state?",
  "58576": "You don't?",
  "58577": "Are you always in the country?",
  "58578": "And we are going to wait too?",

  "58581": "Have you ever had occasion to study character in handwriting?",
  "58582": "Where's that robin as is callin' us?",
  "58583": "Of whom are you speaking?",
  "58584": "The difficulty of my enjoyment of that is, don't you see?",
  "58585": "But you said you had no commission from her?",
  "58586": "Would you like me to send her there?",
  "58587": "And is it that liquid that is going to blow up our rocks?",
  "58588": "Do you take?",
  "58589": "And what is the difficulty now?",
  "58590": "By the way what about the political rights of these folk under your schemes?",
  "58591": "And what do you intend to do?",
  "58592": "So the rascal ran off, eh?",
  "58593": "Where is the foundling's father hidden?",
  "58594": "Talk?",
  "58595": "How are you getting along?",
  "58596": "But if so, why do you degrade yourself to serve this dirty foreigner, when you at least saw the last of a genuine national gentry?",
  "58597": "Did no one hear him move?",
  "58598": "Do you hear me, sir?",
  "58599": "What are you plotting against me?",
  "58600": "Are we surprised that a multitude of proselytes should embrace the doctrine and the passions of an eloquent fanatic?",
  "58601": "Now, did you ever hear the like since you were born?",
  "58602": "What court?",
  "58603": "But what can be done about it?",
  "58604": "Has not the experience of centuries confirmed his opinion?",
  "58605": "And now that you understand the situation, what do you advise me to do?",
  "58606": "What is sadder than a dead house, with its skeleton standing bare and sinister?",
  "58607": "Besides, what trouble is there at all in doing this?",
  "58608": "Is it a job, or a boy at marbles?",
  "58609": "You found it?",
  "58610": "There are tints in the clouds this evening, violets and blues, which are very beautiful, are they not, my friend?",
  "58611": "To lie 'for' her?",
  "58612": "But such being the case, why should she take on herself to cater for the amusement of people of such degraded tastes?",
  "58613": "You remember the place, my father?",
  "58614": "Who has?",
  "58615": "A fish of the sea or river?",
  "58616": "Was the island still inhabited by the castaway to whose succor they had come?",
  "58617": "Well, sir?",
  "58618": "Why, what is the meaning of such desperate passions?",
  "58619": "Ah, why indeed?",
  "58620": "There are so many paths leading to heaven, who knows which is the right one?",
  "58621": "Can human nature be constructed on lines so insignificant?",
  "58622": "And after all, what harm does it do?",
  "58623": "Troop?",
  "58624": "Why should she answer any such question?",
  "58625": "And is the reason known?",
  "58626": "Why can't the woman leave us alone?",
  "58627": "But if she does, what can I say to her?",
  "58628": "How, master?",
  "58629": "I suppose you have your composition all done?",
  "58630": "And are we come to that degree of misery, that our enemies themselves are expected to pity us?",
  "58631": "What did he do after he had wept?",
  "58632": "'If' you've been mistaken, you say?",
  "58633": "Isn't it good?",
  "58634": "And what should I do with these?",
  "58635": "When do you think he ever told her that before?",
  "58636": "Would you come round with me to the registry office?",
  "58637": "But who are these strangers with you?",
  "58638": "And why is he doing this to me?",
  "58639": "Why, what age do you call that little creature?",
  "58640": "What sort of a new life can you and I look forward to?",
  "58641": "Why didn't you go down yesterday?",
  "58642": "Missis has got dem bills?",
  "58643": "What's that after his name?",
  "58644": "What are you laughing at?",
  "58645": "First, will your ladyship allow me to ask you whether you have had any strange visitors this morning?",
  "58646": "But who will assert, that this is the only foundation of justice?",
  "58647": "Is it far off?",
  "58648": "Are you less cold now?",
  "58649": "How many steps have you told?",
  "58650": "Is it the form of the thing?",
  "58651": "Do the buyers pay before they bring away the things?",
  "58652": "How, my fault?",
  "58653": "Where did ye get your finishing, my dear?",
  "58654": "And the meal?",
  "58655": "What have I done, that I should be the only mark of your cruelty?",
  "58656": "Was there no one in the churchyard?",
  "58657": "Well, what would she have now?",
  "58658": "What trick is this?",
  "58659": "Are the guns ready?",
  "58660": "Will you be so good as to pledge me, sir?",
  "58661": "With her?",
  "58662": "Where is the key you speak of?",
  "58663": "But where are the antennæ you spoke of?",
  "58664": "When did you come back?",
  "58665": "Not an ill wind, I hope?",
  "58666": "Eustacia?",
  "58667": "As you truly say, if we were to act in this way, what would the world come to?",
  "58668": "Oh, where shall we meet?",
  "58669": "Well, have you sent?",
  "58670": "Or why should it be forbidden that he gaze upon the sea?",
  "58671": "If I had one that I could and ought to have revealed, should I not have long ago divulged it?",
  "58672": "How can one say what seed of good may have been dropped into his soul, never to die?",
  "58673": "Do you preach them?",
  "58674": "Would you like to be a lovely young girl?",
  "58675": "Where should they go?",
  "58676": "Why such a terrible misfortune?",
  "58677": "What should he do about his skimming?",
  "58678": "How much did the stiff have in his bags?",
  "58679": "Why won't you tell me?",
  "58680": "You have tried to find him, then?",
  "58681": "Which side of his life did he resolve upon closing and condemning?",
  "58682": "And what is the name which the city derives from the possession of this sort of knowledge?",
  "58683": "What do you call him again?",
  "58684": "What about the hole?",
  "58685": "At the oars?",
  "58686": "You think I'm afraid of you and your cattle, don't you?",
  "58687": "To you?",
  "58688": "What is this leather cleaned with?",
  "58689": "Whar is you?",
  "58690": "How can people be dissatisfied with anything?",
  "58691": "What's to become of us?",
  "58692": "That I loved you?",
  "58693": "Geraldine, do you remember that still?",
  "58694": "Why does the floor seem hollowed out at this spot?",
  "58695": "Sagacious too?",
  "58696": "Well, have you anything more?",
  "58697": "What's the difference?",
  "58698": "What does it matter whether I forgive you?",
  "58699": "But, that being so, why did you offer?",

  "60303": "Set out?",
  "60304": "Yet did I not first roughly kiss her as we danced?",
  "60305": "Well, and what may you have to say against this name?",
  "60306": "How do you like them?",
  "60307": "And he who is not on a voyage has no need of a pilot?",
  "60308": "But who will lead?",
  "60309": "You'll get plenty of fresh air, won't you?",
  "60310": "But, my dear, is not this rather out of character?",
  "60311": "Or a woman?",
  "60312": "Well, if so, why do you object to my doing so?",
  "60313": "Are you the boy I've read of in the papers?",
  "60314": "Oh, what's wrong?",
  "60315": "What's the use?",
  "60316": "And if he let go his hold?",
  "60317": "In what way has it a tendency to prove that?",
  "60318": "Who is at the door other than he?",
  "60319": "Are you still resolved to accompany me?",
  "60320": "She's such a splendid woman, isn't she?",
  "60321": "What does he do?",
  "60322": "Why did you keep me waiting so long?",
  "60323": "Can I say of her innocent and girlish beauty, that it faded, and was no more, when its breath falls on my cheek now, as it fell that night?",
  "60324": "Do you know why?",
  "60325": "Why, what's the MATTER with you?",
  "60326": "My dear friend, what has happened?",
  "60327": "You had no idea of your impending good fortune, in those times?",
  "60328": "Nice?",
  "60329": "May its poppet come in and talk?",
  "60330": "And what was it this time last year?",
  "60331": "Don't you care for me at all?",
  "60332": "But what is theory?",
  "60333": "Then, sir, you are satisfied?",
  "60334": "And what if he had?",
  "60335": "And why is he here?",
  "60336": "That is your final decision?",
  "60337": "Do you remember what fun it often was when guests came in the evening?",
  "60338": "How long ago?",
  "60339": "Well, how can I he of service to you?",
  "60340": "What was the use of squandering the days of his youth in an office when the world was beautiful?",
  "60341": "But, tell me, have they all one motion, both situ et tempore?",
  "60342": "And you selected it yourself?",
  "60343": "I know it, but in asking for news, I mean, have you done anything for me?",
  "60344": "What on earth have I done now?",
  "60345": "When does it become an idolum specus, the unreasonable pertinacity of a too sceptical mind?",
  "60346": "When will he be here?",
  "60347": "Something extraordinary must await us farther on, but, what?",
  "60348": "When shall I wake?",
  "60349": "What had he come there to do?",
  "60350": "And how stands the fact?",
  "60351": "Do you ever work, child?",
  "60352": "You hear, sir?",
  "60353": "What would you do if you were in my place?",
  "60354": "The gentleman to whom I had the honour of being introduced?",
  "60355": "Not to see the father?",
  "60356": "Will you overlook it this once and forgive me, and let things go on as before?",
  "60357": "What am I to tell him?",
  "60358": "Won't you find it an awful nuisance to look after a baby?",
  "60359": "Where do you come from?",
  "60360": "And what did you say about it, bishop?",
  "60361": "Then why are we here, my friends?",
  "60362": "Boats in the royal service?",
  "60363": "What is your religion?",
  "60364": "Must it not, indeed, be told to the whole circle of her acquaintance before she could be made to stand all right with them?",
  "60365": "Verily, do I still live?",
  "60366": "All as it should be, is it not?",
  "60367": "Is that strong on him still?",
  "60368": "Do you want to go to all of them?",
  "60369": "What does tha' know about him?",
  "60370": "What shall I think of this?",
  "60371": "Come, now, what do you want?",
  "60372": "Daae not see you come down from your room by the curious road which you selected?",
  "60373": "But as a man of honor should answer another, tell me fairly, shall you pay these with the same punctuality?",
  "60374": "And when doth this take place?",
  "60375": "But his stables had been searched?",
  "60376": "But, it will be asked further, can I make any use of this conception and hypothesis in my investigations into the world and nature?",
  "60377": "Of his own desire?",
  "60378": "Why should anyone pay?",
  "60379": "What do you wish of me?",
  "60380": "Such work is healthy, isn't it, sir?",
  "60381": "Pay?",
  "60382": "Home?",
  "60383": "And when?",
  "60384": "Then why should he be persecuted?",
  "60385": "Does aught lie on it?",
  "60386": "That's frank, isn't it?",
  "60387": "Where have you sprung up from?",
  "60388": "To what class of society does he belong?",
  "60389": "How come?",
  "60390": "Where now are all your high resolves at last?",
  "60391": "And will no murmurs fill the courts above?",
  "60392": "When?",
  "60393": "Marriage?",
  "60394": "Then that is all quite settled, is it not?",
  "60395": "Have you told master that you heard a laugh?",
  "60396": "Or cometh it in person?",
  "60397": "What more can we do?",
  "60398": "What in the world does the man mean?",
  "60399": "What does anybody want here?",
  "60400": "Why, do you know how pretty you are, child?",
  "60401": "Will you not allow that I have as much of the spirit of prophecy in me as the swans?",
  "60402": "Shall we wait, or shall we charge?",
  "60403": "Ere I was old?",
  "60404": "Do you know his man?",
  "60405": "Will you so?",
  "60406": "Who are the true martyrs, of those who are slain on my side, or on that of my enemies?",
  "60407": "Well, what hinders your sleeping?",
  "60408": "And you'll be my friend?",
  "60409": "May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?",
  "60410": "What do you mean to say?",
  "60411": "Ain't I a crow?",
  "60412": "How about prying?",
  "60413": "Then he could not have retreated down the road, and you say that there are no side roads?",
  "60414": "Qui est ton pere?",
  "60415": "Yea, why should his father let him, if it come to that?",
  "60416": "Briefly, what did you glean?",
  "60417": "Didn't you see the look in his eyes when he talked about her?",
  "60418": "Gone, you say she is?",
  "60419": "Why does there come an hour when one emerges from this azure, and why does life go on afterwards?",
  "60420": "What has broken your heart?",
  "60421": "Do you think you will find that spring soon?",
  "60422": "How was I?",
  "60423": "Why doesn't he come to the house?",
  "60424": "And why do the children, the grandchildren, all the descendants of the first parents always return here?",
  "60425": "By whom?",
  "60426": "But then, what?",
  "60427": "Arm's length?",
  "60428": "Him as wos dead?",
  "60429": "What is its object?",
  "60430": "Are we never to educate ourselves to foresee such dangers and to prevent them before they happen?",
  "60431": "Do ye not feel the thirst and the hot breath of her love?",
  "60432": "So that you may both get tipsy, is that it, and stay here gabbing all day?",
  "60433": "Why was she brought here?",
  "60434": "I, my lord?",
  "60435": "And don't you know that you are prettier than you ever were?",
  "60436": "Am I really wonderful?",
  "60437": "Well, was there?",
  "60438": "What is she sentenced to?",
  "60439": "And how much for one that's all chewed up like this one?",
  "60440": "The curate?",
  "60441": "Were you alone during this conversation?",
  "60442": "Shall I have a nurse?",
  "60443": "Do you want to drown yourselves, or dash yourselves to pieces among these wheels?",
  "60444": "Was he anywhere near the big shed where we build the machines?",
  "60445": "But have we hydrogen enough to inflate a balloon?",
  "60446": "Has it a copper leg?",
  "60447": "What had she better do, or how was it expedient that she should treat him?",
  "60448": "The door key?",
  "60449": "Looked?",
  "60450": "What of that?",
  "60451": "Shall we let him in or not, if you are asleep?",
  "60452": "Repellently and stunningly clever?",
  "60453": "Where could you keep it?",
  "60454": "It's all sand here, ain't it?",
  "60455": "And that of a fluid body?",
  "60456": "Had HE his idea, and has he now, with you, anything more?",
  "60457": "Who took any?",
  "60458": "Was he true to them?",
  "60459": "Why should he not?",
  "60460": "Afraid of being heard?",
  "60461": "Will this ever take place in reality?",
  "60462": "Don't you see the animal has been such an inveterate tippler that he has not only drunk the wine, but swallowed the bottle?",
  "60463": "What garden?",
  "60464": "Why should I go?",
  "60465": "On your life?",
  "60466": "No more?",
  "60467": "Is it you, sir?",
  "60468": "What did he mean by talking about favourites, then?",
  "60469": "You will wait for me, then?",
  "60470": "Was it through the chimney?",
  "60471": "But what can I do, sister?",
  "60472": "Well, are you coming?",
  "60473": "It was from your wife, we supposed?",
  "60474": "And had I wasted some of the best years of my life to obtain a shadow?",
  "60475": "It is, then, the cardinal's custom to walk in his orangery?",
  "60476": "Oh how great a confidence shall there be to the dying man whom no affection to anything detaineth in the world?",
  "60477": "He paid for them, did he not?",
  "60478": "And if the world perceives that what we are saying about him is the truth, will they be angry with philosophy?",
  "60479": "Can such men fall away from reality?",
  "60480": "Are those our barks, yonder?",
  "60481": "How dare you come here?",
  "60482": "What is a magician?",
  "60483": "Wots the consequence?",
  "60484": "And would ye hear this likewise?",
  "60485": "How can one be in doubt about what one has heard with one's own ears and seen with one's own eyes?",
  "60486": "By some happy device?",
  "60487": "Is the wind favourable?",
  "60488": "Why did you let me do such a silly thing?",
  "60489": "Have you an invite too, doctor?",
  "60490": "Why did he wish it?",
  "60491": "And suppose she does not mind her p's and q's?",
  "60492": "What makes you say that?",
  "60493": "Excuse him?",
  "60494": "Wasn't I faithful?",
  "60495": "Can you get me the grammars if I promise to say it hereabout?",
  "60496": "Would he startle him with sudden fear?",
  "60497": "How would you like to come in on that with me?",
  "60498": "But are you flesh and blood?",
  "60499": "She's not in this house, for instance?",
  "60500": "Hoo be all wi' ye?",
  "60501": "What time do you get up to get breakfast?",
  "60502": "Well, and what do you mean to do with me?",
  "60503": "Why don't you get into touch?",
  "60504": "And you went asking money of him, or making talk of getting a wife would drive him from his farm?",
  "60505": "You include the grounds about the houses?",
  "60506": "What, then, remains?",
  "60507": "But are we not made better for the effort and sacrifice, and are not those we serve lifted up and blessed?",
  "60508": "Would she have still loved this savage warrior chieftain, dancing naked among his naked savage subjects?",
  "60509": "What ship sail home to her haven?",
  "60510": "Can't you hear?",
  "60511": "If a law is wrong how are we to make its immorality evident?",
  "60512": "You hear the charge?",
  "60513": "But what do I see?",
  "60514": "Jane, you understand what I want of you?",
  "60515": "How did feudalism end?",
  "60516": "How about the license?",
  "60517": "Price?",
  "60518": "If not, where was the man, and why did he not come back?",
  "60519": "What think you sir?",
  "60520": "For what purpose are we come here?",
  "60521": "Good faith?",
  "60522": "Oh, don't you see how much nicer it would be if it was a secret?",
  "60523": "Confess what?",
  "60524": "Is this a time to be offering pardons, or renewing the long forgotten subjects of charters and taxation?",
  "60525": "Would you care to come and dine with me?",
  "60526": "What could she have done to you?",
  "60527": "And shall we begin at once?",
  "60528": "But would you be able for it, my boy?",
  "60529": "Surprised at this emphasis, I surveyed my valet, and, perceiving a wildness in his looks, asked if he had seen his grandfather's ghost?",
  "60530": "Get it ready, will you?",
  "60531": "But you could find out?",
  "60532": "Was she pretty?",
  "60533": "Or will he say that to abolish corruption is a bad thing?",
  "60534": "And why did the body conceal itself?",
  "60535": "Jo, how could you?",
  "60536": "Don't they say as there's somebody can strip it off him?",
  "60537": "Is not all here yours?",
  "60538": "What other possible reason could there have been for her so blushing ?",
  "60539": "What made him seek this quarter of the house at an untimely season, when he should have been asleep in bed?",
  "60540": "Where can they have crossed?",
  "60541": "If such things are done in the green wood, what will be done in the dry?",
  "60542": "And whom he brought back this morning?",
  "60543": "Any references?",
  "60544": "Was not he believed to be dead?",
  "60545": "With whom are you going to fight?",
  "60546": "Then don't you despair?",
  "60547": "And why think you that will make him sad?",
  "60548": "But when will you come and see my study?",
  "60549": "My friends, why with us?",
  "60550": "What a carriage that was, and where did it come from, eh?",
  "60551": "But is that all your evidence?",
  "60552": "Why did you give him six pistoles?",
  "60553": "You deny it?",
  "60554": "Do you feel that you are a sufficiently practical man?",
  "60555": "How do you mean sad?",
  "60556": "What crime, then, have you committed?",
  "60557": "Did I tell you?",
  "60558": "Fwhat are you talkin' of?",
  "60559": "How could she, indeed?",
  "60560": "Don't you hear often?",
  "60561": "But, surely, there is some one in the world whom you love?",
  "60562": "And where is his corpse?",
  "60563": "Well, do you know what is taking place at this moment?",
  "60564": "And would you like to be here alone with her for a month?",
  "60565": "Isn't it a peacock?",
  "60566": "For instance, if you lived in the penal days?",
  "60567": "I say, what on earth's the matter?",
  "60568": "She has gone to visit friends?",
  "60569": "But why did men who were interpolating bronze corslets freely introduce bronze so seldom, if at all, as the material of greaves?",
  "60570": "And the men?",
  "60571": "Do you s'pose they would?",
  "60572": "Are you making fun of me?",
  "60573": "How could he possibly have doubted it?",
  "60574": "Who ever got a letter that was worth waiting for?",
  "60575": "What is your theory, then?",
  "60576": "You've come at last, have you?",
  "60577": "How may I tell you for what we were sunk here, when I do not know, unless it was because we were rich?",
  "60578": "But what good can one do oneself?",
  "60579": "And you're so great a favourite there, you say?",
  "60580": "Give up?",
  "60581": "Are you sure you wouldn't like some more breakfast?",
  "60582": "When shall I have you here again?",
  "60583": "If she's charming, how can she help it?",
  "60584": "And discarding all consideration of political consequences, what unspeakable personal glory there would then be to him as a man?",
  "60585": "You'll not tell, will you?",
  "60586": "How could she ever suppose such a thing?",
  "60587": "Was it the same desperate confusion, or would the ground offer better facilities?",
  "60588": "Kill that boy?",
  "60589": "Why, but will you leave him with so slight command, and infuse no more charge upon the fellow?",
  "60590": "Sherry or 'ock, sir?",
  "60591": "You have the unspeakable effrontery to stand there and admit it?",
  "60592": "True?",
  "60593": "Very distant?",
  "60594": "Does his conscience ever entertain the question of his right to such subsidies?",
  "60595": "How shall I defile them?",
  "60596": "Can you strike a man to the heart and leave no mark on him?",
  "60597": "Do you know whence comes our real power?",
  "60598": "You don't suppose she could take any interest in you, do you?",
  "60599": "What's your hurry?",
  "60600": "If it be, how can that question have place, concerning the subsistence of self, under a change of substance?",
  "60601": "That?",
  "60602": "And in what light must I appear to the world?",
  "60603": "Marilla, have I really a pretty nose?",
  "60604": "On the other hand, what do we see?",
  "60605": "But what should we have been then?",
  "60606": "For are not milliners and mantuamakers reckoned the next class?",
  "60607": "She used to speak of me then?",
  "60608": "Could I ever forget?",
  "60609": "You think not, sir?",
  "60610": "Ran away with her?",
  "60611": "But do you?",
  "60612": "What sort of weather was it?",
  "60613": "And all for what?",
  "60614": "So that was the way they did it, eh?",
  "60615": "What admission?",
  "60616": "To make the people laugh?",
  "60617": "How can we get it?",
  "60618": "When shall we be governed?",
  "60619": "To enter in the wall?",
  "60620": "Is it important business?",
  "60621": "How dare you, sir, break it?",
  "60622": "You can think of, and remember her?",
  "60623": "Would you not sooner stay with me than with them?",
  "60624": "To whom, then?",
  "60625": "Do you fear that they might be stolen?",
  "60626": "Does she know it?",
  "60627": "What do you think of me?",
  "60628": "Who is it, and what's wanted?",
  "60629": "How it happened?",
  "60630": "What is it gives her the power to look down on everything, to be calm independently of everything?",
  "60631": "Tom, what is the matter?",
  "60632": "If upon the ocean, would any passing vessel be within hail to rescue them from their critical position?",
  "60633": "What is the use of your exertion, they would say, in accumulating wealth, which is doomed to melt away in the twinkling of an eye?",
  "60634": "But if you yourselves should be struck?",
  "60635": "Don't you see how his back is laden?",
  "60636": "Where shall the little boy ride to?",
  "60637": "And you owned up?",
  "60638": "Why did you, if you regret it?",
  "60639": "Now you know me, don't you?",
  "60640": "May I see if they have more scent than the others?",
  "60641": "To do what?",
  "60642": "Oh say, what sums that generous hand supply?",
  "60643": "You did at last?",
  "60644": "Hadn't we better go?",
  "60645": "But what must be done?",
  "60646": "Is there no wizardry within it?",
  "60647": "Davy?",
  "60648": "What position do you hold?",
  "60649": "Do you mean I'm to clean pots and pans and things?",
  "60650": "Why don't you go away with him?",
  "60651": "Is it empty?",
  "60652": "But how to get to him in safety?",
  "60653": "After all, thirty cents isn't much, eh what?",
  "60654": "Wouldn't you punish children at all, when they misbehaved?",
  "60655": "And why did he fire at us?",
  "60656": "Has he built one here, then?",
  "60657": "Will that satisfy you?",
  "60658": "Soft, who be these?",
  "60659": "What upon earth is to make them so?",
  "60660": "James's?",
  "60661": "Is your father in?",
  "60662": "Why were you treated so?",
  "60663": "And is that all, papa?",
  "60664": "Isn't that a nice imaginative name?",
  "60665": "The poorest?",
  "60666": "What's up now?",
  "60667": "You'll come out after supper, won't you?",
  "60668": "Don't you know the temptation to say frightful and shocking things just for the mere sake of saying them?",
  "60669": "You are going on a journey?",
  "60670": "You think it right, then, that your niece should throw herself in his way?",
  "60671": "Stronger then he was wont?",
  "60672": "And if you keep it under your skirts like that, who's to help tumbling?",
  "60673": "And the worthy man destroyed your compromising letter?",
  "60674": "Mary what, doctor?",
  "60675": "How can you say that, sir?",
  "60676": "Nay, why external for internal given?",
  "60677": "What would it profit a woman, for example, to get him a few months' imprisonment if her own ruin must immediately follow?",
  "60678": "What kind of people?",
  "60679": "And why did she weep so bitterly?",
  "60680": "Is this modesty?",
  "60681": "Whatever was it I was disputing about?",
  "60682": "Well now, what are you going to do about it?",
  "60683": "Indeed, who is free from them?",
  "60684": "Is this the way to the princesses' apartments?",
  "60685": "What have you been doing that you shouldn't?",
  "60686": "But why this singular vision, if the portrait is a faithful copy of the original?",
  "60687": "Tell me, if you please, what seems to cause you so much joy?",
  "60688": "But would you mind letting me hold your hand?",
  "60689": "Would he be in a position to marry?",
  "60690": "What about, sir?",
  "60691": "Then why go there?",
  "60692": "Has a crime been committed?",
  "60693": "Where should she turn for advice and counsel?",
  "60694": "Doctor, would it be proper to ask what is your secret?",
  "60695": "Do you like him any better?",
  "60696": "Was the lady crying?",
  "60697": "What's on your mind?",

  "60939": "Shall we let him say it, or not?",
  "60940": "HIM an injury?",
  "60941": "How meaning?",
  "60942": "You'd never think it, to look at him now, would you?",

  "61015": "How could it occur to her to examine the letter, to look at it critically as a profession of love?",
  "61016": "Since you had already given the matter publicity, why did you object just now, when I began to speak of it to my friends?",
  "61017": "So that old scoundrel's dead, is he?",
  "61018": "I suppose she doesn't think that I'm to have all the sweat and that she is to have all the profit?",

  "61118": "What for this time?",
  "61119": "Do I win?",
  "61120": "What do you make of it?",
  "61121": "Might I trouble you for a match?",
  "61122": "Well, and then where did you go?",

  "61172": "But you do forgive me?",
  "61173": "Is it probable that such a combination would exist at all?",
  "61174": "Then the fun would begin?",
  "61175": "What papers d'you write for?",
  "61176": "What's wrong with you?",
  "61177": "Wouldn't it be nice if roses could talk?",
  "61178": "Will your folks worry?",

  "61196": "Is there none who holds the secret of these terrible bars?",
  "61197": "But she can make him keep her if he's married her?",
  "61198": "Was it right, for the sake of either of them, that an offer of marriage should be made at such a moment as this?",
  "61199": "You wouldn't, you mean, have been where you are?",
  "61200": "What, what's the truth?",
  "61201": "Why didn't he take you with him?",
  "61202": "To join the hussars?",
  "61203": "Wasn't her father meanwhile only pretending to talk of it?",
  "61204": "Will you give me a rose?",
  "61205": "Why is that?",

  "61234": "Would it be right for me to do so too?",
  "61235": "But why did you come hither?",
  "61236": "And sometimes with thy virtuous master, I suppose?",

  "61242": "Do you want to spread it all over?",
  "61243": "Is not this indeed, to understand charity well?",
  "61244": "On what principle is it that, when we see nothing but improvement behind us, we are to expect nothing but deterioration before us?",
  "61245": "If it is, in what does that necessity consist, what service does it perform, what is its business, and what are its merits?",
  "61246": "You are a financier, monsieur, I believe?",
  "61247": "Are you the gentleman?",
  "61248": "You can lend your old father a horse I dare say, youngster, can't you?",
  "61249": "D'ye think so?",

  "61275": "What, has she been here?",
  "61276": "You won't mind sleeping with such a very young woman, grandmother?",
  "61277": "Fernand, do you mean?",
  "61278": "And also to be within and between them?",
  "61279": "Was this possible or that possible?",
  "61280": "You call me a cobweb?",

  "61307": "Who's that?",
  "61308": "Can you tell me?",
  "61309": "Or is she an elfish spirit, who, as the legends of our childhood taught us, is forbidden to cross a running stream?",
  "61310": "Why ask me?",
  "61311": "Which means?",
  "61312": "Will he agree?",

  "61330": "Wait, haven't you dropped it?",
  "61331": "The garden?",
  "61332": "Do you think it's possible?",
  "61333": "You didn't either of you say anything about other matters?",
  "61334": "I suppose they were government matches, then?",
  "61335": "You knew him?",
  "61336": "What was the fair lady's game?",

  "61340": "A great man?",
  "61341": "How did you get in if both houses were empty?",
  "61342": "Where could she be?",
  "61343": "Will you take me in your company?",
  "61344": "Isn't that so?",
  "61345": "How do you expect me to know such things?",
  "61346": "Then the just soul and the just man will live well, and the unjust man will live ill?",

  "61354": "Have you turned the case over in your mind?",
  "61355": "Why should I not confess it, gentlemen?",
  "61356": "Am I worse than I believe myself to be?",
  "61357": "How about moving that drugget?",
  "61358": "But you had a gun and bayonet besides?",
  "61359": "Do I sing?",

  "61375": "And the women?",
  "61376": "Suppose I do not want to be happy, what is the source of the obligation?",
  "61377": "Or the generous deed out of selfishness?",
  "61378": "Were you sent here to praise me?",
  "61379": "How do you feel now, dear?",
  "61380": "She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?",
  "61381": "You know him, then?",
  "61382": "Will he always come when you call him?",
  "61383": "And what has that to do with me?",
  "61384": "Why compliment him on being a romantic reactionary aristocrat?",
  "61385": "In the first place, and before everything else, sir, is the news as bad in your opinion as I am asked to believe?",
  "61386": "But how was it that the grooms knew it?",
  "61387": "Will you appoint a meeting for six months hence?",
  "61388": "Find it easy?",
  "61389": "Were they going over to the other side?",
  "61390": "So you will send me that book, dear count?",
  "61391": "But it's over now?",
  "61392": "Am I talking?",
  "61393": "And to what?",
  "61394": "Have I always hated you so much?",

  "61396": "You will sing with me?",
  "61397": "Grant?",
  "61398": "I say, you don't happen to have heard of a murder?",
  "61399": "What did I borrow?",
  "61400": "Am I not clearly designated in that, captain?",
  "61401": "And with what purpose could he do that?",
  "61402": "What is it that this polypragmonetic ardelion to all the fiends of hell doth aim at?",
  "61403": "What has happened that you should speak like that?",
  "61404": "What means, then, this dithyramb upon property?",
  "61405": "And where afterwards?",
  "61406": "What reason was there for assuming any probability of an uprising in the city?",
  "61407": "Is it not a canonical and authentic exception, worthy to be premised to all our undertakings?",
  "61408": "Ah, friends, what shall I do?",
  "61409": "Do we not both take from the poor people that which they can ill spare?",
  "61410": "What is the place, then, upon which we stand?",
  "61411": "Is he a man of fortune?",
  "61412": "How dare to repeat experiments that had failed so often?",
  "61413": "There is still another influence, what do you say to that?",
  "61414": "What makes you ask?",
  "61415": "Killed?",
  "61416": "See you not, you goblins, that your lord and master is here?",
  "61417": "Now, who can this other letter be from?",
  "61418": "But how is it he is not already returned?",
  "61419": "What is to be the manner of her death?",
  "61420": "Wizard?",
  "61421": "And, conversely, that which has less of truth will also have less of essence?",
  "61422": "You mean that they would shipwreck?",
  "61423": "Didn't you yourself bring her the contract?",
  "61424": "Swinging by the chain?",
  "61425": "What put it into your head, little mother?",
  "61426": "You don't mean to say he's here?",
  "61427": "Then it is very thin wine?",
  "61428": "Did I offer to hit him or did I not?",
  "61429": "And what temperature may that be?",
  "61430": "Have you a pair of silent shoes?",
  "61431": "Who else should do so?",
  "61432": "And to what effect?",
  "61433": "I shall meet them there, and who knows what future advantages may result from the interview?",
  "61434": "Could it have been aught but a shipwreck which had drawn it under the water?",
  "61435": "The song?",
  "61436": "Shall you go?",
  "61437": "How are you, my dear?",
  "61438": "Ain't that a shame, sir?",
  "61439": "Why then not trace the rights of man to the creation of man?",
  "61440": "How did you know about it?",
  "61441": "What was the worthy geographer thinking of?",
  "61442": "How about that?",
  "61443": "Who knows it?",
  "61444": "You were alluding to the jerking movement of my hand every time I try to reach for anything?",
  "61445": "What the devil was you afraid of?",
  "61446": "What did he do before he went?",
  "61447": "Your alphabet?",
  "61448": "What's up?",
  "61449": "Which house is that?",
  "61450": "What's your real name?",
  "61451": "Why were they so strangely silent?",
  "61452": "Is it an amusing story?",
  "61453": "You were, were you not?",
  "61454": "Do you find the answer?",
  "61455": "At last she is dead?",
  "61456": "Do you mean to say you couldn't love me then?",
  "61457": "Don't you hear to what soft whispers the wind has fallen?",
  "61458": "Time to start?",
  "61459": "Wasn't it as good as a marriage?",
  "61460": "You understand?",
  "61461": "But how did you know that I was a prisoner back there?",
  "61462": "Wherein?",
  "61463": "Which do you prefer?",
  "61464": "What can be more gratifying than such a retrospect as this?",
  "61465": "What did she say?",
  "61466": "Oh, indeed?",
  "61467": "Besides, which am I to choose?",
  "61468": "Go to?",
  "61469": "But how could I, a poor dazed village lad, avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best and wisest of men fall every day?",
  "61470": "Well, why not?",
  "61471": "What does it all mean?",
  "61472": "I may assume that there is a second to be mentioned?",
  "61473": "And it's a very pretty name, don't you think?",
  "61474": "Your father is dead?",
  "61475": "Of whom?",
  "61476": "Natasha, you would not deceive me?",
  "61477": "What were you doing in the battle, my friend?",
  "61478": "But does not this expose himself more than me?",
  "61479": "And is not this the reason why of old love has been called a tyrant?",
  "61480": "What are you doing here?",
  "61481": "Why not take a number of banths and set them loose before us above ground?",
  "61482": "How long did he wear it?",
  "61483": "Is he not a prey which will always be within your grasp?",
  "61484": "What instructing do you think I should do?",
  "61485": "What took her away?",
  "61486": "Yes, how long?",
  "61487": "Is it not the separation of soul and body?",
  "61488": "It is said to have been a congestion of the brain, or apoplexy, which is the same thing, is it not?",
  "61489": "Executions?",
  "61490": "Have commissioned you to tell me what you have just stated?",
  "61491": "Remorse or regret?",
  "61492": "How am I to describe it?",
  "61493": "Tulkinghorn?",
  "61494": "Why are you smiling, prince?",
  "61495": "And if he had not, why did he take her again?",
  "61496": "That is your intention, is it not?",
  "61497": "Will it pass?",
  "61498": "Why did you pick him?",
  "61499": "Do you suppose these stoneless mounds hide no dust of what were men just as good?",
  "61500": "Where are those passionate eyes that appeal'd to my eyes in passion?",

  "62702": "Where am I to join on?",
  "62703": "What right have you to bid me leave this house, sir?",
  "62704": "Who would endure this for many lives?",
  "62705": "Which is best off?",
  "62706": "Tell me, where is the place that men call hell?",
  "62707": "Then will she die too?",
  "62708": "Need it be said that no such measures could destroy that tendency?",
  "62709": "Od's precious, come away, man, what do you mean?",
  "62710": "May I go and help carry the things to the poor little children?",
  "62711": "Have heard them say that there is nothing pleasanter than to get rid of their pain?",
  "62712": "Who could see?",
  "62713": "Have you any more to stake?",
  "62714": "What shall you tell her?",
  "62715": "What like is he?",
  "62716": "Is this of envy or no?",
  "62717": "Why, WHY do they torment me and say I am going to marry you?",
  "62718": "If I went to sleep as I proposed, how could the atmosphere in the chamber be regenerated in the interim?",
  "62719": "I suppose you have searched her desk and things?",
  "62720": "I mean can't you put on your own clothes?",
  "62721": "What, after all, was this new oath?",
  "62722": "What then are we to conclude from these facts and considerations?",
  "62723": "How might it fare more gently with you in all the world?",
  "62724": "What avarice?",
  "62725": "Hurt me?",
  "62726": "Who's not playing fair?",
  "62727": "They were none of them among our friends at the lodge, then?",
  "62728": "Has it been so kept?",
  "62729": "So you are going away in the fall?",
  "62730": "In the flesh?",
  "62731": "Wouldn't you teach them to play on the piano, and paint on velvet?",
  "62732": "Where is my wife?",
  "62733": "Where is my native place?",
  "62734": "And had he married the valiant matron's daughter, as he promised?",
  "62735": "Everything's made to be played, with and broken, isn't it, young 'un?",
  "62736": "Whatcher take me for, hey?",
  "62737": "What do you mean, the rabbit?",
  "62738": "Now what do you say?",
  "62739": "And what sort of men do they graduate?",
  "62740": "He knew then?",
  "62741": "What was she insolent about?",
  "62742": "You don't hesitate to take a place at my side, do you?",
  "62743": "Daze my eyes, and isn't there?",
  "62744": "Do you not see his heart is fast breaking?",
  "62745": "Can this be possible, uncle?",
  "62746": "Why should they?",
  "62747": "Have you forgotten the day?",
  "62748": "Do you see anything there?",
  "62749": "What is the object of this assembly?",
  "62750": "Good heavens, are you ill?",
  "62751": "Well, did you dig up the watch?",
  "62752": "You will arrest him?",
  "62753": "And aren't you?",
  "62754": "What uncanny secret did it hold?",
  "62755": "Why is she thus possessed, and why does she not spare herself?",
  "62756": "But won't you speak to him?",
  "62757": "At any rate, you have some walks in the neighbourhood?",
  "62758": "You have been a soldier?",
  "62759": "But why a year?",
  "62760": "Who's that laughing at me?",
  "62761": "Where, then, would have been her navy, her trade and even her existence?",
  "62762": "What do you hear from your mother?",
  "62763": "How could I settle the point forever?",
  "62764": "What does that spell?",
  "62765": "He means to marry you?",
  "62766": "But would that be necessary?",
  "62767": "What did happen?",
  "62768": "Is the shepherd said to be just to his sheep and his dogs?",
  "62769": "Why do you keep the secrets of that man, when they mean death to so many?",
  "62770": "But if I pursue and nothing gain, what will it profit me to come up with him?",
  "62771": "Do you wish to get out?",
  "62772": "Clara, are you ready to come home?",
  "62773": "Did you ever hear of such ingratitude?",
  "62774": "The best school?",
  "62775": "Get me up, can't ye?",
  "62776": "Bread?",
  "62777": "Dare they to hope a poet for their friend?",
  "62778": "What do I deduce from this?",
  "62779": "When did that person come here, waiter?",
  "62780": "What has made you so disobedient and unfaithful?",
  "62781": "You're not in bed?",
  "62782": "What spot?",
  "62783": "Did he believe?",
  "62784": "And now, is this all you have to tell me?",
  "62785": "Could he forego the renown of being the first wit of his age?",
  "62786": "What was he hoping for?",
  "62787": "What name am I to say?",
  "62788": "Elm or fir, both of which abounded in the island?",
  "62789": "And why will they not?",
  "62790": "A new one?",
  "62791": "What if you should die first?",
  "62792": "As day by day the sun sank lower and lower in the sky, could he be certain that the luminary would ever retrace his heavenly road?",
  "62793": "Had they nothing else to say to one another?",
  "62794": "Who told you to steal?",
  "62795": "Did I not tell you how quick and resolute she was?",
  "62796": "Is there any example of an individual object that escaped the government of that law in the whole history of the world?",
  "62797": "Why tarry ye?",
  "62798": "Did he give a reason?",
  "62799": "How did you come here?",
  "62800": "Did I break through one of your rings, that you spread that damned ice on the causeway?",
  "62801": "He asked himself, or were they playing a part?",
  "62802": "Is it true that my mind is only a harmony, and my soul a vortex?",
  "62803": "But if I do fight, you will surely not object to giving me a lesson or two in shooting and fencing?",
  "62804": "Are we women?",
  "62805": "Ah, but it isn't, is it?",
  "62806": "Have you more to say?",
  "62807": "What had really happened?",
  "62808": "How if his death were occasioned by a wound received in defending his master?",
  "62809": "For what is there more prompt, more unexpected, more abbreviatory of space and time, than the maturity of an obligation?",
  "62810": "Would they be right in the future?",
  "62811": "And isn't he?",
  "62812": "And what do you say is your surmise as to your present position?",
  "62813": "Suppose now I ask, why I rather than anybody else?",
  "62814": "If what?",
  "62815": "Have you a heart?",
  "62816": "With me?",
  "62817": "Did you ever hear of such an idea?",
  "62818": "Have you quite forgotten her?",
  "62819": "Haven't they hurt his feelings?",
  "62820": "Won't you come in, brother?",
  "62821": "So you are good enough to pass my appearance?",
  "62822": "Is it tobacco?",
  "62823": "I ask you what can I do?",
  "62824": "Could it have been an early hornet?",
  "62825": "Who is that?",
  "62826": "Can you drink anything?",
  "62827": "Why not pursue an end confessedly good by peaceable and regular means?",
  "62828": "Did he come to arrest me?",
  "62829": "Whither so fast, child?",
  "62830": "Ah, why will you not unseal my lips?",
  "62831": "Does this look like confidence?",
  "62832": "Has it gone well?",
  "62833": "Admires the jay the insect's gilded wings?",
  "62834": "And did they often get a chance to do that?",
  "62835": "And do I love?",
  "62836": "UNDER THE CROSS,' hey?",
  "62837": "What did you look at, so fixedly?",
  "62838": "Why stop?",
  "62839": "And of what are you so sure?",
  "62840": "And the friend he regards and describes as one in whom he has an interest, and the other as a stranger in whom he has no interest?",
  "62841": "Can't you see what a beautiful thing it would make?",
  "62842": "For all that, are not our dresses as beautiful as yours?",
  "62843": "Why are they fighting?",
  "62844": "Is the danger you apprehended last night gone by now, sir?",
  "62845": "When the winds blow and the seas flow?",
  "62846": "Do you call this acting the part of a man and a gentleman, sir?",
  "62847": "Why should not I eat birds?",
  "62848": "Shan't we see any more of him?",
  "62849": "A slap in the face?",
  "62850": "What have you to do with our independence?",
  "62851": "Are you sure you can get 'em out of their fix?",
  "62852": "What principle directed it?",
  "62853": "Besides, why should I say anything about it to him?",
  "62854": "How did you get this passport?",
  "62855": "The house is sold, then?",
  "62856": "Well, have ye heard the news?",
  "62857": "What kind of person is she?",
  "62858": "Did he hear me?",
  "62859": "You were his constant companion, then?",
  "62860": "Is it not rather an appeal to the proprietory instinct, the COMMERCIAL instinct?",
  "62861": "Is that true, mother?",
  "62862": "How once?",
  "62863": "Wot I say?",
  "62864": "They're a nice lot, ain't they?",
  "62865": "Well, and what does it signify whether it was he or I?",
  "62866": "What formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward?",
  "62867": "Would it be believed, that when near nineteen, any one could be so stupid as to build his hopes of future subsistence on an empty phial?",
  "62868": "For what?",
  "62869": "Is not this absurd?",
  "62870": "Do you know that I am to be beheaded outside this window?",
  "62871": "Eh, who's there?",
  "62872": "How many a year, did you say?",
  "62873": "You intend to show off your intelligence, I suppose?",
  "62874": "Did you want me?",
  "62875": "What are you talking about, man?",
  "62876": "Is it possible that even now, when I give you these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?",
  "62877": "But where were you going, when you met us?",
  "62878": "How do you tink she can be ven you leave her to kill herself so?",
  "62879": "D'Artagnan?",
  "62880": "I wonder where I shall be this time tomorrow?",
  "62881": "Taenarum?",
  "62882": "Cannot you understand that the time it takes to wink is a whole eternity if it severs me from the beauty of your face?",
  "62883": "Tomorrow, then, sire?",
  "62884": "And who are you?",
  "62885": "What did ye?",
  "62886": "Did you put out the lamp?",
  "62887": "How long would it last?",
  "62888": "Who is still to come?",
  "62889": "Should he abandon this man?",
  "62890": "How about the others?",
  "62891": "Has he brought his brig with him?",
  "62892": "And what are my instructions?",
  "62893": "To make that reply and then perish, what could be grander?",
  "62894": "Why do I?",
  "62895": "Where are we living?",
  "62896": "Would you like me to come with you now?",
  "62897": "Can you already understand?",
  "62898": "Were they in the front or in the rear of their generation?",
  "62899": "How could I be otherwise?",
  "62900": "On the contrary, but what dignity?",
  "62901": "Just now, but refrained out of politeness ?",
  "62902": "Are you trying to hide?",
  "62903": "Is the vicar in?",
  "62904": "How can you say such a thing?",
  "62905": "A secret?",
  "62906": "Did you want the carpenter, sir?",
  "62907": "Then why are you always alone in your room these days?",
  "62908": "Wouldn't you?",
  "62909": "Got shot?",
  "62910": "Don't you see they are trying to catch your eye?",
  "62911": "Who makes the waters flow?",
  "62912": "More money, I suppose?",
  "62913": "About you?",
  "62914": "You will be staying on here, I suppose?",
  "62915": "It is you who set out seven or eight months ago from your country to seek your fortune in the capital?",
  "62916": "Where's your uncle?",
  "62917": "Who in the world cares for YOU?",
  "62918": "Wot do you mean?",
  "62919": "Was it real, or only apparent?",

  "62927": "Done with their buttons?",
  "62928": "Av you anything to say agen it?",
  "62929": "To kill the turnkey?",
  "62930": "Could it have been a slight quivering of the nostrils that he had seen, or was it mad fancy playing a trick on him?",
  "62931": "Would it comfort, or would it wound you to have a similar painting?",
  "62932": "Who is in command here?",
  "62933": "Will you let me see you home?",
  "62934": "Will you take charge of the letter?",
  "62935": "Should not all that be eternal?",
  "62936": "But why prove that to me?",
  "62937": "And its aim is?",
  "62938": "What could be the meaning of such a change?",
  "62939": "Have there been any fresh developments?",
  "62940": "What are you about?",
  "62941": "I am to live at home?",
  "62942": "What joy would they have to bring hanging to the likes of me?",
  "62943": "Where did she go?",
  "62944": "But may I, mamma?",
  "62945": "And who are hearsed that die on the sea?",
  "62946": "How have you got here?",
  "62947": "How long has he left it?",

  "62949": "Now, from whom could these pages come?",
  "62950": "You will then be at my service?",
  "62951": "And pray, sir, what in the world is equal to it?",
  "62952": "Could it be that there should be happiness in store for her?",
  "62953": "And what would that be, think you?",
  "62954": "In whose name do you come?",
  "62955": "Where is my hat?",
  "62956": "But we'll gie 'em another song?",
  "62957": "Yet could I, in justice, or even in possibility, refuse this demand?",
  "62958": "What is the meaning of this?",
  "62959": "Will your majesty permit me to tell you the truth?",
  "62960": "Whatever can be the matter?",
  "62961": "Had the cooling of the globe produced it?",
  "62962": "Are you and your party ready?",

  "62975": "Is your honour mad?",
  "62976": "This dial with movable needle is a manometer, is it not?",
  "62977": "And how's it you're not afraid, sir, really now?",
  "62978": "This?",
  "62979": "Do you think I haven't kept an eye on you?",
  "62980": "Are you going to walk out with us after lunch?",
  "62981": "Have you been in it since your adventure?",
  "62982": "Wife with you?",
  "62983": "Why do you keep looking at me like that?",
  "62984": "Did he reject her eternally, or did he not?",
  "62985": "Will you not honor us by telling us who you are?",

  "63016": "What are you thinking of this evening?",
  "63017": "And do you now intend, on this account, to deny the debt?",
  "63018": "Are fathers unnatural, and children prodigal?",
  "63019": "Won't you leave it?",
  "63020": "Where shall I find a refuge?",
  "63021": "Who would live amidst perpetual wrangling, and scolding, and mutual reproaches?",
  "63022": "Why do you ask?",
  "63023": "The FACT of death doesn't really seem to matter much, does it?",
  "63024": "Say?",
  "63025": "For how can the tears of my neighbour benefit me?",

  "63027": "The officer of the guard, then, with his chessboard?",
  "63028": "Do you think the experiment will work?",
  "63029": "What is wrong?",
  "63030": "You don't believe it?",
  "63031": "And can you send me to the station this afternoon?",
  "63032": "Nor him?",
  "63033": "And have these pets got anything on THEIR minds, eh?",
  "63034": "Had you any emeralds?",
  "63035": "Why couldn't you sit still here till I told you to go?",
  "63036": "And are you going?",
  "63037": "At what o'clock was it raised?",
  "63038": "All of them?",

  "63040": "In the house?",
  "63041": "I say, what's the matter?",
  "63042": "Shall I go and dance before these demons and let them see what a human being can do?",
  "63043": "Why have men of superior endowments submitted to such degradation?",
  "63044": "You, a detective?",
  "63045": "Yes, but they are a long way off, those isles, are they not?",
  "63046": "Then after all my dreams, after all my patience, you do not love me at last?",
  "63047": "Now which are you going to marry?",
  "63048": "And how is your friend?",
  "63049": "Who forces you to do so?",

  "65078": "Then you'll not be wanting me any more tonight, ma'am?",
  "65079": "Jane, do you hear that nightingale singing in the wood?",
  "65080": "Where could they be going?",
  "65081": "Won't you?",
  "65082": "Not in regular government pay and employment, to lay traps?",
  "65083": "But who could affirm, who would dare to say, that the amiable fellow did not really see that which his two companions would not see?",
  "65084": "You can't recommend anything for the boy, I suppose?",
  "65085": "What was it that she wanted of him?",
  "65086": "Where are the nearest?",
  "65087": "How has he drawn you to himself?",
  "65088": "Not even of sending me a scrap of stuff for a new dress?",
  "65089": "If he cuts off one of his own toes, or one of his assistants', would you be very much astonished?",
  "65090": "Was the weather hot or cold?",
  "65091": "Where was my baggage?",
  "65092": "Authority?",
  "65093": "Tell him or not tell him?",
  "65094": "O you will let me hold your brave hand, stranger?",
  "65095": "You think so, my lord?",
  "65096": "In your left ear?",
  "65097": "Am I a soothsayer?",
  "65098": "Who shall live up to the great trust?",
  "65099": "Are we there already?",
  "65100": "And my council dares to temper and negotiate?",
  "65101": "How are you?",
  "65102": "But what?",
  "65103": "It was you, was it not?",
  "65104": "Am I not by?",
  "65105": "Have you given up loving her altogether?",
  "65106": "What good does it do?",
  "65107": "You have never heard her nephew play?",
  "65108": "And what is thy want?",
  "65109": "What sin, mademoiselle?",
  "65110": "Or that it is impossible to draw more than one right line betwixt any two points?",
  "65111": "Do you think I could ever skip like that?",
  "65112": "Can you send me to the station?",
  "65113": "When did you leave service?",
  "65114": "Well, what do you think of that?",
  "65115": "What DO you know of him?",
  "65116": "What good will he be to the tribe?",
  "65117": "What, did you come digging here entirely because of me?",
  "65118": "Do you feel that you have lost her?",
  "65119": "What, senor?",
  "65120": "Or the raspberry?",
  "65121": "What is there?",
  "65122": "What have you been after?",
  "65123": "You don't mean to say he stole money, do you?",
  "65124": "But who are all these?",
  "65125": "Well, what d'you think of it?",
  "65126": "Oh, I?",
  "65127": "You couldn't write?",
  "65128": "You here again?",
  "65129": "You have no trouble, I hope, to keep you waking?",
  "65130": "What is, or was, their address?",
  "65131": "But of what disease, then, did she die?",
  "65132": "Trodden upon by whom?",
  "65133": "Mighty men?",
  "65134": "No, but what do you mean?",
  "65135": "Yes, I am out of temper, and do you know why?",
  "65136": "Did you ever hear anything like your brother's eloquence?",
  "65137": "And what is the use of a fellow having a little money if it does not make him independent?",
  "65138": "Why have you no pride?",
  "65139": "Who are you, that you are to play with two young people's affections and break their hearts at your will?",
  "65140": "Yes?",
  "65141": "You mean, will it be prudent?",
  "65142": "What is justice?",
  "65143": "How so?",
  "65144": "Weren't you listening to me?",
  "65145": "What's in it?",
  "65146": "Did he himself find no cause for laughter on the earth?",
  "65147": "And who completed it as it now is?"
