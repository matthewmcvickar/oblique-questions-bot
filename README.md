# Oblique Questions Bot

[@obliquestions](https://twitter.com/obliquestions)

A Twitter bot that tweets random, no-context questions from Project Gutenberg books.


## Acknowledgements

I couldn't have created this bot without the help of the following tutorials and posts:

- [Sarah Kuehnle's 'Creating a Twitter bot with Node.js' series](http://ursooperduper.github.io/2014/10/27/twitter-bot-with-node-js-part-1.html)

- [Molly White's two-part series on Twitter bots](http://blog.mollywhite.net/twitter-bots-pt1/)

- Darius Kazemi's projects [examplebot](https://github.com/dariusk/examplebot) and [grunt-init-twitter-bot](https://github.com/dariusk/grunt-init-twitter-bot) were helpful, and his [gutencorpus](https://github.com/dariusk/gutencorpus) was indispensible in providing my initial corpus. Also helpful were his posts [How to make a Twitter bot](http://tinysubversions.com/2013/09/how-to-make-a-twitter-bot/) and [Basic Twitter bot etiquette](http://tinysubversions.com/2013/03/basic-twitter-bot-etiquette/).

Oblique Questions was inspired in name and in concept by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt's [Oblique Strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies).


## Afterword

This is my first Twitter bot. The idea for Oblique Questions came to me while walking the dog on Saturday, October 31, 2015. I started working on it the next day.
